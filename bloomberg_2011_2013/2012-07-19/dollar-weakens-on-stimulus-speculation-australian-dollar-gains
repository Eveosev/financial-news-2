The dollar fell against all of its
16 most-traded peers as speculation the  Federal Reserve  and the
Chinese government will take further steps to encourage economic
growth damped demand for safer assets.  The Australian and New Zealand dollars led gains in higher-
yielding currencies as European and Asian stocks advanced. The
euro dropped for a second day versus the yen as borrowing costs
increased at a Spanish debt sale.  China ’s Premier Wen Jiabao may
decide to cut banks’ reserve requirements when the cabinet meets
to discuss ways to spur growth. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
yesterday kept open the possibility of additional stimulus.  “In Asian trading today there was talk about an imminent
reserve requirement cut” in China, said  Derek Halpenny ,
European head of global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in  London . “The two days of testimony from
Bernanke has held out the hope of further steps from the Fed.
That hope is definitely still in the market.”  The U.S. currency fell 0.3 percent to 78.55 yen at 8:44
a.m.  New York  time and touched 78.43 yen, the lowest since June
5. The greenback slipped 0.1 percent to $1.2296 per euro after
reaching $1.2324, the weakest level since July 10. The euro
declined 0.2 percent to 96.59 yen.  The dollar remained lower versus the yen and euro after
Labor Department data showed more Americans than forecast filed
first-time claims for unemployment-insurance payments last week.
Applications for  jobless benefits  climbed by 34,000 to 386,000
in the week ended July 14, the figures showed. Economists in a
Bloomberg survey forecast 365,000 claims. The volatility in the
numbers was due to a change in the timing of annual automobile-
plant layoffs, a Labor Department spokesman said.  ‘Further Action’  Bernanke said in testimony to the House Financial Services
Committee yesterday in Washington that the central bank is
“prepared to take further action as appropriate to promote a
stronger economic recovery”  The Australian dollar rose for a fifth day, gaining 0.7
percent to $1.0438. The New Zealand currency gained 0.6 percent
to 80.49 U.S. cents.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 1 percent, and the  MSCI
Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares added 1.7 percent. Futures on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent.  The  implied volatility  of three-month options on Group of
Seven currencies fell to 8.64 percent, according to a JPMorgan
Chase & Co. measure, the lowest since November 2007. Lower
volatility makes investments in currencies with higher benchmark
lending rates more attractive because the risk in such trades is
that market moves will erase profits.  Euro Falls  The euro dropped against all of its major counterparts
except the dollar as  Spain ’s 10-year government bond yield
climbed above 7 percent following today’s debt sale. That was
the level that spurred  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  to seek
bailouts.  Spain sold 2.98 billion euros of notes due from 2014 to
2019, in line with its maximum target. The Bank of Spain said
demand for the two-year notes dropped to 1.9 times the amount
sold from 4.26 last month. The yield increased to 5.204 percent
from 4.335 percent at the previous sale on June 7.  “You’ve got Spanish 10-year yields at 7 percent and once
again we’re at this psychological level,” said  Simon Derrick ,
chief currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon Corp. in
London. “Once you get beyond there it tends to suggest
investors really have taken a view that there has to be a
bailout at some point. You’re going to see fairly consistent
pressure on the euro for quite some time to come.”  The euro has declined 2.8 percent in the past month, the
worst performance alongside the Swiss franc of the 10 developed-
nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. The dollar strengthened 0.6 percent, and the yen
appreciated 1.2 percent.  Krona Gains  The Swedish krona appreciated for a third day against the
dollar and euro, after yesterday climbing to the strongest since
December 2000 versus the European currency.  “The most extreme positioning is in the Swedish krona
right now,”  Geoffrey Yu , a London-based currency strategist at
UBS AG, said on Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” with  Guy Johnson . “Sweden is very exposed to euro-zone growth. The last
thing you want is growth collapsing for your biggest trading
partner when you have a record high currency.”  The krona advanced 0.1 percent 8.5063 per euro, and rose
0.2 percent to 6.9218 versus the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
