Spain ’s bonds fell, with 10-year
yields rising above 7 percent for the first time in a week,
after the nation’s cost of borrowing surged at a debt sale.  German two-year yields were below zero for a 10th day as
lawmakers backed a euro-area bailout of Spanish banks. Austrian,
Belgian and French yields fell to records amid demand for havens
with higher yields than Germany. Spain’s two-year notes dropped
for a fourth day as demand declined at auctions of 2.98 billion
euros ($3.65 billion) of debt. Ten-year yields above 7 percent
pushed  Greece ,  Portugal  and Ireland to seek international aid.  “Each time they pay this sort of yield to borrow small
amounts of money the dead weight they carry gets heavier,” said
 John Wraith , a fixed-income strategist at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch in London. “It’s a sign that control is slipping
in Spain. After the auction we saw core bonds advance a bit and
Spanish yields widen over them.”  Spain’s  two-year yield  climbed 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, to 5.16 percent at 5 p.m. London time,
extending its increase this week to 71 basis points. The 3.4
percent note due in April 2014 fell 0.235, or 2.35 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 97.08.  Spanish  10-year yields  rose five basis points to 7.01
percent after reaching 7.04 percent, the highest level since
July 10. The extra yield investors demand to hold the securities
instead of German bunds widened to as much as 583 basis points,
approaching the record of 589 basis points set on June 18.  Spanish Auction  The Madrid-based Treasury sold notes due in 2014 at an
average yield of 5.204 percent, compared with 4.335 percent when
they were last auctioned on June 7. It also sold five-year notes
at 6.459 percent, versus 6.072 percent on June 21, and seven-
year securities at an average yield of 6.701 percent.  Yields on German two-year notes, perceived to be among the
safest securities because of the nation’s AAA rating, climbed
one basis point to minus 0.053 percent. They fell to minus 0.074
percent yesterday, the lowest since Bloomberg began tracking the
securities in 1990.  Germany  sold two-year debt at a negative
yield for the first time yesterday.  Yields below zero mean investors who hold the securities to
maturity will receive less than they paid to buy them.  German debt returned 12 percent in the year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies, as
investors sought a haven from  Europe ’s financial crisis. French
and Finnish bonds each gained 11 percent as investors turned to
the securities of other so-called core and semi-core nations to
seek higher returns.  ‘Yield Pickup’  “The hunt for yield pickup is continuing, especially in
the non-bund core,” said Norbert Aul, a rates strategist at
Royal Bank of Canada in  London . “At the short-end,” German
yields should stay negative, he said.  France  sold 4.5 billion euros of five-year notes maturing
in July 2017 today at an average yield of 0.86 percent. On June
21, the country auctioned securities due in February 2017 at
1.43 percent.  France’s  five-year yield  fell four basis points today to
0.75 percent, after dropping to a record 0.728 percent.  German lawmakers backed the euro-area bailout of Spanish
banks after Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  gave assurances
that Spain will remain liable for the aid and parliament will be
consulted on each step of the rescue.  Lower-house lawmakers were forced to interrupt their summer
break as they were recalled to Berlin for a special session on
bank recapitalizations for Spain of as much as 100 billion
euros. They voted 473 to 97 in favor of the bill after the main
opposition parties were persuaded to back Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government and most coalition dissent quelled.  ‘Austerity Package’  “Spain seems confident that its sovereign debt crisis will
be overcome thanks to the aid pledged to banks and the agreed
austerity package,” Ulrich Wortberg, a strategist at Helaba
Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen in  Frankfurt , wrote in a note to
clients. “Market participants are rather skeptical as risk
premiums on Spanish bonds versus comparable bunds remain high.”  Volatility in Austrian government debt was the highest in
the euro area today, followed by Belgium and Spain, according to
measures of 10-year bonds, the spread between two-and 10-year
securities, and credit default swaps.  Austrian  10-year bond yields  fell to as low as 1.828
percent, and the rate on similar-maturity Belgian bonds dropped
to 2.426 percent, both the least on record.  To contact the reporters on this story:
