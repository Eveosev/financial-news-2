Audi AG, the world’s second-biggest
maker of luxury cars, completed the 860 million-euro ($1.06
billion) purchase of motorcycle maker Ducati Motor Holding SpA
and named Chief Executive Officer Rupert Stadler to the board.  Audi Chief Financial Officer Axel Strotbek and executive
Horst Glaser will also join the Italian manufacturer’s board
after the transaction was completed today, Bologna-based Ducati
said in an e-mailed statement.  Ducati, the maker of the Monster, Diavel and Superbike
models, was acquired by Audi’s Lamborghini sports-car unit from
Milan-based private-equity firm Investindustrial Advisors SpA.
Deliveries last year totaled about 42,000 motorcycles, with
revenue at 480 million euros. Ducati employs about 1,100 people.  Current Ducati managers “will stay on board and remain
responsible for business operations,” Juergen De Graeve, a
spokesman at Ingolstadt, Germany-based Audi, said earlier today.  Ducati CEO Gabriele Del Torchio will join Lamborghini’s
board, the motorcycle maker said.  Audi is owned by Wolfsburg, Germany-based  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,
 Europe ’s biggest carmaker. The division’s other assets in  Italy 
include design and technology unit Italdesign, founded by
Giorgetto Giugiaro, who sketched the first Volkswagen Golf
model.  To contact the reporter on this story:
