Japanese  stock   futures  were little
changed as U.S. companies reported better-than-expected
earnings, while economic reports missed estimates and the yen
rose to a six-week high against the dollar. Australian stock
futures rose after commodity prices gained.  American depositary receipts of carmaker  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203) , which depends on North America for a quarter of its
sales, were little changed from the closing share price in
Tokyo. Those of  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s second-
biggest oil and gas producer, added 0.2 percent after oil
advanced. Shares of Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. may be active in Tokyo
after the drugmaker raised its profit forecast.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
September closed at 8,800 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
8,790 in Osaka. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,790 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200  Index (CRY) 
climbed 0.1 percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index added 0.2
percent in Wellington.  “The shape of recovery is still uncertain,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage about $1 billion at Platypus Asset
Management Ltd. in Sydney. “Equity investors need to be patient
in any case, but more so at the present time. Valuations are
low, which means dividend yields are reasonable.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  fell 0.1 percent
today. The gauge added 0.3 percent in New York yesterday after
International Business Machines Corp., the biggest computer-
services provider, and  EBay Inc. (EBAY) , the largest Internet
marketplace, beat profit forecasts.  Home Sales  Gains in stocks may be limited after U.S. existing home
sales unexpectedly fell and manufacturing in the Philadelphia
region contracted for a third month.  The yen reached 78.43 per dollar yesterday, the highest
since June 5. A stronger yen cuts the value of overseas income
at Japanese exporters when repatriated.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum rose 1.3 percent
yesterday. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw
materials gained 0.2 percent.  Crude for August delivery increased 3.1 percent to settle
at $92.66 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 3.2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 9.5 percent increase by the
 S&P 500  and a 7.1 percent advance by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.9 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.3 for the S&P 500 and 11
for the Stoxx 600.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. gained 2.3 percent to 86.65 yesterday
in New York, snapping a three-day slump.  To contact the reporter on this story:
