John Ewan, the director in charge of
managing Libor at the British Bankers’ Association, has left to
join Thomson Reuters Corp., the U.K. trade group said today.  Ewan joined Thomson Reuters, which assists in setting the
BBA Libor rate, as head of business development for the
company’s benchmark operations.  “John Ewan is no longer at the BBA,”  Brian Mairs , a BBA
spokesman, said in a telephone interview today. “He left to
pursue a new opportunity to further his career.” Ewan joined
the BBA in 2005, according to his profile on networking website
LinkedIn.  The U.K. has come under fire for failing to address
problems in setting Libor years before the record 290 million-
pound ($456 million) fine against  Barclays (BARC)  Plc for attempting to
manipulate the benchmark last month.  Timothy F. Geithner , then
the  New York  Federal Reserve President, in June 2008 warned the
Bank of England that the method used to set the London interbank
offered rate was open to abuse.  Financial News reported the story earlier today.  Libor is derived from a survey of banks which are asked how
much it would cost them to borrow from each other for 15
different periods, from overnight to one year, in currencies
including dollars, euros, yen and Swiss francs. After a set
number of quotes are excluded, those remaining are averaged and
published for each currency by the BBA before noon.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
 Thomson Reuters  in selling financial and legal information and
trading systems.  To contact the reporters on this story:
