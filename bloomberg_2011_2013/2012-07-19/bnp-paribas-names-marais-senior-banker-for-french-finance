BNP Paribas SA (BNP) , the largest French
lender, has put Thierry Marais in charge of coverage of French
financial institutions, according to a memo obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Marais, 52, was head of corporate finance for banking
clients at the lender, and will now serve as senior banker for a
portfolio of French financial institutions, according to the
memo.  Jean-Sebastien Dietsch , 38, is taking over Maraisâ€™s former
responsibilities, while continuing to serve insurance clients, a
person with knowledge of the move said.  Marais has spent more than 10 years with BNP Paribas and
more than 20 years in mergers and acquisitions, beginning as a
financial analyst at ABN AMRO in Paris, the memo says. He worked
in mergers and acquisitions advisory at both Banque Stern and
Cie. Financiere Edmond de Rothschild before joining BNP in 2001.  Since then, he has advised BNP on major transactions such
as the acquisition of Fortis of  Belgium  and  Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro , or BNL, of  Italy .  Marais will report to Frederic Legmann, head of  investment
banking  for financial institutions in Europe, while Dietsch will
report to Thierry Varene, head of corporate finance at BNP.  An official at BNP declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
