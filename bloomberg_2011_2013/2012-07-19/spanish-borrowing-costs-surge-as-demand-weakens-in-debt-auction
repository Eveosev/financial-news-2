Spain  sold 2.98 billion euros ($3.66
billion) of notes, in line with its maximum target, and its
borrowing costs surged as demand for the securities weakened.
The country’s bonds fell after the sale.  The Madrid-based Treasury sold notes due in 2014 at an
average yield of 5.204 percent, compared with 4.335 percent when
they were last sold on June 7. It sold five-year notes at 6.459
percent, compared with 6.072 percent on June 21 and seven-year
securities at an average yield of 6.701 percent.  Demand for the two-year debt was 1.9 times the amount sold,
compared with 4.26 last month and the bid-to-cover for the 2017
securities was 2.06, compared with 3.44 in June, the Madrid-
based Treasury said. It set a maximum target of 3 billion euros
for the sale.  “Nothing looks good,”  Ioannis Sokos , a fixed-income
strategist at BNP Paribas in  London , said in a telephone
interview. “Spanish banks have been much less aggressive in
buying domestic bonds” as the effect of the  European Central
Bank ’s three-year loans fades.  Spain auctioned debt as lawmakers in Madrid debated
spending cuts in a Parliament protected by metal barriers and
police. In Berlin, German legislators prepared to ratify their
participation in the 100 billion-euro bailout of Spanish banks.  The benchmark 10-year bond yield jumped above 7 percent
after the sale from 6.962 percent yesterday to 7.03 percent at
11:25 a.m. in Madrid.  Spanish Banks  Spanish banks, which were among the main beneficiaries of
the ECB’s three-year emergency loans in December and February,
increased their holdings of domestic debt in the first quarter,
before scaling back in April and May, Treasury data show. They
held 28 percent of Spain’s outstanding debt in May, compared
with 29 percent in April and 17 percent at the end of last year.
Non-residents cut their holdings to 37 percent from 50 percent
in the five months through May.  Spain is focusing on selling shorter-dated debt to avoid
paying the 7 percent yields investors demand to lend for a
decade. Still, five-year benchmark yields rose to 6.4 percent
today, narrowing the gap with 10-year yields to 61 basis points
today from as wide as 154 basis points in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
