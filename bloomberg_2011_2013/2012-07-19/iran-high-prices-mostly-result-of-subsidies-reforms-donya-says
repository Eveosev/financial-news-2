Rising prices in  Iran  are mostly due
to the “incorrect implementation” of a program to reform
subsidies on energy and food,  Donya-e-Eqtesad  reported, citing
Iranian Parliament speaker  Ali Larijani .  High prices and unemployment are the country’s main issues
and they can be solved by focusing on local production, Larijani
said during a meeting with a cleric in the city of Qom,
according to the Tehran-based newspaper.  Precise planning is needed to address the problems,
Larijani said, without providing details.  Iran’s government started in December 2010 a five-year
program to gradually remove food and energy subsidies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
