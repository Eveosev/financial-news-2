Buckeye Partners LP (BPL)  shut its West
Shore pipeline on July 17 after a leak of gasoline near Elkhart
Lake, Wisconsin, and a federal agency is investigating the
spill.  The area where the leak occurred has been secured and the
company is reviewing the incident, according to a statement by
the company issued late yesterday. The 70,000-barrel-a-day line
transports refined products including gasoline, jet fuel and
diesel from  Chicago  to  Green Bay , Wisconsin.  The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration is investigating, Jeannie Layson, a spokeswoman
for the agency in Washington, said in an e-mailed statement.  There’s been no update to the information at this time,
Martin E. White, a Breinigsville, Pennsylvania-based spokesman,
said in an e-mail today.  “Upon detection of an abnormality in pipeline pressure,
indicating a possible release, the pipeline’s Control Center
took immediate action and shut down the pipeline system,” the
company said in the statement.  The line spilled 1,000 barrels of unleaded automotive
gasoline, according to a  filing  with the National Response
Center taken yesterday.  The closed section of pipeline is 10 miles (16 kilometers)
northwest of Milwaukee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
