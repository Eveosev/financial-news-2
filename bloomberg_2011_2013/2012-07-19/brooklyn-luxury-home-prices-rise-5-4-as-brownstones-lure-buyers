Luxury-home prices in Brooklyn,  New
York ’s most populous borough, increased 5.4 percent in the
second quarter as buyers sought the most expensive properties in
a market with limited inventory.  The median price of luxury co-ops, condominiums and one- to
three-family homes that changed hands rose to $1.37 million from
$1.3 million a year earlier, New York appraiser  Miller Samuel
Inc.  and broker  Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate  said
today in a report. The lower limit for Brooklyn luxury homes,
defined as the top 10 percent of all sales this quarter, was
$999,000, said  Jonathan Miller , president of Miller Samuel.  “The luxury buyer is out there now, and they’re looking
for opportunities,” Miller said in an interview. “Barring any
unforeseen changes, it’s going to be relatively tight at the
upper end of the market for the next year or two.”  A rise in demand for Brooklyn brownstones in the last six
months helped fuel the increase in luxury prices because there
is a relatively fixed supply of these properties, Miller said.
In northwest Brooklyn, home to neighborhoods including Park
Slope and Carroll Gardens, the median sales price for one- to
three-family homes jumped 9.5 percent to $1.32 million from $1.2
million a year earlier.  Prices in the broader  Brooklyn  market were little changed.
The median price of condos, co-ops and one- to three-family
homes that sold in the quarter fell 0.6 percent to $477,108,
according to the report. There were 1,988 transactions, up 2.4
percent from a year earlier.  Shrinking Supply  The supply of homes on the market tumbled 18 percent to
5,772 properties, according to the report. The absorption rate,
a measure of how long it would take to sell all the inventory at
the current pace of sales, fell 19 percent to 8.7 months from
10.8 months a year earlier.  The drop in supply failed to boost prices because potential
homebuyers faced tight credit restrictions or saw little urgency
to enter the market, Miller said.  “The expectation is, the economy is weak,  mortgage rates 
are probably going to stay at low levels for a while, ‘I’ll wait
for the right one to come along,’” he said.  The average interest  rate  for a  30-year fixed  U.S. home
loan fell to 3.56 percent in the week ended July 12, the lowest
in Freddie Mac records dating to 1971. The rate was 4 percent or
lower for the entire second quarter, according to the McLean,
Virginia-based mortgage-finance company.  Reduced Price  Stephen Donnarumma, 50, put his one-bedroom apartment in
Carroll Gardens on the market in May for $625,000, and didn’t
get any offers until he lowered the price six weeks later to
$575,000. After that, he received four bids within five days.  Donnarumma went into contract this week for the home, a co-
op on the fourth floor of a building completed in 1856, with an
all-cash offer for the asking price.  “That was a very strong clearing price,” said Donnarumma,
who was represented by Joan Goldberg from Brown Harris Stevens.  Homes took about 12 percent longer to sell than a year
earlier, averaging 159 days on the market, according to  Miller
Samuel  and Prudential. In the luxury segment, the average days
on the market fell to 109 from 123.  “There was extraordinary demand for luxury property and
very limited inventory to show,” said Michael Guerra, executive
vice president and managing director at Prudential Douglas
Elliman.  In Queens, the city’s second-most-populous borough, the
median sales price rose 3.8 percent from a year earlier to
$355,000, according to Miller Samuel and Prudential. The number
of sales dropped 2.3 percent to 2,306, while the supply of homes
for sale tumbled 33 percent to 8,754.  To contact the reporter on this story:
