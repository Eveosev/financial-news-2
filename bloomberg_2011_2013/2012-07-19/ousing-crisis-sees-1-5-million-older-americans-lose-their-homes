More than 1.5 million Americans aged
50 or more have lost their homes since the collapse of the
housing market in 2007 as delinquency rates and foreclosures
soar, according to advocacy group  AARP .  About 3.5 million loans, or one in six to people in the age
group, had balances that were higher than the value of the
property being purchased as of December, according to a  report 
by Lori Trawinksi for the Washington-based lobby.  “More older Americans are carrying mortgage debt than in
the past, and the amount of that debt is also increasing,”
Debra Whitman, AARP’s executive vice president for policy, said
in a statement. “Their economic situation is worsening.”  The percentage of loans to older Americans that are in
foreclosure or at least 90 days delinquent increased to 6
percent in December from 1.1. percent in 2007. That’s faster
than the rise to 7.5 percent from 1.6 percent for people younger
than 50. Last year, the foreclosure rate on prime loans for
older Americans was 23 times higher than the 0.1 percent rate in
2007, the report found.  Foreclosure rates for blacks and Hispanics who are 50 or
older were 3.5 percent and 3.9 percent in 2011. That’s nearly
double the 1.9 percent rate for white buyers, it found.  “This crisis is far from over,” Whitman said. “Many
loans remain in danger of falling into foreclosure.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
