Vietnam ’s five-year bonds rose for
the first time in 10 days on speculation banks will buy more
debt as an economic slowdown saps demand for loans. The dong
gained.  Banks face difficulties in lending as slowing growth
affects companies, the central bank said July 7. Credit growth
slowed to 0.76 percent in the first half, it said, compared with
the government’s full-year target of 14 percent to 15 percent.
Loans grew slower because of banks’ concern that bad loans are
rising, ACB Securities said in a research note today.  “The corporate financial situation isn’t very good and
banks are reluctant to give more loans,” said Hoang Thanh Tam,
head of the fixed-income department at Vietnam Maritime
Commercial Joint-Stock Bank in Hanoi. “There will be much
interest in bonds because  money supply  is still very high.”  The yield on five-year bonds fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 10.10 percent, according to a daily fixing
rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the first decline
since July 5.  The State Treasury will offer 1 trillion dong ($48 million)
of two-year bonds and 2 trillion dong of five-year debt at an
auction today according to a statement on the Hanoi Stock
Exchange’s website.  The dong traded at 20,843 per dollar as of 4:39 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,850 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its
reference rate at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to
its website. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
