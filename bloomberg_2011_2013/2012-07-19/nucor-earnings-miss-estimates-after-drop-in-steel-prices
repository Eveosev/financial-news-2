Nucor Corp. (NUE) , the largest U.S.
steelmaker by market value, posted second-quarter profit that
missed analysts’ estimates after prices for the metal fell.  Net income dropped to $112.3 million, or 35 cents a share,
from $299.8 million, or 94 cents, a year earlier, the  Charlotte ,
North Carolina-based company said today in a statement. Earnings
excluding an impairment charge on an Italian joint venture and
other items were 46 cents, trailing the 48-cent average of 20
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales were little changed at
$5.1 billion compared, exceeding the $5.06 billion average of 14
estimates.  Nucor said it expects a “modest reduction” in third-
quarter earnings excluding one-time charges.  “Continued slow domestic growth, coupled with continued or
worsening global economic uncertainty may both become increasing
negative factors,” the company said in the statement. “The
construction market continues to be very challenging.”  The price of hot-rolled steel coil, a benchmark product
used in autos and construction, averaged $658 a ton in the
quarter, 20 percent less than a year earlier, according to Steel
Business Briefing  data . Nucor said June 13 that second-quarter
profit would miss earlier guidance because a “surge” in
imports undermined prices and political and economic uncertainty
affected buyers’ confidence.  Nucor dropped 2 percent to $37.93 at 9:10 a.m. before the
start of regular trading in  New York .  (Nucor scheduled a conference call at 2 p.m. New York time,
