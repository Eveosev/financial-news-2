     July 19 (Bloomberg News) --  KeyCorp (KEY) ,  Ohio ’s second-largest
bank, may close 5 percent of its branches during the next 18
months as it cuts costs, said William Koehler, president of the
company’s community bank.  KeyCorp, which has 1,059 branches, is targeting $150
million to $200 million of expense reductions by December 2013,
the Cleveland-based lender said today in a statement.  KeyCorp is cutting costs amid slow U.S. gross domestic
product growth and uncertainties over regulatory changes,
targeting an efficiency ratio of 60 percent to 65 percent, Chief
Executive Officer Beth Mooney said on a conference call. The
bank is realigning its business plan to reflect a “new normal”
in the financial industry, she said.  “Extended low  interest rates , slow GDP, cautious sentiment
among American businesses, specifically in our client base, and
then you add the increasing cost of regulation that is impacting
us as well,” Mooney said. “We needed to be purposeful and
proactive in addressing our cost base and our plans for
revenue.”  Second-quarter operating net income fell 9.1 percent to
$221 million, or 23 cents a share, from $243 million, or 26
cents, in the same period last year, the bank said.  today in
the statement. That beat by 5 cents the  average estimate  of 25
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  KeyCorp gained 1 percent to close at $7.91 in New York. The
shares have climbed 2.9 percent this year, compared with a 16
percent increase in the 24-company KBW Bank Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
