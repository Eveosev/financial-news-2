Ford Motor Co. (F)  is recalling 11,500
new Escape sport-utility vehicles in  North America  because of a
risk of engine fires.  Ford, based in Dearborn,  Michigan , said today in a
statement posted on its website that it is recalling model year
2013 Escapes with 1.6-liter engines because engine compartment
fuel lines can split and leak fuel, causing fires under the
hood.  “Our intensive investigation and testing has identified
the area of concern and we are moving as quickly as possible to
repair vehicles for our customers,” Ray Nevi, assistant
director of Ford’s automotive safety office, said in the
statement. “In the meantime, it is extremely important that
affected customers not ignore this recall and immediately
contact their dealer.”  No injuries have been reported from the defect, the company
said. The recall doesn’t apply to Escapes with other engines.
Most of the vehicles in the recall were produced for sale in the
U.S., Ford said.  There have been three reports of engine fires, two of which
occurred before the vehicles were shipped from the factory,
Marcey Zwiebel, a Ford spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on
July 17 announced it was opening an investigation of about
730,000 older Escapes after receiving 99 complaints about
unintended acceleration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
