The U.K. Serious Fraud Office
dropped its investigation into two men arrested during its probe
into the collapse of Iceland’s  Kaupthing Bank hf .  The agency declined to identify the individuals. The Daily
Telegraph newspaper reported it was Armann Thorvaldsson, the
Kaupthing’s U.K. Chief Investment Officer, and its former
treasurer Gudni Adalsteinsson.  Two men arrested in the Kaupthing probe are “no longer
suspects and police bail is to be canceled,” the SFO said in a
statement.  The fraud watchdog last month ended its investigation into
businessman  Vincent Tchenguiz  after admitting it had made errors
in his arrest and the search of his offices. His brother Robert,
also arrested in raids last year, is still being probed by the
SFO in connection with Kaupthing loans. Both men are suing the
SFO for damages over the raids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
