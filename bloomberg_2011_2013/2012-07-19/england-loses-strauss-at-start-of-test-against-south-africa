England recovered to reach 158-1 at
tea on the opening day of the first cricket Test against South
Africa after losing captain  Andrew Strauss  in the first over.  Alastair Cook has scored 69 and Jonathan Trott is on 68 at
the Oval in London.  Strauss, who’d won the toss, was trapped leg-before-wicket
for no score by Morne Morkel on the fourth ball of the day.
Umpire Steve Davis rejected the South Africans’ appeal before
Strauss was given out on review.  The visitors failed to build on the early breakthrough and
the English batsmen proceeded to add runs at an overage of 3 an
over. South Africa captain  Graeme Smith , in his 100th Test, has
used six bowlers so far.  South Africa, ranked No. 3 in Tests by the International
Cricket Council, could leapfrog No. 1  England  by winning the
three-match series, which also has games at Leeds and at Lord’s
in London.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
