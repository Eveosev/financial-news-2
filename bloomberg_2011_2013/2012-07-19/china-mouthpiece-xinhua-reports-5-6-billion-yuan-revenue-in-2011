Xinhua  News Agency ,  China ’s official
news wire, reported revenue of 5.6 billion  yuan  ($884 million)
in 2011, a 72 percent gain from 2010, as the country pushes to
expand its influence around the world.  The government’s doubling of its allocation to Xinhua, to
1.9 billion yuan, accounted for most of the increase, according
to the report, which was posted on  www.gov.cn . Expenses were a
matching 5.6 billion yuan.  The report, released yesterday, sheds light on the
financial performance of an organization that’s at the center of
the government’s push for a greater voice in global affairs. In
January,  Wang Chen , head of the State Council Information
Office, said China must adopt “more forceful measures to spread
its voice” in efforts to inform people about its “values and
development pattern,” Xinhua reported at the time.  Xinhua is “striding toward a global modern state news
agency with Chinese socialist characteristics,” the agency
said.  The news agency has 166 bureaus worldwide and runs the 24-
hour CNC television network that broadcasts in more than 70
countries, according to the report. The report said that in
2011, Xinhua spent 16 million yuan on overseas trips, 26 million
yuan on vehicles and 2.9 million yuan on banquets.  The numbers were published as a government budget report,
not a financial statement, since Xinhua is an agency under the
State Council.  Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
Xinhua as a provider of finance news and information.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
