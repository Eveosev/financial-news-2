Free, the French mobile-phone
service owned by  Iliad SA (ILD) , sued  Vivendi SA (VIV)  unit SFR, claiming
its offer to subsidize handset purchases to customers who sign a
service contract constitutes unfair competition.  Free filed the complaint in May to the Paris commercial
court, a spokeswoman for the company said today, confirming
comments by Xavier Niel, who founded broadband-provider Iliad,
in today’s issue of  Capital  magazine.  The subsidies, which depend on the consumer committing to a
one- to two-year service contract, are effectively hidden
consumer credits that skirt the rules governing such offers, and
therefore constitute “usury rates of 300 to 400 percent that
consumers don’t see,” Niel said to Capital.  Iliad gained 2.6 million mobile subscribers in the first 80
days since it became  France ’s fourth mobile-network operator
this year, offering discounted packages starting at 2 euros
($2.46) to make inroads into the market. SFR, the wireless arm
of Vivendi, met with unions this month to discuss plans to cut
costs as it seeks to slow customer defections to Free.  No hearing has been scheduled, the spokeswoman said,
declining to be named as the matter is pending before the court.  The SFR press office didn’t immediately respond to requests
for comment on the lawsuit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
