The dollar may fall to a seven-week
low against the yen should it breach a level of so-called
support, Commerzbank AG said, citing trading patterns.  A sustained break below the June 15 low of 78.61 yen may
push the dollar toward a support level of 77.65 yen, according
to  Karen Jones , head of fixed-income, commodity and current
 technical analysis  in London. That’s the June low, she said in
the note. Support refers to an area on a price graph where
analysts anticipate orders to buy a security.  “Dollar-yen is under pressure and finally sold off,”
Jones wrote in a note to clients today.  The dollar fell for the fifth time in six days today,
weakening 0.3 percent to 78.57 yen at 3:45 p.m. London time. It
reached 77.66 yen on June 1, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The  currency pair  is trading below its 200-day moving
average of 79.07 yen, according to the data.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
