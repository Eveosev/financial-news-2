Asian  stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index headed toward its biggest gain in almost three
weeks, amid speculation China will do more to boost growth and
after U.S. housing starts jumped to the highest in four years.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies
jumped 2.4 percent as the country’s swap market signaled a
further reduction in the reserve ratio requirement for banks.

3.1 percent as crude prices exceeded $90 a barrel for the first
time since May.  Man Wah Holdings Ltd. (1999) , a sofa maker which gets

reports the U.S. and Chinese economies were slowing.  “So far we haven’t seen clear signs that the Chinese
economy is bottoming,” said  Yoji Takeda , who oversees $1.1
billion at RBC Global Asset Management in Hong Kong. “The U.S.
market has been firm and housing data was a bit stronger than
expected. Maybe its shows a relatively stable growth environment
in the U.S. Markets are relieved and maybe we’ll see short
covers coming in.”  The Asian benchmark, which contains some companies from
 emerging markets , trades at 11.8 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.2 times for the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPXL1)  and 10.9 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average advanced 0.8 percent.

its highest in two months. Singapore’s Straits Times Index rose
0.4 percent, gaining for a fifth day.  Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 1.7 percent, while
China’s Shanghai Composite Index advanced 0.7 percent. China has
“relatively large” room to boost fiscal spending to support
economic growth, Zhang Peng, a Beijing-based researcher with the
Ministry of Finance, said yesterday in a telephone interview.  China’s Premier Wen Jiabao will probably decide to cut
banks’ reserve requirements and encourage corporate lending as
the cabinet meets to discuss efforts to revive economic growth,
the swap market indicates.  The cost to lock in the three-month Shanghai interbank
offered rate for a year tumbled 28 basis points this month to

half net-income forecast 67 percent. The stock had the  biggest
gain  on the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP) , while  Samsung Electronics (005930) 
Co. was the largest contributor to the gauge’s advance.  Samsung Electronics, which makes Galaxy tablets, rose 3.6
percent to 1.195 million won in Seoul after Apple Inc. was
