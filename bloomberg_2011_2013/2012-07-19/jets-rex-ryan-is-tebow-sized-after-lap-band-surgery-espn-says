New York Jets coach  Rex Ryan  lost
more than 100 pounds following lap-band surgery and now weighs
about as much as backup quarterback  Tim Tebow ,  ESPN said .  With the opening of the National Football League team’s
training camp less than a week away, the 49-year-old Ryan said
he weighs 242 pounds, down from his 348-pound weight a few days
before the 2009 conference championship game. Tebow, who was
acquired by the Jets in the offseason, is listed at 236 pounds
on the  team’s roster . Both men stand about 6-foot-3.  “I think we look real similar, except he’s left-handed and
I’m right-handed,” Ryan joked during a media tour to promote
lap-band surgery, according to ESPN.  Ryan had the procedure in March 2010 and recommended it to
his twin brother, Rob, the  Dallas Cowboys ’ defensive
coordinator. Rob Ryan already has lost about 60 pounds in a few
months, ESPN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
