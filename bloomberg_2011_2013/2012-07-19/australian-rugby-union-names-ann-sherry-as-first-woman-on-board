The Australian Rugby Union appointed
its first female board member by naming Ann Sherry, the chief
executive officer of cruise ship operator Carnival  Australia , as
a director.  Sherry, the former CEO of  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) ’s New
Zealand business, replaces Rick Lee on the Sydney-based
governing body’s board, the ARU said today in a statement.  Her appointment will help grow the sport beyond its
traditional areas of support as rugby’s seven-a-side version
prepares for its Olympic inclusion at the 2016 games, ARU
Chairman Michael Hawker said.  “I am confident that Ann’s appointment, together with the
Olympic opportunities and ARU’s focus on rugby sevens, will
encourage more female participation in the sports of rugby union
and rugby sevens,” Hawker said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
