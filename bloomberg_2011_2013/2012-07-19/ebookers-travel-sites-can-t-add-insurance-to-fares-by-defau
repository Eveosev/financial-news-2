Orbitz Worldwide Inc. (OWW) ’s German
ebookers unit and other online travel agents can’t automatically
include travel cancellation insurance in the price of airline
tickets bought on the Internet, the European Union’s highest
court said.  “It is precisely because a customer is in a position to
make a choice that EU law requires such price supplements to be
communicated in a clear, transparent and unambiguous way at the
start of each booking process and that their acceptance must be
on an opt-in basis,” the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg said
in a statement today.  A German consumer-protection group sued ebookers.de for the
practice of presetting its website in such a way that travel
cancellation insurance is automatically added to clients’ flight
booking unless they opt out.  A German court last year asked the EU court whether such an
additional service should be offered on an opt-in rather than an
opt-out basis.  “There can now be consistency in the German market among
online travel agents, airlines and other providers on opt-in
versus opt-out for ancillary products,” Ebookers said in an e-
mailed statement. “Ebookers complies with all government rules
and regulations and will be reviewing this decision and updating
its website as appropriate.”  The case is: C-112/11, ebookers.com Deutschland GmbH v.
