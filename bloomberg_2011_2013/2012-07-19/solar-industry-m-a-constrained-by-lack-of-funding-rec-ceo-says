Mergers and acquisitions in the
solar  energy industry  are being constrained by a lack of
funding, according to Renewable Energy Corp. ASA’s Chief
Executive Officer, Ole Enger.  “With the financial status now in the solar industry,
there aren’t many companies that can afford to spend money on
mergers and that is holding it back,” he said in an interview
in Oslo today.  While “there are always approaches” in terms of mergers
and acquisitions, REC hasn’t seen anything “concrete,” Enger
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
