Financial aid sought by  Spain  from
its euro-area partners to shore up banks must be restricted to
viable lenders, the German government said.  Spain will face conditions in drawing as much as 100
billion euros ($123 billion) in aid for its banks, “of which
the most important is that they will be very carefully
scrutinized to see which ones can survive,” German Deputy
Finance Minister Thomas Steffen told state representatives in
the upper house of parliament in Berlin today. “Banks that
aren’t viable must be treated differently to those that are.”  Steffen said he has “every confidence” that the European
Commission, the European Union’s executive body, will apply its
subsidy rules in ascertaining whether Spain is using aid
appropriately by not propping up banks without a sustainable
business model. Aid conditions also foresee remuneration caps
for senior bankers working at lenders in receipt of aid, Steffen
said.  German lawmakers have signaled that they will approve
legislation that will anchor aid for Spain in national law in a
parliamentary vote today. In meetings this week, senior members
of  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s government have sought to allay
lawmakers’ misgivings, including concerns that the Spanish
government may not be liable for aid guarantees and that aid may
be misappropriated to prop up so-called zombie banks.  Merkel needs a simple majority for the aid bill in the
lower house. The session starts at 2 p.m. in Berlin. German
states represented in the upper house, which is controlled by
opposition parties, are not required to vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
