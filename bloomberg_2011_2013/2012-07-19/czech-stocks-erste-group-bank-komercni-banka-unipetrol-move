The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
gained the most in more than two weeks, rising 0.9 percent to
909.8 at the close of trading in Prague.  The following were among the most active  equities  in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Komercni Banka  AS (KOMB CP), Societe Generale SA’s Czech
unit, had its best day in six weeks, adding 3 percent to 3,559
koruna. Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)   rose 2.6 percent
to 388 koruna, its highest close in two weeks. Speculation that
central banks around the world will ease monetary conditions
boosted demand for riskier assets.  Unipetrol AS (UNIP)   dropped to the lowest since June 25
after the biggest Czech oil refiner said its second-quarter loss
before interest and tax will deepen from the January through
March period. The stock slid 0.6 percent to 168 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
