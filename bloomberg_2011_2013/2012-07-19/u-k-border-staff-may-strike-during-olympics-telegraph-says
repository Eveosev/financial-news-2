U.K. immigration staff at airports
and ports could walk out next week, causing chaos ahead of
Friday’s Olympic Games opening ceremony, the  Daily Telegraph 
reported.  Members of the U.K. Public and Commercial Services union
voted yesterday in favor of  strike action  in a row over jobs and
pay. The PCS said 57 percent of its members backed strike action
after 20 percent of the 16,000 Home Office staff balloted
responded, the newspaper said.  The union will decide later today what action to take as
hundreds of people, including athletes and officials, arrive in
London ahead of the Games. The PCS represents more than half of
the U.K. Border Force, which covers posts such as passport
control, the Telegraph said.  Immigration minister Damian Green said any action during
the Olympics was “completely unacceptable” and the public
would not support it, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
