The Indianapolis Colts signed
quarterback Andrew Luck, the top pick in this year’s  National
Football League  draft, to a four-year contract worth $22.1
million, according to NFL.com.  The Colts, who open their training camp on July 25, didn’t
disclose terms of Luck’s contract on their  website  last night.
He will get a $14.5 million signing bonus, NFL.com said, citing
people with knowledge of the contract who requested anonymity.  Luck, the Heisman Trophy runner-up the past two seasons at
Stanford University, went No. 1 overall to the Colts as the
replacement for four-time Most Valuable Player  Peyton Manning ,
who was cut in the offseason after 14 years with the team.  Luck, 22, is regarded by some scouts as the NFL’s best
quarterback prospect since Manning in 1998. He led Stanford to a
31-7 record over four seasons while winning multiple player of
the year honors and setting Pac-12 Conference career records for
passing efficiency and completion percentage.  The 6-foot-4 Luck probably will take over as starting
quarterback for a team that finished last season 2-14, tied for
the NFL’s worst record. Drew Stanton and Chandler Harnish are
the other quarterbacks listed on the Colts’ roster. Manning is
now with the  Denver Broncos .  Luck’s signing came a day after quarterback Robert Griffin III, the second pick in this year’s draft, penned a four-year,
$21.1 million contract with the  Washington Redskins .  To contact the reporter on this story:
