A 30 percent U.S. federal tax credit
for owners of solar-power systems pays for itself when
electricity from those systems is sold, creating taxable
revenue, a trade group said.  Residential and commercial rooftop solar systems that sell
electricity through power-purchase agreements or that are leased
to homeowners or businesses, generate a 10 percent rate of
return on the credit, the American Council on  Renewable Energy 
said today in a  statement . The analysis of the solar  investment
tax credit , which expires at the end of 2016, used models from
SolarCity Inc.  Over a 30-year period, a $10,500 tax credit for a
residential system can generate on average $22,882 in  tax
revenue , Acore found. A $300,000 credit for a large commercial
project may create $677,627, the study found.  “The purpose of the study is to destroy any myth that the
ITC is costly to the taxpayer,” said Lyndon Rive, chief
executive officer of  San Mateo , California-based SolarCity in an
interview today. “It’s the right thing to do, but it’s done
under the emotion of a sacrifice.”  In reality, Rive said, “this is actually a good investment
too.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
