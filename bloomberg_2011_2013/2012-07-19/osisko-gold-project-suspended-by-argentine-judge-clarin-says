Osisko Mining Corp. (OSK) , a Canadian
company exploring for gold in Argentina, was ordered to halt a
mining project until it provides an environmental report, Clarin
reported today.  Judge Daniel Flores of northwestern La Rioja province
suspended an agreement signed last year with the provincial
government until Osisko hands an inventory of glaciers in the
Famatina area, in the foothills of the Andes, the Buenos Aires-
based newspaper said, citing the judge.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the worldâ€™s biggest gold producer,
suspended exploration in the same area in 2007, following local
protests against environmental harm caused by cyanide, a toxic
chemical compound used to separate gold from ore, Clarin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
