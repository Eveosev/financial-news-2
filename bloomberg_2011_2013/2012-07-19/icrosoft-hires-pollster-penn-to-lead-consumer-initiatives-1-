Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  has hired Mark Penn
as corporate vice president for strategic and special projects,
reporting to Chief Executive Officer  Steve Ballmer  as the
company readies new offerings for the tablet-computer market.  Penn, 58, was the worldwide CEO of the public relations
firm Burson-Marsteller and CEO of the polling firm Penn Schoen
Berland LLC, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said in a
statement today. Penn will focus on key consumer initiatives,
Microsoft said.  Microsoft, the world’s biggest software maker, plans this
year to release its own tablet, called Surface, and Windows 8,
the newest version of its operating system, to help it win back
consumers and narrow Apple Inc.’s lead in the tablet market. The
company is also introducing an update of its Office software
suite with social and cloud-computing features that will work
with touch-screen devices running Windows 8.  “Mark has an incredible background in research,
demographics, marketing and positioning and a proven history in
developing unique insights that drive success,” Ballmer said in
the statement. “With a strong set of products and an exciting
pipeline for the next year, Mark’s experience and out-of-the-box
thinking will help us more effectively reach new consumers and
grow market share.”  Burson-Marsteller promoted Donald Baer as worldwide CEO,
the public relations firm said in a separate statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
