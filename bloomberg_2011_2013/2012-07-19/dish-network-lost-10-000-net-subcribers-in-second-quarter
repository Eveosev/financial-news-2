Dish Network Corp. (DISH) , the second-
largest U.S. satellite-television operator, lost about 10,000
net subscribers in the second quarter, fewer than some analysts’
estimates.  Marci Ryvicker, an analyst at  Wells Fargo & Co ., had
anticipated Dish to lose 119,000 subscribers, while Douglas Mitchelson, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, projected a loss of
115,000 customers. Englewood, Colorado-based Dish made the
announcement in a regulatory filing today.  The figure marks an improvement for Dish from a year
earlier, when the company lost 135,000 net subscribers. The
results “should ease investor fears about Dish’s core
business,” Ryvicker, who is based in  New York , wrote in a note
to clients today. She has an outperform rating on the shares,
the equivalent of a buy recommendation.  Dish is trying to transform itself from a stand-alone video
provider to a wireless company and is awaiting FCC approval to
use its spectrum to transmit mobile video. Chairman and founder
 Charlie Ergen  has said customers are no longer satisfied with a
company that only provides TV signals to the home.  Dish added 665,000 gross new subscribers in the quarter, up
16 percent from a year earlier, according to the filing. The
results don’t account for Dish’s decision to drop AMC Networks
Inc. around midnight July 1. The company is scheduled to report
second-quarter earnings next month.  Dish  rose  3.6 percent to $29.88 at the close in New York.
Shares have gained 4.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
