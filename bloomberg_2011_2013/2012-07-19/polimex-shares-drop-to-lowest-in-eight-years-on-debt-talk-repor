Polimex-Mostostal SA (PXM)  slumped to an
eight-year low after  Puls Biznesu  reported Poland’s second-
largest construction company is still in talks about a four-
month delay in paying back its debts.  The shares  lost  as much as 9.1 percent to 0.6 zloty, and
traded 7.6 percent weaker to 0.61 zloty, the lowest level since
July 2004, at 9:38 a.m. in Warsaw.  Bank Gospodarki Zywnosciowej SA (BGZ) , controlled by Rabobank
Groep, doesn’t want to sign a standstill agreement, while as
many as 95 percent of Polimex’s remaining creditors are ready to
join the deal, the newspaper reported, without saying where it
got the information. Polish builders saw earnings decline and
debt soar as costs of building stadiums and roads for the
European soccer championships increased.  The bank’s press office declined to comment, Puls said.
Polimex has 250 million zloty ($74 million) of debt due this
month, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
