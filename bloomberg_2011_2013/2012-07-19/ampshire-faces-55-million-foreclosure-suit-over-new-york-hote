Hampshire Hotels & Resorts LLC and
its partners defaulted on $55 million in debt backed by  The
Time , according to a lawsuit filed by LNR Partners, which is
seeking to foreclose on the hotel near  New York ’s Times Square.  Hampshire Hotels , the management arm of Chatwal Hotels &
Resorts, and Liechtenstein-based Marko Trust have missed
payments of $619,511 due each month since Jan. 11, according to
the complaint, filed by Miami-based LNR in New York State
Supreme Court on July 13. LNR, which owns the loan, asked the
court to appoint a receiver, trustee or liquidator for the
property.  The loan is backed by the 192-room boutique hotel, located
at 224 West 49th St. Overnight rates at the property started at
$153 this week, according to the Time website. The borrowers
first defaulted on the debt in November 2009, then reached a
forbearance agreement that lasted until November 2011, according
to the complaint. LNR has held the loan since May.  The complaint was reported on the Real Deal’s website
earlier today. The Time has faced cost pressures after becoming
unionized and because of competition from such rivals as the  W
New York Times Square , Jay Stein, Hampshire’s chief operating
officer, told the Real Deal.  Stein didn’t immediately return a telephone call from
Bloomberg today seeking comment on the complaint.  Bud Perrone , a
spokesman for LNR with Rubenstein Communications Inc., declined
to comment on the complaint.  The case is LBUBS 2006-C3 Lodging 224 LLC v. Consultant
Hotel Associates, 850063/2012, New York state Supreme Court
( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
