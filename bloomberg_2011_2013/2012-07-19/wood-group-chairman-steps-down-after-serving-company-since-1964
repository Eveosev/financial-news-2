Ian Wood  will retire as chairman of
 John Wood Group Plc (WG/) , a U.K. oil services provider active in
 Africa  and the  Middle East , after being with the company since
1964.  Wood will step down as the chairman after 30 years and will
leave the board from Nov. 1, the Aberdeen, Scotland-based
company said today in a statement. He will be replaced by
Allister Langlands, who serves as the chief executive officer.
Bob Keiller, the CEO of Wood Group’s PSN unit, will head the
company replacing Langlands.  “We are performing well in a strong market, with a great
management team and good prospects and this is an opportune time
to retire, particularly as we have in place a strong management
succession plan,” Wood said in the statement.  Wood is grandson of  William Wood , who founded Wood &
Davidson, a ship and marine engineering firm, in 1912. During
Ian Wood’s tenure, the company expanded operations into the oil
service industry when crude was discovered in the  North Sea  in
1970s. The company employs more than 41,000 people and is
operating in 50 countries now.  To contact the reporter on this story:
