Semiconductor revenue worldwide will
grow 4.6 percent to $315 billion this year, helped by strong
demand for smartphones, tablets and automotive electronics,
according to a report today from IDC.  Next year, sales will climb 6.2 percent to $335 billion,
the Framingham, Massachusetts-based researcher said in the
report. Revenue will increase at a compound annual growth rate
of 4.8 percent from 2011 to 2016, reaching $380 billion in 2016,
IDC said.  Supply constraints are easing on semiconductor products,
such as processors for smartphone applications and personal-
computer discrete graphics, and the industry has recovered from
flooding in  Thailand  that caused a shortage of hard drives,
according to the report. Semiconductor sales will also get a
boost from the debut this year of Microsoft Corp.’s Windows 8
operating system and next-generation smartphones.  “As we forecasted earlier this year, the cyclical
semiconductor downturn that started in the middle of last year
reached bottom in the second quarter of 2012,” said Mali
Venkatesan, research manager for semiconductors at IDC, in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
