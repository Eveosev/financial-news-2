Wheat futures jumped to the highest
in almost four years as the worst drought since 1956 erodes crop
prospects in the U.S. and dry weather hurts production in
 Australia  and Russia.  Little rain will fall during the next seven to 10 days in
the northern Great Plains of the U.S., the world’s biggest wheat
exporter, forecaster Telvent DTN said in a report. Australia
will be drier-than-normal for the next three months, the Bureau
of Meteorology said. Russian farmers will collect 46.5 million
metric tons of the grain in the year that began July 1, down 4.1
percent from 2011, researcher SovEcon said.  “Look at what’s going on in the U.S. and look at what’s
going on in Australia and Russia, and people are looking at
drawing down world carryout,” Mike O’Dea, a risk management
consultant at INTL FCStone in  Kansas City , Missouri, said by
telephone today. “There are a lot of people talking up wheat
right now.”  Wheat futures for September delivery rose 3.5 percent to
settle at $9.35 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after reaching $9.38, the highest for a most-active
contract since Aug. 21, 2008. Prices have surged 49 percent
since mid-June.  Farmers in  Argentina  will reduce wheat planting by 22
percent in the 2012-2013 crop year, the Rosario Cereals Exchange
said yesterday. Australia is the second-biggest exporter,
followed by Canada, Russia, Kazakhstan and Argentina, according
to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
