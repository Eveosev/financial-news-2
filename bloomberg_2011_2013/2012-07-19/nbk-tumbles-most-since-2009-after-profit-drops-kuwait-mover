National Bank of Kuwait  slumped the
most in more than two years after the country’s biggest lender
reported a 40 percent drop in second-quarter profit, missing
analysts’ estimates.  The shares lost 5.7 percent, the biggest drop since
November 2009, to 1,000 fils at the close in Kuwait. The
benchmark index fell 0.4 percent.  Net income declined to 39.8 million dinars ($141 million)
from 65.9 million dinars a year earlier. The mean estimate of
four analysts was for a profit of 81.5 million dinars, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank set aside $96.4 million
in “judgmental provisions in face of a further potential
deterioration in our operating environment,” Chief Executive
Officer Ibrahim Dabdoub said yesterday.  The earnings offered a “highly negative surprise,” Naveed Ahmed, senior financial analyst at Kuwait-based Global
Investment House, wrote in a note to clients today. The
performance “is likely to lead us to revise our projections for
2012 downwards,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
