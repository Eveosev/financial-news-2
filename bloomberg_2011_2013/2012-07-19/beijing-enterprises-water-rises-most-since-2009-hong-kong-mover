Beijing Enterprises Water Group
Ltd. (371) , the sewage treatment unit of  Beijing Enterprises Holdings
Ltd. (392) , climbed the most in more than three years after agreeing
to a reduced price for assets it’s acquiring from its parent.  The shares  jumped  16 percent in Hong Kong trading to
HK$1.57, their highest in seven weeks and most since March 2009,
topping the benchmark  Hang Seng Index ’s 1.7 percent gain.  Beijing Enterprises Water agreed in January 2011 to issue
new shares at HK$1.9788 to its parent for sewage treatment and
water supply assets. The companies yesterday said they would
lower the placement price to HK$1.62 apiece, according to a
statement to the Hong Kong exchange.  “We expect the transaction to be completed now that the
two sides have agreed on a share-placement price,” Elaine Wu,
an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., wrote in a research note.
The asset injection will be “value-accretive” for Hong Kong-
based Beijing Enterprises Water, said Wu, who raised the stock’s
 rating  to “overweight” from “neutral.”  Beijing Enterprises Holdings owns a 44 percent  stake  in the
water-treatment operator, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Beijing Enterprises Water shares have fallen 26 percent
this year compared with a 6.1 percent Hang Seng Index gain. The
company had 65 sewage treatment plants and eight water supply
facilities in  China  as of December, according to its annual
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
