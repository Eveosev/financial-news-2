Soybean futures rose to a record as
the worst drought in more than 50 years threatens to damage
crops in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower.  Severe to exceptional  drought  expanded to 48 percent of the
Midwest as of July 17 from 33 percent a week earlier, the
government said today. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  has
declared almost 1,300 counties in 29 states as natural-disaster
areas. Fields are in the worst condition since 1988, when
drought reduced soybean production by 20 percent from a year
earlier.  “Soybeans are going downhill fast, and there are few signs
for relief,” Gregg Hunt, a market analyst at Archer Financial
Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.
“Expanding drought will lead very tight U.S. supplies and
higher prices to slow demand.”  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 2 percent to
settle at $16.5225 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after reaching a record $16.7375. The previous all-time
high for the most-active contract was $16.3675 on July 3, 2008.  The December futures contract for soybean meal, a livestock
feed, rose 1.7 percent to $487.30 for 2,000 pounds on the CBOT,
after advancing by the exchange limit of $20 to a record $499.
The price is up 18 percent this month.  Soybeans are the second-largest U.S. crop, behind corn,
valued at $35.8 billion in 2011, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
