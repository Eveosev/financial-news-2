Bankinter SA (BKT) , the first Spanish bank
to report earnings, posted a second-quarter loss after complying
with a government order to book higher real estate provisions.  The loss of 26.8 million euros ($33 million) compared with
a profit of 51.7 million euros a year earlier, the Madrid-based
lender said in a filing to regulators today. The average
estimate of seven analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg was for a
profit of 15.5 million euros. Bankinter shares rose.  Lenders are responding to two orders this year to recognize
more losses on real estate as the government seeks to bolster
confidence in the banking system and lower  Spain ’s borrowing
costs amid a five-year property slump. Bankinter, which has half
of its loans in mortgages, said it set aside 275.2 million euros
in the first half to comply with the cleanup ahead of schedule.  Bankinter climbed as much as 3.3 percent in Madrid trading
and was up 2.3 percent to 2.50 euros at 10.01 a.m., boosting the
bank’s market value to 1.34 billion euros.  Net interest income rose 27 percent to 174 million euros as
the margin between lending yields and the cost of liabilities
widened, the lender said. Bad loans as a proportion of total
lending increased to 3.91 percent in June from 3.67 percent in
March, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
