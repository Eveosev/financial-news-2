The University of Pittsburgh’s
athletic programs will join the Atlantic Coast Conference in
2013 after agreeing to pay the  Big East Conference  a $7.5
million cash buyout.  Syracuse University  and the  Big East  reached the same
agreement three days ago. Both Pittsburgh and Syracuse accepted
invitations to the ACC in September.  The Big East typically requires schools to pay a $5 million
exit fee and give 27-month notice before leaving. As part of the
agreement, Big East members will vote to terminate the
membership of Pittsburgh and Syracuse effective July 1, 2013.  “We have appreciated and enjoyed our membership in the Big
East and wish them much success in the future,” Pittsburgh
Athletic Director Steve Pederson said. “We are anxious to
compete in our final season in the Big East and look forward to
an exciting future in the Atlantic Coast Conference.”  In addition to losing Pitt and Syracuse, the Big East had
 Texas Christian University  and West Virginia depart for the Big
12 conference. The Big East yesterday dropped a lawsuit against
TCU, which left before it ever played a game in the league.  The conference offset those losses by adding eight new
members. Temple University will join this year. The University
of Memphis,  Southern Methodist University , the University of
Central Florida, the University of Houston, Boise State
University and San Diego State University will join in 2013, and
the U.S. Naval Academy will be added in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
