Cemoi, a French chocolate maker,
plans to boost purchases of  Ivory Coast  cocoa beans to 150,000
metric tons a season, chief executive officer Patrick Poirrier
said.  The Perpignan-based company currently buys 100,000 tons of
beans during the harvest, Poirrier told reporters today in Ivory
Coast’s commercial capital, Abidjan. About 70,000 tons are
ground into cocoa butter and other products in its processing
plant in the city, he said.  Ivory Coast, the world’s top cocoa grower, produced 1.5
million tons of the crop in the 2010-2011 harvesting season,
according to the London-based International Cocoa Organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
