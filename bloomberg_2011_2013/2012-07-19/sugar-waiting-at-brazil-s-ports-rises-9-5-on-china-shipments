The amount of sugar waiting to be
loaded at main ports in  Brazil , the world’s largest producer,
climbed 9.5 percent on increased shipments to  China , according
to shipping agency Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda.  About 3.04 million metric tons was ready for loading
yesterday at Vitoria, Paranagua and Santos, according to
Williams Brasil in Recife. That was up from 2.78 million tons a
week earlier. About 22 percent of all the sugar, or 679,500
tons, was scheduled to go to China, the second-biggest global
consumer of sugar after  India .  “The congestion created at the Brazilian ports is made of
old sales and the traditional shipments to the Gulf, MENA and
African refineries,”  Naim Beydoun , a broker at Swiss Sugar
Brokers in Rolle, Switzerland, said in a report e-mailed
yesterday. China is unlikely to maintain the pace of imports,
with some buyers already looking to sell back sugar, he said.  China is forecast to import 3.1 million tons of the
sweetener in the 2011-12 season begun in October, 1 million tons
more than a year earlier, the  International Sugar Organization 
in London estimates. Imports in the first eight months of the
season totaled 2.33 million tons, up from 824,000 tons a year
earlier, it said.  The possibility of slowing Chinese imports is “the only
bearish story” in sugar, Gordon Wayne, a strategist at UBS AG
in  New York , said in a report e-mailed yesterday. Above-average
rain in Brazil’s center south, the country’s main growing
region, has delayed harvesting and shipments.  Sugar output in the region fell 29 percent to 6.7 million
tons from the start of the 2012-13 season there through the end
of June, according to data from industry group Unica. Raw sugar
traded in New York climbed 8.2 percent last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
