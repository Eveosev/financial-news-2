England recovered to reach 267-3 at
stumps on the opening day of the first cricket Test against
South Africa after losing captain  Andrew Strauss  on the fourth
ball of the match.  Alastair Cook  got his 20th Test century.  Cook and Jonathan Trott batted for much of the day, putting
on 170 for the second wicket before Trott was caught by stand-in
wicketkeeper AB de Villiers for 71. Cook ended the day on 114
not out, with Ian Bell on 10 at the Oval in London.  Kevin Pietersen, South African-born like Strauss and Trott,
scored 42 before he fell to a short ball from  Jacques Kallis ,
caught off his glove by De Villiers at 251-3.  Strauss, who’d won the toss, was trapped leg-before-wicket
for no score by  Morne Morkel . Umpire Steve Davis rejected the
South Africans’ appeal before Strauss was given out on review.  South African captain  Graeme Smith , in his 100th Test, used
six bowlers during the day, with Morkel taking 2-44.  De Villiers was playing as wicketkeeper after Mark Boucher
sustained an eye injury earlier this month that led to the end
of his international career.  South Africa, ranked the No. 3 Test team in International
Cricket Council rankings, could leapfrog No. 1 England by
winning the three-match series, which also has games at Leeds
and at Lord’s in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
