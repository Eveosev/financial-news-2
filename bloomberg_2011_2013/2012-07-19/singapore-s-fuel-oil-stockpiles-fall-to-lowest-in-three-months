  Singapore ’s stockpiles of  fuel oil 
fell to the lowest level in three months, according to data from
the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore inventories of  residues , a category that includes
fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy residue and excludes bitumen,
dropped 16 percent to 17.37 million barrels in the week ended
July 18,  International Enterprise Singapore , a unit of the
ministry, said today in an e-mailed statement. Supplies are at
the lowest since the week ended April 18.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  such as naphtha, reformate
and gasoline, declined 5.5 percent to 9.65 million barrels, the
lowest since the end of May.  Middle distillates , a category that
includes gasoil and kerosene, rose 4.5 percent to 9.36 million
barrels.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
