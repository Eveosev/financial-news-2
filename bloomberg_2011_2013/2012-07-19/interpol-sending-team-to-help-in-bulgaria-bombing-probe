Interpol is dispatching a team from
its headquarters in Lyon,  France , to assist in the investigation
into yesterday’s Bulgarian bus bombing in which six Israeli
tourists were killed, the agency said in an e-mailed statement.  The team will consist of specialized officers from
Interpol’s Public Safety and Terrorism unit, according to the
statement.  Interpol said false identity documents reported to have
been found on the body of the bombing suspect can be checked
against the 33 million entries in its Stolen and Lost Travel
Documents database and it may be able to determine whether the
person used the documents at any stage in his journey to
Bulgaria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
