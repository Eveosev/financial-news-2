Unipetrol AS (UNIP)  shares fell, headed for
a two-year low, after the biggest Czech oil refiner said its
second-quarter loss before interest and tax will deepen from the
January through March period.  The stock slid 1.2 percent to 167 koruna by 1:50 p.m. in
Prague. A close at that level would be the lowest since March
2010 and would mark Unipetrolâ€™s biggest daily drop since May 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
