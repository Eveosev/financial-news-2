Peru ’s sol held near a 15-year high
amid rising dollar inflows as foreign investors purchased local
bonds and companies bought the currency to pay worker bonuses
this month.  The sol earlier gained 0.1 percent before closing little
changed at 2.6207 per  U.S. dollar , according to Bloomberg
prices. Data from Peru’s financial regulator shows it closed at
2.6190 on July 17 and 18, its strongest level since 1997.  The central bank  bought  $164 million in the  spot market 
today to slow the sol’s advance, extending its purchases this
month to $745 million.  “We normally see gains in the sol in July as companies
pay” salary bonuses, said Gonzalo Navarro, the head trader at
 Banco Santander  in Lima. “We’ve seen it happen all this week.
Positive markets and inflows drive gains and then the central
bank comes in and the sol closes flat.”  The yield on the nation’s 7.84 percent sol-denominated bond
due in August 2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 4.63 percent today, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The price rose 0.09 centimo to 121.26 centimos per
sol.  The Finance Ministry today sold bonds due September 2023
and February 2042 in its second local debt issuance this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
