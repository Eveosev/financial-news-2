Geico, the third-largest U.S. auto
insurer, said it is returning to the market of covering classic
and vintage vehicles.  “The collector car product ensures all Geico policyholders
are covered regardless of their make and model and gives our
customers another option to keep all of their business under the
Geico umbrella,” John Zinno, vice president of the auto
insurer, which is owned by  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) , said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
