Komercni Banka  AS, a unit of Societe
Generale SA, and Austriaâ€™s  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  led Czech shares
higher as speculation that central banks around the world will
ease monetary conditions boosted demand for riskier assets.  Komercni Banka rallied 2.8 percent to 3,550 koruna by 1:32
p.m. in  Prague , a third day of gains. Erste added 1.6 percent to
384.2 koruna. The  PX (PX)  equity index, in which the two lenders have
a combined 38 percent weighting, increased 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
