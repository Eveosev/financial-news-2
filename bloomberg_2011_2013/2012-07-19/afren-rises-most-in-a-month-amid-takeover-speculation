Afren Plc (AFR) , a U.K.-based explorer
focused on Nigeria and  Iraq , rose to a two-month high in London
after an exploration well in the Iraqi region of Kurdistan
flowed oil.  Afren jumped 7.7 percent to 128 pence, the highest since
May 3. The stock is up 49 percent this year, valuing the London-
based company at 1.4 billion pounds ($2.2 billion).  The Simrit-2 exploration well flowed at a rate of 13,548
barrels of oil a day from three out of 12 zones to be tested,
Afren said today in a statement. It was extended to a depth of
3,800 meters (12,468 feet) and the total net oil pay increased
to 460 meters.  “Another excellent result on the Kurdish block acquired
last year,” Stuart Joyner, head of oil and gas analysis at
Investec Bank Plc, said in an e-mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
