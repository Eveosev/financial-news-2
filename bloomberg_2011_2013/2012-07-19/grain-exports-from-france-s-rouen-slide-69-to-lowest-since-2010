Grain exports from the French port
of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, fell 69 percent
in the latest week to the lowest since at least August 2010.  Cargoes slid to 8,440 metric tons between July 12 and July
18 from 27,026 tons a week earlier, the  Seine River port  wrote
in an e-mailed report today.  The U.K. was the sole destination with 4,040 tons of soft
wheat and 4,400 tons of feed barley.  Rouen accounted for 41 percent of France’s grain exports by
sea in 2010-11, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay and
Dunkirk on the  North Sea , which shipped out 17 percent and 11
percent respectively, according to port figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
