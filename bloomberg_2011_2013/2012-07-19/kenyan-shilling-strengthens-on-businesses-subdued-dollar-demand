Kenya ’s shilling strengthened to the
highest in a week on subdued dollar demand by businesses.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy appreciated
as much as 0.2 percent to 83.85 per dollar and last traded less
than 0.1 percent up at 84, the highest since July 12, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The Kenyan shilling will rise slightly against U.S.
dollar as we expect demand and supply being evenly matched,”
Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB)  said in a note to clients today. The
currency would trade at about 83.90 to 84.30, the bank said.  The Central Bank of Kenya stayed out of the money market
today, according to an official, who asked not to be identified
in line with policy. This is the first day since June 27 the
bank hasn’t offered  repurchase agreements  or term-auction
deposits to curb money supply.  Uganda’s shilling weakened 0.2 percent to close at 2,467.49
per dollar, while the Tanzanian shilling was unchanged at 1,585
per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
