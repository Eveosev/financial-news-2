Saudi Arabia , which is trying to
curb domestic fuel consumption, said it shortlisted 38 groups as
qualified initial bidders for an electric train project that
will link major parts of its capital city  Riyadh .  The city planners will soon invite the companies to submit
their bids for the 175-kilometer electrical rail link that will
connect its airport with other parts of the city, including the
new King Abdullah Financial Center,  ArRiyadh Development
Authority  said yesterday on its  website .  The Saudi Center for Energy Efficiency said on July 16 that
Saudi Arabia must enhance its public transportation network in
order to reduce the number of cars in the country and save more
of its fuel that it sells at subsidized prices.  The city planners also said they have received requests for
qualification from 146 companies for its public transportation
network project and they will soon select the initial qualified
bidders. The winner of this project will be responsible for
operating the buses and constructing bus stations and parking
spaces, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
