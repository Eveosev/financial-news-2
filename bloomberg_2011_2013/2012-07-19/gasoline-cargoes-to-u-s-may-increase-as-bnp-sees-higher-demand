Gasoline shipments across the
Atlantic Ocean from  Europe  may increase after inventories of the
auto fuel on the U.S. East Coast reached this year’s low.  Traders and oil companies booked 14 tankers to make the
voyage for the two weeks to Aug. 1 and 13 more are likely to be
hired, according to the median estimate in a survey yesterday of
six shipbrokers, traders and owners who specialize in shipping
gasoline. Demand for the fuel may be poised to strengthen,
according to BNP Paribas SA.  East Coast gasoline  inventories  slid to 52.2 million
barrels as of July 13, according to Department of Energy data.
That’s the smallest stockpile since November and the lowest
level for July for figures going back to the start of 1990. The
pump  price  of regular gasoline reached this year’s low of $3.326
a gallon on July 1, according to figures from the American
Automobile Association.  “U.S. gasoline inventories are far too low, which is
worrisome in a period of peak demand,” said  Harry Tchilinguirian , head of commodity-market strategy at BNP in
 London . “We still think there is upside to gasoline demand in
August and September.”  Tanker bookings and potential charters for the coming two
weeks would be the most since the two weeks from April 26, prior
surveys showed. U.S. gasoline demand tends to peak during the
so-called driving season from the end of May to early September.  Tanker Rates  “U.S. gasoline has to price higher to attract more imports
from Europe, so in a month or two, that’s a proposition that
would stabilize rates for refined oil products across the
Atlantic,” said Tchilinguirian.  Tankers hauling 37,000 metric-ton cargoes of gasoline
across the Atlantic are  losing  $17 daily, according to the
London-based Baltic Exchange. They were earning $1,672 a day at
the start of this month and $20,899 on Jan. 3, the exchange’s
data showed. The cargo size equates to 315,000 barrels.  Fifty vessels may be available to carry the fuel across the
Atlantic up to Aug. 1, five fewer than last week, according to
the survey. As many as 63 tankers, the most in at least a year,
were registered for the two weeks from July 5.  The 27 ships booked or likely to be chartered for the
journey, known as Medium-Range tankers, would be able to haul
about 8.49 million barrels of gasoline, or 607,000 barrels a
day, over the next two weeks. That’s 88 percent of the 686,000
barrels the U.S.  imported  daily over the past year, according to
the  Department of Energy .  The survey is based on so-called single-voyage, or spot,
charters and excludes loadings under longer-term contracts. It
assumes shipments to the U.S. East Coast from northwestern
Europe.  Following is a table of ships chartered and likely to be
hired for the trans-Atlantic voyage loading over the two-week
periods from the dates shown. The table also displays the number
of ships available to be booked.  *T                             July 18     July 11      Change
