First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM) , a
copper and nickel producer, gained the most in more than seven
months after Jefferies Group Inc. analysts named it a “top
pick” and said expansion plans may make it a takeover target.  First Quantum  rose  10 percent to C$18.27 in Toronto, the
biggest gain since Nov. 30. The Vancouver-based company is
raising capacity at its Kansanshi copper mine in  Zambia . It also
plans to develop the Sentinel mine in Zambia and build a copper
smelter at Kansanshi.  “The company has a significant, low-cost organic growth
pipeline, a strong balance sheet, high quality management and is
a potential acquisition target in the longer-term,” Jefferies
analysts  Christopher LaFemina  and Seth Rosenfeld said in a note
yesterday. They have a buy rating on First Quantum and said it’s
their top pick among copper producers trading in the U.K.  First Quantum “is at the beginning of a major growth phase
and could triple its copper production capacity over the next
5-6 years,” David Charles, an analyst at Dundee Securities
Corp. in Toronto, said in a note today. Charles initiated
coverage of the company with a buy recommendation and a price
target of C$26.50.  Outside of Africa, First Quantum restarted the Ravensthorpe
nickel mine in Western Australia in October, almost two years
after agreeing to buy the asset from  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  It’s
building a nickel and copper mine in  Finland  and is studying a
copper project in Peru.  To contact the reporter on this story:
