U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said a threatened strike by Border Agency employees that may
affect  Heathrow airport  and other entry points during the
Olympic Games wouldn’t be “justified.”  Cameron spoke today at a press conference in Kabul,
Afghanistan, following an announcement by the Public and
Commercial Services union that workers voted in favor of a
strike and other action over a dispute relating to job cuts,
pensions and pay. The union said it will announce action today.  “These issues have been bubbling under for a long time,
but the Olympics have really brought them into focus,” Richard
Simcox, a spokesman for the union, said in an interview. A
strike is “very likely,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
