strengthened for an eighth day against the central bank’s target

2010. The Russian currency rose as metals and oil, the nation’s
biggest export earners, surged on speculation policy makers from
 China  to the U.S. will act to boost their economies. Russia
depends on revenue from oil and gas for 50 percent of its 2011
budget, according to the government.  “The big picture for Russia is that  oil prices  remain high
and the government is spending money, which is broadly a
constructive backdrop for equities,” Lewis Kaufman, portfolio
manager of the Thornburg Developing World Fund who helps oversee
$7 billion in emerging market assets, said in a phone interview
from  Santa Fe ,  New Mexico  yesterday. A strong currency is
“going to affect consumption and to the extent that  consumer
confidence  remains high in Russia, Yandex is a way to
participate in that.”  Encourage Lending  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S.-traded fund

the first time in four days, increasing 0.7 percent to 30.03.  An increase in U.S. jobless claims and a decline in home

Federal Reserve will act to boost the world’s largest economy.
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told a Senate committee on July 17

shows.  Oil traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  rose to the

percent of its operating income in the first quarter from Russia
while VimpelCom  received  about 40 percent.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (NILSY) , world’s largest producer of nickel
