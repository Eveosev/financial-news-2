The naira depreciated for a second
day on concern accelerating inflation and declining foreign-
exchange reserves are weighing on the currency and as gasoline
importers increased dollar demand.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer retreated 0.3
percent to 161.7800 per dollar as of 12:07 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  inflation  rate rose to 12.9 percent in June from 12.7
percent in May, the Abuja-based National Bureau of Statistics
said yesterday.  The country’s foreign-currency reserves have
fallen by $1.3 billion since the end of May to $36.42 billion,
according to July 17 data compiled by the Abuja-based central
bank. Nigeria approved a tender on June 27 to import 3.135
million metric tons of gasoline in the third quarter, the
Petroleum Products Pricing and Regulatory Agency said.  “Traders want to increase their dollar position on
apprehension rising inflation and decline in reserves will cause
further depreciation of the naira,” Tunde Ladipo, chief
executive officer of Lagos-based Valuechain Investment Ltd.,
which trades currencies, said by phone today. “Besides, dollar
demand has risen after some oil importers got their official
permits last week.”  The yield on  Nigeria ’s 7-year domestic bonds due June 2019
rose 14 basis points to 16.26, according to the July 18 data on
the Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Yields on the
nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021 rose less than one
basis point to 5.4 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi appreciated 0.5 percent to 1.9420 per dollar
