Redecard SA (RDCD3) ,  Brazil ’s second-biggest
payments processor, rose in Sao Paulo trading after second-
quarter profit exceeded analysts’ estimates on cost cuts and
higher rental-equipment fees.  Redecard gained 0.9 percent to 33.30 reais today in Sao
Paulo trading as  Cielo SA (CIEL3) , Redecard’s bigger rival, advanced 1
percent to 62.65 reais.  Recurring net income at Barueri-based Redecard climbed 20
percent to 388.1 million reais ($193 million), or 58 centavos a
share, from 322.6 million reais, or 48 centavos, a year earlier,
the company said yesterday in a  statement . That beat the average
estimate of 56 centavos by 14 analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  “Redecard posted a better operating efficiency because of
lower expenses and a significant increase in the average
equipment-rental revenue of credit- and debit-card terminals,”
Nataniel Cezimbra and Carlos Daltozo, analysts at Banco do
Brasil SA, wrote in a report.  Chief Executive Officer Claudio Yamaguti, whose company may
be bought out by Sao Paulo-based  Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) , pared
operating expenses 13 percent from the second quarter of 2011,
led by a 28 percent reduction in personnel costs to 46.7 million
reais, according to the statement. Average rent on the company’s
terminals rose to 70.67 reais in the period, up 39 percent from
a year earlier and 5.7 percent from the first quarter.  Total credit- and debit-card volume climbed 6.5 percent to
59.3 billion reais from a year earlier, the company said.  Itau’s Offer  Itau offered 35 reais a share, or 11.8 billion reais, in
February to buy the 49 percent stake in Redecard it doesn’t
already own. NM Rothschild & Sons Ltd. appraised the offering
for minority stockholders, valuing each share at 34.18 reais to
37.59 reais, Redecard said in an April 5 regulatory filing.  Lazard Asset Management LLC, Redecard’s second-biggest
shareholder with a stake of about 10 percent as of Feb. 16,
asked for a new evaluation, saying Rothschild undervalued the
stock. Credit Suisse Group AG conducted a second appraisal and
valued the shares last month in line with Itau’s bid.  Itau reaffirmed its plan to buy Redecard after the second
appraisal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
