Emirates Nuclear Energy Corp. , the
state company developing nuclear  power plants  in the  United Arab
Emirates , has begun construction of the first facility and will
start the second in 2013.  Safety concrete for the first unit was poured yesterday at
the site in Barakah in Abu Dhabiâ€™s Western Region, Emirates
Nuclear said today in a statement. Emirates Nuclear will apply
for an operating license for the first unit in 2015 and will
pour concrete for the second unit in 2013, it said.  The first of the four 1,400 megawatt plants will be ready
in 2017, with each additional unit becoming operational every
year through 2020, according to the statement.  The U.A.E. is aiming to be the first Gulf Arab nation to
develop nuclear power.  Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEP)  was awarded
the contract to build the plants in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
