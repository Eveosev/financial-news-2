Select Comfort Corp. (SCSS) , the maker of
Sleep Number adjustable beds, advanced the most in more than a
year after raising its full-year profit forecast.  The shares gained 27 percent to $27.60 at the close in New
York, the biggest jump since April 21, 2011. Select Comfort,
based in Plymouth,  Minnesota , had risen less than 1 percent this
year through yesterday.  Select Comfort, which is looking to boost annual revenue by
38 percent to $1.5 billion in 2015, reported second-quarter
earnings and sales that topped analysts’ estimates. The company
plans to increase its number of stores by as much as 8 percent
this year to 412, according to a statement yesterday.  The company “saw no impact from competitor price
promotions and product introductions that have elevated concerns
on Select Comfort’s shares since early May,” Peter Keith, a New
York-based analyst for Piper Jaffray Cos., wrote in an investor
note today.  Keith, who rates the shares overweight, said the increase
in the annual profit forecast “now looks conservative.”  Full-year earnings per share will be $1.35 to $1.41, up
from a  prior  forecast of $1.32 to $1.40, the company said in the
statement. The average analyst estimate was $1.39, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Second-quarter  net income  rose 50 percent to $17 million,
or 30 cents a share, from $11.3 million, or 20 cents, a year
earlier. Analysts had estimated 27 cents.  Revenue increased 27 percent to $205 million from $161
million. The average estimate was $197.6 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
