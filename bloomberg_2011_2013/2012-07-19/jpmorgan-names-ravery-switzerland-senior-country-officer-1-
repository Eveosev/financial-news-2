JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest

investment banking and will also retain that role, the New York-
based company said in an e-mailed statement today.  “Switzerland is an increasingly important market within
our EMEA franchise, where we want to better serve a number of
global clients and broaden our coverage of regional companies
and institutions,” Emilio Saracho, head of Europe, Middle East
and Africa investment banking, said in the statement.  Ravery is a French national who has spent 30 years in
corporate finance and investment banking and joined JPMorgan in
1992. He started his career at  3i Group Plc (III)  in London in 1981
