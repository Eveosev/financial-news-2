China’s  national pension fund  said
it selected 12 global asset managers including  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM)  and  Schroders Plc (SDR)  for its overseas investments.  The National Council for Social Security Fund signed
investment management agreements with JPMorgan, Schroders,
Lombard Odier and  Neuberger Berman  for multiasset class products,
according to a  statement  yesterday on its website.  The national pension fund, which managed 869 billion  yuan 
($136 billion) as of Dec. 31, is allowed to invest as much as 20
percent of assets overseas through qualified managers, according
to its website. The fund’s total investment returns fell 77
percent last year after the country’s stock market tumbled as
economic growth slowed and the government tightened lending to
curb inflation, it said in March.  Emerging-market bond mandates were granted to companies
including Standish Mellon Asset Management, while AMP Capital
and AEW Capital Management LP are among managers that won
contracts for natural resources and real estate stocks,
according to the statement.  --Zhang Dingmin. Editors: Tomoko Yamazaki, Andreea Papuc  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
