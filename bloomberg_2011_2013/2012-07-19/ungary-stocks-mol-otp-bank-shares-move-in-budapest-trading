The benchmark  BUX (BUX)  index dropped 0.1
percent to 17,309.45 by the close in Budapest, the first decline
in five days.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Mol Nyrt. (MOL HB), Hungary’s largest refiner, rose for a
fourth day after its oil exploration partner Gulf Keystone
Petroleum Ltd. raised estimates for oil in Iraq’s Kurdistan
region. The shares advanced 0.7 percent to 16,920 forint.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)   Hungary’s largest lender, slid 0.6
percent to 3,451 forint. The aim of getting 50 percent of the
nation’s banking system into “Hungarian hands” is a key part
of the country’s new economic model, Prime Minister  Viktor Orban 
said today. The International Monetary Fund and the European
Union disagreed with the government’s growth forecast at the
start of aid talks, chief negotiator Mihaly Varga said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
