California  was sued by  San
Francisco ’s Chinatown Neighborhood Association over claims the
state’s ban on shark fin sales discriminates against people of
Chinese origin for whom the fins are a cultural tradition.  The group, whose members include people of Chinese ancestry
engaged in cultural practices using shark fins or businesses
that buy and sell the fins, filed a lawsuit yesterday in federal
court in San Francisco. The state’s shark fin ban violates U.S.
equal protection and interstate commerce laws and is overridden
by federal laws governing shark fin sales, the association said
in its complaint.  The association seeks a court order declaring the state ban
unconstitutional.  California’s shark fin sales ban, passed by the Legislature
last year, took effect in January and prohibits restaurants from
selling any newly acquired shark fins starting July 1, 2013.  Shum Preston, a spokesman for California Attorney General
 Kamala Harris , declined to immediately comment on the lawsuit.  Yesterday, five Chinese business leaders appeared in
advertisements for the group WildAid in which they pledged not
to eat shark fins, which are often served at business dinners,
according to a statement.  The case is Chinatown Neighborhood Association v. Brown,
12-03759, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
