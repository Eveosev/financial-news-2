French five- and 10-year bond yields
dropped to record lows before the nation sells securities
maturing between 2015 and 2017 at an auction.  The nationâ€™s ten-year rate dropped as much as six basis
points to 2.037 percent as of 9:38 a.m. London time, the lowest
since Bloomberg began tracking the data in 1990. French five-
year yields fell as much as seven basis points to an all-time
low of 0.731 percent.  Austrian 10-year bond yields fell to as low as 1.83
percent, and the rate on similar-maturity Belgian bonds dropped
to 2.438 percent, both the lowest on record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
