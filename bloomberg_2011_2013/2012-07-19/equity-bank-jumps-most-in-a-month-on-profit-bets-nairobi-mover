     July 19 (Bloomberg) -- Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK) ,  Kenya ’s largest
lender by customers, rose for a second day, headed for the
highest in almost a month on speculation of increased first-half
earnings.  The stock climbed as much as 2.3 percent to 22.25 shillings
and traded at 22 shillings as of 1:21 p.m. in Nairobi. A close
at that level would be the highest since June 22.  First-quarter profit climbed 13 percent to 2.64 billion
shillings ($31.4 million) as loans surged, Managing Director
James Mwangi said April 26. The lender’s price estimate was
increased to 27.9 shillings from 25.5 shillings,  Renaissance
Capital  said in an e-mailed report on July 16.  “Based on what they did for first quarter, the bottom line
is likely to increase by 15 percent to 20 percent generally
because the interest expenses came down in the second quarter,”
Faith Atiti, an analyst at Nairobi-based Sterling Investment
Bank said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
