Japanese  stocks  rose, with the Topix
Index snapping a nine-day losing streak, after U.S. housing
starts jumped to the highest in almost four years, boosting the
outlook for exporters.  Machinery maker  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , which depends on the Americas
for 23 percent of its sales, gained 3.3 percent. Advantest Corp.,
the world’s top producer of memory-chip testers, surged 6.5
percent after industry bellwether  Intel Corp . topped profit
estimates. Yaskawa Electric Co. jumped 8.4 percent after the
factory robotics maker beat earnings expectations.  The Topix gained 0.9 percent to 747.13 at the 3 p.m.
trading break in Tokyo after yesterday capping the longest
losing streak since July 2009. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) 
added 0.8 percent to 8,795.55, with about three shares rising
for each that fell. Shares also gained on speculation China will
do more to boost growth.  “The  U.S. economy  has gone through a bit of soft patch,
but the housing sector does seem to be heading for recovery,
which is positive from a longer-term perspective for America,”
said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of investment strategy at
AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has almost $100 billion under
management. “The market still likes what it sees.”  The Topix rebounded 7.4 percent from a 29-year low reached
on June 4 as concern eased about Europe’s debt crisis and
central banks around the world cut rates to shore up growth.
China has “relatively large” room to support economic
expansion, Zhang Peng, a Beijing-based researcher at the
Ministry of Finance, said yesterday.  Shares on the index are  valued  at 0.9 times book value,
compared with 2.2 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.4
for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number below one means
investors can buy companies for less than the value of their
assets.  U.S. Housing  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  rose 0.3 percent today. The equity
gauge advanced 0.7 percent in New York yesterday after the
Commerce Department reported that U.S. housing starts jumped 6.9
percent last month to the highest since October 2008.  The  Federal Reserve  said in a survey based on reports from
its 12 district banks that the economy expanded at a “modest to
moderate” pace in June and early July. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke yesterday told Congress that the central bank can limit
inflation while providing record stimulus to bolster a flagging
recovery marked by high unemployment.  Companies that do business in the U.S. advanced. Komatsu
rose 3.3 percent to 1,744 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s top exporter
of consumer electronics, rose 1.6 percent to 980 yen.  Chip-related companies climbed after Intel reported second-
quarter profit of 54 cents a share, exceeding the average
analyst estimate by 2 cents. Advantest added 6.5 percent to
1,125 yen, while  Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723)  jumped 7.4 percent to
260 yen.  Yaskawa Electric  Yaskawa Electric advanced the most on the Nikkei 225,
jumping 8.4 percent to 569 yen. The stock rose after operating

three months ended June 20 from a year earlier, beating
Citigroup Inc.’s estimate for a 1.2 billion yen gain.  Yokogawa Electric Corp. (6841) , a manufacturer of control
equipment, gained 2.6 percent to 798 yen on expectations first-
quarter operating profit will rise to 3 billion yen, according
to a Nikkei newspaper report. The company is scheduled to report

increase for households, according to  Kyodo News . The utility’s
stock on July 17 fell to its lowest level since at least 1974 on
renewed concerns about nuclear safety.  Hokuriku Electric Power Co. rose 0.7 percent to 883 yen,
and  Kansai Electric  added 1.1 percent to 750 yen. The utilities
plunged yesterday on a Nikkei report that regulators will ask
them to conduct geological studies after surveys showed that a
fault under a Hokuriku Electric nuclear plant is probably active.  All Nippon Airways Co. fell 2.1 percent to 188 yen, its
