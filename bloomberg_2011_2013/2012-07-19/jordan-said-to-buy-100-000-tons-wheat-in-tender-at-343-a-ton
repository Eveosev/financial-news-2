Jordan bought 100,000 metric tons of
wheat today from Ukraine’s Nibulon at $343 a ton, according to
two traders with direct knowledge of the tender.  The two 50,000-ton cargoes are for delivery in the second
half of August and first half of September, said the traders,
who declined to be identified because they aren’t authorized to
speak to the media.  To contact the reporter on this story:
