Brazil  auctioned 7.3 billion reais
($3.6 billion) of fixed-rate and zero-coupon securities today,
compared with last week’s 6 billion reais of zero-coupon debt,
according to data compiled by the Treasury.  “There was strong demand,” Ricardo Tibau, a government
bond trader at Renascenca Dtvm Ltda., said by phone from Sao
Paulo. “The auctions were well-received.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
