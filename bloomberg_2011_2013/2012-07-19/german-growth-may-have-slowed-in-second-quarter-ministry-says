The German economy probably slowed
in the second quarter as industrial production weakened, the
 Finance Ministry  said.  Even so, tax revenue rose 7.5 percent in June from a year
earlier, led by intake at federal level, while six-month revenue
increased 4.4 percent from the same year-earlier period, the
Berlin-based ministry said in its monthly report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
