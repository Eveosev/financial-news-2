market has been firm and housing data was a bit stronger than
expected, maybe its shows a relatively stable growth environment
in the U.S. Markets are relieved and maybe we’ll see short
covers coming in.”  The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 9.8 percent from this
year’s high in February through today on signs Europe’s debt
