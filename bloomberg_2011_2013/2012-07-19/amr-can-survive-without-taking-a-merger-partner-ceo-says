Chief Executive Officer  Tom Horton 
said American Airlines doesn’t need a merger to thrive after
bankruptcy, even with US Airways Group Inc., which has said a
combination is vital to the larger carrier’s survival.  American “has great assets,” Horton said in a Bloomberg
Television interview. “We have the best partners around the
world and we have got a pipeline of industry-leading products
and services” that include 550 new airplanes on order.  American parent  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ)  hopes to complete a review of
strategic options by the fall, Horton said in a separate
interview today. The company has begun considering options now
that it has cost and revenue projections for a stand-alone plan.  US Airways, the most vocal suitor, said yesterday it won’t
wait indefinitely for a merger agreement. Chief Executive
Officer Doug Parker has argued a combination with  US Airways  is
the only way for American to resolve route-network weaknesses
after consolidation in the industry left it a distant No. 3
behind  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  and Delta Air Lines Inc.  US Airways was one of five carriers Horton mentioned as
potential partners in a meeting with AMR’s creditors committee
June 10, people familiar with the matter have said. The others
were Alaska Airlines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue Airways Corp.
and Virgin America Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
