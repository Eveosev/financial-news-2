New Zealand  named former  Reserve
Bank  deputy governor Rod Carr to the central bank’s board 10
years after he quit the No. 2 executive position.  “Carr has extensive experience, both in the banking
industry and as a director,” Finance Minister  Bill English  said
in an e-mailed statement announcing the appointment. Carr is
currently vice-chancellor of University of Canterbury, and was
previously chief executive officer at Jade Software Corp.  Carr was deputy governor from 1998 and served as acting
governor for a five-month period in 2002 when Don Brash quit to
enter politics. Carr, who worked in the banking industry before
joining the RBNZ, was a contender for the top job, which went to
Alan Bollard. Carr left to join Jade in July 2003.  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s board, which doesn’t have
a role in monetary policy decisions, is responsible for
monitoring the performance of the bank and the governor,
according to the annual report. Last month, the board selected
Graeme Wheeler, a former World Bank official who previously
served in the nation’s Treasury department, to replace Bollard
starting in late September.  Carr replaces Hugh Fletcher, who was deputy chairman. In
March, the government reappointed Arthur Grimes as chairman
until 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
