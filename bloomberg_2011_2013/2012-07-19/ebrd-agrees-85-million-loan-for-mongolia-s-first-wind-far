The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development and the Netherlands Development Finance Company
agreed an $85 million loan for Mongolia’s first wind farm.  The 50-megawatt Salkhit wind farm will be built southeast
of the Mongolian capital Ulaanbaatar and it’s expected to start
working later this year, according to an e-mailed statement
today from Norton Rose LLP that advised on the financing. It’s
expected to supply 5 percent of the country’s electricity.  The project is being developed by Newcom LLC and General
Electric Co. is providing the turbines. Newcom, an investment
firm whose portfolio includes telecommunications,  information
technology , airlines and financial services, is venturing into
wind power as part of the government’s plan to raise the amount
of energy from clean sources to as much as 25 percent by 2020.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
