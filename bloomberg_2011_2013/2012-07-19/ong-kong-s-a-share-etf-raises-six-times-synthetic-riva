Demand for the first Hong Kong
exchange-traded fund backed by stocks listed in mainland  China 
pushed the security’s market value to six times that of a
similar ETF that uses derivatives.  The  China AMC CSI 300 Index ETF (83188)  has 3.8 billion  yuan  ($596
million) in assets after listing on July 17, compared with
HK$838 million for the  iShares CSI 300 A-Share Index fund , which
started in November 2009. The physical ETF’s market value is
capped by mainland regulators at 5 billion yuan.  The security is the first to give investors who don’t have
special permission to invest in the Chinese companies access to
returns that are backed strictly by gains and losses in mainland
shares. It acquires the stock through the  Renminbi  Qualified
Foreign Institutional Investor quota granted by mainland
authorities. The 24 other A-share ETFs listed on the exchange
trade in Hong Kong dollars and use derivatives to replicate the
indexes, according to a July 16 statement from  Hong Kong
Exchanges (388)  & Clearing Ltd.  “Investors welcome this genuine Asian ETF, because it’s
backed by physical shares,” said  Ben Kwong , chief operating
officer at KGI Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. “The synthetic shares
had been popular before, because there was no substitute. It
provides a good vehicle to invest.”  More than  4.7 million units  of the RQFII fund changed hands
yesterday, 33 times as many the synthetic iShares ETF. The China
AMC fund rose 0.4 percent to 24.3 yuan yesterday while the
synthetic security gained 0.5 percent to HK$21.50. The  CSI 300
benchmark (SHSZ300)  index that underlies both gained 0.01 percent to
2,414.33.  Investor Warnings  Counterparty risk associated with derivatives in a
synthetic ETF should be absent in the new product. It carries
its own type of risk given the untested nature and the fact that
mainland regulators may step in or revise guidelines, the Hong
Kong Securities and Futures Commission said on its website.  Three more physically backed A-share ETFs will be approved
by the SFC, Ming Pao Daily reported July 16, citing Alexa Lam,
deputy chief executive officer of the SFC. E Fund Management
Co., CSOP Asset Management Ltd. and Harvest Global Investments
will create yuan-denominated funds with a 5 billion yuan ($784
million) quota each, the paper reported.  The new funds are part of a push by China to open its
 capital markets  and by Hong Kong to cement its position as the
bridge to the mainland. The China Securities Regulatory
Commission approved the first two Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed
ETFs tracking Hong Kong indexes on June 30. The Hong Kong bourse
began listing yuan-denominated IPOs in 2011 and this year cut
its lunch break to more closely align with China’s trading day.  Hong Kong Exchanges has bid 1.39 billion pounds ($2.16
billion) for London Metal Exchange, the world’s biggest
commodities market. It says it will increase the commodity
bourse’s revenue in part by tapping the large potential base of
customers in China, which accounts for about 40 percent of
consumption of commodities globally and only as much as 25
percent of trading on the LME, the company said when announcing
the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
