Italy ’s limits on the powers of its
telecommunications agency may violate European Union rules, the
European Commission said.  An amendment to an Italian law that aims to separate the
provision of access to  Telecom Italia SpA’s (TIT)  wholesale network
from the activation and maintenance of lines may contravene EU
rules, the EU’s executive arm said in a statement today.  “The law in question would prescribe one solution and thus
pre-empt the discretion” of the Italian telecoms regulator
 AGCOM , the commission said. “AGCOM should be able to address
any potential competition issue independently.”  The EU said it started legal action against Italy today by
sending a so-called letter of formal notice. Italy has two
months to respond. The EU can ask the EU courts to impose fines
on a country that isn’t complying with the law of the 27-nation
bloc.  Italy sought to boost competition in the telecommunications
market with rules to open up network access and services,
including maintenance.  Telecom Italia fell as much as 6 cents, or 8.1 percent, to
68.4 cents and traded 7.7 percent lower as of 5:02 p.m. in
Milan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
