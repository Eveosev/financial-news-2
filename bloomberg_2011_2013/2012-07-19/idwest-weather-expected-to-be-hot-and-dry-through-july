The Midwest will probably remain dry
through the end of the month and the heat that has been wilting
crops may persist until September.  Temperatures in the Great Plains and Midwest are expected
to remain 5 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit above normal (2.8 to 3.9
Celsius) through the end of July, according to  MDA EarthSat
Weather  in Gaithersburg,  Maryland .  The company’s 30- to 60-day outlook calls for above-normal
temperatures to grip the center of the U.S. through September.  “The pattern is driven by persistence, with the heat of
the first two months of summer continuing into August,” MDA’s
forecast showed.  Hot, dry conditions in the Midwest have left corn and
soybean fields in the worst shape since 1988 as the most severe
U.S. drought since 1956 continues. Soybeans reached a record
high $16.5125 a bushel today on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
surpassing the previous peak of $16.3675 on July 3, 2008.  Soybeans for November delivery rose 1.7 percent to $16.48 a
bushel by 7 a.m. on the CBOT. The oilseed jumped 36 percent this
year as U.S. harvest concerns followed a drought that slashed
the past season’s production in Brazil and  Argentina .  Corn for December delivery rallied 1.3 percent to $7.945 a
bushel after touching $7.98. The record for a most-active
contract is $7.9925. Corn has surged 57 percent since mid-June.
Futures for September delivery, the contract closest to
expiration, rose as high as $8.115 today.  The area from Nebraska and Iowa south to Texas and
Louisiana is expected to have less than normal rainfall through
July 28, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,
Maryland.  The rainfall deficit may continue for Iowa, Illinois and
Indiana through Aug. 2, according to Commodity Weather.  -With assistance from  Jeff Wilson  in Chicago and Whitney
