The following is the text of
Canada’s employment insurance report for May released
by  Statistics Canada .  The number of people receiving regular Employment Insurance
(EI) benefits totalled 512,600 in May, virtually unchanged from
April. This followed three months of consecutive declines. The
number of beneficiaries decreased slightly in  Alberta , while it
edged up in  New Brunswick .  Claims decrease in May  To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a
claim. The number of claims provides an indication of the number
of people who could become beneficiaries.  In May, the number of initial and renewal claims fell 4.2%
to 223,800. Claims fell in every province, with the largest
percentage declines in Saskatchewan (-11.0%), New Brunswick (‑
8.3%) and Manitoba (-6.6%).  Little or no change in most provinces  There was little or no change in beneficiaries in most
provinces in May.  In Alberta, the number of people receiving regular EI
benefits decreased 2.3% to 24,000, continuing a downward trend
that began in January 2012.  In Ontario, the number of beneficiaries edged down 0.9% to
148,200 in May, following a substantial decline in April.  There were small increases in New Brunswick (+2.1%) and
Prince  Edward Island  (+1.5%). In  Quebec , the number of
beneficiaries edged up 0.5%, following three consecutive monthly
declines.  Year-over-year declines in most large urban centres  Large urban centres are those with a population of 10,000
or more. EI data at the sub-provincial level are not seasonally
adjusted and are therefore compared on a year-over-year basis.  Between May 2011 and May 2012, the number of people
receiving regular EI benefits fell 13.6% to 468,100. Declines
occurred in 124 of 143 large centres.  In Newfoundland and Labrador, the number of beneficiaries
declined in four of five large centres. The largest decrease
occurred in  St. John’s , where the number fell 19.4% to 3,400.  In Prince Edward Island, the number of beneficiaries fell
23.5% to 1,800 in Charlottetown, while it was little changed in
Summerside.  In  Nova Scotia , four of five large centres had fewer
beneficiaries in the 12 months to May. The largest percentage
declines occurred in Truro, Kentville and Halifax. In Halifax,
beneficiaries fell 13.6% to 4,600.  The number of beneficiaries fell in four of the six large
centres in New Brunswick. In Fredericton, it declined 10.2% to
1,200, the third monthly drop in a row. In Saint John, the
number decreased 4.6% to 2,300.  In Quebec, year-over-year declines occurred in 28 of the 33
large centres in May. The largest percentage decreases occurred
in Rouyn-Noranda, Val-d’Or, Rivière-du-Loup and Amos. The number
of beneficiaries in the census metropolitan area of Québec fell
12.0%. In Montréal, it declined 11.5% to 46,300.  Of the 41 large centres in Ontario, 37 had fewer
beneficiaries in the 12 months to May. The largest percentage
decreases occurred in Stratford, Woodstock, Chatham-Kent,
Collingwood and Windsor. In Toronto, there were 19.2% fewer
people receiving EI benefits in May. The rate of decline in the
number of beneficiaries in Toronto has been around 20% since
June 2010.  In Manitoba, the number of beneficiaries fell in three of
the four large centres. In Winnipeg, it was down 4.8% to 5,000.  In Saskatchewan, all eight large centres continued to post
year-over-year declines, the largest occurring in Regina, where
the number of beneficiaries fell 18.8% to 780.  In Alberta, all 12 large centres had fewer beneficiaries in
the 12 months to May. The largest percentage declines occurred
in Lethbridge,  Grand Prairie  and  Edmonton . In Edmonton, the
number of people receiving EI benefits dropped 37.8% to 6,300,
and in Calgary, it fell 34.2% to 6,700. Other large centres with
year-over-year declines of 30% or more were Cold Lake, Red Deer

in 22 of the 25 large centres, with the largest declines in
Squamish, Penticton and Vernon. In  Vancouver , 21,100 people
received benefits in May, down 19.7% from 12 months earlier. In
Victoria, the number was down 19.0% to 2,600.  Demographic groups  EI data by sex and age are not seasonally adjusted and are
therefore compared on a year-over-year basis.  In May, 288,500 men received regular benefits, down 14.2%
from May 2011. The number of beneficiaries fell at a similar
rate for men under 25 (-14.6%) and for men aged 25 to 54 (-
14.7%). Among men aged 55 and over, the number fell 12.3%.  In May, 179,500 women received regular benefits, down 12.7%
from 12 months earlier. Among women, the number of beneficiaries
decreased 14.5% for those under 25, and 13.3% for those aged 25
to 54. The number of beneficiaries among women aged 55 and over
fell 10.1%.  Note to readers  The change in the number of regular Employment Insurance
(EI) beneficiaries reflects various situations, including people
becoming beneficiaries, people going back to work, and people
exhausting their regular benefits.  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted unless
otherwise specified.  EI statistics are produced from administrative data sources
provided by Service  Canada  and Human Resources and Skills
Development Canada. These statistics may, from time to time, be
affected by changes to the Employment Insurance Act or
administrative procedures. The number of regular beneficiaries
and the number of claims received for April and May are
preliminary. In this release, large urban centres correspond to
those with a population of 10,000 or more.  The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all people who
received EI benefits from May 13 to 19. This period coincides
with the reference week of the Labour Force Survey (LFS).  EI statistics indicate the number of people who received EI
benefits, and should not be confused with data coming from the
LFS, which provides information on the total number of
unemployed people.  There is always a certain proportion of unemployed people
who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed people have not
contributed to the program because they have not worked in the
past 12 months or their employment is not insured. Other
unemployed people have contributed to the program but do not
meet the eligibility criteria, such as workers who left their
job voluntarily or those who did not accumulate enough hours of
work to receive benefits.
