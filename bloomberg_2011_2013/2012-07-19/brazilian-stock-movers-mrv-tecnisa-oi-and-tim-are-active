The following companies are having
 unusual  price changes in  Sao Paulo  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of 1:56 p.m. local time.
Preferred shares are usually the most-traded class of stock.  The  Bovespa (IBOV)  Index gained 1.4 percent to 55,329.86.  MRV Engenharia (MRVE3)  & Participacoes SA (MRVE3 BZ), Brazil’s
second-biggest homebuilder by market capitalization, rose 3.5
percent to 10.93 reais. A close at that level would be the
highest since May 14. The company said yesterday in a regulatory
filing after the market closed that contracted sales slid 3
percent in the second quarter. The decline was smaller than
those of its competitors.  Tecnisa SA (TCSA3)  (TCSA3 BZ), Brazil’s eighth-largest homebuilder
by market capitalization, fell 1.9 percent to 6.77 reais, the
biggest decline on the BM&FBovespa Real Estate index. The
company’s second-quarter contracted sales fell 57 percent to
235.7 million reais, according to a regulatory filing yesterday,
trailing the 348.6 million reais average estimate of five
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Tim Participacoes SA (TIMP3)  (TIMP3 BZ), Brazil’s second-biggest
mobile-phone operator, slumped 8.6 percent to 8.65 reais. A

failures. Oi gained 4.4 percent to 9.57 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
