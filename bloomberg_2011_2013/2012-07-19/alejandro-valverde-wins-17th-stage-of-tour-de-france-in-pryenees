Alejandro Valverde of the Movistar
team won the 17th stage of the  Tour de France  in the Pyrenees
mountains as Bradley Wiggins retained the yellow jersey in his
quest to become the first British rider to win the race.  The Spaniard won the 143.5-kilometer (89-mile) stage
between Bagneres-de-Luchon and Peyragudes. Second-placed Chris
Froome was 19 seconds back, followed immediately by Wiggins.  “That was an incredible feeling crossing the line on the
last mountain because that’s where everyone said I was at my
weakest,” Wiggins said. “There were almost tears in my eyes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
