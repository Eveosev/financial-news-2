Chikako Sekine, corporate officer in
charge of beauty consultants at  Shiseido Co. (4911) , comments on the
company’s plan to eventually use more than a thousand  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
iPads to its counselors to help sell cosmetics.  Sekine spoke in an interview on July 18 in Tokyo.  On where the iPad’s will be used:  “We will do an experimental introduction of 100 iPads in
Europe and 50 in  Asia  from August. And we plan to introduce them
worldwide outside of Japan from April 2013.”  On how the devices will be used:  “IPads allow customers to visually see a change through
movies, such as differences in skin color. There are other
makers that have introduced iPads. However, they are often just
for showing movies or self-counseling. This will probably be the
first time beauty consultants use iPads as an assistant tool for
counseling.”  On the expected benefits:  “It will improve the levels of beauty consultants.
Overseas business has a relatively higher turnover rate than
domestic. If there is a high turnover rate, there will be a
difference in services even if given education. IPads will
average out the levels of beauty consultants as well as produce
a cost merit by becoming more paperless”  To contact the reporter on this story:
