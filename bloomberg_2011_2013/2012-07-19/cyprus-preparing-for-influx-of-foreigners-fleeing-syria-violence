Cyprus is preparing to assist with
the evacuation of as many as 200,000 European Union and third-
country nationals in  Syria  if violence in the country escalates,
the government said.  “We have plans to enable the evacuation not only from
Syria but also other countries in the area,” Foreign Minister
Erato Kozakou-Markoulli told reporters in Nicosia today. People
fleeing the upheaval will reach Cyprus “by plane or by boat and
will remain in Cyprus 48 hours before they are transported to
their country”.  The plan is similar to the one applied in 2006, when 65,000
citizens from the EU and other countries fled Lebanon for Cyprus
during the war with  Israel , Kazakou-Markoulli said.  She added that the position of Cyprus, which assumed the
EU’s rotating presidency on July 1, with respect to the
transition of power in Syria, is that Syrian President Bashar
al-Assad should resign.  “Bashar has to go,” she said, adding that the island is
opposed to any military intervention in Syria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
