Romania ’s hydropower generator
Hidroelectrica SA lost as much as 1.3 billion euros from 2006
until May 31, 2012 because of bilateral contracts on supply of
power at below-market prices, the President’s office said today
in a statement on its website.  Hidroelectrica is currently holding talks with several
companies and may renounce bilateral contracts from July 16 to
July 22, after terminating one such contract, the Bucharest-
based office said in the statement based on information received
from the country’s Economy Ministry today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
