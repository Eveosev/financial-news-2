Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste SAB ,
the operator of airports in southern  Mexico  including Cancun,
surged to a record after a unit it co-owns won a bid to operate
an airport in Puerto Rico.  Asur, as the company is known, climbed 7.2 percent to
112.17 pesos at 12:23 p.m. in Mexico City, the most on a closing
basis since July 2009. Shares touched 113.08 pesos, a record
intraday high. It was the best performer on the benchmark  IPC
index (MEXBOL)  of 35 Mexican companies, which slipped 0.5 percent.  Aerostar Airport Holdings, owned by Mexico City-based Asur
and a private equity fund known as Highstar Capital IV, will
enter into a 40-year lease of Luis Munoz Marin International
Airport in San Juan, according to a statement distributed by PR
Newswire. Aerostar will pay the  Puerto Rico  Ports Authority an
upfront fee of $615 million.  Asur has gained 43 percent this year, the third-best
performance on the IPC index after Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB
and Alfa SAB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
