Hungarian gross  wages  rose in May at
twice the rate economists forecast as salary growth at private
companies accelerated.  The average monthly gross wage rose 6.4 percent from a year
earlier to 225,687 forint ($974), the statistics office in
Budapest said in a statement today. The median estimate of seven
economists in a Bloomberg survey was 3.2 percent.  Wage growth at private companies accelerated to 9.4 percent
in May, the fastest this year, from 6.5 percent in April, while
salaries for public employees dropped 0.6 percent in May after
falling 7.3 percent in the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
