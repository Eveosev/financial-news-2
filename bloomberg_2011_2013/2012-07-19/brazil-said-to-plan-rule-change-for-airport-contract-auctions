Brazil is considering changing the
way airport licenses are awarded ahead of the 2014  World Cup  and
2016  Olympic Games , which will boost tourism in the world’s
second-largest emerging market, according to a state official
familiar with the plan.  President  Dilma Rousseff  may allow construction companies
to participate in auctions alone rather than requiring builders
to team up with airport operators to bid as a group, said the
official, who asked not to be named because the plan isn’t yet
public.  Under this model, which is one of several proposals being
considered, the operator would be chosen by the construction
company after the building contracts are awarded, the official
said. The change would ensure that operators with more
experience would be hired to run airports.  Brazil’s government is seeking to auction the licenses to
expand, modernize and build new runways at Galeao airport in  Rio
de Janeiro , Confins in Minas Gerais state and Salvador airport
in Bahia state. The new rules will be announced this year in a
bid to accelerate infrastructure investments to stimulate growth
in 2013, said the official.  The press office at the presidential palace declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
