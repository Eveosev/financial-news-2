Hiroki Kuroda pitched seven shutout
innings and  Mark Teixeira  hit a two-run home run as the  New York
Yankees  beat the Toronto Blue Jays 6-0 in a rain-shortened
contest to complete a sweep of their three-game series.  Teixeira’s 19th home run of the season gave New York a 3-0
first-inning lead yesterday at Yankee Stadium, where the game
was delayed an hour and 49 minutes and later halted after seven
innings because of rain.  The Yankees have scored at least three runs in 42 straight
games, the longest streak in Major League Baseball since the
1994 Cleveland Indians did it in 48 consecutive games.  The Yankees have won nine of their past 11 games and
improved their MLB-best record to 57-34.  The New York Mets fell to the Washington Nationals 4-3 as
their season-high losing skid hit six games.  Jordan Zimmerman pitched six scoreless innings yesterday
and Adam LaRoche hit a two-run homer for the Nationals, who have
the best record in the National League at 53-36.  The Boston Red Sox beat the Chicago White Sox 10-1 behind a
pair of three-run homers by  Cody Ross , while the Los Angeles
Dodgers defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 5-3 on  Matt Kemp ’s
two-run home run in the bottom of the 12th inning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
