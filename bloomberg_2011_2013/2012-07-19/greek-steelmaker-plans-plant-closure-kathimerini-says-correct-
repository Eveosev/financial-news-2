(Corrects name of company in first paragraph.)  Greece ’s Hellenic Halyvourgia SA, a
steel manufacturer and supplier, plans to shut down its plant in
the western Athens suburb of Aspropyrgos after failing to
resolve an industrial dispute with workers,  Kathimerini 
reported, without saying how it got the information.  The company’s management will issue an order by tomorrow
afternoon to suspend the plant’s operations and fire 240 workers
after talks with Greece’s labor minister failed to end a nine-
month strike, the Athens-based newspaper said. The workers were
opposing pay cuts and some job losses, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
