U.S. municipal-bond yields fell to
the lowest since at least January 2009, when Bloomberg began
compiling data on the benchmark, amid a four-month rally fueled
by investors seeking a haven from  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The  yield  on top-rated, tax-exempt bonds due in 10 years
dropped about 0.01 percentage point to 1.728 percent at 4 p.m.
in  New York , according to a Bloomberg Valuation Index. The
 interest rate  reached a previous low of 1.737 percent on Feb. 2.
Yields move inversely to bond prices.  With Treasuries leading the fixed-income rally, the 10-year
benchmark muni yields are about 115 percent of those on federal
debt with the same maturity, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The  ratio , a gauge of relative value between the two asset
classes, has been above 100 percent since mid-May, the longest
streak since 2009, enhancing the appeal of munis.  “Muni yields still represent value as they’re above
taxable yields across the curve,” said David Manges, municipal
trading manager at BNY Mellon Capital Markets LLC in Pittsburgh.
“We’re captive to where Treasury rates go, and we’re captive to
our own supply and demand dynamic.”  Mutual funds that invest in municipal debt have added $16.3
billion this year, the biggest influx since 2009, according to
Lipper US Fund Flows data. Demand has persisted even with three
 California  localities opting to seek  bankruptcy protection .  The benchmark 10-year yield has declined for nine straight
days, the longest streak since April. The interest rate has
fallen 0.19 percentage point since June 28, when Stockton,
California, became the biggest U.S. city to file for Chapter 9
bankruptcy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
