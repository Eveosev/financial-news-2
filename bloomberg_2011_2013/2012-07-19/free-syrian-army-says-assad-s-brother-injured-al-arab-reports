Maher al-Assad, the younger brother
of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, was injured in the Damascus
explosion that killed key officials yesterday,  Al Arab  reported,
citing the head of the Supreme Council of the Free Syrian Army.  Brigadier General Mustafa al-Sheikh said he had prior
information about the bomb attack that took place a day earlier
than scheduled because of some unexpected circumstances which he
did not explain, the Doha, Qatar-based newspaper reported.  The explosion, the most serious attack on officials since
the uprising started in March 2011, killed Assad’s brother-in-
law, his defense minister and the vice president’s military
adviser at  Syria ’s national security headquarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
