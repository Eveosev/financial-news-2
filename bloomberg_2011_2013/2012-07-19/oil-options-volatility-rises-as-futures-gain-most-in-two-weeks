Oil options volatility rose for the
first time in three days as underlying futures gained the most
in two weeks on concern that Middle East tensions will disrupt
oil supplies.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 34.2 percent at 3:45 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , up from 32.1 yesterday.  Crude oil for September delivery rose $2.80 to $92.66 a
barrel on the Nymex, while the front-month August contract
gained $2.79 to $92.66. Prices have climbed 10 percent in seven
sessions, the longest streak of advances since Feb. 24.  Futures gained as Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu 
said Lebanon’s Iranian-backed Hezbollah organization carried out
the attack that killed at least five Israeli tourists in
 Bulgaria . Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman  Ramin Mehmanparast 
accused  Israel  of “delusive” accusations.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
September $105 calls, which rose 20 cents to 50 cents a barrel
at 3:48 p.m. with 4,455 lots trading. September $100 calls were
the second-most active options, with 3,738 lots changing hands
as they advanced 49 cents to $1.11 a barrel.  Calls accounted for 55 percent of total electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bullish bets accounted for 58 percent of the 109,213
contracts traded in the previous session.  September $115 calls were the most actively traded
yesterday, with 5,799 lots changing hands. They fell 1 cent to
12 cents a barrel. The next-most active options, December $120
calls were unchanged at 57 cents on volume of 4,881.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 43,145
contracts. Next were December $120 calls with 39,719 lots and
December $100 calls with 38,862.  To contact the reporter on this story:
