Hungary’s government should uphold
the rule of law by stopping its practice of bypassing and
preempting Constitutional Court rulings, the court’s chief
justice said.  The country’s highest court ruled on July 16 that Prime
Minister  Viktor Orban ’s Cabinet forcing judges to retire by
lowering their pension age to 62 from 70 was unconstitutional.
Hungary needs to create coherence between its constitution and
laws governing the judiciary and pensions, Orban said on the
same day, adding that “the system is to remain.”  “It’s been happening recently that the government tried to
run a race to preempt Constitutional Court decisions or to
bypass the contents of our rulings with various methods,” Chief
Justice Peter Paczolay said on state-run MR1 radio today. “In
the current case, lawmakers must implement our actual judgment
as well as its spirit and intentions. That is one of the main
criteria of the rule of law.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
