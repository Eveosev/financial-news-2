Reports of losses in the value of
the Syrian pound are “exaggerated and untrue” and intended to
provoke panic among Syrians, Central Bank Governor Adib Mayaleh
said, according to state-run Sana news agency.  Mayaleh said the pound stands at 68.30 to the dollar and
those who violate the exchange bulletin or regulations are
“partners in the conspiracy hatched against  Syria  and they will
be punished according to the law,” Sana said.  Al Arabiya television said in a report today that the
Syrian pound has lost 10 percent of its value and is heading
toward collapse after yesterday’s bombing in Damascus that
killed three of the country’s top military leaders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
