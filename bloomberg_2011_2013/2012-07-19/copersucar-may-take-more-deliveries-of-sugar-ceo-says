Copersucar SA, the world’s second-
largest sugar-trading company, may take more deliveries of raw
sugar against ICE Futures contracts if logistic delays persist,
Chief Executive Officer Paulo Roberto de Souza said.  “We may do it again in case port bottlenecks in  Brazil 
continue to delay the flow of sugar to our clients,” Souza told
reporters yesterday in  Sao Paulo . “It is a way to source supply
outside Brazil and meet our commitments with clients on time.”  Copersucar, based in Sao Paulo, took delivery of 112,578
tons of sugar against the contract that expired June 29, Souza
said.  Minneapolis-based Cargill Inc., America’s largest closely
held company, is the world’s largest sugar-trading company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
