Taiwan ’s overnight rate dropped for
the sixth day, the longest decline since May 2009, on
speculation the central bank will cut borrowing costs to help
reverse slowing economic growth. The island’s currency gained.  Official data due July 20 may show Taiwan’s export orders
dropped 2.75 percent in June from a year earlier, a fourth
monthly decline, according to the median estimate of economists
in a Bloomberg survey. First-quarter economic expansion was the
slowest since 2009, and the statistics bureau cut its 2012
growth forecast to 3.03 percent in May from 3.38 percent. The
central bank left  interest rates  unchanged at 1.875 percent last
month, and is scheduled to meet again in September.  “Investors are still concerned about the growth outlook,”
said  Albert Lee , a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at Cathay
United Bank Co. “The massive drop in overnight rate is fueling
speculation of an interest-rate cut.”  The  overnight interbank lending rate  slipped two basis
points to 0.407 percent, the lowest since March 27, according to
a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money
Centre.  The  Taiwan dollar  strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$29.984
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, declined five basis points to 3.22
percent.  The yield on the 2 percent bonds due July 2017 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 0.86 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market. It touched 0.842 percent
yesterday, the lowest level for  benchmark five-year rates  since
October 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
