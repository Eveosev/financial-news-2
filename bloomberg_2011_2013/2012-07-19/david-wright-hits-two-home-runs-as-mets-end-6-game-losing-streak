David Wright  hit two home runs and
the  New York Mets  defeated the Washington Nationals 9-5 to halt
their season-worst six-game losing streak.  Wright hit a two-run homer in the first inning and added a
three-run shot in the fourth as the Mets opened a 9-1 lead at
Nationals Park in Washington and held on for the win.  Ike Davis added a home run for the Mets. Starting pitcher
R.A. Dickey allowed four runs -- three earned -- on 10 hits in 7
1/3 innings to improve his record to 13-1 on the season.  The Mets (47-45) avoided a second straight series sweep
with the victory. Washington still has the best record in the
National League after falling to 53-37.  To contact the reporter on this story:
