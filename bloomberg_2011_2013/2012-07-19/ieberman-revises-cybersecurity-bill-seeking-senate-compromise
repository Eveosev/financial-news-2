Senator  Joe Lieberman  introduced a
new version of a bill to boost the nation’s cybersecurity,
seeking a compromise to gain support for a measure that has
stalled over disagreements on government standards.  The proposal would set up voluntary incentives for operators
of critical infrastructure such as power grids and chemical plants
to improve security against computer attacks. Lieberman’s
original bill would have allowed the Department of  Homeland
Security  to create mandatory security standards for
infrastructure.  “We are going to try carrots instead of sticks as we begin
to improve our cyber defenses,” Lieberman, a Connecticut
independent, said in an e-mailed statement. “If that doesn’t
work, a future Congress will undoubtedly come back and adopt a
more coercive system.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
