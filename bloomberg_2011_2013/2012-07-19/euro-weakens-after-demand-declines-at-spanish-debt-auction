The euro dropped for a second day
versus the yen after demand declined at a Spanish debt sale,
adding to concern the regionâ€™s financial turmoil is worsening.  The common currency fell against all except one of its 16
major counterparts after the Bank of  Spain  said demand for the
two-year notes it sold slipped to 1.9 times the amount offered
from 4.26 last month. The bid-to-cover for the five-year
securities dropped to 2.06 times from 3.44 in June.  The euro depreciated 0.3 percent to 96.50 yen at 9:56 a.m.
in  London  after sliding 0.4 percent yesterday. The single
currency dropped 0.1 percent to $1.2273. The yen gained 0.2
percent to 78.63 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
