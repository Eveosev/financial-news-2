Crop prices surged in  Chicago ,
lifting soybeans to a record, as the worst U.S. drought since
1956 scorched fields and raised chances of higher food prices.  Soybeans reached $16.5125 a bushel today on the Chicago
Board of Trade, surpassing the previous peak of $16.3675 on July
3, 2008. Corn rallied to the highest since 2008 and came within
1 percent of its all-time record, while wheat surged above $9 a
bushel to the highest in almost four years.  The U.S. has declared almost 1,300 counties in 29 states as
natural-disaster areas because of drought. Corn and soybean
fields are in the worst shape since 1988, when drought slashed
U.S. corn output by 31 percent, Department of Agriculture data
show. The USDA cut its estimate for this year’s corn crop by 12
percent on July 11, saying production may reach 12.97 billion
bushels. The agency had projected record output of 14.79 billion
bushels in June.  “There is not going to be enough supply to go around,”
said  Richard Feltes , vice president of research at R.J. O’Brien
& Associates in Chicago. “The U.S. drought is laying the
groundwork for higher food inflation into 2013.”  Soybeans for November delivery rose 1.7 percent to $16.48 a
bushel by 7 a.m. on the CBOT. The oilseed jumped 36 percent this
year as U.S. harvest concerns followed a drought that slashed
the past season’s production in Brazil and  Argentina .  Corn for December delivery rallied 1.3 percent to $7.945 a
bushel after touching $7.98. The record for a most-active
contract is $7.9925. Corn has surged 57 percent since mid-June.
Futures for September delivery, the contract closest to
expiration, rose as high as $8.115 today.  Crops Outperform  Wheat, soybeans and corn are the best-performing
commodities in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI  Index (MXWD)  of 24 raw
materials. The GSCI’s Agriculture Index is up 20 percent this
year, while the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities rose 5
percent.  Surging grain and soybean prices may spur a “third wave”
of food inflation following global price shocks that incited
civil unrest in  developing countries  in 2008 and 2011, Barclays
Plc said yesterday in a report. Global  food prices  tracked by
the  United Nations  are down 15 percent from a record reached in
February 2011 and 10 percent below a high set in June 2008.  “The situation has gone from tranquil a few weeks ago to
relatively worrying,” said  Abdolreza Abbassian , an economist in
 Rome  at the UN’s Food & Agriculture Organization, who expects
the drought to spark a rebound in global food prices. “Now the
situation is getting to be pretty critical. Obviously it’s not
going to be a relaxing summer.”  Extreme Drought  More than half of the U.S., excluding Alaska and Hawaii,
was in moderate to extreme drought at the end of June, the
highest percentage since December 1956, according to the
National Climatic Data Center. The drought in the Midwest may
persist for the rest of the growing season, USDA meteorologist
Brad Rippey said yesterday.  While an inch (2.5 centimeters) of rain may fall today in
areas of southern  Wisconsin , northeast  Illinois  and northern
 Indiana , “the balance of the Midwest region will see little, if
any relief, from the unending drought/heat pattern during the
next 10 days,” Telvent DTN said today in a report.  Wheat for September delivery climbed 1.6 percent to $9.175
a bushel after touching $9.2125, the highest since August 2008.
In Paris, November-delivery milling wheat jumped 3.1 percent to
269.75 euros ($331.60) a ton on NYSE Liffe after reaching 271.25
euros, the highest since May 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
