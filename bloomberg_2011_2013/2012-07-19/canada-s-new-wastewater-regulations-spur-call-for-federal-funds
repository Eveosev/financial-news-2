New government regulations to
control wastewater in Canadian waterways sparked a call for
federal funding to help pay for municipal upgrades and an
environmental group to warn about a sewage dumping loophole.  The regulations announced yesterday aim to control effluent
and ensure it’s properly treated before entering  Canada ’s
rivers, lakes and coastlines. Environment Minister Peter Kent
said three-quarters of municipalities already comply with the
rules while the remainder must upgrade at costs that the
government says could be at least C$5 billion ($4.96 billion).  Municipalities considered high risk under the new law have
until 2020 to comply, the government said. The Federation of
Canadian Municipalities has sought a national funding program
for the upgrade costs while the Ecojustice group said the
regulations have a loophole that may permit delays in upgrades
of medium- and high-risk plants for as much as 28 years.  Canadians “deserve to be protected from harmful substances
in our water now, not 28 years from now,” an Ecojustice
scientist, Elaine MacDonald, said in an e-mail from Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
