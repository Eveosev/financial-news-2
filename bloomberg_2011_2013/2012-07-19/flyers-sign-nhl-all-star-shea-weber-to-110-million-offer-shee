The  Philadelphia Flyers  signed All-
Star defenseman Shea Weber to an offer sheet that may be worth
$110 million over 14 years.  Weber, 26, spent his first seven National Hockey League
seasons with the  Nashville Predators . A team captain, Weber was
a finalist as the leagueâ€™s top defenseman last season, when he
had 19 goals and 30 assists for Nashville.  Flyers General Manager Paul Holmgren said in a statement
that the team has signed Weber, a free agent, to an offer sheet,
with no further comment.  TSN of Canada , without saying where it
got the information, reported that Weber was offered $110
million for 14 years, including $68 million in bonus money over
the first six seasons.  The Predators, who earlier this month lost defenseman Ryan Suter to the  Minnesota Wild  as a free agent, have seven days to
match the offer if they want to retain Weber. The Flyers would
probably have to give the Predators four first-round draft picks
as compensation if they sign Weber, TSN said.  Weber was awarded a one-year, $7.5 million contract through
arbitration prior to last season and became a restricted free
agent after failing to reach a long-term deal with Nashville. He
has 99 goals and 164 assists in his career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
