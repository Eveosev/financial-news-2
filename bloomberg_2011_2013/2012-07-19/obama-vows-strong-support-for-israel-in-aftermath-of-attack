President  Barack Obama  vowed the
U.S. will do everything possible to ensure Israel’s security in
the aftermath of a terrorist attack in Bulgaria and instability
in the region caused by upheaval in Syria.  He condemned the “barbaric terrorist attack” in Bulgaria
that killed five Israeli tourists and said this is a moment of
“great uncertainty” in the Mideast “given what’s happening in
Syria.”  “Now’s the time to make sure that we are doing everything
we can to protect Israel’s security, and I want you to know that
that’s something that should transcend party,” Obama said today
at a campaign appearance at a  West Palm Beach , Florida,
retirement community. “That’s not a Republican or Democratic
issue.”  “We haven’t just preserved the unbreakable bond with
Israel,” he said. “We have strengthened it.”  Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  said Lebanon’s
Iranian-backed Hezbollah organization was behind the bombing in
Bulgaria and vowed to track down the perpetrators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
