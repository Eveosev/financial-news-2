Yields on  Colombia ’s peso bonds
dropped for a second day on speculation the central bank will
lower borrowing costs as soon as this month to buoy the Andean
country’s economic growth.  The yield on benchmark 10 percent peso-denominated debt due
in July 2024 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
6.79 percent, according to the central bank. The bond’s price
increased 0.11 centavo to 125.7980 centavos per peso.  “The economic cycle is shifting and the bonds continue to
price in a new environment of lower rates and slowing
inflation,” said  Camilo Perez , the head analyst at Banco de
Bogota, the nation’s second-biggest bank.  The yield on the July 2024 bonds has fallen 22 basis points
this month to the lowest level on a closing basis since the
securities were first sold in 2009.  The central bank held the  overnight lending rate  at 5.25
percent for a fourth straight month on June 29 as growth cooled
and prices of commodity exports dropped. Policy makers will
lower the target to 5 percent at the July 27 meeting, according
to two of 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The rest said the
benchmark will hold steady.  Speculation that there will be a rate cut this year mounted
after minutes of the central bank’s most recent meeting released
July 13 showed more than one member of the seven-member board
voted for a quarter-point interest-rate reduction last month and
wanted the bank to begin a “relaxation phase.”  Central bank chief Jose Dario Uribe said July 17 the bank
will probably lower and narrow the range of its forecast for
2012 Colombian economic growth from the current projection of 4
percent to 6 percent. The upper limit of the current range is no
longer “reasonable,” he said.  The peso erased earlier gains, dropping 0.2 percent to
1,779.50 per dollar. The decline pared its advance this year to
8.9 percent, still the best performance among all currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. Colombia’s markets are closed tomorrow for
 Independence Day .  To contact the reporter on this story:
