Repsol SA (REP) , fighting to keep its
investment-grade rating, agreed to sell a Chilean unit in a deal
that will cut debt by about $317 million. The company’s credit
default swaps fell the most in 12 days.  The Repsol Butano  Chile  subsidiary was sold for about $540
million to a group of investors in the South American country,
the Madrid-based company said today in a filing. Net capital
gains of more than $170 million will be booked on the unit,
which holds 45 percent of Lipigas SA, a distributor of liquefied
petroleum gas in Chile.  With the deal Repsol has achieved more than 40 percent of
the 4.5 billion euros ($5.5 billion) of asset sales targeted in
its five-year plan to reduce debt and protect earnings growth.  Repsol’s 5-year swap, a type of insurance against debt
default, was the second-best performer among Spanish issuers
today. It fell 20 basis points to 434 basis points, second only
to a 61 basis-point drop in  Melia Hotels International SA. (MEL)  The
shares closed 0.6 percent higher at 12.63 euros, matching the
0.6 percent gain in Spain’s IBEX 35 benchmark stock index.  The Argentine government in April seized 51 percent of  YPF
SA (YPFD) , that country’s largest energy company, from Repsol after
saying the company wasn’t investing enough in exploration and
production. Repsol shares dropped 47 percent in the first half,
the worst performance of the 50-member Euro Stoxx 50 index
except for  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , which lost 57 percent in the period.  Repsol’s debt faces a possible downgrade to junk status by
Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, while Standard &
Poor’s Corp. revised its outlook to stable in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
