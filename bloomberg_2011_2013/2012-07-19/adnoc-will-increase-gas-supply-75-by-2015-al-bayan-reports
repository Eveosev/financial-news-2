Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., or
Adnoc, will raise gas supply to customers 75 percent by early
2015, when the Habshan-Maqta-Taweelah pipeline is completed,  Al
Bayan  reported, citing Mohammed Sahoo, the chief executive
officer of Abu Dhabi Gas Industries Co., an Adnoc unit.  The increase means daily supply will rise to 3.91 million
cubic meters of gas, from 2.24 million at present, the newspaper
said. Techint Group, Dodsal Group and Al-Jaber Group won
contracts for gas processing plants worth $1.1 billion from Abu
