The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars held near the lowest in more than seven weeks,
according to a money market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 45 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:30 a.m. in
 London , data compiled by Bloomberg show. The cost was as low as
44.9 basis points yesterday, the cheapest since May 28.  The one-year basis swap was 51 basis points, or 0.51
percentage point, below Euribor. Three-month Euribor, the rate
 banks  say they see each other lending in euros, was set at a
record low 0.464 percent yesterday.  The euro overnight indexed average, Eonia, was unchanged at
11.9 basis points, while an estimate of overnight borrowing
costs over the next three months, the Eonia OIS swap, was little
changed at 10 basis points. Eonia is derived from a daily survey
of banks and published by the European Banking Federation.  Banks cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based ECB
yesterday, placing 360 billion euros ($443 billion) from 382
billion euros the day before. Lenders cut the deposits to the
lowest in seven months on July 11 after the ECB cut its deposit
rate to zero.  To contact the reporter on this story:
