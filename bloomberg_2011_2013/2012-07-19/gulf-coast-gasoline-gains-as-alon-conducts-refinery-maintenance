Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened as
 Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ)  planned to take an off-gas compressor
offline at its Big Spring refinery in Texas for repairs today.  The activity will minimally affect normal operations, the
company said in a filing with the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality. Valero Energy Corp. reported flaring at
its 70,000-barrel-a-day Corpus Christi West as it conducts
planned maintenance.  The discount for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 1.75 cents to 5.25 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:32 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
6.33 cents to $2.8767 a gallon.  The grade fell yesterday to the lowest level since March 8.  Buckeye Partners LP (BPL)  shut its West Shore pipeline on July 17
after a leak of gasoline near Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin, the
company said in a statement.  The area where the leak occurred has been secured and the
company is investigating the incident, according to the
statement issued late yesterday. The 70,000-barrel-a-day line
transports refined products including gasoline,  jet fuel  and
diesel from Chicago to  Green Bay , Wisconsin.  Thereâ€™s been no update to the information at this time,
Martin E. White, a Breinigsville, Pennsylvania-based spokesman,
said in an e-mail today.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Chicago held at 22.5 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
