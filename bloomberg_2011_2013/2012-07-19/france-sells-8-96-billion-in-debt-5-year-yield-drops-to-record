France  sold five-year notes at
record-low borrowing costs as it auctioned 8.96 billion euros
($11 billion) in debt, helped by President  Francois Hollande ’s
budget cuts and the  European Central Bank ’s rate reductions.  France’s 4.5 billion euros in notes maturing in July 2017
yielded on average 0.86 percent today, an all-time low. On June
21, France issued 3.34 billion euros in notes maturing in
February 2017 at 1.43 percent.  Hollande, who took office in May, is benefiting from the
the ECB’s July 5 decision to cut its benchmark  interest rate  to
a record low of 0.75 percent and its deposit rate to zero.
Investors are also looking past France’s record trade deficit
and stalling growth to buy debt seen as safer than  Spain  or
 Italy ’s and offering better returns than Germany securities.  “French sovereign debt is the greatest beneficiary of the
flight to relative safety,” said Nicholas Spiro of Spiro
Sovereign Strategy in  London . “The latest measures taken by
euro zone policy makers, in particular the ECB, are doing more
to support the debt markets of the core and semi-core of the
euro zone than those of the periphery.”  Before the sale today, French benchmark 10-year bonds
yielded 2.037 percent, the lowest since Bloomberg began tracking
the data in 1990. Investors are demanding 85 basis points more
to hold French debt than comparable German bunds.  ‘Malfunctioning Market’  Spanish bonds fell today, with 10-year yields rising above
7 percent for the first time in a week, after the nation’s cost
of borrowing surged at a debt sale. Spain auctioned 2.98 billion
euros of two-, five- and seven-year securities.  France today also sold 1.81 billion euros of three-year
notes at an average yield of 0.12 percent. That’s 97 basis
points lower than achieved at a sale of three-year notes in
February. It sold 2.65 billion euros of 2016 notes, paying 0.53
percent, or 136 basis points lower than achieved in January.  Earlier this month, France sold three- and six-month paper
at negative yields and its one-year securities also currently
trade below zero. Bank of France Governor  Christian Noyer  warned
on July 10 that such rates at least in part reflect a
dysfunction of the euro-area debt markets.  “The fact that France has borrowed at negative rates is
both good and bad news,” Noyer told journalists in Paris. “It
shows the credibility of our country on public finances is
there, yet it also marks a certain malfunctioning of the euro
zone debt markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
