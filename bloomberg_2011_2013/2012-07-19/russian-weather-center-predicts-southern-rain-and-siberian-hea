Rains and storms are forecast in
 Russia ’s Southern, North Caucasus and Volga federal districts
today as heat affects Siberia and the Urals area, the  Federal
Hydrometeorological Center  said.  Hail is expected in the Krasnodar, Stavropol and North
Caucasus republics in the country’s south, the weather
forecaster said on its website.  The Southern, North Caucasus and Volga districts accounted
for 57 percent of Russia’s national grain crop last year,
harvesting 53.8 million metric tons of cereals, according to
government statistics.  Temperatures may rise as high as 37 degrees Celsius (98.6
degrees Fahrenheit) over the three days starting today in most
of the Urals Federal District, the center said. The forecast
also applied to main grain-producing areas in Siberia, including
Altai and Novosibirsk, through July 23.  The Urals and Siberian federal districts accounted for 23
percent of 2011’s national grain crop with a 21.9 million-ton
harvest, the statistics showed.  Russia was the world’s third-biggest wheat exporter last
year after selling 21.3 million tons of the grain in the 2011-12
crop season, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Exports
from the country will drop to 12 million tons in the current
season after dry spring and summer weather this year affected
southern regions and Siberia, according to the USDA.  Russia’s  Agriculture Ministry  on July 17 predicted a
national cereal crop of 80 million to 85 million tons this year,
down from 94.2 million tons in 2011.  Wheat for September delivery climbed 1.7 percent to $9.1825
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 2:15 p.m. Moscow time.
Prices are up 41 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
