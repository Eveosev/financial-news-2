Uganda ’s tax revenue may climb 17
percent in 2012-13 on increased enforcement and a wider tax
base, Allen Kagina, the Uganda Revenue Authority’s commissioner
general, said.  Revenue in the 12 months through June 2013 may rise to 7.25
trillion shillings ($2.94 billion) from 6.21 trillion shillings
in the fiscal year that ended on June 30, she told reporters
today in Kampala, the capital.  Revenue is expected to finance at least three-quarters of
the East African nation’s budget this year, Finance Minister
Maria Kiwanuka said on June 14, with donors including the U.S.,
U.K., Denmark, the European Union funding the rest.  Uganda is set to become Africa’s newest oil producer when
London-based  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  and its partners China National
Offshore Oil Corp. and France’s  Total SA (FP)  begin pumping crude
from the 2.5 billion-barrel discoveries.  The nation earned 72 billion shillings in 2011-12 from
stamp duty, charged on property sale and purchase agreements,
after Tullow sold two-thirds of its Ugandan oilfield interests
to its partners for $2.9 billion, Kagina said. Tullow closed the
sale in February, which gave each company a one-third stake in
the three-block oil concession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
