Oil rose to its highest in seven
weeks in  New York , after U.S. gasoline supplies unexpectedly
shrank and housing starts climbed, signaling fuel demand may
increase amid an economic recovery.  Futures advanced a seventh day in New York, the longest run
of gains since February. Gasoline stockpiles decreased 1.8
million barrels last week, the Energy Department said in a
report. They were forecast to climb by 1.2 million, according to
a Bloomberg News survey. Crude inventories also fell and
petroleum consumption rose for the third week. New U.S. home
construction increased in June to the highest level in almost
four years, figures from the Commerce Department showed.  “The weekly data showed reasonable demand for gasoline
that’s not as weak as had been initially thought,” said Peter Luxton, an analyst at Informa Global Markets in  London , who
forecasts that  Brent crude  will trade at $105 to $110 a barrel
over the next three months. “I’d hesitate to use the word
tightness, but there’s not as much slack in the market as
there’d otherwise have been.”  West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery gained as
much as $1.38, or 1.5 percent, to $91.25 a barrel in electronic
trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  and was at $90.96 as
of 1:35 p.m. London time. The contract expires tomorrow and the
more-active September contract was up $1.15 at $91.32. Front-
month prices gained 65 cents to $89.87 yesterday, the highest
close since May 29 and are 7.7 percent lower this year.  Brent for September settlement was at $106.97 a barrel, up
1.7 percent, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
The European benchmark contract was at a premium to WTI of
$15.67, compared with $14.99 yesterday.  Oil Stockpiles  U.S. oil  demand  averaged almost 19 million barrels a day in
the past four weeks, up 0.4 percent, for a third consecutive
year-on-year increase, the Energy Department report showed
yesterday. Consumption in the past seven days rose 0.3 percent
week-on-week to 18.6 million barrels a day.  Crude stockpiles dropped  809,000 barrels , according to the
report. They were forecast to slip 1.3 million barrels, the
median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News
showed. Distillate inventories, a category that includes heating
oil and diesel, increased  2.6 million barrels , compared with a
projected gain of 1.3 million.  Housing starts  climbed 6.9 percent to a 760,000 annual pace
after a revised 711,000 rate in May that was faster than
initially estimated, the Commerce Department reported in
 Washington  yesterday. The median forecast of 79 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for 745,000.  Mild Positive  “U.S. inventory figures are doing the right thing,” said
Ric Spooner, a chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.
“Housing is an area of the  U.S. economy  where we have seen what
looks to be quite a step-up in growth in recent months, so
that’s a mild positive.”  Oil may drop toward $80 a barrel in New York as prices fail
to break through the top of a so-called Ichimoku cloud,
according to technical analysis by Barclays Plc.  WTI may be capped at $93.75, the upper boundary of the
cloud, which is calculated by analyzing the midpoints of
historical highs and lows and is used to show where buy orders
may be clustered. Its failure to breach that limit suggests its
advance to a seven-week high of $91.06 today won’t hold and that
futures will move toward levels reached in June at about $80,
Barclays said.  Crude’s decline this year has slowed a record expansion of
U.S. oil drilling. The nation’s rig count rose 7.8 percent in
the three months ended June 30, down from 18 percent a year
earlier and the third-lowest quarterly increase since March
2009, according to  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) , a Houston oil-services
company. Horizontal rigs dropped last week for the first time
since May, said Smith Bits, a unit of Huston-based  Schlumberger
Ltd. (SLB) , the world’s largest oilfield-services provider.  To contact the reporters on this story:
