German energy cooperatives have
invested about 800 million euros ($981 million) in clean-energy
sources in the past years, the BSW-Solar lobby said.  At least 80,000 Germans own shares in community-owned
generators, the group said today in an e-mailed statement. About
500 renewable energy cooperatives were formed since 2005, BSW-
Solar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
