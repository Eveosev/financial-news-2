Morgan Stanley (MS)  reported a 50 percent
drop in earnings and said it will cut more jobs as revenue from
trading stocks and bonds declined the most among Wall Street
banks.  Second-quarter net income was $591 million, or 29 cents a
share, compared with $1.19 billion, or a loss of 38 cents, a
year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a
statement. Excluding accounting adjustments, profit was 16 cents
a share, below the 29-cent average  estimate  of 20 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The 48 percent drop in trading revenue, which plunged to
the lowest level since Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman , 54,
took over in January 2010, compares with an increase of more
than 11 percent at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Morgan Stanley said
clients shied away from doing business with the firm while
Moody’s Investors Service weighed a credit-rating downgrade.  The fixed-income results were “very weak,” said Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC in New York who
rates the stock sector perform. “Strength tends to beget
strength and weakness weakness, so I think on the fixed-income
side they’re going to end up being a loser.”  Morgan Stanley fell 2.8 percent to $13.60 at 9:38 a.m. in
New York. The shares were down 7.5 percent this year through
yesterday, after falling 44 percent in 2011, and are 53 percent
below where they traded when Gorman took over. The stock is
trading at about half the firm’s liquidation value and has
dropped  the most  this year of any of the 10 largest U.S. banks.  Job Cuts  The firm has already cut 3,272 jobs since the start of 2012
and expects that number to climb to 4,000 by year’s end, Chief
Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in an interview. Reductions
will be gradual and some may come from attrition, she said.  Revenue dropped to $6.95 billion from $9.21 billion a year
earlier. Book value per share rose to $31.02 from $30.74 at the
end of March. The firm’s return on equity, a measure of how well
it reinvests earnings, was 4 percent, below Gorman’s goal of 15
percent.  Second-quarter revenue from fixed-income sales and trading,
which is run by Ken deRegt, along with commodity trading co-
heads Colin Bryce, and  Simon Greenshields , all 56 years old, was
$770 million, excluding the accounting gain. That missed
estimates of $1.1 billion from Citigroup Inc.’s  Keith Horowitz ,
and $1.39 billion from Barclays Plc’s  Roger Freeman .  Accounting Gain  The accounting gain is known as a debt-valuation
adjustment, or DVA. It stems from a decline in the price of the
company’s bonds, under the theory it would be cheaper to buy
back the debt. Morgan Stanley booked $2 billion of losses in the
first quarter as cost of repurchasing the debt rose.  Fixed-income  revenue  was down 70 percent from $2.59 billion
in the first quarter and 59 percent from $1.9 billion in the
second quarter of 2011.  Goldman Sachs (GS) ’s fixed-income revenue,
excluding DVA, climbed more than 40 percent from a year earlier
to $2.19 billion. Citigroup’s fell 4 percent to $2.82 billion,
while JPMorgan Chase & Co. posted a 17 percent decline to $3.49
billion.  Porat said the results included a $225 million charge
related to $2.9 billion of collateral it had to post after
Moody’s Investors Service cut the firm’s credit rating by two
levels last month. The ratings review also hurt client activity
with the firm, Porat said.  ‘Wait-and-See’  “As the speculation on the ratings outcome lingered,
clients did seem to take a wait-and-see approach,” she said.
“Having that ratings action addressed, now having clarity on it
and having that uncertainty gone, we’re seeing real relief among
clients. Clients have re-engaged, and it’s good to have it
behind us.’  In equities trading, headed by Ted Pick, 43, Morgan
Stanley’s revenue fell 36 percent from the year-earlier period
to $1.14 billion, excluding DVA. That was a 38 percent decline
from the first quarter’s $1.83 billion, and compared with $1.7
billion at Goldman Sachs and $1.04 billion at JPMorgan. Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, had estimated revenue
of $1.45 billion, while Barclays’s Freeman estimated $1.38
billion.  Citigroup on July 16 beat analysts’ estimates on revenue
from advising on mergers, corporate lending and underwriting
stocks and bonds. Goldman Sachs said the next day it plans to
cut $500 million in expenses after reporting the lowest first-
half revenue and earnings in seven years. Both companies are
based in  New York .  Merger Business  The two companies cited a decline in trading and merger
volume amid concern that  Greece  would leave the euro and the
region’s debt crisis would spread to nations including Spain and
 Italy .  Morgan Stanley’s credit-default swaps have fallen since
June 21, when Moody’s Investors Service cut the firm’s credit
rating two grades instead of the threatened three levels. Morgan
Stanley avoided the biggest potential downgrade among U.S. firms
because of support from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., its
largest shareholder, Moody’s said.  The firm had to post collateral of $2.9 billion as a result
of the downgrade, the company said today.  Morgan Stanley generated $884 million in second-quarter
revenue from  investment banking , which is overseen by Paul J. Taubman, 51. That figure, down 40 percent from a year earlier,
included $263 million from financial advisory, $283 million from
equity underwriting and $338 million from debt underwriting.  Stock Underwriting  Morgan Stanley was the second-ranked equity underwriter in
the quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the
lead underwriter on Facebook Inc.’s initial public offering,
which set a record for technology companies by raising more than
$16 billion. The stock has dropped 23 percent since the IPO,
leading to shareholder lawsuits claiming the company and its
underwriters overpriced Facebook at $38 a share.  Morgan Stanley said it adhered to the same procedures it
follows for all IPOs and complied with all applicable
regulations.  Global  wealth management , overseen by  Greg Fleming , 49,
posted pretax income of $393 million, up from $317 million a
year earlier, as revenue fell 4 percent to $3.31 billion. The
division’s pretax profit margin rose to 12 percent from 9
percent in the second quarter of 2011.  Smith Barney  Gorman said on a conference call with analysts that the
bank finished the technology integration of the Morgan Stanley
Smith Barney brokerage this month. He has previously said his
target is a 20 percent pretax margin. The figure was 11 percent
in the first quarter, and Fleming has vowed to raise the margin
to ‘‘mid-teens” by the middle of next year.  Morgan Stanley said in May it would exercise the option to
buy a 14 percent stake in the venture from Citigroup, increasing
its ownership to 65 percent. The two companies’ valuations of
the unit’s value were more than 10 percent apart, requiring a
third-party appraiser to complete the deal, Porat said in the
interview.  Asset management reported a pretax gain of $43 million,
down from $168 million in the previous year’s period.  Compensation and benefits decreased 21 percent from the
year-earlier quarter to $3.63 billion, or 52 percent of the
firm’s overall revenue. The ratio was higher than in the second
quarter of 2011, when the bank set aside 50 percent of revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
