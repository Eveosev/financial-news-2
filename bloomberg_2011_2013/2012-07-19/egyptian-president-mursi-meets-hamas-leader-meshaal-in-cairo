Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi met
with Hamas political leader Khaled Meshaal in Cairo today, the
state-run Middle East News Agency reported.  The two leaders discussed the latest developments in the
reconciliation process between Palestinian factions and Egypt’s
efforts to support the Palestinian cause to establish an
independent state, MENA said.  Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organization by the
U.S., Israel and the European Union, last week called on Egypt
to open its border with the  Gaza Strip  for commercial trade.  Israel and Egypt, which signed a peace treaty in 1979,
sealed Gaza’s borders in June 2007 after Hamas broke off its
power-sharing agreement with the  Palestinian Authority .  To contact the reporter on this story:
