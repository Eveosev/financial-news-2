The Philippine peso retreated from a
four-year high on speculation the central bank will cut  interest
rates  as early as next week to cool currency gains that threaten
exports.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has scope to ease monetary
policy if needed, Governor Amando Tetangco said in an interview
on July 13, after  inflation  slowed for a second month in June to
2.8 percent. Two of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg so far
predict the monetary authority will reduce its  overnight
borrowing  rate for a third time this year on July 26 while the
remaining four forecast the rate will be kept at 4 percent.  “There is a need to address the requirement of overseas
workers and exporters,” said  Jonathan Ravelas , Manila-based
chief market strategist at  BDO Unibank Inc. (BDO) , the nation’s
largest lender. “The central bank may cut rates to achieve
this.”  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 41.743 per dollar in  Manila ,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It touched 41.57 earlier, the
strongest level since April 2008. One-month implied volatility,
a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell 45
basis points to 5.75 percent. Ravelas predicts the central bank
will cut its policy rate to 3.5 percent next week.  Bangko Sentral banned overseas funds from its special
deposit accounts starting this month and on July 13 lowered the
rates on the facility that held 1.64 trillion pesos ($39
billion) in deposits as of June 22.  “Strong capital flows in the face of manageable inflation
is a more near-term concern,” Tetangco said yesterday. A range
of between 42 and 43 is appropriate for the peso, the governor
said on July 13.  The yield on the 6.5 percent bonds due April 2021 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5 percent,
according to Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporters on this story:
