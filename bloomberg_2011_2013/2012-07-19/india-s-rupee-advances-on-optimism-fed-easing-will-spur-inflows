India ’s rupee advanced the most in
almost a week as prospects the U.S. central bank will ease
monetary policy boosted the outlook for inflows into the
nation’s higher-yielding assets.  Overseas investors poured $10 billion into local equities
and bonds this year and have been net buyers every day this
month, exchange data show. India’s 10-year government notes
yield 659 basis points, or 6.59 percentage points, more than
similar-maturity  U.S. debt . Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said yesterday he was prepared to “take further action
as appropriate” to stimulate the country’s growth.  “The U.S. comments have helped boost investor confidence
on global growth,” said Vikas Babu, a currency trader at state-
run  Andhra Bank  in Mumbai. “With global macroeconomics
improving, India stands to benefit substantially.”  The rupee advanced 0.4 percent to 55.2762 per dollar as of
9:59 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency may reach 55.20 before the end of the week, Babu
forecast.  Three-month  offshore  non-deliverable forwards contracts
traded at 56.21 a dollar, compared with 56.32 yesterday.
Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and
date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
