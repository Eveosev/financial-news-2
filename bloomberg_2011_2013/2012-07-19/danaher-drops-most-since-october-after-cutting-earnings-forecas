Danaher Corp. (DHR)  fell the most in four
weeks after the maker of dental and laboratory equipment reduced
its 2012 earnings forecast, citing the strengthening of the
dollar and restructuring expenses.  The  shares  declined 1.9 percent to $51.12 at the close in
New York, the biggest daily slide since June 21. They have
gained 8.7 percent this year.  Full-year profit per share is expected to be $3.19 to
$3.26, down from an earlier forecast of $3.25 to $3.35, the
Washington-based company said in a statement today. Costs for
restructuring will be about $100 million, Danaher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
