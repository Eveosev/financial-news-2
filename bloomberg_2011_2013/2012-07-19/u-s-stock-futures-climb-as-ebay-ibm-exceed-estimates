U.S. stocks rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a two-month high, amid better-
than-estimated earnings and bets that disappointing economic
data will lead the Federal Reserve to add stimulus.  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) , the biggest
computer-services provider, and  EBay Inc. (EBAY) , the largest Internet
marketplace, gained at least 3.7 percent as profits beat
forecasts.  Walgreen Co. (WAG)  surged 12 percent after renewing a
contract with  Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX)   Morgan Stanley (MS)  slid 5.3
percent after missing estimates as trading revenue plunged.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  advanced 0.3 percent to 1,376.51 at 4 p.m. New
York time, the highest since May 3. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  added 34.66 points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,943.36. The
Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.8 percent to 2,965.90. Volume
for exchange-listed stocks in the U.S. was 7 billion shares
today, up 4.8 percent from the three-month average.  “We’ve been watching very good earnings, but there were
too many disappointing economic reports today,”  Richard Sichel ,
who oversees $1.6 billion as chief investment officer at
Philadelphia Trust Co., said in a phone interview. “There’s
some comfort based on the idea that if things get worse, the Fed
will do something. We’ll have to wait and see.”  Today’s advance extended a three-day rally in the S&P 500
to 1.7 percent. Earnings have exceeded analyst  estimates  at
about 71 percent of the 102 S&P 500 companies that have reported
quarterly results so far, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Analysts project a 2.1 percent decline in second-
quarter profits, the data showed.  Economic Data  Investors also watched economic data. Sales of existing
U.S. homes unexpectedly dropped and manufacturing in the
Philadelphia region contracted for a third month. Other reports
today showed consumer confidence weakened, claims for
unemployment benefits rose and an index of leading economic
indicators declined more than forecast.  Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said policy makers are studying options for further easing that
could be deployed in case economic growth remains too feeble to
produce a lasting decline in unemployment. The Federal Open
Market Committee meets Aug. 1 to continue debating whether
further action is needed.  Bets on more stimulus measures and better-than-estimated
earnings helped send the Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of
companies most-tied to the economy up 2.7 percent in three days.
Technology companies, which make up about  20 percent  of the S&P
500, added 1.4 percent today for the best gain among 10 groups.  IBM (INDU)  climbed 3.8 percent, the most since Jan. 20, to
$195.34. IBM, which accounts for more than 11 percent of the
Dow, added 54 points to the share price-weighted average.  Technology Spending  The company’s decade-long shift to higher-margin software
sales helped it overcome a slowdown in technology spending last
quarter. IBM aims to get half of its  earnings  from software by
2015 -- a move away from less-profitable hardware and services.  EBay soared 8.6 percent to $43.95, the highest price since
2006. Chief Executive Officer  John Donahoe  has increased
spending on advertising and new technology to expand beyond
EBay’s auction roots and let shoppers buy more items in instant
sales, similar to those on Amazon.com Inc.’s site.  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)  increased 4.3 percent to $58.44. The largest
seller of mobile-phone semiconductors gained after quarterly
results showed consumers in emerging markets are trading up to
next-generation handsets, lifting profitability.  Textron Inc. (TXT)  rallied 12 percent to $26.50 as earnings beat
estimates. The company is considering a bid for part or all of
Hawker Beechcraft Inc., the bankrupt business-jet maker in
exclusive talks with China’s Superior Aviation Beijing Co.  Capital One  Capital One Financial Corp. (COF)  climbed 2.7 percent to $56.37.
The lender that gets more than half of its revenue from credit
cards reported second-quarter results that exceeded some
analysts’ estimates.  Walgreen soared 12 percent, the most since 2008, to $34.62.
The largest U.S. drugstore chain renewed a contract to provide
Express Scripts customers with prescriptions, ending a dispute
that contributed to an 11 percent drop in the retailer’s
quarterly profit. Express Scripts rallied 1.9 percent to $58.76.
 CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS)  lost 6.5 percent to $45.43.  J.C. Penney Co. (JCP)  jumped 4.8 percent to $20.66.  Bill Ackman ,
the founder of Pershing Square Capital Management LP, reiterated
his confidence in Chief Executive Officer  Ron Johnson ’s
turnaround efforts.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  added 4.6 percent to $15.13. The world’s
largest maker of thin-film solar panels advanced after two
Mumbai-based companies secured U.S. loans to buy panels.  Electronic Arts  Electronic Arts Inc. (EA)  surged 6.7 percent to $12.27. The
second-largest video-game publisher gained after Chief Executive
Officer John Riccitiello suggested investors are overlooking the
company’s growth potential.  Some of the largest financial institutions declined today.
Morgan Stanley slumped 5.3 percent to $13.25. The New York-based
company reported a 50 percent drop in earnings and said it will
cut more jobs as revenue from trading stocks and bonds declined
the most among Wall Street banks.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  dropped 3.6 percent to $7.26.
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  lost 1.9 percent to $26.59.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) 
retreated 1.4 percent to $34.46.  Phone shares had the biggest decline among 10 groups in the
 S&P 500 , falling 1.8 percent.  Verizon (VZ)  Communications Inc., the second-largest U.S. phone
company, dropped 2.9 percent to $44.54. Second-quarter net
income attributable to Verizon rose to $4.29 billion, or 64
cents a share, from $3.6 billion, or 57 cents, a year earlier.
That matched the average estimate of analysts, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Lower Forecast  Johnson Controls Inc. dropped 7.9 percent to $26.07. The
largest U.S. auto supplier lowered its forecast for profit for
the fourth quarter because of softness in global markets.  UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH)  slipped 2.4 percent to $54.99.
Chief Executive Officer Stephen Hemsley said profit margins are
being squeezed in its Medicare and Medicaid plans.  Greenhill & Co. retreated 3.5 percent to $36.36. The
advisory firm founded by Robert Greenhill reported a 90 percent
drop in second-quarter net income.  Safeway Inc. (SWY)  slid 4.2 percent to $15.80. The second-largest
U.S. grocer reported a 17 percent decline in quarterly profit
from continuing operations.  Millionaires added U.S. stocks more than any other asset in
the latest year as average investors fled to bonds, according to
a survey by Fidelity Investments.  1,020 Households  Twenty percent of the 1,020 households surveyed said they
bought individual domestic equities in the 12 months ended in
March, the Boston-based mutual fund firm said. Cash ranked
second, with 13 percent saying they added to that asset class.
Eleven percent purchased exchange-traded funds, and 10 percent
each added individual U.S. bonds or domestic stock funds.  The broader investing public has sought refuge in fixed
income since the global credit crisis sent the S&P 500 down 38
percent in 2008, eight years after the meltdown in technology
stocks. U.S. equity mutual funds suffered net withdrawals of
$130 billion in the 12 months ended March 31, according to
Chicago-based research firm Morningstar Inc. Bond funds
attracted $191 billion. The S&P 500 gained 9.2 percent this year
through yesterday.  “They’re probably ahead of the average investor in how
they view opportunities,” Bob Oros, executive vice president in
Fidelity’s institutional wealth services group, said of
millionaires in an interview. “They’re becoming less and less
risk-averse.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
