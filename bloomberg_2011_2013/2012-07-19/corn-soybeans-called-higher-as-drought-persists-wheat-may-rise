What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel higher as a
drought that covers 78 percent of U.S. growing areas will
persist through the rest of the summer, Matt Ammermann, an
analyst at INTL FCStone in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone
interview.  -- Soybean futures may open up 4 cents to 5 cents a bushel
because of the hot, dry weather, Ammermann said. Soybean-oil
futures are expected to open 0.2 cent to 0.3 cent a pound lower,
and soybean-meal futures may open $1 to $2 higher per 2,000
pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel higher as
drought in the U.S. and dry weather in Australia and  Russia  may
curb production, Ammermann said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
