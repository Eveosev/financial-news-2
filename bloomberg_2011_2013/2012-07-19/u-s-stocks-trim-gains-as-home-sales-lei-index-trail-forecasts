U.S. stocks trimmed gains after
reports showed existing home sales unexpectedly decreased and a
gauge of leading indicators declined more than forecast,
underscoring concern the economic rebound is slowing.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose less than 0.2 percent
to 1,375.35 at 10:04 a.m. in  New York  after earlier climbing as
much as 0.4 percent.  Purchases  of existing homes decreased 5.4 percent to a
4.37 million annual rate last month from a revised 4.62 million
in May, figures from the National Association of Realtors showed
today in  Washington . The median forecast of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News called for a 4.62 million pace.  The Conferences Board’s gauge of the outlook for the next
three to six months decreased 0.3 percent after a revised 0.4
percent increase in May, the New York-based group said today.
Economists projected the gauge would drop by 0.1 percent,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
