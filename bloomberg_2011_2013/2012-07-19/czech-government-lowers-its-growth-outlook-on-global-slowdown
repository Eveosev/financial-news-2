The Czech government lowered its
economic-growth forecasts for this year and next as the global
outlook worsens, CTK reported, citing documents from a Cabinet
meeting today.  Gross domestic product will contract 0.5 percent this year
before returing to growth of 1 percent in 2013, the newswire
reported. The public-finance deficit will be narrowed until 2015
at a slower pace then previously estimated, CTK said. By 2015,
the shortfall will be 1.6 percent of GDP, compared with an April
outlook of 0.9 percent, according to the materials.  The deficit this year will be 3.2 percent of GDP, compared
with a previous estimate of 3 percent, CTK said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
