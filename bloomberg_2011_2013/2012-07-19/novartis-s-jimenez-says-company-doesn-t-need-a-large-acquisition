Novartis AG (NOVN)  is interested in making
so-called bolt-on acquisitions to complement its five divisions,
rather than making a large purchase, Chief Executive Officer  Joe Jimenez  said.  “We’re obviously looking at a number of potential assets
in those areas, but we’re going to have a very disciplined
approach to M&A,” Jimenez said on a call with reporters today,
after the drugmaker reported second-quarter profit. “I don’t
think we need a larger acquisition.”  Novartis’s priority is to pay off debt related to its
acquisition of the Alcon eye-care business, which the Basel,
Switzerland-based company bought in stages for $50 billion
starting in 2008, Jimenez said. Novartis said in May it will pay
$1.53 billion for closely held Fougera Pharmaceuticals Inc. in a
deal to become the top seller of generic skin medications.  “We are positioned very well to perform at the high end of
the industry over the next five years,” Jimenez said.  Novartis’s five divisions are pharmaceuticals, the Alcon
eye-health unit, the generics division Sandoz, consumer health
products, and vaccines and diagnostics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
