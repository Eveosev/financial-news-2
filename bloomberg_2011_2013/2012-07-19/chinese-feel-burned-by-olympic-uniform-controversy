When news broke last week that  Ralph Lauren  was supplying U.S. Olympians with “made-in-China”  uniforms , Senator  Harry Reid  couldn’t hide his anger, political opportunism or lack of concern for how his response might be received abroad. He  told  a group of reporters at a press conference for a Democratic jobs bill, “They should take all the outfits, put them in a big pile and burn them and start all over again.” Had Reid muted his remarks -- say, suggested that future uniforms be made in the U.S. -- few in China would have noticed or cared. After all, “China bashing” as a U.S. political phenomenon -- one that only increases in popularity during election years -- is well-known in China. Suggesting, however, that Chinese-manufactured goods be burned is not. And so, the Olympic uniform controversy soon filled Chinese news  programs ,  microblogs  and  editorial pages . Most commentators focused on what they perceive to be the narrow-minded hypocrisy of cynical American  politicians . Take this inflammatory but representative  tweet  on Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblog, from Yang Rui, a notoriously jingoistic  host  on the English-language channel of the state-owned  China Central Television : Yang’s tirade is extreme only in tone. Insofar as he blames Reid’s comment on the overheated rhetoric that emerges from U.S. presidential campaigns, he’s fully in the mainstream. The more moderate “CCTV Commentators,” a group Sina Weibo account registered to CCTV’s stable of editorial commentators,  tweeted  this wary observation on July 17: Several Chinese commentators have tried to delve deeper into why U.S. politicians focus on globalization in election years, with many lamenting (perhaps with fake tears) America’s alleged former role as an upholder of free trade around the world. Of these commentaries, none is more pointed than that of Wang Yusheng, the executive director of the state-chartered  China  Foundation for International Studies; on July 17, he  wrote  in Shanghai’s Liberation Daily, a paper owned by the local Communist Party committee: Wang offers three unflattering possible answers to the question, one of which invokes the Boxer Uprising of a century ago, a Chinese nationalist rebellion that targeted foreigners and Christians: Naming Chinese-made products that Americans might next burn, after the uniforms, has become a bit of a low-grade parlor game among Chinese microbloggers (iPhones are, by far, the favored candidate). A few commentators have also suggested turning the tables and burning American products. Predictably, these are not the most level-headed tweets. Shao Bing, a highly regarded poet,  rants : Others extrapolate that Reid's actual slight is a parable of how the U.S. refuses to recognize China as an emerged -- rather than an emerging -- power. On July 15, Lin Mu He, chief executive officer of a Beijing-based investment firm,  tweeted  on Sina Weibo: Most responses to Reid rely not on anger but on humor to highlight perceived American hypocrisy. At the same time, many commentators  believe  that Reid’s remarks, and the U.S. outsourcing debate as a whole, are part of President Obama’s campaign to bring manufacturing back to the  U.S. , while highlighting Romney’s Bain years. From these two strains comes an awkward joke that’s emerged in various forms over the last couple days. Zhao Chao, a senior writer with the sports channel at Sina.com, a major Chinese internet portal, who claims to have seen it tweeted by a Chinese man living in Japan,  retweeted  it in this form: This kind of personal attack is common practice on China’s microblogs. It is not, however, the message that the Communist Party or its state media organizations want to project. That’s not to suggest that the Party and its propaganda apparatus disagree with mainstream sentiment. It’s just that they feel the need to phrase it differently, as they did in a July 16  editorial  issued -- and widely circulated -- by Xinhua, the state news agency: On the night of July 27, U.S. athletes will enter the Olympic Stadium for the  opening ceremony , wearing Ralph Lauren-designed, Chinese-made uniforms. Due to time constraints, the U.S. Olympic Committee is unable to promise uniforms manufactured at home until the  2014 Games . At least one Chinese microblogger still has  high hopes  for the 2012 U.S. Olympians: “After they burn their uniforms I’ll look forward to a nude Olympics opening ceremony.” (Adam Minter, the Shanghai correspondent for the World View blog, is writing a book on the global recycling industry.
