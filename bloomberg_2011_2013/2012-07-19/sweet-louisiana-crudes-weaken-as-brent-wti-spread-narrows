Sweet Louisiana oil premiums
weakened as West Texas Intermediate’s discount to Brent oil
narrowed.  The gap between WTI and Brent decreased 16 cents to $14.83
a barrel based on September settlement prices. When Brent falls
versus WTI, it typically weakens the value of U.S. grades that
compete with foreign oils priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI decreased 10 cents
to $16 a barrel at 1:59 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet lost 45 cents to
$15 over WTI.  Poseidon’s premium decreased 75 cents to $9.80 a barrel.
Southern Green Canyon added 20 cents to $9.30 over WTI. Mars
Blend decreased 35 cents to $10.45 a barrel over the U.S.
benchmark.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
decreased 35 cents to $14.15.  Syncrude’s premium was steady at $3 over WTI. Syncrude is a
synthetic oil upgraded from tarlike bitumen in  Alberta  into
refinery-ready crude.  Western Canada Select’s discount was unchanged at $16.55 a
barrel below WTI.  Bakken oil’s discount was steady at 50 cents below the U.S.
benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
