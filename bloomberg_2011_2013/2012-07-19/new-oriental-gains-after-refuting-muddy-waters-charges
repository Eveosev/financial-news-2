New Oriental Education & Technology
Group Inc. (EDU)  rose the most since September 2006, halting a two-
day, 57 percent slump, after contesting allegations by short
seller Muddy Waters LLC about the company’s accounting
practices.  The American depositary receipts of New Oriental jumped 30
percent to $12.35 by 10:39 a.m. in  New York , after sinking to
$9.50 yesterday. Today’s advance snapped a nine-day retreat.  New Oriental,  China ’s largest private education services
provider, said it owned 664 schools and learning centers by the
end of May, and Muddy Waters’ allegation that a large part of
them are franchised outlets is wrong, according to a statement
today. The Beijing-based company has never counted the 21
cooperation facilities it has and their student enrollments as
its own, it said.  In a report yesterday,  Muddy Waters  questioned the
ownership of some of New Oriental’s schools and the
consolidation of their financial statements with the parent
company.  New Oriental said on July 17 that the Securities and
Exchange Commission issued an order of investigation to review
the consolidated earnings of its subsidiaries.  Zachery Kouwe, an external media relations manager for
Muddy Waters, didn’t immediately return calls and an e-mail
message by Bloomberg seeking comment on New Oriental’s
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
