A 38-year-old woman was convicted of
planning to bomb Jewish targets in the northern England city of
Manchester, police said today.  Shasta Khan along with her husband, Mohammed Sajid Khan,
were “in the early stages of building an improvised explosive
device to target Jewish communities,” Manchester police said in
a statement. Both will be sentenced tomorrow on the terror-
related charges.  The couple accessed online bomb-making manuals and
stockpiled household items which could be used to construct a
homemade bomb from March 2011 to July 2011, according to
Manchester police.  The couple was found driving around Jewish communities to
“look at possible targets” and officers discovered “extremist
literature espousing anti-Semitic and violent jihadist
beliefs,” the force said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
