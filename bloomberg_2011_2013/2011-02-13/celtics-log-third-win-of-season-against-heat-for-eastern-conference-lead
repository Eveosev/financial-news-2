The  Boston Celtics  defeated the
Miami Heat 85-82 behind a triple-double from Rajon Rondo to take
over as the top team in the Eastern Conference.  Rondo had 11 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, while
Kevin Garnett added 19 points and seven rebounds for the Celtics
(39-14) at TD Garden in Boston.  The Celtics snapped a two-game losing streak and sent Miami
(39-15) to its first loss in nine games. Boston is now 3-0
against the Heat this season with one meeting left, clinching a
possible head-to-head tiebreaker for home-court advantage in the
National Basketball Association playoffs.    LeBron James  scored 22 points for Miami, while Chris Bosh
had 24 points and 10 rebounds.  The Heat led 43-39 at halftime before the Celtics opened
the third quarter with a 20-3 scoring run.  Bostonâ€™s record is the second-best in the NBA behind the  San Antonio Spurs  (45-9).  To contact the reporter on this story:
