  Saudi Arabia  plans to reduce
domestic energy consumption by around 40 percent by forcing
construction companies to use better building materials that
conserve energy in homes, al-Watan reported.  Around 70 to 80 percent of the electricity generated in
Saudi Arabia is used to air-condition homes, the Saudi  newspaper 
cited Minister of Water and Electricity Abdullah al-Hussayen as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
