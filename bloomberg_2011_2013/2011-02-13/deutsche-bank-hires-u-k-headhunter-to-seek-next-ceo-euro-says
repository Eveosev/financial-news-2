  Deutsche Bank AG  assigned a U.K.
recruiting firm to seek candidates to succeed  Josef Ackermann  as
chief executive officer,  Euro am Sonntag  reported, citing no
one.  Deutsche Bank decided to look for external candidates after
several internal aspirants indicated they may quit if they’re
not considered for the top job, the newspaper said, without
becoming more specific.  The possibility of Bundesbank President Axel Weber, who
resigned on Feb. 11, to succeed Ackermann has not been discussed
yet by Deutsche Bank’s supervisory board, the newspaper said,
citing an unidentified member of the panel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
