The Islamic world is entering a
period of extraordinary changes following popular protests that
overthrew presidents in Egypt and  Tunisia , Turkey’s President
Abdullah Gul said.  "Change is being led by the people because the leaders
wouldn’t do it," Gul said in an interview broadcast by CNN-Turk
television from Ankara’s Esenboga Airport before departing on a
state visit to  Iran .  Turkey expects the Egyptian army to turn power over to a
civilian administration as quickly as possible, and for free
elections to be held under the observation of international and
local monitors, he said. "Our wish is to see the Egyptian state
emerge stronger and to take the place it deserves on the
international stage," Gul said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
