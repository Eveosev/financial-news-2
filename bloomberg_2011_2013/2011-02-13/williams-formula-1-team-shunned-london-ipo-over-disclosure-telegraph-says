The owner of the Williams Formula
One racing team opted for a stock-market listing in  Frankfurt 
instead of the U.K. because of the  London  Stock Exchange’s
“ludicrous” disclosure rules, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  The newspaper cited an interview with Adam Parr, executive
chairman of Williams Grand Prix Holdings Plc. The LSE and its
Alternative Investment Market for smaller companies require
listed companies to report the value of contracts that amount to
10 percent or more of revenue, it said.  “We have confidentiality provisions, not just with Formula
One, but with partners that would just make that impossible,”
Parr said, according to the Sunday Telegraph. Frankfurt’s stock
exchange requires no such disclosures and lets companies use
GAAP, or generally accepted accounting principles, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Michael Patterson  in London at
