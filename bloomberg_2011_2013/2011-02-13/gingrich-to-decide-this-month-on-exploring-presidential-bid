  Newt Gingrich , former Republican
House Speaker, said he may decide this month whether he will set
up a committee to explore running against President Barack Obama
in 2012.  Gingrich, a Georgian who led the “Republican Revolution”
in 1994, when the party gained 52 House seats, spoke on ABC’s
“This Week” program today.  “I’ll probably make a decision by the end of this month
about whether or not to set up an exploratory committee,”
Gingrich said.  Almost a dozen Republicans weighing a bid against Obama
blamed the President for stifling  job creation  and weakening the
economy during the annual Conservative Political Action
Conference that ended yesterday in Washington with an
unscientific presidential straw poll.  Texas Republican Representative  Ron Paul , who has run for
president as a Libertarian Party candidate, received 30 percent
of the tally, followed by former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. The poll results showed that 3,742 of the more than
11,000 conference attendees voted.  “I’ve never seen a more wide-open race for a Republican
nomination,” House Speaker  John Boehner  said on NBC’s “Meet
the Press” program today. “We’re going to need someone who can
paint a vision of the future that takes into consideration that
we need a smaller, less costly and more accountable government
in Washington.”  Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour said on the “Fox News
Sunday” program today that he’s “very serious” about
considering a presidential candidacy and may make his decision
by April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
