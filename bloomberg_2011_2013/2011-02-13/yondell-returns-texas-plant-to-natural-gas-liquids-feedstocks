  LyondellBasell Industries NV  is
returning it’s Channelview plant in Texas to a natural gas
liquids feedstock slate after switching to naphtha following a
Feb. 8 fire that disrupted third-party supplier deliveries.  The plant, which plant has two olefins units each with a
capacity of 1.95 billion pounds a year, switched to a naphtha
feedstock after a fire broke out Feb. 8 at Enterprise Products
Partners LP’s Mont Belvieu natural gas liquids storage site.  Lyondell’s La Porte plant in Texas, which also has an
ethylene unit, is boosting operating rates as feedstock
flexibility increases due to the use of alternative pipelines,  David Harpole , a company spokesman, said in an e-mail. “We are
continuing to address logistics that will enable us to return to
full rates,” he said.  Lyondell said it reduced production at its La Porte and
Channelview chemical plants in Texas after the Feb. 8 Mont
Belvieu fire cut the company’s ethane and propane supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
