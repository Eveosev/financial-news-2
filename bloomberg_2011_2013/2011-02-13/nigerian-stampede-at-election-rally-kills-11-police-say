A stampede at an election rally by
Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan in the southern city of  Port Harcourt  killed 11 people and injured 46, the police said.  A rush at one of the exits at the Port Harcourt stadium as
people were leaving the rally yesterday caused the deaths and
injuries, Rita Inoma-Abbey, police spokeswoman in the southern
oil hub, said today by phone from the city. Police Commissioner
Suleiman Abba said earlier that four people died.  The police “ordered an inquiry into the incident,” Inoma-
Abbey said.  Jonathan, who succeeded former President Umaru Yar’Adua on
his death last year, is the candidate of the ruling People’s  Democratic Party  in the presidential vote scheduled to take
place on April 9. His main challengers include former military
ruler Muhammadu Buhari and Nuhu Ribadu, an ex-chief of the West
African nation’s anti-corruption agency.  The winner of the vote will take charge of the affairs of  Africa ’s most populous country and top oil producer for the next
four years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
