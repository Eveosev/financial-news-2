Kuwait’s Supreme Petroleum Council
may approve building a fourth oil refinery when it meets on Feb.
15,  Al-Jarida  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The SPC, the country’s highest decision-making body for oil
policy, may also approve a “clean-fuel project,” the newspaper
said. The project involves an upgrade of two of the three
existing refineries -- Mina Al-Ahmadi and Mina Abdulla.  To contact the reporter on this story:
