The  French Open  will stay in Paris,
the French Tennis Federation said, opting to expand and
modernize the existing site of  Roland Garros  in Porte d’Auteuil
rather than move the tournament outside the city.  Paris beat Marne-la-Vallée in the third round of voting at
a general assembly after Gonesse and Versailles were eliminated,
the FFT said today in a  statement  on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Andrew Roberts  in Paris at
