Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications
announced its first Android handset with PlayStation gaming
capabilities for shipment later this spring.    Verizon Wireless  and other carriers will sell the handset
starting in April, Chief Executive Officer Bert Nordberg said in
an interview at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona today.
The price in  Europe  will be between about 199 euros ($270) and
299 euros depending on subsidies, he said.  Sony Ericsson, which earlier made specialized Walkman phones
for music and Cybershot phones for photography, is trying to
leverage the popularity of parent  Sony Corp .’s PlayStation
gaming consoles to capture mobile gamers who want faster
response time than regular smartphones can offer. The Xperia
Play has a slideout PlayStation control board and 60 frame-per-
second playback.  The joint venture between Japan’s Sony and Sweden’s
Ericsson AB, also refreshed its existing line based on Google
Inc.’s Android software with two new models, one of which has a
slideout keyboard for business users.  To contact the reporter on this story:
