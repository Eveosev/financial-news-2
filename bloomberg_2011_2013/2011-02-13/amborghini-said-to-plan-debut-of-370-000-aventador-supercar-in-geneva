Lamborghini SpA  will unveil a
flagship supercar costing more than $370,000 called the
Aventador, its most powerful series production vehicle ever, at
the Geneva Motor Show, a person with direct knowledge of the
plans said.  The Aventador LP 700-4, which has a 700-horsepower V12
engine that surges to 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour in 2.9
seconds, will premiere March 1, said the person, who asked not
to be identified before the model is shown publicly.  The Aventador, which replaces the  Volkswagen AG  brand’s
top-of-the-line Murcielago model, is already sold for the first
year of production, the person said. Lamborghini, which competes
with  Fiat SpA ’s Ferrari, will decide over the next year whether
to add a third model to its portfolio to complement the
Aventador and Gallardo lines, the person said.  “People may be ripping order forms for the new Lamborghini
out of salesmen’s hands,” said Christoph Stuermer, a Frankfurt-
based analyst at IHS Automotive. “The timing seems right, it’s
no longer deemed inappropriate to flaunt your wealth.”   Lamborghini is counting on the Aventador to help capitalize
on a recovering market for luxury autos costing more than
$200,000. Supercar sales in the U.S., the top market for the
world’s most expensive cars, may surge 146 percent this year for
vehicles costing from $200,000 to $400,000 after plunging 40
percent in 2010, according to IHS.  Sant’Agata Bolognese, Italy-based Lamborghini is ramping up
production of the Aventador and may expand output to build as
many as 100 of the cars by March 1, the person said. The brand
is already taking orders and will start selling the new model,
which has a top speed of 350 kilometers per hour, in the second
quarter in showrooms. Lamborghini spokesman Raffaello Porro
declined to comment on the carmaker’s Geneva plans.  ‘Outrageous Supercars’  “Lamborghini’s reason for being is about making outrageous
supercars,” said  Jim Hall , an analyst at consulting firm 2953
Analytics Inc. in Birmingham,  Michigan . “Their new flagship
will be critically important to underpin that position.”  Supercar sales are growing amid a renewed sense of optimism
among bankers after the  U.S. economy , the world’s biggest,
expanded 2.9 percent last year, the most in five years.  JPMorgan
Chase & Co .’s profits last year were the highest in the bank’s
history, and Citigroup Inc. returned money to the  U.S. Treasury 
and reported its first full-year profit since 2007.  Workers at big Wall Street banks continued to outpace other
professions in earnings even as they took modest cuts in pay in
2010.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc ., Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan’s
investment bank spent an average of $330,212 on salaries,
bonuses and benefits for each of their 124,556 workers in last
year, according to financial reports released since Jan. 14, a
decline of 2.7 percent from 2009.  Lower Weight Cars  Lamborghini, founded in 1963 and acquired by Volkswagen in
1998, aims to produce lower weight cars by increasing the share
of components made of carbon fibers as emission standards are
tightened in Europe and the U.S.  The Aventador will weigh about 1,570 kilograms (3,461
lbs.), a reduction of as much as 95 kilograms compared with
predecessor Murcielago LP 640, the person said. The lighter
weight reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions about 20
percent, the person said.  The Aventador will have a safety frame made entirely from
carbon fiber, similar to what’s used in Formula One race cars.
Lamborghini set up a center at its Italian headquarters in July
2010 to develop the light composites that complement metals in
car frames and in 2009 began a partnership with aircraft maker
Boeing Co. to crash-test carbon fiber.  “Lamborghini is committed to optimizing the use of light
composites,” said  Stefan Bratzel , director of the Center of
Automotive Management at the University of Applied Sciences in
Bergisch-Gladbach,  Germany . “Carbon fiber will be key to making
high-performance cars in future, the material implies enormous
benefits for handling and braking those vehicles.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
