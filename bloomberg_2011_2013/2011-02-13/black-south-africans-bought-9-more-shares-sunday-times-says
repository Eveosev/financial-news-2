Purchases by black South Africans of
shares in locally based companies rose 9 percent to about 24
billion rand ($3.3 billion) last year, the Sunday Times
reported, citing Who Owns Who, a privately owned publication.  The two largest acquisitions were Ayigobi’s purchase of a
stake in ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd., a deal worth 9 billion
rand, and MTN Group Ltd.’s Zakhele transaction valued at 2.78
billion rand, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
