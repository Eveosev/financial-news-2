Gay couples in Britain will be able
to marry in places of worship under plans to be outlined by  David Cameron ’s Conservative-led government, the Sunday
Telegraph reported.  Equalities minister Lynne Featherstone, a Liberal
Democrat, is set to publish proposals to lift the ban on civil
partnership ceremonies being held in places of worship, the
London-based newspaper said today.  Such ceremonies may also be permitted to include for the
first time religious elements such as hymns or readings from the
Bible, according to the report.  The changes represent a political victory for  Nick Clegg ’s
Liberal Democrats, the junior partner in the coalition
government, and will please equality campaigners, the newspaper
said. Still, they are likely to infuriate church groups and
traditionalist Conservatives, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
