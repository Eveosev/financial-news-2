Former German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck doesnâ€™t want to run for the next presidency of the  European Central Bank ,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported.  Steinbrueck, who was proposed as a possible candidate for
the ECB by fellow Social Democrat Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said
in an interview that he considers it to be wrong if a former
finance minister were to head the Frankfurt-based ECB, the
newspaper said.  Bundesbank President  Axel Weber  resigned on Feb. 11. Weber
was seen as the front-runner to replace Jean-Claude Trichet at
the helm of the ECB in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
