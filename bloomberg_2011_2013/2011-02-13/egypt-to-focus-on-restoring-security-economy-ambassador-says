  Egypt ’s military leadership will
initially focus on restoring security and the economy, Sameh Shoukry, the country’s ambassador to the U.S., said today.  “The first priority are security and the economic welfare,
but that doesn’t preclude that the reform process would not go
ahead as well,” Shoukry said on  ABC’s “This Week” program.  Egypt doesn’t yet have a timetable for lifting the
emergency law, a demand of protesters, he said. The country’s
military leaders will end the emergency law “as conditions
stabilize,” he said.  The country’s peace treaty with  Israel  is a “main element
in terms of our foreign policy” and will stand, he said.  “The treaty has been beneficial to Egypt over the last 30
years or more” Shoukry said. “We have derived a peace dividend
from the treaty. We’ve been able to establish security and
stability in the region.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
