The Turkish Cypriot economy is "very
seriously weak," Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said
in an interview with  CNN-Turk  television.    Turkey  wants Turkish Cypriots to find a way to build an
economy that can stand on its own without Turkish assistance, he
said.  Davutolgu’s remarks come a day after the Turkish minister
in charge of northern Cypriot affairs, Cemil Cicek, said the
self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus was in danger
of going bankrupt if it didn’t reform its economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
