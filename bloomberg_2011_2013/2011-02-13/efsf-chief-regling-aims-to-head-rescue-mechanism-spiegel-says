Klaus Regling, head of the euro
area’s bailout fund, wants to become president of the region’s
new rescue mechanism and has expressed his desire to the German
government,  Der Spiegel  reported, without saying where it got
the information.  Regling has been mentioned in German media reports as a
possible candidate for the presidency of the  European Central
Bank  following the surprise resignation by Bundesbank chief Axel
Weber on Feb. 11. Weber was seen as the front-runner to replace
Jean-Claude Trichet at the ECB in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
