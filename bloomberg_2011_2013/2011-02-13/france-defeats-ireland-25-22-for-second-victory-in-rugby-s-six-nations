Defending champion  France  beat
Ireland 25-22 in Dublin today for its second straight victory in
rugby’s Six Nations championship.  Ireland, winner of the tournament in 2009, got three tries
to the visitors’ one but paid the price for ill-discipline in
conceding penalties.  Fergus McFadden’s try, converted by Jonathan Sexton, gave
Ireland a 7-0 lead, but Morgan Parra took advantage of rule
infringements by Ireland to score four first-half penalties.  Sexton got a penalty for the home team, and just before
halftime Tomas O’Leary was awarded a try after a video replay to
leave Ireland leading 15-12 at the interval.  Penalties by Parra and replacement Dimitri Yachvili and a
try by Maxime Medard made it 25-15 for France as Yachvili added
the conversion. Then Jamie Heaslip crowned a period of intense
Irish pressure with a try converted by replacement Ronan O’Gara
to narrow the gap to three points.  Ireland subjected the visitors to more attacks as the clock
ticked down but France weathered the storm for its second
straight win after beating  Scotland  a week ago.  Yesterday, Chris Ashton became the first  England  player to
score four tries in a Six Nations match as his team beat Italy
59-13 at Twickenham.  Wales  beat Scotland 24-6 in Edinburgh.  Leader England and France both have four points after two
rounds of games. Wales and Ireland have two, and Scotland and
Italy have yet to score.  To contact the reporter on this story:
