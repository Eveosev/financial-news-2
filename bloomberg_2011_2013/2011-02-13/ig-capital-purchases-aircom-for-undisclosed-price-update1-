HIG Capital LLC, the Miami-based
private-equity company, purchased mobile-phone services provider
 Aircom International Group  from buyout firm Advent International
Corp. for an undisclosed price.    Barclays Plc  and  HSBC Holdings Plc  provided a “joint debt
package” to Aircom, which has customers in 135 countries,  HIG 
said in a statement today. The firm paid 100 million pounds
($160 million) for Aircom, the Sunday Times reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Aircom may have sales of more than 90 million pounds in the
year through June 2011, HIG said. The Leatherhead, England-based
company, under Chief Executive Officer Darryl Edwards, has
helped phone companies from Vodafone Group Plc to KPN NV to
improve network coverage and quality, its website shows.  “We look forward to supporting the management, and we
believe that we can bring added firepower and support for their
ambitious growth plans,” Paul Canning, managing director at
HIG’s Europe unit, said in the statement.  Advent International, located in Boston, invested in Aircom
in October 2005, according to its website.  HIG, which has more than 6 billion pounds of equity capital
under management, said it expects to make further transaction
announcements in the next few months.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Michael Patterson  in  London  at
