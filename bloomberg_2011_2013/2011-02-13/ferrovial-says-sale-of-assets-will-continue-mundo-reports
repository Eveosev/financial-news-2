  Ferrovial SA  Chairman Rafael Del Pino said the disposal of assets will be an “ongoing” process
besides the 10 percent stake in BAA Ltd. already for sale,  El
Mundo  reported, citing an interview.  Ferrovial will “take a project, develop it and sell it”
because the initial stage of projects is where the company can
provide “more value” to its shareholders, Del Pino was quoted
as saying by the Spanish newspaper.  He added that the company doesn’t have any conflict in the
U.K. at the moment, El Mundo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
