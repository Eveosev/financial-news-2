Austria’s Elisabeth Goergl secured
her second gold medal of the FIS Alpine Ski World Championships,
taking today’s downhill ahead of Lindsey Vonn of the U.S.  Goergl, who claimed the super-G event on Feb. 8, clocked 1
minute, 47.24 seconds down the Kandahar course at Garmisch-
Partenkirchen, Germany, 0.44 second ahead of Olympic champion
Vonn.  Germany ’s Maria Riesch was third.  “I really hadn’t expected this win,” Goergl told the
competition’s  official website . “I had been very strained
before the beginning. I had still been very nervous when we
inspected the slope.”  Austria has dominated the women’s events this week, with
Anna Fenninger taking the super-combined title two days ago. The
championships run until Feb. 20, with the next event the men’s
super-combined tomorrow.  Vonn, who suffered a concussion in training 10 days ago,
said she was “more than satisfied” with second spot. Riesch
has also been struggling, trying to overcome flu.  To contact the reporter on this story:  James Cone  in London at
