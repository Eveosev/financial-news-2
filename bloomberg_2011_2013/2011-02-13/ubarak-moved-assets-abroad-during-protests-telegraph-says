Former Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  moved assets into untraceable accounts abroad during the
18 days of protests before his resignation, the Sunday Telegraph
reported, citing unidentified intelligence sources.  Mubarak may have accumulated more than 3 billion pounds
($4.8 billion) over his 30-year reign, according to the
newspaper. Financial advisers to the Mubarak family tried to
move some of these assets beyond the reach of investigators to
Gulf states, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
