Niger ’s transitional parliament said
it approved a draft law committing political parties and the
army to ensure good governance and an equitable distribution of
wealth in the world’s sixth-biggest uranium producer.  “This agreement will bring together all the efforts for
the nation and national development in order to avoid political
and social crises,” Marou Amadou, the president of the 132-
member National Advisory Council, told reporters yesterday in
Niamey, the capital.  The so-called Republican Pact law will be sent to the
ruling military junta for approval before a presidential runoff
election scheduled for March 12. The ballot is a key part of the
West African nation’s bid to restore civilian rule following the
army’s February 2010 ouster of President Mamadou Tandja, who
attempted to change the constitution and abolish presidential  term limits .  The runoff will pit Mahamadou Issoufou of the Parti
Nigerien pour la Democratie et le Socialisme, who won 36.1
percent of votes in the first round this month, against Seini
Oumarou, the candidate of Tandja’s party, who won 23.2 percent.  Landlocked Niger is among the world’s poorest countries.
Hard hit by famine in 2009 and 2010, it ranks above only  Zimbabwe  and the Democratic Republic of Congo on the United
Nations’ Human Development Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
