  National Express Group Plc  has not
been asked by Elliott Management, which holds 16 percent in the
company, to put itself up for sale and to explore an alliance
with Stagecoach Group Plc or Societe Nationale des Chemins de
Fer Francais, the French state-owned rail operator, the Daily
Telegraph reported, citing  National Express  Chief Executive
Officer Dean Finch.  Finch meets Elliott Management each quarter and National
Express has “had no complaints about either the company’s
strategy or its management,” the newspaper reported, citing
Finch.  Calls to National Express outside of business hours weren’t
immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
