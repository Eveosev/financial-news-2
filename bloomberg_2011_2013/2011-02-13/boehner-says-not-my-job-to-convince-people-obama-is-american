Republican House Speaker  John Boehner , saying he accepts that President  Barack Obama  is a
Christian who was born in Hawaii, said he feels no
responsibility to correct people who believe Obama is a Muslim
born outside the U.S.  “It’s not my job to tell the American people what to
think,” Boehner said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” program today.
“Our job here in Washington is to listen to the American
people.”  “Having said that, the state of Hawaii said he was born
there -- that’s good enough for me.” the Ohio lawmaker said.
“The president says he’s a Christian. I accept him at his
word.”  Obama, a Democrat, has blamed “a network of
misinformation” for misperceptions about his birthplace and his
religious beliefs. A Pew Research Center  poll  last August found
that almost one-in-five respondents believed Obama is a Muslim.  To contact the reporter on this story:
