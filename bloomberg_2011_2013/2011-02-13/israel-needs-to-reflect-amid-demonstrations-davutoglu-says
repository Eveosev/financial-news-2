  Israel  is the Middle East country
most in need of reflection as demonstrations break out across
the region, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said in an
interview with broadcaster  CNN-Turk .  “At the top of the list of countries that need to
criticize themselves is Israel,” which is moving toward
isolation, he said. Arab countries are now aware that they have
a common destiny, according to the minister.  Davutoglu spoke before a state visit to Iran today. He was
replying to questions as to whether protests against longtime
presidents in Tunisia and  Egypt  might spread to other countries.  “A regional consciousness has begun to emerge,” he said.
“This is the start of a historic change.”  Davutoglu also said  Iran  can’t be compared with Tunisia or
Egypt because it has a more “dynamic political structure,”
with different groups in competition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
