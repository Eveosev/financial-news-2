Escalating political tensions in  Italy  may put the “continuity” of current legislation “at
risk,” President Giorgio Napolitano said, according to an e-
mailed statement yesterday.  Napolitano indicated a risk of early elections after an
intensification in political rallies stemming from sex scandals
involving Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi . Milan prosecutors on
Feb. 9 filed a formal request for Berlusconi to stand trial for
alleged abuse of power and paying a minor for sex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
