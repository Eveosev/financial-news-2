  National Express  Group Plc
shareholder Elliott Management wants the transport group to put
itself up for sale, the Sunday Times reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Elliott International raised its holding in National
Express to 16.2915 percent of voting rights on Feb. 1, according
to a London Stock Exchange filing.  National Express management rejected Elliottâ€™s request for
a sale and has no plans for a merger, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
