World Trade Organization members
engaged in the Doha round of trade talks agree on about 80
percent of the issues, and the remainder are solvable,  Pascal Lamy , director general of the organization, told  Le Matin .  Lamy said he is neither an optimist nor a pessimist on the
talks, and rather an “activist,” according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
