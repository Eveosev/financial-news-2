  Amlin Plc , a Lloyd’s of London
insurer, would consider moving its operations overseas if U.K.
regulators were to introduce too onerous regulatory requirements
in 2013, the Telegraph reported, citing an interview with Chief
Executive Officer Charles Philipps.  Any “gold-plating” of the European Union’s Solvency II
capital requirements could “render operating from the U.K. less
competitive,” and a rise in costs or capital requirements would
“force a review” of where the company is located, Philipps
said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
