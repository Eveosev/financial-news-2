  Renta 4 SA  has no plans to engage in
commercial banking after agreeing to buy Banco Alicantino de
Comercio SA from Banco Espanol de Credito SA,  El Pais  reported.  The newspaper cited an interview with Renta 4 Chairman Juan Carlos Ureta. The Spanish securities firm agreed this month to
buy the bank for 15 million euros ($20 million) to improve
client services while continuing with its business model of
providing “investment services,” he said, according to El
Pais.  Ureta predicted little financial effect from the
acquisition on this year’s results and stuck to a goal of
reaching double-digit revenue growth, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
