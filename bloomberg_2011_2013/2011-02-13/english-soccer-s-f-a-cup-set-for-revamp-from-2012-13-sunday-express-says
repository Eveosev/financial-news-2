English soccer’s F.A. Cup is set for
a revamp from the 2012-13 season, which may include a spot in
the Champions League for the winner and the scrapping of
replays, the Sunday Express reported.   The Football Association “think-tank” is looking at ways
to reinvigorate the competition after a drop in crowds, the
newspaper said, citing an unidentified “insider.”.  Games may be moved to midweek and the final scheduled at
5:30 p.m. on a Saturday instead of its current 3 p.m. slot, the
Express added.  The changes would be introduced to coincide with the start
of a new television broadcasting agreement, the newspaper
reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
