The idea that banks slowed lending
during the U.S. recession is a “huge misconception,”  JPMorgan
Chase & Co . Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon 
said.  Any lending slowdown was a result of reduced demand for
capital from businesses and consumers, Dimon said in a Jan. 27
interview broadcast today on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS.” Dimon
said his bank loaned $1.4 trillion to corporations and
individuals worldwide in 2010, “up pretty substantially” from
2009.  “We are lending aggressively to corporate, to middle
market,” he said. “If you talk to most economists, there is a
demand issue. A lot of people don’t need the money.”  Dimon said the banking industry in the U.S. is “far less
concentrated” than in Europe or Asia, and that JPMorgan could
fail without putting the nation’s financial system at risk. The
nation should create a process Dimon called “minimally damaging
bankruptcy for big, dumb banks” to unwind troubled institutions
such as Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Dimon defended his bank’s lobbying against President Barack Obama’s financial regulation overhaul.  “We fought the parts of the reform we thought were
irrational,” he said. JPMorgan supports “oversight
committees” for the financial system, clearing houses for
trading in derivatives, and “better consumer protection,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
