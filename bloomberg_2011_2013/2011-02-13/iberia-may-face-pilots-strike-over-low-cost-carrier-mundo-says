  Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA 
may face a strike by pilots after failing to reach an agreement
on how to create its low-cost airline,  El Mundo  reported, citing
people close to the company it didn’t identify.  Spain’s biggest airline, which merged with  British Airways
Plc  last month to create International Consolidated Airlines
Group SA, needs to introduce a low-cost carrier for short- and
medium-haul flights in Spain and Europe in order to cut
expenses, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
