The U.K. Serious Fraud Office is
searching for cash and assets held by former Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  and his family, the Sunday Times reported, without
saying where it got the information.  A Belgravia-based private equity firm with links to
Mubarakâ€™s sons Gamal and Alaa is among the assets being
investigated by the SFO, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
