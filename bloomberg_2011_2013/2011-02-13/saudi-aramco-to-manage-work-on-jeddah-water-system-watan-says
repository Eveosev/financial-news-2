  Saudi Aramco , the world’s biggest
oil company, will manage construction of a water drainage system
planned for  Saudi Arabia ’s second-largest city, Jeddah, to make
the port less vulnerable to floods, al-Watan reported.  The Abha-based newspaper cited the governor of the Mecca
region, Prince Khalid al-Faisal, as saying the government has
invited more than ten international companies to help design the
network. The governor expects the companies to respond within
two weeks, al-Watan reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
