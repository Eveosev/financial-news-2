  ThyssenKrupp AG  is facing production
constraints at a new steel plant in Brazil over capacity curbs
imposed by local environmental authorities,  Wirtschaftswoche 
reported, citing an unidentified company director.  The plant is currently running at 70 percent of capacity,
though increased graphite and iron dust emissions have led
authorities to limit capacity to 60 percent, the magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
