Bendigo & Adelaide Bank Ltd., an
Australian regional lender, said first-half profit jumped 67
percent as interest income increased.  Net income in the six months ended Dec. 31 rose to A$173.9
million ($173.9 million) from A$104.1 million in the same period
a year earlier, the bank said in a statement today. That beat a
forecast by Credit Suisse Group AG analysts including James Ellis for profit of A$153.7 million.  Bendigo & Adelaide, a 153-year-old bank that last year
purchased Rural Bank to expand lending to farmers, faces waning
credit demand and potential fallout from floods in Queensland
and Victoria states, according to Citigroup Inc. analysts Wes Nason and  Craig Williams . That’s being offset by higher interest
income, after banks led by  Commonwealth Bank of Australia 
boosted borrowing costs more than the central bank in November.  “We believe the market has underplayed the earnings risk
from the recent Australian flood disaster and Cyclone Yasi,”
Nason and Williams said ahead of today’s earnings. They have a
“sell” rating on Bendigo & Adelaide’s stock. The bank may also
struggle to maintain its current dividend payout, they said.  Bendigo & Adelaide’s shares have lagged behind larger
rivals this year, gaining 2 percent. Commonwealth Bank has
climbed 8.6 percent and National  Australia  Bank Ltd. has added
8.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
