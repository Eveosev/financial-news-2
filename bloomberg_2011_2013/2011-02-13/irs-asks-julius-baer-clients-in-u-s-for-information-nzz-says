The Internal Revenue Service has
asked U.S. citizens for information about accounts at  Julius
Baer Group Ltd . and  Basler Kantonalbank ,  Neue Zuercher Zeitung 
said, citing Scott Michel, a lawyer at Caplin & Drysdale.  Caplin & Drysdale represented 350 of 15,000 people who
participated in an amnesty program for undeclared offshore bank
accounts, the newspaper said.  Julius Baer is not aware of any investigation, Jan Vonder Muehll, a spokesman for the bank, told Bloomberg News. Michael
Buess, a spokesman for Basler Kantonalbank, didnâ€™t immediately
respond to an e-mail outside of regular office hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
