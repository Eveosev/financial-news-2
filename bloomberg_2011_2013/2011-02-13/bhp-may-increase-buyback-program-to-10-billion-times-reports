  BHP Billiton Ltd . may buyback shares
valued at $5 billion to $6 billion, which would bring the total
value of shares bought back to around $10 billion, the Sunday
Times reported, without saying where it got the information.  The mining company is likely to report profit for the first
six months of $10.2 million, the newspaper said, up from $5.7
million in the same period a year earlier. BHP will report
first-half results on Feb. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
