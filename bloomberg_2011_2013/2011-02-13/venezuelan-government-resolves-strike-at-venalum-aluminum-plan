State-run aluminum company CVG
Industria Venezolana de Aluminio CA began full operations again
last night after a strike was resolved, Mining Minister Jose Khan said.  About 350 workers at Venalum, as the company is known,
returned to work at 10:30 p.m. New York time last night, Khan
said. The government agreed to meet with workers tomorrow to
continue discussing labor issues, he said. The strike left the
plant functioning at minimum capacity for about a week.  “We’ve had more than six meetings, we’ve had some lengthy
discussions and even though there were some disagreements, our
government managed to resolve this problem with no aggression
toward the workers,” Khan said in comments carried on state
television.  About 500 workers had continued working during the strike
to ensure the factory retained a minimum level of functionality,
Khan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
