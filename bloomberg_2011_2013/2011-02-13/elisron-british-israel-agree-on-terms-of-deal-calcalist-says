Melisron Ltd. and British-Israel
Investments Ltd. have agreed on the terms of Melisronâ€™s
acquisition of British-Israel, the financial daily Calcalist
said today, without saying where it got the information. The
sides are no longer in need of an arbitrator who was chosen
earlier this month to resolve the dispute between them, it
added.                          A message left at Melisron
before office hours was not immediately answered. Calls to
British-Israel, also before office hours, were not immediately
answered.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
