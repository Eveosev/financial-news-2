A package of laws opposed by  Turkey ’s unions has passed after more than two and a half months
of debate, the state-run Anatolia news agency reported.  The legislation includes 234 measures dealing mostly with
reforms to state salaries, tax liabilities, social security and
health insurance, Anatolia said. The country’s parliament in
Ankara approved the package last night, it said.  The ruling  Justice and Development Party  added a last-
minute law that forgives most of a fine imposed on former Prime
Minister Necmettin Erbakan, founder of the Islamist-leaning
Welfare Party,  Milliyet  newspaper reported.  Erbakan was convicted in 2002 of embezzling funds that the
Treasury gave to his party. The new, temporary law reduces the
penalty against him from 12.5 million liras ($7.9 million) to
about 1 million liras, payable in installments over 18 months,
Milliyet reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
