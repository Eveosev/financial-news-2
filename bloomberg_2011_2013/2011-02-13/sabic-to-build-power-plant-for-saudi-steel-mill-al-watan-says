  Saudi Basic Industries Corp ., or
Sabic, the world’s largest petrochemicals maker, plans to build
a power plant to provide electricity to its steel plant at
Jubail in eastern Saudi Arabia, al-Watan reported.  The Saudi newspaper reported that Sabic wants to cut energy
costs at the mill, citing an unidentified source at the
petrochemical company’s steel unit, which is known as Hadeed.
The source told the  newspaper  that feasibility studies for the
generating plant are finished, though Sabic faces a problem
getting enough natural gas from  Saudi Aramco , the country’s
state-run oil company, to fuel the plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
