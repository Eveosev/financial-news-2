Codelco’s Andina mine in central  Chile  is operating normally after heavy rainfall and landslides
prevented workers from reaching the site Feb. 11, an official at
the state-owned company said today.  The official, who had been briefed on the matter, declined
to be identified, citing company policy.  The mine has been operating normally since 2 p.m. New York
time yesterday, the official said. It had closed after the
workers were unable to start their shift at 10 p.m. on Feb. 11.  The Andina mine is 3,700 to 4,200 meters above sea level in
the Andes mountains, 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of
Santiago. It produces 210,000 tons of copper concentrate a year
and was Chile’s seventh-largest mine in 2008, according to data
from the country’s copper commission.  Chile is the world’s biggest producer of the metal, used in
pipes and wires. Copper accounts for more than half the
country’s exports.  To contact the reporter responsible on this story:
