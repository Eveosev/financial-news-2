The Egyptian Museum reported that 18
artifacts, including statues of King Tutankhamun, are missing
after a break-in last month, said  Zahi Hawass , the head of the
Supreme Council of Antiquities.  The police and army are following up on the disappearances
with people in custody, Hawass said on his  website.  The missing
objects include 11 wooden shabti statuettes from Yuya, a gilded
wooden statue of Tutankhamun carried by a goddess and a statue
of Nefertiti making offerings, according to Hawass.  A separate gilded wooden statue of Tutankhamun harpooning,
a limestone statue of Akhenaten holding an offering table, a
sandstone head of an Amarna princess, a stone statuette of a
scribe from Amarna and a heart scarab of Yuya are also missing
from the museum in Cairo, Hawass said in his blog.  Intruders used ropes to descend from the museum’s roof and
force their way inside from a fire escape, Hawass said Jan. 30.
They broke open 14 display cases in the museum’s Late Period and
Tutankhamun exhibits, in search of gold. Finding none, they
shattered statues, including one of the ancient goddess Isis,
and smashed some of the museum’s royal mummies, he said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
