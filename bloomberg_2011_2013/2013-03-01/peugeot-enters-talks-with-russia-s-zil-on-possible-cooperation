PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) , Europe’s
second-biggest carmaker, confirmed it is talking with Russian
manufacturer  AMO ZIL (ZILL)  about the possibility of cooperating as the
French company plans to boost sales in the country.  “We’re in talks with them,” Jean-Baptiste Thomas, a
Peugeot spokesman, said by phone. “But they’re just one among
many interlocutors we’re talking to, in Russia and elsewhere,”
Thomas said, declining to reveal more details of the talks.  Russian newspaper Vedomosti reported today that the talks
are about the possibility of the companies assembling vehicles
together. ZIL may start to assemble Peugeot and Citroen light
commercial vehicles, Vedomosti reported, citing a person
familiar with the matter.  As Peugeot is struggling with overcapacity and falling
revenue in Europe, it plans to increase sales in  emerging
markets  such as Russia. The Paris-based automaker, which
reported a 576 million-euro ($749 million) operating loss for
2012, aims to sell more than 50 percent of its vehicles outside
Europe by 2015.  The Russian car market is projected to surpass  Germany  in
volume by 2017, researcher IHS Automotive said today. The
prospects for the country prompted Renault SA, Volkswagen AG,
Ford Motor Co. and other carmakers to expand capacity. General
Motors Co. and Russian partner GAZ Group started ramping up
production last month of 30,000 Chevrolet Aveos a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
