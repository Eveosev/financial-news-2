Cinedigm Digital Cinema Corp. (CIDM) , a
company that provides theaters with digital projection, advanced
the most in more than six months after announcing $195 million
in new credit facilities to reduce borrowing costs.  The stock gained 9.5 percent, or 13 cents, to $1.50 at the
close in  New York , the biggest one-day jump since Aug. 20. The
shares have risen 7.1 percent this year,  while  the Nasdaq
Composite Index has added 5 percent.  Cinedigm, which has a library of 5,000 titles, is
diversifying beyond financing digital conversions with ventures
to transmit live entertainment in theaters and distribute
independent films to cinemas and home-video services. The new
financing will lower borrowing costs, Cinedigmâ€™s Chief Executive
Officer Chris McGurk said in a statement.  The debt will be secured by fees Cinedigm earns from
cinemas for converting theaters to digital projection from film,
the company said.  The refinancing includes a $125 million credit facility led
by Societe Generale Corporate & Investment Banking and $70
million from  Prospect Capital Corp. (PSEC) , according to the statement.  The two facilities replace existing debt and lower the
initial average borrowing costs by as much as 3 percent, the
company said.  Cinedigm, with a market value of about $75 million, has
seen its shares drop from a peak of $14.59 in May 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
