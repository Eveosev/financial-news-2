(Corrects to most-decorated Premier League player in fourth paragraph.)  Manchester United midfielder Ryan Giggs signed a one-year contract extension to return for a 23rd season, the Premier League club said on its website.  The 39-year-old has appeared in a club-record 931 games, scoring 168 goals, since making his United debut on March 2, 1991. His new deal runs until June 2014.  “What can I say about Ryan that hasn’t already been said?” United manager Alex Ferguson said in a  statement . “He is a marvelous player and an exceptional human being. Ryan is an example to us all the way in which he has, and continues to, look after himself.”  Giggs is the most decorated player in Premier League history, having won 12 league titles. He’s also captured four F.A. Cups, three League Cups, and two Champions League titles.  The Welshman has scored five goals in 22 matches this season in helping United to a 12-point lead in the Premier League. The club has also reached the quarterfinals of the F.A. Cup and the round of 16 in the Champions League.  “I am feeling good, enjoying my football more than ever and, most importantly, I feel I am making a contribution to the team,” Giggs said. “This is an exciting team to be part of, with great team spirit, and we are again pushing for trophies as we head toward the business end of the season.”  Giggs has scored in each of his 23 seasons in the top division and is the only player to have at least one goal in each of the Premier League’s 21 campaigns. His next appearance will be the 1,000th of his career playing for United, the Wales national team and the British Olympic team.
