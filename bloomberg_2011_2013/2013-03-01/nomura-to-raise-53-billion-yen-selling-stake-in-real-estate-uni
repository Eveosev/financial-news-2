Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) ,  Japan ’s
biggest brokerage, will sell a stake in its real estate unit for
about 53 billion yen ($572 million) to concentrate on areas
where it can leverage strengths amid stricter banking rules.  The investment bank will reduce its holding in  Nomura Real
Estate Holdings Inc. (3231)  to 36 percent from 51 percent through a
secondary offering by its Nomura Land and Building Co. unit,
Nomura said in a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange today.  Nomura is among global financial firms that are selling
assets to raise cash and focus on their banking operations as
regulators tighten capital and liquidity requirements. The
Tokyo-based bank’s sale of Annington Homes Ltd., a U.K. housing
estate company, helped net income climb 13 percent to 20.1
billion yen in the quarter ended December.  Shares of Nomura rose 1.7 percent to 541 yen at 1:11 p.m.
in  Tokyo . Nomura Real Estate rose 2.6 percent to 1,708 yen.
Based on the closing  price  yesterday, the 32 million shares to
be offered, including an over-allotment, are valued at 53.3
billion yen. The stake would fall below 36 percent if the extra
shares are sold.  Paring the stake will make Nomura Real Estate an affiliate
rather than a subsidiary, according to the statement. The firms
will “continue to pursue growth through expanding their
respective businesses and collaborating together,” Nomura said.  The sale will be priced on March 12 or 13, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
