Codelco will maintain a record pace
of  investments  to preserve its status as the world’s biggest
copper producer while pledging debt-market prudence to retain
its credit ratings and contain borrowing costs.  Chile ’s state-owned miner will spend more than $5 billion
this year, up from last year’s $4.2 billion as part of a plan to
reach annual output of 2.25 million metric tons by 2021, Chief
Executive Office  Thomas Keller  told reporters in Santiago.  Codelco plans to begin mining at its Hales project in
October and will seek approval this year to expand the Andina
mine in central Chile, Keller said today. The company is also
beginning to tunnel underneath the century-old Chuquicamata mine
to access new deposits as ore-grades decline.  While companies face “attractive” market conditions to
raise money, Codelco will be “prudent” in selling bonds to
prevent credit rating changes, Keller said. The Santiago-based
company will use profit and tap bond markets to help finance
this year’s capital expenditures, he said, without elaborating.  Codelco is rated A by  Standard & Poor’s , making it the
second-highest rated major mining company behind  BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BHP)   As mining companies in Chile delay some of the more than
$100 billion in planned investment amid electricity shortages,
Codelco will rethink its proposed expansion at the Salvador
mine. The current project doesn’t meet company profit criteria,
Keller said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
