  Koninklijke Ten Cate NV (KTC) , the maker
for soldier protective clothing, reported a 19 percent decline
in profit amid reductions in U.S.  defense spending .  Profit last year was 22.3 million euros ($29 million)
compared with 58.7 million euros a year earlier, the Almelo,
Netherlands-based company said in a statement today. Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg estimated 31 million euros.  “The unexpectedly sharp decrease in sales in the U.S.
defense market resulted in a significant reduction in the sales
of Ten Cate Defender-M and the armor portfolio,” Chief
Executive Officer and President Loek de Vries. U.S. elections
and a budget standoff in  Washington  last year “had a major
impact on the performance of the group as a whole.”  Cost cuts could not offset the sharp decline in sales, de
Vries said in the statement. The company is cutting staff to
adjust to reduced demand with 15 million euros in personnel-
related restructuring costs last year.  Ten Cate said it also suffered delays in deliveries on a
contract for the Airbus SAS A350 deliveries, impinging on the
otherwise “positive picture” in its aerospace activities.  The board proposed a dividend of of 0.50 euros, compared
with 0.95 euros a year-prior, as sales declined 8 percent to 1
billion euros.  Ten Cate shares have declined 7 percent this year, closing
yesterday at 18.5 euros in trading in Amsterdam valuing the
business at 489.8 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
