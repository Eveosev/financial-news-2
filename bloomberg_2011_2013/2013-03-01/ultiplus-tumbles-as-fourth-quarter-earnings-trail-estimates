Multiplus SA (MPLU3) , the frequent-flier
unit of Latam Airlines Group SA’s Brazil subsidiary, dropped for
the first time in three days after reporting fourth-quarter net
income that trailed analysts’ estimates.  Shares fell 1.8 percent to 36.20 reais at 11:21 a.m. in Sao
Paulo after tumbling as much as 3.4 percent. Multiplus pared its
gain this week to 1 percent. The stock declined the most on the
 MSCI Brazil Industrials Index (MXBR0IN) , which slid 0.6 percent.  Sao Paulo-based Multiplus reported fourth-quarter net
income of 52.9 million reais ($26.6 million), according to a
regulatory filing yesterday after the close of trading. That
 compares  with 70.9 million reais a year earlier. The average
estimate of nine analysts was for adjusted net income of 59.8
million reais.  “The decline is clearly negative for the company,”
Bradesco BBI analysts including Carlos Firetti wrote in a
research note published today. Billings to TAM, Latam’s Brazil
subsidiary, reached a record low share, the analysts wrote.  Multiplus has dropped 25 percent since this year’s high
reached on Jan. 3, while the Bovespa benchmark index has
declined 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
