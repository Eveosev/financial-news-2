The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
increased, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 1 basis point to 108.5 basis points
as of 8:26 a.m. in Hong Kong, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The gauge, which has ranged from 102.8 to 120.3
since Dec. 31, is poised to decline for a fourth-consecutive
week, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose half a basis point
to 115 as of 10:38 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp. prices
show. The benchmark is set to rise for the first time in three
days, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index also increased half a basis
point to 125 basis points as of 9:13 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Deutsche Bank AG prices. The measure, which started the year at
148.1, declined for a fifth straight month in February, CMA
prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
