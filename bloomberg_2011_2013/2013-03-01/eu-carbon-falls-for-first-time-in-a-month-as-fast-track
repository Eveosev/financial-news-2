EU carbon permit prices posted their
first weekly decline in more than a month after lawmakers
rejected speeding up a plan to tackle the market’s oversupply.  Allowances for December dropped 4.7 percent to close at
4.67 euros ($6.08) a metric ton on London’s ICE Futures  Europe ,
10 percent lower than a week earlier. The contract’s last weekly
decline came in the five days ending Jan. 25.  The European Parliament’s environment committee approved
last week a plan by the European Commission, the bloc’s
regulator, to delay the sale of 900 million tons of permits in
the next three years, and redistribute it in 2019 and 2020. At a
Feb. 25 meeting it didn’t agree a mandate to start accelerated
negotiations on the proposal with  member states .  United Nations Certified Emission Reductions for March had
their biggest-ever weekly increase even as supply next month was
set to jump more than six times to the second most since the
market started. CERs rose 11 percent to 24 euro cents a ton. The
contract gained 71 percent from a week earlier.  The UN is  scheduled  to supply nearly 61 million offsets in
the next four weeks, after creating the fewest for two years in
February, according to UN data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
