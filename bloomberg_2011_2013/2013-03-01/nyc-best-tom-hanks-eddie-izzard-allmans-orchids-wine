debut.  In previews at the Broadhurst Theatre, 235 W. 44th St., for
an April 1 opening. Information: +1-212-239-6200;

 Carnegie Hall  under the baton of Franz Welser-Most.  Tonight hear Dvorak’s Symphony No. 7, and tenor Herbert
Lippert singing rapturous Strauss lieder.  At Carnegie Hall, 7th Ave. and 57th St. Information: +1-

some biggies boast 10-foot-long flower spikes.  You’ll see tens of thousands of blooms arrayed among palms,
ferns, bromeliads and epiphytic cacti.  Runs through April 22 at the  New York  Botanical Garden,

where he’s trying out material for “Force Majeure,” his

and Isaac story, nor make contemporary audiences laugh at King
Richard the Lionheart.  Note: You can bring in liquid refreshment.  The Green Room at 45 Bleecker St. Information: +1-212-260-

the Garden” you can see his delight in the magnificent dresses.  Artists regarded the pleats, chokers and slippers of high
fashion as emblems of the modern, which they were rushing to
capture.  A new show at the Met brings together the gowns and the
great paintings of 19th century Paris, many of which rarely
travel to the U.S., as well as accessories, photographs and
prints.  “Impressionism, Fashion and Modernity” runs through May
27 at the  Metropolitan Museum  of Art, 1000 Fifth Ave.

where he collected painters such as Watteau, Canaletto and
Rembrandt. He also held read-throughs of his works there,
inviting patrons and friends to hear his latest compositions.  The virtuosic Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra presents “House
of Dreams,” a multimedia recreation of Handel’s intimate
concerts.  You’ll visit four other virtual homes to hear the music of
Bach, Vivaldi, Marais and Telemann in the cities and
circumstances where they were first performed.  Presented by Miller Theater at the  American Academy  of Arts
& Letters, 632 W. 156th St. Information: +1-212-854-7799;
