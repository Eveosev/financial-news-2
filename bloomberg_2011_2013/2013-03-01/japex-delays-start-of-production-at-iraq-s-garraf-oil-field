Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. (1662) , the
country’s second-biggest oil and gas explorer, and its partners
have delayed the start of production in the Garraf oil field in
southern  Iraq  by six months to June.  Production was scheduled for the end of 2012, according to
the Japanese explorer’s latest  annual report . The delay was
caused by issues including Iraq’s poor infrastructure, said a
company official who asked not to be identified in line with
internal policy.  The company known as Japex expects initial production of
60,000 barrels a day, rising to 230,000 barrels a day in 2017,
President Osamu Watanabe said yesterday.  Japex and Petroliam Nasional Bhd., the Malaysian state oil
company known as Petronas, won a $7 billion contract to develop
the Garraf field in 2009. Iraq is expected to more than double
its oil production output to 6.1 million barrels a day by 2020,
the  International Energy Agency  said in October.  Petronas owns 45 percent of the project, a Japex subsidiary
30 percent and Iraq’s North Oil Company has the rest, according
to Japex’s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
