Moisture levels in  Russia ’s Volga
region, which produced about 20 percent of the national crop
this season, may improve this month on above-average
precipitation.  Seven of 13 areas in the Volga Federal District will have
precipitation of 10 percent to 30 percent above the norm, the
state weather forecast center said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. The other six areas will have normal or close to
normal levels, the forecaster’s data show. The average
precipitation level is 19 millimeters to 32 millimeters (0.7
inch to 1.3 inches) depending on the area. The center didn’t
specify whether the precipitation will take the form of rains or
snowfall or both.  The Volga area was causing concern before the spring sowing
campaign, which usually starts at the end of March or in early
April, because soil was still dry after last year’s drought,
chief forecaster  Alexander Frolov  said on Feb. 14.  Precipitation will also exceed the norm by as much as 35
percent in the Ural and Siberian Federal Districts and will be
close to normal in the Southern Federal District in March, the
center said. Average temperatures will be close to average
across grain-producing regions, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
