The Canadian dollar rose from the
lowest level in eight months against its U.S. counterpart after
a report showed the economy expanded in the fourth quarter.  Gross domestic product grew at a 0.6 percent annualized
pace from October to December, the slowest since the second
quarter of 2011,  Statistics Canada  said today from Ottawa. The
quarter ended with a 0.2 percent decline in output in December,
led by manufacturers and retailers.  “The Canadian GDP is a sign  Canada  entered the year on a
strong footing,” Adam Button, a currency analyst at
Forexlive.com, said by telephone from  Montreal  before the
release. “But we’re already into March and these numbers are
already deep in the rear-view mirror, so I don’t believe it will
derail the Canadian dollar’s trajectory towards last year’s
lows.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the water fowl on the C$1 coin, fell 0.2 percent to C$1.0323
per U.S. dollar at 8:34 a.m. in Toronto. Earlier it touched
C$1.0342 per  U.S. dollar , it’s weakest since June. One loonie
buys 96.87 U.S. cents.  The Canadian dollar’s lowest point last year was C$1.0447
per U.S. dollar on June 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
