Hungary’s purchasing managers’ index
declined in February, indicating that the expansion in
manufacturing slowed as the country struggled to emerge from
recession.  The PMI, as reported by the purchasing managers of 100
manufacturing companies, fell to 54 points in February, from
55.9 in January, MLBKT, the company which compiles the data,
said in a report today.  The PMI index is a weighted average of five indexes: new
orders, production volume, employment, transportation time, and
purchased inventory. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction
in output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
