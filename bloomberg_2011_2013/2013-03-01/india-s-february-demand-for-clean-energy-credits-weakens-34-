Demand for renewable-energy credits
in  India  declined 34 percent in February from the previous month
as regulators failed to enforce clean-energy targets for
companies.  Credits sold for 1,500 rupees ($27) each, the floor price
set by the regulator, according to  REConnect Energy Solutions
Pvt ., an Indore-based trader said. Of the total 2 million
renewable credits available in the market, REConnect recorded a
total 153,629 bids for solar and non-solar credits.  “Regulators and regulations continue to lose relevance as
demand continues to dip,” said Vibhav Nuwal, a director at
REConnect Energy Solutions.  The Indian government requires companies including state-
run power distributors,  Coal India Ltd. (COAL) , Oil & Natural Gas
Corp.,  Tata Power Co. (TPWR)  and other large power consumers to buy as
much as 10 percent of their electricity every year from
renewables. Those unable to obtain enough clean power locally
can meet their target by purchasing credits from the country’s
two power exchanges. They’re sold by wind and solar farms as
well as hydropower and biomass plants.  Each credit represents one megawatt-hour of clean
electricity fed into the grid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
