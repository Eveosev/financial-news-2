Klaipedos Nafta AB (KNF1L) , Lithuania’s
state-controlled energy terminal operator, is close to resolving
all remaining issues related to finances and public tenders for
a new natural-gas terminal on the Baltic Sea.  “Signing contracts soon with builders of a jetty and a
pipeline link should ensure we can start up the terminal by late
2014,” Klaipedos Nafta Chief Executive Officer Rokas Masiulis
told reporters today in Vilnius, the capital.  Lithuania is building the floating liquefied natural-gas
terminal to diversify its gas imports and reduce reliance on
 Russia ’s OAO Gazprom. Cash from the company’s profitable oil
business will help pay for the roughly $800 million LNG project,
alongside a February overdraft deal with Nordea Bank AB and
long-term loans from international lenders, Masiulis said.  Klaipedos Nafta today said it selected AS BMGS of Latvia to
build on-shore infrastructure for the terminal for 94 million
litai ($35 million) plus value-added tax. Revised final bids in
a tender to build a 20-kilometer (21.8-mile) pipeline linking
the terminal to Lithuania’s gas grid are due on March 6,
according to Masiulis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
