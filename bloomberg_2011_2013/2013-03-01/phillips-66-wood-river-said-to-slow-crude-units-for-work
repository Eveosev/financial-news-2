Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Wood River,  Illinois ,
refinery has cut rates at two crude distillation units for
planned work, a person familiar with the turnaround said.  The plant ’s 120,000-barrel-a-day distillation unit is shut,
while production from a 150,000-barrel-a-day unit will be cut by
half for the next seven to 10 days, said the person, who asked
not to be identified because the information isn’t public.  A third unit, which can process about 60,000 barrels of
crude a day, is operating at full rates. Work will be performed
on that equipment for six days in late March, the person said.  Rich Johnson, a company spokesman, declined to comment on
operations in an e-mail. Johnson said Feb. 26 that planned
maintenance at the refinery was under way.  Planned work was also expected on a hydrocracker from late
February to late March, a diesel hydrotreater and delayed coker
for six days each in March and two desulfurization units for a
combined 24 days, the person said Jan. 23.  The Wood River refinery, 15 miles northeast of St. Louis,
can process as much as 356,000 barrels of crude oil a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s a joint venture of
Phillips and  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE)   To contact the reporter on this story:
