Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.16 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.04 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.04 percent to 0.16 percent and averaging 0.14 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will acquire $750 million to $1 billion
Treasuries maturing from August 2023 to February 2031. The
transactions are part of the Fed’s latest round of debt
purchases, known as quantitative easing, aimed to keep long-term
rates low and support economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
