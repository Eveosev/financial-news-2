Jefferies Group Inc. cut its
forecast for European Union 2013 carbon permits by 13 percent as
the bloc seeks a solution to an excess of the allowances that
forced prices to a record low last month.  The contract will average 5 euros ($6.49) a metric ton
through December,  Matthew Gray , a London-based carbon analyst,
wrote in an e-mailed research note today, lowering its estimate
from 5.75 euros. The permits will trade at 6.50 euros a ton by
expiry at the end of this year, he said, cutting a previous
forecast of 8 euros.  EU permits for December fell 2.2 percent to 4.79 euros at
2:43 p.m. on London’s ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. They dropped
to a record 2.81 euros Jan. 24.  The European Parliament’s environment committee last month
approved a plan from the bloc’s regulator to withhold 900
million tons of allowances over the next three years and
redistribute them in 2019-2020. The panel rejected a bid to
negotiate the proposal in a fast-track procedure, which may
delay the approval of the so-called backloading plan by two
months.  “We are still confident that  Germany  will vote in favor of
backloading,” Matthew Gray, a carbon analyst at Jefferies, said
in an e-mailed report today. “But due to their hegemonic status
in Europe, German approval will likely be conditional. For this
reason, EUA volume being delayed in 2013 seems unlikely.”  The surplus of permits in the EU emissions trading system
in 2012 will rise nearly 70 percent from a year earlier to 1.6
billion tons, Gray said. That’s equivalent to 87 percent of the
cap on emissions last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  2012 Emissions  Factories and power stations within the EU emissions-
trading system emitted 1.88 billion tons of carbon last year, up
0.6 percent from 2011, Gray said in the research note. Bloomberg
New Energy Finance predicts 2012 emissions of 1.96 billion tons.
Preliminary data will be published in April.  The increase is because it’s more profitable to burn coal
than gas in power stations, according to Gray. The year-ahead
 clean-dark spread , a measure of the profit from burning coal to
generate electricity, was at 7.58 euros a megawatt-hour today,
while the equivalent measure for gas was minus 14.4 euros,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
