Construction spending in the U.S.
unexpectedly fell in January following the biggest back-to-back
gain in a year, reflecting a slump in nonresidential and
government projects.  Outlays dropped 2.1 percent, the biggest decrease since
July 2011, to a $883.3 billion annual rate, a Commerce
Department report showed today in  Washington . The  median 
forecast of 45 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 0.4
percent rise. Figures for December and November were revised up
to show gains of 1.1 percent and 1.9 percent respectively, the
best performance since the same two months in 2011.  Private non-residential building was depressed by a plunge
in construction of power plants, while public outlays dropped to
the lowest level since November 2006 as government agencies face
budget strains. At the same time,  mortgage costs  near a record
low are helping the residential real-estate market to recover,
benefiting builders like  PulteGroup Inc. (PHM)   “We’re likely to see improvement in housing this year,”
Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in  New York ,
said before the report. “Growth rates for sales and
construction should be strong.”  Estimates in the Bloomberg survey ranged from a drop of 0.7
percent to a gain of 1 percent, following an initially reported
0.9 percent increase for December and a 0.1 percent November
advance.  Consumer Spending  Another Commerce Department report today showed  consumer
spending  rose in January even as incomes dropped by the most in
20 years, indicating households were weathering the payroll-tax
increase by socking away less money in the bank.  Household purchases, which account for about 70 percent of
the economy, climbed 0.2 percent after a 0.1 percent gain the
prior month. Incomes slumped 3.6 percent, sending the saving
rate down to the lowest level since November 2007.  Also today, the  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory
index unexpectedly rose to 54.2 in February from 53.1 a month
earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said today.  Economists projected the gauge would ease to 52.5,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey. A
reading greater than 50 signals expansion.  Stocks trimmed earlier losses following the manufacturing
report. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent to
1,508.07 at 10:04 a.m. in New York.  12-Month Gain  Construction spending increased 7.6 percent in the 12
months ended in January, before adjusting for seasonal
variations, according to today’s Commerce Department report.  Private construction spending dropped 2.6 percent from the
prior month.  Homebuilding outlays were little changed, depressed by a
4.3 percent drop in home-improvement outlays. Spending on
single-family projects rose 3.6 percent and multifamily housing
climbed 1.7 percent.  Private non-residential projects decreased spending by 5.1
percent, led by a 14.5 percent slump for  power plants .  Spending on public construction declined 1 percent from the
prior month. Federal construction spending fell 1.3 percent,
while state and local outlays retreated 1 percent to the lowest
level since November 2006.  Outlays climbed 9.9 percent for all of 2012, the first
annual increase since 2006 and the biggest since 2005, today’s
report showed.  Housing Gains  Recent reports indicate a pickup in demand. Purchases of
 new homes , logged when contracts are signed, jumped in January
to a 437,000 annual pace, the strongest since 2008, the Commerce
Department reported. Sales of previously-owned houses climbed to
a  4.92 million  annual rate in January, and the number of
available properties slumped to 1.74 million, the lowest level
since 1999, the National Association of Realtors said.  Residential construction is also improving. The Commerce
Department reported that single-family home starts increased in
January to the highest level since July 2008. Total housing
starts dropped to an 890,000 rate, restrained by a drop in
construction of multifamily dwellings.  Bloomfield Hills , Michigan-based company PulteGroup, the
largest U.S. homebuilder by market value, said orders rose 27
percent in the fourth quarter while backlog, an indication of
future revenue, jumped 82 percent.  “We have every reason to expect that housing has indeed
turned the corner and that industry sales in 2013 can continue
to move higher as pent-up demand is released,”  Richard Dugas ,
chief executive officer, said on a Jan. 31 earnings call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
