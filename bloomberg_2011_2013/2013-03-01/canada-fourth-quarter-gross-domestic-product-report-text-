The following is the text of
the fourth quarter GDP report released by  Statistics Canada .  Real gross domestic product (GDP) edged up 0.2% in the
fourth quarter, similar to the gain in the third quarter. On a
monthly basis, real GDP by industry declined 0.2% in December.  Final domestic demand was up 0.6%, compared with a 0.2%
gain the previous quarter. Household and government final
consumption expenditures and business fixed  capital investment 
all increased. Inventory investment slowed sharply from the
third quarter. Imports were down, while exports increased
slightly.  Mining and oil and gas extraction was the main source of
industrial growth in the fourth quarter. Construction, the
public sector, utilities and the finance and insurance sector
also increased. Manufacturing recorded a significant decrease (-
2.2%), with both durable and non-durable goods production
retreating. The arts and entertainment sector, transportation
and warehousing as well as wholesale trade also declined.  Expressed at an annualized rate, real GDP expanded 0.6% in
the fourth quarter. By comparison, real GDP in the  United States 
grew 0.1%.  Consumer spending advances  Household spending on goods and services advanced 0.7% in
the fourth quarter, the same pace as in the third quarter.
 Consumer spending  grew faster in the last two quarters of 2012
than in any quarter since the fourth quarter of 2010.  Spending on goods was up 0.7%, as outlays on durable goods
increased 0.9%. Consumer spending on services was 0.7% higher.  Outlays on transport advanced 1.0%, the second consecutive
quarterly increase, driven by purchases of vehicles (+1.8%).  Outlays on recreation and culture increased 0.3%, following
a 0.4% advance in the third quarter. Spending on insurance and
financial services increased 1.0%, after two quarters of decline.  Higher business investment in plant and equipment  Business investment in non-residential structures advanced

engineering structures were up.  Business investment in machinery and equipment grew 0.3%,
the third consecutive quarter of weak growth. Industrial
machinery and equipment outlays were down 1.5% in the quarter.
Investment in medium and heavy trucks, buses and other motor
vehicles (-1.7%) was also down, the third consecutive quarterly
decline.  Investment in aircraft and other transportation equipment
(+13.6%) was notably higher. Outlays on computers and peripheral
equipment were up 3.7%, following three quarters of decline.  Investment in housing turns up  Business investment in residential structures rose 0.2% in
the fourth quarter, after declining 0.6% in the third quarter.
Both renovation activity (+0.6%) and new  home construction 
(+0.3%) were higher.  Ownership transfer costs decreased 0.8%, following sharper
declines in the second and third quarters, on weaker housing
resale activity.  Government spending advances  Government final consumption expenditure increased 0.5% in
the fourth quarter, following a decline of 0.1% in the third
quarter.  Final consumption outlays of government had been weak over
the previous four quarters.  Slowdown in business inventory accumulation  Non-farm business inventory accumulation was sharply lower
in the fourth quarter ($5.7 billion) compared with the third
quarter ($13.5 billion).  Manufacturers’ inventories of durable goods (-$2.1 billion)
were down. Wholesalers’ inventories of durable goods (-$2.3
billion) were also down, while retailers’ inventories of durable
goods rose by $2.7 billion.  Farm inventories, notably of grains, were sold off in the
fourth quarter.  Imports down  Imports of goods and services fell 0.3% in the fourth
quarter, the first decrease since the third quarter of 2011.  Industrial machinery, equipment and parts (-3.6%), basic
and industrial chemical, plastic and rubber products (-3.3%) and
motor vehicles and parts (-1.5%) imports were the main
contributors to the decline.  Aircraft and other transportation equipment imports
rebounded 13.1% in the fourth quarter, following an 8.1% decline
in the third quarter.  Imports of services were down 0.7%, as all categories of
services fell except travel services (+0.8%).  Exports edge up  Exports edged up 0.3% in the fourth quarter, following a
1.9% decline in the third quarter.  Exports of goods were up 0.3%, with farm, fishing and
intermediate food products (+17.2%) and energy products (+1.5%)
contributing the most to the increase.  Exports of metal ores and non-metallic minerals (-8.3%) and
metal and non-metallic mineral products (-2.8%) were notably
lower. Electronic and electrical equipment and parts exports
fell 4.6%, the fifth quarter of decline.  Exports of services increased 0.2%, led by a 2.4% increase
in travel services.  Economy-wide income expands at slower pace  Nominal GDP expanded 0.5% in the fourth quarter, slower
than the 0.9% pace of the previous quarter.  Compensation of employees rose 0.6% following a 1.1%
increase in the third quarter. Wages and salaries in service-
producing industries grew 0.4%, one-third the pace of the
previous quarter (+1.1%).  The net operating surplus of corporations fell 1.0%,
following a 0.7% gain in the previous quarter and a weak first
half of the year. Net operating surplus of non-financial
corporations decreased 1.5%, while that of financial
corporations increased 3.4%.  Household saving down  Household disposable income (in current dollars) increased
0.3% in the fourth quarter as primary incomes increased 0.5%,
and transfers paid to other sectors outpaced transfers received.
Household final consumption expenditure was up 0.7% in the
quarter, and the household saving rate decreased to 3.8% in the
fourth quarter from 4.2% in the third quarter.  The household debt service ratio, defined as household
mortgage and non-mortgage interest paid divided by household
disposable income, was 7.4% in the fourth quarter. This ratio is
similar to that of the previous three quarters but less than the
average rate of 7.6% recorded in 2011.  The national saving rate was 4.4%, compared with 5.2% in
the third quarter. The decrease resulted from lower household,
corporate and government savings. National disposable income
edged down 0.1%, after 0.5% growth in the third quarter.  Improved terms of trade  Canada ’s terms of trade, which measure export prices
relative to import prices, advanced 1.2% in the fourth quarter.
Real gross domestic income increased 0.5%.  The price of goods and services produced in Canada rose
0.4%, after advancing 0.6% in the third quarter. Export prices
increased 1.0%, following three quarters of decline. Import
prices (-0.1%) were slightly lower following a 2.2% decline in
the third quarter.  The price of final domestic demand rose 0.1% after
increasing 0.4% in the third quarter.  Annual, 2012  Real GDP expanded 1.8% in 2012 after growing 2.6% in 2011.
Final domestic demand was up 1.9%, following a 2.7% increase in
2011.  All major industrial sectors rose in 2012 with the
exception of arts and entertainment, and public administration.
Goods production increased 1.9% while the output of services
grew 1.8%.  Construction, notably residential building, and
manufacturing, led by transportation equipment, were the main
contributors to growth in goods production. Health care and
social services, finance and insurance, professional services as
well as wholesale and retail trade contributed to the increase
in service producing industries. A labour dispute in
professional hockey contributed to the decline in the arts and
entertainment sector in 2012.  Household consumption spending rose 1.9%, driven by outlays
on durable goods (+2.8%) and services (+2.2%). By comparison,
consumer spending was up 2.4% in 2011.  Government final consumption expenditure increased 0.4% in
2012. The pace of growth in  government spending  has slowed in
every year since 2008, when it increased by 4.6%.  Business investment in residential structures advanced 5.8%
in 2012, three times the pace (+1.9%) set one year earlier. New
home construction was up 12.8%. On the other hand, business
investment in plant and equipment (+6.2%) grew at a slower pace
compared with one year earlier (+10.4%).  Trade volumes slowed considerably in 2012. Exports rose
1.6%, one-third their pace in 2011 (+4.6%). Imports grew 2.9%,
half their pace in 2011 (+5.8%).  Household disposable income (in current dollars) advanced
3.4% in 2012. The household saving rate edged up to 4.0% from
3.8% one year earlier.  The household debt service ratio was 7.4% in 2012. This
ratio has been declining since 2007, indicating that debt
servicing requires a smaller portion of household disposable
income.  Real gross domestic income grew 1.5% in 2012, less than
half the pace set in 2011 (+3.6%). Canada’s terms of trade fell
1.2% after gaining 3.6% in 2011.  The price of goods and services produced in Canada
increased 1.3%, compared with an increase of 3.1% in 2011. The
price of final domestic demand was up 1.6%, following a 2.3%
increase in 2011.  Gross domestic product by industry, December 2012  Real GDP declined 0.2% in December, following a 0.3%
increase in November. Manufacturing and, to a lesser extent,
retail trade and utilities were the main sources of the December
decline. Wholesale trade, transportation and warehousing, as
well as the arts and entertainment sector also decreased.
Increases were recorded in finance and insurance, mining and oil
and gas extraction, accommodation and food services, the public
sector (education, health and public administration combined)
and construction.  Manufacturing production declined 1.8% in December, after a
0.9% increase in November. Declines were widespread, as
manufacturing of both durable and non-durable goods retreated.
Motor vehicle manufacturing fell 9.9%, partially as a result of
longer than usual holiday shutdowns. There were also decreases
in fabricated metal products, food, furniture and related
products, and motor vehicle parts manufacturing.  Retail trade declined 1.6% in December, following three
consecutive monthly increases. Reduced output of motor vehicle
and parts dealers was the main contributor to the December
decline. Retailing at electronics and appliance stores fell
10.1% in December, following strong activity in November.
Wholesale trade (-0.6%) also declined in December, primarily
because of a decrease in the wholesaling of machinery and
equipment.  Utilities fell 1.9% in December, after three consecutive
monthly increases. Both electricity production and natural gas
distribution receded.  Gains in the finance and insurance sector were widespread
in December. Banking and other depository credit intermediation
increased 0.9%. Increased mutual fund activity and strength in
new corporate bond issues led to gains in financial investment
services.  Mining and oil and gas extraction grew 0.3%. The increases
in coal and metal ore mining outweighed the declines in non-
metallic mineral mining (in particular potash). Oil and gas
extraction edged up 0.1%.  Construction output was up 0.2%, as increases in
engineering, repair and non-residential building construction
more than offset a slight decline in residential building
construction. The output of real estate agents and brokers fell
for a third consecutive month.  Note to readers  For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal

statistics (such as personal expenditures, investment, exports,
imports and output) are calculated from volume measures that are
adjusted for price variations. Percentage changes for income-
based and flow-of-funds statistics (such as labour income,
corporate profits, mortgage borrowing and total funds raised)
are calculated from nominal values; that is, they are not
adjusted for price variations.  There are four ways of expressing growth rates for gross
domestic product (GDP) and other time series found in this
release.  1. Unless otherwise stated, the growth rates of all
quarterly data in this release represent the percentage change
in the series from one quarter to the next, such as from the
third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2012.  2. Quarterly growth can be expressed at an annual rate by
using a compound growth formula, similar to the way in which a
monthly  interest rate  can be expressed at an annual rate.
Expressing growth at an annual rate facilitates comparisons with
official GDP statistics from the United States. Both the
quarterly growth rate and the annualized quarterly growth rate
should be interpreted as an indication of the latest trend in
GDP.  3. The year-over-year growth rate is the percentage change
in GDP from a given quarter in one year to the same quarter one
year later, such as from the fourth quarter of 2011 to the
fourth quarter of 2012.  4. The growth rates of all monthly data in this article
represent the percentage change in the series from one month to
the next, such as from November to December 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
