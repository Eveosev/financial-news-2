(Corrects spelling of company name in last paragraph of
story published March 1.)  Aqua America Inc. (WTR) , the second-
biggest U.S. water utility by market value, bought assets in
Pennsylvania and Virginia in two separate transactions.  Aqua America acquired Total Environmental Solutions Inc.’s
water and wastewater assets that serve 6,000 people in
Pennsylvania for $11.8 million, the company said in a statement
today. The purchase brings to 31 the number of counties in the
state that  Bryn Mawr , Pennsylvania-based Aqua America serves.  The company also bought the British Woods Water Co. in
Botetcourt County, Virginia, earlier this week. The system
serves about 150 people and terms weren’t disclosed.  Aqua America last week reported fourth-quarter profit that
almost doubled to $66.6 million on rising sales and a tax
deduction. American Water Works Co. is the largest U.S. water
utility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
