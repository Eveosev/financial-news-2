Gold swung between gains and losses,
after the longest run of monthly declines since 1997, as
investors weighed improving global economic data amid
speculation that central banks will press on with stimulus.  Gold for immediate delivery was at $1,579.41 an ounce at
3:46 p.m. in  Singapore  from $1,579.58 yesterday. Prices are set
to decline 0.1 percent this week after dropping 5.1 percent in
February for the fifth monthly drop as  investment holdings 
plunged 4.2 percent. Bullion for April delivery was little
changed at $1,578.90 on the Comex in  New York .  Prices fell 5.7 percent this year after a 12-year rally in
2012 as investor cut  holdings  in exchange-traded products to the
lowest since September. European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi  said this week that the bank is far from exiting stimulus,
while U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  defended the
bank’s asset purchases. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said that the
commodity’s price cycle had turned as the  U.S. economy  recovers.  “Sentiment is improving and as a result of the world’s
economy improving there’s less need for gold as a hedge against
disaster,” said  Gavin Wendt , a director at Mine Life Pty. in
Sydney. “The reasons for holding gold are typically inversely
proportional to the health of the world economy. When times are
good, people don’t want to invest in gold.”  Global Recovery  Jobless claims in the U.S. dropped in the week that ended
Feb. 23, the government said yesterday. German unemployment
unexpectedly fell in February amid signs that Europe’s biggest
economy is recovering, and Japan’s industrial production in
January rose for the second straight month. Two Chinese
manufacturing  indexes  showed today the world’s second-largest
economy expanded at a slower-than-estimated pace.  Traders are divided on the outlook, with 15 analysts
expecting prices to gain next week, while 14 were bearish and
three were neutral, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Gold ETPs fell for an eighth day to 2,502.75 metric tons
yesterday, the lowest since September, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the
biggest exchange-traded product backed by the metal, fell to the
lowest since August. The  U.S. Mint  said gold coin sales were
80,500 ounces in February from 150,000 ounces a month earlier.  Cash bullion of 99.99 percent purity on the Shanghai Gold
Exchange lost 1 percent to 320.70  yuan  a gram ($1,602.89 an
