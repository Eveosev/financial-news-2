Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) , the
world’s biggest international air-cargo carrier, canceled an
order for eight  Boeing Co. (BA)  777-200 freighters as it revamps its
fleet.  Cathay will instead buy three Boeing 747-8 freighters worth
$1 billion at list prices, the carrier said in a  filing  to Hong
Kong stock exchange today. The company also has options to
purchase five Boeing 777-200 freighters, it said.  The airline will sell four Boeing 747-400 converted
freighters to Boeing as part of the fleet restructuring. Cathay
has cut capacity and is using more efficient aircraft to improve
cargo business that accounts for about a quarter of the
airline’s revenue. The global  air freight market  shrank 1.5
percent last year, according to the International Air Transport
Association, as economic uncertainty damped demand.  The new planes will be used for long-haul destinations in
 North America  and Europe, Cathay said, adding that it expects to
take deliveries of the aircraft this year. Pre-delivery payments
made for the 777-200 freighters will be used for the purchase of
the three new planes, it said.  Air China Cargo, a joint venture between Cathay and  Air
China Ltd. (753) , will also sell seven Boeing 747-400 converted
freighters and buy eight Boeing 777-200 freighters, Cathay said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
