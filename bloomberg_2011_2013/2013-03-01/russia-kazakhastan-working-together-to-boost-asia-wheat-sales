Russia , the world’s third-biggest
wheat exporter last season, wants to sell more grain to  Asia  by
combining efforts with neighboring Kazakhstan, said Andrey Slepnev, the Eurasian Economic Commission’s trade minister.  There are no custom borders between the two countries, an
arrangement which is overseen by the EEC, which also includes
Belarus. Russia and Kazakhstan are also creating common railway
tariffs and plan to mesh other transportation industries to
expand grain export opportunities, Slepnev said in a Feb. 26
interview in Geneva.  “We are interested in multiplying our efforts to push our
grain products to the world market,” he said, adding they’re
particularly interested in Asia.  Russia and Kazakhstan are ranked among the world’s top six
wheat exporters by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . The two
countries’ combined wheat exports are expected to be 17 million
metric tons in the year which ends on June 30, according to the
USDA estimates.  The largest wheat shipper in 2012-13 is expected to be the
U.S., with an estimated 28.6 million tons, according to the
USDA. The European Union and  Canada , each with 18.5 million
tons, come next in the ranking, followed by  Australia  with 16.5
million tons. Russia and Kazakhstan follow in the rankings and
would surpass Australia if their export numbers were combined.  To contact the reporters on this story:
