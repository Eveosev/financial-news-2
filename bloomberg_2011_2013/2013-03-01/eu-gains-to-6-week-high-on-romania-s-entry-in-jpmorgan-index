The leu retreated from its highest
level in almost six weeks after  Romania  cut its monthly local-
debt sales plan.  The currency reversed an earlier gain after the Finance
Ministry said today it plans to raise 3 billion lei ($893
million) through auctions in March, below the 3.7 billion lei
target and 4 billion lei of securities sold last month. The leu,
the second-best performer among European, Middle Eastern and
African peers tracked by Bloomberg this year, has benefited from
an announcement local Romanian debt is being added to  JPMorgan &
Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s bond indexes from March 1 and
March 31, respectively, according to Societe Generale SA.  “The weaker leu move coincided with the less-than-expected
issuance plan and only one bond of the three JPMorgan bonds will
be reopened,” Esther Law, a London-based director of emerging-
markets strategy at Societe Generale, said by e-mail today.
“This may have something to with the expectation on potential
inflows” in the “near term.”  The leu depreciated 0.2 percent to 4.3645 per euro by 6:23
p.m. in Bucharest, after earlier strengthening to its highest
level since Jan. 21.  Romania’s October 2015, January 2016 and July 2017 bonds
currently meet the criteria for index inclusion as they
demonstrate the highest degree of liquidity, according to
JPMorgan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
