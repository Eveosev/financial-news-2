St. John’s University suspended
guard D’Angelo Harrison for the rest of the college basketball
season, removing the team’s leading scorer as postseason play
approaches.  The Red Storm didn’t say why Harrison, a sophomore and the
team’s captain, was banned. He’ll miss the team’s final three
regular-season games, the Big East Conference tournament and any
other postseason appearances. The announcement was made in a
 statement  posted on the school’s website.  “I had a productive meeting with D’Angelo yesterday,” St.
John’s coach Steve Lavin said in a statement. “He has a bright
future in basketball and I’m optimistic his time away from our
team will be of value.”  Harrison’s 17.8 points per game rank third in the Big East
and are tied for 48th in the nation.  New York-based St. John’s is 16-11, including 8-7 in the
Big East. The Red Storm play at Providence tomorrow before
closing out conference play at Notre Dame and at home against
Marquette.  To contact the reporter on this story:
