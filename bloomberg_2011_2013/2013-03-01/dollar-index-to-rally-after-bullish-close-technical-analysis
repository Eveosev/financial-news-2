 The Dollar Index may rise to match
the highest level since July 2010 after completing a “bullish
outside month,” Citigroup Inc. said, citing trading patterns.  The gauge yesterday closed at 81.95 in  New York , rising 3.5
percent in February, the biggest monthly advance since May. A
close above 80.87 would signal further gains targeting 82.75 and
then 84.10 for the Intercontinental Exchange Inc. index,
analysts led by  Tom Fitzpatrick , chief technical analyst at
Citigroup in New York, wrote in a note to clients yesterday.  “Additional signs are coming through that a significant
rally lies ahead on the DXY index,” Fitzpatrick wrote. “The
target here is 82.75 though we would not be surprised to see a
move to resistance at 84.10.”  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners, was little
changed at 81.89 as of 11:33 a.m. in  Tokyo , set for a 0.5
percent weekly advance.  It last rose as high as 84.10 on July 24. That was its
strongest level since July 2010.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Support refers to an
area on a graph where analysts predict buy orders may be
clustered while sell orders may be grouped around an area of
resistance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
