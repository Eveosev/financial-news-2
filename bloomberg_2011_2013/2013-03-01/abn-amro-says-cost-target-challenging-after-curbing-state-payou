ABN Amro Group NV cut a planned
payout to the bank’s Dutch state owners and said new levies will
make it harder to meet a cost target.  The bank will pay the Dutch government 250 million euros
($327 million), unchanged from 2011, and less than its goal of
paying 40 percent of net income, the Amsterdam-based company
said in a statement today. ABN Amro said it plans to gradually
attain that level by 2015.  ABN Amro, the third-largest Dutch bank, said the lower
dividend will strengthen its capital buffers as tougher
regulations are introduced. While full-year profit rose 43
percent to 948 million euros, earnings were boosted by one-time
gains of 386 million euros compared with year-earlier charges of
646 million euros, which included Greek loan impairments.  Fourth-quarter earnings were reduced by a 112 million-euro
charge for a Dutch bank tax, introduced in October to force
lenders to share the costs of ensuring financial stability in
the wake of bailouts of  ING Groep NV (INGA) ,  SNS Reaal NV (SR)  and ABN Amro
since 2008. The Dutch state aims to raise about 600 million
euros a year from the levy.  ABN Amro, which was nationalized after Fortis’s collapse in
2008, said its cost-to-income ratio improved to 61 percent from
64 percent in 2011.  Cost Target  Meeting a target of reducing the ratio to less than 60
percent by the end of 2014 will be “challenging” because of
regulatory costs and planned technology investments of about 700
million euros by 2017, the bank said. ABN Amro is aiming for a
ratio of 56 percent to 60 percent by 2017.  ABN Amro will also have to pay as much as 250 million euros
of a 1 billion-euro one-time industry levy next year after the
Netherlands took control of SNS Reaal on Feb. 1. Lenders will
also have to start contributing to a deposit guarantee fund to
reimburse deposit holders in case a bank fails.  The company, which in 2011 set out to cut 2,350 jobs by
next year, doesn’t plan a new round of reductions, Chairman
Gerrit Zalm told reporters today. There will probably be a
gradual decrease in staff after 2014, he said.  Rabobank Groep, the biggest mortgage lender in the
Netherlands, yesterday said it plans to cut 3,000 jobs by 2014
and sees a further annual decline of 1,500 a year from 2015 as
customers switch to banking via the Internet and mobile
telephones. ING last month announced 1,400 additional cuts in
the Netherlands for the same reason.  Bad Loans  Full-year profit excluding one-time items related to ABN
Amro’s nationalization, divestments and Greek-debt writedowns
would have been 34 percent lower than in 2011, due to a “sharp
increase in loan impairments,” the company said.  Bad-loan provisions, excluding those on Greek debt, rose 54
percent in 2012 on higher impairments on commercial real estate
lending, construction, diamond financing and residential
mortgages. The state-owned lender last year derived 82 percent
of operating income from the Netherlands, where the economy is
forecast to contract 0.5 percent this year.  ABN Amro seeks to lower its reliance on the Netherlands by
expanding its international operations, including private
banking and energy and commodities finance, to 20 percent to 25
percent of revenue by 2017, it said today. It wants to reduce
risks from concentration, said Zalm, adding that half the bank’s
loan book consists of Dutch mortgages.  CFO Retiring  ABN Amro’s core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of a bank’s
financial strength, rose to 12.1 percent at the end of December
from 10.7 percent a year earlier.  ABN Amro Chief Financial Officer Jan van Rutte will retire
in June and be replaced by Kees van Dijkhuizen, former
treasurer-general of the Dutch Ministry of Finance and currently
CFO of NIBC Bank NV.  The Netherlands put up 30 billion euros to rescue Fortis’s
Dutch banking and insurance units and the bank’s stake in ABN
Amro Holding NV in 2008. Since the nationalization of SNS Reaal
last month, the state owns two of the four banks designated as
“too-big-to-fail” by the country’s central bank. Rabobank
Groep and ING are the other two lenders.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Spain’s Banco Santander
SA and Fortis bought ABN Amro in 2007 for about 72 billion euros
in the world’s biggest banking takeover.  To contact the reporter on this story:
