The  Sierra Club  said 142 U.S. coal-
fired  power plants  have closed during its campaign against the
fuel, representing 105 gigawatts of electrical capacity.  With the agreement announced by American Electric Power Co.
this week that it will shut three of its coal plants, the Sierra
Club said its  Beyond Coal  campaign is more than halfway towards
its goal of retiring 30 percent of the U.S. coal fleet by 2020.  “While Congress is paralyzed by partisan bickering, our
grassroots, people-powered campaign is succeeding city-by-city
and state-by-state, helping the U.S. lead the world in cutting
dangerous carbon emissions,”  Michael Brune , executive director
of the Sierra Club, the country’s biggest environmental group,
said in a statement.  New York  Mayor Mike Bloomberg donated $50 million to the
Sierra Club 18 months ago to fund the anti-coal efforts. The
mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent
Bloomberg LP.  Analysts said that cheap natural gas and looming
federal emission standards are a big reason plant operators are
deciding to close or shift fuel sources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
