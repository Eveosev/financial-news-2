Euro-area  manufacturing output 
contracted for a 19th straight month in February as the currency
bloc struggled to emerge from a recession.  A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area held at
47.9, London-based Markit Economics said today. That’s above an
 initial estimate  of 47.8 on Feb. 21. A reading below 50
indicates contraction.  The euro-area recession deepened in the fourth quarter, as
the economy recorded its worst performance in four years with a
contraction of 0.6 percent. Gross domestic product will decline
again in the first three months before returning to growth in
the second quarter, according to the median of 21 economists’
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s largest carmaker, is preparing for
a drop in first-quarter earnings as the region’s auto market
enters its sixth year of declines. Profit in the first three
months “will be clearly below” the first quarter of 2012,
according to Chief Financial Officer Hans Dieter Poetsch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
