Leucadia National Corp. (LUK)  had its
credit rating upgraded to BBB from BB+ by Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Services after finishing its takeover of  Jefferies Group
LLC (JEF) , whose outlook was lifted to stable.  “Our upgrade of Leucadia reflects the combined entities’
stronger business and financial profiles as well as new
management’s established targets for leverage, liquidity, and
investment concentration,” Kenneth Frey and Jeffrey Zaun. S&P’s
analysts, said today in a statement.  Leucadia said yesterday it completed the acquisition of
Jefferies, which the two New York-based firms announced in
November. The deal gives Jefferies stronger liquidity, faster
capital growth and “better business opportunities,” the
analysts wrote in the statement.  Jefferies Chief Executive Officer Richard Handler, 51,
becomes head of Leucadia while maintaining his other title.
Leucadia Chairman and CEO Ian Cumming will retire. The combined
management has developed financial targets that “constrain
financial risk to a level that we view as in line with a ’BBB’
rating,” the analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
