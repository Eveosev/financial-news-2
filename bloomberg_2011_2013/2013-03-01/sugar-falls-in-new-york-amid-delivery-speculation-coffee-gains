Sugar declined in  New York  before
what may be the smallest delivery for a March contract since
2006. Arabica coffee also fell.  Raw sugar delivered against the expired March futures
contract will probably be 150,000 tons to 155,000 tons, the
smallest for the March contract since 2006, said Fabienne Pointier, an analyst at Lausanne, Switzerland-based Kingsman SA,
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. Most of the sugar will be shipped from
Central American nations and some from Brazil, she said. ICE
will publish the delivery for the March futures later today.  Sugar for May delivery traded on ICE Futures U.S. gained as
much as 2.8 percent yesterday, the biggest intraday advance for
the contract this year.  Brazil  is preparing tax breaks that may
channel more of the country’s sugar cane into ethanol production
to meet additional demand, two people with knowledge of the plan
said. That would mean smaller supplies of the raw material for
millers to make the sweetener.  “There are still logistical constraints in Brazil because
of competition with other crops, uncertainty over what will
happen to taxes on ethanol, and possibly a disappointing Thai
crop,” Pointier said today by phone. “The rally in the May
futures yesterday was helped partially because of uncertainty
over the ethanol tax.”  Raw sugar for May delivery dropped 0.3 percent to 18.34
cents a pound by 7:57 a.m. on ICE. White sugar for May delivery
was 0.2 percent higher at $520.80 a ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  Expired Delivery  Raw sugar for March delivery expired yesterday at a
discount of 0.01 cent a pound to the May futures. That reduced
the incentive for traders to deliver sugar that is trading at a
premium to the exchange, Pointier said. Raw sugar for loading
this month at the Brazilian port of Santos was at a premium of
0.05 cent to 0.15 cent a pound to the ICE price on Feb. 23,
according to Swiss Sugar Brokers. The sweetener from  Thailand 
for loading this month through May 15 was at a premium of 0.7
cent to 0.8 cent on the same date, the data showed.  “Premiums paid for Thai and Brazilian sugar in the
physical market discouraged traders from delivering on ICE as
the March futures switched to a discount to May,” Pointier
said. “Traders didn’t think it was worth delivering the most
demanded origins with the spread at a discount.”  Ethanol in sugar equivalent terms was trading yesterday at
20.36 cents a pound, according to Kingsman. That’s 11 percent
more than the May raw sugar futures closed on ICE yesterday.  Cocoa for delivery in May declined 0.8 percent to $2,117 a
ton in New York. Cocoa for delivery in March slipped 0.5 percent
to 1,402 pounds ($2,109) a ton in  London .  Arabica coffee for delivery in May was down 0.2 percent to
$1.429 a pound on ICE. Robusta coffee for delivery in May fell
0.3 percent to $2,101 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
