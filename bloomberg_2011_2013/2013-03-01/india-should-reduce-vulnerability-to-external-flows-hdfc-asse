Prashant Jain , chief investment
officer at HDFC Asset Management Co., speaks in a Bloomberg TV
 India  interview. HDFC is India’s biggest money manager with
$18.6 billion in assets.  On the budget:  “There are good sides and not so good sides to it. We must
appreciate the circumstances in which it was done. On the fiscal
side, a reasonably good job has been done and, of course, there
could be some minor slippages or the other way round but that
would depend on how crude oil prices and the currency behave. By
and large it is a fairly credible set of numbers on the fiscal
deficit. My only negative take was that nothing much or
significant has been done on the current account and now most
people agree that current account is a bigger challenge.  ‘‘On the fiscal side, I can’t find any flaws. It is a good
job done and there is logic to increasing the planned
expenditure also because ultimately the government has to focus
on growth. Under the circumstances, within the limited resources
that you have, it is a good job done as far as the fiscal side
is concerned.’’  On current account deficit:  ‘‘Budget is not the only place where the government can
act. I am sure they realize it much more than people like me do
but current account is a real challenge and the government
should take steps to moderate it. Otherwise, we will continue to
be vulnerable to capital flows. If for some reason capital flows
do not come for even limited periods of time, and the currency
depreciates, it could upset your fiscal math also. So current
account is the real challenge and that is what the government
should be seized of.  ‘‘There is nothing in the budget that specifically
addresses current account deficit. There are basically three
parts to it. One is oil, where demand is inelastic; prices are
not in your control and you can’t do virtually anything about
it. The second is gold. Gold is also unproductive and you can
take steps to moderate the demand for gold.’’  On RBI action:  ‘‘Clearly,  interest rates  have to move down because GDP
growth has come off very significantly, demand conditions have
moderated, inflationary pressures are moderating very fast and
we are seeing extremely weak demand conditions in key consumer
categories as well. And the government has done a lot in the
last three to six months to manage fiscal deficit a lot better.
It was a very tough decision. The worst of fiscal appears to be
clearly behind us and since inflationary pressures are waning,
the RBI would now certainly do more because that’s the need of
the hour. You need lower interest rates.’’  On valuations:  ‘‘Historically, our price to earnings has never gone below
10-11 levels. Current P/E multiple is closer to fair and there
is undervaluation. Ultimately, interest rates will move down,
growth will improve and multiples also will start moving up.’’  On overseas flows:  ‘‘We will continue to be vulnerable to both  oil prices  and
capital flows. In 18 out of 20 years we have seen net buying by
foreigners. Our growth rates are among the top tier. We will see
capital flows to continue in the long term. Structurally, in the
long term, India will continue to get capital. The country is
emerging as a core asset. In the short term, we are vulnerable
to disruption in capital flows.  ‘‘We are in a situation where we are not derisked. We hope
that government does something to reduce our vulnerability to
external capital flows.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
