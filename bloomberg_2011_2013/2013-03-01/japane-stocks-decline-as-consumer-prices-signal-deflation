Japanese stocks  rose, with the  Topix
Index (TPX)  closing at its highest since 2010, after a drop in
consumer prices added pressure on the  Bank of Japan (8301)  to heed
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s call to curb deflation. Property
companies and utilities advanced.  Mitsubishi Estate Co. (8802)  added 6.1 percent to pace gains among
developers on expectations for more easing.  Tokyo  Electric Power
Co. led utilities higher after Abe yesterday said the government
will restart nuclear plants once safety is assured.  Hitachi
Construction Machinery Co. (6305) , a Japanese machinery maker that gets
17 percent of its sales in  China , dropped 2.1 percent after data
showed the pace of mainland manufacturing growth unexpectedly
slowed.  The Topix rose 0.9 percent to 984.33 in Tokyo, its highest
close since April 30, 2010. The equity gauge gained 2.2 percent
on the week. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 0.4 percent to
11,606.38 after completing a seven-month advance yesterday.
Trading volume was 27 percent below the 30-day average.  “Deflation is so entrenched and that’s why expectations
are high for the BOJ,” said Isao Kubo, a Tokyo-based equity
strategist at Nissay Asset Management Corp., which oversees
about 5 trillion yen ($54 billion.) “They have to make bold
moves to revive the economy if they really want to see
inflation.”  The Topix surged 36 percent from Nov. 14 as a new
government came to power, with Abe yesterday nominating a
proponent of stimulus to lead the BOJ. The measure is trading at
1.2 times  book value , compared with 2.1 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  BOJ Outlook  Japan’s consumer prices excluding fresh food fell 0.2
percent in January from a year earlier, the third straight
decline, the statistics bureau said today. If confirmed by
parliament, Asian Development Bank President  Haruhiko Kuroda 
will replace BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa.  Analysts at banks from Nomura Holdings Inc. to Mizuho
Securities Co. say more easing may be coming as soon as the
central bank convenes April 3, its first meeting after the
sitting governor retires on March 19.  Developers gained on expectations for more stimulus.
Mitsubishi Estate gained 6.1 percent to 2,450 yen. Hoosiers
Corp., which designs and markets condominiums, jumped 9.2
percent to 84,700 yen.  Utilities gained after Abe’s remarks on restarting nuclear
reactors. The premier also said the government will reduce
reliance on nuclear power, pursuing energy-saving efforts and
maximizing the use of renewable energy.  Tokyo Electric added 2.9 percent to 216 yen. Shikoku
Electric Power Co. gained 2.1 percent to 1,159 yen.  U.S. Stocks  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  slid 0.1 percent today. The
U.S. equity gauge dropped 0.1 percent yesterday as MSCI Inc.
made changes to global and U.S. equity indexes at the close of
trading, a process known as rebalancing that can lead to swings
in affected  stocks . Gains also narrowed after the Senate
rejected proposals to replace $85 billion in automatic spending
cuts set to begin tomorrow.  A Chinese manufacturing index slowed a second month after a
gauge of new orders declined, a signal the nation’s economic
recovery may be losing steam. The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was
50.1 in February, the government reported today, missing
estimates of 50.5. A reading above 50 indicates growth.  Hitachi Construction dropped 2.1 percent 2,085 yen.  TDK
Corp. (6762) , a maker of electronic components that gets 27 percent of
its revenue in China, fell 0.8 percent to 3,175 yen.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 4.6 percent
to 26.51, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.6 percent
of the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
