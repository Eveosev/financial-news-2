Morgan Stanley bought a cargo of
 North Sea  Forties crude. Russian Urals blend gained for a second
day in the Mediterranean after Total SA purchased a shipment.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc booked the first tanker in more than
one month to haul Forties grade to  South Korea  as refinery
maintenance in the Asian nation nears end, according to a
shipbroker report.  North Sea  Phibro, a unit of Occidental Petroleum Corp., sold Forties
crude for a second day, a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window showed. The cargo,
for loading from March 19 to March 21, changed hands at a
premium of 70 cents a barrel to BFOE grades for delivery in May.
Three shipments traded yesterday at 20 cents and 25 cents more
than the Dated Brent benchmark.  Mercuria Energy Trading SA wasn’t able to buy a consignment
for loading March 26 to March 30 at Dated Brent plus 20 cents a
barrel, the survey showed. The trader purchased two cargoes
yesterday at a 25 cent premium.  Shell booked the very large crude carrier Al Salmi to load
270,000 metric tons of the blend on Mar. 15 from Hound Point in
the U.K., an e-mailed report from Norwegian shipbroker PF Bassoe
AS today showed. The rate for the booking was not disclosed. The
terminal handles Forties exports. Total SA last booked a VLCC on
Jan. 24 to load crude in February.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days was unchanged at 12 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for April settlement traded at $110.34 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $112.23 in the previous session. The May
contract was at $109.33, a discount of $1.01 to April.  Mediterranean/Urals  Total bought the Urals cargo from Vitol Group in the
Mediterranean at a smaller discount, the survey of Platts
showed. The 80,000-ton consignment traded at $2.35 a barrel less
than Dated Brent for delivery to Augusta,  Italy . That compares
with a deal at minus $2.90 yesterday. Differentials widened to a
22-month low of $3.40 on Feb. 27.  In northwest  Europe , Total bid without success to buy
100,000 tons at minus $2.50 a barrel for delivery to Rotterdam,
the survey showed.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
