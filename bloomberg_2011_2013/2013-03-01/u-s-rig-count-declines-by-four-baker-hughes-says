The U.S. oil and gas rig count
declined by four to 1,757 this week, according to data from
Baker Hughes Inc.  Oil rigs  increased by four to 1,333, data posted on  Baker
Hughes Inc. (BHI) ’s website show. The  gas count  lost eight to 420, the
lowest level of 2013, the field-services company based in
Houston said.  The total rig count has dropped for 11 of 14 weeks as
producers become more familiar with unconventional plays and are
able to complete more wells with fewer rigs. More efficient
drilling technologies have helped drive U.S. crude production to
the highest level in more than 20 years, weakening the country’s
dependence on foreign oil.  The U.S.  produced  more than 7 million barrels of oil a day
for the first time more than 20 years, the Energy Information
Administration, a division of the Energy Department, said this
week. Output was 7.01 million barrels a day in November, revised
up from 6.89 million previously and the highest since December
1992, the agency said in a monthly  supply report  released Feb.
27.  U.S. oil  stockpiles  rose 0.3 percent to 377.5 million
barrels last week and reached a 22-year high of 387.3 million in
June.  Gas stockpiles  fell 171 billion cubic feet in the week
ended Feb. 22 to 2.2 trillion, according to data compiled by the
EIA. They reached a record high of 3.929 trillion cubic feet on
Nov. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
