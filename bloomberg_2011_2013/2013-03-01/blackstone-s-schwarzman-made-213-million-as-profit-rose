Stephen Schwarzman , co-founder and
chief executive officer of  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , received $213.3
million in pay and cash dividends last year, the private-equity
firm reported yesterday in a filing, almost matching his payout
of $213.5 million a year earlier.  Leon Black , co-founder and CEO of  Apollo Global Management
LLC (APO) , received $125.5 million in compensation and dividends last
year as his combined payout climbed from $77.3 million, Apollo
reported in a separate  filing .  Private-equity executives benefited as a 13 percent rally
in global stocks lifted assets at their firms and fees for
overseeing them.  Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts , KKR & Co.’s
co-founders and co-CEOs, got payouts of more than $137 million
each in 2012, their firm said last week.  Blackstone and Apollo -- the world’s biggest and third-
biggest private-equity firms, respectively -- aren’t required by
the  New York  Stock Exchange, where their shares are listed, to
have compensation committees because they are each considered a
limited partnership. As a result, executive pay decisions are
left to Schwarzman as board chairman and to Black and his co-
founders  Joshua Harris  and Marc Rowan.  Schwarzman, 66, was paid a $350,000 salary and $8.1 million
from his share of the firm’s profits, known as carried interest.
He got $204 million in cash dividends from his ownership of
Blackstone stock, according to the filing.  The co-founder also received $800,000 in distributions from
funds started before the company went public in 2007, called
legacy funds. That amount was $74 million in 2011.  Profit Increase  Black, 61, was paid $287,368, which included a $100,000
salary and $187,368 from other compensation, New York-based
Apollo said. He received $125.2 million in cash dividends from
his ownership of Apollo stock.  Blackstone’s economic net income, a measure of profit
excluding some costs tied to its 2007 initial public offering,
rose 30 percent to $2 billion in 2012 from the previous year,
marking the best performance since the IPO, the firm said in
January. The increase was driven by the 14 percent gain in the
value of Blackstone’s private-equity funds, outpacing the 13
percent gain in the  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD) , and a doubling
of revenues from its credit investments.  “When private equity works, it really works,” Schwarzman
said on a Jan. 31 conference call while discussing the year’s
earnings. “And our credit business had a truly standout year.”  ‘Good Time’  Apollo’s economic net income after taxes, a measure of
profit excluding some costs tied to its 2011 initial public
offering, was $1.5 billion in 2012, compared with a loss of $322
million the previous year, the company said last month. The
increase was driven by the sale of Apollo-owned assets and
strong performance by several of the firm’s largest holdings,
including  LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB)  and  Metals USA Holdings
Corp. (MUSA)   “Given the nature of our portfolio, when it was invested
and how these companies are doing, we believe that we were ripe
for monetizations,” Marc Spilker, Apollo’s president, said last
month on a conference call discussing the firm’s earnings. “As
long as the window stays open, it feels like a good time for us
to monetize.”  Tony James , Blackstone’s president and chief operating
officer, got $66 million during the year. That included a
$350,000 salary, a $30.1 million bonus and $2.8 million in
carried interest, with the remainder coming from dividends on
his stock ownership. Tom Hill, head of Blackstone’s asset-
management business, known as BAAM, received $28.3 million,
including a $350,000 salary, a $7.2 million bonus and a $6.1
million stock award, with the remainder in the form of stock
dividends.  ‘Stronger’ Results  Blackstone last year started disclosing the pay of  Jonathan Gray , the company’s 43-year-old global head of real estate,
after Gray joined the board of directors in February. In 2012,
Gray got $72.9 million in pay and cash dividends, which included
a $350,000 salary, a $28.7 million bonus and $8.2 million in
carried interest. Gray, who joined Blackstone out of college in
1992, owns 8 percent of the firm’s partnership units, which
produced $35.7 million in dividends during the year.  “Commercial real estate results are much stronger than the
economy,” James said on the conference call in January. “We’re
seeing stronger operating results in real estate than we are in
our companies.”  Blackstone’s real estate funds have made money for
investors, producing 1.6 times their invested capital at a net
internal rate of return of 16 percent, Blackstone said in its
most recent earnings  report . The firm’s latest property pool,
Blackstone Real Estate Partners VII, generated a 31 percent net
IRR and a multiple of 1.2 as of Dec. 31.  Fund Returns  The firm has also profited from buyouts, with its private-
equity funds generating 1.6 times invested capital at a net IRR
of 14 percent. Its latest buyout fund, Blackstone Capital
Partners VI, produced a net IRR of 11 percent as of Dec. 31, and
its predecessor pool was generating 2 percent.  Apollo’s private-equity funds have also thrived, generating
a 25 percent net internal rate of return across pools as of Dec.
31, according to Apollo’s most recent earnings report. Its
latest flagship buyout fund, which started investing in 2008
with $14.7 billion, was producing a 26 percent net IRR, with its
value standing at $23.1 billion.  Schwarzman is worth an estimated $7 billion, according to
the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index . Kravis and Roberts, who are
cousins and both 69 years old, are worth about $4.6 billion and
$4.5 billion, respectively. Black is worth an estimated $6.9
billion.  Schwarzman founded Blackstone in 1985 with  Peter G. Peterson , who left the company in 2008 to pursue philanthropic
causes. With $210 billion under management, Blackstone is the
biggest manager of alternative assets, which include private
equity, real estate, credit and  hedge funds .  Apollo, which oversees $113 billion, was founded in 1990 by
Black and two of his previous partners at Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., Joshua Harris and Marc Rowan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
