Palm oil inventory held at ports in
 China , the second-biggest importer, expanded to a record last
month driven by slow growth in demand and after the biggest-ever
purchases in December, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Shipments stored at large ports rose to 1.4 million metric
tons from 1.2 million tons in January, according to the median
of a survey of three researchers and one trader yesterday.
Buyers in China may slow purchases further to absorb the supply
that’s accumulated, they said. A separate estimate today from
researcher Grain.gov.cn put the reserves at 1.22 million tons.  The inventory in China adds to a glut in the world’s most-
used cooking oil, which is caught in a  bear market  as supply
expands to the biggest ever. Reserves in Malaysia, the largest
producer after  Indonesia , reached an all-time high in December.
Futures in  Kuala Lumpur  fell for an eighth day today, poised for
the worst run since 2006.  “China’s imports have been excessive, and we have yet to
see a pickup in demand,” said Chen Kai, an analyst at Shanghai
Pansun Information & Technology Co., a Shanghai-based oilseed
researcher. “Prices may continue to weaken.”  Most-active crude palm futures fell 1.2 percent to end at
2,368 ringgit ($763) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange
for a 28 percent decline in the past year. Refined palm was at
6,608  yuan  ($1,062) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange , down
20 percent in the past 12 months.  The latest reserves estimate from state-owned Grain.gov.cn,
a unit of the China National Grain & Oils Information Center, is
130,000 tons higher than a week ago and compares with 1.12
million tons on Feb. 1. The year-ago figure was 870,000 tons.  Quarantine Inspections  Imports in December, when traders took earlier shipments to
avoid stricter quarantine inspections from Jan. 1., surged to a
record 954,087 tons, 46 percent higher than November, according
to customs data. January’s imports were 472,733 tons.  China’s imports from  Malaysia  slumped 15 percent to 246,290
tons in February from a month earlier, according to data from
surveyor  Societe Generale  de Surveillance yesterday. Total
exports from Malaysia declined 8.8 percent, the data show.  Global stockpiles will gain to a record 7.203 million tons
this season, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Output in Malaysia will total 18.9 million tons in 2013,
matching the biggest-ever crop in 2011, the Malaysian Palm Oil
Board forecasts. Indonesia may harvest a record 30 million tons,
Derom Bangun, chairman of that nation’s board, said on Feb. 18.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
