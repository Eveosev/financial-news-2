The Libyan Investment Authority, the
nation’s sovereign wealth fund, is cooperating with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission on its probe into the fund’s
dealings with  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)   The LIA is also considering legal action against Goldman
Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, to recover losses
on its investments, the fund said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. The SEC has been investigating possible violations of
U.S. anti-corruption laws by Goldman Sachs for more than a year.
Reuters reported the LIA’s cooperation yesterday.  John Nester , an SEC spokesman, and  Michael DuVally , a
Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to comment when contacted by
Bloomberg News yesterday.  Under Muammar Qaddafi, the sovereign wealth fund had assets
of about $60 billion and turned to financial firms including
Goldman Sachs to achieve its goal of 8 percent annual returns.
The bets didn’t always work out, leading to losses of $1.75
billion on structured products bought in 2007 and 2008, $900
million of which was with Goldman Sachs, the fund’s former
chairman said in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
