Indonesian 10-year  government bonds 
dropped for a fourth day, pushing the yield to a 12-week high,
as February inflation topped estimates. The rupiah fell.  Consumer prices rose 5.31 percent, compared with 4.57
percent in January, official data showed today. That was more
than the 4.81 percent median estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. A separate report today showed a trade  shortfall  of
$171 million in January.  The yield on the government’s 5.625 percent bonds due May
2023 rose three basis points today and 10 basis points this week,
to 5.38 percent as of 4:35 p.m. in Jakarta, prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association show. That was the biggest
weekly advance since Jan. 11. The yield on sovereign two-year
notes dropped eight basis points this week and five basis points
today to 4.25 percent.  “Inflation was much higher than expected, so we may see
the 10-year bond yields adjust to as high as 5.6 percent,” said
Dini Anggraeni, a fixed-income analyst at PT Mandiri Sekuritas,
a unit of the nation’s largest lender by assets. “There seems
to be a shift from longer-term bonds to the shorter term as
investors seek security.”  The rupiah fell 0.1 percent to 9,675 per dollar, the most
since Feb. 21, prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg
show. It gained 0.4 percent this week. One-month implied
volatility in the rupiah, which measures expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, dropped five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.8 percent.  One-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.1 percent to
9,690, a 0.2 percent discount to the spot rate, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. A daily  fixing  used to settle rupiah derivatives
was set at 9,681 today, from 9,669 yesterday, by the Association
of Banks in  Singapore .  To contact the reporter on this story:
