Poland’s economy benefited from
having its own currency with a flexible exchange rate during the
global economic crisis, central bank economists said in a study
that comes as the nation debates adopting the euro.  The European Union’s biggest eastern economy, the only one
in the 27-member bloc to avoid a recession after the crisis
began in 2008, would have seen greater volatility had it used
the euro instead of the zloty between 2007 and 2012, according
to the  report  posted on the Warsaw-based bank’s website today.  “During the analyzed period, an independent monetary
policy and, in particular, a flexible exchange rate played an
important stabilizing role for the Polish economy,” according
to the study by Michal Brzoza-Brzezina, Krzystof Makarski and
Grzegorz Wesolowski of the bank’s Economic Institute.  Premier Donald Tusk has revived a debate about adopting
Europe’s currency, which Poland pledged to eventually do after
joining the EU in 2004. While the government has said it won’t
set a date for the switchover because the economy still needs
revamping, Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski said today that the
nation risks a “dramatic marginalization” outside the euro.  With the euro, gross domestic product would have oscillated
between a 6 percent contraction and growth of 9 percent between
2007 and 2012, rather than  expanding  between 1 percent and 7
percent, wrote the economists, who expressed their own views and
not necessarily those of the central bank. Inflation would also
have been more volatile with Europe’s single currency, the study
concluded.  As the crisis spiked in 2009, “risk premium shocks hit the
economy in a way that caused stabilizing exchange-rate
movements” to the zloty, the study said. “Fixing the exchange
rate would have removed this protection.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
