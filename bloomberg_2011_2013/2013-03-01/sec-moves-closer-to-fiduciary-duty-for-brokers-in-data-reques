The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission took a preliminary step toward setting a new standard
for brokers’ conduct with customers, asking the industry for
input on a potential rule.  Authorized by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and advocated by a
2011 staff study, the SEC  requested  information today from the
industry and public on costs and benefits of requiring brokers
to give personalized investment advice that’s in the best
interest of clients. The current standard for brokers is lower,
requiring that they sell products to clients that are suitable
for them at the time of sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
