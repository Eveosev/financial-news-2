Jefferies Bache LLC took delivery of
about 152,763 metric tons of sugar in transactions involving New
York futures contracts, amid shipping bottlenecks in  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer and exporter.  Jefferies took delivery on 3,007 expiring March contracts
on ICE Futures U.S., data on the exchange’s website showed
today. That compares with 17,325 contracts delivered against the
March contract last year, ICE data show. The delivery was the
smallest for the March contract since 2006, according to
Kingsman SA, a Swiss research company.  A record backlog for grain shipments at Brazil’s Port of
Santos last month is also delaying sugar exports from the
country. As of yesterday, 1.35 million tons of sugar was at
Brazil’s main ports compared with 270,600 tons a year earlier,
according to  data  from SA Commodities in Santos, Brazil,
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The delivery was the smallest in seven years and
basically is due to the absence of Brazilian sugar,” Michael McDougall, a senior vice president for Newedge Group in New
York, said in an e-mail. “We believe this has to do with brisk
demand for Brazilian sugar in late 2012 and early 2013 and
concern over the logistic bottleneck being caused by record corn
and soy crop exports.”  Firms including ADM Investor Services, J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC, Jefferies Bache, Term Commodities, and UBS
Securities LLC will deliver the sweetener, ICE data show. The
supplies were at ports in El Salvador,  Honduras , Costa Rica and
in Brazil, the exchange said.  Raw-sugar futures for May delivery dropped 2.2 percent to
17.99 cents a pound at 11:29 a.m. on ICE in New York, heading
for the biggest loss since Feb. 14. Prices slid 2.1 percent last
month, the second straight decline.  The contract for March delivery expired yesterday, and
today is the so-called first notice day, when traders must
indicate whether they intend to accept physical supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
