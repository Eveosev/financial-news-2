Electricity for next-day delivery in
Poland increased as unplanned outages of power units at the
country’s largest utility were set to cut supply.  Electricity for delivery tomorrow advanced 2.3 percent from
a week ago to 151.04 zloty ($46.85) a megawatt-hour, exchange
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  PGE SA (PGE) , Poland’s largest utility, will halt 631 megawatts
of power capacity at its Belchatow and Turow plants tomorrow,
the company said.  Day-ahead electricity on the coupled markets of the  Czech
Republic  and  Slovakia  gained 1.4 percent from a week ago to
38.74 euros ($50.31) a megawatt-hour in a daily auction,
according to the countries’ market operators.  Hungarian day-
ahead power  settled 7.6 percent lower at 38.92 euros a megawatt-
hour from 42.11 euros a week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
