Chile’s peso fell to a one-week low
after a manufacturing slowdown in  China  pushed down the price of
copper, the Andean nation’s top export.  The peso touched 474.44 per  U.S. dollar , its lowest
intraday level since Feb. 21. The currency was down 0.2 percent
at 474 at 10:18 a.m. in Santiago and was poised for a 0.1
percent weekly decline.  “Copper is looking weak today after lower than expected
data from China and any signs of slower growth pushes the dollar
up,” Daniel Soto, a portfolio manager at ForexChile, said in a
telephone interview today. “Strong domestic fundamentals, such
as low unemployment and inflation, are keeping the peso from
weakening even further.”  Copper fell as much as 2.1 percent to $3.4725 a pound in
 New York  after China reported that its official Purchasing
Manager’s Index was 50.1 in February, the weakest in five months
and down from 50.4 in January. A separate gauge of Chinese
manufacturing from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
dropped to a four-month low of 50.4 from 52.3. Readings above 50
indicate expansion.  Chilean policy makers were unanimous in their decision to
keep the benchmark  interest rate  unchanged last month after
internal demand showed no signs of slowing and inflation
remained below target, according to minutes of the central
bank’s Feb. 14 meeting released today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
