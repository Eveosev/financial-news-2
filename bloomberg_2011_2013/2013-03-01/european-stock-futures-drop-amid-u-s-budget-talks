European (SXXP)  stocks declined, following
nine months of gains for the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index, as measures
of manufacturing in the U.K. and  China  dropped, while a report
showed euro-area unemployment has climbed to a record.  Rio Tinto  Group contributed the most to a slide by a gauge
of European commodity producers.  Belgacom SA (BELG)  sank to the lowest
price since its initial public offering in 2004 after its
forecast for 2013 missed projections.  Royal Vopak NV (VPK)  dropped the
most in more than four years after operating profit fell in
2012.  Thales SA (HO)  jumped the most in 13 years after posting full-
year profit that beat analysts’ projections.  The Stoxx 600 retreated 0.3 percent to 289.02 at the close
in  London , paring an earlier slide of as much as 1.1 percent.
The gauge has advanced 0.2 percent this week. The equity
benchmark has  risen 3.3 percent  this year as U.S. lawmakers
agreed on a budget avoiding automatic fiscal changes that had
threatened to push the world’s biggest economy into recession.  “The market is focusing on macroeconomic data including
the bad euro-zone jobless rate, bad Italian unemployment and PMI
numbers,” said John Plassard, a vice president at Mirabaud
Securities LLP in Geneva, which oversees about $28 billion.
“The market is also focusing on the budget talks in the U.S.”  Budget Talks  President  Barack Obama  summoned congressional leaders to
the White House today to discuss the automatic spending cuts.
The president has until 11:59 p.m. in  Washington  to sign the
order that makes the cuts take effect. The reductions will total
$1.2 trillion over nine years, with $85 billion coming into
force in the remaining seven months of this fiscal year.  Unemployment in the 17-nation euro area rose to 11.9
percent in January from a revised 11.8 percent in December, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
That was the highest since the data series started in 1995 and
greater than the 11.8 percent  median estimate  of 33 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey.  A measure of  manufacturing in the U.K.  unexpectedly dropped
last month. The PMI compiled by  Markit Economics  and the
 Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply  retreated to 47.9
from a revised 50.5 in January.  China’s manufacturing  growth unexpectedly slowed last
month. The country’s official purchasing managers’ index slipped
to 50.1 in February from 50.4 in January, the National Bureau of
Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said
today in Beijing. The reading compared with the 50.5  median
estimate  in a Bloomberg News survey of 31 economists. A number
above 50 means that activity increased.  U.S. Manufacturing  European stocks pared their decline after the  Institute for
Supply Management ’s  U.S. factory index  increased to 54.2 last
month from 53.1 a month earlier. Economists had projected the
gauge would decline to 52.5, according to the median forecast in
a Bloomberg survey.  National benchmark indexes dropped in 11 of the 18 western-
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 added 0.3 percent,
France’s CAC 40 lost 0.6 percent, while Germany’s DAX retreated
0.4 percent.  Rio Tinto retreated 2.8 percent to 3,442 pence as a gauge
of mining companies posted the largest decline of the 19
industry groups in the Stoxx 600.  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  slumped 4.7 percent to 590 pence. Liberum
Capital Ltd. downgraded Kazakhstan’s biggest copper producer to
hold from buy, citing higher unit costs at its businesses.  Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  dropped 2.7 percent to 377
pence. The largest publicly traded commodities supplier said it
will miss its March 15 deadline to complete the $33 billion
takeover of Xstrata Plc. Glencore said that it needs approval
from China before it can conclude the deal. Xstrata slid 3.1
percent to 1,127 pence.  Belgacom, Vopak  Belgacom plunged 5.6 percent to 20.21 euros after Belgium’s
largest phone company forecast earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization of 1.69 billion euros ($2.2
billion) to 1.73 billion euros for 2013. The  average analyst
estimate  had predicted Ebitda of 1.75 billion euros this year.  Vopak tumbled 11 percent to 48.90 euros, falling the most
since November 2008. The world’s largest oil and chemical
storage company reported an 8.5 percent drop in full-year
operating profit to 536 million euros. Vopak’s chief financial
officer said Ebitda will grow by less than 10 percent in 2013.  Deutsche Bank AG lost 4.3 percent to 33.57 euros. Germany’s
largest bank was downgraded to sell from neutral at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. Deutsche Bank may have to transfer more than
$13 billion to its U.S. unit to meet capital rules for foreign
banks proposed by the  Federal Reserve , according to the
brokerage.  Lloyds Slides  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  declined 2.2 percent to 53.3
pence. Britain’s biggest mortgage lender posted its third
consecutive annual loss and indicated that profit margins will
fall short of analyst estimates.  Thales surged 12 percent to 30.30 euros, dropping the most
since February 2000. Europe’s biggest defense-electronics maker
posted a 24 percent increase in earnings for 2012, helped by
higher deliveries of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. airliners, for
which it supplies avionics.  Earnings before interest and taxes  rose to 927 million
euros from 749 million euros, the company said late yesterday.
Earnings from Thales’s commercial aerospace business jumped 37
percent, while demand from military customers declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
