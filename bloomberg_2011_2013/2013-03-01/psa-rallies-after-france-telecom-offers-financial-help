Telekomunikacja Polska SA (TPS) , Poland’s
largest phone company, jumped the most in more than two years
after  France Telecom  SA, its controlling shareholder, offered
financial help.  The  shares  rose 6.9 percent in Warsaw, the biggest gain
since Jan. 3, 2011. The stock has been the worst-performing in
the benchmark  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  in 2013, slumping 41 percent after
TPSA, as the Warsaw-based company is known, cut its dividend
plans and earnings worsened.  TPSA “has decided to take advantage of France Telecom’s
funding capabilities in order to optimize its financial cost,”
it said in a statement late yesterday. The company, in which
France Telecom has a 49 percent  stake , has seen revenue decline
since 2007 as competition increased and the country’s phone
regulator forced operators to cut prices.  “Investors are reacting positively to the fact TPSA has
managed to organize financing from its parent company,” Konrad Ksiezopolski, a Warsaw-based analyst Espirito Santo Investment
Bank, said by phone today. “Liquidity is crucial, especially
when all players in the domestic industry are waging a war.”  The funding will help boost TPSA financial standing as the
company has 400 million-euro  credit line  maturing this year as
well as 700 million euros of  bonds  due next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
