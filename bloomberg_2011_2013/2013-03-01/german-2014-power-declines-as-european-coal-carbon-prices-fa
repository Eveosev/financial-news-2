Power for 2014 in  Germany , Europe’s
biggest economy, fell as coal dropped to a record and emissions
allowances declined.  Baseload German 2014 electricity, for supplies delivered
around the clock, slipped 0.6 percent, while coal lost 0.5
percent and carbon permits for December slid 2.4 percent. Power
can track emissions and coal, which affect production costs.  The benchmark power contract declined 25 cents to 42.15
euros ($54.93) a megawatt-hour at 11:04 a.m. Berlin time,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. European 2014
coal for delivery to Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp lost as much as
65 cents to $97.50 a metric ton a record since the contract
started trading in January 2010, before changing hands at
$97.65.  EU carbon permits fell as much as 17 cents to 4.73 euros a
ton on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London before trading
at 4.83 euros.  April power in Germany was unchanged at 38.60 euros a
megawatt-hour while the equivalent French contract slid 0.6
percent to 43 euros, broker data show.  EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG (EBK)  had an unplanned halt at
its 508MW coal-fed Rostock power plant, the company said on its
website.  EON SE delayed the start of its 757-megawatt Wilhelmshaven
coal-fed plant until tomorrow. The plant halted on Feb. 26 for
“corrective maintenance” the company said on its website.  Electricite de France SA  had unplanned halts at its 1,330-
megawatt Paluel-4 and 915-megawatt Tricastin-1 nuclear power
plants, French grid operator RTE said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
