Electricite de France SA and  Morgan
Stanley (MS) ’s Paris offices were raided as part of German
prosecutors’ probe into the 4.7 billion-euro ($6.1 billion)
repurchase of a stake in  EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG. (EBK)   The raids took place last week at the request of Stuttgart
prosecutors who are investigating former Baden-Wuerttemberg
state Prime Minister Stefan Mappus and Dirk Notheis, the former
head of Morgan Stanley’s German business. EDF and Morgan Stanley
aren’t targets in the case, prosecutors’ spokesman Jan Dietzel
said by phone today.  “We call this ‘searches at third persons,’ meaning we are
raiding places where we think there may be evidence,” Dietzel
said. “You can raid premises of suspects, or of people who
maybe are witnesses -- and the latter was the case here.”  The Stuttgart probe is looking at whether Mappus misused
his power to authorize the state’s repurchase of a 45 percent
stake in EnBW from EDF without involving legislators. Morgan
Stanley advised the state government on the deal. Notheis left
the bank shortly after the probe became public.  Baden-Wuerttemberg has also started arbitration over the
price on the December 2010 stake purchase, which it claims was
too high.  EDF and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, as did Wolf
Schiller, Notheis’s attorney. Stephan Holthoff-Pfoertner, a
lawyer for Mappus, didn’t immediately return calls seeking
comment. Frank Mastiaux, EnBW’s chief executive officer,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
