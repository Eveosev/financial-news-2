The euro may fall to a five-month
low versus the dollar after breaking the neckline of a bullish
head-and-shoulders chart formation, according to Bank of America
Corp.  The 17-nation currency breached the neckline around $1.30
and may weaken to $1.2662, the lowest level since Nov. 13, said
 MacNeil Curry , chief rates and technical strategist at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch in  New York , by phone. Signs of euro-zone
economic weakness also back the bearish short-term trend, he
said.  “The European peripheral  debt market  has turned to the
bearish side and equities are coming down,” Curry said. “We’re
in a negative environment for the euro. It has lower to go.”  After weakening to $1.2662, the currency may resume its
“larger bull trend” and strengthen, Curry wrote in a note to
investors yesterday.  The shared currency fell 0.6 percent to $1.2979 per euro in
New York trading, after dropped to $1.2967, the lowest level
since Dec. 11. The euro’s 14-day relative strength index versus
the dollar approached 30 today, a level that may signal an asset
has fallen too far, too quickly.  The  difference  between generic two-year Italian and German
bonds is 191 basis points, or 1.91 percent, after narrowing to
117 basis points Jan. 17. The differential between Spanish and
German debt is 246 basis points, rising from the Jan. 11 low of
1.99 percent.  The Euro STOXX 50 index fell 1.1 percent today and has
dropped 4.9 percent since its recent Jan. 30 high. Stocks have
declined as measures of manufacturing in the U.K. dropped and a
report showed euro-area unemployment has climbed to a record
high.  “If you are betting on the euro simply being oversold
you’re going to be taken out in a casket,”  Tom Fitzpatrick ,
chief technical analyst at Citigroup Inc. in New York, said in a
telephone interview. “Just as a market can remain irrational
longer than you can remain solvent, a market can remain
overbought longer than you can remain solvent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
