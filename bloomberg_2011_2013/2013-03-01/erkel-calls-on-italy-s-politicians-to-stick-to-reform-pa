German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
urged Italy to stick to the path of reform after the success of
anti-austerity parties in February’s election.  “Now in  Europe  after the Italian elections it seems to be
a case of either austerity and savings programs or growth, but
that’s a completely false premise,” Merkel said today in a
speech to an event in northeastern Germany hosted by her
Christian Democratic Union party.  Her stance on cutting deficits is “not about liking to
whip people,” Merkel told CDU members in Greifswald, in her
electoral district. Budget cuts are not incompatible with
growth, rather growth depends on sound finances, she said.  Political instability looms in Italy after Pier Luigi Bersani failed to gain control of parliament at the Feb. 24-25
election as former Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  and Beppe Grillo won blocking minorities in the Senate. Bersani has said
he aims to ease the reforms imposed by outgoing Prime Minister
 Mario Monti , while Grillo is anti-austerity and Berlusconi has
criticised cuts “imposed by Germany.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
