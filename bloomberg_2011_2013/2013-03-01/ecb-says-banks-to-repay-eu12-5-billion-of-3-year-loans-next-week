The European Central Bank said banks
will repay 12.5 billion euros ($16.3 billion) of three-year
loans next week.  Some 12 banks will return 4.18 billion euros borrowed in
the  first  emergency operation, and 54 banks will hand back 8.32
billion euros of the  second  offering of long-term funds, the
Frankfurt-based ECB said in a statement. That takes the total
amount of money repaid early to 224.8 billion euros, or 22
percent of the overall amount lent.  The ECB flooded banks with more than 1 trillion euros in
two three-year loans after money markets froze because of
 Europe â€™s debt crisis. Banks have the option of repaying the
funds after a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
