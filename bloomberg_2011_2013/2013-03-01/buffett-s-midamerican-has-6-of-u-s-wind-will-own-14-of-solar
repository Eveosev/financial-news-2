Warren Buffett ’s MidAmerican Energy
Holdings Co. accounts for 6 percent of U.S. wind-energy capacity
and will generate about 14 percent of the nation’s solar power
when it finishes three solar farms under development.  When the projects are complete, the company will have
invested about $13 billion in its renewable-energy portfolio,
Buffett wrote in his annual letter to shareholders today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
