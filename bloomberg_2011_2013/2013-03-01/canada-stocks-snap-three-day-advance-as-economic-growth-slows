Canadian  stocks  fell for the first
time in four days after data showed the economy grew at its
slowest pace since 2011 and a measure of China’s manufacturing
missed forecasts.  Atlantic Power Corp. (ATP)  plunged 29 percent as the electric
power company cut its dividend 65 percent after reporting worse-
than-estimated fourth-quarter earnings.  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE)  and
Suncor Energy Inc. slumped at least 1.1 percent as the price of
crude slipped to its lowest level this year.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 48.71
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,773.12 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
S&P/TSX rose 0.6 percent for the week.  “On the global scene you have softer PMI data in China and
in the U.K.,” said Michael O’Brien, director and fund manager
with TD Asset Management Inc. in Toronto. He manages about C$3
billion ($3 billion). “It’s reminding people that this isn’t a
straight-line recovery, that there will be bumps in the road.
There are still things that need to heal.”  The official Purchasing Managers’ Index in  China  was 50.1
in February, the weakest in five months and down from 50.4 in
January, a report from the National Bureau of Statistics and
China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing showed today in
Beijing. A gauge of U.K. manufacturing based on a survey of
purchasing managers slid to 47.9 last month from a revised 50.5
in January, according to Markit Economics and the Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply.  Canada GDP  Canada’s  gross domestic product  grew at a 0.6 percent
annualized pace from October to December, the slowest since the
second quarter of 2011, as gains in investment and consumer
spending were blunted by companies scaling back inventories.  Raw-materials companies  contributed  the most to losses in
the S&P/TSX as seven of 10 industries retreated. Trading volume
was 2.2 percent lower than the 30-day average.  Barrick Gold Corp. dropped 3.4 percent to C$30.20 after
gold for April delivery fell 0.4 percent to settle at $1,572.30
an ounce in New York, capping a fourth straight week of
declines.  Atlantic Power lost C$2.96 to C$7.30, for its biggest
decline since listing in 2004. The company cut its annual
 dividend  65 percent to 40 Canadian cents a share after reporting
a wider loss than analysts forecast.  Cenovus lost 65 Canadian cents to C$32.74 and Suncor
slipped 35 Canadian cents to C$30.90 as crude for April delivery
tumbled 1.5 percent to settle at $90.68 a barrel, the lowest
level since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
