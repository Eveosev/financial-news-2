The U.K. government is selling
$150,000 of valuable French wine as part of its austerity drive.  Six lots of  Bordeaux  with trophy labels such as Chateau
Latour, Lafite and Petrus will be auctioned from the Government
Hospitality Cellar at Christie’s International in  London  on
March 21.  Ranging in vintage from 1961 to 1988, they have been
estimated to raise as much as 65,000 pounds ($152,000) at hammer
prices, the auction house said in an e-mailed release today.  “I warmly welcome this auction of wine from the Government
Wine Cellar,” Foreign Office Minister Mark Simmonds said in the
statement. “This is part of the process for making the cellar
self-funding for the lifetime of the current parliament.”  The wine will be sold at a time when the market for
 France ’s trophy clarets has revived after buying from  China 
declined in early-to-mid-2012. The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index,
which tracks trading in the 10 most recent vintages of
Bordeaux’s five first-growths, was at 321.58 on Feb. 28 after
slumping to a two-and-a-half-year low of 293.10 in November.  Auctions of investment-grade wine at Christie’s and
 Sotheby’s (BID)  in London in February registered success rates of 97
and 98 percent respectively and totals at both sales exceeded
their upper estimates.  The U.K.’s Government Hospitality Cellar is located in the
basement of Lancaster House, a 19th-century mansion opposite St.
James’s Palace used for official receptions and banquets.  Cellar Direct  The wines being offered at Christie’s have been removed
directly from the cellar, where they’ve matured after being
bought young -- and at far lower prices -- from merchants, the
auction house specialists said.  Six bottles of Chateau Latour from the legendary 1961
vintage is the most highly priced lot at 20,000 pounds to 30,000
pounds.  Full cases of Chateau Le Pin and Chateau Mouton-
Rothschild’s 1986 vintages carry upper estimates of 10,000
pounds and 6,000 pounds. Six bottles of Chateau Petrus 1970 are
also catalogued to sell for as much as 6,000 pounds. A case of
Lafite-Rothschild ’88 is priced at 6,000 pounds to 8,000 pounds.  “These vintages are too valuable to drink,” Susan Crown,
a Foreign Office spokeswoman, said in an interview. “It was
never the intention to buy expensive wine. Their sale will help
pay for the running of the cellar and the purchase of less
expensive ones.”  Formal valuations of the U.K. government’s wine cellar are
regularly submitted to parliament. Though these may result in
further sales, high-quality French wines will continue to be
poured at Lancaster House functions, Crown said.  “When President Obama comes to dinner, you can’t serve him
Lambrini,” she said.  To be sure, the sale will not improve the government’s
budgetary standing significantly. Britain’s debt as a percentage
of gross domestic product will climb to 98 percent next year
from 90 percent last year and 95.4 percent in 2013, the European
Commission said in its winter forecast on Feb. 22.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art and wine markets for
