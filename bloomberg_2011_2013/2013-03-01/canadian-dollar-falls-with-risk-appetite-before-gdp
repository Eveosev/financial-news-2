The Canadian dollar fell to its
lowest level in eight months against its U.S. counterpart before
of a report expected to show the economy contracted in December.  The currency fell against the majority of its most traded
peers before a release expected to show gross domestic product
fell 0.2 percent in the last month of last year, leaving fourth
quarter growth unchanged from the quarter before at 0.6 percent,
according to two Bloomberg surveys of economists. Crude oil, the
nation’s largest export, fell to its lowest price this year.  “Just a lot of negative sentiment to the Canadian dollar
right now, and just risk assets in general,” said Blake Jespersen, managing director of foreign exchange at Bank of
Montreal, by phone from Toronto. If the GDP numbers miss
expectations “this trend will continue and you’ll probably see
Canadian dollar below C$1.0350 against the U.S.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the water fowl on the C$1 coin, fell 0.1 percent to C$1.0317
per U.S. dollar at 7:41 a.m. in Toronto. Earlier it touched
C$1.0330 per U.S. dollar, it’s weakest since June 29. One loonie
buys 96.93 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
