Western democracy prides itself on
the ability to adapt to changing times.  It is now headed for “terminal political decay,”
threatened by gridlock, debt and deficits, income inequality and
corruption, according to billionaire  Nicolas Berggruen , author
of “Intelligent Governance for the 21st Century.”  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  He points out that in the U.S., for example, as significant
wealth was becoming concentrated in the financial sector -- by
2005 it accounted for 40 percent of all business profits -- the
middle class came under growing pressure.  Well-paying jobs disappeared. Tech firms tend to need fewer
employees:  Facebook (FB)  has about 3,500.  Apple (AAPL)  in the U.S. has
43,000, while the iPhone is made in China by Foxconn, with 1.2
million workers.  To survive the current crisis, Berggruen says we need to
radically reform the way we govern ourselves.  I spoke with him on the following topics:  1. Crises of Governance  2. Popularity Vs. Ability  3. Informed Citizens  4. Global Interdependence  5.
