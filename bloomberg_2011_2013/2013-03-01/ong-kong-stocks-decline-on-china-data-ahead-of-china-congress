Hong Kong  stocks fell, with the
city’s benchmark index dropping the first time in three days, as
data showed the pace of China’s manufacturing expansion
unexpectedly slowed ahead of a National People’s Congress next
week that will set this year’s growth target.  Citic Pacific Ltd., which manufactures steel, slid 5.5
percent for its 10th decline in 12 days. Jiangxi Copper Co.
retreated 2.5 percent, pacing declines among resource shares.

biggest developer cut its home sales target amid government
efforts to curb price gains.  The Hang Seng Index lost 0.6 percent to 22,880.22 at the
close, trimming the week’s gains to 0.4 percent. About twice as
many stocks declined as gained, with trading volume 23 percent
above its 30-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index of mainland
companies fell 0.8 percent to 11,344.24.  “We are still waiting for the congress,” said Linus Yip,
a Hong Kong-based strategist at First Shanghai Securities Ltd.
“The major concern is whether there will be more controls
coming out.”  The city’s benchmark index has retreated 3.6 percent since
the end of January, when it reached a 20-month high, as the
city’s government added property curbs and China signaled it may
take steps to cool its housing market. The gauge traded at 11.1

Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.4 for the Stoxx Europe 600

China’s new government takes power this month after the annual
session of parliament.  China  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was 50.1 in February,
compared with 50.4 in January, the National Bureau of Statistics
said. The figure for last month compares with economist’s
estimates for 50.5.  A separate manufacturing gauge from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics showed a reading of 50.4, the lowest in four
months. The median estimate from 14 analysts for the final level
is 50.6. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Industrial and resource stocks declined. Citic Pacific fell
5.5 percent to HK$11.26.  Aluminum Corp. of China  retreated 4.8
percent to 3.19.  Jiangxi Copper slid 2.5 percent to HK$18.12. PetroChina

government-owned land only after receiving guarantees of minimum
bids from developers, Secretary for Development  Paul Chan  said
yesterday. The selling will be determined by the government
based on the needs of the market to ensure land supply can be
increased, he said.  China Life Insurance Co. (2628)  dropped 0.6 percent to HK$23.15
after the nation’s biggest insurer said profit probably fell

increased impairment losses due to weakness in  capital markets .  Nexon Losses  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , a state-owned Chinese offshore energy explorer,
