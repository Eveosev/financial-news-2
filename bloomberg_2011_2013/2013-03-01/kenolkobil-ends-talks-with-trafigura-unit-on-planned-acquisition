KenolKobil Ltd. (KNOC) , a Kenyan fuel
retailer with operations in nine African countries, said it
ended talks on Puma Energy BV’s planned acquisition of a
controlling stake.  Negotiations have been “terminated,” the Nairobi-based
company said in an e-mailed statement today, without giving a
reason. KenolKobil will pursue “strategic alternatives” to
support its growth strategy across central, eastern and southern
 Africa . The discussions were ended by mutual agreement, Puma
said in a separate statement.  KenolKobil began talks with Puma, the Geneva-based
downstream and storage unit of Trafigura Beheer BV, in May and
the company’s “key” shareholders signed an agreement to sell
their majority stake. Puma said it would offer to buy 100
percent of the company after due diligence and regulatory
approval.  KenolKobil’s shares climbed as much as 36 percent after the
talks were announced on May to a record 16.95 shillings on July
3. The stock fell as much as 3.7 percent today before closing
unchanged at 13.5 shillings.  No one answered the phone at KenolKobil’s head office  when
Bloomberg called Managing Director  Jacob Segman  for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
