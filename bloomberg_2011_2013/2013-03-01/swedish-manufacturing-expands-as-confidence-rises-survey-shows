Swedish manufacturing  expanded for
the first time since July last month as exporters grew more
confident of a recovery in debt-stricken Europe.  An index based on responses from about 200  purchasing
managers  rose to a seasonally adjusted 50.9 in February from
49.2 the previous month, Stockholm-based  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , which
compiles the index, said today. A reading below 50 signals a
contraction. The  average estimate  of nine economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a reading of 50.  “Manufacturers continued to revise up their production
plans, and the sub-index for production indicated growth for a
second month,” Swedbank said in a statement. “These could be
signs that the manufacturing slowdown has bottomed out.”  Sweden’s central bank kept its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at 1 percent last month, after four reductions since
the end of 2011 to support growth in the largest Nordic economy.  The production sub-index rose to 54.8 from 53.8, while the
order index climbed to 51.1 from 49.7. The employment index
increased to 45.3 from 40.8. the production plan index gained to
57.9 from 54.8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
