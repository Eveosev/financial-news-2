Canadian heavy  crude oil  weakened to
the lowest discount in three weeks against futures as pending
maintenance at Midwestern refineries was expected to cut into
demand.  Plants that process heavy crude imports from  Canada  were
said to have scheduled maintenance for April and May, including
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s 238,000-barrel-a-day Joliet,  Illinois , units
and  Calumet Specialty Products Partners (CLMT) ’ 45,000-barrel-a-day
refinery in Superior,  Wisconsin .  Western Canada Select, a heavy bitumen blend, weakened
$1.95 a barrel to a $27.90 discount versus U.S. benchmark West
Texas Intermediate crude, said Calgary oil broker Net Energy
Inc. It was the largest discount for the grade since Feb. 6,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Exxon’s  Joliet refinery  will shut down for five weeks of
maintenance starting in mid-April, a person familiar with the
matter said. Calumet said it will close its  Superior refinery 
late in the first quarter for about three weeks of work.  Syncrude, a light grade produced from oil-sands bitumen,
gained $2 against WTI to trade at a $5 premium as of 2:08 p.m.
 New York  time, according to data collected by Bloomberg. It was
the highest premium for the grade since Oct. 9.  Gulf of Mexico  crudes strengthened on the  spot market  as
benchmark West Texas Intermediate’s discount to  Brent crude 
widened.  WTI-Brent  WTI weakened 39 cents to a  discount  of $19.69 a barrel at
2:54 p.m. in New York. When Brent gains versus WTI, it typically
strengthens the value of U.S. grades that compete with foreign
oils priced against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 15 cents a
barrel to a $21.50 premium. Light Louisiana Sweet gained 35
cents a barrel to trade at $20.90 over WTI.  Mars Blend’s premium to WTI rose by 25 cents to $16.75 a
barrel, while Poseidon’s premium gained 50 cents to $16.85 a
barrel over WTI. The premium for  Thunder Horse , which has a
lower sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green,
narrowed by 25 cents to $18.75.  Bakken crude delivered at Clearbrook,  Minnesota , gained
$1.50 a barrel to trade at a $1.50-a-barrel discount to WTI.  To contact the reporters on this story:
