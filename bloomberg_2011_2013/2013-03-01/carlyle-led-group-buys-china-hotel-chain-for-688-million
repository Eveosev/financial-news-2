Carlyle Group LP (CG) , the second-biggest
private-equity firm by assets, agreed to buy Chinese budget-
hotel operator  7 Days Group Holdings Ltd. (SVN)  in a sweetened deal
valued at $688 million.  Carlyle is joining Sequoia Capital and Actis LLP to pay
$13.80 for each U.S. share for the Guangzhou, China-based
company, a 3.2 percent premium to yesterday’s closing price and
a 31 percent premium to the closing price on Sept. 25, the day
before 7 Days received the original buyout offer at $12.70 a
share. The buyer group received $120 million in bank financing
to help fund the deal, which is expected to close in the second
half of the year, the companies said in a statement today.  “ China  is now booming,” William Conway, Washington-based
Carlyle’s co-chief executive officer, said last week on a
conference call after the firm reported earnings. “China not
only didn’t experience a hard landing, but it’s arguably
experiencing a late-year boom and the central banks continue to
promote a world awash in liquidity.”  Carlyle’s latest Asia-dedicated buyout fund shows Conway’s
enthusiasm, with seven of its 10 investments in mainland China,
including a 49 percent stake in Mandarin Hotel Holdings Ltd.,
and one in Hong Kong, according to the firm’s  website . The $2.6
billion fund, which will make the investment in 7 Days, was
generating a negative 2 percent net internal rate of return and
a multiple of invested capital of 1.1 as of Dec. 31, according
to Carlyle’s most recent earnings report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
