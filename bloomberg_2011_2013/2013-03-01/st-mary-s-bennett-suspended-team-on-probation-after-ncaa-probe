St. Mary’s College of California 
basketball coach Randy Bennett was suspended for five games next
season and the team was placed on four years’ probation for
violations in recruiting and impermissible coaching and training
sessions, the  National Collegiate Athletic Association  said.  St. Mary’s, 25-5 this season and 13-2 in the West Coast
Conference, is ranked 23rd in the USA Today Coaches Poll. The
Gaels have played in the NCAA tournament four times in Bennett’s
11 previous years coaching the team, reaching the round of 16 in
2010.  Other sanctions handed down to the Moraga,  California ,
school’s men’s team included public reprimand and censure; a
two-year reduction of scholarships from 13 to 11; and
elimination of foreign tours until 2017-18 and multiple-team
events until 2015-16, the NCAA said today in a  news release.   It is allowed to play in the conference and national
postseason tournaments.  The school “failed to monitor its men’s basketball program
and a former assistant men’s basketball coach acted unethically
in his recruitment of international prospects,” the NCAA said,
citing the findings of its Division I Committee on Infractions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
