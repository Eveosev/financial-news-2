Deutsche Annington Immobilien AG,
Germany’s largest residential landlord, appointed a chief
executive officer before an initial public offering planned for
this year.  Rolf Buch, the former head of Bertelsmann SE unit Arvato
AG, will become CEO on April 1, Deutsche Annington said in a
statement today. The position had been vacant since Wijnand
Donkers, the last CEO, left the Bochum-based company in
September.  The hire allows Deutsche Annington, owned by  Guy Hands ’
Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd., to proceed with its plan to
sell shares to the public for the first time. In December,
Deutsche Annington received court approval to restructure
Europe’s largest corporate commercial mortgage-backed security.  Deutsche Annington is targeting July 4 for the IPO, a
person with knowledge of the plan said. The person asked not to
be identified because the information hadn’t been made public.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  will manage the IPO.  Since Donkers’ departure, the company has been led by Chief
Financial Officer A. Stefan Kirsten and Terra Firma Chief
Operating Officer Robert Barr.  Deutsche Annington owns 186,000 homes in Germany, making it
the company with the most number of residential units. The homes
were valued at 9.9 billion euros in its  2011 annual report ,
including about 6.7 billion euros in debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
