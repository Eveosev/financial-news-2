Nigeria ’s naira appreciated, paring
its biggest five-day decline in six weeks, as the central bank
sold the most dollars this year at an auction and  oil companies 
also sold the U.S. currency.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer gained 0.2
percent to 158.10 per dollar as of 4:10 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, giving a 0.4 percent retreat this week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $200 million at an auction
on Feb. 27, the most this year, bringing sales this week to $350
million, the highest in eight. Oil-producing companies, which
sell dollars to lenders around the month-end to meet local
spending needs, are the second-biggest source of foreign
currency after the central bank.  “The central bank’s sale this week was an intervention to
boost dollar supply and ease pressure on the naira,” Abubakar
Mohammed, chief executive of Lagos-based Forward Marketing
Bureau de Change Ltd., said by phone today. “Sales by oil
companies complemented official supply.”  The central bank stepped in this week by increasing
foreign-exchange sales as capital inflows from outside the
country reduced amid a more risk-averse global environment in
February,  Samir Gadio , an emerging-markets strategist at
Standard Bank Group Ltd., Africa’s largest bank by assets, said
yesterday.  The regulator held the benchmark  interest rate  at a record
high 12 percent for an eighth straight time on Jan. 21 to
control inflation and stabilize the naira. The nation’s
inflation rate fell to 9 percent in January from 12 percent in
December, the statistics bureau said Feb. 18.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 fell one basis point to 10.60 percent, according to
yesterday’s data compiled on the  Financial Markets Dealers
Association  website.  Yields on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January
2021 fell eight basis points to 4.334 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi was unchanged at 1.9175 per dollar in Accra,
the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
