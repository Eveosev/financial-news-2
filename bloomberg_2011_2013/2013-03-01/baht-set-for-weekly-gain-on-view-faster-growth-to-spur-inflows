Thailand ’s baht had a second weekly
advance as data boosted optimism the local economy is improving,
and as overseas funds increased holdings of the nation’s debt.  Imports climbed 41 percent in January, compared with 4.7
percent in December, while export gains quickened to 16 percent
from 13 percent, a government report showed on Feb. 27. Growth
in the Southeast Asian economy will exceed 5 percent this year,
Central bank Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said Feb. 26,
following a 6.4 percent expansion in 2012. International
investors bought $2.7 billion more sovereign notes than they
sold in February, Thai Bond Market Association data show.  “The central bank has quite a bullish growth outlook and
that is positive for further fund inflows,” said Tohru
Nishihama, an economist covering the global emerging countries
at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo . “A surge in
imports also shows domestic demand is strong, and that fits in
with the growth story.”  The baht strengthened 0.4 percent this week and 0.1 percent
today to 29.74 per dollar as of 3:23 p.m. in Bangkok, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, climbed 29 basis
points, or 0.29 percentage point, today to 5.28 percent and rose
three basis points from a week ago.  Industrial Output  Thailand posted a  current-account deficit  of $2.2 billion
in January, compared with a $730 million surplus in December,
while industrial output gained 10 percent, expanding for the
fourth straight month, official data showed yesterday. The
Office of Industrial Economics said yesterday the manufacturing
production index will rise between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent
this year, compared with a 2.51 percent gain last year.  The Bank of Thailand said yesterday local bonds attracted
$3.1 billion of inflows in January and stocks received $500
million.  The yield on the 3.625 percent government notes due June
2023 was little changed today at 3.62 percent and was up one
basis point from a week ago, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It
reached 3.58 percent on Feb. 27, the least since Feb. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
