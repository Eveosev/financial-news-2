Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG) , the insurer selling life units to focus on property-
casualty coverage, said a third-quarter restatement resulted in
a $38 million net loss for 2012 instead of previously reported
2012 net income of $350 million.  Shareholders’ equity was $22.4 billion instead of $22.8
billion, Hartford said today in statement. The company, named
after the Connecticut city where it’s based, said it found a
material weakness in its internal control reporting.  Hartford blamed an error in its preliminary calculation of
the Individual Life unit’s sale transaction, which it now says
included a $388 million loss. The company’s 2012 core  earnings 
of $1.4 billion are unchanged, according to Hartford.  “We regret the error, but importantly the adjustments have
no impact on our reported 2012 core earnings, statutory results
or surplus, and announced capital management plan,” Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Liam E. McGee said in the statement.  The shares were little changed in extended trading in New
York, dropping to $23.61 at 4:25 p.m. from the official close of
$23.68.  To contact the reporter on this story:
