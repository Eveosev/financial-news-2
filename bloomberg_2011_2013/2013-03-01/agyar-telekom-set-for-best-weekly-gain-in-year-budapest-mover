Magyar Telekom Nyrt., the Hungarian
phone unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , had its biggest weekly gain
in more than six months after a management proposal to maintain
the size of dividends pushed the stock to a key technical level.  The shares gained as much as 1.7 percent to 414 forint and
closed up 1 percent at 411 forint in Budapest, extending the
advance in the past five days to 6.2 percent, the most on a
closing basis since Aug. 17, 2012. Management proposed holding
the dividend at the 2010 and 2011 level of 50 forint per share,
the company said in a statement to the Budapest bourse yesterday
after reporting its first sales increase in five years in 2012.  The rally has pushed the stock to its 200-day moving
 average , which last stood at 414 forint, according to analysts
at Bayerische Landesbank’s MKB Bank unit and broker Equilor
Befektetesi Zrt.  “If it manages to break that, it usually means that a
significant rally follows,” Zsolt Balasy, a Budapest-based
equities analyst at MKB, wrote in a research report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
