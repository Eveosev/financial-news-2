Sibanye Gold Ltd., the South African
mining company spun off from  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  last month, rose
6.2 percent in Johannesburg after announcing a 16 percent
increase in full-year profit.  The stock advanced to 13.80 rand, its highest closing price
since Feb. 18, with 16.3 million shares traded, valuing the
company at 10.1 billion rand ($1.1 billion).  Net income rose to 3 billion rand, Johannesburg-based
Sibanye said in a statement today. About 85 percent of the
miner’s earnings were generated in the first half after labor
strikes hit production later in the year, it said.  “The results quantify explicitly the capacity of Sibanye’s
mines,” Percy Takunda, a mining analyst at Imara SP Reid, said
in a phone interview. “They managed to make money in a
difficult year. Assuming this year operations stabilize, they do
look like a profitable outfit.”  Gold Fields said in November it would place its deeper and
most labor-intensive South African mines in Sibanye. The shares
opened trading at 13.65 on Feb. 12 and hit a high of 16.20 rand
three days later before declining to as low as 12.85 rand on
Feb. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
