BP Plc (BP/) ’s Sangachal terminal south of
the Azeri capital of Baku exported less crude oil in 2012 as
output from the country’s largest deposit fell a second year.  The terminal shipped almost 282.9 million barrels of oil in
2012, down 3 percent, according to data e-mailed today by the BP
office in Baku. Of the total, 246.4 million barrels were shipped
through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan link and 29.1 million via the
Western Route Export Pipeline. Both are operated by BP.  Sangachal also shipped on average 21.1 million cubic meters
of gas a day, up from 18.2 million, according to the BP data.  The terminal’s processing capacity is 1.2 million barrels
of oil and 25.5 million cubic meters of gas a day, BP says.  The BP-led Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field in  Azerbaijan ’s
section of the  Caspian Sea  cut production 7 percent last year to
32.9 million tons, the data showed. The Shah Deniz phase-one gas
project, also operated by BP, raised output 16 percent to 7.73
billion cubic meters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
