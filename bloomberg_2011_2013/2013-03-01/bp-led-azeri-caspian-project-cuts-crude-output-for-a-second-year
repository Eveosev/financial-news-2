The BP Plc-led Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli
field in Azerbaijan’s section of the Caspian Sea cut oil output
for a second year, extending a drop that prompted criticism from
the nation and a pledge by the company to stabilize production.  Output from the largest Azeri deposit fell by 7 percent to
32.9 million metric tons, according to data e-mailed today by
BP’s office in the capital of Baku. It didn’t give any reason.  President  Ilham Aliyev  in October accused BP of “grave
mistakes” and demanded the replacement of those responsible for
the decline. London-based BP subsequently switched executives in
the region and said it planned “long-term stabilization of ACG
production,” which made up 77 percent of Azeri output in 2012.  State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, a partner in the project, said
in October output would be 33 million tons this year and rise to
35 million tons in 2014. It would hold at about 33 million to 34
million tons through 2020, President Rovnaq Abdullayev said.  ACG produced about 3.4 billion cubic meters of natural gas
in 2012, from about 3.3 billion, said BP, whose partners include
 Chevron Corp (CVX) ,  Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) ,  Inpex Corp (1605)  and  Statoil ASA. (STL)   Phase one of the BP-led Shah Deniz project, also in the
Azeri section of the  Caspian Sea , pumped about 7.73 billion
cubic meters of natural gas, up 16 percent, and 2 million tons
of condensate, or light oil, up from 1.8 million, data showed.  Shah Deniz will deliver an additional 16 billion cubic
meters of gas when the second phase of the project, estimated to
cost about $25 billion, begins production in 2018, BP said.  Azerbaijan plans to exports 10 billion cubic meters of the
fuel to the European Union through Georgia and  Turkey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
