Chinese stocks  fell in  New York ,
giving the benchmark index its longest weekly slump in nine
months, after manufacturing indexes showed a slower-than-
estimated pace of expansion in Asia’s largest economy.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. lost 0.1 percent to 94.08, capping
a four-week drop. Youku Tudou Inc.,  China ’s biggest web video
operator, fell to the lowest in seven weeks as sales came below
estimates.  SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) , a real estate information
website, slid on concern new property curbs will limit price
gains.  Ambow Education Holding Ltd. (AMBO) , a Chinese school operator,
tumbled 31 percent after being sued by investors.  China’s official  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was 50.1 in
February, the weakest level in five months, while a separate
gauge from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics also dropped
to a four-month low, a signal the nation’s economic recovery
from a seven-quarter slowdown may be losing steam. The China-US
gauge plunged 6.2 percent in February, the largest monthly
decline since May, as concern grew policy makers will take steps
to curb rising home prices.  The PMI “is a little off-putting,” Mark Luschini, the
chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC,
which manages $54 billion in assets including Chinese equities,
said in a telephone interview from Philadelphia yesterday. “It
would be worrisome if we start to see any monetary tightening
associated with that at a time when an economy looks like it
began to re-accelerate.”  Chinese ETF  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., declined 0.9 percent to
$38.60, paring this week’s gain to 0.2 percent. The  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  fell 0.2 percent to 1,518.20 yesterday.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  retreated 0.8 percent
to 11,344.24 yesterday, trimming the week’s gain to 0.2 percent,
while the Shanghai Composite Index of domestic Chinese shares
slipped 0.3 percent to 2,359.51, finishing the week up 2
percent.  Youku, based in Beijing, slid 1.7 percent to $20.05,
dropping 3 percent for the week.  The company, formed from a merger of China’s biggest video
websites, forecast first-quarter sales will be between 480
million yuan ($77.1 million) and 520 million  yuan , missing the
548.7 million yuan average projection of eight analysts compiled
by Bloomberg. Its fourth-quarter net loss of 113.6 million yuan
was smaller than analysts’ mean forecast of a loss of 138.8
million yuan, according to its statement on Feb. 28.  Price Estimates  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its share-price estimate for
Youku by 13 percent to $20 yesterday, while Nomura Holdings Inc.
reduced its forecast to $38 from $40.  SouFun, the biggest property information website in China,
slid 4.5 percent to $25.65 yesterday, extending its weekly drop
to 4.7 percent.  China’s new home prices rose for a ninth month February,
climbing 0.8 percent to 9,893 yuan ($1,590) per square meter
(10.76 square feet) from January, SouFun said in a statement
yesterday after a survey of 100 cities.  China told its central bank to raise down-payment
requirements and  interest rates  for second-home mortgages in
cities with “excessively fast” price gains, stepping up
efforts to cool the  property market . The People’s Bank of
China’s regional branches may implement the measures in
accordance with the price-control targets of local governments,
the central government said in a statement on its website
yesterday.  Ambow Education tumbled to $1.13, posting the biggest
weekly decline among the 55 stocks in the benchmark gauge. The
company was sued by investors who accuse it of orchestrating a
“fake acquisition” to facilitate an initial public offering in
the U.S. It dropped 3.4 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
