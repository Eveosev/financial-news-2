Vale SA (VALE5) , the third-largest mining
company, said the railroad that links the world’s biggest iron-
ore mine with a port terminal in northeastern Brazil was shut
after a partial derailment.  The incident, involving 11 of the train’s 30 cars, occurred
at about 3:47 a.m. local time at the Buriticupu municipality in
Maranhao state, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said in an e-
mailed statement today. The train was carrying diesel fuel and
Vale said it took measures to avoid environmental risks after
fuel leaked.  The 892-kilometer (554-mile) railway  connects  Vale’s
Carajas  iron-ore  mine with Maranhao’s Ponta da Madeira port.
Carajas produced 106.8 million metric tons of iron ore last
year, about 33 percent of the company’s total output, Vale said
Feb. 1.  The company ships manganese, copper and coal on the
railway, which also is used by a passenger train, according to
the company’s  website . Vale  dropped  3 percent to 35.45 reais at
1:49 p.m. in Sao Paulo.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and Rio Tinto Group are the two largest
mining companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
