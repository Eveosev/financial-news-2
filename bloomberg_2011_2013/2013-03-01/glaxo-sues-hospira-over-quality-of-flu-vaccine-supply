GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  sued  Hospira
Inc. (HSP)  seeking more than $25 million in damages over the quality
of influenza vaccine supplies.  London-based Glaxo’s Belgian biologicals unit alleges
Hospira agreed in 2010 to supply the vaccine for U.S. sales,
subsequently failed to meet quality standards, and canceled the
contract on March 22, 2012,, according to a complaint filed in
federal court yesterday in New York.  “Glaxo has now sustained substantial damages” and Lake
Forest, Illinois-based Hospira should pay at least $25 million
plus interest and legal fees, according to the complaint.  GlaxoSmithKline, with $41.8 billion in sales last year,
says Hospira, with $4 billion in annual sales, was to have
continued the contract until the end of 2015, said Hospira.  Tareta Adams, a spokeswoman for Hospira, declined to
comment on the lawsuit.  The case is GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA v. Hospira
Worldwide Inc., 13-cv-1395, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
