Warburg Pincus LLC chose  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  to lead an initial public offering of Bausch & Lomb
Inc. that would raise as much as $1.5 billion, said people with
knowledge of the matter.  The offering would give Bausch & Lomb, whose products
include  contact lenses  and eye-care solutions, an enterprise
value of $9 billion to $10 billion, said the people, who asked
not to be named because the information hasn’t been publicly
disclosed.  Warburg, which bought Bausch & Lomb in a leveraged buyout
in 2007, would get a higher valuation for Bausch & Lomb in an
IPO than in a private sale, one of the people said. New York-
based Warburg has leaned toward taking the company public after
private bids came in at less than $9 billion, below the asking
price of at least $10 billion, people familiar with the
situation said earlier this month.  Underwriters for Bausch & Lomb’s IPO include Bank of
America Corp. and  Citigroup Inc. (C) , the people said.  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) , which Warburg had hired to explore the private sale,
will also work on the IPO, the people said. Goldman is still
trying to find a buyer though that is less likely now than an
offering, said one of these people.  Adam Grossberg, a spokesman for Bausch & Lomb, and Ed
Trissel, a spokesman for Warburg, declined to comment.
Representatives for JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank
of America declined to comment.  Warburg is disposing of Bausch & Lomb as it seeks
investments for a new fund that documents obtained by Bloomberg
News show has a target of $12 billion. Warburg took Bausch &
Lomb private in a deal valued at $4.6 billion, including debt,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Vision Care  A $10 billion sale would have given Warburg a more than 200
percent gain on its $1.7 billion equity investment in the 2007
buyout, people familiar with the matter said in January.  Bausch & Lomb has three businesses: pharmaceuticals, vision
care and surgical, according to documents provided by the
company in December. Pharmaceuticals and vision each account for
about 40 percent of sales, with the rest coming from surgical.  Since the buyout, Bausch & Lomb’s earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization have risen to just under
$700 million from about $400 million, people familiar with the
company’s financial situation have said. The company projected
2012 Ebitda of more than $700 million and double-digit revenue
growth, another person said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
