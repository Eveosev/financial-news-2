Copper fell to a two-month low and
aluminum slid to lowest level since November as China’s
manufacturing data trailed economists’ forecasts, a signal that
recovery in the largest user of metals may be losing steam.  Copper for three-month delivery dropped as much as 0.7
percent to $7,760 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, the
lowest since Dec. 20, and was at $7,780 at 3:17 p.m. Shanghai
time. Aluminum lost as much as 0.6 percent to $1,993.25 a ton,
the lowest since Nov. 28.  China’s manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index was 50.1
in February, the National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today. The reading
compares with the 50.5 median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 31 economists and 50.4 in January. A number above 50
indicates expansion. A separate manufacturing PMI from HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics stood at 50.4, compared with a
forecast of 50.6.  “There are still lots of doubts regarding how strong the
economy will be this year,” Peng Guoliang, an analyst at Dadi
Futures Co., said by phone from Hangzhou. “Copper supply and
demand in China is little changed compared with last year.”  Copper for May delivery on the Comex in New York dropped
0.4 percent to $3.5320 a pound, while the June contract on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange closed 1.7 percent lower at 56,730
 yuan  ($9,116) a ton.  On the LME, lead and nickel also declined, while zinc and
tin were little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
