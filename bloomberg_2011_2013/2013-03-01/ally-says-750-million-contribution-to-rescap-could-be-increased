Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) , the U.S.-owned
auto finance firm, is still willing to contribute $750 million
to ease the recovery of its Residential Capital unit from
bankruptcy and said the sum could be bigger.  “Given the inherent uncertainty of the bankruptcy process,
it is possible that the $750 million estimate could be increased
or decreased in the future, but we are unable to estimate the
amount of any potential modification,” Detroit-based Ally said
today in its annual regulatory  filing .  Ally made the offer when ResCap declared bankruptcy last
year to cover costs of soured subprime home loans and insulate
itself from legal claims. Chief Executive Officer  Michael Carpenter  said the payment was designed to “avoid the noise”
and allow Ally to proceed with its own turnaround plans.  The settlement plan lapsed on Feb. 28, leading Ally to say
in today’s filing that it may face substantial  legal claims  from
ResCap’s bankruptcy with possibly significant costs.  Ally benefited from more than $17 billion in U.S. bailouts
and plans to repay the funds by staging an initial public
offering. Carpenter has put the idea on hold until after
ResCap’s fate is clear. The U.S. owns 74 percent of Ally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
