     March 1 (Bloomberg) --  Metro AG (MEO) ,  Germany ’s biggest
retailer, cut its full-year dividend 26 percent and reported
earnings that missed analysts’ estimates as the company
struggled to contend with weakening economies in Europe.  Investors will receive 1 euro ($1.31) per ordinary share,
down from 1.35 euros in 2011, the Dusseldorf-based company said
today in a statement. That was less than the 1.33-euro average
estimate of 35 analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The retailer also
said earnings per share before special items fell 28 percent to
1.89 euros in 2012, missing the average  estimate  of 2.37 euros.  The shares  fell  as much as 5.3 percent in  Frankfurt , the
steepest drop in five months, and were 5 percent lower at 22.52
euros at 3:16 p.m. local time. The stock has declined more than
50 percent in the past two years, costing Metro its place in the
 benchmark DAX Index , as the owner of Media-Saturn electronics
outlets struggled to grow sales in southern and parts of eastern
 Europe . Chief Executive Officer Olaf Koch has implemented cost-
cutting measures and said last year savings would probably
exceed 120 million euros in 2012.  “The saving from the dividend cut is not particularly
large but it is clearly part of a wider policy of tightening
capital discipline,” James Collins, an analyst at Deutsche Bank
AG in  London , wrote in a report today. EPS missed expectations
because of a high effective tax rate as “the company has not
capitalized the deferred taxes on current losses.”  Full-year earnings before interest and tax was 1.98 billion
euros before one-time items, Metro said, almost meeting the
company’s forecast of 2 billion euros. The retailer cut the
prediction in October, having said before then that earnings
would be about the same as 2011’s 2.37 billion euros.  Haniel Stake  Koch is focusing on the Cash & Carry wholesale business and
the Media-Saturn electronics unit, while cutting investment in
Kaufhof department stores and Real grocery outlets. Metro agreed
in November to sell its Real stores in eastern Europe to French
retailer Groupe Auchan SA.  Metro’s  biggest investor , Franz Haniel & Cie GmbH, reduced
its stake to 30.01 percent from 34.24 percent last month,
generating proceeds of about 300 million euros.  Today’s statement was released ahead of the company’s full
earnings report due on March 20.  Metro also said it will reduce the 2012 dividend on its
preference shares to 1.06 euros from 1.49 euros.  “The dividend is below expectations but the yield is still
reasonable,”  Fabio Fazzari , an analyst at Equita SIM SpA, said
by phone. “Analysts are not expecting a stellar 2013. Investors
could be satisfied with a little sign of positive rebound or a
stabilization. Big negative surprises are unlikely this year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
