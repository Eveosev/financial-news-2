Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, lowered its estimate for potential
losses from legal claims by $100 million.  “Reasonably possible”  legal costs  are as much as $3.5
billion, the New York-based firm said today in a report on the
quarter that ended Dec. 31, without giving specific reasons for
the decline. That compares with $3.6 billion three months
earlier and $3.4 billion at the end of June.  Banks started making public estimates of possible losses
after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told finance
chiefs in October 2010 that they should disclose such costs
“when there is at least a reasonable possibility” they may be
incurred, even if the risk is too low to require reserves.  The estimate doesn’t include potential losses from legal
matters that are at an early stage or where the firm can’t
determine the potential amount, according to the filing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
