Wheat production in the European
Union, the world’s second-largest exporter, will increase in the
season beginning in July, the European Commission said.  The harvest may total 131.1 million metric tons in the
2013-14 season that starts July 1, up from 123.3 million tons a
year earlier, the bloc said today in an online  report . Forecasts
for the season include 28 countries, as  Croatia  will join the
bloc in July. Last year, drought reduced  crops  in some southern
and eastern countries. Precipitation since mid-January has
helped replenish soil moisture from  Spain  to  Romania , the EU’s
Monitoring Agricultural Resources  unit  said Feb. 25.  Wheat exports to countries outside the EU may total 16.5
million tons, compared with shipments of 14.9 million tons a
year earlier from the bloc’s current 27 countries. Croatia’s
wheat exports in the 2012-13 season were 350,000 tons, with
production at 800,000 tons, according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture .  Total grain production in the EU may be 291.1 million tons,
including 65.3 million tons of corn and 54.6 million tons of
barley, the EU said. That compares with total output of 272.3
million tons a year earlier. Rapeseed production in 2013-14 will
be 20.5 million tons, compared with 19.3 million tons a year
earlier, according to the  report .  The U.S. is the world’s biggest wheat exporter, according
to the USDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
