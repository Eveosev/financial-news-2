Fomento de Construcciones y
Contratas SA , the Spanish builder that lost half its market
value last year, said it will overhaul its business after having
a 1 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) loss in 2012.  FCC will focus on its main business of environmental
services, infrastructure works and water management as part of a
three-year strategic plan that seeks to reduce debt and return
to profit, said Juan Bejar, who became chief executive officer
in February.  “The cement business is undergoing its worst crisis in
history,” Bejar said on a conference call with analysts today.
The company will present details of a strategy through 2015 on
March 20.  FCC said it will cut investment in its energy, real estate,
and telecommunication businesses. The Madrid-based construction
company said yesterday it swung to a loss in 2012, while
analysts had expected a profit of 38.4 million euros, according
to the average of 10 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. FCC had
1.15 billion euros of restructuring expenses and costs from
exiting cement and construction markets.  FCC set a goal of cutting debt by as much as 2.6 billion
euros in the coming three years as it divests at least 2.2
billion euros of assets.  The stock fell as much as 3.9 percent in  Madrid  and was
trading 3.3 percent lower at 8.65 euros as of 11:02 a.m. local
time.  “The balance-sheet clean-up should be welcomed,” BPI
analysts said in an e-mailed report today. “However, the
underlying trends still show a deterioration of profitability in
the main areas” of business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
