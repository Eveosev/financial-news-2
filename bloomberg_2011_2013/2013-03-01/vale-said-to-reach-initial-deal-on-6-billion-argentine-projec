Vale SA (VALE3) , the mining company that
halted a $6 billion potash project in  Argentina  this year, will
sign a preliminary agreement with provincial authorities that
may lead to its resumption, a government official said.  Vale is expected to sign the  agreement with federal and
provincial authorities today to establish new terms that may
allow the project to proceed, said the official, who asked not
to be named because talks are private.  Company executives are meeting in Buenos Aires with Carlos
Molina, mining director for Mendoza’s province, where the potash
mine is located, to sign the accord, the person said.  The agreement to be signed is related to “legal and
working obligations for the project,” Vale’s press office in
Rio de Janiero said.  Work at the Rio Colorado fertilizer operation was suspended
indefinitely in January so Vale could reassess the project,
which has become more costly on inflation and exchange rate
fluctuations. Vale is also receiving demands from some of the
provinces affected by the project, Chief Executive Officer
Murilo Ferreira told analysts in a conference call yesterday.  The company is reviewing options and will discuss the
project at a board meeting March 11, he said. Vale  dropped  2.7
percent to 35.49 reais in Sao Paulo at 4:29 p.m.  To contact the reporters on this story:
