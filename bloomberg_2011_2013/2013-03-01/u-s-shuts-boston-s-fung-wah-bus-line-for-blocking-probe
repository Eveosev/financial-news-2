The U.S. Transportation Department
shut Fung Wah Bus Transportation Inc.,  Boston ’s biggest
Chinatown bus operator, saying company officials tried to block
a safety investigation.  The action followed a Feb. 26 order by the Federal Motor
Carrier Safety Administration idling the company’s 28 buses
after inspectors spotted cracked frames and badly welded
repairs.  “Bus companies that jeopardize public safety and refuse to
cooperate with our investigators have no place on the road,”
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement.  A telephone call to Fung Wah’s business office seeking
comment wasn’t answered.  Federal regulators have been increasing scrutiny of bus
safety at discount lines that, like Fung Wah, often operate
between Chinatown neighborhoods of large cities. Their growth
has been booming as passengers seek discount tickets, which may
sell for as little as $1.  The earlier order applied only to the company’s buses; Fung
Wah continued to sell tickets and was allowed to operate using
vehicles it rented or leased. Agency investigators had continued
their examination of the company’s operations and records before
the company stopped cooperating, FMCSA said in its statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
