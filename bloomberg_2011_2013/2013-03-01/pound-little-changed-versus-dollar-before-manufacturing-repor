The pound weakened through $1.50 for
the first time since since July 2010 after an industry report
showed U.K. manufacturing unexpectedly shrank in February.  Sterling dropped for the third time in four days versus the
euro as the  Bank of England  said mortgage approvals declined in
January, signaling the housing market is struggling to recover.
The pound has dropped the most of any major currency this year
as speculation the central bank will need to add more monetary
support to the faltering economy damped demand. U.K. government
bonds rose, with 10-year yields set for their biggest weekly
drop since November 2011.  “The data was supposed to be good and it came out negative
so that has taken the rug out from under sterling’s feet,” said
Jane Foley, a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Rabobank
International in  London . “There is an array of negative
fundamentals for the U.K., so it’s very difficult to see silver
linings. I think sterling will be weak all year.”  The pound dropped 1 percent to $1.5018 at 4:40 p.m. London
time after sliding to $1.4986, the lowest since July 13, 2010.
The U.K. currency depreciated 0.4 percent to 86.43 pence per
euro. It reached 88.15 pence on Feb. 25, the weakest level since
Oct. 28, 2011.  The pound has depreciated 5.5 percent this year, the worst
performer among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar gained 3.2
percent and the euro rose 1.3 percent.  Manufacturing Shrinks  A gauge of U.K. manufacturing based on a survey of
 purchasing managers  slid to 47.9 last month, according to Markit
Economics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply .
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast an increase to 51,
above the level of 50 that divides growth from contraction.  “The data was very disappointing and way below
expectations,” said Bernd Berg, a currency strategist at Credit
Suisse Group AG in Zurich. “They show that the economy is
contracting much more than expected, reinforcing the case for
further quantitative easing by the Bank of England.”  The central bank will keep its asset-purchase target
unchanged at 375 billion pounds when it announces its next
decision on March 7, according to 28 of 39 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg. Nine forecast an increase of 25 billion pounds,
with the remaining two predicting expansion of 50 billion pounds
and 75 billion pounds.  Mortgage approvals fell to 54,719 from 55,632 in December,
the Bank of England said. Net mortgage lending rose by 147
million pounds, the least since August.  Business Boost  WPP Plc (WPP) , the world’s largest advertising company, said the
weaker pound was boosting its business.  “We’ll have a bit of a following wind from currency,”
Chief Executive Officer  Martin Sorrell  said on Bloomberg
Television’s “Countdown” in an interview with  Mark Barton .
“We’ve already seen the dollar go from about $1.60 to $1.50 as
the pound weakened against the dollar the first few months of
this year, so things I think are sort of moving our way a little
bit as we go into 2013.”  WPP’s profit before interest and taxation rose 7.1 percent
to 1.53 billion pounds, the company said today.  The 10-year gilt  yield  fell 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 1.87 percent, the lowest since Dec. 31. The
1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 rose 0.865, or 8.65
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 98.94. The yield has
dropped 24 basis points this week, the most since the period
ended Nov. 4, 2011.  The  two-year  yield declined five basis points to 0.19
percent, heading for an eighth week of declines, the longest
since June 2011.  “Prospects for U.K. growth aren’t good,” said  Marc Ostwald , a rates strategist at Monument Securities Ltd. in
London. “Certainly the growth outlook justifies the level of
gilt yields.”  U.K. government bonds returned 0.9 percent in February,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
1.3 percent and Treasuries rose 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
