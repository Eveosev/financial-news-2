Akuo Energy SAS said it’s spending
$205 million to build two wind farms in  Uruguay  that will total
92 megawatts of capacity.  Construction has started and the power will be bought by
Uruguayan state utility Usinas y Terminales Electricas under 20-
year purchase agreements, Paris-based Akuo said today in an e-
mailed  statement . The company plans to complete both projects in
the fourth quarter.  The French developer is using its Uruguayan projects to
establish a footprint in Latin America. Akuo has 340 megawatts
of power plants in operation, and a further 2,800 megawatts
under development in 10 countries.  “Our goal since the beginning has been to focus on Uruguay
as our entry market into Latin America,” Akuo Energy President
Eric Scotto said in the statement. “Our strong foothold in
Uruguay will allow for future expansion into the region.”  The bigger of the two projects is the Florida wind farm
about 100 kilometers (65 miles) north of the Uruguayan capital,
Montevideo. It’ll have 21  Nordex SE (NDX1)  2.4-megawatt turbines,
according to Akuo. Akuo said it secured $88.5 million of project
financing for the plan, from groups including the European
Development Finance Institutions and Proparco.  The second project, called Generacion Eolica Minas, is east
of Montevideo and will have 14  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  3-
megawatt turbines, Akuo said. the company is in “advanced
negotiations” to secure $76 million of financing for that
project shortly, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
