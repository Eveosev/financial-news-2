India ’s rupee dropped to a six-week
low on concern slowing growth will hamper the government’s
ability to rein in the widest  budget deficit  among the largest
 emerging markets .  India plans to narrow the gap to 4.8 percent of gross
domestic product in the year through March 2014 from an
estimated 5.2 percent, Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram
said in his budget speech yesterday. The 2014 shortfall is
likely to be 5 percent due to “optimistic” revenue assumptions,
while spending hasn’t been reined in, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
said in research note dated Feb. 28. Economic growth last
quarter was slower than economists predicted, official data show.  “The budget may be negative for investor sentiment and for
the rupee, at least in the short term,”  Tushar Poddar , a
Mumbai-based economist at Goldman, wrote in the report. “The
consolidation may not be material enough to provide space for
the  Reserve Bank  of India to enact a significant amount of rate
cuts” and support growth, he wrote.  The rupee declined 0.5 percent to 54.63 per dollar as of
9:58 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 54.74 earlier, the weakest level since Jan. 17. The
currency, which fell 0.8 percent this week and lost 2.1 percent
in February, will reach 55 in three months, according to Goldman.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 9.50 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The rate fell five basis points this week.  Current-Account Concern  The shortfall in India’s current account, the broadest
measure of trade, is expected to be “significantly higher” in
the year through March 2013 than the previous period’s record
4.2 percent of GDP, RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said Feb. 11.  This gap is a “greater worry” than the fiscal deficit,
Chidambaram said yesterday. “This year, and perhaps next year
too, we have to find over $75 billion to finance the current-
account deficit,” he said.  India’s GDP rose 4.5 percent last quarter, the slowest pace
since 2009, a government report showed yesterday. That was less
than the 4.9 percent growth predicted in a Bloomberg survey.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.69 per
dollar, compared with 55.45 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.64 versus 55.44. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
