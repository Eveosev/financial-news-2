Peruvian consumer prices
unexpectedly fell last month as declining food prices offset
increases in all other segments, the government reported.  Consumer prices  dropped 0.09 percent from January, the
first decrease in three months, the government’s statistics
agency said in an e-mailed statement today. The median forecast
of 12 analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for a 0.18 percent
increase. The annual inflation rate slowed to 2.45 percent from
2.87 percent in January, the agency said.  Food and drink prices dropped 0.7 percent last month while
electricity costs rose 2.3 percent. Gasoline rose 3 percent and
private schooling fees climbed 2.5 percent, the agency said.  Peru’s central bank may consider cutting borrowing costs if
inflationary conditions allow, its research director Adrian Armas said Feb. 8 after policy makers kept their  benchmark
lending rate  at 4.25 percent. Policy makers have held  Peru ’s
rate, the lowest in Latin America after Colombia, for 21
consecutive months. The central bank projects inflation of 2
percent this year, the mid-point of its target range.  Peru’s economy expanded at the slowest pace in a year
during the fourth quarter, rising 5.9 percent from the same
period of 2011, as construction activity slowed and fishing
contracted, the agency said Feb. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
