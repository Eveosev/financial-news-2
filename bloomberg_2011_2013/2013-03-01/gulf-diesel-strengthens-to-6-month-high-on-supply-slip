U.S.  Gulf Coast  diesel fuel
strengthened against futures as  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  began
planned maintenance at its 340,000-barrel-a-day Deer Park,
 Texas , refinery following a drop in area supplies.  Shell (RDS/A) ’s Deer Park plant is expected to conduct three to
four weeks of work on a crude unit, a coker and a sulfur
recovery unit, a person familiar with the schedule said Feb. 15.
That may further decrease regional  inventories , which fell
21,000 barrels to 40.3 million in the week ended Feb. 22, the
Energy Information Administration reported.  Kimberly Windon, a Houston-based company spokesman,
confirmed scheduled work began today. She didn’t discuss the
units involved or the duration of the maintenance.  The premium for  ultra-low-sulfur diesel  on the Gulf Coast
strengthened 1.25 cents to 9 cents a gallon against heating oil
futures on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 2:12 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yesterday was the last
day of trading for March heating oil contracts.  Gulf Coast diesel traded 2.13 cents a barrel below the same
fuel in New York Harbor. The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf, a
measure of refining profitability for gasoline and distillates
based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , increased
1.53 cents to $32.30 a barrel. The same spread for Light
Louisiana Sweet rose 1.18 cents to 11.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
