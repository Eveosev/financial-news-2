Foreign espionage of top technology
companies is an escalating threat to  Finland ’s economy,
according to the Nordic nation’s counter-intelligence agency.  “High-level technological research and its applications
already in production are constant targets for intelligence
gathering,” the Finnish Security Intelligence Service in
Helsinki said in its annual report today. “The resulting
damages may be severe and have a significant impact on the
competitiveness of our national economy.”  Cyber espionage against companies gained renewed attention
last week when network security firm Mandiant Corp.  reported 
that the Chinese army may be behind a hacking group that has
attacked at least 141 companies worldwide since 2006. China’s
Foreign Ministry said Feb. 19 the country opposes computer
hacking and that it is a victim of attacks. The U.S. is the
biggest attacker of  China ’s Internet, said Hong Lei, a spokesman
for the ministry.  Illegal information gathering was observed at about 12
percent of Finnish companies, and 16 percent suspected it had
happened in 2009 to 2011, according to a survey by the Helsinki-
based agency. Energy and chemical industries were targets of
“particular interest” last year, it said.  The Finnish government approved a national cybersecurity
strategy on Jan. 24 to help the military and companies operating
critical infrastructure counter threats.  To contact the reporter on this story:
