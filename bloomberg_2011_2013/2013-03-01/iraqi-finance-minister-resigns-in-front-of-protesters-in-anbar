Iraqi Finance Minister Rafih al- Issawi, one of the most senior Sunni Muslims in the Shiite
Muslim-led government, announced his resignation at an anti-
government rally, heightening political tensions.  “I am with you, I am your son,” Issawi said in a speech
in Ramadi, west of  Baghdad , aired live on local television
today. “I will not return to this government,” Issawi told
demonstrators. “We are with you,” they chanted in response.  Demonstrations have spread to eight regions in  Iraq  to
demand that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki share more power.
Protests began in part because of the arrest of Issawi’s
security guards on terrorism charges in December.  State television quoted Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki’s
office as saying the resignation would not be accepted until an
investigation was complete.  Issawi, who survived an assassination attempt Jan. 13, has
said that Maliki was responsible for the arrest of his security
team by what he called a “militia.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
