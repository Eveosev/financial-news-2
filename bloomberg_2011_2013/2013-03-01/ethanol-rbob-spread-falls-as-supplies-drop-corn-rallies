Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened as imports of the biofuel rose to a seasonal high.  The spread to reformulated gasoline, or RBOB, futures grew
1.19 cents to 71.46 cents a gallon as the market began trading
the April contract. The differential was at the lowest level in
more than a month two days earlier.  U.S. imports of ethanol climbed 11,000 barrels to 32,000
barrels in the week ended Feb. 22, the highest level for this
time of year since data started being collected in 2010, Energy
Information Administration data showed. Corn rallied for a fifth
day, while gasoline advanced after the largest monthly slide
since October.  “An increase in imports is certainly bearish for the
market,”  Jason Ward , an analyst at Northstar Commodity
Investment Inc., said in a phone interview from  Minneapolis .  Denatured ethanol for April delivery gained 0.5 cent to
settle at $2.414 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. The
March contract, which expires March 5, rose 0.1 cent to $2.406.  Gasoline for April delivery gained 1.69 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $3.1286 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The front-month gasoline contract declined 3.7 percent
in February, the biggest monthly drop since October.  Corn for May delivery rose 5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$7.085 a bushel, a three-week high for the contract.  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning a bushel of corn into ethanol, was minus 23 cents a
gallon based on March contracts for ethanol and corn, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The amount doesn’t include
revenue from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct
of ethanol production, which can be fed to livestock.  RINs Advance  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs,  for
corn-based ethanol  reached a record 56 cents yesterday. RINs are
credits that help the Environmental Protection Agency track
compliance with federal biofuel-use mandates, which call for
U.S. refiners to use 13.8 billion gallons of ethanol, or 900,000
barrels a day, this year and 14.4 billion next year.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 88 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool last week, down from 90 percent the previous
week-earlier period, the EIA reported. Production gained 15,000
barrels to 812,000 barrels in that same time period, a fourth
consecutive weekly gain, the data showed.  The biofuel rose the most in cash market trading on the
U.S. West Coast, where spot prices advanced 2 cents to $2.62 a
gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. Ethanol fell 2.5
cents to $2.445 a gallon on the  Gulf Coast , 2 cents to $2.395 in
Chicago and 1 cent to $2.515 in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
