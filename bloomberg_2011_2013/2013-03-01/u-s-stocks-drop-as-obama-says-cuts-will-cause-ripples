U.S. stocks declined as President
Barack Obama said federal spending cuts will cause “ripple
effects” throughout the economy and jobs will be lost.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2 percent to
1,511.18, after advancing as much as 0.3 percent earlier.  Obama met with congressional leaders as no one predicted a
breakthrough to avert $85 billion in federal spending cuts set
to start before midnight. Stocks erased gains earlier in the day
amid better-than-estimated data on consumer confidence and
manufacturing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
