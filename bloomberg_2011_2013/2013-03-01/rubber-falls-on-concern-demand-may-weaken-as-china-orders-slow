Rubber extended a decline after
falling in February, on concern that demand for the commodity
may weaken after manufacturing growth slowed in  China  and
Japan’s consumer prices dropped.  The contract for delivery in August lost as much as 2.3
percent to 286.3 yen a kilogram ($3,089 a metric ton) before
trading at 286.6 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange at 11:49
a.m. Futures lost 7.2 percent last month, the worst performance
since June.  A Chinese manufacturing index fell for a second month as a
gauge of new orders declined, a signal the nation’s economic
recovery may be losing steam. Japan’s consumer prices excluding
fresh food fell 0.2 percent in January from a year earlier, the
third-straight decline, the statistics bureau said.  “Japan’s macro economic data are lower than market
expectations, and Chinese statistics aren’t good today,” said
Naohiro Niimura, a partner at research company Market Risk
Advisory in Tokyo.  China’s manufacturing  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was 50.1
in February, the National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today in Beijing.
That compares with the 50.5 median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 31 analysts and 50.4 in January. A reading above 50
indicates expansion.  Thailand ,  Indonesia  and  Malaysia  may extend export cuts if
prices drop below $3 per kilogram when the program ends in
March, Darmansyah Basyaruddin, chief executive officer at the
International Rubber Consortium, told reporters at seminar in
Jakarta on Feb. 27.  Thailand, the largest producer, agreed with Indonesia and
Malaysia last year to cut exports by a combined 300,000 tons in
the six months through March. The action came after prices
slumped to an almost three-year low of 205.6 yen in August.  The contract for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 2.4 percent to 24,120  yuan  ($3,875) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board gained 0.6 percent to 89.2 baht ($3.00) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
