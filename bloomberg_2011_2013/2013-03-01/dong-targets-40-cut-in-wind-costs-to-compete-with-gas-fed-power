Dong Energy A/S, the world’s biggest
offshore-wind developer, plans to cut the cost of generation by
almost 40 percent to compete with gas-fired  power plants .  Dong may reduce costs at new U.K. projects to less than 100
euros ($130) a megawatt-hour by 2020 from 160 euros, it said in
a statement. That compares with estimates for a 22 percent drop
from London-based researcher Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Nations including Britain, the world’s largest market for
marine wind farms, are seeking to cut the cost of the technology
that’s as much as double the expense of coal-fired generation.
The U.K. government, aiming to curb subsidies for offshore wind,
has a cost target of 100 pounds ($150) a megawatt-hour by 2020.  “Both these levelized cost-of-energy targets are very
optimistic,” said Sophia Von Waldow, a BNEF analyst. Offshore
wind-power costs will probably increase in the short term as
projects move farther from shore, before falling by 2020, she
said by e-mail. BNEF estimates industry costs at 128 euros a
megawatt-hour by 2020 compared with 164.50 euros last year.  A reduction of about 35 percent to 40 percent is
“achievable, although difficult,” Dong Chief Executive Officer
Henrik Poulsen said Feb. 27.  The Danish company, which has built 38 percent of  Europe ’s
offshore wind, plans to expand marine capacity to 6.5 gigawatts
of turbines by 2020 from 1.7 gigawatts. The Fredericia-based
utility has favored sea-based wind over gas-fired plants to curb
exposure to energy-market volatility and reduce emissions.  “As the U.K. moves towards a more sustainable and
renewable electricity mix, the costs of the new technologies
must come into line with existing power generation to minimize
the impact on consumer bills,” Benj Sykes, U.K. manager for
Dong Energy Wind Power, said in today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
