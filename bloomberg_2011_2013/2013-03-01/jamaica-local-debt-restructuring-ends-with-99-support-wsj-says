Jamaica’s restructuring of local
bonds ended with about 99 percent of debt holders participating,
the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an interview with the
head of the country’s debt management unit.  The level of participation in the restructuring is enough
to meet International Monetary Fund requirements for a $750
million loan, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
