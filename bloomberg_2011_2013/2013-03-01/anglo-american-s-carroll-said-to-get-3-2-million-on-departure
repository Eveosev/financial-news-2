Anglo American Plc (AAL)  Chief Executive
Officer  Cynthia Carroll  will receive about 2.1 million pounds
($3.2 million) as she leaves the mining company next month,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  Carroll will get 700,000 pounds of her 2012 bonus this
month and about 1.4 million pounds in vested shares when she
leaves at the end of April, the person said, asking not to be
identified because the agreement is private.  Princeton, New Jersey-born Carroll will also receive
monthly payments from her 1.2 million pound-annual salary until
she finds a job, up to the end of 2013 at the latest, the person
said. The payouts could reach as much as 7 million pounds in
total if all of a set of conditions related to the company’s
earnings performance over the next two years are met, the person
said.  The 56-year-old, who is being replaced by  AngloGold Ashanti
Ltd. (ANG)  CEO Mark Cutifani, was the first woman, external hire and
non-South African to lead London-based Anglo. Carroll announced
her departure in October, after the company had lost almost a
quarter of its value during her five-year tenure and suffered
cost blowouts and delays at its $8.8 billion Minas-Rio iron-ore
project in  Brazil .  Sky News  earlier reported the terms of Carroll’s exit
package. A spokesman for Anglo declined to comment.  Tom Albanese, who stood down as Rio Tinto Group CEO in
January, left without a bonus or cash lump sum after the company
said it will take about $14 billion of writedowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
