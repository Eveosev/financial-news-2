The O2 is about to be taken over by
Girls Aloud for three nights of pop hits.  The band is running through its greatest-hits album “Ten,”
which features singles such as “Sound of the Underground” and
“I’ll Stand by You.” Cheryl Cole’s solo success has not stopped
the act, formed though a TV talent show in 2002 and still making
records such as “Something New.”  March 1-3 at O2, Peninsula Square, SE10 0DX. Information:

ashram in Ahmadabad,  India  and made art from a mixture of mud
(used for building huts), spices and paper pulp. Two of his
fragrant “Unions” are now in an exhibition.  The main focus of the “Jammers” exhibition are the
pristine stitched fabrics -- like stretched-out saris -- that
Rauschenberg made in  Florida  in the ’70s. They’re unlike his
earlier art, which was made with trash picked off New York
streets; for samples of that, visit the Barbican’s “The Bride
and the Bachelors” exhibition.  “Jammers” ends March 28 at the Gagosian Gallery,
Britannia Street, WC1X 9JD. For information:
 http://www.gagosian.com  or +44-20-7841-9961.  Gagosian is within walking distance of Caravan, an all-day
cafe owned by New Zealanders. The coffee is first class, the
food is good and there’s Prosecco on tap. The venue is housed in
a warehouse dating back to 1851 in the new Granary Square
development. Information:  http://www.caravankingscross.co.uk/  or
+44-20-7101-7661.  Saturday Night  It’s your last chance to see the Old Vic’s punchy revival
of “Kiss Me Kate” -- the story of a divorced actor couple who
reappear together on stage. Glamorous Lilli Vanessi (Hannah Waddingham) hopes to win back her ex (Alex Bourne). He’s busy
romancing another blonde and avoiding a pair of dopey gangsters.  The Trevor Nunn staging, Cole Porter music and fine dancing
make “Kiss Me Kate” a fun night out. The Old Vic, The Cut, SE1
8NB:  http://www.oldvictheatre.com , +44-844-871-7628, to March 2.  The Anchor & Hope, along The Cut from the Old Vic, is a
destination for  London  food lovers. It has won numerous awards,
including Gastro Pub of the Year and London Dining Pub of the
Year. It doesn’t accept reservations (except for Sunday lunch)
so it’s wise to arrive before 6 p.m. if you want to eat before
the show. Information:  http://bit.ly/gnpy6v  or +44-20-7928-9898.  Sunday  “Cabaret” comes to the South Bank.  The Oscar-winning 1972 musical will be screened free of
charge in the foyer of the Royal Festival Hall on Sunday night.
And that’s not all: Liza Minnelli herself will shimmy on the
main stage Friday as she revisits such favorites as “Money
Makes the World Go Round” and “Mein Herr.”  It’s all part of the Southbank Centre’s yearlong festival
of 20th-century music (“The Rest is Noise”), currently focused
on prewar Berlin, with talks and concerts and a London
Philharmonic Orchestra performance of “The Threepenny Opera.”  Information:  http://southbankcentre.co.uk/therestisnoise  or
