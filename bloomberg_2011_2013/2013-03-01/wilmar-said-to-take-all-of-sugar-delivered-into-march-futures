Wilmar International Ltd. (WIL)  was the
only buyer of the raw sugar delivered against the expired March
futures contract on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , according to
two people familiar with the transaction.  The Singapore-based company took 3,007 contracts, or about
152,763 metric tons, of raw sugar, said the people, who declined
to be identified because they are not allowed to speak to the
media. The delivery was the smallest for a March contract since
2006, according to Kingsman SA, a Lausanne, Switzerland-based
sugar research company owned by The McGraw-Hill Cos. Iris Chan,
a spokeswoman at Wilmar, didn’t return a call and e-mail today.  Wilmar entered the sugar business in 2010 through the
acquisition of Sucrogen Ltd. in  Australia , according to the
company’s  website . Sucrogen owns eight mills in Australia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
