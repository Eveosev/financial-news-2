Gasoline swung between gains and
losses after reports showed U.S. manufacturing expanded in
February and  consumer confidence  rose, indicating demand for
motor fuel may improve.  Futures fluctuated after the Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan final  index  of consumer sentiment advanced to 77.6 from
73.8 in January. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory
 index  rose to 54.2, from 53.1 in January, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group said today.  “We bounced on the better-than-expected consumer
confidence and manufacturing, and now the market is trying to
stabilize on the back of some of the economic data,” said  Gene
McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut.  April-delivery gasoline rose 0.16 cent to $3.1133 a gallon
at 1:09 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Volume was 18
percent above the 100-day average for the time of day. Prices
dipped to $3.059 before the reports and then rose as high as
$3.1261.  Heating oil for April delivery fell 2.98 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.9305 a gallon. Trading volume was 5.5 percent
above the 100-day average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
