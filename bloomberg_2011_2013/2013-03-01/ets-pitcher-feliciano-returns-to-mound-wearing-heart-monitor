New York  Mets pitcher Pedro Feliciano has been cleared to return to baseball as long as he
wears a heart monitor on the field, the team said.  Feliciano, 36, was diagnosed with left ventricular
noncompaction, a rare genetic condition, according to a
statement by his agent Melvin Roman.  “If his condition was serious, where the experts had
determined for him not to play baseball anymore, I am sure he
would not return to the mound,” Roman said.  Feliciano, who missed the first week of the Grapefruit
League when his physical revealed a heart anomaly, will be
worked back into the pitching schedule as he seeks to secure a
spot on the Major League Baseball team’s roster.  A member of the Mets from 2002-04 and 2006-10, Feliciano
set the franchise record for appearances with 92 in 2010. After
signing a two-year deal with the  New York Yankees , he had left
shoulder surgery in 2011.  Feliciano signed a minor league deal with the Mets this
winter worth $1 million if he makes the big league club,
according to the team’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
