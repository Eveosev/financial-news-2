Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s Vikram Malhotra,
global head of its wealth management unit serving the South
Asian community, comments on investment preferences of wealthy
Indians living abroad. Non-resident Indians are his unit’s
largest customer group, he said in an interview in Singapore
yesterday.  On asset class preferences:  “Fixed income, forex, real estate and structured products
tend to be favored. Fixed income is a key part of their home
bias because they understand Indian institution-issued paper.
Indonesians do a fair bit of forex. Chinese clients tend to
favor real estate and equities. No two clients are alike, but
these are the general flavors.”  On business growth:  “We have the largest team globally, with over 30 bankers,
serving the South Asian segment. We estimate the potential of
this market to be $500 billion. I don’t fret over the $500
billion number. Assets under management have doubled every year
since 2010 for the segment. And our plan for the next couple of
years is to grow by 40 percent annually.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
