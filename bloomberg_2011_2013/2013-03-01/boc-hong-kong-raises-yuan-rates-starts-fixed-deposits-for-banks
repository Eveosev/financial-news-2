BOC Hong Kong Holdings Ltd. (2388) , the
city’s sole  yuan  clearing bank, raised the  interest rate  on
other lenders’ accounts in the Chinese currency.  The overnight rate was increased to 0.648 percent from
0.629 percent from today, Aries Law, a spokeswoman at BOC Hong
Kong said by telephone. The lender has also started offering
yuan fixed deposits maturing in one to three months to financial
institutions that do business in the Chinese currency, she said.  “These will improve the services of the clearing bank,”
said Law. “That’ll also open more channels for participating
banks to allocate their yuan assets as well as raising Hong
Kong’s status as an offshore yuan trading hub.”  The rate on one-month fixed deposits for banks was set at
2.2 percent today, according to BOC Hong Kong data. That on two-
and three-month savings were 2.3 percent and 2.4 percent,
respectively.  The clearing bank cut the rate on yuan savings to 0.629
percent from 0.865 percent in April 2011.  Yuan deposits  in the
city climbed 21 billion yuan ($3.4 billion) in January from the
previous month to 624 billion yuan, within 0.5 percent of the
record 627.3 billion in November 2011, according to the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority data yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
