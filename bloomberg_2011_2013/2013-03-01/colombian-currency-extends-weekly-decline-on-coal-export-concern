Colombia’s peso posted its biggest
weekly drop since October amid concern that an interruption of
coal exports will reduce the flow of dollars into the country.  The peso depreciated 0.8 percent 1,812.75 per U.S. dollar
this week, pushing its decline in 2013 to 2.5 percent. The
currency ended today’s session little changed.  “Coal is Colombia’s second-biggest export so what’s going
on has a big impact not only in terms of exports but on economic
growth,” Daniel Escobar, the head analyst at Global Securities
brokerage, said in a phone interview from Bogota. A report
showing a manufacturing slowdown in  China  reduced demand for
higher-yielding assets, hurting the peso, he said.  Workers declared a strike Feb. 7 at Cerrejon, Colombia’s
biggest coal mine, in a dispute over wages an benefits. A day
earlier, authorities suspended the port operating license of
Drummond Co., the country’s second-biggest thermal coal
producer, after it dumped a mix of water and coal into the sea.
Colombia lifted the three-week ban today.  The peso probably won’t weaken much further beyond 1,820,
Barclays Plc economist Sebastian Brown wrote in a report today.
The currency will “appreciate mildly” over the next three
months, he wrote.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 4.99 percent, according to the central
bank. The yields declined to 4.97 percent on Feb. 22, the lowest
since the securities were issued in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
