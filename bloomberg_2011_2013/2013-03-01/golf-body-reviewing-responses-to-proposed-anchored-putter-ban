Golf’s rule-makers said today they
are reviewing responses to the proposed ban on anchored putting
strokes and called it a “polarizing issue.”  The  Royal & Ancient Golf Club  and the  U.S. Golf Association 
said on Nov. 28 that they wanted to outlaw a stroke in which the
player’s putter rests against the body to create a pendulum-like
swing. A 90-day period in which parties could submit comments to
the two golf governing bodies on the issue ended yesterday.  “Anchoring has been a polarizing issue in our sport and
despite having weighed the matter thoroughly before making the
proposal, we believed it was important to give stakeholders in
the game the opportunity to air their views,” a  statement  from
the St. Andrews, Scotland-based R&A read. “Our consultation
period has generated a number of considered responses which have
continued to arrive right up to the deadline. We appreciate
those responses and will take time to review and evaluate
them.”  The USGA called the comment period “very constructive” in
a separate  statement .  “The discussion has been informative and serves as a
strong reminder of just how passionate golfers are about the
game -- no matter their position on this specific issue,” the
Far Hill, New Jersey-based body said. “As we have throughout
this process, we will continue to confer with the R&A in our
work to reach a final resolution in this matter.”  Woods’s Opposition  Many of golf’s top players, including 14-time major
tournament winner Tiger Woods, are among those opposed to the
use of anchored putters.  “I still feel that all 14 clubs should be swung,” Woods
told reporters on Feb. 27 in Palm Beach Gardens,  Florida , where
his is playing in the Honda Classic. “That hasn’t changed at
all.”  The U.S. PGA Tour said on Feb. 24 that it opposed the
planned ban, yielding the possibility that events on the sport’s
richest circuit may eventually have different rules concerning
putting. PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem said his group’s
Player Advisory Council researched the issue and informed the
USGA and R&A that a ban wouldn’t be in the best interest of golf
or the Tour.  “We note that this matter has proved particularly
sensitive in the United States, while the proposed rule change
has been received more favorably across the international
golfing community,” the R&A’s statement read. “As we have
throughout this process, we will work closely with the USGA in
moving toward a final resolution.”  McIlroy Call  Northern Ireland’s Rory McIlroy, who used a traditional
putting stroke to win the PGA Championship in August and the
2011 U.S. Open, said the issue isn’t good for the game.  “I think we all need to be on one side or the other,”
McIlroy, the No. 1 player in the Official World Golf Ranking,
told reporters on Feb. 27. “It’s just a bit of a mess.”  Players using an anchored putting stroke have won three of
golf’s last five major tournaments. While the clubs -- including
long-handled and so-called belly putters -- wouldn’t be banned,
their intended method of use would be under the rule proposed to
take effect in 2016.  The USGA sets the rules for the U.S. and  Mexico , while the
R&A covers the rest of the golf world.  To contact the reporter on this story:
