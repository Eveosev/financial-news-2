Silver may extend this year’s 7.6
percent drop as it nears a  bear market , according to  technical
analysis  by Commerzbank AG.  The metal slid to $27.975 an ounce in  London  today, the
lowest since Aug. 20. A close at $28.007 would be a 20 percent
drop from Oct. 4, the common definition of a bear market. A
slide below $28.26 in the next few days would mean the June 2012
trough of about $26.11 would “be back in play,” Commerzbank
said in a Feb. 26 report.  “While silver stays below its January high at about
$32.51, we will retain a bearish stance,”  Axel Rudolph , an
analyst at Commerzbank in London, wrote in the report.  Silver for immediate delivery traded at $28.04 by 11:14
a.m. in London and has underpeformed platinum, palladium and
gold this year. It slid 9.3 percent last month, the most since
May. Still, its 14-day relative strength index is at 28.8, below
the level of 30 that indicates to some analysts who study
technical charts that a rebound may be imminent.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter for this story:
