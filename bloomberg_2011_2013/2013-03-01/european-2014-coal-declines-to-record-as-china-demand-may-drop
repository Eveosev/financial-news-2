European coal for 2014 fell to a
record as Deutsche Bank AG said  China ’s anti-pollution efforts
may turn the country into a net exporter of the fuel in 2015.  Thermal coal for delivery in 2014 to Amsterdam, Rotterdam
or Antwerp fell $1.05, or 1.1 percent, to $97.10 a metric ton at
5:40 p.m. in  London , according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the lowest since at least January 2010, when
Bloomberg started to track the contract.  China’s push to improve  air quality  may mean it reduces
coal consumption for power, changes transport policies and
boosts clean energy investment, Michael Hsueh, a Deutsche Bank
analyst in London, said in an e-mailed note. That may cut coal
imports to 52 million metric tons in 2014 from 174 million tons
last year. China may export a net 43 million tons in 2015.  Bloomberg tracks broker data from ICAP Plc, GFI Group Inc.,
