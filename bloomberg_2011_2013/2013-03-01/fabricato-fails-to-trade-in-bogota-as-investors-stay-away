Trading in Colombian textile maker
Fabricato SA was halted within hours after it opened for the
first time in three months as investors refused to buy the
shares in a price range set by the country’s stock exchange.  Trading in the stock, which last changed hands Nov. 16 at
72 pesos, was halted at 12:35 p.m. after no buyers emerged, the
exchange said in a  statement  on its website. The exchange
planned to suspend trading for 15 minutes and then conduct an
auction with a floor price of 60.5 pesos.  As of 4:05 p.m. in Bogota, no trades had been recorded,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. An exchange spokesman
said he couldn’t comment on the auction or the trading.  Fabricato plunged 21 percent on Nov. 16, leading to a
suspension of the shares and prompting regulators to ban a
resumption until the Medellin-based company commissioned a
valuation report by an independent firm. That report, published
Feb. 19, valued the shares at 35 to 55 pesos.  The textile maker was the target last year of a failed
control bid by an investor group backed by the financial firm
Interbolsa SA. Bogota-based Interbolsa is being liquidated by
the Colombian government after its brokerage firm, formerly the
country’s biggest, collapsed last year, according to Colombian
officials.  An auction this morning also failed to produce any trades,
the exchange said in today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
