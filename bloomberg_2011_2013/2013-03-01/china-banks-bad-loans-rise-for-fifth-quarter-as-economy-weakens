Chinese banks’  bad loans  increased
for a fifth straight quarter, the longest deterioration streak
since the data became available in 2004, after the  economy  
slowed.  Loans overdue for at least three months rose by 14.1
billion  yuan  ($2.3 billion) in the three months ended Dec. 31,
to 492.9 billion yuan, the China Banking Regulatory Commission
said in a  statement  on its website today. Bad loans rose most at
mid-sized lenders and rural banks, the regulator said.  China’s banking system is grappling with rising defaults
and shrinking loan profitability after the world’s second-
largest economy expanded at the slowest pace in 13 years. Net
interest margin at the nation’s 3,800 lenders contracted to 2.75
percent in the fourth quarter from 2.77 percent in the third,
the regulator said.  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index fell for a second month in
February as a gauge of new orders declined, a signal the
nation’s economic recovery may be losing steam, the National
Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing said today.  Non-performing loans accounted for 0.95 percent of banks’
total advances as of December, unchanged from a quarter earlier,
according to the CBRC’s statement. Banks’ capital adequacy ratio
strengthened to 13.25 percent as of Dec. 31, from 13.03 percent
in September and combined net income at the nation’s banks grew
18.9 percent last year to 1.2 trillion yuan.  Bad loans in Wenzhou, the eastern Chinese city hit hardest
by the collapse of private lending last year, have soared to
23.86 billion yuan, from 8.6 billion yuan in 2011, the China
News Service reported yesterday. The city is assigning about 100
judges to help resolve soured debts at its lenders, the report
said.  Shares of  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd., the
world’s largest bank by market value, fell 0.4 percent to
HK$5.55 as of 11:06 a.m. in  Hong Kong .  China Construction Bank
Corp. (939) , the third-largest, fell 0.3 percent to HK$6.38 in the
city.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
