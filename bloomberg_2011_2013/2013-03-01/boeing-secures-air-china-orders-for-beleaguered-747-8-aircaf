Air China Ltd. (753) , the nation’s biggest
carrier by market value, agreed to buy two  Boeing Co. (BA)  747-8
aircraft in the planemaker’s first sale of the models this year.  Air China also will purchase one wide-body 777-300 plane,
20 single-aisle 737-800 jets and eight 777 freighters, according
to a statement yesterday. The planes have a combined catalog
value of $4.8 billion and Boeing granted “significant price
concessions” through credit agreements, the airline said in the
statement.  Boeing, based in  Chicago , hasn’t  sold  more than five 747-8
aircraft a year since Deutsche Lufthansa AG purchased 19 of the
planes in 2006, and concern that persistently weak demand could
prompt the company to curtail production has been mounting.
Yesterday’s orders may help alleviate some of the pressure,
according to Stephen Levenson of Stifel Financial Corp.  “There has been concern that the dearth of orders could
mean whitetails on the tarmac or insufficient demand to keep
build rates at the current two per month,” the New York-based
analyst wrote in a note to clients yesterday. Boeing “has been
making a major effort to book more 747-8 orders particularly
from carriers in the Asia-Pacific territory that may be best-
suited to their use.”  That helps to balance the production schedule and backlog,
said Levenson, who recommends buying the shares.  Catalog Value  The 747-8, 777-300 and 737 aircraft ordered yesterday have
a catalog value of about $2.6 billion, while the 777 freighters
command about $2.2 billion. The agreement also includes the
right to sell seven older 747 freight models back to Boeing and
the option to convert four of the new 737 orders to one
additional 777-300 jetliner, Beijing-based Air  China  said.  Air China rose 3.5 percent to HK$6.50 at the close in  Hong
Kong  yesterday. Boeing gained 0.5 percent to $77.28 in New York.  Separately, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. said yesterday it
canceled an order for eight Boeing 777-200 freighters and
instead has agreed to buy three 747-8 freighters. It also has
options to purchase five 777-200 freighters and will sell four
747-400 converted freighters to Boeing as part of its fleet
restructuring, the carrier said in a filing to Hong Kong’s stock
exchange.  Boeing expects to increase its deliveries to China by 60
percent this year, the head of its operations in the country was
quoted as saying in today’s China Daily. More than 120 aircraft
will be delivered to the country’s airlines this year, with
single-aisle planes such as the 737 the most popular type, Marc Allen, president of Boeing China, was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
