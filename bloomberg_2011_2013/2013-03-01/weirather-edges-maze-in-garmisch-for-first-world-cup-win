Liechtenstein’s  Tina Weirather 
claimed her first World Cup ski title by beating pre-race
favorite Tina Maze in today’s Super-G race in Germany.  Weirather finished in a time of one minute, 19.82 seconds
on the Kandahar 2 course in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Julia Mancuso of the U.S., last year’s winner, and overall World Cup
champion Maze of Slovenia tied for second, 0.12 seconds behind.  The 23-year-old Weirather had never won a race on the World
Cup circuit in 73 starts. Earlier this season, she finished
third in the giant slalom in Soelden, Austria and in the
downhill in Lake Louise, Canada. Weirather’s parents, Harti
Weirather and Hanni Wenzel, won 39 World Cup events between
them.  Maze last week clinched the women’s overall World Cup title
by winning the super-combined event in Meribel, France. Today’s
race didn’t change the standings in the Super-G, with Maze
leading with 370 points ahead of Mancuso’s 305 points.  The women continue tomorrow in Garmisch with a downhill
race, followed by another Super-G on March 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
