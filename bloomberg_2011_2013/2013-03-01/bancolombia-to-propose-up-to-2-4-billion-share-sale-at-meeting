Bancolombia SA (BCOLO) ,  Colombia ’s largest
bank, will propose a preferred stock sale of up to $2.4 billion
at its March 4 shareholders meeting.  The board of directors seeks shareholder approval to sell
up to 148.2 million of preferred shares, to be issued in one or
several tranches, according to the proposal on the bank’s
website. The board may decide to sell the shares in the local
market or abroad, according to the  statement , which wasn’t
dated.  The share sale would represent about 4.3 trillion pesos at
the preferred shares’ closing price today of 29,000 pesos, down
2.7 percent from yesterday.  Bancolombia agreed to pay $2.1 billion for HSBC Holdings
Plc’s Panama unit in its biggest-ever acquisition, it said on
Feb. 19. Chief Executive Officer Carlos Yepes said in a Feb. 26
radio interview that the bank was considering a share sale to
meet new global banking regulations and for its future expansion
plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
