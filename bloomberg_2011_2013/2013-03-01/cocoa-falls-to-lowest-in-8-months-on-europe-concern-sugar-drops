Cocoa futures dropped to a nine-
month low on mounting concern that a recession is weakening
demand in  Europe , the world’s biggest consumer.  Orange juice  and
sugar also fell, while coffee and cotton gained.  European stocks declined today and the pound weakened
through $1.50 for the first time since July 2010, after an
industry report showed U.K. manufacturing unexpectedly shrank in
February. The economies of the 17 countries that use the euro
will shrink 0.1 percent this year, after contracting 0.5 percent
in 2012, according to the median of 54 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey of economists.  “We always have to look at the idea of a poor global
economy leeching away demand from commodities, cocoa included,”
 Hector Galvan , a senior commodities broker at RJO Futures in
Chicago, said today in an e-mail.  Cocoa for May delivery fell 2.5 percent to $2,082 a metric
ton at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , the biggest drop
for a most-active contract since Jan. 22 and the lowest closing
price since June 1. In  London , cocoa for May delivery fell 1.6
percent to 1,406 pounds ($2,112) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe,
marking a 19 percent drop from a closing high on Sept. 6.  Also in New York, orange-juice futures for May delivery
tumbled 5.4 percent to $1.2095 a pound on ICE, the biggest loss
since Dec. 31.  “There are no weather concerns, so people are getting
out,” after money managers boosted their bets on a rally during
the past two weeks, John Ortelle, a vice president for McKeany-
Flavell Co., a broker in Oakland,  California , said in a
telephone interview.  Florida Weather  While a cold snap approaching the northern sections of
 Florida ’s citrus belt will drop temperatures to the upper 30s
Fahrenheit (3.3 degrees Celsius) on March 3, it will not pose a
threat to orange groves, Joel Widenor, the director of
agricultural services for Bethesda, Maryland-based Commodity
Weather Group LLC, said today in a telephone interview.  Raw-sugar futures for May delivery retreated 2.6 percent to
17.91 cents a pound in New York.  Coffee futures for May delivery gained 0.1 percent to
$1.4335 a pound on ICE, while cotton futures for delivery in May
