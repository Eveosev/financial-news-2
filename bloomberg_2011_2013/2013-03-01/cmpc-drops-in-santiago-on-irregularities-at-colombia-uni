Empresas CMPC SA (CMPC) ,  Chile ’s second-
largest pulp exporter, fell to the lowest price in almost two
months after disclosing accounting irregularities at its
Colombian operations that will lead to a $37 million charge.  CMPC fell 1.3 percent to 1,800.3 pesos at the close in
Santiago, its lowest price since Jan. 3. The stock was the
second-worst performer today on Chile’s benchmark  Ipsa index ,
which rose 0.3 percent.  The Santiago-based company discovered that its Colombian
tissue-paper unit had falsely stated revenue, assets and
liabilities from 2008 to 2012, according to a  statement  on the
website of Chile’s securities regulator. CMPC plans a
restatement that will result in a $37 million charge to 2012 and
prior years’ results, CMPC said.  “The whole amount won’t be reflected on last year’s
results, but it will definitely destroy value,” Felipe Burr, an
analyst at  Invertironline-Fit Corredora de Bolsa SA , said in
phone interview. “It should continue pressuring the stock next
week.”  CMPC had a profit of $166 million in the first nine months
of 2012 and is expected to report profit of $90.3 million in the
fourth quarter, based on the average estimate of three analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
