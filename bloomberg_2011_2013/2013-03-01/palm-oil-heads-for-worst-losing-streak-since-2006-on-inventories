Palm oil  fell for an eighth day, the
worst run in almost seven years, on speculation that declining
exports may keep inventories near record high in  Malaysia , the
largest producer after  Indonesia .  The contract for May delivery dropped as much as 1.1
percent to 2,370 ringgit ($766) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, and ended the morning session at 2,377
ringgit in Kuala Lumpur. The losing streak is the longest since
March 2006. Futures tumbled 6.3 percent last month.  Palm, used in foods, biofuels and cosmetics, has slumped 28
percent in the past year as supply and stockpiles surged to
records and demand for the tropical oil fell due to a global
economic slowdown. Inventories in January were at 2.58 million
tons, holding near an all-time high of 2.63 million tons in
December, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. Exports
declined 9.1 percent to 1.33 million tons in February from the
previous month, surveyor Intertek said yesterday.  “We were hoping to see an increase in exports but it was a
decline month-on-month, and that’s one of the factors that
pressured prices,” said Benny Lee, chief market strategist at
Jupiter Securities Sdn. in  Kuala Lumpur . “Inventories will
probably stay at these levels.”  An increase in Malaysia’s export taxes on crude palm oil
this month will curb demand, Lee said. A 4.5 percent tax will be
imposed on shipments in March after allowing duty-free exports
in the first two months of this year.  Soybean oil  for May was little changed at 49.14 cents a
pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for May delivery
were also little changed at $14.5275 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September was little
changed at 6,632 yuan ($1,066) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange . Soybean oil for delivery in the same month declined as
much as 0.8 percent to 8,224  yuan  a ton, the lowest price for
the most-active futures since September 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
