President  Barack Obama  and Russian
President Vladimir Putin had a “constructive conversation” on
issues including containing Iran’s nuclear program and dealing
with the violence in in Syria, the White House said.  Obama, who called his Russian counterpart, “welcomed
strong U.S.-Russian cooperation” in addressing Iran’s nuclear
program in the talks involving the so-called P5+1 -- the U.S.,
U.K., France, Germany, China and Russia, the administration said
in a statement.  The two men also discussed this week’s meetings on Syria
between Secretary of State  John Kerry  and Russian Foreign
Minister  Sergei Lavrov  in Berlin.  “The two Presidents agreed on the need to advance a
political transition to end the violence as soon as possible and
the importance of Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov
continuing their engagement on Syria,” the White House said.  Russia has supplied Syrian President Bashar al-Assad with
weapons and vetoed United Nations sanctions against the country.  In addition, Obama and Putin discussed the “path toward a
more substantial trade and investment relationship between the
United States and Russia,” the White House said.  Obama and Putin will meet in June at the Group of 8 Summit
in Northern Ireland, and the U.S. president will visit St.
Petersburg, Russia, for the Group of 20 meeting in September,
the White House said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
