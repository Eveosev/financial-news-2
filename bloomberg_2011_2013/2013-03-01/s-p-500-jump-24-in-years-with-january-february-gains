The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has
returned 24 percent on average in years it’s risen in both
January and February, a bullish sign for 2013, according to S&P.  The S&P 500 climbed in both January and February 26 times
since 1945, Sam Stovall, S&P’s New York-based chief equity
strategist, wrote in a note. All 26 years ended with positive
returns when including dividends, the data show. The benchmark
gauge for U.S. equities returned 5.2 percent in January and 1.4
percent in February this year including dividends.  Should the S&P 500 follow the historical average, the index
would climb to about 1,730 by the end of the year, surpassing
the  all-time high of 1,565.15  reached in October 2007 and
topping all 15 forecasts from Wall Street strategists tracked by
Bloomberg. The gauge rose 0.2 percent to 1,518.20  today ,
climbing to about 3 percent below the record, after slipping
yesterday when the Senate voted to keep $85 billion of automatic
spending cuts in place.  “Even though the investing community faces economic and
legislative hurdles in the near and long term, equity prices
have risen in both January and February signaling, in our view,
that many of these worries are unwarranted,” Stovall wrote in
the note dated Feb. 25. “Since 1945, bucking the typical
groundhog giveback has been a plus.”  The last two years have seen back-to-back gains in the
first two months, leading the S&P 500 to a 16 percent advance in
2012 and a 2.1 percent rise in 2011, including dividends. The
biggest advance when the index rose in January and February was
the 52 percent rally in 1954.  To contact the reporter on this story:
