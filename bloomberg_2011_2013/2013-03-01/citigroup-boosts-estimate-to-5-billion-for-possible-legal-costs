Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. bank, increased its estimate for possible costs from legal
and regulatory matters to $5 billion amid probes into the
lender’s conduct prior to the financial crisis.  The estimate, disclosed today in an annual filing, compares
with $4 billion at the end of September and covers potential
costs for which Citigroup hasn’t already put aside reserves, the
New York-based lender said.  Citigroup Chief Executive Officer  Michael Corbat  and other
Wall Street CEOs are still dealing with fallout from the 2008
financial crisis. U.S. regulators continue to probe the lender’s
“mortgage-related” conduct, while Citigroup faces litigation
from private investors in securities that lost value, filings
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
