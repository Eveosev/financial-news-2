India will probably miss a deficit
target set yesterday by finance minister Palaniappan Chidambaram
as his budget plan to narrow the nation’s fiscal gap is based on
“highly questionable” tax and spending assumptions, BNP
Paribas SA said.  The deficit will overshoot the target of 4.8 percent of
gross domestic product presented to parliament yesterday by at
least 0.5 percent of GDP unless the nation’s economy grows
faster than forecast,  Richard Iley , an analyst at BNP, wrote in
a report dated yesterday.  “The honeymoon is over,” Iley wrote. “Chidambaram has
been a breath of fresh air since his appointment last August,
but now he hopes to reverse cuts in 2014 and has pencilled in a
capex boom financed by populist tax hikes on the rich, a sharp
pick-up in disinvestment proceeds and implausible control of
subsidy spending.”  Total expenditure will climb to 16.7 trillion rupees ($307
billion) in 2013-2014 from an estimated 14.3 trillion rupees
this financial year, budget documents showed. Gross market
borrowing was set at a record 6.29 trillion rupees for
2013-2014, an increase of almost 13 percent. Net borrowing will
be 4.84 trillion rupees.  Government spending  has contributed to inflation of almost
7 percent, which has limited the extent of  interest-rate cuts  by
the central bank in an economy that expanded last quarter at the
weakest pace since 2009.  Chidambaram allocated 330 billion rupees for the ruling
coalition’s flagship rural jobs program and 100 billion rupees
for a plan to give the poor cheap food grains, ahead of a
general election due by 2014.  Government Spending  A report yesterday showed GDP rose 4.5 percent in the three
months to Dec. 31 from a year earlier, lower than forecast and
the weakest pace in almost four years, as cooling investment, a
drop in exports and government spending cuts sapped growth.  The government will announce another set of decisions
during a reply to the budget speech in parliament, Chidambaram
said in a briefing yesterday. The immediate goal is to move GDP
growth above 6 percent, he said.  India  is targeting a growth
rate of of 7 percent in FY15, he added.  Chidambaram imposed a one-year 10 percent tax surcharge on
annual personal incomes above 10 million rupees and increased
customs duties on yachts, high-end motorcycles and luxury cars.
He raised the surcharge on some companies to 10 percent.  ‘Too High’  Projected spending on a subsidy program ranging from diesel
to food and fertilizers will decline about 11 percent to 2.2
trillion rupees in 2013-2014. Oil subsidies will decline 33
percent to 650 billion rupees.  Revenue assumptions are “too high,” Credit Suisse AG
analysts Neelkanth Mishra and Ravi Shankar wrote in a note dated
yesterday. Increased spending will be “supportive of growth”
and could “hurt the current-account deficit and the currency,”
they wrote.  “The deficit could be much higher than budgeted,”
according to the Credit Suisse report.  Indian rupee one-month non-deliverable forwards dropped to
near a six-week low of 54.90 per dollar today. The currency many
weaken to 55 per dollar in three months, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. forecast.  The S&P BSE Sensex sank 1.5 percent to 18,861.54 yesterday,
ending February with a drop of 5.2 percent, its first monthly
loss since October. The Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR Index
tumbled 1.8 percent to 1,111.51 in New York, capping a 2.8
percent monthly decline, its biggest since October. SGX CNX
Nifty index futures for March delivery fell 0.8 percent to
5,708.5 at 11:33 a.m. in  Singapore .  Earnings Impact  Chidambaram in 2012 revised the budget-deficit goal for
this financial year to 5.3 percent from 5.1 percent of GDP. He
set a target of narrowing it to 3 percent by 2017. The
shortfall, which was 5.8 percent in 2011-2012, is the widest in
the BRIC group that also includes Brazil, Russia and  China .  Jim O’Neill , chairman of the asset-management division that
coined the BRIC acronym for the biggest  emerging markets  a
decade ago, said Indian markets are not impressed with the
budget. India isn’t “coming to grips with its issue,” O’Neill
said in an interview with ET Now channel yesterday.  The budget lacked “sizzle,” Citigroup Inc. analysts
Aditya Narain and Jitender Tokas wrote in a report dated
yesterday.  The tax increase may cut market earnings by 1 percent to
1.5 percent in the financial year starting April 1, according to
the report. The budget is “marginally positive” for utilities,
capital goods, real estate, energy stocks and negative for auto
companies, according to the Citigroup analysts. Credit Suisse
recommended shares of companies including ITC Ltd., Emami Ltd.,
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Wipro Ltd.  To contact the reporters on this story:
