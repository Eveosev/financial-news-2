Russia  is expected to ship as much
as 10 million metric tons of wheat in 2013-14, less than in the
year ending on June 30, because of record-low stockpiles,
according to Moscow-based consultancy SovEcon.  The grain harvest in Russia, the world’s third-biggest
wheat exporter last season, fell by 25 percent this year after
drought hurt crops, according to Agriculture Ministry figures.
This will lead to “record low” stockpiles of 9.5 million tons
by July 1, Andrey Sizov Sr., director general of SovEcon, said
on the sidelines of the Grain Producers’ Union assembly in
Moscow on Feb. 27. That’s why the country’s wheat exports are
seen at 10 million tons at the most in 2013-14, he said.  Russia is expected to ship 10.5 million tons of wheat this
year, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates.
Shipments reached 9.9 million tons in the July through December
period, according to Russia’s Customs Service  data .  “Export flow has been supported by Siberian wheat from
such areas as Omsk and Kurgan in the first half of this
season,” Sizov said. There’s nothing in those regions now and
shipments have been slowing since November, he said.  Many other regions, including the export-oriented southern
areas, have minimal stocks, Sizov said, without giving a wheat
stock estimate. Grain stockpiles were 19.4 million tons last
year, according to the  Agriculture Ministry .  Russia exported 14.3 million tons of all grain varieties
and legumes so far this season, Sizov said. Shipments, mostly
corn and legumes, are seen at 400,000 tons to 500,000 tons this
month, similar to February. Total grain exports for 2012-13 are
expected to be 15.5 million tons, Sizov said.  The biggest wheat shipper in 2012-13 is expected to be the
U.S. with an estimated 28.6 million tons, according to the USDA.
The European Union and  Canada , each with 18.5 million tons, come
next in the ranking, followed by  Australia  with 16.5 million
tons, and then Russia.  Editor:  To contact the reporter on this story:
