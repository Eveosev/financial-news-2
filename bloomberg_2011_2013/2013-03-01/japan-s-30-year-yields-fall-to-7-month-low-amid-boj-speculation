Japan ’s 30-year bond yields slid to
a seven-month low after government data showed the nation’s
consumer prices fell for a third month, fanning speculation the
central bank will buy longer-maturity debt to end deflation.  The benchmark 10-year yield dropped to the least in almost
a decade ahead of an auction of the bonds next week. Hearings
for nominees for the next  Bank of Japan (8301)  governor and deputies
will be held on March 4-5, Tsutomu Sato, the acting chairman of
the ruling  Liberal Democratic Party ’s parliamentary affairs
committee, told reporters in  Tokyo .  “There are expectations that the BOJ will buy longer-term
debt,” said  Ayako Sera , a market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui
Trust Bank Ltd., which manages about $163 billion in assets.
“The BOJ’s credibility is on trial” as a deflation fighter.  The current 30-year yield slid as much as six basis points
to 1.75 percent, the lowest since July, and was at 1.765 percent
as of 10:59 a.m. in Tokyo. The 1.9 percent security due
September 2042 added 0.889 yen to 102.621, according to Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.  The 20-year yield fell 3 1/2 basis points to 1.57 percent
after touching 1.555 percent, a level unseen since July. The
benchmark 10-year yield reached 0.64 percent, the least since
June 2003. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for March delivery gained 0.07 to
145.09. Lead contracts rose to a record 145.26 on Dec. 7.  Consumer prices  excluding fresh food fell 0.2 percent in
January from a year earlier, government figures showed today.
The so-called core inflation rate has decreased an average of
0.2 percent every month over the past decade.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe nominated Asian Development Bank
President Haruhiko Kuroda yesterday as the next BOJ chief and
economics professor Kikuo Iwata and BOJ official Hiroshi Nakaso
as deputies. Kuroda advocated an inflation target more than a
decade ago, and said last month that additional easing can be
justified for 2013.  The Ministry of Finance will auction as much as 2.4
trillion yen ($26 billion) of 10-year bonds on March 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
