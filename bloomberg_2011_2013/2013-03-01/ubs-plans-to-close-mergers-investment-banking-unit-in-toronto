UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s largest bank,
shut its mergers investment-banking team in Toronto.  Karina Byrne , spokeswoman for the bank in  New York , said
mergers coverage for Canada would be done from New York.  “These changes are part of the investment bank strategy we
announced last fall, and will enable us to better focus on
areas where we can be successful,” Byrne said in an emailed
statement today.  The move comes a month after UBS cut 20 jobs at its
Canadian investment-banking unit as part of cost cuts by the
Zurich-based bank.  UBS said on Jan. 31 said it fired Rick Meslin, head of
Canadian equities, and Chief Economist and Strategist George Vasic as part of the moves that eliminated 10 jobs in equity
research and the rest in cash sales and trading.  UBS said in October it will eliminate 10,000 jobs over
three years and dismantle portions of the investment bank to
increase profitability. Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Ermotti 
is overhauling the bank as Swiss regulators pressure UBS to
boost capital and scale back trading and investment-banking
operations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
