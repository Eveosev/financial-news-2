Gasoline on the  spot market  in
 California  was little changed as  BP Plc (BP/)  delayed the restart of
fuel-making units at its Carson refinery in Southern California.  BP will start a fluid catalytic cracker and alkylation unit
at the 266,000-barrel-a-day refinery between March 4 and March
12, a person familiar with operations at the plant said today.
The company has delayed three times from the originally planned
window of Feb. 9 to Feb. 16.  California-blend gasoline in  Los Angeles  widened its
discount to futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
by 0.25 cent to 4 cents a gallon at 4:05 p.m. New York time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fuel weakened to 6
cents a gallon below futures at  2:02 p.m.  before paring losses.  The fuel in  San Francisco  weakened 0.25 cent to 11.5 cents
a gallon below futures.  Conventional, 84-octane gasoline in  Portland , Oregon,
weakened 0.5 cent to 3.5 cents a gallon below  New York  futures.  California-blend diesel in Los Angeles strengthened by 1.25
cents to a premium of 14.5 cents a gallon above heating oil
futures on the Nymex. The fuel in San Francisco widened its
premium by 1.25 cents to 12 cents a gallon above futures.  Low-sulfur diesel in Portland weakened by 2 cents to 11.5
cents a gallon above futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
