South African wheat futures gained
for a third day as the rand dropped to the weakest level in more
than a month against the dollar, making imports of the grain
more expensive than locally produced varieties.  Wheat for delivery in May, the most active contract, gained
1.6 percent to 3,480 rand ($383) a metric ton, the longest
rising streak since Jan. 22, by the midday close on the South
African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg.  The rand, headed for its biggest weekly drop in five
months, extended its decline today after slumping the most in
Jan. 28 yesterday. It traded 0.6 percent weaker at 9.0757 by
3:43 p.m.  “The rand has weakened a lot against the dollar, that is
why prices are this high,” Benjamin Swanepoel, a trader at
Trademar Futures (Pty) Ltd., said by phone from Johannesburg.  South Africa  is a net importer of wheat and sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s largest producer of the grain after  Ethiopia . The
nation is the region’s biggest importer after Nigeria and  Sudan ,
according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  White corn for delivery in July rose 3.8 percent to 2,190
rand a ton, while the yellow variety for delivery in the same
month gained 3.6 percent to 2,159 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
