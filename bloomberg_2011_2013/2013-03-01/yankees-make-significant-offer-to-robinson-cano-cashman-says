The New York Yankees made “a
significant offer” to  Robinson Cano , who hit a career-high 33
home runs last season for the Major League Baseball team, said
General Manager  Brian Cashman .  “He’s an exceptional high-end player who is a season away
from free agency,” Cashman, who declined to discuss Cano’s
reaction to the offer, said in a video interview on the team’s
website. “Where that takes him and us remains to be seen.”  The 30-year-old second baseman is starting his final season
under contract with the Yankees, who picked up his $15 million
club option in October. Cano batted .313 with 94 runs batted in
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
