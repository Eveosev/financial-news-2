A proposed Great Keppel Island
resort worth A$600 million ($613 million) won approval from
 Australia ’s Queensland state government, the first major new
tourism project in the  Great Barrier Reef  in 25 years.  The plan is for a hotel, eco-resort villas and apartments,
and a marina and a Greg Norman-designed golf course, state
Deputy Premier Jeff Seeney said in a statement today.  “It would provide a huge boost to both the construction
and tourism industries -- two of Queensland’s four key economic
pillars -- creating hundreds of construction jobs over a 12-year
construction period and more than a 1,000 permanent operational
jobs,” Seeney said.  While Queensland, in Australia’s northeast, is also a hub
of the nation’s mining investment boom, its  tourism industry  has
struggled with the appreciation of the local dollar that has
made international visits more expensive. The state jobless rate
fell to 5.5 percent in January from 6.1 percent a month earlier,
compared with a national level of 5.4 percent.  The Great Barrier Reef, home to 1,500 species of fish, is
larger than the Great Wall of  China  and is the only living
object visible from space. It is more than 3,000 kilometers
(1,865 miles) long and runs almost parallel to the Queensland
coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
