Jamaica  will keep open its local
debt exchange to attract more bondholders, a  Finance Ministry 
official said.  About 99 percent of bondholders agreed to exchange J$860
billion ($9 billion) of higher-interest Jamaican dollar debt for
lower-yielding bonds, said Pamella McLaren, head of debt
management at the Finance Ministry.  “I think it’s very good under the circumstances,” McLaren
said in a phone interview from Kingston today. “We’re letting
it remain open for possibility of bondholders who may want to
participate.”  Jamaica’s government will “for the foreseeable future
continue to accept late tenders,” the ministry said in an e-
mailed statement today.  In a national address on Feb. 11, Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller said the drop in interest payments will enable
the government to cut its debt from 140 percent of gross
domestic product to 95 percent over the next seven years.  The Caribbean nation reached a preliminary agreement with
the  International Monetary Fund  for a $750 million loan that
depends “critically on a high rate of participation of private
creditors” in the debt swap, the Washington-based lender said
on Sept. 15. The IMF’s board will consider approving the loan by
the end of March.  Jamaica last restructured debt in 2010, when it swapped
$7.8 billion of local bonds for securities with longer
maturities and lower  interest rates  as the country’s debt burden
exceeded 120 percent of GDP. The accord paved the way for
Moody’s Investors Service to raise Jamaica’s credit rating and
the IMF to approve a 27-month, $1.27 billion standby credit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
