Italy’s budget deficit narrowed in
2012 to match the European Union limit as the austerity policies
passed by outgoing Prime Minister Mario Monti helped shore up
public finances.  The budget shortfall declined to 3.0 percent of  gross
domestic product  from a revised 3.8 percent in 2011, Rome-based
national statistics office  Istat  said today. The shortfall
matched the average forecast of five economist estimates in a
Bloomberg News  survey . The economy contracted 2.4 percent,
topping a 2.2 percent forecast.  Monti’s spending cuts and tax increases coupled with last
year’s pledges by the European Central Bank to save the euro
helped reassure investors and push Italian bond yields lower.
Still, the austerity deepened the country’s fourth recession
since 2011. The policy mix also prompted 25 percent of voters in
last month’s inconclusive election to back the anti-austerity
stance of comedian-turned-politician Beppe Grillo’s Five Star
Movement, now the country’s biggest party.  In addition to the risks of political instability due to
the hung parliament produced by the vote, Italy still faces the
challenge of taming the euro-region’s second biggest debt. Even
though the deficit narrowed, the debt rose to 127 percent of
GDP, the highest in more than two decades, from 120.8 percent in
2011, Istat also said today.  Exports Gain  Italian 10-year yield was little changed at 4.728 percent
at 11:50 a.m. in Rome compared with more than 7 percent before
Monti’s non-elected government took power in November 2011,
replacing the administration led by Silvio Berlusconi.  Today’s GDP report also showed that while consumer spending
fell 4.3 percent last year, exports rose 2.3 percent. Both the
Bank of Italy and the government expect a recovery in the second
half of 2013 led by increasing sales abroad.  That will probably not stop unemployment from rising.
Joblessness will increase this year and next when it reaches 12
percent, European Commission forecasts released on Feb. 22. The
jobless rate rose to 11.7 percent in the first month of 2013,
the highest since the series began in 1992, Istat said earlier
today.  To stem mounting losses in Italy amid lower sales,  Fiat
SpA (F) , the country’s largest manufacturer, intends to transform
underused factories into export hubs for more expensive vehicles
from Jeep, Alfa Romeo and Maserati.  To contact the reporter on this story:
