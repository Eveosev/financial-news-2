Praxair Inc. (PX) , the biggest U.S.
producer of industrial gases such as hydrogen, cut its first-
quarter earnings forecast by 8 cents a share after Venezuela
devalued its currency.  Net income will now be $1.27 to $1.32 a share, Danbury,
Connecticut-based Praxair said today in a statement. It
projected $1.35 to $1.40 in January. Net income was expected to
be $1.41, according to the average of seven analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Venezuela last month weakened the  exchange rate  by 32
percent to 6.3 bolivars per dollar, the fifth devaluation in
nine years. A spending spree that almost tripled the fiscal
deficit last year helped ailing President  Hugo Chavez , 58, win a
third six-year term. The devaluation can help narrow the  budget
deficit  by increasing the amount of bolivars the government
receives from oil exports.  The 8-cent-a-share expense is “due primarily to the
remeasurement of the local Venezuelan balance sheet to reflect
the new official exchange rate,” Praxair said in its annual
filing. Praxair has less than 1 percent of sales and net assets
in Venezuela, the company said.  Praxair Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Stephen Angel
is expanding into beverage carbonation services for restaurants
with its $1.1 billion purchase of  NuCO2 Inc. (NUCO) , a deal that the
company said closed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
