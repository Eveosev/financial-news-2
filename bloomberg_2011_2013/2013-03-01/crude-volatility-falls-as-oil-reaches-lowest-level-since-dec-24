Crude options volatility slid as
underlying futures fell to the lowest level since Dec. 24 amid
concerns that fuel demand will decline.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 20.76 percent at 4:50 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 20.93 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery dropped
$1.37, or 1.5 percent, to settle at $90.68 a barrel on the Nymex
as reports showed manufacturing contracted in  China  and the euro
area. Prices touched $90.04 after trading in an intraday range
from $91.57 to $94.92 for the previous six days.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
April $83 puts, which rose 7 cents to 14 cents a barrel on
volume of 5,771 contracts at 4:52 p.m. in  New York . April $95
calls were the second-most active with 3,517 lots. They declined
25 cents to 19 cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 53 percent of electronic trading volume.
In the previous session, bearish bets made up 58 percent of the
116,220 contracts traded.  June $80 puts were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 6,071 contracts changing hands. They were down 7
cents to 77 cents a barrel. June $97.50 calls fell 42 cents to
$1.77 on 4,545 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $105 calls with
35,244 contracts. Next were April $110 calls at 34,233 and June
$90 puts at 32,440.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
