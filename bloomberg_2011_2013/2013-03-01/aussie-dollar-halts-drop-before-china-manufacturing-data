Australia’s dollar rose versus most
of its 16 major counterparts on prospects  Reserve Bank  officials
meeting next week will refrain from cutting borrowing costs.  The so-called Aussie climbed for a third day against the
yen and reversed an earlier decline versus the dollar, following
reports that signaled a slowdown in Chinese manufacturing
expansion.  New Zealand ’s currency, known as the kiwi,
strengthened versus the dollar and yen as a pullback in Asian
stock losses outweighed data today that showed an unexpected
drop in the country’s terms of trade.  “The RBA is in wait-and-see mode,” said  Andrew Salter , a
currency strategist at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. (ANZ)  In Sydney. “We’re coming to the bottom of the range in the
Aussie. We see value at current levels.” ANZ predicts the
Australian currency will trade at $1.05 by Dec. 31.  The Aussie added 0.2 percent to $1.0235 as of 4:48 p.m. in
Sydney, set for a weekly drop of 0.8 percent. It gained 0.2
percent to 94.76 yen.  New Zealand’s currency rose 0.3 percent to 82.74 U.S.
cents. It’s poised to fall 1.3 percent this week, the biggest
decline since Dec. 21. It climbed 0.3 percent to 76.60 yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares was little changed
after earlier falling as much as 0.4 percent.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see an 82 percent chance RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  will keep
his nation’s key interest rate at 3 percent on March 5.  China Slowing  China ’s manufacturing  Purchasing Managers ’ Index dropped to
50.1 last month from 50.4 in January, the National Bureau of
Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said
today in Beijing. That compares with a 50.5 median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists before the report. China is
Australia’s largest trading partner.  A similar gauge of Chinese factory output by HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics fell to 50.4 in February from 52.3 in
the previous month. Analysts in a separate poll predicted a
decline to 50.6.  In New Zealand, a government report showed the  terms of
trade  declined 1.3 percent in the three months through December
from the previous quarter, when it fell 3.2 percent. Analysts
polled by Bloomberg expected a 1.2 percent gain.  Australia’s 10-year government bond yield slid one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, 3.34 percent. New Zealand’s
two-year  swap rate , a fixed payment made to receive floating
rates that are sensitive to expectations for borrowing costs,
was at 2.96 percent from 2.97 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
