David Einhorn ’s Greenlight Capital
Inc. will drop its lawsuit against Apple Inc. over a preferred
share measure after the iPad maker agreed to withdraw the
disputed proposal.  “Plaintiffs intend to voluntarily withdraw their
complaint,” U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in  Manhattan 
said in an order dated yesterday.  Greenlight won an injunction Feb. 22 barring Apple from
moving forward with a shareholder vote on a measure that could
have curtailed the company’s ability to issue preferred shares.
The judge sided with the hedge fund’s contentions that the
measure was improperly bundled with other items up for vote.  The hedge fund and its founder, Einhorn, have urged Apple
to issue high-yielding preferred shares to spread the company’s
cash hoard among investors.  “Apple removed the bundled proposal from the shareholder
meeting, therefore resolving the issue,” Jonathan Gasthalter, a
spokesman for New York-based Greenlight, said in an e-mail.  Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Cupertino, California-based
Apple, declined to comment on the case.  The case is Greenlight Capital LP v.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , 13-
cv-00900, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
