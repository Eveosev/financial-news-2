Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  junior
bonds rose after the partially state-owned U.K. lender exercised
an option to redeem 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) of notes.  Morgan Stanley analysts said yesterday they were
“surprised” that Lloyds redeemed the bonds, the lender’s first
such move since 2009. They said that, while “cautious” about
Lloyds’s more junior Tier 1 securities, they recommended buying
its outstanding lower Tier 2 bonds.  The price of the 5.625 percent lower Tier 2 notes that
Lloyds will redeem at face value on March 5 jumped to 99.6 cents
on the euro as of 8:25 a.m. in  London , from 96.9 at the end of
last week, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
lender’s 750 million euros of 4.375 percent senior subordinated
notes due 2019 with a call next year jumped to 97.4 from 94.6.  Lloyds’s sterling-denominated bonds with calls also rose.
Its 750 million pounds ($1.1 billion) of senior subordinated
notes due 2020 with a redemption option five years before that
increased to 102.6 from 100.8, Bloomberg prices show.  Lloyds, Britain’s biggest mortgage lender,  reported  a full-
year loss of 1.43 billion pounds today after setting aside money
to compensate customers wrongly sold loan insurance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
