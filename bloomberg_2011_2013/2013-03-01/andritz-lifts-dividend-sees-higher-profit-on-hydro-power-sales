Andritz AG (ANDR) , the world’s second-
biggest hydro-turbine maker, lifted its payout to shareholders
and forecast higher 2013 profit even as sectors of the global
economy stagnate.  The company proposed a 1.20 euros a share dividend compared
with 1.10 euros a year earlier after full-year net income rose 6
percent to 243.6 million euros ($318.6 million), the Graz,
Austria-based company said today in a statement. Revenue
increased 13 percent to 5.18 billion euros. Analysts had
estimated a profit of 245.3 million euros and sales of 5.15
billion euros, according to a Bloomberg survey.  “We expect no significant recovery of the global economy
also in this year,” Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Leitner
said in the statement, without giving detailed 2013 revenue or
profit targets. “We still see solid development with good
project activity in the markets.”  Andritz, which gained 51 percent last year on the Vienna
stock exchange, has expanded outside  Austria  to boost sales and
profit. It won contracts to supply equipment in countries
including  Brazil ,  China  and  Russia . The company will consolidate
earnings from  Schuler AG (SCUN) , the German metal company it acquired
last year, from March 1.  Job Cuts  “Schuler has never made as much revenue and profit as last
year,” Leitner said at a press conference. “It’s certainly a
peak in the performance,” he said, adding that he expects
restructuring will be needed at the company, and he didn’t rule
out job cuts.  Andritz’s shares fell 2.2 percent to 52.85 euros at 12:37
a.m. in Vienna.  “The stock has had a strong run over the last months,”
Thomas Neuhold, an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets, wrote in a
note to clients. “Further share-price gains seem rather
difficult.”  Fourth-quarter net income fell 4.7 percent to 76.4 million
euros. Sales rose 4.4 percent to 1.41 billion euros. The company
was predicted to lift its dividend to 1.25 euros a share,
according to a Bloomberg dividend forecast.  To contact the reporters on this story:
