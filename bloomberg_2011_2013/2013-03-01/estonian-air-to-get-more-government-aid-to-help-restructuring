AS Estonian Air will get a new
government rescue loan of 16.6 million euros ($21.7 million)
even as the European Commission probes if earlier injections for
the national carrier followed the bloc’s state aid rules.  The Cabinet decided to increase a December rescue loan of
8.3 million euros to ensure “a successful restructuring” of
the carrier, according to an e-mailed statement from the
government press office yesterday.  The European Union executive said on Feb. 20 it will
examine about 65.5 million euros in capital increases given to
the carrier by the Cabinet of Premier Andrus Ansip since 2009,
similar to probes of Slovenia’s Adria Airways d.d. and  Latvia ’s
AirBaltic AS announced last November, as nations have been
propping up carriers weighed down by the bloc’s sovereign debt
crisis and high  oil prices .  The  Economy Ministry  will file a request with the
commission to expand rescue loans for the company as much as 37
million euros by March 4 at the latest, the government said.
Further decisions on rescue loans will be made after the company
files a restructuring plan, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
