weekly decline against the dollar, after a gauge of Spanish
manufacturing in February shrank less than economists forecast.  The single currency appreciated versus 13 of its 16 major
counterparts after Market Economics said the final reading of is
Spanish Purchasing Managers Index increased to 46.8 from 46.1 in
January. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast an increase to
46.3. The  Dollar Index (DXY)  dropped amid speculation automatic
spending cuts in the U.S. will stifle a recovery in the world’s
biggest economy.  The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.3084 at 8:43 a.m. London
time, trimming its weekly loss to 0.9 percent. The shared
currency strengthened 0.2 percent to 121.14 yen. The dollar was
little changed at 92.66 yen.  The euro weakened against 14 of its 16 major counterparts
in February, losing 3.8 percent against the greenback and 3
percent versus the yen. The dollar strengthened 0.9 percent
against  Japan ’s currency, a fifth monthly gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
