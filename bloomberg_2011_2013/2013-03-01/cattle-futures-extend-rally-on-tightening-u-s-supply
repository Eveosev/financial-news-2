Cattle futures climbed to a three-
week high on signs of increasing demand for U.S. beef and the
outlook for tighter supplies. Hogs also rose.  Meatpackers processed 426,000 head of cattle in the first
four days of this week, down 4.3 percent from a week earlier,
U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  Steers  averaged $1.26
a pound in the first three days of this week, up 2.6 percent
from $1.2282 a week earlier, USDA data show.  “The combination of the cash market and the lower
slaughter, that’s really the driving force” behind today’s
rally,  Christian Mayer , a market adviser at Northstar Commodity
Investments Co., said in a telephone interview from  Minneapolis .  Cattle futures for April delivery rose 0.5 percent to
$1.30475 a pound at 9:48 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after reaching $1.30725, the highest for the most-
active contract since Feb. 8. The commodity dropped 2.2 percent
in February, snapping a four-month rally.  Wholesale  beef  prices have climbed 1.8 percent this week to
$1.8616 a pound yesterday, heading for the biggest weekly gain
since Oct. 19, USDA data show.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement added 0.3 percent
to $1.4845 a pound.  Hog futures for April settlement increased 0.8 percent to
81.675 cents a pound on the CME. Prices fell 9.3 percent last
month, the biggest decline since July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
