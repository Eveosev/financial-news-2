Natural gas futures retreated from a
one-month high in New York as signs of warmer weather signaled
reduced heating-fuel demand.  Gas declined 0.9 percent. Midday weather models pointed to
higher temperatures in the East, South and Midwest, said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,
Maryland. Prices rose in earlier trading amid forecasts for a
late winter storm next week.  “The fundamentals of the market don’t point to higher
 price levels  unless there’s higher seasonal demand,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
Stamford,  Connecticut .  Natural gas for April delivery fell 3 cents to settle at
$3.456 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 17 percent below the
100-day average at 3:09 p.m. Prices reached $3.486 yesterday,
the highest settlement since Jan. 23. Futures rose 5 percent
this week and are up 3.1 percent this year.  Temperatures may trend warmer beginning March 8 in the U.S.
Midwest and East Coast, according to MDA Weather Services. The
Gaithersburg,  Maryland , forecaster said temperatures in Chicago
may reach a high of 47 degrees Fahrenheit (8 Celsius) that day,
compared with 34 degrees on March 4.  April $3.50 calls were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They fell 1.8 cents to 9 cents per million
Btu at 2:32 p.m. as 761 contracts were exchanged. Calls
accounted for 56 percent of options volume.  Gas Production  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical division.  Natural gas output in the lower-48 states was 72.7 billion
cubic feet a day in December, the EIA said in its monthly
EIA-914 report yesterday. Production was up 0.6 percent from
December 2011, the smallest annual gain since 2009.  Gas production rose to a record 28.5 trillion cubic feet in
2011, led by record output from shale deposits, the EIA said in
an annual report on Jan. 7.  Inventories of the heating fuel fell 171 billion cubic feet
to 2.229 trillion cubic feet in the week ended Feb. 22, the EIA
said yesterday.  Gas prices  at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana,
will average $3.53 per million British thermal units in 2013,
compared with $2.75 per million Btu last year, the EIA said in
its Feb. 12 monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook.  Gas rigs  declined by eight to 420, the lowest level of
2013, according to data posted today on  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) ’s
website.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 84 percent of its
energy needs in the first 11 months of last year, government
data show. If the trend continued through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
