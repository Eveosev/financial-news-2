The cost to protect against an
Argentine default jumped for a second day after the country said
it would halt payments on restructured bonds if a U.S. court
ordered it to pay defaulted debt holders $1.33 billion.  The nation’s five-year credit-default swaps soared 874
basis points, or 8.74 percentage points, to 3,629 basis points
at 9:16 a.m. in  New York , data compiled by Bloomberg show. Since
 Argentina ’s Feb. 27 hearing with the  U.S. Court of Appeals , the
swaps have surged 1,280 basis points, the biggest two-day gain
on record. One-year swaps have soared 2,429 basis points in the
period to 7,610, the highest in the world.  Speculation is increasing that Argentina will opt to
default on performing debt if the three-judge panel declines to
overturn a lower-court ruling forcing the country to pay a group
of investors led by NML Capital Ltd. who hold debt from the
nation’s 2001 default. Argentina’s attorney, Jonathan Blackman,
said at the Feb. 27 hearing that the South American country
wouldn’t “voluntarily obey” such an order.  The CDS market is reflecting “an aggressive stance and a
positioning where things are going to go against Argentina,”
Ray Zucaro, a  fund manager  who helps oversee about $280 million
of emerging-market debt at SW Asset Management LLC, said in a
telephone interview yesterday.  The extra yield, or spread, that investors demand to hold
Argentine government dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries
surged 173 basis points yesterday to 1,287 basis points, the
highest in  emerging markets  after Belize, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global index. The spread narrowed 11 basis
point today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
