The National Football League salary
cap will be $123 million next season, the  Associated Press 
reported, citing an unidentified players’ union official
familiar with the decision.  The increase from $120.6 million is a result of higher-
than-expected revenues last season, primarily from NFL
Properties, and an increase in projected league revenues, said
the NFL Players Association official, according to AP.  There was no salary cap in 2010, the final year of the old
collective bargaining agreement, AP said. In 2011, the first
year under the present deal, the figure was $120.38 million.  During the next four seasons, from 2013-16, each of the
NFL’s 32 clubs will be required to spend an average of at least
89 percent of the salary cap in contract dollars, while overall
league spending must average 95 percent under rules of the new
10-year labor deal, AP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
