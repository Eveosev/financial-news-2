0.3 percent to 1,543.804.  CRUDE OIL  West Texas Intermediate oil dropped to the lowest price

level since November as China’s manufacturing data trailed
economists’ forecasts, a signal that recovery in the largest
user of metals may be losing steam.  Copper for three-month delivery dropped as much as 0.7
percent to $7,760 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, the
lowest since Dec. 20, and was at $7,780 at 3:17 p.m. Shanghai
time. Aluminum lost as much as 0.6 percent to $1,993.25 a ton,
the lowest since Nov. 28.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold swung between gains and losses, after the longest run
of monthly declines since 1997, as investors weighed improving
global economic data amid speculation that central banks will
press on with stimulus.  Gold for immediate delivery was at $1,579.41 an ounce at
3:46 p.m. in Singapore from $1,579.58 yesterday. Prices are set
to decline 0.1 percent this week after dropping 5.1 percent in
February for the fifth monthly drop as investment holdings
plunged 4.2 percent. Bullion for April delivery was little
changed at $1,578.90 on the Comex in New York.  Cash bullion of 99.99 percent purity on the Shanghai Gold
Exchange lost 1 percent to 320.70  yuan  a gram ($1,602.89 an
ounce). Most-active futures were little changed at 29,550 rupees
per 10 grams ($1,686.40 an ounce) on the  Multi Commodity
Exchange of India Ltd. (MCX)   Silver for immediate delivery was little changed at $28.53
an ounce, poised for a fourth weekly loss. Platinum dropped as
much as 0.6 percent to $1,574.37 an ounce, the lowest since Jan.
8. The metal is set for a third weekly fall. Palladium declined
0.4 percent to $725.85 an ounce.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Palm oil fell for an eighth day, the worst run in almost
seven years, on speculation that declining exports may keep
inventories near a record high in Malaysia, the largest producer
after Indonesia.  The contract for May delivery dropped as much as 1.1
percent to 2,370 ringgit ($765) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, and was at 2,389 ringgit at 3:48 p.m. in
Kuala Lumpur. The losing streak is the longest since March 2006.
Futures tumbled 6.3 percent last month.  Wheat advanced for a fourth day, the longest rally in six
weeks, as spot prices traded at a discount to corn and importers
locked in supplies before the U.S. harvest.  Wheat for May delivery climbed as much as 0.9 percent to
$7.2125 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, and was at $7.20
at 2:04 p.m. in Singapore on trading volume that was 33 percent
more than the 100-day average for that time. The last time the
most-active contract rose for four days was in Jan. 16. Futures
are up 0.2 percent this week for the first gain in six weeks.  Corn for May delivery added 0.3 percent to $7.0575 a bushel
in Chicago, set for a 3.1 percent advance this week. Soybeans
for May delivery were little changed at $14.5325 a bushel,
poised for a second weekly increase. That puts the price of
soybeans at 2.06 times the cost of corn, compared with a 10-year
average of 2.43 times. The two crops compete for acreage.  Rubber extended a decline after falling in February, on
concern that demand for the commodity may weaken after
manufacturing growth slowed in China and Japan’s consumer prices
dropped.  The contract for delivery in August lost as much as 2.3
percent to 286.3 yen a kilogram ($3,089 a metric ton) before
trading at 286.6 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange at 11:49
