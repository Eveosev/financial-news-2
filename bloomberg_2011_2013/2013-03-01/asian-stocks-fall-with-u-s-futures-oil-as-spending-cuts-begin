U.S. stocks rose, reversing early
losses, as  consumer confidence  increased and manufacturing grew
at the fastest pace since June 2011, easing concern about the
economy as $85 billion of federal spending cuts were set to
begin. Commodities fell and the pound and euro slumped.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent to close
at 1,518.20  after dropping  as much as 0.9 percent earlier. The
gain left the benchmark gauge up almost 0.2 percent for the
week. The S&P GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials slid 0.9 percent to
a two-month low as lead, aluminum, copper and oil helped lead
losses. The euro dipped below $1.30 for the first time in eight
weeks and the pound traded for less than $1.50 for the first
time since 2010. Sweden’s currency rallied as economic growth
beat estimates.  The better-than-estimated U.S. data helped the market
recover following reports that showed  China ’s  manufacturing 
slowed for a second month while factory output in the euro area
contracted for the 19th straight month. The  U.S. Senate  rejected
a pair of partisan proposals to replace the automatic across-
the-board spending reductions which the  International Monetary
Fund  says will hurt global growth.  “A couple economic data points are reminding the market
that the sequestration is an issue, it’s an issue that was
known, but the underlying fundamental data continued to improve
slightly,” Andres Garcia-Amaya, New York-based global market
strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s mutual funds unit, which
oversees $400 billion in assets, said in a phone interview.  Dow’s Record  Stocks erased gains in the final minutes of trading
yesterday after the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed to
within 16 points of its record set in 2007. The Dow added 35.17
points to 14,089.66 today, its highest closing level since
October 2007, the month it set an all-time high of 14,164.53.
Bank of America Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc., International
Business Machines Corp. and Walt Disney Co. climbed at least 1
percent to lead gains in the Dow today.  Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  rallied 13 percent as the largest daily-deal
website ousted  Andrew Mason  as chief executive officer. The
shares sank 24 percent yesterday after its revenue forecast
missed analysts’ estimates.  Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG) , which
plunged 11 percent yesterday after U.S. regulators said they
were probing the safety of its robots, rebounded 8.5 percent
today. Cantor Fitzgerald LP  analyst  Jeremy Feffer raised his
rating to buy from hold, saying he saw limited risk from the
investigation.  Economic Data  Stocks began erasing early losses this morning as the
 Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index advanced to 54.2
last month from 53.1 in January, exceeding the most optimistic
forecast in a Bloomberg survey in which the median projection
was 52.5. A reading greater than 50 signals expansion. The
Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment
increased to 77.6 in February, topping the median estimate of
76.3.  Government data showed household purchases, which account
for about 70 percent of the economy, climbed 0.2 percent after a
0.1 percent gain the prior month. Personal incomes decreased 3.6
percent, more than forecast and the most in 20 years, as payroll
taxes increased.  The  S&P 500  has returned 24 percent on average in years
it’s risen in both January and February, a bullish sign for
2013, according to S&P. The S&P 500 climbed in both January and
February 26 times since 1945,  Sam Stovall , S&P’s New York-based
chief equity strategist, wrote in a note. All 26 years ended
with positive returns when including dividends, the data show.
The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities returned 5.2 percent in
January and 1.4 percent in February of this year including
dividends.  ‘Legislative Hurdles’  “Even though the investing community faces economic and
legislative hurdles in the near and long term, equity prices
have risen in both January and February signaling, in our view,
that many of these worries are unwarranted,” Stovall wrote in
the note dated Feb. 25. “Since 1945, bucking the typical
groundhog giveback has been a plus.”  The S&P GSCI of commodities fell to the lowest level of the
year and capped its fourth weekly decline, the longest streak
since June. West Texas Intermediate oil dropped 1.5 percent to
$90.68 a barrel. Copper traded in London slipped 1.4 percent to
the lowest since November and aluminum retreated for a 10th day,
the longest slump since June. China is the biggest buyer of
energy and industrial metals.  Coal Slumps  European coal for 2014 fell as much as 1.1 percent to a
record $97.10 a metric ton as Deutsche Bank AG said China’s
anti-pollution efforts may turn the country into a net exporter
of the fuel in 2015. Shares of coal producers Consol Energy
Inc., Peabody Energy Corp., Arch Coal Inc. and Walter Energy
Inc. each slumped more than 4 percent.  The dollar led gains in world markets last month, beating
global measures of bonds, stocks and commodities, as the threat
of U.S. budget cuts proved no barrier to investors snapping up
American assets.  Japan  overtook China last year as the largest
foreign holder of U.S. securities, including equities, asset-
backed debt and Treasuries, the U.S. Treasury Department said.  The  Dollar Index , which tracks the currency against six
U.S. trading partners, climbed 0.4 percent today. Treasuries
advanced for a second day, with the yield on 10-year notes
falling three basis points to 1.84 percent.  European Markets  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index erased most of an earlier 1.1
percent plunge, leaving the gauge down 0.3 percent today and up
0.2 percent for the week.  The index climbed for nine months
through February, the longest run of gains since 1997.  Thales SA surged 12 percent as Europe’s biggest maker of
defense electronics reported earnings that topped estimates and
started a review of regional and product focus to improve
profitability.  Belgacom SA (BELG) , the largest phone company in
 Belgium , fell 5.6 percent to a record low after forecasting
earnings that trailed analyst estimates. Royal Vopak NV, the
world’s biggest chemical and oil storage company, tumbled 11
percent as operating profit declined.  The euro slid 0.3 percent to $1.3023 after sliding as low
as $1.2967, the weakest since December. The shared currency
declined against 12 of 16 major peers.  The pound fell against 15 of its 16 main counterparts and
the yield on the 10-year gilt fell 10 basis points to 1.87
percent. A gauge of factory activity sank to 47.9, compared with
a revised 50.5 in January and less than the 51 reading in a
Bloomberg survey.  The krona climbed to its strongest level against the euro
since September after Sweden avoided the contraction most
economists predicted in the fourth quarter. The krona
appreciated 0.8 percent to 8.3777 per euro.  Japan Bonds  Japanese bonds surged after a report showed lingering
deflation. The 10-year bond  yield  touched 0.64 percent, the
lowest since June 2003. The  Bank of Japan (8301)  may add monetary
stimulus as early as April as prospective governor  Haruhiko
Kuroda  looks to demonstrate a more aggressive approach to
tackling 15 years of falling prices. The yen weakened against
all 16 major peers.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  slipped 0.1 percent. The
Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies fell 0.8
percent and the Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.3 percent.
The official  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was 50.1 in February,
the weakest in five months and less than the 50.5 median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 31 analysts. Commodity
producers led Russia’s Micex Index down 0.8 percent and Brazil’s
Bovespa index lost 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
