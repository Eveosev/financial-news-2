Steel reinforcement-bar futures fell
for the first time in three days amid high inventory levels in
China, the biggest user, and waning demand in the  spot market .  Rebar for delivery in October dropped as much as 2 percent
to 3,971  yuan  ($638) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange and traded at 3,982 at the 11:30 a.m. midday break.  Inventory jumped 68 percent this year through Feb. 22,
according to Shanghai Steelhome Information. The average spot
 price  for rebar fell 0.6 percent to 3,790 yuan a ton yesterday,
its fifth straight loss, according to data from Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  “The main concern in the market is still the weak spot
demand and the rising inventory,” Xu Jiashun, an analyst at
Yongan Futures Co., said by phone from Hangzhou today. “That
will keep a lid on prices for now.”  Iron ore  for immediate delivery was little changed at
$151.70 a ton yesterday, according to data compiled by The Steel
Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
