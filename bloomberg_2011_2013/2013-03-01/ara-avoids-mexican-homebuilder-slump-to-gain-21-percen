Consorcio Ara SAB (ARA*) ,  Mexico ’s second-
biggest homebuilder by market value, had its largest weekly gain
in three years on speculation it will be able to avoid cash
constraints as the government scales back subsidies.  The stock surged 21 percent this week, the biggest jump
since May 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Today
the shares rose 5.1 percent to 5.20 pesos at 2:08 p.m. in Mexico
City trading. Ara’s weekly gain compared with a 6.9 percent gain
for the  Habita index , which tracks homebuilders in the country.  Last week, the Habita index plunged 12 percent as Fitch
Ratings said it may downgrade homebuilders including
 Desarrolladora Homex SAB (HOMEX*)  and  Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos SAB (URBI*)  amid
concern some properties might be unusable. While the industry as
a whole is not attractive, Ara is differentiated by its cash
flow and solid balance sheet, said Javier Gayol, an analyst with
Corporativo GBM SAB.  “If an investor is trying to play Mexican housing, the
best way to do so would be by Ara,” Gayol said in a telephone
interview. “Its balance sheet remains the strongest in the
sample and I think investors are recognizing that.”  Ara reported this week positive free cash flow of $171.7
million pesos in the fourth quarter, according to a  company
report .  Mexicali-based Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos SAB, by contrast,
said this week that cash holdings fell by 58 percent during the
fourth quarter to 2.47 billion pesos.  Ara has gained 26 percent this year, while the Habita index
has declined 18 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
