Copper and aluminum fell to three-
month lows on signals that manufacturing may sag in China, the
world’s biggest consumer of industrial metals.  Two gauges of Chinese manufacturing showed a pace of
expansion that was lower than analysts estimated, signaling the
nation’s economic recovery may be losing steam. Combined copper
inventories  monitored by exchanges in  Shanghai ,  London  and  New
York  have climbed to the highest since May 2010.  “The China numbers came in below expectations, and that
implies that manufacturing and copper demand in that country
aren’t going to be particularly robust for the next little
while,”  Bart Melek , the Toronto-based head of commodity
strategy at TD Securities, said in a telephone interview.
“Inventories in Europe and  Asia  are rising.”  Copper futures for May delivery dropped 1.3 percent to
settle at $3.501 a pound at 1:18 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Earlier, the price touched $3.4725, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Nov. 19.  On the London Metal Exchange, aluminum for delivery in
three months fell 1.5 percent to $1,975 a metric ton. Earlier,
the price touched $1,956, the lowest since Nov. 23. The metal
dropped for the 10th straight session, extending the longest
slump since June.  Copper on the LME fell 1.4 percent to $7,703 a ton ($3.49 a
pound). Lead, zinc and tin also dropped, while nickel rose.  In a report titled “Buying the Dip,” Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said today that copper will rebound as  China ’s imports pick
up and the U.S. housing market recovers. The price may rise to
$9,000 a ton in six months, the bank said.  Industrial metals and energy led commodities lower today.
