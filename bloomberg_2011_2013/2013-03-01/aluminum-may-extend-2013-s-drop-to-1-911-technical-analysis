Aluminum may drop to about $1,911 a
metric ton if it falls below an area consisting of the 200-day
moving average and a six-month uptrend, according to technical
analysis by Commerzbank AG.  The attached chart shows that the metal has fallen below
its 200-day moving average that is currently at about $2,001 and
a six-month uptrend line at about $1,984. A drop below that area
means prices may slide to an uptrend line drawn from 2009 to
2013 at about $1,911,  Karen Jones , a technical strategist at
Commerzbank in  London , said by phone yesterday.  “It will be pretty rapid,” she said, referring to a
possible drop to the $1,911 target within a week of falling
below the six-month trend line.  Aluminum for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange is down 3.8 percent this year and today fell to
$1,993.75 a ton, the lowest price since Nov. 28. Demand for the
metal, used in cars and beverage cans, will lag supply by 1.82
million tons this year, according to Barclays Plc.  Prices may “struggle” to rebound to the 55-day moving
average that’s at about $2,086, Jones said. The September high
of about $2,200 and the January peak of about $2,184 remain
“key” resistance levels, she said.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
