Acciona SA (ANA) , a Spanish renewables
and water developer, will cut energy investment in half and may
sell minority stakes to weather the fall-out from government
efforts to eliminate the nation’s power system tariff deficit.  “We believe it’s a major breach in investor confidence and
will have a massive impact” on earnings, Chairman Jose Manuel Entrecanales said today on a conference call with analysts.
“With the plan that we intend to put in place in terms of cost
reduction, it will be mitigated slightly.”  Acciona plans to reduce energy spending to a range of 550
million euros ($714 million) to 630 million euros this year and
next, a 50 percent cut to its previous investment plan. It will
also curb new developments to 345 to 395 megawatts and may sell
minority stakes to financial partners.  The Spanish developer also plans to target international
markets rather than rely on its home market, according to the
chairman.  Spain  has introduced measures including a 7 percent tax on
electricity generation to eliminate an annual tariff deficit,
the gap between costs and revenue in the power system. The
changes, including a levy on hydropower, will hurt Acciona’s
earnings before tax by about 160 million euros a year, the
Alcobendas-based company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
