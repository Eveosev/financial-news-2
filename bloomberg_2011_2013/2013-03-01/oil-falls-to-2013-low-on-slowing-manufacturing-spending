West Texas Intermediate oil slipped
to the lowest level this year as manufacturing expanded less
than forecast in  China  and contracted in  Europe , bolstering
concern that fuel demand will decline.  Futures fell 1.5 percent after data showed China’s
manufacturing growth slowed for a second month while factory
output declined in the euro area and the U.K. The factory data
helped the  U.S. dollar  strengthen against the British pound and
the euro. A stronger dollar curbs the appeal of raw materials to
investors.  “Oil is down because of the disappointing manufacturing
index data overnight, especially the Chinese number, which shows
the country had the smallest of expansions,” said  John Kilduff ,
a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that
focuses on energy. “U.K. manufacturing has plunged into
contraction, which is going to hurt demand.”  Crude oil for April delivery fell $1.37 to $90.68 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement since
Dec. 24. Prices dropped 2.6 percent this week. The volume of all
futures traded was down 1.5 percent from the 100-day average at
3:10 p.m.  Brent oil for April settlement dropped 98 cents, or 0.9
percent, to end the session at $110.40 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the lowest close since
Jan. 15. Volume was 52 percent above the 100-day average. The
European benchmark grade traded at a premium of $19.72 to WTI,
up from $19.33 yesterday.  Chinese Manufacturing  In China, the world’s biggest oil-consuming country after
the U.S., manufacturing slowed last month, the PMI report from
the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing in Beijing showed.
The reading fell to 50.1 last month from 50.4 in January.  A gauge of  U.K. manufacturing  based on a survey of
 purchasing managers  slid to 47.9 last month, according to Markit
Economics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply .
In the euro region, a  factory gauge  was unchanged in February at
47.9, marking a 19th month of contraction, according to a
separate Markit report today.  Futures rebounded from the day’s lows as U.S.  consumer
confidence  increased and a report showed that manufacturing grew
at the fastest pace since June 2011. The  Institute for Supply
Management  said its factory index rose to 54.2, the highest
reading since June 2011.  Dollar Rally  The economic data helped the dollar climb to the highest
level against the euro in almost three months after Italian
elections this week delivered a four-way parliamentary split.
The U.S. currency also rose above $1.50 against the pound for
the first time since July 2010.  “We’re seeing a lot of flight into the dollar since the
Italian election,” Kilduff said. “The pound broke through
$1.50 today, which is a very important level.”  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities fell as
much as 1.3 percent to 640.03, the lowest level since Dec. 31.  Oil also slipped as a Bloomberg survey of analysts showed
output by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries climbed. Libyan daily production increased by 130,000
barrels to 1.24 million last month, the biggest gain of any
member, after the reopening of the country’s Zueitina export
terminal early in February.  Saudi Production  Saudi Arabia , OPEC’s biggest producer, pumped 9 million
barrels a day, the least since May 2011, according to the
survey. Output was down 100,000 barrels from January and 900,000
barrels from May, when production reached the highest since at
least January 1989.  “We’re seeing oil be more conservatively priced, but we
still aren’t at fair value,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst
at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “The fundamentals
support a price in the $80-to-$85 area.”  U.S. crude inventories increased 1.13 million barrels to
377.5 million last week, the highest level since July, a Feb. 27
Energy Information Administration report showed. Output climbed
to 7.12 million barrels a day in the week ended Feb. 15, the
most since August 1992.  “The fundamentals didn’t justify the high level of  oil
prices ,” said Julius Walker, global energy markets strategist
at UBS Securities LLC in New York. “The fundamentals are
reasserting themselves.”  Net-long positions in West Texas Intermediate oil held by
money managers, or wagers on rising prices, climbed to 221,534
in the week ended Feb. 15, the highest level since March 2012,
according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s
Commitments of Traders report.  “One has to remember that there was an awful lot of length
in the market,” Evans said. “We’re seeing massive reversal
now, which is putting pressure on futures.”  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 463,360
contracts as of 3:11 p.m. It totaled 455,826 contracts
yesterday, 14 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.66 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
