Azerbaijan’s State Oil Fund, which
started investing in gold last year, bought 17.4 metric tons of
bullion as of March 1 as the third-largest oil producer in the
former Soviet Union diversifies reserves.  Sofaz, as the fund is known, has delivered about 3 tons of
gold into the Azeri capital, the Baku-based fund said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Founded in 1999 to manage the Caspian Sea nation’s income
from the sale of oil and natural gas, Sofaz plans to increase
its gold reserves to 30 tons by year-end, the fund’s Executive
Director Shahmar Movsumov told state TV channel AzTV last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
