Canadian Natural Resources Minister
Joe Oliver said  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Keystone XL pipeline would
give the U.S. a more stable supply of energy and didn’t comment
on whether it would be approved.  “This project will replace oil from Venezuela and the
Middle East with a stable continental supply, including from the
 oil sands  and improve the energy security of North America,”
Oliver told reporters in Toronto today. Keystone would also
“create tens of thousands of jobs on both sides of the
border,” he said.  The U.S. State Department today reported on the pipeline
and made no specific recommendation on the project, which was
modified after President  Barack Obama  blocked the original path
on concern it posed a threat to a Nebraska aquifer.   To contact the reporter on this story:
