H.J. Heinz (HNZ)  set the rate on a $2.1
billion portion of the $14.1 billion financing backing the
ketchup maker’s buyout by  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. and 3G Capital, according to three people with knowledge of
the deal.  The bridge loan will pay interest at 400 basis points more
than the London interbank offered rate, said the people who
asked not to be identified because the information is private.
The lending benchmark will have a floor of one percent, said the
people.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co., the banks
arranging the financing, were seeking lender commitments by noon
today, the people said.  Bridge facilities are short-term loans and are often used
as backstops to bond offerings or longer-dated bank debt.
Heinz’s bridge will be replaced in about three weeks, the people
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
