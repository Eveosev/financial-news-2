The yen may revisit the lowest level
since May 2010 reached earlier this week if a key so-called
support level fails to hold, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Japanese currency will face a test at 93.84 per dollar,
according to Niall O’Connor, a technical analyst at JPMorgan in
 New York . The yen may depreciate to 94.77, the almost three-year
low it reached on Feb. 25, if it breaches that support level,
O’Connor said. The currency gained 1.7 percent on Feb. 25, its
biggest advance since March 2011.  “On a medium-term scale, there’s not enough right now to
suggest that the overall uptrend in dollar-yen is over,”
O’Connor said in a telephone interview.  The yen declined 1.1 percent to 93.57 per dollar at 1:19
p.m. in New York after reaching 93.68. The currency slid 0.9
percent to 121.90 per euro.  Japan ’s currency may strengthen to 88.77, its highest level
in five weeks, if it breaks a key level of resistance at 90.25,
according to O’Connor.  The yen strengthened 0.9 percent over the past week among
the 10 developed-nation currencies monitored by the Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar gained 1 percent, while
 Norway ’s krone dropped 0.6 percent and the euro fell 0.4
percent.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index. Resistance refers to an area on a chart where
sell orders may be gathered, and support is an area where there
may be buy orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
