Nordic electricity for April traded
close to the highest in six weeks after weather forecasters
maintained temperature and precipitation predictions for the
coming weeks.  The April contract closed at 38.80 euros ($50.42) a
megawatt-hour after rising to 39 euros on Nasdaq OMX Group
Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo. The benchmark Nordic next-
quarter contract was unchanged at 37.10 euros. Today’s intraday
highs for both contracts matched those for yesterday and were
the most since Jan. 18.  “ Weather forecasts  are mixed, offering no firm signals to
trade on, resulting in small price adjustments of 5 to 20 euro
cents,” Svein Nyland, head of analysis at SKM Market Predictor,
said by phone from Trondheim,  Norway .  Temperatures in  Sweden  may average minus 0.2 degrees
Celsius (31 Fahrenheit) through March 11, compared with an
earlier forecast of minus 0.1, MetraWeather data on Bloomberg
using the ECMWF model show.  The Nordic region gets more than half of its power from
hydroelectric plants. The amount of water and snow available to
generate electricity in the region may be 15.3 terawatt-hours
below normal for the time of year in two weeks, up from 15.9
terawatt-hours today, Markedskraft data on Bloomberg show.
Wetter weather signals more supply and points to lower prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
