Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
renewed its bid to draw Bruno Iksil, known as the “London Whale”
trader, into an $8.6 billion fight with  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   The defunct investment bank filed a revised request
yesterday to a federal judge in  Manhattan , seeking permission to
ask for international judicial assistance to force Iksil, a
French national, to answer questions, as he is unwilling to do
so.  Among the supporting documents for its request, Lehman
attached e-mails from JPMorgan’s collateral operations group
about a dispute over three derivatives trades in 2008, shortly
before Lehman collapsed in bankruptcy. Two of the transactions
listed Luis Buraya as the trader, together with Iksil.  Other documents in the case show Iksil saying, when asked
about the trades, “I do not know. This is not me,” before
referring Lehman to Buraya.  JPMorgan, a key lender to Lehman during the 2008 credit
crisis, said this week the derivatives margin that Lehman
currently wanted to query Iksil about -- which was resolved at
the time by returning disputed margin to Lehman -- wasn’t
related to the collateral at issue in the lawsuit.  Lehman’s inquiry concerned fewer than a dozen derivatives
trades, out of 70,000 such trades between the bank and its
client, and would add nothing to the “millions of pages of
documents and eighty depositions of current and former JPMorgan
personnel” obtained by Lehman in the past two years, JPMorgan
said in filings in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
