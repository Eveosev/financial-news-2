Brazil ’s swap rates fell, extending
their weekly drop to the biggest this year, as fourth-quarter
economic growth trailed forecasts, damping speculation that the
central bank will raise borrowing costs to curb inflation.  Swap rates on the contracts due in April 2014 declined four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.76 percent at 10
a.m. in Sao Paulo. They have dropped 23 basis points this week,
the most since the five days ended Dec. 7. The real depreciated
0.2 percent to 1.9829 per  U.S. dollar  and has weakened 0.5
percent since Feb. 22.  “The weaker GDP growth reinforces the idea that the
economy is having a weak recovery and removes the urgency of
rate hikes,”  Jankiel Santos , the chief economist at Banco
Espirito Santo de Investimento SA in Sao Paulo, said in a
telephone interview.  Brazil’s gross domestic product grew 0.6 percent in the
fourth quarter, compared with revised 0.4 percent increase in
the prior three months, the national statistics agency reported
today. The median forecast of 37 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for growth of 0.8 percent.  The central bank will decide next week whether to hold the
target lending  rate  at a record low 7.25 percent for a third
straight meeting to support the economy even as inflation has
exceeded the 4.5 percent midpoint of its preferred range for
more than two years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
