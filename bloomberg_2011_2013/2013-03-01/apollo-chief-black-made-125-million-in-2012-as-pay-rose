Leon Black , co-founder and chief
executive officer of  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) , received
$125.5 million in compensation and cash dividends last year as
his payout climbed from $77.3 million a year earlier.  Black, 61, was paid a $100,000 salary and $187,368 in other
compensation, including reimbursement for the cost of Black’s
car, driver and tickets to sporting events, the New York-based
company said today in a  filing  with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. He received $125.2 million in cash
dividends from his ownership of Apollo stock.  The private-equity firm isn’t required by the New York
Stock Exchange, where its shares are listed, to have a
compensation committee because Apollo is considered a limited
partnership. As a result, executive compensation decisions are
left to Black, who is chairman of the company’s board of
directors, and co-founders  Joshua Harris  and Marc Rowan.  Apollo’s economic net income after taxes, a measure of
profit excluding some costs tied to its 2011 initial public
offering, was $1.5 billion in 2012, compared with a loss of $322
million the previous year, the company said last month. The
increase was driven by the sale of Apollo-owned assets and
strong performance by several of the firm’s largest holdings,
including  LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB)  and  Metals USA Holdings
Corp. (MUSA)   ‘Good Time’  “Given the nature of our portfolio, when it was invested
and how these companies are doing, we believe that we were ripe
for monetizations,” Marc Spilker, Apollo’s president, said last
month on a conference call discussing the firm’s earnings. “As
long as the window stays open, it feels like a good time for us
to monetize.”  Apollo’s private-equity funds have made money for
investors, generating a 25 percent net internal rate of return
across pools as of Dec. 31, according to Apollo’s most recent
earnings report. Its latest flagship buyout fund, which started
investing in 2008 with $14.7 billion, was producing a 26 percent
net IRR, with its value standing at $23.1 billion.  Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts , KKR & Co.’s co-founders
and co-CEOs, took home more than $137 million each in 2012,
their firm said last week in a regulatory filing, as its profit
last year more than quadrupled to $2 billion from 2011. Roberts
got $140.8 million and Kravis received $137.2 million, each
including about $35 million of carried interest.  Stephen Schwarzman , chairman and CEO of  Blackstone Group
LP (BX) , earned $213.3 million in pay and cash dividends last year,
almost matching his payout of $213.5 million the previous year,
Blackstone said today. Schwarzman, 66, received the bulk of his
payout in the form of stock dividends, which netted the
Blackstone co-founder $204 million.  Black is worth an estimated $6.9 billion, according to the
Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Schwarzman has a net worth of $7
billion, and Kravis and Roberts are worth $4.6 billion and $4.5
billion, respectively, according to the index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
