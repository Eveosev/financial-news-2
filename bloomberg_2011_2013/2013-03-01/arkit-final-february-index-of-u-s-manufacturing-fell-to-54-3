The Markit Economics  final index  of
U.S. manufacturing decreased to 54.3 in February from 55.8 a
month earlier, the London-based group said today.  A reading above 50 for the purchasing managers’ measure
indicates expansion. The preliminary reading was 55.2.  Markit’s purchasers figure is based on responses from about
85 percent to 90 percent of companies in a poll of more than 600
American manufacturers.  The Markit gauge of U.S. manufacturing debuted in May 2012.
The company surveys purchasing managers in more than 30
countries and regions, including Europe and  China .  Chinese manufacturing cooled in February, according to a
gauge from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit. The index fell to a
four-month low of 50.4 from a January reading of 52.3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
