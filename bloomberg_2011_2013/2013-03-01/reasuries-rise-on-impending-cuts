Treasuries rose for a second day,
with 10-year yields having the biggest weekly drop since August,
as $85 billion of spending cuts that threatened to slow the
world’s largest economy were set to be triggered.  Benchmark  10-year notes  extended gains from February as
President  Barack Obama  said after meeting with congressional
leaders that the reductions will be a “slow grind” on the
economy. Treasuries had pared an advance earlier after a gauge
of U.S. manufacturing rose to the  highest  since June 2011.
Investors sought safety as Chinese factory growth slowed, the
euro-area inflation rate dropped and Italian bonds fell.  “There’s a lot of paralysis going on in D.C.,” said
 George Goncalves , head of interest-rate strategy at Nomura
Holdings Inc., one of 21 primary dealers that trade Treasuries
with the Federal Reserve. “It’s not clear yet on how it’s going
to go, so people are buying Treasuries first and asking
questions later.”  The 10-year  yield  decreased three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.84 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It lost 12 basis
points for the week, the biggest drop since Aug. 31. The 2
percent note due in February 2023 gained 10/32, or $3.13 per
$1,000 face amount, to 101 14/32. Thirty-year bond yields sank
four basis points to 3.05 percent.  Net Long  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators  increased 
to the highest this year their net-long position in 10-year note
futures in the week ending Feb. 26, according to U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data.  Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 115,908 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the most since Dec. 14. Net-long positions rose
by 62,620 contracts, or 118 percent, from a week earlier, the
biggest percentage gain since Jan. 25, the Washington-based
commission said in its Commitments of Traders report.  Ten-year yields slid 11 basis points in February, their
first drop in three months and the largest since July. They will
be at 1.83 percent on March 31 before rising to 2.28 percent by
year-end, according to a Bloomberg survey of financial companies
with the most recent projections given the heaviest weightings.  Treasuries trimmed gains after the Institute for Supply
Management’s factory index advanced to 54.2 last month, from
53.1 in January, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said today. The
figures exceeded the most optimistic forecast in a Bloomberg
survey in which the median projection was 52.5. A reading
greater than 50 signals expansion.  Spending, Income  Commerce Department data showed earlier that consumer
spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the U.S.
economy, rose 0.2 percent in January, matching the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Incomes slumped 3.6 percent.  U.S. government debt rallied this week after an
inconclusive Italian election and as Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke backed the central bank’s bond purchases.  The 10-year term premium, a model that includes
expectations for interest rates, growth and inflation, reached
negative 0.75 percent today, the most costly level since Jan.
23. A negative reading indicates investors are willing to accept
yields below what’s considered fair value.  Treasury trading  volume  dropped to $239 billion today, the
lowest level since Feb. 22, according to ICAP Plc, the largest
inter-dealer broker of U.S. government debt. Daily volume
reached $491 billion on Feb. 1, the highest since August 2011.
The average daily volume for 2013 is $300 billion, compared with
$238 billion in 2012.  Spending Cuts  Congress mandated $1.2 trillion in across-the-board
spending cuts to begin today and be spread over nine years, as
part of a 2011 agreement to increase the U.S. debt limit.
Reductions totaling $85 billion are scheduled to take effect in
the remaining seven months of this fiscal year. Lawmakers have
failed to reach an accord to head them off.  “No one knows how much time we have in terms of the
resolution of this,” said Sean Murphy, a trader at the primary
dealer Societe Generale in New York. “We have the potential to
grind higher in prices with these concerns. There may be another
10 basis points of steam left.”  Obama said it may take weeks to win over enough lawmakers
from both parties to reach a deal on a replacement deficit-
cutting plan. He said agreement will be reached once members of
Congress hear from voters feeling the pinch of cutbacks in
government programs.  Fed Buying  Bernanke signaled in congressional testimony this week the
Fed is prepared to keep buying bonds at its present pace, as he
dismissed concern that record easing risks sparking inflation or
asset-price bubbles. The central bank purchases $85 billion of
Treasury and mortgage debt a month, putting downward pressure on
borrowing costs to fuel growth.  The Fed bought $916 million of Treasuries today maturing
from August 2023 to February 2031.  China’s official purchasing managers’ index was 50.1 in
February, the weakest in five months and down from 50.4 in
January, a report from the  National Bureau of Statistics  and
China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing showed in Beijing.
The euro area’s annual inflation rate fell more than economists
predicted in February, to 1.8 percent, according to the European
Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg.  Italy’s 10-year yield rose six basis points to 4.79 percent
today. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index fell as much as 0.9
percent and gained as much as 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
