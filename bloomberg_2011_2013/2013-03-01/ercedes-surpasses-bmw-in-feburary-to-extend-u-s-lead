Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz reported
a 22 percent surge in U.S. sales last month, building on its
early lead as it tries to unseat  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s
BMW as the leader in luxury-auto deliveries this year.  Mercedes said yesterday it delivered 22,040 vehicles last
month, its best February, helped by sales of the C-Class sedan,
which rose 39 percent to 7,302. BMW-brand sales increased 0.5
percent to 21,311 vehicles, boosted by a 22 percent gain for its
X5 sport-utility vehicle.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s  Lexus  rose 3.9
percent to 17,339, led by the RX SUV, which gained 20 percent to
6,938 deliveries.  The two German automakers are vying to be the top luxury-
auto brand in the U.S. after outselling Lexus the past two
years. BMW vaulted to its second consecutive U.S. luxury crown
with a December surge, based on reported sales. When measured by
vehicle registrations, Mercedes topped BMW, according to
researcher R.L. Polk & Co.  “We’re just carrying the momentum that we brought from
last year into this year,”  Steve Cannon , chief executive
officer of Mercedes-Benz USA, said in an interview yesterday.
“We haven’t even gotten to any of our new products yet.”  For the first two months, sales of Mercedes vehicles gained
16 percent to 44,541. Munich-based BMW’s 2013 deliveries have
increased 0.6 percent to 37,824. Lexus rose 16 percent to
33,550.  The sales results don’t include Stuttgart, Germany-based
Daimler’s cargo vans and Smart cars and BMW’s Mini brand, which
aren’t luxury vehicles. Lexus was the top-selling luxury brand
in the U.S. for 11 years until natural disasters in Asia
curtailed production in 2011.  Super Bowl  Mercedes benefited from an almost 2-minute commercial that
aired during the  Super Bowl  last month, introducing the CLA
sedan, which will go on sale in September at $29,900. The spot,
with model Kate Upton, singer Usher and actor Willem Dafoe,
boosted online shopping activity for the brand and the C-Class,
Cannon said.  “CLA really is kind of a halo car from underneath that I
think recalibrated people’s price-value perception of the
Mercedes-Benz brand,” Cannon said.  Mercedes-Benz incentive spending rose 19 percent to $4,218
per vehicle, compared with a 4.5 percent increase to $3,512 for
BMW, according to Santa Monica, California-based TrueCar Inc.  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Cadillac rose 20 percent to 13,845
vehicles in February, helped by a pair of new sedans, the XTS
and the ATS, according to a statement from the Detroit-based
company.  Audi, Infiniti  U.S. sales of Wolfsburg, Germany-based  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi
brand rose 27 percent to 10,877, the company said in a
statement. It was the brand’s 26th straight month of record
sales, which included a 14 percent jump for the A4 sedan to
3,089.  Sales of Tokyo-based  Honda Motor Co. (7267) ’s Acura brand rose 0.9
percent to 11,364 last month, the company said in a statement.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ’s Infiniti sold 9,147 vehicles, a 1
percent decline from a year earlier, the Yokohama, Japan-based
automaker said in a statement yesterday.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  sold 4,883 Lincolns in February, a 29
percent decrease from a year earlier, according to a statement
from the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker. Ford is starting a
new ad campaign to try to revive the luxury brand, including
airing spots during last month’s Super Bowl.  The decline was because of a shortage of redesigned MKZ
sedans at dealerships. Ford said Lincoln dealers should be fully
stocked by the beginning of April. Ford sold 945 MKZs last
month, a 62 percent drop from a year earlier. Ford has started
delivering 100 vehicles a day to dealers,  Ken Czubay , Ford’s
U.S. sales chief, said on a conference call yesterday.  Porsche, the Stuttgart-based automaker that is now part of
Volkswagen, reported in a statement that it sold 2,805 vehicles
in the U.S. last month, a 31 percent gain.  Land Rover sales rose 20 percent to 3,905, while Jaguar’s
gained 12 percent to 1,148, according to an e-mailed statement.
