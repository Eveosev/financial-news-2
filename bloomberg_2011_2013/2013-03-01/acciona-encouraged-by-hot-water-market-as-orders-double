Acciona SA (ANA) , a Spanish renewable
energy company, said contracts at its water management
subsidiary more than doubled in 2012.  Acciona Agua SA, which treats enough water for six million
people a day, said its order book grew by 137 percent to 11.3
billion euros ($14.7 billion) last year while orders at units
such as construction rose by 4 percent. Acciona’s 2012 earnings
fell 6.3 percent to 189.4 million euros from a year earlier.  “Water is a very hot market,” Chairman Jose Manuel Entrecanales said today in a conference call with analysts.
“Water is probably the infrastructure that is going to be most
demanded in the next decade.”  Based in the Madrid suburb of Alcobendas, Acciona Agua
acquired a concession to privatize Barcelona’s water supply last
year, which is currently pending court resolution to annul the
contract by the Catalan government. Its water, desalination and
wastewater works include plants in Saudi Arabia,  Peru ,  Italy ,
 Morocco  and the United Arab Emirates. Acciona Agua results
represented 3.8 percent of Acciona’s earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
