China Life Insurance Co. (601628)  led
insurance stocks lower after the company estimated slumping
profit. Consumer-staples producers paced gains for companies
more immune to an economic slowdown after manufacturing reports
trailed estimates.  China Life, the nation’s biggest insurer, dropped the most
in a week after after saying full-year profit probably slumped
40 percent. A government report showed China’s manufacturing
Purchasing Managers’ Index was 50.1 in February，compared with
the median economists’ estimate of 50.5.  “The PMI may not tell too much about the economy as the
data may be skewed by the Chinese new year factor in February,”
said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based fund manager at Dazhong Insurance
Co., which oversees $285 million. “Combining data for January
and February would be better to gauge the true picture of the
economy and stocks would move on that.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slipped 0.3 percent to
2,358.47 at 10:03 a.m. local time, after jumping 2.3 percent
yesterday in the biggest advance in a month. The CSI 300 Index
lost 0.3 percent to 2,665.93. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in  Hong Kong  fell 0.2 percent.
The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded
U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added 0.2 percent in New York
yesterday.  The Shanghai Composite has gained 1.9 percent this week,
adding to a 20 percent climb since a bull-market rally started
on Dec. 3. The measure declined 0.8 percent in February, the
first monthly drop since November, and  trades  for 9.8 times
projected 12-month earnings, near the lowest since Dec. 24.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
