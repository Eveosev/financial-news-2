Boeing Co. (BA)  is cutting some
contractor jobs in North Charleston, South Carolina, where it
employs about 6,000 workers to build the 787 Dreamliner.  “As this site improves efficiencies, employees are trained
and the experience grows, you reduce your reliance on contract
labor,” said  Marc Birtel , a spokesman at the company’s
commercial headquarters in  Seattle . “This has been part of this
site’s long-term plan.”  Boeing continues to make five 787 jets a month even as
deliveries were halted after the model was grounded by
regulators Jan. 16. U.S. and Japanese officials are
investigating battery faults on two 787s last month that led to
a fire and an emergency landing.  “It has nothing to do with the grounding,” Birtel said,
referring to the reductions. “We’re not reducing production.”  Birtel declined to say how many contractors would lose
their jobs. Boeing employs about 174,000 people worldwide and
makes the 787 at the North Charleston factory, which opened in
2011, and at its main plant in Everett,  Washington .  The job cuts were reported earlier today by the Wall Street
Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
