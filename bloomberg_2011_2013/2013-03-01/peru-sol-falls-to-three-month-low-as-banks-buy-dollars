Peru’s sol fell to its weakest level
in three months as banks boosted dollar purchases to meet
increased  reserve requirements .  The sol depreciated 0.3 percent to 2.5962 per  U.S. dollar 
at 12:05 p.m. in  Lima , the lowest since Nov. 21, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg. The currency was headed for a 0.6
percent weekly decline.  Banco Central de Reserva del Peru on Feb. 27 raised dollar
reserve requirements for a third time this year to slow credit
expansion and weaken the sol. The increases, combined with the
central bank’s $3.4 billion of U.S. currency purchases this
year, are making lenders reluctant to bet against the greenback,
said Antonio Diaz, a trader at Banco Internacional del Peru.  “We know the central bank is there with measures, that
it’s in the market when it has to be,” Diaz said in a phone
interview from Lima. “The ‘sell, sell, sell’ strategy has
changed. Things are more balanced.”  The  Finance Ministry  has pledged to buy at least $4 billion
this year to curb gains in the sol, which appreciated 5.7
percent in 2012, the fastest pace since 2009. Today’s fall
extends the local currency’s drop this year to 1.7 percent.  Copper, Peru’s top export, fell after manufacturing growth
slowed in  China , the world’s biggest industrial metals user.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 3.73 percent, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The price increased 0.22 centimo to
126.32 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
