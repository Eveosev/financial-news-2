Bank of America Corp. , the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, is under investigation by the  New
York  Attorney General’s Office over the bundling of  mortgage
loans  into securities.  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who sued
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  last year over losses on mortgage bonds, is
probing the purchase, securitization and underwriting of home
loans and mortgage securities, the bank said yesterday in a
 regulatory filing .  The bank, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, said it
“continues to cooperate fully” with the investigation. The
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating
practices by the bank’s Merrill Lynch unit related to
collateralized debt obligations, including valuation and
marketing, according to the filing.  Schneiderman is the co-chairman of a state and federal
group established last year to investigate misconduct in the
mortgage-securities market. The group includes the U.S. Justice
Department and the SEC.  New York sued JPMorgan in October, claiming Bear Stearns,
the investment bank acquired by JPMorgan, defrauded investors.
Schneiderman, who also sued  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , said the
JPMorgan case would be a template for other actions against
banks.  James Freedland, a spokesman for Schneiderman, declined to
comment on the bank’s filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
