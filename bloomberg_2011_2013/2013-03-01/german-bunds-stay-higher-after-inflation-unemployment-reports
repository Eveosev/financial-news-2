German government bonds stayed
higher after reports showed euro-area inflation slowed last
month and unemployment rose in January.  The 10-year yield slipped two basis points to 1.43 percent
at 10:04 a.m. London time. Two-year note yields were little
changed at 0.04 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
