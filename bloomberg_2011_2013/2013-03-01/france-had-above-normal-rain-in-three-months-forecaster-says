France , Europeâ€™s largest wheat
grower, had cloudy conditions and 15 percent more rainfall than
normal in the past three months, Meteo France said.  Southwest  France  and central areas between Auvergne and
Burgundy were the wettest from December through February, while
conditions were drier in the  southeast , the forecaster said
today in a report on its website.  Temperatures  were below
normal, on average, especially in eastern areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
