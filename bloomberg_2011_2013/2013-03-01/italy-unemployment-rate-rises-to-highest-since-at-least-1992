Italy ’s joblessness rose to the
highest level since at least 1992 in January as businesses
refrained from hiring after the country’s recession deepened.  The  unemployment rate  rose to 11.7 percent from a revised
11.3 percent in December, the Rome-based national statistics
office Istat said in a preliminary report today. The January
rate was higher than the 11.3 percent  median  of six estimates in
a Bloomberg News survey. Unemployment remained above 10 percent
for a 12th month.  Italy’s economy shrank 1 percent in the fourth quarter as
the recession deepened more than forecast amid a fall in
consumer spending and investments by companies. Rising exports
may help the euro region’s third-biggest economy return to
growth in the second half, both the Bank of Italy and the
government led by outgoing Prime Minister Mario Monti said.
Still,  confidence  among households and businesses may fall in
coming months after last month’s elections led to a hung
Parliament.  The unemployment rate for people between the age of 15 and
24 rose to 38.7 percent in January, Istat said today. Istat
originally reported an unemployment rate of 11.2 percent in
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
