DAB Bank AG (DRN) , the German online
broker controlled by Italy’s  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , said second-quarter
profit declined 39 percent on lower financial income.  Net income fell to 4.23 million euros ($6.1 million), or
six cents a share, from 6.91 million euros, or nine cents, a
year earlier, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.
DAB Bank expects to match last year’s pretax profit of 28.57
million euros this year, it said.  Munich-based DAB Bank, which competes with Internet brokers
such as Comdirect Bank AG, last week appointed Markus Gunter,
44, as chief executive officer. It also  announced  that Niklas
Dieterich, 42, will replace Markus Walch on the management board
and take the post of chief financial officer on Sept. 1.  DAB Bank’s number of transactions in the quarter decreased
to 1.1 million from 1.2 million a year earlier. Commission
income fell 6.6 percent to 20.4 million euros, while financial
income, which includes net interest income, earnings from
trading and investment income, dropped 10 percent to 14.5
million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
