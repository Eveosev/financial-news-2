Russia , the world’s largest oil
producer, plans to export 11 cargoes of East Siberian Pacific
Ocean pipeline, or ESPO, crude between Sept. 4 and Oct. 1,
according to loading schedules obtained by Bloomberg News.  Exporters typically load East Siberian oil cargoes of
100,000 metric tons, or about 730,000 barrels, each for sale
from the port of Kozmino in Russia’s  Far East  near the city of
Nakhodka.  OAO Surgutneftegas is offering three cargoes of ESPO for
loading from Sept. 4-7, Sept. 9-13 and Sept. 17-21 as part of
the 11 shipments, said two traders who participate in the
market. The offers are due tomorrow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
