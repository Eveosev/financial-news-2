Societe Television Francaise 1 (TFI) , the
owner of  France ’s most-watched TV channel, repeated its forecast
for “flat” full-year revenue even as first-half profit
climbed.  First-half net income rose 60 percent to 118.6 million
euros ($171.9 million) from 74.2 million euros a year earlier,
TF1 said in an e-mailed statement. Sales in the first six months
of the year were just under 1.3 billion euros.  TF1 and other traditional broadcasters are looking to guard
market share and strengthen content offerings as French
consumers migrate toward online television services and premium
pay-TV. The Boulogne-Billancourt, France-based company this
month announced a distribution deal with Sony Pictures for
access to the studio’s films and series.  The company is operating in “an economic environment still
characterized by weak visibility,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
