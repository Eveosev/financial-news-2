Mumias Sugar Co.,  Kenya ’s biggest
producer of the sweetener, headed for the lowest close in almost
a week on speculation it will lose revenue after the company
failed to generate power for sale to the national grid.  The stock retreated as much as 2.1 percent to 7.05
shillings before trading 1.4 percent lower at 7.10 shillings as
of 2:16 p.m. in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital. A close at this
level would be the weakest since July 21.  Kenya Power Ltd., the East African nation’s sole
electricity distributor, said yesterday it would begin scheduled
power cuts tomorrow due to power-supply shortages caused by the
“unavailability” of 26 megawatts from Mumias Sugar’s co-
generation plant.  “They do not have enough bagasse,” or the cane fiber used
to generate power, Wycliffe Masinde, an analyst at Nairobi-based
Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview
today. “They earn over 700 million shillings ($7.73 million)
annually when the power generation is operating at full
capacity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
