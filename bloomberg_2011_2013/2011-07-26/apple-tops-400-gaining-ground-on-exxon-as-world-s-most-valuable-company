Apple Inc. (AAPL) , a week after reporting
record sales and profit, surpassed $400 a share for the first
time and is gaining ground on  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  to become the
world’s most valuable company.  The shares rose $4.91 to $403.41 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading. Apple has climbed 25 percent this year and 7 percent
since the company reported third-quarter results on July 19.  Apple, on the brink of bankruptcy when Chief Executive
Officer Steve Jobs reclaimed the top job more than a decade ago,
now has a bigger market value than  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and  Intel
Corp. (INTC)  combined, fueled by new products such as the iPhone and
iPad. Shares are up from a stock-adjusted $5.48 on Sept. 16,
1997, the day Jobs returned after his 1985 ouster.  “It started with the Mac, then iPods, iPhones and now the
iPad,” said Giri Cherukuri, head trader for Oakbrook
Investments, which manages $2.7 billion, including Apple shares.
“It’s incredible.”  The stock price gives Cupertino, California-based Apple a
market capitalization of about $374 billion, trailing by $41.6
billion the $416 billion value of Irving, Texas-based Exxon.  Apple’s iPhone-fueled rise comes amid a reversal of
fortunes for rival makers of smartphones such as  Research In
Motion Ltd. (RIMM)  and Nokia Oyj, which have lost market share and
fired workers. Yesterday, RIM announced plans to cut 2,000 jobs
amid slowing sales. In April, Nokia said it would eliminate
7,000 jobs.  Apple last week said profit more than doubled to $7.31
billion on revenue of $28.6 billion, compared with the same
period a year earlier. The company had record sales of iPhones
and iPads, products that didn’t exist five years ago and now
account for more than 70 percent of revenue. Apple also has
accumulated $76.2 billion in cash and other holdings.  “I don’t see too much slowing them down,” Cherukuri said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
