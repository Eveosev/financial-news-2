Hungarian retail sales rose the most
in eight months in May, a sign domestic demand may add to the
economy’s export-led emergence from its worst slump in 18 years.  Sales rose 0.7 percent from the year-earlier period, the
most since September 2010, after dropping a revised 1.2 percent
in April, the  statistics office  in Budapest said today in an e-
mailed statement. The median estimate of 10 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg was a 0.4 percent drop.  Retail sales declined for 41 consecutive months through
June 2010 as five years of austerity curtailed domestic demand.
Rising exports helped  Hungary ’s economy grow 2.5 percent in the
first quarter from the same period last year, the fastest pace
in four years. The government targets growth of 3.2 percent this
year and as much as 5.2 percent by 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
