The dollar may climb from a record
low against the  Swiss franc  as the U.S. currency’s recent
decline has been too rapid, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
said, citing a technical indicator.  The greenback’s 14-day relative strength index, or RSI,
against the franc fell to 30, matching the level that some
traders see as a sign that an asset has declined too quickly and
is poised to reverse course. The dollar was about 6 percent from
a lower range of the so-called cloud on its ichimoku chart.  “The dollar appears to be oversold. With the RSI set to
break 30, there seems to be a chance of a rebound for the short
term,” said Teppei Ino, an analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ, a unit of  Japan ’s largest listed bank by market value. “To
say with confidence that the trend is turning around, the dollar
should reach the cloud” on its ichimoku chart, he said.  The dollar slumped to an all-time low of 80.10 centimes
today before trading at 80.26 centimes as of 11:34 a.m. in Tokyo.  Ichimoku charts are used to predict a currency’s direction
by analyzing the midpoints of historical highs and lows. The
cloud refers to the area between the first and second leading-
span lines on the chart and is used to show an area where buy
orders may be clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
