Saudi Arabia , the world’s largest
crude exporter, posted a 3.4 percent drop in petrochemicals
shipments in May, according to the  Saudi Ports Authority .  Companies including  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC)  exported
2.59 million metric tons of the products in May compared with
2.68 million tons a year earlier, the port authority said today
on its website. That is 2.6 percent less than April when the
country shipped 2.66 million tons, the data showed.  Saudi Arabia reported an increase in petrochemical exports
this year on rising demand from Asia, mainly China and
Singapore, the country’s two largest importers. The kingdom
shipped 12.6 million tons from January through May compared with
11.8 million tons in the year-earlier period, according to the
port authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
