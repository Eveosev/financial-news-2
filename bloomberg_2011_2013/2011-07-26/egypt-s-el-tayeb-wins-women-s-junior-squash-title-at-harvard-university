Nour El Tayeb of  Egypt  won the
Women’s  World Junior Squash Championship  at  Harvard University 
by beating countrywoman Nour El Sherbini.  El Tayeb, 18, avenged her loss to El Sherbini in the 2009
world championship final with a 11/5, 3/11, 11/7, 11/8 victory
last night. The team competition begins today, with two-time
defending champion Egypt as the No. 1 seed.  The tournament was to be staged in Egypt before being moved
in March because of political unrest.  Harvard may get a recruiting boost from hosting the
tournament after the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based school won
the women’s national college title in 2010 and finished as
runner-up to  Yale University  this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
