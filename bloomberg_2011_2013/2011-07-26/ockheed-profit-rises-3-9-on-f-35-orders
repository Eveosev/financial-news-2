Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the world’s
largest defense company, boosted its full-year profit estimate
as second-quarter profit rose 3.9 percent, aided by higher sales
and profits from orders for the  F-35 Joint Strike Fighter .  Lockheed rose as much as 3 percent in  New York  trading
before closing $80.82, a 1.9 percent gain, after the company
raised full-year profit estimates. For 2011, earnings per share
will be in the range of $7.35 to $7.55 -- an increase from the
earlier projection of $6.95 to $7.25 a share made in April,
Lockheed said. Sales will be between $46 billion and $47
billion, it said. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast profit
of $7.26 a share on sales of $46.7 billion.  Chief Executive Officer  Robert Stevens  has cut 3,850 jobs
since last year to match the projected decline in U.S. defense
spending. Last week, Lockheed offered voluntary  retirement plans 
to an additional 6,500 employees.  Lockheed is “implementing difficult measures to right-size
our business for an environment that remains challenging,”
Stevens said today in a statement released by the Bethesda,
Maryland-based company.  Profit from continuing operations increased to $742
million, or $2.14 a share, from $714 million, or $1.92, a year
earlier, Lockheed said. That beat the $1.94 average estimate of
21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales increased 2.4 percent
to $11.6 billion.  ‘Need to Right-Size’  “We always evaluate the need to right-size the business,”
Bruce Tanner, Lockheed’s chief financial officer, said in a
telephone interview when asked if the company may seek more
reductions in the future. “That’s a function of the environment
around us.”  President  Barack Obama  on April 13 announced $400 billion
of cuts in national security spending through 2023, in addition
to the $78 billion five-year reduction in the defense budget
proposed in January. Budget negotiations between Obama and
Congress may lead to deeper cuts.  Job cuts have helped Lockheed remain profitable in sectors
where order volume is declining, Tanner said. For example, the
Space Systems unit is a “cost-plus contract environment, so
some of the reductions will make us more competitive and give us
affordability benefits,” he said.  In June, Lockheed announced 1,200 job cuts at the Space
unit, whose products include military satellites, rocket
launchers and space exploration work for  NASA .  Lockheed doesn’t have additional layoffs planned, he said.  Cuts ‘Possible’  “With the  defense budget  likely to decline for several
years, job cuts are quite possible to help sustain
profitability,”  Joel Levington , a bond analyst at Brookfield
Investment Management Inc. in New York, said in an e-mail.  If the Pentagon decides to reduce F-35 orders as a result
of the budget review and the broader U.S. goal to cut deficits
and debt, the airplanes’ price will rise, Stevens said on a
conference call today.  “When you plan to build 200 Joint Strike Fighters a year
and if you build fewer than that, the cost of those jets will be
more,” he said when asked what would happen if the U.S. Navy
reduces the size of its aircraft carrier fleet, thereby reducing
the number of carrier variants of the F-35 plane.  It’s “hard to handicap” how the F-35 program will fare in
the budget reviews, Stevens said.  Although the Navy plans to retain 11 aircraft carriers
through 2040, it’s studying options for a smaller fleet, Marine
General James Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, has said. The U.S. plans to buy 2,443 F-35 jets.  Unit Results  Quarterly earnings were reduced by $63 million stemming
from a $97 million charge relating to job cuts at the
Aeronautics unit that makes the F-35 jets, Lockheed said. The
reduction was offset by a tax benefit for the company of $89
million, resulting in a net increase of $26 million, it said.  Sales at two of Lockheed’s four units rose during the
quarter, led by an 8.9 percent gain in Aeronautics. The unit’s
revenue gained from trial orders for the F-35 aircraft as well
as work on the C-130J transport planes, the company said. Sales
at the unit rose to $3.42 billion, and profit rose 8 percent to
$400 million.  Electronic Systems, the unit that makes anti-missile
systems including the Patriot Advanced Capability-3, or  PAC-3 ,
missile and the  Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  system,
reported a 6.3 percent gain in sales to $3.76 billion. Unit
profits increased 5.7 percent to $466 million, aided by a higher
volume of PAC-3 work, the company said.  Information Systems  Sales at the Information Systems and Global Solutions unit
fell 6.4 percent to $2.36 billion. Profit at the unit, which
provides information technology services to U.S. agencies
including the Pentagon, increased 1.4 percent to $214 million.  Space Systems sales declined 3.3 percent to $2.01 billion,
Lockheed said. Unit profits rose 6.9 percent to $263 million.  The discontinued operations in the quarter refer to two
businesses that were sold and whose earnings were adjusted in
the second quarter of 2010. These include the Enterprise
Integration Group, which was sold to Veritas Capital for $815
million, and the sale of the Pacific Architects & Engineers unit
to private-equity firm Lindsay Goldberg completed April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
