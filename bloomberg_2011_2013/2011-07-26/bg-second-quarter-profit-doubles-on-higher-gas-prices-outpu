BG Group Plc (BG/) , the U.K.’s third-
largest natural-gas producer, said second-quarter profit doubled
on higher prices and production.  Net income rose to $1.24 billion from $602 million in the
year-earlier period, the Reading, England-based company said
today in a statement. Revenue gained 26 percent to $5.1 billion.  U.K. natural-gas prices were on average 58 percent higher
in the three months ended June 30 from a year earlier. BG failed
to capitalize in full from higher liquefied natural-gas prices
after hedging against possible losses. Production in the quarter
rose 3 percent to 58.9 million barrels of oil equivalent.  Excluding disposals and one-time items, earnings were $1.12
billion. That beat the $1.09 billion mean estimate from a survey
of 12 analysts.  “We made good progress in both our exploration and
production and LNG businesses”, Chief Executive Officer  Frank Chapman  said in a statement. “Progress that continues to de-
risk the delivery of our growth program.”  BG, which plans to invest $30 billion in  Brazil  in the next
decade, last month doubled its estimate of reserves and
resources in the  Santos Basin  off the Latin American country
coast to about 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent net to the
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
