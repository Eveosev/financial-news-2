De Beers , producer of more than a
third of the world’s rough diamonds, said first-half sales rose
33 percent to a record as demand in  India  and  China  drove up
prices and business in the U.S. exceeded its expectations.  Sales of rough diamonds by Diamond Trading Co., the
producer’s trading arm, climbed to $3.49 billion from $2.63
billion a year earlier, the Johannesburg-based company said in a
statement today. De Beers mined 15.5 million carats, compared
with 15.4 million a year earlier.  De Beers, 45 percent owned by  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , produces
diamonds from mines in Botswana,  Canada , Namibia and South
Africa. The global recession slashed prices in 2008, prompting
the company to idle as much as 90 percent of its output.  Prices of rough, or unpolished, diamonds increased by more
than 49 percent in the first half, adding to two straight annual
gains of more than 30 percent, according to WWW International
Diamond Consultants Ltd. While the U.S. remains the largest
retail market for the gems, demand from China and India has
helped fuel sales.  First-half sales matched the estimate by Royal Bank of
Canada analyst Des Kilalea of about $3.5 billion. The gem
producer faces rising costs in  South Africa , where workers
demanding pay increases of more than twice the inflation rate of
5 percent went on strike July 22.  South Africa’s Oppenheimer family owns 40 percent of De
Beers and the  Botswana  government the rest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
