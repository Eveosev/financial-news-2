Zimbabwe ’s indigenization and black
empowerment minister  Saviour Kasukuwere  was censured by the
parliamentary legal committee for publishing decrees that are
unconstitutional, the  Financial Gazette  said.  Kasukuwere, who wrote the Indigenization and Empowerment
Act, subsequently decreed that foreign and white Zimbabwean-
owned companies must dispose of 51 percent of their shares to
“designated entities,” the Harare-based weekly said on its
website. Kasukuwere’s definition of a designated entity isn’t
constitutional because it doesn’t allow businesses to choose
their partners, the Financial Gazette said.  The newspaper didn’t say what action, if any, would be
taken against Kasukuwere.  To contact the reporter on this story:
