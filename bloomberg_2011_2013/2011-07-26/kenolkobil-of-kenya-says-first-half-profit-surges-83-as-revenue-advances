KenolKobil Ltd., the Kenyan fuel
retailer with operations in nine African countries, said first-
half profit surged 83 percent as sales climbed and distribution
costs dropped.  Net income grew to 2.16 billion shillings ($23.9 million)
in the six months through June, from 1.18 billion shillings a
year earlier, the Nairobi-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today. Sales climbed 38 percent to 83.3 billion
shillings, the company said.  “Going forward, management forecast that the second half
of 2011 will be stronger than the same period” a year earlier,
it said.  Distribution costs dropped 4 percent, Chairman  Jacob Segman 
said in the statement. Kenol relied less on the Kenyan
distribution system “which is still unreliable and whose
inefficiencies continue to challenge the business,” he said.  “There is growth in margins and significant volume
upside,” Gregory Waweru, an analyst at Nairobi-based Kestrel
Capital East Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  The company’s directors recommended a dividend of 0.57
shillings.  Kenol’s shares retreated for the first time in four days,
losing 0.5 percent to 10.95 shillings by the 3 p.m. close in
Nairobi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
