U.S. natural-gas inventories
probably rose less than average last week as hot weather
increased demand for gas-powered electricity, according to
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Stockpiles gained 39 billion cubic feet, or 1.5 percent, to
2.71 trillion in the week ended July 22, based on the median of
seven estimates. The five-year average change for the week is an
increase of 49 billion, according to Energy Department data.
Supplies climbed 31 billion cubic feet a year earlier.  A strong heat wave drove temperatures in the Midwest and
East above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) last week.  New
York  reached a high of 104 degrees on July 22, the highest level
for the date, according to the  National Weather Service . Newark,
 New Jersey , set an all-time high of 108.  “Last week was very hot across much of the country,” said
 James Williams , an economist at WTRG Economics, an energy
research firm in London, Arkansas. “The gas market is ruled by
the weather.”  The stockpile estimates ranged from increases of 37 billion
to 52 billion cubic feet. The Energy Department’s weekly supply
report is scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. July 28 in
Washington.  Power plants  use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas
supplies, according to department data.  Gas storage levels increased 60 billion cubic feet to 2.671
trillion in the week ended July 15, the Energy Department
reported last week. Stockpiles were 2.2 percent below the five-
ear average and 7.4 percent below year-earlier levels.  Natural gas futures fell 14.7 cents, or 3.2 percent, to
$4.399 per million British thermal units last week on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . Prices today fell 1.6 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $4.37 on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
