Car prices in the European Union
fell 2.5 percent in real terms last year, the European
Commission said.  EU regulators said nominal prices for the 89 best-selling
car models rose 0.3 percent against a 2.8 percent increase in
overall consumer prices.  “It is good to see that consumers in  Europe  are
benefitting from competition in the markets for new car sales
and continue to enjoy significantly falling prices in real
terms,” said EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  in a
statement today.  Sales of new cars in Europe declined 4.9 percent to 13.8
million last year, the car industry group ACEA said in January.
European car deliveries declined after the expiration of
government cash-for-clunkers programs damped demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
