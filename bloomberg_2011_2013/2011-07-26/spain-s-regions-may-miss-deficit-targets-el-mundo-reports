Spanish regional governments may say
they won’t be able to meet deficit targets again this year,  El
Mundo  reported, citing the transcript of the last meeting that
members of regional governments held in April.  Regional politicians in charge of taxes, who are due
tomorrow to meet  Spain ’s Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  and
Manuel Chaves, a deputy prime minister in charge of relations
with the regions, may say they see the deficit targets as
impossible to achieve, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
