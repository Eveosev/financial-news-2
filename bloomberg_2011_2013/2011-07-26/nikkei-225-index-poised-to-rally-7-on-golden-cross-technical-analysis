Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average is
poised to advance at least 7 percent as it forms a so-called
golden cross, according to Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities Co.  The Nikkei 225’s 25-day moving average is less than 22
points from crossing above the 200-day moving average, forming a
“golden cross,” a bullish signal used by chart analysts. The
Nikkei jumped 5.6 percent from the last such cross, on Dec. 9,
through Feb. 21, when the gauge closed at its high this year of
10,857.53, less than a month before a magnitude-9 earthquake,
tsunami and nuclear disaster caused the biggest two-day decline
since 1987.  “It’s highly probable that the Nikkei will reach its high
this year, as this golden cross is a very reliable one in
signaling a bullish trend,” said Naohiko Miyata, chief
technical strategist at the brokerage unit of Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc.,  Japan ’s biggest bank by market value. This
golden cross is “one that is formed by moving averages that are
sloping up. It’s not a ‘fake’ signal we sometimes get when a
shorter gauge surpasses a slumping 200-day moving average.”  The chart signals the Nikkei will increase for at least a
few months, said Miyata, who did not give an estimate of when
the gauge will reach its next high. The gauge has surged 17
percent from this year’s low on March 15, closing at 10,097.72
on July 26.  Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
