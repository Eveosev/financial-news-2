Bank of England policy maker  Martin Weale  said it would be “naive” to exclude the risk of a  double
dip  in the U.K. economy, the German newspaper  Handelsblatt 
reported, citing an interview with the policy maker.  Even so, an increase in the central bank’s benchmark
interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in recent
months would have had “very little impact on demand,” while
signaling that the bank is equally worried about inflation and
economic growth prospects, the newspaper cited Weale as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
