Cash premiums for U.S. corn and
soybeans shipped this month to export terminals near  New Orleans 
widened relative to Chicago futures as increased processor
demand reduced shrinking supplies for exporters.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was 86 cents to 91 cents a bushel above September futures,
compared with 80 cents to 86 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The soybean premium was 76 cents to 84
cents a bushel above August futures, up from 72 cents to 84
cents yesterday.  “Most of the corn and soybeans are staying in the
domestic-processor market,” Scott Stoller, a grain merchandiser
for Michlig AgriCenter Inc. in Manlius,  Illinois , said in a
telephone interview. “Processors have recently outbid exporters
and now have acquired enough supplies until harvest” in
September and October, he said.  Corn futures for September delivery rose 11 cents, or 1.6
percent, to close at $6.8975 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest gain since July 13.  Soybean futures for August delivery jumped 17.5 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $13.83 a bushel, the first gain in three
sessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
