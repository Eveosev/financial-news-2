Raj Date, a former banker, will
replace  Elizabeth Warren  as adviser to the Treasury secretary
for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Aug. 1, the
Treasury Department said today.  Date, the associate director of the bureau for research,
markets and regulations, will run the day-to-day operations of
the new agency, which officially began work on July 21, Treasury
said today in a statement.  Since her appointment on Sept. 17, Warren has been setting
up the bureau as an adviser to Treasury Secretary  Timothy F.
Geithner  and assistant to President Barack Obama. She has been
on leave from Harvard Law School, and will return there,
Treasury said.  “Professor Warren has done an extraordinary job,”
Geithner said in an e-mailed statement.  Obama nominated  Richard Cordray , the former Ohio attorney
general, to be the first director of the agency, on July 18.
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the bureau’s director must be
confirmed by the Senate.  When a director is in place, the agency officially becomes
an independent bureau within the  Federal Reserve . Until then, it
doesn’t have the new powers created by Dodd-Frank, such as the
ability to supervise non-bank financial firms.  Date is a former banker with  Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) 
and Deutsche Bank AG. He also founded a research institute, the
Cambridge Winter Center for Financial Institutions Policy, and
participated in the debate over Dodd-Frank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
