Bank Millennium SA (MIL) , the Polish unit
of  Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP) , said second-quarter profit
soared 66 percent as loans and interest margins increased.  Net income rose to 115.3 million zloty ($42 million) from
69.5 million zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based bank said in
a regulatory filing today. The average estimate of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News was 112.9 million zloty.  Polish lenders are benefiting from accelerating growth in
central  Europe ’s biggest country. The economy will probably
expand by 4.2 percent in 2011, up from 3.8 percent last year,
according a Bloomberg survey of 29 economists.  Millennium’s net interest income, the difference between
what the company pays on deposits and what it charges on loans,
jumped 32 percent to 287.8 million zloty as total loans grew 5.8
percent to 38.6 billion zloty.  The net interest margin expanded to 2.5 percent in the
first half of the year, from 2.2 percent a year ago, helped by
rising central bank interest rates in  Poland .  The shares jumped as much as 1.7 percent to 5.46 zloty and
traded 0.6 percent higher at 5.4 zloty at 11:49 a.m. in Warsaw.  To contact the reporter on this story:
