Hog futures fell for the second
straight day on signs that supplies of U.S. pork are increasing
amid waning demand. Cattle rose the most in two weeks.  Hog shipments that slowed during the Midwest heat wave last
week have picked up amid cooler weather, and more animals are
available, said Jason Golly, a vice president of risk-management
marketing at Lynch Livestock Inc. Last week, spot-market hogs
jumped 7.2 percent, the most since November, government data
show. Higher prices curbed purchases by meatpackers, Golly said.  “The temperatures moderated, and we’re beginning to find
ample supplies,” he said in a telephone interview from Waucoma,
 Iowa .  Hog futures for October settlement dropped 0.775 cent, or
0.8 percent, to settle at 91.7 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Mercantile Exchange. The price dropped 0.1 percent
yesterday. The commodity has climbed 21 percent in the past
year.  Cattle futures for October delivery rose 1.25 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $1.1615 a pound in Chicago, the biggest gain for a
most-active contract since July 7. The price has jumped 24
percent in the past year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement climbed 0.05
cent to $1.361 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
