AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , Africa’s
largest gold producer, fell the most in four weeks in
Johannesburg trading as  South Africa ’s National Union of
Mineworkers said members would start a pay strike on July 28.  Miners at AngloGold, Harmony Gold Mining Ltd. and  Gold
Fields Ltd. (GFI)  will join strikers in the country’s petroleum, coal
and diamond industries after rejecting pay proposals. AngloGold
and Gold Fields offered an increase of 7.5 percent to 9 percent,
while Harmony proposed 7 percent to 8.5 percent. The union is
demanding 14 percent, almost three times the rate of inflation.  AngloGold dropped 3.1 percent to 293.27 rand by the 5 p.m.
close in Johannesburg, the biggest one-day slump since June 23.
Harmony,  Africa ’s second-biggest gold producer, slid 2.8 percent
to 94.30 rand, and Gold Fields fell 2.6 percent to 104.20 rand.  The union served a compulsory 48-hour notice of the strike,
the NUM said in a statement. South Africa’s gold mines employ
about 134,000 people, according to the Chamber of Mines.  South Africa, the biggest gold producer from 1905 to 2006,
fell to fifth place last year, according to London-based
researcher  GFMS Ltd . Costs per volume of resources mined were
the highest among the major miners measured in North America,
 Australia  and Latin America in 2010.  South African workers have been striking in the chemicals,
engineering, metals, diamond and coal industries, curbing output
from factories and mines since the beginning of the month. A
walkout of petroleum workers, now in its third week, has caused
gasoline shortages and forced  Sasol Ltd. (SOL) , which produces fuel
from coal and gas, to cut production at its plant in Secunda.  The country’s annual rate of consumer inflation was 5
percent in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
