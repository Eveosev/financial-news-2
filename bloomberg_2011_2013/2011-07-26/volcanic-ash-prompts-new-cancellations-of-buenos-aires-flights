An ash cloud from a volcanic
eruption in southern  Chile  has prompted cancellations of flights
from one of Buenos Aires’s two airports today.  At least 22 flights from the city’s Jorge Newbery airport,
which handles mostly domestic flights, have been canceled since
this morning, including one to  Sao Paulo  and one to Montevideo,
a press official for airport operator Aeropuertos Argentina
2000, who cannot be named under corporate policy, said in a
telephone interview. The city’s main international airport,
Ezeiza, is operating normally, the official said.  Chile’s Puyehue-Cordon Caulle volcanic complex began to
erupt on June 4, generating ash clouds that led to flight
cancellations because of concerns that they may clog  jet
engines . The ash affected flights from Miami to  Australia .  Aerolineas Argentinas SA,  Lan Airlines SA (LAN) ,  AMR Corp. (AMR) ’s
American Airlines, Alitalia SpA, Iberia and  Air France-KLM (AF)  Group
are among the airlines affected by cancellations since the
volcano erupted.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
