An attack today on  United Nations 
peacekeepers near the city of Sidon in southern Lebanon left
five soldiers injured, according to UN spokesman Farhan Haq.  A UN convoy was hit with an explosion, Haq said, with three
of the soldiers injured seriously enough to be hospitalized. The
UN sent forensic experts to work with the Lebanese military to
investigate the incident.  French peacekeepers in the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon were wounded, according to a U.S. statement issued by
Heide Bronke Fulton, acting State Department spokeswoman.  “This is the second assault on UNIFIL peacekeepers in
recent months,” she said. “We call on the government of
Lebanon to conduct a full investigation into the incident and
ensure the perpetrators are swiftly brought to justice.”  Six Italian peacekeepers were injured in a May 27 bombing
in southern Lebanon. In June 2007, a bombing attack on the
Spanish battalion killed six peacekeepers.  The UN has almost 12,000 soldiers and civilian police in
the region as part of its mission to monitor a cease-fire in the
2006 war between  Israel  and the Hezbollah militia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
