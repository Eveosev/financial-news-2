Hungary ’s government will submit a
2012 budget draft to parliament by Sept. 30, containing a target
deficit of 2.5 percent of economic output, according to the
Economy Ministry.  “In the 2012 budget, all the conditions and tools must be
set up that protect Hungary and the economy from the risks
stemming from global economic processes,” the ministry said in
a document posted on its  website  late yesterday.  Hungary, which needed a bailout led by the  International
Monetary Fund  in 2008, secured a promise from China in June that
it will buy Hungarian government debt. The government may also
sell part of its recently acquired stake in refiner Mol Nyrt. in
the event of financing difficulties,  Mihaly Varga , the prime
minister’s chief of staff, said in an interview with  Gazdasagi
Radio  last week.  Parliament is scheduled to vote on the budget on Dec.
19-20, according to the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
