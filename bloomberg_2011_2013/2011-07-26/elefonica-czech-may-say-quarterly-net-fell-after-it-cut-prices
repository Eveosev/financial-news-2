Telefonica  Czech Republic  AS, the
country’s largest phone operator, may say second-quarter
profit fell as it lowered prices to compete with rivals,
customers spent less on calls and regulatory changes eroded
revenue.  Net income for the three months ended June 30 probably
dropped to 1.95 billion koruna ($114.6 million) from 2.34
billion koruna a year earlier, according to the median
estimate of five analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. Revenue
probably declined 7.1 percent to 13.06 billion koruna.  “There’s an overall decline of revenue in the whole
industry as companies lowered prices to compete for clients
and regulatory changes cut interconnection fees,” Cyrrus AS
analyst Ondrej Moravansky said by phone. “They’re cutting
costs, but that’s not enough to offset the fall.” Moravansky
recommends investors to “accumulate” the shares.  Telefonica Czech Republic, a unit of  Spain ’s largest
phone company Telefonica SA, provides mobile, fixed line and
Internet services in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It will
report earnings tomorrow in Prague.  To contact the reporter on this story:
