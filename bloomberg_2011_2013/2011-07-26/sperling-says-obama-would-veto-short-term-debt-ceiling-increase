President  Barack Obama  would veto a
short-term, six-month increase in the debt ceiling, the director
of the White House National Economic Council said.  “The president has been pretty clear that he does not find
that acceptable,” Gene Sperling said in an interview on MSNBC
today. Sperling said “a faction” of House Republicans is
blocking “this type of compromise, this balance that could get
us there” in raising the debt ceiling and avoiding default.  Separately, the No. 2 Democrat in the U.S. Senate,  Dick Durbin  of Illinois, said if there’s no deal by the Aug. 2
default deadline, the U.S. will have about $172 billion in
revenue coming in to pay $306 billion in bills.  “We will have to make a choice” on paying Social
Security, Medicare beneficiaries, military pay and others owed
government payments, Durbin said on  MSNBC . “This political
battle should be put behind us.’”  To contact the reporter on this story:
