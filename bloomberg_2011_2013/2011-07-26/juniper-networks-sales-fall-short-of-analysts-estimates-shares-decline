Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR)  tumbled the
most in more than a decade after the second-largest maker of
Internet networking equipment reported sales and profit that
missed estimates after customers put off buying new gear.  Juniper’s shares plunged $6.51, or 21 percent, to $24.66 at
4 p.m. on the  New York  Stock Exchange, for the biggest drop
since November 2000. The stock has fallen 33 percent this year.  The company is grappling with slower-than-expected spending
by some customers, including Internet carriers, which are
delaying purchases and waiting for new products amid concerns
about economic growth. Juniper’s revenue from service providers
rose 18 percent in the second quarter, following a jump of 25
percent in the first quarter. Third-quarter and full-year sales
growth also may be less than analysts projected.  “Across the board there was no shortage of concerns and
cautionary comments,” said Jason Ader, an analyst at William
Blair & Co. in  Boston , who rates the stock “outperform.”
“It’s a fairly large deterioration in their business.”  Second-quarter profit excluding some costs was 31 cents a
share, the Sunnyvale, California-based company said yesterday in
a statement. Revenue rose 15 percent to $1.12 billion from
$978.3 million a year earlier. Analysts on average had projected
profit of 33 cents a share and sales of $1.15 billion, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Third-quarter revenue will be $1.07 billion to $1.12
billion, Juniper said. Profit excluding some items will be 26
cents to 30 cents a share. Analysts projected $1.22 billion in
sales and 38 cents in profit.  Second Half  “We are cautious about the second half yet very optimistic
about our position going into 2012,” Chief Executive Officer
 Kevin Johnson  said on a conference call. “We look to grow
faster than the market in 2011 while strengthening the
innovation portfolio as we set up for 2012.”  Slower spending in  Japan , lower-than-expected demand from
carriers and economic concerns were among the reasons for
caution, he said.  For the year, the company expects revenue growth of 12
percent to 14 percent, Chief Financial Officer Robyn Denholm
said on the call. Before yesterday’s forecast, analysts had
expected an increase of 18 percent.  The company forecast adjusted operating margin of 19
percent to 21 percent for the third quarter. Rohit Chopra, an
analyst at Wedbush Securities in New York, had estimated
operating margin would be about 23 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
