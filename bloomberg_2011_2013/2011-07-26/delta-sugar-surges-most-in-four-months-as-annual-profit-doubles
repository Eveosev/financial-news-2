Delta Sugar,  Egypt â€™s biggest
publicly traded sugar refiner, surged the most in almost four
months after annual profit more than doubled.  The shares climbed 5 percent, the most since April 3, to
21.07 Egyptian pounds at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo. That gave
the company a market value of 2.61 billion pounds ($438
million). The benchmark EGX30 Index retreated 0.4 percent.  Net income for the year that ended June 30 rose to 279.5
million pounds from 113.9 million pounds.  About 113,000 shares of Delta traded today, compared with a
daily average of 53,000 shares since March 23, when Egyptian
stocks resumed trading after a near two-month suspension because
of political unrest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
