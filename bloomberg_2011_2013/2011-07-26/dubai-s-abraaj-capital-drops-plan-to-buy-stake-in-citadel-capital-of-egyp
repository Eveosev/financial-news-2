Abraaj Capital Ltd., a Dubai-based
private equity company, said it dropped plans to acquire a stake
in Egyptian private equity firm  Citadel Capital  SAE.  Abraaj “is no longer currently exploring a transaction
with Citadel Capital” the company said in an e-mailed statement
today. “This does not preclude Abraaj Capital from exploring
such a transaction in the future should performance, deal terms
and, or circumstances change.”  Citadel said on July 17 that its first-quarter loss widened
to 114.2 million Egyptian pounds ($19 million) from 33.7 million
pounds as some companies in which it owns stakes were less
productive amid unrest in the North African country.  The company said on June 22 that its main shareholder is
holding talks with investors on the possible sale of a stake in
the firm. The talks between Citadel Capital Partners Ltd. and
“more than one potential strategic investor” are at an early
stage, it said.  Shares of Citadel Capital dropped 1.7 percent to 5.07
Egyptian pounds at the 2:30 p.m. close of trading in Cairo
today, valuing the company at 3.35 billion pounds. The
announcement was made after trading hours.  No one at Citadel Capital was immediately available for
comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
