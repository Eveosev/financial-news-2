Ryan Lochte of the U.S. beat his
teammate and 14-time Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps in the
200-meter freestyle final at the world swimming championships.  Lochte won in 1 minute, 44.44 seconds in  Shanghai , 0.35
second ahead of Phelps and 0.44 second in front of Germany’s
Paul Biedermann, the defending champion and world record-holder.  Two days ago, Phelps had been part of the U.S. team that
failed to retain its 400-meter freestyle relay title. The
Americans finished third behind Australia and France.  Phelps, who had led today’s race over the first 100 meters,
has said he will retire after the  2012 Olympics  in London.  No world records were set during the first two days of the
eight-day championships, extending the long-course drought since
high-tech bodysuits were banned 1 1/2 years ago. Forty-three
records fell at the 2009 world championships in Rome.  It’s the last major international swimming meet before next
year’s Summer Games in  London , which start a year from tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
