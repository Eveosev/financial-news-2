European Central Bank Governing
Council memberAndres Lipstok said the bank’s benchmark  interest
rate  remains “very low” even after policy makers tightened
borrowing costs this month.  “Even after the recent increase in key interest rates,
monetary policy interest rates still remain very low in
historical comparison,” Lipstok wrote in an opinion piece for
 Estonia ’s Postimees newspaper. “In other words, the monetary
policy of the euro area’s central banks strongly supports the
recovery of economic growth.”  The Frankfurt-based ECB lifted its benchmark lending rate
to 1.5 percent this month to prevent higher prices in the 17-
nation region from feeding into wage demands, entrenching even
faster inflation. Euro-area annual consumer price gains probably
held steady at 2.7 percent in July, a Bloomberg survey of
economists shows. Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics
office in Luxembourg, will release that data on July 29.  “Interest rates that remain low for an extended period
increase the risk appetite of the financial sector,” Lipstok
said. “Higher risk appetite together with optimistic
expectations may rapidly lead to excessive loan growth and an
increase in the prices of various assets, which will result in
the creation of bubbles in the financial sector and the whole
economy.”  “Focusing excessively on the situation of struggling
countries would entail a threat of price rise acceleration in
the entire euro area,” he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
