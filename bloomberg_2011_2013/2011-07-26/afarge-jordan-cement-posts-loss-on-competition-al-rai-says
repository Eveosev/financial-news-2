Jordan Cement Factories, the
kingdom’s largest cement company, majority-owned by Financiere
 Lafarge SA (LG)  , made a first-half loss of 2.7 million dinars ($3.8
million) on greater competition,  Al Rai  said.  The factory made 8.9 million dinars in profit during the
same period of 2010, the newspaper said, citing an unidentified
official. The losses are due to an increase in supply in the
Jordanian market after the opening in March of a fourth cement
factory, a decline in demand and increasing costs, Al Rai said.  Production capacity of the country’s cement facilities is
estimated at 10 million metric tons per year, while annual needs
stand at about 3.5 million tons, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
