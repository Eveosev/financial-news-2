Stephen Freidheim, senior managing
partner at closely held investment adviser Cyrus Capital
Partners LP, purchased a co-op on  Manhattan ’s Fifth Avenue for
$26.8 million, New York City public records show.  The purchase of the two-story penthouse was completed on
July 15, according to records filed today with the New York City
Department of Finance. The five-bedroom, five-bath co-op was
owned by the same family since its 1925 construction, according
to a listing by Leighton Candler, a Corcoran Group Inc. broker,
on the  StreetEasy.com  property website.  The transaction amount was a 21 percent discount to the
last asking price. The co-op was listed for $50 million in 2007
and, after being pulled from the market and relisted several
times at lower prices, it was cut to $34 million in December
2009, according to StreetEasy.  Freidheim didn’t return a voicemail seeking comment about
the purchase. He was a managing director and partner at Bankers
Trust Co. in the 1990s, according to the  website  for  New York- 
based Cyrus.  The purchase was reported earlier today by the Curbed NY
 website .  The co-op features a “terrace of mammoth proportions,” a
40-foot-long (12-meter-long) grand salon and windows overlooking
Central Park and the  Metropolitan Museum  of Art, according to
the listing on StreetEasy. The penthouse was sold by the estate
of Virginia W. Kress, heiress to the 20th-century discount
retailer Samuel Kress.  -- Editors: Daniel Taub, Christine Maurus  To contact the reporter:
