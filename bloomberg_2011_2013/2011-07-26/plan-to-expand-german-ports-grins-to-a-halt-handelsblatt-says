A 2009 plan to expand German ports
and connections to the hinterland has ground to a halt due to
lack of funds,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing participants at
meeting between the states, shipping associations and federal
government last week.  The participants couldnâ€™t agree on which projects to
prioritize, making it unclear how they will proceed, according
to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
