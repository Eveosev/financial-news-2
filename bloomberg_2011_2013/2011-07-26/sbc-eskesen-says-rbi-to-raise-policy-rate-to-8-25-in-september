Leif Lybecker Eskesen, Singapore-
based chief economist for Indian and ASEAN at HSBC Ltd.,
comments on  India ’s monetary policy in a research note.  The  Reserve Bank  of India increased the repurchase rate to
8 percent from 7.5 percent today and raised the inflation
forecast for the year ending March to 7 percent from 6 percent.  “While the 50 basis points hike was an aggressive move,
this is not the end of it. RBI is seriously concerned about
anchoring inflation expectations and we expect that the policy
rate will reach at least 8.25 percent this year.  “While the...hike today may give the RBI breathing room
for a pause next time they meet (September), there is an equally
high probability that growth and inflation will not ease as much
as anticipated in the meantime, triggering another hike as soon
as the next meeting.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
