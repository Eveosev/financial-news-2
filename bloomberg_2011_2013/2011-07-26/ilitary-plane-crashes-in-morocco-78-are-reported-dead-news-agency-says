A Moroccan military transport plane
crashed into a mountain in bad weather in the southern part of
the country, killing 78 people, the state-run Agence Maghreb
Arab Presse reported.  The C-130 crashed as it was about to land at a military
airport near the southern city of Guelmim, MAP said. Three
people were injured in the crash, it said, citing a military
statement. The plane was carrying 60 armed forces members, 12
civilians and nine crew members, it said.  Rescue efforts are continuing at the site, MAP said.  The last time a plane crashed in  Morocco  was in 1994 when a
Royal Air Maroc plane went down near the southwestern city of
Agadir, killing all 44 passengers and crew on board, state
television said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
