Shuaa Capital PSC (SHUAA) , the investment
bank controlled by Dubai’s ruler, returned to profit in the
second quarter after posting two consecutive quarterly losses
amid the political turmoil in the Middle East.  Second-quarter profit was 600,000 dirhams ($163,000) after
a loss of 56.6 million dirhams a year earlier, Shuaa said in an
e-mailed statement today. Revenue rose to 35.7 million dirhams
from 33 million dirhams, while total expenses fell 7 percent to
62.8 million dirhams.  “It is reasonable to expect that with an improvement in
market conditions, we will generate further momentum with our
clients, build market share and start executing investment
banking mandates,” Chief Executive Officer Sameer Al Ansari
said in the statement.  Shuaa said in May it planned to eliminate 10.7 percent of
full-time employees after it posted a second consecutive
quarterly loss in the first quarter. Financial markets in the
Middle East were hurt by regional uprisings, which have toppled
governments in Egypt and Tunisia, sparked a civil war in Libya
and riots in Syria and Yemen.  Shuaa plans to seek shareholders approval today to change
the composition of its board by allowing more nationals from the
Gulf Cooperation Council countries. Majority of the board
members are currently required to be the national of the United
Arab Emirates.  The shares surged 5.3 percent, the most since July 18, to 1
dirham, and were trading at 97 fils at 11:27 a.m. in Dubai. The
stock has lost 22 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
