China ’s yuan advanced to its
strongest level in 17 years as the central bank set the
currency’s reference rate at a record high.  The People’s Bank of China set the daily fixing 0.05
percent stronger at 6.4470 per dollar. The currency has gained
0.3 percent this month on speculation policy makers will
tolerate appreciation to quell the fastest inflation in three
years. The Dollar Index traded on ICE Futures in  New York 
dropped for a second day as President Barack Obama said the two
sides of American politics are in a stalemate over raising the
U.S. debt ceiling.  “For the yuan and other Asian currencies, the attention
will again move back to inflation,” said  Philip Wee , a senior
foreign-exchange economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in
 Singapore . “The dollar will continue to weaken. Investors need
to see fiscal consolidation in the U.S., not short-term fixes.”  The yuan rose 0.03 percent to 6.4428 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The currency touched 6.4427 earlier, the strongest level since
the country unified official and market exchange rates at the
end of 1993.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the currency rose 0.07
percent to 6.4415. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained
0.2 percent to 6.3746, a 1.1 percent premium to the onshore spot
rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Consumer prices in China rose 6.4 percent last month, the
most since June 2008, according to official data released on
July 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
