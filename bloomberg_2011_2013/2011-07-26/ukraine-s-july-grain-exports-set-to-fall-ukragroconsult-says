Ukraine’s grain exports are set to
decline from last month, reaching 132,700 metric tons in the
first 18 days of July, UkrAgroConsult said.  June exports came to 806,300 tons, the Kiev-based
researcher said, without giving a separate figure for the first
18 days of last month.  Shipments this month included 21,500 tons of wheat, 67,200
tons of barley and 32,100 tons of corn, UkrAgroConsult said
today by e-mail. Another 257,800 tons of grain will be exported
in the near future, the researcher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
