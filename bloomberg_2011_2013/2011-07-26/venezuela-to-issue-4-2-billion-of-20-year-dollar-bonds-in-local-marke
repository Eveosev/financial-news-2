Venezuela  will sell $4.2 billion of
bonds due in 2031 in the oil-producing country’s first offering
since August.  Venezuela will sell the 11.95 percent bonds at face value
and announce the results of the offering on Aug. 1, according to
a  statement  published on the central bank’s website today.
Venezuela hired Deutsche Bank and Evrofinance Mosnarbank SA to
handle the sale.  “This is an extremely high amount that represents about 13
percent of the country’s external bond debt,”  Boris Segura , a
Latin America strategist at Nomura Securities International Inc.
said in an interview. “The market will have a tough time
digesting this new supply.”  President  Hugo Chavez , who raised the debt ceiling this
year by 85 percent, will use the proceeds to finance government
projects to build homes and boost agricultural output, the
statement said. Venezuela sells dollar-denominated bonds to
locals in bolivars to help meet demand for foreign currency.  The yield on Venezuela’s 9.25 percent benchmark bonds due
in 2027 rose 3 basis points, or 0.03 percent, to 12.90 percent
at 3:52 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The bond’s price fell 0.16 cents on the dollar to
75.47 cents.  Venezuela sold $3 billion of 12.75 percent bonds due in
2022 in August. State-run oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA
issued about $8 billion of bonds this year.  Secondary Market  Venezuela will allocate at least 40 percent of the offering
to companies registered with the  foreign exchange board , the
statement said. Individual investors and companies not
registered with the board can also put in orders of a minimum
$3,000 calculated at the official exchange rate of 4.3 bolivars
per dollar.  The bonds may begin to trade in the secondary market at a
price of about 81.1 cents on the dollar and yield 14.94 percent,
RBS Securities Inc. said today in a report.  Venezuela bought a 49 percent stake in  Russia ’s Evrofinance
Mosnarbank SA for $400 million in February, according to Moscow-
based news agency RIA Novosti. Venezuela authorized the bank to
open a commercial branch in Caracas yesterday.  Venezuela’s state development bank Fonden has 49.9 percent
of the bank while Russia’s VTB Group and Gazprombank Group share
the remaining stakes, according to the  bank’s website .  Ghana and  Indonesia  were the last governments to sell bonds
with an interest rate of 11.95 percent since 2008, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “As opposed to earlier issues people were talking about
this exact size and maturity for about a week,”  Jeff Williams ,
emerging-market debt strategist at Citigroup Inc. in New York
said. “There will be demand for locals and offshore it’s based
on what people were already pricing in.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
