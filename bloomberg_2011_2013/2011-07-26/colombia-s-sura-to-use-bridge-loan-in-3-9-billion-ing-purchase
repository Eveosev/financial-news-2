Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana,
the parent company of  Colombia ’s largest bank, plans on using a
bridge loan to help finance its $3.9 billion purchase of ING
assets in  Latin America .  “There is a bridge loan from six international banks as
well as local credits that would be released in foreign
branches, and hence, in dollars, which we would not need to
bring to Colombia,” Bernal said in an e-mailed response from
the company.  Suramericana this week agreed to pay about 2.7 billion
euros ($3.9 billion) for most of the Latin American insurance
operations of  ING Groep NV. (INGA)   Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos urged Suramericana
today not to pay for the purchase outside of Colombia as the
government seeks to stem gains in the peso. The currency has
jumped 8.9 percent since March 1, the best performance among 25
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg, as foreign
investment climbed to a record.  Bernal didn’t comment on the size of the loan.  The sale includes ING’s pensions, life insurance and
investment management operations in  Chile , Colombia, Mexico,
Uruguay and Peru.  To contact the reporter on this story:
