Sandesh Kirkire, chief executive
officer of Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Ltd. in Mumbai,
comments on the outlook for equities after the central bank
increased its benchmark  interest rate  by a more-than-estimated
0.5 percentage point. Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund held 342
billion rupees ($7.7 billion) in assets as on June 30.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
1.5 percent to 18,586.44 as of 12:37 p.m. Mumbai time, set for
the biggest decline in two weeks. The measure is the biggest
loser in  Asia  today.  “Higher rates will impact company earnings, which in turn
will affect stock prices. The rate hike is higher than expected
and is clearly disappointing. How many more hikes we will get is
anybody’s guess. The RBI has not spelt out its direction. On the
other hand, it hasn’t changed its current fiscal year growth
estimate.”  The  Reserve Bank  of  India  raised its repurchase rate to 8
percent from 7.5 percent. None of the 22 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News predicted today’s decision, 20 estimated a
quarter-point rise, while the remainder expected no change.  On sector preferences:  “We continue to stay invested in defensives as there is no
clear indication the rate cycle is going to pause. We have to
wait and watch. We are seeing signs of growth moderation. We are
certain that rates will not come down soon.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
