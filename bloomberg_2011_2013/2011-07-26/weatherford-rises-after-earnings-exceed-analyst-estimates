Weatherford International Ltd. (WFT)  rose
the most in almost four months after second-quarter profit
exceeded analysts’ estimates and it forecast higher sales growth
for the year.  Weatherford climbed $1.69, or 8.3 percent, to $22.14 at
12:22 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
company rose as much as 10 percent, the biggest intraday gain
since March 29. Before today, shares in the Geneva-based
oilfield-services provider had dropped 10 percent this year.  The company reported net income of $110.1 million, or 15
cents a share, from $59.2 million, or 8 cents, according to a
statement today. Excluding costs associated with severance
payments and a government investigation, per-share profit was 2
cents more than the average of 32 analysts’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  “The company has underperformed for so long,” said Joe
Hill, a Houston-based analyst for Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. LLC
who rates the company at “accumulate” and owns 9,000 shares.
“You finally got some good news on earnings performance that
you had this pent-up demand. You’ve probably got some short
covering going on today as well.”  Revenue rose 25 percent to $3.05 billion, a record for the
company, according to the statement. Weatherford’s 2011 revenue
is expected to increase 25 percent from last year, up from the
previous estimate of a 20 percent rise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
