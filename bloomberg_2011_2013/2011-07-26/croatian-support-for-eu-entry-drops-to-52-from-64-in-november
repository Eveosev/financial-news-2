Croatian support for membership in
the  European Union , which will probably admit the Balkan country
in July 2013, fell to 52 percent from a record-high 64 percent
in November, polling company  IPSOS-Puls  said.  Some 52 percent of those surveyed said they would vote to
join the bloc in a referendum, with 38 percent saying they would
vote against it, according to a poll commissioned by the  Foreign
Ministry . The survey of 943 adults was carried out from July 1
to July 20, according to e-mailed statement today. No margin of
error was given.  Croatia concluded five-year-long negotiations with the
world’s biggest trading bloc in June. It will probably sign the
EU accession treaty in December.  The referendum must be held within 30 days after signing
the treaty.  Croatia ’s accession also needs to be ratified by
parliaments of all 27 member states.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story:
