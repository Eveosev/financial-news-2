BP Plc (BP/) ’s profit from refining fell
36 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier as a U.S.
plant halt prevented  Europe ’s second-biggest oil company from
capitalizing on higher fuel prices in that region.  BP’s replacement-cost profit before interest and tax
declined to $1.34 billion from $2.08 billion a year ago, the
London-based company said today in a statement.  Inventory losses amounted to $482 million compared with a
gain of $225 million a year ago, BP said in the statement. The
company’s supply and trading division swung to a “small” loss
in the quarter, it said. Sales fell 2.4 percent, with declines
in all regions.  The amount of crude oil processed by BP’s U.S. refineries
dropped to 1.19 million barrels daily in the second quarter,
from 1.35 million barrels a year earlier because of
“operational issues” at its Texas City plant following a  power
outage , BP said. Throughput at all sites declined to 2.25
million barrels a day versus 2.43 million barrels.  The profit from turning crude into fuels such as gasoline
and diesel along the U.S. Gulf Coast was the highest of six
regions surveyed globally, at $16.81 a barrel, according to BP.
That’s up from $11.24 a barrel a year ago. The second-best
region was the U.S. West Coast with $15.75 a barrel.  BP expects “a typical seasonal decline in refining margins
in the third quarter,” it said. Its planned turnaround
activities will be lower in the second half of the year than in
the first half, it said. The 475,000 barrel-a-day Texas City
refinery will process at full capacity in August, BP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
