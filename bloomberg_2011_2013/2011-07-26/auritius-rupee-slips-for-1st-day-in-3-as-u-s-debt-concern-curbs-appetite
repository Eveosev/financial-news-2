Mauritius’s rupee weakened for the
first time in three days as U.S. lawmakers struggled to reach an
accord to raise the nation’s debt ceiling by an Aug. 2 deadline,
curbing demand for riskier frontier-market assets.  The currency depreciated as much as 0.2 percent to 28.10
per dollar and traded at 28.05 by 11:23 a.m. in Port Louis, the
capital. Versus the euro, currency of the country’s main trading
partner, the rupee weakened 1 percent to 40.7062.  President  Barack Obama  warned yesterday of a “deep
economic crisis” without a compromise to avert a  U.S. debt 
default and called on lawmakers to put politics aside to reach a
deal on a “balanced approach” to lifting the U.S.’s $14.3
trillion debt ceiling. House Speaker  John Boehner  said the
president “wants a blank check” to continue spending.  “The rate is being driven by international market forces
and the focus is on U.S. debt,” Nitish Benimadhu, a foreign-
currency and fund manager at Port Louis-based Anglo-Mauritius
Financial Services Ltd., said by phone today.  Sixty-seven percent of the Indian Ocean island nation’s
import bill is denominated in dollars, according to Bank of
Mauritius data.  The buying price for the dollar ranged from 27.2389 rupees
to 27.4013 rupees, with a selling price of 28.689 rupees per
dollar, according to indicative rates on  Bank of Mauritius’s
website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
