First Bank of Nigeria Plc (FIRSTBAN) , the
country’s third-biggest lender by market value, said its first-
half profit climbed by 23 percent.  Net income increased to 31.3 billion naira ($205 million)
in the six months through June, compared with 25.3 billion naira
a year earlier, the Lagos-based lender said today in an e-mailed
statement. Revenue rose to 139.7 billion naira from 122.3
billion naira, while operating income increased to 120.9 billion
naira from 85.6 billion naira.  The lender “grew deposits, especially in the low-cost
segments, by 32 percent in the first half,” Chief Executive
Officer Bisi Onasanya, said in the statement. “This, in turn,
helped lower our cost of funds and drove strong net interest
income and margin expansion.”  First Bank has experienced a steady growth in profit since
a slump in 2009 after it set aside 29.5 billion naira for losses
from bad loans as Nigerian banks faced a financial crisis caused
in part by loans to stock speculators. The central bank fired
the chief executives of eight of the country’s 24 banks for
their handling of the crisis and bailed them out with 620
billion naira. First Bank wasn’t among the affected lenders.  Under new a licensing rule introduced by regulators, First
Bank has adopted the holding company structure, aiming to expand
across sub-Saharan  Africa  while divesting its record-keeping
business and non-core real estate assets, it said.  “First Bank is still one of our favorite picks,”
Johannesburg-based Securities Africa, wrote in an e-mailed note
to clients today, citing its “resilient income generating
capabilities despite turbulent conditions.”  The stock was unchanged at 12.2 naira at 14:19 p.m. in
today’s trading at the  Nigerian Stock Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
