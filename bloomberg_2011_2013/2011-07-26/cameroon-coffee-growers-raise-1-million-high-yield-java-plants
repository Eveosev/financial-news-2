Cameroon coffee growers have planted
about 1 million high-yielding java plants in the past four
years, the group that supplied them said.  The species is being grown on more than 1,000 hectares
(2,470 acres), Christopher Mbah, general manager of
the North West Cooperative Association Ltd., said today by phone
from Bamenda, the group’s headquarters, about 400 kilometers
(248 miles) northwest of the capital, Yaounde. The group, based
in the country’s main arabica-producting region, represents more
than 35,000 farmers.  The plants are grown with minimal use of fertilizers and
yield at least 1.5 metric tons of beans a hectare, compared with
more traditional species that produced 250 kilograms (551
pounds) a hectare, according to Francis Fang, the cooperative’s
president, in a July 23 interview in Bamenda. The association
gave the plants to the farmers free.  The North West region produces about 75 percent of the
west-central African nation’s output of the arabica variety,
Mbah said. Total production of arabica rose 17 percent to 3,500
tons in 2010, Michael Ndoping, general manager of the Cocoa and
Coffee Board, said Feb. 21. Output of robusta beans rose 20
percent to 53,000 tons.  Arabica coffee is grown mainly in  Latin America  and favored
for specialty beverages such as those made by Starbucks Corp.
Robusta, used in instant coffee and espresso, is harvested
mostly in  Asia  and parts of  Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
