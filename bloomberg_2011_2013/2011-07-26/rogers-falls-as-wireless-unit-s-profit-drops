Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI/B) ,  Canada ’s
largest wireless carrier, fell the most in nine months after
profit at its wireless business dropped amid a slide in
customers’ average monthly bills.  Operating profit excluding some costs at the wireless unit,
which accounts for more than half of revenue, fell 7 percent to
C$761 million ($806 million), Toronto-based Rogers said today.  Rogers is facing competition from  Telus Corp. (T)  and  BCE Inc. (BCE) ,
as well as smaller market entrants such as Public Mobile which
target customers with cheaper prepaid plans. Smaller monthly
wireless bills combined with higher corporate spending on
equipment and phone subsidies hurt Rogers’ profitability, said
 Maher Yaghi , an analyst at Desjardins Securities in  Montreal .  “The company’s wireless division continues to be a drag on
results,” said Yaghi, who has a “hold” rating on Rogers.  Rogers fell C$1.32, or 3.5 percent, to C$36.50 at 4:15 p.m.
in Toronto Stock Exchange trading, the biggest drop since Oct.
26. The shares have climbed 5.5 percent this year.  The average monthly bill for wireless users fell C$3.01 to
C$60.26, missing Desjardins’ C$62.20 estimate. Total revenue
rose 3.2 percent to C$3.12 billion, compared with the average
analyst estimate of C$3.13 billion.  Net income slid to C$410 million, or 75 cents a share, from
C$452 million, or 77 cents, a year earlier. Profit excluding
some items was 85 cents a share. Analysts predicted 81 cents,
the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Rogers added 108,000 customers on contract, beating Yaghi’s
estimate of 65,000 newer customers.  “The real bulk of the profitability comes from postpaid
net additions and those were good,” Yaghi said.  Rogers left its full-year sales and profit guidance
unchanged from February. At the time it projected operating
profit, excluding some items, of C$4.6 billion to C$4.77 billion
in 2011 and wireless revenue of between C$6.53 billion and
C$6.73 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
