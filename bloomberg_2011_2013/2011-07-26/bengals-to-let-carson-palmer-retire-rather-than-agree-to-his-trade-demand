Cincinnati Bengals owner  Mike Brown 
said he’ll let Carson Palmer retire rather than agree to trade
the quarterback, the National Football League team said on its
website.  Brown denied Palmer’s request to be traded on Feb. 7 after
the Bengals finished 4-12 last season.  Palmer told a Cincinnati television station in March that
he would rather retire than return to the Bengals, saying he had
$80 million in the bank and that, “I don’t have to play
football for money. I’ll play it for the love of the game but
that would have to be elsewhere.” He is  signed  through 2014.  Palmer, 31, was selected first overall by the Bengals in
2003  NFL draft . The two-time Pro Bowl passer has a 46-51 record
as the team’s starting quarterback, throwing 154 touchdowns and
100 interceptions.  Brown said today that a trade would reward Palmer for
failing to play out his contract, and that the team would move
ahead with second-round draft pick Andy Dalton as the possible
starter, the team said.  NFL transactions began today following the conclusion of a
four-month lockout the led to a 10-year labor contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
