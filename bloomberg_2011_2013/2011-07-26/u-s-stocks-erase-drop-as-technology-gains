U.S. stocks trimmed losses as Senate
Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said he’s open to compromises on
plans to cut the deficit, while  Lexmark International Inc. (LXK)  and
Broadcom Corp. led a rally in technology companies.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell less than 0.1 percent
to 1,336.96 at 2:40 p.m. in  New York  after losing as much as 0.6
percent earlier. Lexmark surged 18 percent and Broadcom advanced
10 percent to lead technology shares to the biggest gain in the
index among 10 industries after each reported earnings that
topped analysts’ estimates.  Earlier declines were led by industrial shares following
outlooks from 3M Co. and United Parcel Service Inc. that
disappointed investors.  Reid said today that credit rating services have said his
proposal for raising the U.S. debt limit wouldn’t lead them to
lower the government’s credit rating. CNN last night cited an
unidentified investor as saying that S&P said the Reid bill
would avoid a lowering of the U.S. credit rating.  By contrast, Reid said today, the Republican plan offered
by House Speaker  John Boehner  “gives the credit agencies no
choice but to downgrade U.S. debt.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
