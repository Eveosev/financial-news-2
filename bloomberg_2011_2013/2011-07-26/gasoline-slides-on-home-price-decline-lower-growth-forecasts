Gasoline advanced as  consumer
confidence  rose from an eight-month low and a weaker dollar
increased the investment appeal of commodities.  Futures rose 0.9 percent after the Conference Board’s
confidence index climbed in July to 59.5 from a revised 57.6
reading in June. The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S.
currency against the currencies of six U.S. trading partners,
fell 0.8 percent as of 3:37 p.m. in  New York .  “The market just turned around on the dollar,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York.  Gasoline for August delivery rose 2.72 cents to settle at
$3.1536 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The more
actively traded September contract increased 1.68 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $3.0985 a gallon.  Economists predicted the New York-based private research
group’s July gauge of consumer sentiment would fall to 56,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, declined
0.1 cent to $3.693 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  Heating oil for August delivery rose 0.56 cent to $3.1134 a
gallon the exchange. The September contract increased 0.44 cent
to $3.1251.  To contact the reporter on this story:
