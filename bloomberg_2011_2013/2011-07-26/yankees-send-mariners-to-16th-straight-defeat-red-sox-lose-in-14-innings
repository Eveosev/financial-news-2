The  New York Yankees  sent the
Seattle Mariners to a 16th straight loss, winning the opener of
their three-game series 10-3 last night behind home runs from
Derek Jeter and Mark Teixeira.  Jeter and Teixeira each drove in three runs for New York,
which took an 8-1 lead after four innings at Yankee Stadium and
improved its record to 60-40 on the season.  The Mariners fell to 43-59. Their franchise-record losing
streak is Major League Baseball’s longest since the 2005 Kansas
City Royals lost 19 games in a row.  The Yankees, who host the Mariners again today, trail the
first-place  Boston Red Sox  by two games in the American League
Eastern Division. The Red Sox had their four-game winning streak
snapped with a 3-1, 14-inning loss to  Kansas City  that ended at
about 2 a.m. today in  Boston .  The New York Mets evened their record at 51-51 by defeating
the Cincinnati Reds 4-2. The Mets scored four runs in the
seventh inning in Cincinnati and denied the Reds a third
straight victory when Jason Isringhausen struck out Brandon Phillips with the bases loaded in the ninth inning.  The San Diego Padres defeated Philadelphia 5-4, ending a
10-game losing skid against the Phillies. Aaron Harang allowed
four runs over six innings to outpitch Cliff Lee, and Chris Denorfia had San Diego’s first steal of home since 2005.  St. Louis beat Houston 10-5, Pittsburgh defeated Atlanta 3-
1 and the  Los Angeles Dodgers  topped Colorado 8-5 in yesterday’s
other National League games.  Texas routed Minnesota 20-6 last night in Arlington, where
the Rangers collected a season-high 27 hits and prompted the
Twins to use outfielder Michael Cuddyer as a pitcher in the
eighth inning.  Ian Kinsler had four hits, including a home run, and drove
in four runs for the Rangers (59-44), who extended their lead in
the AL West to four games over the Los Angeles Angels. The
Angels lost 3-2 to the Cleveland Indians last night.  Also in the AL, the  Chicago White Sox  beat Detroit 6-3 and
Oakland rallied past Tampa Bay 7-5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
