Krishnamurthy Harihar, a Mumbai-
based treasurer at FirstRand Ltd., comments on  India ’s benchmark
10-year bond yield in a phone interview.  The  Reserve Bank  of India raised the repurchase rate by 50
basis points to 8 percent today, a move predicted by none of the
22 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The yield on the 7.8
percent bonds maturing in 2021 was 8.43 percent as of 1:22 p.m.
in Mumbai.  “If you cut the chatter and go by statistics, costs have
gone up on commodities. On the other hand, interest-rate
transmission can take time and has maybe taken place only over
the last three months. And it is only now that we will see
deceleration of growth.  “I think the comfort zone from an economic standpoint will
be when the credit-deposit ratio on an incremental basis goes
back to 65 percent, which means that demand-side pressures will
abate.  “The 10-year bond yield can rise as high as 8.50 percent
to 8.55 percent in the next two months. The global scenario will
also play a part in determining where the yield will move.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
