German  government bonds  fell after
European Central Bank Governing Council member  Christian Noyer 
said policy makers remain in a mode of “strong vigilance,”
boosting expectations for further interest-rate increases.  Benchmark bunds snapped two days of gains and Euribor
futures fell, signaling investors are adding to bets for higher
borrowing costs. “The ECB council remains in a position of very
strong vigilance, without being predetermined about what we will
do” after this month’s interest-rate increase, Noyer said in an
interview according to Financial Times Deutschland.  “It’s clear the ECB is still in tightening mode,” said
Elwin de Groot, a senior market economist at Rabobank Nederland
in Utrecht,  Netherlands . “It could be one explanation for the
upward move in yields and we do see some flattening of the
curve.”  Ten-year bund yields rose two basis points to 2.78 percent
as of 9:19 a.m. in  London . The 3.25 percent security maturing in
July 2021 fell 0.165, or 1.65 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,449) face
amount, to 103.995.  Yields on two-year notes climbed three basis points to 1.36
percent. The difference between two- and 10-year yields narrowed
one basis point to 142 basis points, the least since July 12.  The yield on the Euribor futures contract expiring in March
2012 rose three basis points to 1.80 percent.  Spanish, Italian Spreads  Spanish and Italian 10-year government bonds advanced,
reducing the additional yield investors demand to hold the
securities instead of similar maturity bunds.  The yield on the Spanish securities was nine basis points
lower at 5.94 percent, narrowing the difference in yield, or
spread, to benchmark German bunds by 11 basis points to 315
basis points. The Italian-German  yield spread  was 14 basis
points tighter at 276 basis points.  German government bonds handed investors 1.6 percent this
year, compared with 3.3 percent for U.S. Treasuries, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Greek bonds have lost 9.5 percent,
while  Portugal ’s have declined 23 percent, the indexes show.  The Netherlands is due to sell as much as 3 billion euros
of bonds due in January 2015 and January 2028, while Italy will
auction bills and zero-coupon notes.  Spain  plans to sell 84- and
175-day bills.  Italy said yesterday it would cancel an auction of medium-
to long-term bonds scheduled for mid August “considering the
large cash availability and the limited borrowing requirement.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
