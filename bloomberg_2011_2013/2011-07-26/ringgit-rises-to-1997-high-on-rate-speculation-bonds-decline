(Corrects benchmark interest rate level in fifth paragraph)  Malaysia ’s ringgit rose to the
strongest level in almost 14 years after the central bank said
it is focused on taming inflation, spurring speculation interest
rates will be increased.  Bank Negara Malaysia Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz said
yesterday a lot of attention is being paid to dealing with
inflation because it erodes purchasing power. The Dollar Index,
a gauge of the greenback’s strength, retreated as Republicans
and Democrats failed to agree on a plan to raise the U.S.’s
$14.3 trillion debt ceiling ahead of an Aug. 2 deadline,
heightening the risk of a default.  Government bonds  declined.  “There’s still room for higher rates, not just in Malaysia
but across most economies in  Asia  that are still facing
inflation threats,” said Nik M. Khairul, a currency trader at
Asian Finance Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “We expect the U.S.
will do all it can to avoid a default or an economic crisis.”  The ringgit strengthened 0.6 percent to 2.9538 per dollar
as of 4:15 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 2.9509 today, the strongest level since
September 1997. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which
tracks the region’s 10 most-used currencies excluding the yen,
was set for its highest close since August 1997.  Malaysia’s consumer prices rose 3.5 percent in June from a
year earlier, the most since March 2009, the government said on
July 20. Bank Negara Malaysia kept its overnight policy rate at
3.00 percent on July 7, after lifting it once in 2011 and three
times in 2010. Policy makers next meet on Sept. 8.  Bonds Decline  Elsewhere in the region, The  Reserve Bank  of India
increased its benchmark rate today by more than economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast, while South Korea’s  Finance
Ministry  said the country will make an “all-out” effort to
contain inflation.  Three-year notes declined for a second day, pushing yields
to the highest in three weeks. The yield on the 3.434 percent
note due August 2014 climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 3.29 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  The government will auction 4 billion ringgit ($1.4 billion)
of April 2021 Shariah-compliant notes on July 28, according to
its sale calendar. It will also sell 2.5 billion ringgit of the
same notes in a private offering to investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
