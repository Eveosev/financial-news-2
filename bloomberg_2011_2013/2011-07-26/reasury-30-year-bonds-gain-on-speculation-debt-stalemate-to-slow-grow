Treasuries gained, pushing 30-year
bond yields down from almost a two-week high, amid speculation a
deadlock on raising the $14.3 trillion federal debt limit and
cutting the  budget deficit  will slow economic growth.  Benchmark 10-year note yields dropped from the highest
level in two weeks as Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said he
was told by credit-rating companies his deficit-cutting proposal
would not prompt a downgrade of  U.S. debt . Sales of new U.S.
homes unexpectedly declined for a second month in June. The
 Federal Reserve  purchased $3.1 billion of Treasuries.  “Most people believe that by passing the limit, it will
lead to some drag on the economy,” said  Ray Remy , head of fixed
income in New York at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc., one of
20 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “Nobody knows how
much. The biggest market concern is that they may do something
in a temporary way and kick the can down the road.”  Thirty-year bond yields dropped three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 4.29 percent at 12:24 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They earlier
approached 4.34 percent, the highest level since July 8. The
4.375 percent securities maturing in May 2041 advanced 18/32, or
$5.63 per $1,000 face amount, to 101 15/32.  Ten-year yields fell four basis points to 2.96 percent
after earlier reaching 3.04 percent, the highest since July 11.  Yields on two-year notes declined two basis points to 0.39
percent even as the Treasury prepared a $35 billion auction of
the securities today.  Home Purchases Fall  Treasuries also rose as purchases of new homes in the U.S.
unexpectedly dropped 1 percent to a 312,000 annual pace, a
three-month low, data from the Commerce Department showed today
in  Washington . The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists called for a 320,000 rate.  House Speaker John Boehner yesterday offered a two-step
plan to raise the U.S. borrowing limit by up to $1 trillion and
later by $1.6 trillion while requiring larger spending cuts.  Reid’s proposal, also made yesterday, would cut $2.7
trillion in spending and give President Barack Obama the full
$2.4 trillion in additional borrowing authority he seeks, enough
to get through the 2012 elections. Reid dropped Democrats’
insistence on tax increases.  The Nevada Democrat said today Boehner’s plan “gives the
credit agencies no choice but to downgrade U.S. debt” and that
the Senate will vote on his proposal soon. Both parties are
trying to round up votes for their proposals.  50 Percent Chance  Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  has said the U.S.
will run out of options to prevent a default on Aug. 2 unless
the borrowing limit is increased. The impasse in Washington has
increased the probability  Standard & Poor’s  will cut the U.S.
credit rating from AAA within three months to 50 percent, the
company reiterated July 21.  It cost more for the first time to insure U.S. Treasuries
for one year than for five years, as investors anticipated that
a failure to raise the debt ceiling will prompt rating companies
to declare the nation in default.  One-year credit-default swaps spiked to a record 80 basis
points today, according to BNP Paribas SA, up from 46 basis
points on July 22. The contracts exceeded five-year swaps by 23
basis points. Swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a borrower
fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  ‘Deep Economic Crisis’  President  Barack Obama  warned in a televised speech
yesterday in Washington of a “deep economic crisis” unless
Republicans and Democrats can agree on how to raise the
borrowing cap and rein in future spending. Boehner, an Ohio
Republican, who spoke afterwards from the U.S. Capitol, said
Obama was asking for a “blank check.”  The Fed’s purchase today of Treasuries due from August 2018
to May 2021 was the largest this month, according to data on the
New York Fed’s website. The central bank is investing the
principal payments from its debt holdings in Treasuries to help
spur the economy. It concluded on June 30 a program to buy $600
billion in U.S. debt to stimulate growth.  The central bank bought 29.5 percent of the securities
submitted by dealers today, also the most in July. The average
for the previous five purchases this month was 16.4 percent.  The two-year notes being sold today yielded 0.41 percent in
pre-auction trading, compared with a record low 0.395 percent at
the prior sale June 27. Investors bid for 3.08 times the amount
of debt available last month, less than the average of 3.39 for
the past 10 auctions.  Indirect bidders, the category of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 22 percent of the notes at the
June sale, the least since February 2008.  The Treasury is scheduled to auction $35 billion of five-
year debt tomorrow and $29 billion of seven-year securities on
July 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
