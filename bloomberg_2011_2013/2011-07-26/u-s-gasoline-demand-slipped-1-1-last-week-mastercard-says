U.S. gasoline demand dropped 1.1
percent from the previous week as the average pump price
increased, according to  MasterCard Inc. (MA)   Motorists bought 9.26 million barrels a day in the week
ended July 22, MasterCard said in its SpendingPulse report. That
was 2.6 percent less than a year earlier.  Averaged over four weeks, demand was down 1.3 percent from
the same period a year earlier, John Gamel, director of economic
analysis for SpendingPulse, said in the report. It was the 18th
consecutive week that the four-week average fell below a year
earlier, Gamel said.  The average pump price rose 3 cents from the prior week to
$3.69 a gallon. Prices are up 37 percent in a year.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the companyâ€™s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
