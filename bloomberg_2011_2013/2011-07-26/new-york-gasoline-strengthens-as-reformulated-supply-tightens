New York  gasoline rose amid tight
seasonal supply of the fuel in the region and after a compressor
was overloaded at PBF Energy Partners LP’s refinery in Delaware
City, Delaware.  Stocks of  reformulated gasoline, or RBOB, on the East Coast
totaled 16.8 million barrels for the week ended July 15, 19
percent lower, or 4.1 million barrels, than in the same period
last year, according to the Energy Department.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor increased 0.62 cent to 3.5 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:05 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery gained
4.17 cents to $3.1969 a gallon.  PBF released gases from its  Delaware  City oil refinery
after a gas compressor was overloaded, according to a notice by
the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental
Control.  The company has been selling finished product, including
gasoline, from the 182,200-barrel-a-day refinery, two people who
declined to be identified because the information isn’t public
said July 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
