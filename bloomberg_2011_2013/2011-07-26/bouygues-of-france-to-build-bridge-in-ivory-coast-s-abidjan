Bouygues SA (EN) , a French construction
company, will build a bridge in Abidjan,  Ivory Coast ’s
commercial capital, to ease congestion in the city, said Finance
Minister Charles Koffi Diby.  The crossing will cost 227 million euros ($329 million) and
will take two years to complete, he told reporters yesterday. It
will connect the neighborhoods of Marcory with Riviera and will
be 1,500 meters (4,921 feet) long.  To contact the reporter on this story:
