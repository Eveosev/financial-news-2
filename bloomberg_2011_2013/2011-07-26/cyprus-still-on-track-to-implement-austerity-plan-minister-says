Cyprus’s fiscal consolidation
package that the government agreed on with political parties on
July 22 remains on track to be implemented, Finance Minister
Charilaos Stavrakis said.  “The government is ready to implement it,” Stavrakis told
reporters in Nicosia today. “Part of what has been agreed is
the consultation of the president with the public-sector trade
unions on measures concerning them.”  Talks to finalize the package broke down today when
representatives of political parties at a meeting at the  finance
ministry  walked out in protest, lawmaker Nicholas Papadopoulos
said earlier.  “The minister of finance retracted from measures we agreed
at the meeting on Friday,” Papadopoulos, who is also vice-
president of center-right DIKO, the junior partner in Cyprus’s
government, said in an interview. Stavrakis “withdrew every
measure that angered trade unions.”  The revised version of the fiscal consolidation package the
finance minister presented today reduced budget cuts for this
year from 118.8 million euros ($172.3 million) to 97.5 million
euros and from 545.7 million euros to 268.5 million euros in
2012, opposition DISY party lawmaker Averof Neofytou said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
