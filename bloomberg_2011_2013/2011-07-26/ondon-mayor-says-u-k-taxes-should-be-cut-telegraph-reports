Mayor of London  Boris Johnson  has
called on the U.K. government to reduce National Insurance to
stimulate economic growth and abolish the 50 percent higher
income tax rate to send “a signal that London is open for
business,” the  Daily Telegraph  reported, citing comments by
Johnson.  “You should look at ways of stimulating consumption
confidence in the market,” Johnson said, according to the Daily
Telegraph. “That’s the right direction to be going in.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
