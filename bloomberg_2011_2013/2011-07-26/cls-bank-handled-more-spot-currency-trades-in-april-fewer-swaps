CLS Bank, the New York-based
operator of the largest currency-trading settlement system, said
it handled more foreign-exchange spot trades per day in April
compared with October, and fewer currency swap trades.  Average daily volumes in spot trading rose 9 percent in
April compared with October, CLS said in an e-mailed statement.
The average daily volume of currency swaps fell 7 percent over
the same period, it said. Volumes of outright forwards climbed
29 percent.  The average daily value of spot trades increased to $781
billion in April from $719 billion in October, CLS said. The
average daily value of swap trades settled fell to $704 billion
from $755 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
