The oyster herpes virus that has
ravaged shellfish populations on the French coast for the past
three seasons has killed about half of the country’s oysters
this year, a government notice showed.  Mortality on oyster farms on  France ’s Mediterranean and
Atlantic coasts ranged from 27 percent to 90 percent, according
to a Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries  alert  dated July 25
and published by the Paris-based World Organization for  Animal
Health .  French production of Pacific oysters fell 38 percent last
year to 80,000 metric tons because of Ostreid Herpesvirus 1, or
OsHV-1, according to Maryline Maingam, a spokeswoman for the
country’s  National Shellfish Committee .  “The event is unlikely to be contained and is now
considered to be endemic,” the world animal-health
organization, known by its acronym OIE, said in the statement
referring to the impact of the virus.  The disease drove up wholesale prices of Pacific oysters,
whose scientific name is Crassostrea gigas, by 20 percent in
2010, according to the  National Institute of Statistics  and
Economic Studies.  Mortality rates were lowest in the Bay of Veys in the
Calvados region on the  English Channel , with 27 percent of the
shellfish, known in French as huitres creuses, dying from the
virus. In the Salses-Leucate salt-water lagoon in the Languedoc
region on the  Mediterranean Sea , in the south of France, 90
percent of farmed oysters died, according to the notice.  The virus starts killing oysters when water temperatures
top about 16 degrees Celsius (61 degrees Fahrenheit).  To contact the reporter on this story:
