Argentina ’s central bank said the
 Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)  dropped legal actions against the country
under which it sought $600 million.  Bank of Nova Scotia filed a claim in 2005 for damages to
recoup its investment in Scotiabank Quilmes SA, the Argentine
unit that closed in 2002 following Argentina’s default on $95
billion in debt. Scotia Quilmes also ended legal action, the
central bank said today in an e-mailed statement.  The banks “desisted of all arbitral and judicial processes
against the state and the Banco Central de la Republica
Argentina,” according to the statement.  Bank of Nova Scotia spokeswoman Robin Harper didn’t
immediately respond to a telephone message seeking comment.  The banks claims are in connection with actions taken by
Argentina in 2001 and 2002, the press release said.  Argentina defaulted on a record $95 billion of bonds in
2001 and began restructuring the debt in 2005. Creditors holding
securities with a face value of $74.5 billion have accepted the
deals, according to a filing last year with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission.  To contact the reporters on this story:
