The Tokyo Stock Exchange, operator
of  Japan ’s largest equity market, is maintaining plans to sell
shares to the public and merge with its  Osaka  rival after profit
tumbled in the wake of the nation’s March 11 disaster.  “The profit drop won’t be a setback for the IPO,” Chief
Executive Officer  Atsushi Saito  said today at a news conference
in Tokyo. “We can’t ‘muddle around’ on the Osaka merger.”  He said media reports casting doubt on the exchange’s plan
to merge with Osaka Securities Exchange Co. were “made-up
stories” and declined to comment further on the deal.  Net income for the three months ended June 30 tumbled 39
percent from the same period a year earlier to 1.5 billion yen
($19.2 million), according to a statement on the  Tokyo 
Exchange’s  website . Lower income from IPOs and trading fees,
caused by a slump in the market following the magnitude-9
earthquake and tsunami, contributed to the drop, the statement
said. Operating profit slid 36 percent to 2.2 billion yen.  While Saito, who in March began speaking publicly about the
merger plan, prepares for the IPO, the Osaka bourse has said it
“can’t merge” if the Tokyo exchange sells shares to the public
beforehand, according to a Reuters report on June 6 that cited
Michio Yoneda, Osaka Exchange’s president.  Yoneda, at news conference today in Osaka, also declined to
comment on the merger.  To contact the reporters on this story:
