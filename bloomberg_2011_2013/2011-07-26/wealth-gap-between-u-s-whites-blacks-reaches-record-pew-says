Blacks and Hispanics in the U.S.
suffered bigger losses in wealth relative to whites during the
economic slump that ended in June 2009, pushing the gap among
the groups to a record, the Pew Research Center found.  The value of the median white households’ net worth, or the
difference between assets and debts, was 19 times greater than
that of black families at the end of 2009, the most since
comparable data began in 1984, according to  a report  by the non-
partisan research group. It was 15 times that of Hispanics, also
the biggest in at least 25 years.  “The bursting of the housing market bubble in 2006 and the
recession that followed from late 2007 to mid-2009 took a far
greater toll on the wealth of minorities than whites,”
researchers Rakesh Kochhar, Richard Fry and  Paul Taylor  wrote.
“Plummeting house values were the principal cause of the recent
erosion in household wealth among all groups, with Hispanics hit
hardest by the meltdown in the housing market.”  Geography played a role in determining the extent of the
damage done by the bust in real estate, because a
“disproportionate share” of Hispanics live in the states
showing the biggest declines in property values, including
California,  Florida ,  Nevada  and  Arizona , the report said.  From 2005 to 2009 inflation-adjusted wealth dropped by 66
percent for the median Hispanic household and by 53 percent for
blacks, the report said. White families saw a 16 percent
decrease during the same period.  Home equity accounts for a smaller share of net worth for
whites, “and that served to lessen the impact of the housing
bust” for the group, according to the report.  Owning Stocks  Additionally, a “much higher share” of whites than blacks
or Hispanics have stocks in their portfolios, mitigating the
blow from the housing slump. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
climbed 21 percent in the last six months of 2009.  “Given that a much higher share of whites than blacks or
Hispanics own stocks -- as well as mutual funds and 401(k) or
individual retirement accounts (IRAs) -- the stock market
rebound since 2009 is likely to have benefited white households
more than minority households,” Kochhar, Fry and Taylor wrote.  Nonetheless, Pew’s research showed the decline among whites
in absolute terms outstripped that of the other two groups.
Because the wealth base for white households is so much larger
than for blacks or Hispanics, the proportional decline in wealth
was less for whites.  Assets exceeded debt by $113,149 for the median white
household in 2009, down from $134,992 in 2005. For blacks, net
worth decreased to $5,677 from $12,124 four years earlier, and
for Hispanics it dropped to $6,325 from $18,359. The level for
blacks and Hispanics was the lowest since at least 1984.  Among Asians  The decline among Asians was even more precipitous,
according to the researchers. Median wealth for those households
stood at $168,103 in 2005, putting them at the top of the
rankings, and fell to $78,066 two years ago, according to the
data.  As with Hispanics, Asians lived in areas like  California 
that suffered most from the decline in housing, the report said.
In addition, the arrival of immigrants, who typically have less
wealth than their more established counterparts, contributed to
the decline, according to the study.  The findings were based on analysis of data from the Survey
of Income and Program Participation, a questionnaire that is
periodically distributed by the Census Bureau, the report said.  Pew researchers said it is considered the most
comprehensive source of data about household wealth in the
 United States  by race and ethnicity. Figures from the 2009
report were only recently made available.  Comparable Figures  In order to make the 2009 figures comparable to prior
years, the researchers adjusted the data from two years ago to
allow for the inclusion of Hispanics in the white and black
categories, consistent with Census Bureau methodology. Excluding
Hispanics from the racial groups, the ratio of white-to-black
net worth would have been 20 to 1 in 2009, the report said.  The gap has probably widened since as the housing market
continues to struggle while stocks have rebounded, the report
said. Home values dropped 7.8 percent from the end of 2009
through March, according to figures from S&P/Case-Shiller, while
the  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  climbed 19 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
