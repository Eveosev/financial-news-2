The  National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration  is seeking to limit the number of child deaths in
overheated cars after 21 perished so far this year.  Last year, 49 children under age 14 died of hyperthermia in
cars, according to a  report  from San Francisco State
University’s Department of Geosciences. About half of children
who died from heat stroke in cars from 1998 through 2010 had
been forgotten by caregivers, the school said. Other deaths were
caused by playing in unattended vehicles or youngsters left
inside intentionally.  “Not one of those children should have lost their lives in
this horrible way,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood
said in a  statement  today. “We need to do everything we can to
remind people to be vigilant.”  NHTSA officials met today with auto industry
representatives, car-seat manufacturers and consumer groups to
limit risk. Objects inside a vehicle can rise to 123 degrees
Fahrenheit (51 degrees Celsius) after an hour on an 80-degree
day, according to a  presentation  on the university’s website.
The agency plans to hold additional meetings.  Hyperthermia, or heat stroke, is the leading cause of non-
crash vehicle deaths for children under 14, NHTSA said.  Excessive heat warnings and heat advisories covered parts
of  Oklahoma ,  Arkansas ,  Missouri  and  Kansas  today, according to
the  National Weather Service . Yesterday’s high temperature in
Tulsa, Oklahoma, was 97 degrees, the first time in 11 days it
didn’t reach 100, according to the weather service.  Since June 27, the temperature has hit 100 more than 20
times in Tulsa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
