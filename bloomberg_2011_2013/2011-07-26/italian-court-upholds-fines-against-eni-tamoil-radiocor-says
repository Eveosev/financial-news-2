Italy’s high court upheld fines
totaling 315.4 million euros ($456 million) set by the country’s
antitrust regulator against oil companies  Eni SpA (ENI) , Tamoil SA,
Total Italia SpA, and Kuwait Petroleum Corp, Radiocor reported
without saying where it got the information.  The Rome-based Consiglio di Stato upheld a 2006 ruling by
the country’s competition authority, fining the companies for
anticompetitive practices in setting jet-fuel prices, Radiocor
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
