Nissan Motor Co.’s Chinese venture
plans to invest 50 billion yuan ($7.8 billion) by 2015 to gain
market share as economic growth boosts demand in the world’s
largest auto market.  Dongfeng Motor Co. aims to raise annual vehicle sales to
more than 2.3 million within five years from 1.3 million now as
it increases the number of dealerships in  China  to 2,400 from
1,400, Nissan said in a statement in Beijing today.  Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn , counting on growth in
China to help make Nissan Japan’s most profitable carmaker for
the first time since at least 1992, is aiming to boost its China
market share to about 10 percent by 2015, from its current 6.2
percent.  “Nissan has been doing very well in China in the past few
years on the popularity of models like the Tiida and Teana,”
said Ricon Xia, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ
Asset Management. “The Chinese market will play a much more
important role for Nissan in the future, as it has potential
like no other.”  Sales of the company’s Chinese-made vehicles more than
doubled to 563,078 last year from 203,537 in 2006, according to
the  China Association of Automobile Manufacturers . The carmaker
expects sales of the Infiniti luxury model in China to surpass
20,000 units this year,compared with 11,513 units in 2010.  Nissan, Japan’s second-largest automaker, plans to
introduce about 30 products in China by 2015, including a fully
electric car, it said in today’s statement.  Electric Car  China’s electric car demand will boom over the next five
years as more models are introduced and subsidies may be
expanded to more cities, Ghosn said in a briefing in Beijing
today.  “China is key to our total development plan,” Ghosn said.
“We believe we have potential to have a bigger market share in
China.”  Nissan estimates its global vehicle sales will rise 10
percent in the 12 months started April 1. By comparison, Honda
Motor Co. predicts a 6 percent decline and Toyota Motor Corp.
expects a 0.9 percent drop, as the two rivals have yet to resume
full production after  Japan ’s March 11 earthquake disrupted
their supply chains.  Moody’s Investors Service raised Nissan’s credit rating
today to Baa1 from Baa2, citing improved profitability,
financial flexibility and global market position.  “Nissan’s production has recovered faster than expected
and ahead of its peers,” Moody’s analyst Tadashi Usui said in a
report today. “Nissan will further and gradually improve its
credit profile by maintaining solid profitability.”  Income Forecast  Nissan targets operating income of 460 billion yen ($5.9
billion) in the year ending March 2012, while Toyota expects 300
billion yen and Honda estimates 200 billion yen. That would be
the first time for Nissan to beat its two biggest competitors,
according to Bloomberg data going back to 1992.  Dongfeng had the fastest sales growth among all Japanese
automakers’ ventures in the first half, with deliveries rising
12.9 percent from a year earlier. That compared with a 12
percent drop by Honda and a 19 percent decline by Toyota.  Wuhan-based Dongfeng Motor was set up by  Dongfeng Motor
Corp . and Nissan in June 2003 with a total investment of 16.7
billion yuan. Its products include Dongfeng-brand trucks and
buses as well as Nissan-brand sedans and compacts.  Nissan’s shares rose 1.5 percent to 864 yen in Tokyo
trading today before the announcements. The carmaker is
scheduled to report its first-quarter results tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
