Bulgaria  is considering filing a 61
million-euro ($88 million) claim against Rosatom Corp. in a
dispute over the construction of a 6.4 billion-euro nuclear
plant, Energy Minister Traicho Traikov said.  Atomstroyexport ZAO, a unit of Rosatom, said on July 22 it
has filed a 58 million-euro claim against Bulgaria to the
International Court of Arbitration in Paris for delayed
construction work payments. The National Electricity Company,
which supervises the project, said it may file a counterclaim
for unpaid purchases of old equipment.  National Electricity “will choose the best way to respond
to this claim when it receives an official notification of the
lawsuit filed by Rosatom,” Traikov told reporters in Sofia
today. “The company is preparing for several scenarios.”  Bulgaria aims to build the 2,000-megawatt plant at Belene
on the Danube River to meet growing energy demand as older
utilities are decommissioned. The project has been stalled since
a 2005 contract because of lack of funding and demands by
Rosatom for higher construction costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
