A successful resolution of U.S. debt
negotiations may leave the dollar under pressure because it
makes more likely a third round of Federal Reserve asset
purchases dubbed quantitative easing, BNP Paribas SA said.  “Even if a credible deal is struck that eliminates the
debt default risk and gets the support of the  ratings agencies ,
any support for the dollar could prove transitory,” a team of
foreign-exchange strategists including Steven Saywell in  London 
wrote in a research report today. The “market may soon after
conclude that the implied fiscal headwinds in 2012 either raises
the risk of the Fed enacting QE3 or at a minimum imply a public
commitment to a longer period of near-zero rates,” they wrote.  The dollar weakened 0.6 percent to $1.4469 per euro as of
11:43 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
