The  National Football League  will
repay its employees all wages and bonuses lost during the 4 1/2-
month lockout, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News.  NFL Commissioner  Roger Goodell  said in the letter that
salaries will be restored to previous levels, withheld bonuses
will be paid and employees will get a full payment to cover
income lost during league cutbacks.  The repayment will take effect as soon as the NFL’s next
pay period, Goodell said in the memo.  The New York Jets, Kansas City Chiefs,  Miami Dolphins ,
Detroit Lions and Buffalo Bills previously announced that they
will reimburse employees for team cutbacks and furloughs
instituted during the lockout.  Goodell, who received about $9.8 million in salary and
bonuses in 2009, and  Jeff Pash , the league’s chief negotiator in
the labor talks, each had his annual pay reduced to $1 during
the work stoppage. All other league employees had their salaries
cut by 12 percent.  The cutbacks -- for employees at the NFL’s New York
headquarters, NFL Network, NFL Films and NFL.com -- would have
increased to 25 percent if the lockout continued into August.
The shutdown ended two days ago when NFL Players Association
leadership voted to accept a new labor contract that previously
was approved by owners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
