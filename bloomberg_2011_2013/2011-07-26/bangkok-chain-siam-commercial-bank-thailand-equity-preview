Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  Thailand  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 4:30 p.m. close in Bangkok.  The SET Index fell 5.95 points, or 0.5 percent, to
1,121.63, halting an eight-day, 6.1 percent gain.  Siam Commercial Bank Pcl (SCB)  , Thailand’s fourth-
biggest lender by assets, dropped 2.4 percent to 123.5 baht, the
most since June 6. Chairman Vichit Suraphongchai may be selected
as Thailand’s finance minister by incoming Prime Minister
Yingluck Shinawatra, Post Today reported, without saying where
it got the information.  Yingluck denied Vichit had been approached for the job.  Sri Trang Agro-Industry Pcl (STA)  , Thailand’s biggest
publicly traded rubber producer, climbed 1.8 percent to 29 baht.
Global demand for natural rubber may expand 3.8 percent to
11.149 million metric tons in 2011, according to G. Palanivel,
Malaysia’s deputy minister of plantation industries and
commodities.  Thai Airways International Pcl (THAI)  , the country’s
largest carrier, declined 3.4 percent to 28.5 baht, the most
since July 12.  Thai Airways  will probably report a net loss of
7.9 billion baht in the three months ended June 30 on “weak
operation,” Nalyne Viriyasathien, an analyst at DBS Vickers
Securities (Thailand) Co., wrote in a note to clients today.  Rising fuel costs and slowing passenger demand affected the
company’s earnings in the second quarter, Raj Tanta-Nanta, Thai
Air’s vice-president for  investor relations , said by phone,
declining to give figures.  Thai Plastic & Chemical Pcl (TPC)  , a maker of plastic
materials, gained 1.7 percent to 30.25 baht. The company will
pay a cash dividend of 0.70 baht a share, it said in a
regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
