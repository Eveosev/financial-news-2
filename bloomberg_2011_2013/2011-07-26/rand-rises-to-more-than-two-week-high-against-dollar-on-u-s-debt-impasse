The rand advanced to its strongest
level in more than two weeks against the dollar after gold
climbed to a record yesterday and the deadlock among American
lawmakers over the debt ceiling spurred demand for alternatives
to the U.S. currency.  South Africa ’s rand appreciated as much as 1.4 percent to
6.6718 per dollar, the strongest since July 8. It traded 1.1
percent higher at 6.6911 at 4:06 p.m. in Johannesburg, a sixth
day of gains. The rand rose less 0.4 percent to 9.6857 per euro.  Gold traded within less than 1 percent of an all-time high
after President Barack Obama warned yesterday of a “deep
economic crisis” without a compromise to avert an Aug. 2
default. The dollar fell against all of its most-traded peers.  “Market fears over the U.S. debt situation are impacting
more on the dollar than risky assets,”  John Cairns  and Nema Ramkhelawan-Bhana, currency strategists at Rand Merchant Bank in
Johannesburg, said in a research note. “Global markets remain
jittery.”  Stocks fell today in  Europe  and early U.S. trading, while
gold traded at $1,613.30 an ounce, after climbing to a record
$1,626.30 yesterday. Gold and platinum account for 20 percent of
South Africa’s export earnings, according to government data.  South Africa’s relatively conservative fiscal and monetary
policies are attracting investors to the country’s currency,
Tradition Analytics researchers led by Johannesburg-based
Quinten Bertenshaw said in a research note.  “The dollar index is set to retain a bearish bias for now
and those currencies which offer reasonable returns without the
prospect of near-term fiscal trouble are likely to enjoy some
support,” Tradition said. “Investors are choosing not to look
at the dollar as the safe haven it was a month or two ago.”  Bonds Increase  The  Reserve Bank  has kept its benchmark  interest rate  at
5.5 percent since November, compared with near-zero rates in the
U.S. and  Japan . South Africa’s budget deficit will be unchanged
at 5.3 percent of gross domestic product in the year through
March 2012, Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said in February.  Foreign investors bought a net 669 million rand ($100
million) of South African bonds yesterday, adding to 1.37
billion rand of debt purchases last week, according to JSE Ltd.,
which operates South Africa’s stock and bond markets.  Bonds declined for a third day. The 10.5 percent notes due
2026 shed 10 cents to 116.74 rand, boosting the yield one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.53 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
