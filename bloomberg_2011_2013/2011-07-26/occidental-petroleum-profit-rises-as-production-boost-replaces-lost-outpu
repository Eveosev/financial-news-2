Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) , the
fourth-largest U.S. oil company, reported its largest quarterly
profit since 2008 as increased production in  Texas  and North
Dakota helped replace output disrupted by Middle East unrest.  Second-quarter net income rose 71 percent to $1.82 billion,
or $2.23 a share, from $1.06 billion, or $1.31, a year earlier,
Los Angeles-based Occidental said in a statement today. The
company was expected to report profit of $2.12 a share, based on
the average of five analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Occidental’s earnings surged due to higher crude prices
brought about by rising global demand and a civil war in  Libya ,
Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co. in  St. Louis ,
said in a telephone interview before the earnings were released.
The average price of crude futures on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  during the quarter rose 31 percent to $102.34 from a
year earlier.  “Crude prices are up and their volumes are up with recent
deals,” said Youngberg, who rates the company a “buy” and
doesn’t own shares. “Their chemical and trading operations have
also done well. All those things bode well.”  The company boosted oil and natural-gas production to the
equivalent of 715,000 barrels of crude a day in the second
quarter, a 2 percent gain from the prior year. Occidental said
the production increase came in part from recent acquisitions in
Texas and  North Dakota  that contributed to an 11 percent gain in
U.S. output, to 424,000 barrels a day.  Sales Rise  Sales rose 34 percent to $6.17 billion. The company said it
sold oil for $103.12 a barrel in the quarter, more than the
average price on Nymex, compared with $74.39 for the year-
earlier period. It sold gas for $4.27 per thousand cubic feet,
up from $4.19 in the second quarter of 2010.  Chief Executive Officer Steven I. Chazen, who took over the
top job May 6 from longtime CEO Ray Irani, has told analysts he
intends to focus more on U.S. production,  Paul Sankey , a
Deutsche Bank AG analyst in  New York , said in a June 1 note to
clients.  Civil war in Libya has cut the country’s oil production.
Unrest in Yemen has led to attacks on oil pipelines in the
Middle Eastern nation. Occidental reported no output from Libya
in the quarter, down from 14,000 barrels a day in the same
period last year. Production in Yemen also fell.  The earnings statement was released before the start of
regular trading in U.S. markets. Occidental fell 51 cents to
$107.37 yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
The shares, which have 16 buy and eight hold ratings from
analysts, have gained 9.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
