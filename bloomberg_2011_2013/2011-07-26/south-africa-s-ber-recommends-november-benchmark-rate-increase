The South African  Reserve Bank 
should raise its key  interest rate  in November as climbing
commodity prices, increased salaries and a weaker rand drive up
 core inflation , the  Bureau of Economic Research  said.  Inflation will average 6.5 percent in the fourth quarter
and the first quarter of next year, before dropping back into
the 3 percent to 6 percent target range, BER, based in
Stellenbosch near Cape Town, said in an e-mailed statement
today. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and oil
prices as well as electricity costs, was 3.5 percent in June.  The Reserve Bank kept its benchmark lending rate at a 30-
year low of 5.5 percent last week to protect the faltering
recovery of  Africa ’s largest economy. Some economists, including
those at Morgan Stanley, have pushed back their forecast for a
rate increase on expectations price pressures may ease.  “While a number of factors, including the muted rise for
core inflation and concern about global economic prospects, can
justify the Reserve Bank keeping the interest rate unchanged so
far, in our view there are arguments in favor of starting the
monetary tightening cycle before the end of 2011,” BER said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
