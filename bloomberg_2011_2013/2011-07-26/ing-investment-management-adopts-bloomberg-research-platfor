Press Release  First firm to use technology that grades trade idea performance  New York -- ING Investment Management has adopted Bloomberg’s
proprietary research management platform to share ideas globally
and track the effectiveness of trade ideas, Bloomberg and ING IM
announced today.  ING IM is the first investment firm to use the technology to
create a network for portfolio managers, buy- and sell-side
analysts to communicate and collaborate. The software enables
any fund management firm to build a customized and private
system, within the Bloomberg Professional service, to share and
distribute their proprietary research and stock calls throughout
their organizations globally. The new functionality is available
at no additional cost to firms who subscribe to the service.  The Bloomberg proprietary research management platform also
integrates directly with the analytical and desktop tools of the
Bloomberg Professional service. At ING IM, for example,
investment managers are notified immediately via the Bloomberg
message system when new trade ideas are generated or modified by
their analysts. ING IM can also easily analyze their own
research and estimates alongside broker and independent content
to gauge where they stand relative to consensus.  “Money managers face a highly-competitive environment and must
harness all of their firm’s talents and tools to produce the
best investment results for their clients,” said Jean-Paul
Zammitt, global head of product development for the Bloomberg
Professional service. “Now, ING IM can share analyst ideas,
evaluate performance and immediately identify whether trade
ideas have been successful or not.”  Patrick den Besten, head of ING IM’s Corporate Analytics-
Emerging Markets team, said, “Our research analysts now have one
simple, streamlined system. The Bloomberg Trade Ideas platform
means our research team can make sure that their best ideas and
latest thinking are known to all our fund managers immediately,
and that their successes are immediately recognized.”  For more information about the research or trade idea platform
