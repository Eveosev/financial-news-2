Russia ’s Micex Index declined for a
third day as U.S. President  Barack Obama  dueled with House
Speaker  John Boehner  over raising the country’s debt ceiling,
threatening the recovery in the world’s biggest economy.  The Micex gauge 30 stocks slid 0.3 percent to 1,722.11 by
the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, erasing an earlier gain of as
much as 0.4 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index increased
0.4 percent to 1,987.79.  Obama said yesterday the U.S. may experience a “deep
economic crisis” if leaders fail to reach a compromise and the
nation defaults, while Boehner said the president “wants a
blank check” to keep spending. European leaders’ agreement on
July 21 on a second bailout for Greece that includes
contributions from private investors failed to stem contagion
from the region’s debt crisis. Moody’s Investors Service
responded to the accord yesterday, saying it implied a default
for  Greece , and slashed the nation’s credit rating three steps.  “Russia remains hostage to global fears,” Slava Smolyaninov, deputy head of research at UralSib Financial Corp.,
wrote in an e-mailed report today. “Markets will again be
tested on their faith in a successful resolution of the debt
crisis on the both sides of the Atlantic.”  OAO Uralkali slipped 0.4 percent after OAO Acron Chairman
Alexander Popov said the company may sell a third of its 2.7
percent stake in Russia’s largest potash maker. OAO Novatek, the
country’s second-biggest natural gas producer, lost 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
