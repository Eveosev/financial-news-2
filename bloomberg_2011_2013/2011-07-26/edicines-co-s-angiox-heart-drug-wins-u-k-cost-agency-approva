Medicines Co. ’s Angiox can be given
to adults who suffer a form of heart attack known as an ST-
segment elevation myocardial infarction, or STEMI, the U.K.’s
medical-cost regulator said.  Angiox can be given with aspirin and clopidogrel to STEMI
patients who are undergoing primary percutaneous coronary
intervention, the  National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence  said in  guidelines  published today. The agency, also
known as NICE, rules on which treatments the U.K.’s  National
Health Service  will fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
