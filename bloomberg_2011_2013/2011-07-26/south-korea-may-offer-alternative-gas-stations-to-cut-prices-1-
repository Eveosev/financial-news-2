South Korea , relying on imports for
almost all its oil, is considering “alternative” gas stations
to promote competition and lower prices for petroleum products.  The government met today with executives from discount-
store operators and oil-products importers to discuss the
country’s oil-trading industry, the Knowledge Economy  Ministry 
said in an e-mailed statement.  “It needs to renovate the country’s oil-distribution
market, which will relieve citizens’ financial burden from high
 oil prices ,” the ministry said in the statement.  Oil refiners are among the companies that President  Lee
Myung Bak ’s government has pressured to cut prices to curb
inflation, which has exceeded the central bank’s 4 percent
target every month since January.  State-run Korea National Oil Corp. and other state
companies may purchase oil products abroad in bulk and supply
them to domestic distributors, the ministry said. The government
also is considering subsidies and other regulatory support for
retail operators to guarantee minimum returns on their
investments, the ministry said.  The government aims to increase alternative gas stations
for 10 percent of the nation’s overall network, the ministry
said, without giving timetable.  SK Innovation Co., GS Caltex Corp., the National
Agricultural Cooperative Federation and two other refiners
control 94 percent of the nation’s gas stations, the Korean
government said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
