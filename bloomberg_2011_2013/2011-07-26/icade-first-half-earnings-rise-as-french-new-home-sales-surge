Icade (ICAD)  SA, the commercial property
arm of France’s Caisse des Depots et Consignations, said profit
excluding items rose 23 percent in the first half on higher
sales at its homebuilding unit.  Earnings excluding disposal proceeds and other one-time
items, known as net current  cash flow , rose to 100.3 million
euros ($145 million), or 1.94 euros a share, the Paris-based
company said today in a statement. A year earlier, Icade earned
81.8 million euros, or 1.62 euros a share.  In February, Chief Executive Officer Serge Grzybowski
predicted “strong growth” in net current cash flow in 2011 as
Icade delivered homes and apartments it pre-sold in 2010. Sales
at Icade’s property development arm rose almost 20 percent, led
by its residential unit as low borrowing costs, tax breaks on
rental property investment and government subsidies to encourage
first-time buyers lifted demand.  Icade fell 17 cents to 83.32 euros in Paris trading. The
shares advanced 5.6 percent in the six months through yesterday,
lagging behind the 14 percent gain for an index of French REITs
compiled by Amsterdam-based Global Property Research.  To contact the reporter on this story:
