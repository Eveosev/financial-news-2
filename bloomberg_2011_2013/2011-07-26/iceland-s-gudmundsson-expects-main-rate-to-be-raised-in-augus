Iceland’s central bank Governor Mar Gudmundsson expects the country will raise its primary lending
rate in August as consumer prices accelerated to 5 percent this
month.  “We see that what we call  core inflation ” has been
“accelerating very fast in the past months, or about 1.5
percent since the beginning of the year,” Gudmundsson told
broadcaster  RUV . “This exceeds the bank’s inflationary target,
which might call for a reaction and the chance is that we’ll
react to some extent by raising rates.”  Iceland’s annual inflation quickened to 5 percent in July
from 4.2 percent in June, reaching its highest level in 12
months, the Reykjavik-based  statistics office  said in a
statement on its website yesterday. Consumer prices rose 0.1
percent from a month earlier, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
