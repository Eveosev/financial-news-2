TNK-BP advanced to its highest level
in more than a week after BP Plc’s Russian oil venture said
profit almost doubled in the second quarter on higher prices for
crude.  The company’s shares gained 0.9 percent to 90.04 rubles by
the 6:45 p.m. close, its highest since July 15.  Net income jumped to $2.11 billion from $1.16 billion in
the same period last year, TNK-BP said in materials handed out
before a media conference in Moscow today. Revenue rose to $15.4
billion from $10.5 billion a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
