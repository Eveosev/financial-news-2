The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars climbed versus the greenback after President Barack
Obama said the two sides of American politics are in a stalemate
on raising the debt ceiling.  The so-called Aussie reached $1.0902, the most since May 3,
before trading at $1.0890 as of 12:57 p.m. in Sydney, from
$1.0845 yesterday in  New York . New Zealandâ€™s currency advanced
to as high as a record 87.02 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
