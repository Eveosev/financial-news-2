Airbus SAS, the world’s biggest
maker of commercial planes, agreed to acquire U.S.-based Metron
Aviation to help build up a new unit focusing on air-traffic
management.  The deal is expected to be completed this year, the
Toulouse, France-based planemaker said in an e-mailed statement
today. It didn’t disclose financial terms and the planned
transaction is subject to regulatory approvals. Metro employs
about 200 people.  The acquisition is aimed at building Airbus’s strategy to
support air-traffic management programs that will improve global
air transport capacity.  Airbus is one of several companies working on the so-called
Sesar project or Single European Sky ATM Research, which seeks
to create a master air-traffic management plan for  Europe 
through 2020. Airbus’s new air-traffic unit, called ProSky, was
created in January of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
