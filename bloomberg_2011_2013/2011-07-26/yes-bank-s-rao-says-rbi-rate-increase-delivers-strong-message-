Shubhada Rao, Mumbai-based chief
economist at Yes Bank Ltd. comments on the  Reserve Bank  of
India’s decision to raise  interest rates .  The central bank increased the repurchase rate to 8 percent
from 7.5 percent and raised the inflation forecast for the year
ending March 31 to 7 percent from 6 percent, citing higher fuel
and food prices. Economists in a Bloomberg News survey forecast
a 0.25 percent increase in benchmark rates.  “Today’s rate increase effectively sought to calm
inflation pressures. In the absence of a correction in fiscal
expansion, the monetary policy has delivered a strong message of
handling inflation pressures.”  “The guidance from RBI seems to suggest that they are
keeping options open for further rate actions till such time
that inflation moderates to around 4 percent to 4.5 percent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
