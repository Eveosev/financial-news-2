Charterhouse Capital Partners LLP
funded its buyout of Environmental Resources Management Ltd.
with $525 million of leveraged loans, two people with knowledge
of the transaction said.  The financing includes a $425 million seven-year  term loan 
paying interest of 425 basis points more than the London
interbank offered rate, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the deal is private. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Banks including Credit Agricole CIB, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, Mizuho Financial Group Inc.,  RBC
Capital Markets  and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc.
provided the loans, the people said.  Charterhouse bought a majority stake in ERM from private-
equity firm Bridgepoint Capital Ltd. in a deal that valued the
London-based environmental consulting firm at $950 million,
according to the consultancy’s  website .  Gordon Bonnyman, executive chairman of London-based
Charterhouse, didn’t return a phone call seeking comment.  ERM’s clients include Ford Motor Co., BP Plc, Royal Dutch
Shell Plc,  Procter & Gamble Co . and Anglo American Plc,
according to its website.  Details of the financing are as follows:  To contact the reporter on this story:
