A tropical wave over the
northwestern  Caribbean Sea  strengthened “slightly” and has a
10 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within
48 hours, the National Hurricane Center said.  “Development, if any, of this system is expected to be
slow to occur as it moves to the west-northwest at 10 to 15
miles” (16 to 24 kilometers) per hour, the Miami-based center
said today in a website  advisory  at 2 a.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
