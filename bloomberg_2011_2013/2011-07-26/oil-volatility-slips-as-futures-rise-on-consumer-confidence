Oil options volatility slipped as
the underlying futures rose after U.S.  consumer confidence 
climbed from an eight-month low and as concern that the country
will default on its debt sent the dollar lower.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 27.9 percent at 1 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 28.7 percent yesterday.  Oil for September delivery rose 45 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $99.65 a barrel at 1:50 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices have climbed 26 percent in the past year.
Yesterday, futures fell 0.8 percent, snapping a four-day rally.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
September $90 puts, with 2,632 lots changing hands. They slipped
11 cents to 41 cents a barrel. September $105 calls, the next-
most active option, gained 3 cents to 83 cents a barrel with
1,746 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  December $80 puts were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 5,101 lots changing hands. They gained 2 cents
to $1.26 a barrel. The next-most active options, December $85
puts, rose 3 cents to $2.01 a barrel on volume of 4,407.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
45,501 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 43,729 and
December $125 calls with 41,301.  To contact the reporter on this story:
