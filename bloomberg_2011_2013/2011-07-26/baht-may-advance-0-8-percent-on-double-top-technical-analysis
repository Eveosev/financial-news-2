Thailand ’s baht will likely
strengthen 0.8 percent against the dollar this week after the
Southeast Asian currency surpassed a key technical level on July
22, according to Kasikornbank Pcl.  The baht may match a 13-year high of 29.46 reached in
November after the two currencies completed a so-called
“double-top” formation, which signals further losses for the
greenback, said Kobsidthi Silpachai, head of capital-markets
research at Kasikornbank in Bangkok. The double-top formation
was completed when the baht rose beyond 29.78 per dollar, a
level last reached on May 2.  “This formation tells you that the dollar tried to break
the top area against the baht twice already and has not been
successful, and therefore the momentum to move upward is running
out of energy,” Kobsidthi said in an interview today. “We will
probably meet substantial support for the dollar at 29.46
because we are going toward a territory where we have not been
since 1997.”  The baht gained 0.2 percent to 29.69 per dollar as of 3:03
p.m. in Bangkok and reached 29.67 earlier, the strongest level
since Nov. 12, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
