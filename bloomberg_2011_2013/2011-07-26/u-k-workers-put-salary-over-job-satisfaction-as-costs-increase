U.K. employees say higher pay and
benefits have overtaken job satisfaction as the most important
reason for switching jobs as they try to maintain their  living
standards , according to a study published today.  More than half, 54 percent, of respondents in a survey of
2,000 people said better pay and benefits are the main reason
for moving jobs, with 42 percent citing satisfaction at work,
the  Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development  said in an
e-mailed statement. In 2010, 61 percent job put job satisfaction
first, with 48 percent citing pay and benefits.  Since the start of the global financial crisis in September
2008, the  consumer price index  has risen at an annual average of
3.1 percent, more than twice as fast as the 1.5 percent increase
in average weekly earnings, Bloomberg data show. Almost a fifth
of survey respondents, 18 percent, said they regularly ran out
of money before payday, the CIPD said.  “The survey shows the ongoing impact of the economic
downturn in the workplace,” Ben Willmott, senior public policy
adviser at CIPD, said in the statement. “Employees are feeling
the squeeze as a result of pay freezes or low pay settlements
that fail to keep up with inflation.”  This year a total of 36 percent said their standard of
living had fallen over the previous six months, compared with 29
percent a year earlier. Keeping up with bills and financial
commitments is a “constant struggle” for 18 percent of
workers, the survey found.  To contact the reporter on this story:
