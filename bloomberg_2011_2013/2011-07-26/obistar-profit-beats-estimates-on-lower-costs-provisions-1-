Mobistar SA (MOBB) ,  Belgium ’s second-
biggest mobile-phone company, reported second-quarter profit
that beat estimates after almost reaching its full-year goal for
savings and lowering a provision for payments to Belgacom SA.  Net income dropped to 63.1 million euros ($91.4 million),
or 1.05 euros a share, from 63.9 million euros, or 1.06 euros, a
year earlier, the Brussels-based company said today in a
statement. Profit beat the 56.3 million-euro average of four
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales declined 1.5
percent to 419 million euros.  Mobistar’s mobile service revenue in Belgium, which is
under pressure from regulatory price cuts, fell 4.8 percent in
the quarter. That’s a recovery from a 5.8 percent drop in the
preceding three-month period. The phone company seeks to offset
the regulation with cost savings, which totaled 39.1 million
euros in the first half, and the October introduction of its
Starpack offering combining satellite television, telephony
services and broadband Internet.  “The company is doing a good job in terms of cost-cutting,
but this is not enough to offset all the negative elements and
we believe results will remain under pressure,” Nico Melsens,
an analyst at KBC Securities NV in Brussels, wrote in an
investor note. “The 50,000 TV net-adds target for 2011 seems
very hard to achieve now.”  Lower Provisions  Mobistar climbed 2.5 percent to 51.11 euros at the 5:40
p.m. close of trading on Euronext Brussels. The shares have
gained 5.4 percent since the start of the year, the fourth-best
performance among the 21 companies in the Stoxx 600
Telecommunications Index.  The Belgian unit of  France Telecom SA (FTE)  made little progress
in boosting subscriber numbers as net additions for the Starpack
bundle slowed to 4,119 from 7,322 in the first quarter and its
fixed broadband customers increased by 2,715 to 68,886. That’s
less than 2 percent of its mobile-telephony customer base in
Belgium.  Mobistar gained 9,900 Belgian mobile-phone subscribers in
the quarter, down from 17,600 in the preceding quarter. Its MVNO
partners including  Telenet Group Holding NV (TNET)  and Red Bull Mobile
gained 12,200 customers, based on restated figures for the first
quarter.  Cash Flow  Earnings got a boost from a decrease in writedowns of
doubtful receivables and from lower provisions for the payments
Mobistar has to make to Belgacom, the largest phone company in
Belgium, for providing social tariffs after the compensation
mechanism was annulled by court rulings.  Mobistar forecast both net income and so-called organic
free  cash flow  of 220 million euros to 230 million euros this
year, compared with a Feb. 9 prediction of 210 million euros to
230 million euros.  That compares with analyst projections for full-year net
income of 227.5 million euros, according to the average of 12
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company generated 151.7
million euros of cash not required for reinvestment in the first
half, a 24 percent drop from the same period a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
