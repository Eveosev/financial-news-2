AECI Ltd. (AFE)  said South African staff
and a community trust will get about 1.2 billion rand ($178.9
million) in shares, bringing ownership of  Africa ’s largest
explosives company by black investors to 27.4 percent.  The Johannesburg-based company also said it reached an
agreement to buy Kagiso Tiso Holdings (Pty) Ltd.’s 25.1 percent
interest in AEL Holdings Ltd., AECI’s explosives unit, in
exchange for shares valued at 397 million rand, according to a
stock exchange statement today.  This will enable AECI to meet South African ownership rules
that aim to boost black investors’ stakes in the nation’s
companies to help compensate for decades of disenfranchisement
under the apartheid system.  Profit for the six months through June rose 9.7 percent to
295 million rand as volumes rose and commodity prices increased,
the company said in a separate statement. The first-half
dividend is 78 cents, from 70 cents a year earlier.  Schalk Engelbrecht will take over as chairman from Fani
Titi at the company’s next annual general meeting in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
