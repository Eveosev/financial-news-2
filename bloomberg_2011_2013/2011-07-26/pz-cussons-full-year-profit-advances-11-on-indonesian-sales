PZ Cussons Plc (PZC) , the U.K. maker of
Imperial Leather shower gel, said full-year profit rose 11
percent as the company revamped its baby products in Indonesia.  Net income climbed to 70.4 million pounds ($115 million) or
16.29 pence per share in the year ended May 31, from 63.7
million pounds, or 14.72 pence, a year earlier, the Manchester,
England-based company said in a statement today.  PZ reformulated and repackaged some of its baby products in
Indonesia, where it has a 40 percent share of that segment,
according to Finance Director Brandon Leigh. In September, PZ
acquired sunless tanning brand St. Tropez, which has higher-
margin products less affected by raw materials prices.  “Our star was  Indonesia ; the growth there offset more
challenging conditions in  Australia ,” Leigh said in a telephone
interview. Australia and New Zealand sales were hurt by
discounting, as well as natural disasters such as flooding and
earthquakes, he said.  PZ Cussons may increase its average selling prices by 2
percent to 3 percent this year, due to higher raw materials
costs, Leigh said. Last fiscal year, costs rose as much as 8
percent on average, and the company boosted its prices about 5
percent, he said.  PZ is seeking beauty-products acquisitions in  Europe  to
complement the St. Tropez line, Leigh said. It’s also looking
for health-, beauty-, or baby-products deals in  Asia , though
nothing is imminent, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
