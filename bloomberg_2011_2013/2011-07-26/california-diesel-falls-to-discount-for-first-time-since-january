Low-sulfur diesel in California
traded below heating oil futures for the first time since
January on weak demand and a unit start at  Tesoro Corp. (TSO) ’s
refinery south of  Los Angeles .  Prompt-delivery, California-blend diesel in Los Angeles
weakened 4 cents, falling to a discount of 4 cents to heating
oil futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:08
p.m. East Coast time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The fuel hasn’t traded at a discount since January and hasn’t
traded this low since Jan. 15, 2010, when it dropped to a
discount of 5.25 cents.  California-blend diesel in  San Francisco  weakened 3 cents
to a discount of 3 cents. The fuel reached parity with futures
yesterday.  Tesoro’s refinery in Wilmington, California, is operating
at “normal, targeted levels” after completing a unit start,
Mike Marcy, a company spokesman based in Martinez,  California ,
said in an e-mail today.  The discount for prompt-delivery Carbob, California-blend
gasoline, in Los Angeles widened 2.9 cents to 20.65 cents versus
futures. The fuel fell 3.6 cents yesterday after  ConocoPhillips (COP) 
was said to have started a unicracker at its Rodeo, California,
refinery that was forced shut by a power dip over the weekend.  Carbob in San Francisco weakened 2.9 cents to a discount of
20.65 cents.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Portland , Oregon, widened 3.5 cents to 16 cents versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
