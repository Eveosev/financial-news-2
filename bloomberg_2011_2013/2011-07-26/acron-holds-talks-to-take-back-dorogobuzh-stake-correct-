OAO Acron, a Russian nitrogen
fertilizer producer, is seeking to take back a 14.3 percent
voting stake in its Dorogobuzh unit from Nordic Rus Holding, a
venture it shares with  Yara International ASA. (YAR)   Acron and Oslo-based Yara are in talks with  Russia ’s OAO
PhosAgro to reorganize the joint venture, Acron Chairman
Alexander Popov said today at a meeting in Russia’s Murmansk
region. Nordic Rus Holding owns 11.7 percent of the capital, or
14.3 of the voting shares, in Dorogobuzh.  The venture also holds 7.7 percent of the capital, or 10.3
percent of the voting shares, in PhosAgro’s Apatit unit.
PhosAgro is seeking to acquire the 10.3 percent stake from
Nordic, Popov said.  As a result of the reorganization, Acron and Yara would
receive funds for the shares sold in Apatit, Popov told
reporters, declining to elaborate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
