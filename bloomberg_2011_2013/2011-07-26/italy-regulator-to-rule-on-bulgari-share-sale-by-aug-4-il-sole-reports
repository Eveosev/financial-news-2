Italy’s stock-market regulator will
make a decision by Aug. 4 on a request by some  Bulgari SpA (BUL) 
shareholders for a review of the company’s sale to  LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported.  The investors want LVMH to increase its offer after the
French company paid a higher price for some shares owned by the
Bulgari family, Sole reported, without saying where it got the
