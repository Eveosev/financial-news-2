Croatia, which led southeastern
 Europe  in foreign direct investment before the 2009 global
recession, dropped behind neighboring  Serbia , a report by the
 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development said.   Foreign direct investment to the country that wants to
join the European Union in 2013 fell to $583 million in 2010
from $6 billion in 2008, making it third lowest in the Balkan
region in front of Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina with $293
million and $63 million in inflows, respectively, said Branko
Vukmir, a consultant at UNCTAD.  Serbia leads with $1.3 billion in foreign direct
investment in 2010, down from $4.2 billion in 2006, ahead of
Albania, with $1 billion, and EU member Slovenia, with $834
million, Vukmir, who was presenting UNCTAD’s World Investment
Report 2011, told reporters in Zagreb today.  “ Croatia  needs a thorough revision in its strategy
towards foreign direct investment,” Vukmir said. “There is
inertia and resistance to foreign investment, and our laws are
too complicated.”  The trend is likely to continue for Croatia through this
year, with first-quarter inflows in foreign direct investment
estimated at 129 million euros ($186 million), according to
Alen Skudar, the head of the statistics department at the
Croatian  central bank .  “These figures are low and it doesn’t look as if Croatia
will return to 2008 levels in the near future,” Skudar told
journalists in a joint briefing with UNCTAD’s Vukmir.  Croatia is struggling to recover from a recession as
consumption and investment continue to slump. Gross domestic
product shrank 0.8 percent in the first quarter, after
contracting 1.2 percent last year and 5.8 percent in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
