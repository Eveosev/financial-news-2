OAO Acron, a Russian fertilizer
producer, is in talks with investors to sell a stake of as much
as 49 percent in the Talitsky potash deposit as it seeks funds
to develop the project.  Acron wants at least $720 million for the stake, Chairman
Alexander Popov told reporters today in  Russia ’s Murmansk
region. State-owned development bank VEB is a potential
investor, Popov said, adding that other possible partners are
also conducting due diligence.  Capital spending  on developing the Talitsky deposit, in
Russia’s Perm region, is estimated at as much as $1.6 billion,
the company said in a presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
