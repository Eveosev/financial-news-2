Ace Ltd. (ACE) , the Swiss insurer
operating in more than 50 countries, gained the most in a year
after profit beat analysts’ estimates and the company boosted
its earnings forecast for 2011.  Ace advanced $2.50, or 3.8 percent, to $68.38 at 4:02 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The Zurich-based
insurer climbed 9.9 percent this year, compared with a 3.2
percent drop in the 75-company Bloomberg World Insurance Index.  Second-quarter operating profit was $2.01 a share, beating
the $1.65 average estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Premium revenue advanced on gains in Asia life insurance and its
crop-protection business, which the company bolstered through
acquisitions. Ace reported lower second-quarter catastrophe
losses than rivals Travelers Cos. and  Chubb Corp. (CB) , which depend
more on U.S. home insurance.  Ace is “well diversified, both geographically and by line
of business,” said Alan Zimmermann, an analyst at Macquarie
Group Ltd., in a note to investors yesterday.  The insurer raised its forecast on operating profit for the
year to a range of $6.00 to $6.20 a share from its projection of
$5.40 to $5.70 a share at the end of the first quarter.  Premium revenue climbed 16 percent from last year’s second
quarter to about $3.76 billion. Excluding the effect of currency
fluctuations, the figure increased 12 percent. Ace earned 7.4
cents for every dollar it collected in premiums for the quarter,
compared with 10.3 cents a year earlier.  “Given our second-quarter results and our momentum that is
frankly exceeding both the industry and our own plans, we are
quite bullish about the second half of the year,” Ace Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Evan Greenberg said during a
conference call with investors today.  Second-quarter net income fell 10 percent to $607 million,
or $1.77 a share. Natural disasters cost Ace $134 million in the
quarter, compared with $81 million in the same period last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
