The outlook for Burundi’s economy in
the “medium-term” is positive, though subject to the risk of a
possible deterioration in the political and security situation,

percent this year, while inflation may accelerate to 14 percent
by December, the Washington-based lender said in an e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
