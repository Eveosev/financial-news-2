Constellation Energy Group Inc. (CEG) , the
Baltimore-based owner of three nuclear power plants, said the
union at its Nine Mile Point nuclear station in New York voted
today to end a 17-day walkout.  Workers at the plant, located outside Syracuse, New York,
will begin to return to work tomorrow after approving a new
four-year labor agreement by a 395-64 vote, Constellation said
in a statement today.  The strike by the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers Local 97 was the first at a U.S. nuclear plant in eight
years, said Diane Screnci, spokeswoman for the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission’s Region 1 office in Philadelphia in an
interview July 8.  Nine Mile Point continued to operate during the work
stoppage, manned by management and non-union employees. Federal
inspectors provided additional oversight during the first two
weeks of the job action, Constellation said.  Union workers account for about 580 of the 1,050 total
employees at the 2,378 megawatt plant. Nine Mile is run by
Constellation Energy Nuclear Group LLC, a joint venture of
Constellation and France’s  EDF SA. (EDF)  Long Island Power Authority
owns 18 percent of one of Nine Mile’s two units, according to
Constellation’s  website .  The last strike at a nuclear reactor occurred in 2003 at
 Exelon Corp. (EXC) ’s Oyster Creek plant in Lacey Township,  New Jersey ,
Screnci said. It lasted 78 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
