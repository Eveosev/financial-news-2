Ghana ’s cedi appreciated for a
second day as mining companies sold dollars and traders
speculated the central bank’s first auction of five-year bonds
since 2007 will boost demand for Ghana’s currency.  The currency of the world’s second biggest cocoa producer
gained as much as 0.4 percent to 1.5042 per dollar, its
strongest intraday level since June 7, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It traded 0.2 percent higher at 1.5072 as
of 1:26 p.m. in Accra, the capital.  The  Bank of Ghana  will offer 300 million cedis ($199
million) of five-year bonds on July 28, it said on its website.  “Currency traders took positions in anticipation that the
bond auction on Thursday may weaken the dollar on offshore
investor inflows,” Chris Nettey, a currency trader at Stanbic
Bank Ghana Ltd., said in a telephone interview today. “Mining
firms also sold the dollar today to finance their cedi-
denominated activities.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
