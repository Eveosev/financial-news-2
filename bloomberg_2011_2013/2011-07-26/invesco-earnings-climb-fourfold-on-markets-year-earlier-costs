Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) , owner of the Invesco,
 Van Kampen  and PowerShares funds, said second-quarter earnings
rose as clients added more money and the company sought to
expand in Europe.  Net income rose to $183 million, or 39 cents a share, from
$40.8 million, or 9 cents, a year earlier when the firm incurred
costs from its purchase of Morgan Stanley’s mutual-funds
business, Atlanta-based Invesco said in a statement today.
Excluding some items, earnings of 44 cents a share beat the
average estimate of 43 cents in a Bloomberg survey of 17
analysts.  Invesco said it plans to spend $40 million by the end of
2012, including $5.8 million spent during the second quarter,
outsourcing its European transfer agency and restructuring
product and distribution efforts in  Europe . Chief Executive
Officer Martin L. Flanagan, 51, made growth in Europe a priority
earlier this year. Flanagan said in April he wants to expand the
European business by increasing cross-border retail and
institutional sales.  “As much as I like the cost savings, this is absolutely
about building the European business,” Chief Financial Officer
Loren Starr said today in a telephone interview.  Deposits Increase  Invesco rose 45 cents, or 2 percent, to $23.04 at 4:03 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It has fallen 4.2
percent this year, compared with the 7 percent decline in the
Standard & Poor’s 18-member index of asset managers and custody
banks.  Investors deposited $7.3 billion in the three months ended
June 30, including $3.5 billion in fixed-income funds and $2.6
billion in alternative products. Equity funds lost $2.6 billion
to investor withdrawals.  Invesco benefited from a surge in global stocks from
September through February. Measured by the MSCI AC World Index,
stocks rose 27 percent in the year ended June 30, boosting
client assets 17 percent to $654 billion, the company said in a
July 12 statement. Assets rose 1.8 percent in the second quarter
over the previous three-month period, the company said.  The higher assets helped boost revenue 36 percent from a
year earlier to $1.07 billion as investment management fees rose
31 percent to $819 million and service and distribution fees
increased 52 percent to $211 million.  Expenses Climb  Expenses climbed 17 percent to $837 million as third-party
distribution costs, the largest expense, rose 43 percent to $342
million.  The company repurchased 11.3 million shares for $280
million in the quarter.  A year after adding $115 billion in client assets through
the acquisition of the  Morgan Stanley (MS)  business, analysts said
Flanagan is still working to realize a boost to retail fund
sales directly from the takeover. The $1.37 billion deal
included a distribution agreement with Purchase, New York-based
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC.  “I don’t think today’s results echo that yet,” Daniel Fannon, an analyst at Jefferies & Co. in  San Francisco , said
today in a telephone interview. “We expect that to accelerate
in a more tangible way going forward.”  Invesco’s earnings a year ago were reduced by $64.5
million, after taxes, due to costs associated with the Morgan
Stanley purchase.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest money manager, said
July 20 that second-quarter profit climbed 43 percent to $619
million. The New York firm reported a net $15.5 billion in
investor withdrawals while market gains helped assets under
management increase by 0.3 percent to $3.66 trillion.  Janus Capital Group Inc. (JNS) , based in Denver, said July 21
that net income increased 39 percent to $41.9 million, or 23
cents a share, while recording its eighth straight quarter of
redemptions as investors withdrew $3.1 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
