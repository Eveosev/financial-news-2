Vishnu Varathan, an economist at
Capital Economics (Asia) Pte in Singapore, comments on the
 Reserve Bank  of India’s decision to raise  interest rates  at a
policy review today. The central bank increased its repurchase
rate to 8 percent from 7.5 percent and boosted its reverse
repurchase rate to 7 percent from 6.5 percent.  “There is no clear sign that the RBI has frontloaded the
interest-rate hikes and they are done with it. They are willing
to be very, very flexible about it and take a U-turn if
necessary, but for now they will watch all the indicators. The
risk is they may tighten policy further in the next few months
if we see no major downside risks to growth.  “The RBI continues to be very, very focused on broadening
price pressures, on signs that demand-pull risks remain quite
high. The RBI feels there has not been a broad-based growth
slowdown, that’s why they have moved with a 50 basis-point
increase.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
