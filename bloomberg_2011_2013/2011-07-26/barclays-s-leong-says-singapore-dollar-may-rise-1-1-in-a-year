Wai Ho Leong, senior regional
economist at  Barclays Capital  in  Singapore , comments on the
outlook for the Singapore dollar in a research note released
today after the government reported industrial production rose
for the first time in three months in June.  The U.K. bank forecasts the currency will strengthen 1.1
percent to S$1.19 per dollar in 12 months.  “Against the backdrop of upside inflation risks but
moderating growth, we believe the Monetary Authority of
Singapore will maintain its current stance of gradual
appreciation of the Singapore dollar’s nominal effective
exchange rate in its October policy statement.  “If MAS core inflation consistently surprises on the
upside, we believe there is an outside chance that MAS may
tighten policy further by re-centering the  Singapore dollar ’s
NEER band upwards.  “We expect growth to moderate to 4.5 percent in 2012 as
the effects of tighter monetary conditions and weaker external
demand are felt. However, the moderation is likely to be in the
form of a soft landing, as growth remains broad-based in general
and of higher quality due to a tight labor market.  “On a full-year basis, we believe the economy is still on
track to achieve our GDP growth forecast of 6.0 percent in
2011.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
