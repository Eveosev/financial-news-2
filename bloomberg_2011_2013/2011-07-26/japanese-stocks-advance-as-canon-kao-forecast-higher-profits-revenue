The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose
for the fourth time in six days as forecasts for higher earnings
at companies from Canon Inc. to  Kao Corp. (4452)  outweighed concern
that the U.S. will default on its debt.  Canon and Kao jumped at least 2.6 percent after saying
Japan’s record earthquake on March 11 had less impact on
earnings than expected. Tokyo Electric Power Co. led utilities
lower after the Nikkei newspaper reported fuel costs at power
companies will probably increase because of a prolonged shutdown
of the country’s nuclear power plants.  “Companies thought the recovery from the quake would take
longer, but earnings are coming back quickly,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , who helps oversee $6 billion at Shinkin Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo. “More and more companies will raise
earnings forecasts even after factoring in the impact from the
yen’s rise.”  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  rose 0.5 percent to 10,097.72 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo. The broader Topix climbed 0.5 percent to 866.20
after companies from Canon to Kao raised profit forecasts to
start off Japan’s first-quarter earnings season.  More than 550 of the 1,667 companies listed on the Topix
are scheduled to report results this week. Since July 11, 14 of
the 95 companies that released quarterly results beat analyst
estimates, while nine missed estimates, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Canon, Kao  Canon rose 2.6 percent to 3,885 yen after yesterday saying
full-year net income may total 260 billion yen ($3.3 billion).
The forecast was 18 percent higher than the company predicted in
April after an earthquake and tsunami devastated  Japan ’s
northeast coast and disrupted supply chains.  “The company’s response to the earthquake was quick and
efficient,” Deutsche Bank AG said in a note to clients,
reiterating its “buy” rating on the maker of cameras and copy
machines.  Kao climbed 4.7 percent to 2,262 yen, the biggest gain on
the Nikkei 225, after boosting its net income outlook 7.5
percent to 57 billion yen this fiscal year. Sales are expected
to expand in Asian countries, the company said.  “Investors increasingly expect good earnings and that will
probably encourage them to buy stocks,”  said  Ryuta Otsuka , a
strategist at Toyo Securities Co. in Tokyo.  U.S. Debt Stalemate  Japanese stocks added to gains even amid a stalemate in the
U.S. congress on negotiations for raising the federal debt limit
and avoiding a government default. The dollar fell against the
yen and gold advanced after President  Barack Obama  said failure
to raise the government’s borrowing authority “would risk
sparking a deep economic crisis.”  Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Japan’s largest gold producer by
market value, gained 1.6 percent to 1,394 yen as futures on the
precious metal extended gains in  New York  today after yesterday
touching a record $1,626.30 per ounce. Smaller rival Mitsubishi
Materials Corp. rose 1.5 percent to 263 yen.  Among stocks that declined, Tokyo Electric led utilities
lower after a Nikkei report that fuel costs at Japan’s top five
power companies will likely increase by about 2 trillion yen.
The utilities, which halted nuclear plants after the March
earthquake, have become more dependent on thermal plants, the
report said.  Tokyo  Electric sank 4.3 percent to 512 yen, dropping by the
most on the Nikkei 225. Chubu Electric Power Co., Japan’s third-
largest utility by revenue, lost 1.1 percent to 1,420 yen.
Tohoku Electric Power Co., the No. 4, slid 1.3 percent to 1,069
yen.  NTN Corp., NSK Ltd., Jtekt Corp. and Nachi-Fujikoshi Corp.
fell after Jiji Press today reported that Japan’s Fair Trade
Commission investigated the bearing-makers for price fixing.  NTN slumped 3.9 percent to 467 yen. NSK, which said in a
statement it is cooperating with the probe, sank 3.7 percent to
775 yen. Jtekt slid 2.9 percent to 1,193 yen, while Nachi-
Fujikoshi tumbled 5.7 percent to 526 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
