Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc., the
operator of Dunkin’ Donuts coffee shops, raised $422.8 million
in its U.S. initial public offering, pricing its shares above
the top end of the marketed range.  The Canton, Massachusetts-based company sold 22.3 million
shares at $19 each yesterday, according to a statement, after
offering them for $16 to $18. The shares will trade today on the
Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol DNKN, it said.  Dunkin’s IPO is one of 12 planned in the U.S. this week,
the biggest number of weekly deals since November 2007,
Bloomberg data show. The doughnut seller enticed investors with
plans to more than double its U.S. locations in 20 years, after
outpacing  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) ’s revenue growth last year.  Dunkin’ planned to use the proceeds from its IPO to repay
debt accumulated under the ownership of private-equity firms
Bain Capital LLC,  Carlyle Group  and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP,
according to its regulatory filing. The firms paid about $2.43
billion for the company in a 2006 leveraged buyout.  At the end of March, Carlyle marked its investment at 1.55
times, it said in a letter to investors, putting the enterprise
value of the company at $3.5 billion, including $1.8 billion in
long-term debt. All three firms planned to sell shares in the
IPO, according to the prospectus, each cutting their stake to 26
percent from about 32 percent.  Emerging From Buyouts  The biggest U.S. IPOs this year have been brought by
private-equity firms. HCA Holdings Inc., the hospital chain
partly owned by KKR & Co. and Bain, raised $4.4 billion in March
in the biggest-ever private equity-backed IPO, according to
London-based Preqin Ltd. Kinder Morgan Inc., the energy-pipeline
company whose owners include Carlyle, raised $3.3 billion in its
February IPO.  At the IPO price, Dunkin’s market capitalization is about
$2.4 billion. Completion of the IPO would leave the company with
about $1.48 billion of long-term net debt and $56.6 million of
cash, according to the IPO prospectus, giving it an enterprise
value of about $3.82 billion. That’s about 57 percent higher
than the private-equity firms paid when they bought Dunkin’ from
Pernod Ricard SA.  The $2.4 billion market cap values Dunkin’ at about 4.1
times trailing 12-month sales, compared with 2.7 times for
 Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  based on its closing share price yesterday.  New Locations  In the U.S., where it has about 6,800 points of
distribution, mostly in  New England  and  New York , Dunkin’ plans
to open as many as 250 new locations per year in 2011 and 2012,
with a goal of 15,000. The chain has about 9,800 global
locations. Dunkin’ also franchises about 6,500 Baskin-Robbins
ice cream shops globally, its filing showed.  Revenue at Dunkin’ last year jumped 7.3 percent, compared
with 5.8 percent at McDonald’s, the world’s biggest restaurant
chain, which serves the McCafe line of coffees.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  led the Dunkin’
offering. Underwriters have an option to buy an additional 3.3
million shares within 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
