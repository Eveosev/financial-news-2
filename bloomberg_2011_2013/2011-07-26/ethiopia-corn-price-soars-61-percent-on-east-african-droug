Corn prices have soared 61 percent
in the Ethiopian capital,  Addis Ababa , from this time last year,
the partly U.S.-funded Famine Early Warning Network Systems
said.  The price of corn is also 56 percent higher than the five-
year average, the organization, known as Fewsnet, said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Since Ethiopiaâ€™s 2004-2005 farming season the price of 100
kilograms (220 pounds) of corn has climbed from about 140 birr
($8) to about 780 birr, said Fewsnet.  Relief organizations provided food to about 3.2 million out
of the targeted 4 million facing shortages, Fewsnet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
