China ’s money-market rate declined
for a third day on speculation a cash shortage is easing as the
central bank reins in efforts to drain funds from the financial
system.  The People’s Bank of China didn’t offer any repurchase
agreement today, according to a statement on Chinabond, the
nation’s biggest debt clearing house. The seven-day repurchase
rate, a gauge of interbank funding availability, also declined
as some smaller banks got a portion of their reserve-requirement
payments back from the central bank yesterday to reflect their
shrinking deposits, according to Shi Lei, a bond analyst at Ping
An Securities Co., a unit of the nation’s second-biggest
insurance company.  “The cash shortage is improving as the central bank drains
less capital,” said Beijing-based Shi. “Cash supply will
improve more later this week as a total of 34 billion yuan of
central bank bills and repos will mature on Thursday and
Friday.”  The seven-day repo dropped 25 basis points to 5.03 percent
as of the 4:30 p.m. close in  Shanghai , after sliding 65 basis
points in the last two trading days, according to a weighted
average rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The central bank kept the yield on one-year bills unchanged
at 3.4982 percent for a fourth week, according to a statement on
Chinabond. It issued 1 billion yuan ($155 million) of the
securities, the least in more than a month.  Chinese banks meet reserve-requirement ratios by parking
more funds with the People’s Bank of China on the 5th, 15th and
25th of each month if their deposit holdings expand. They get
refunds if their deposits decline.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, climbed two
basis point to 4.24 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 4.31 percent on July 22, the highest level
in Bloomberg data going back to 2006.  The yield on the 3.48 percent government bond due July 2012
was unchanged at 3.80 percent, according to the Interbank
Funding Center.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: James Regan, Andrew Janes  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
