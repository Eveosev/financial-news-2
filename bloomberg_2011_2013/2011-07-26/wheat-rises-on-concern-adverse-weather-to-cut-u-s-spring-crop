Wheat rose on concern that heavy
rain in the northern U.S. Great Plains will reduce production.  In the week ended July 24, about 83 percent of spring wheat
was beginning to form  grain , compared with an average of 95
percent in the past five years, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said yesterday. An estimated 74 percent of the crop
was in good or excellent condition, down from 83 percent a year
earlier, the USDA said.  “The best shot wheat has at going higher is a weather
problem,”  Jeff McReynolds , the owner of McReynolds Marketing &
Investments in Hays,  Kansas , said in a telephone interview.
“There has to be some threat to supply in order for wheat to go
up.”  Wheat futures for September delivery rose 5.5 cents, or 0.8
percent, to close at $6.94 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. The most-active contract has gained 18 percent
in the past year.  Earlier, the price dropped as much as 1.3 percent as
cheaper supplies from  Russia  eroded the appeal of shipments from
the U.S., the world’s leading exporter.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $13
billion in 2010, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
