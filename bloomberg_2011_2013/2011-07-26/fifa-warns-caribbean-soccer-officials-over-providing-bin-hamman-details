Caribbean soccer officials may face
sanctions from FIFA if they fail to provide requested
information concerning a meeting which led to the lifetime
suspension of Mohamed  Bin Hammam .  Bin Hammam was banned by soccer’s governing body three days
ago over charges of bribing Caribbean Football Union voters in
an attempt to win a FIFA presidential election. FIFA yesterday
sent a letter to all CFU members stating that anyone with
knowledge of what took place at the meeting had 48 hours to
provide “relevant information.”  “Any person who has relevant information but does not come
forward during this 48-hour period will be subject to the full
range of sanctions,” FIFA said in an email.  FIFA’s said its ethics committee, which suspended Bin
Hammam, will open necessary proceedings at the end of the 48-
hour period.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
