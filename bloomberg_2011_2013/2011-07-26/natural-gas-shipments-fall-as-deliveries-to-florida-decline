Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators dropped as shipments to Florida
declined.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments fell 6.7 percent to 20 million
dekatherms (19.5 billion cubic feet) from 21.5 million
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Schedules
for 689 of 742 pipelines had been reported as of 8:55 a.m.  Scheduled shipments to power generators in Florida dropped
1.2 percent to 3.3 million dekatherms, with all 80 pipelines in
the region having reported deliveries.  Temperatures in Florida will be in a normal range through
July 30, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,
 Maryland .  Power plants use about 30 percent of the nationâ€™s gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  Wholesale gas for next-day delivery at Florida Gas
Transmission Zone 3 gained 3.06 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$4.4942 per million British thermal units yesterday on the
Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
slid 1.21 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $4.449 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
