First Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB) , the United
Arab Emirates’ lender controlled by  Abu Dhabi ’s ruling family,
sold $650 million of Islamic bonds, according to two bankers
familiar with the transaction.  The five-year sukuk was priced to yield 200 basis points
above the benchmark mid-swap rate, said bankers, who declined to
be identified because the details are private.  First Gulf Bank is selling the bonds under a $3.5 billion
sukuk program. Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and Standard
Chartered Plc managed the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
