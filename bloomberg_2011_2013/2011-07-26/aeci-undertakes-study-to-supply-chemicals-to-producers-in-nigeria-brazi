AECI Ltd. (AFE) , a South African
specialty-chemical manufacturer, said it’s evaluating ways to
supply products to the manufacturers of fast-moving consumer
goods in  Nigeria  and Brazil.  The company has commissioned a study on the two markets
with the Frost & Sullivan consulting company, Schalk Venter, an
AECI executive leading the Nigerian project, said today after an
earnings presentation to shareholders and analysts in
Johannesburg.  “We see Nigeria as important to our Africa growth, with
its large consumer market, a developing middle class and a
stable government,” Venter said. Results from the Nigerian
study will probably be ready in four to six weeks.  AECI, Africa’s largest explosives maker, said a year ago
that it’s considering acquisitions in the mining-chemical,
energy and water-treatment industries to expand its product
line. The Johannesburg-based company is studying how to become a
chemical and raw-material supplier to  Brazil ’s and Nigeria’s
food-additive and personal- and home-care markets as well as for
farming, water treatment, and oil and gas, Venter said.  In  South Africa , a strike in the coal industry that may
spread to gold and platinum mines will affect AECI’s business in
the second half of the year, Chief Executive Officer Graham
Edwards said at today’s presentation. The company reported a 9.7
percent increase in first-half net income to 295 million rand
($44 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
