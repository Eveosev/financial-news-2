Crude oil rose after U.S. consumer
confidence climbed from an eight-month low and as concern the
country will default on its debts sent the dollar lower.  Futures increased 0.4 percent as the Conference Board’s
index rose to 59.5 in July from a revised 57.6 reading the prior
month. President  Barack Obama  cautioned of a “deep economic
crisis” without a compromise to avert an Aug. 2 default. The
dollar dropped on the warning, bolstering the appeal of dollar-
denominated raw materials such as oil.  “The consumer confidence number gave us a good bounce,”
said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics LLC in
Austin,  Texas . “You’re getting a lot of intraday movement but
the net change isn’t that great.”  Crude oil for September delivery rose 39 cents to settle at
$99.59 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract reached $100.62, the highest intraday price since June
10. Futures have increased 26 percent in the past year.  Prices retreated after the  American Petroleum Institute 
reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S. crude-oil stockpiles climbed
3.96 million barrels to 358.2 million. September oil fell 3
cents to $99.17 a barrel in electronic trading at 4:32 p.m.  Brent oil for September settlement climbed 34 cents, or 0.3
percent, to end the session at $118.28 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European benchmark
contract traded at a premium of $18.69 a barrel to West Texas
Intermediate, the grade traded in New York, down from a record
$22.63 on July 14, based on settlement prices.  Dueling Speeches  Obama delivered his message last night in a prime-time
television address from the White House, a ritual in moments of
crisis and national tragedy. Republican House Speaker  John Boehner , speaking from the U.S. Capitol, responded that the
president “wants a blank check” to continue  government
spending  that is “sapping the drive of our people.”  Failure to raise the nation’s $14.3 trillion debt ceiling
quickly would act as a new tax on the economy,  Alice Rivlin , a
White House budget director under President  Bill Clinton , said
in an interview on Bloomberg Television today.  “There’s a new tension to the market,” said  Tim Evans , an
energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “The
bullish spin is that the debt issue will weaken the dollar and
is therefore good for commodities. The bearish spin is that a
failure to raise the debt ceiling will be bad for demand and any
austerity measures in an agreement will also hurt demand.”  New York crude has gained 9 percent this year as the Dollar
Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six trading
partners, has declined 7 percent. The dollar fell 1 percent to
$1.4517 against the euro, and touched $1.4358, the lowest level
since July 5. It slipped to a record low versus the Swiss franc.  Commodity Rally  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials rose
0.6 percent to 701.53, the highest level since June 10. Twenty-
one of the commodities advanced.  “Commodities are going to move higher and the dollar lower
until we have clarity about the budget impasse,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The focus has shifted from the problems
in  Europe  to instability here.”  An Energy Department report tomorrow will probably show
that U.S. crude oil inventories slipped 2 million barrels, or
0.5 percent, to 349.7 million last week, according to the median
of 13 analyst responses in a Bloomberg News survey. It would be
the eighth straight fall, the longest stretch of declines in
more than three years.  Fuel Inventories  Gasoline stockpiles increased 400,000 barrels, or 0.2
percent, to 212.9 million in the week ended July 22, the survey
showed. Supplies of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, probably rose 1.63 million barrels, or
1.1 percent, to 150.1 million barrels.  Gasoline for August delivery gained 2.72 cents, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $3.1536 a gallon on the Nymex. Prices have
risen 50 percent in the past year.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 535,400
contracts as of 4:32 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 409,714
contracts yesterday, the lowest in three months and 39 percent
below the average of the past three months. Open interest was
1.5 million contracts, the lowest level since January.  “Volume is very low right now, which is adding to the
volatility,” Evans said. “It doesn’t take much to move the
market now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
