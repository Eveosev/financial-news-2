The cost to protect against a
default by  Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. (HOV)  rose to the highest since
April 2009 after reports today signaled housing is still
languishing two years into the U.S. economic recovery.  Five-year credit-default swaps on the  Red Bank , New Jersey-
based homebuilder increased 2 percentage points to 42.8 percent
upfront, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market. That means it would cost $4.28 million initially and
$500,000 annually to protect $10 million of Hovnanian’s debt.  U.S. home purchases dropped 1 percent to a 312,000 annual
pace, a three-month low, figures from the Commerce Department
showed today in  Washington . The median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of economists called for a 320,000 rate. A separate
report from S&P/Case-Shiller showed  home prices  in 20 U.S.
cities dropped 4.5 percent in May from the same month last year
The year-over-year decrease was the biggest since November 2009.  Hovnanian’s $797 million of 10.625 percent notes due in
October 2016 fell 0.4 cent to 95.13 cents on the dollar at 4:44
p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The notes
have dropped from 110 cents in February.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporters on this story:
