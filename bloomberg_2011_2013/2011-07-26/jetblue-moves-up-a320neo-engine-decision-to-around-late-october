JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU)  moved up to
about late October from year-end the date for choosing an engine
manufacturer for Airbus SAS A320neos it ordered, Chief Executive
Officer Dave Barger said.  “It will be well before the end of the year,” Barger said
in an interview today. “We’re looking at about 100 days from
now.”  JetBlue announced a $2.5 billion order for 40 neos at the
 Paris Air Show  on June 21, and said then it would decide what
engine to use by the close of 2011. It will choose between
 United Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s Pratt & Whitney and  CFM
International , a joint venture of  General Electric Co. (GE)  and
 Safran SA (SAF)  of France.  JetBlue fell 45 cents, or 8.5 percent, to $4.83 at 4 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, its lowest price
since February 2010. The decline came after JetBlue said second-
quarter profit fell 19 percent to $25 million, or 8 cents a
share. Analysts predicted 9 cents, the average of 15 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  The New York-based airline’s fleet planners spent time
visiting with GE’s aviation unit outside of Cincinnati and
United Technologies’ Pratt, based in  East Hartford , Connecticut,
about engine options before the aircraft order was announced,
Barger said.  JetBlue’s current A320 jets have engines made by
International Aero Engines, a venture led by Pratt and Rolls-
Royce Holdings Plc, while its  Embraer E190s  have engines made by
GE.  The airline also said today it reached an agreement to sell
delivery slots for 11 E190s it was to receive in 2013 and 2014,
without identifying the buyer. The sale follows JetBlue’s June
decision to pare to 75 from 100 the number of 100-seat E190s it
will fly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
