Books-A-Million Inc. (BAMM)  said it
withdrew its bid to buy 30 Borders Group Inc. stores after the
companies failed to agree on terms and going-out-of-business
sales at the locations had already started.  “We worked exhaustively in an effort to acquire these
stores and reach agreements with all of the parties whose
consent was necessary,” Books-A-Million Chief Executive Officer
Clyde B. Anderson said yesterday in a statement.
“Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful.”  Borders on July 21 won approval in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan to liquidate its remaining 399 stores. The Books-A-
Million offer to buy 21 super-stores and nine smaller ones was
made the same day.  Books-A-Million, which also runs stores under the names
Books & Co., Bookland and Joe Muggs Newsstands, is based in
Birmingham, Alabama, and operates in the southeastern U.S.  Mary Davis , a spokeswoman for Ann Arbor, Michigan-based
Borders didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment after
regular business hours yesterday.  The case is In re Borders Group Inc., 11-10614,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
