Cool weather in  Argentina ’s main
agricultural region is helping the wheat crop’s development
after farmers planted less of the grain than in the year earlier
period, a forecaster at the Rosario Cereal Exchange said.  “Cold is good for wheat because it helps the plant grow
downwards in the early stages,” and develop good roots,
Cristian Russo, a member of the Exchange’s forecast team, said
today in a telephone interview. “Average temperatures are in
line with previous years, and even a bit lower,” he said.  Wheat farmers in the central part of Argentina’s fertile
Pampas region will plant about 10 percent less hectares in 2011
than a year earlier amid government restrictions on wheat
exports, the exchange said in a  July 12 report . Farmers in other
parts of the Pampas, where weather conditions allow for fewer
alternative crops, are increasing the planted area, it said.  Temperatures fell to as low as minus 5 degrees Celsius this
month in parts of the central Pampas, near the city of Rosario.  Argentina is  Latin America ’s largest wheat producer and
farmers are forecast to plant 4.47 million hectares (11 million
acres) this season, compared with 4.5 million in 2010, according
to the Cereals Exchange. Planting goes from April through
September, while  harvesting runs  from October to January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
