Former Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  is in an “almost stable” condition though suffering
from “severe depression,” the head of the medical team
supervising him said today.  “The vital signs are almost stable,” Assem Azzam said
today in a telephone interview. “He’s in a very bad
psychological state. There’s severe depression.”  Mubarak is due to stand trial starting Aug. 3 after  Egypt ’s
public prosecutor ordered that he and his two sons, Gamal and
Alaa, be tried on charges of killing demonstrators and abusing
public office. Mubarak’s three-decade rule ended in February
when he ceded power to Egypt’s Supreme Council of the Armed
Forces after mass protests. Mubarak has denied all charges
against him, his lawyer, Farid elDib, has said.  State Egyptian television today denied a report that
Mubarak has died.  Azzam said that because of the depression, Mubarak “had no
desire to eat.” He said he cannot comment on whether the former
leader is fit to stand trial.  Mubarak is hospitalized in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-
Sheikh and his sons are being held in prison in Cairo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
