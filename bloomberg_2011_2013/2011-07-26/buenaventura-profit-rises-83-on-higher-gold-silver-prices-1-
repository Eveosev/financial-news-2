Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SA,
 Peru ’s biggest precious-metals producer, said second-quarter
profit jumped 83 percent as metals prices surged.  Net income rose to $204.2 million, or 80 cents a share,
from $111.6 million, or 44 cents, in the year-earlier period,
Buenaventura said today in an e-mailed statement. Analysts
expected profit of 90.5 cents a share on an adjusted basis, the
average of four estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Buenaventura sold gold for an average $1,508 an ounce in
the quarter, 26 percent more than a year earlier. Record gold
and silver prices offset lower output of zinc and lead, said
Imaru Casanova, chief analyst at McNicoll Lewis & Vlak.  “Help came from much stronger metals prices in the second
quarter,” Casanova, who rates the stock a “hold” and doesn’t
own shares, said by telephone before the report was released.
“Production was slack and shareholders should be concerned with
where future gold production will come from.”  Gold production rose 3 percent to 269,778 ounces, while
zinc and lead output fell 10 percent and 7 percent,
respectively, the company said. Silver output gained 11 percent
to 3.73 million ounces. New York-traded silver futures doubled
in the period.  Buenaventura’s revenue climbed 52 percent to $343.3
million, while operating costs fell 33 percent to $19.5 million.
Exploration spending rose 17 percent to $12 million.  Buenaventura’s American depositary receipts, each
representing one ordinary share, rose 38 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $42.55 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The ADRs
have gained 8.5 percent over the past year. The report was
released after the close of regular market trading in New York.  ‘Attractive’ Risk-Reward  The company has a 19 percent stake in Phoenix-based
 Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s Cerro Verde copper mine
and a 44 percent stake in  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) ’s Yanacocha gold
mine, which contributed $129.6 million toward earnings, a 50
percent increase from a year earlier.  Gold output at Yanacocha,  Latin America ’s largest gold
mine, fell 3 percent to 341,665 ounces in the quarter. Cerro
Verde copper production rose 2 percent to 76,905 metric tons.  The company and Peru’s mining industry face less risk of
radical change from President-Elect Ollanta Humala’s government
than originally expected, said Carlos De Alba, an analyst at
Morgan Stanley. Humala, who takes office July 28, won the May 5
elections on pledges to impose a mining windfall tax.  “After proposing to reappoint the current central bank
president for a new period, we believe the next administration
in Peru will pursue a moderate, more market friendly position
than the market is discounting,” De Alba, who upgraded the
stock to “overweight,” said in a July 20 report. “The stock’s
risk-reward is attractive.”  The proposed tax may make Peru’s mining industry less
competitive, Chief Executive Officer Roque Benavides said in a
July 13 interview.  Gold futures for December delivery rose $4.90, or 0.3
percent, to $1,619.30 an ounce today on the Comex in  New York .
The August contract reached a record $1,624.30 yesterday. Silver
climbed to a 31-year high of $49.845 on April 25.  (Buenaventura will hold its quarterly conference call July
