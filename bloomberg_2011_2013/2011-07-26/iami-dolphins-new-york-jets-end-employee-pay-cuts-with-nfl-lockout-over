The  Miami Dolphins  restored the full
salaries of team employees who took pay cuts of 10 to 20 percent
during the National Football League lockout.  Dolphins Chief Executive Officer Mike Dee announced the pay
cuts two months ago, blaming poor season ticket sales resulting
from the lockout. Team executives making more than $75,000 had
their salaries slashed 20 percent, while those making less had
pay cuts of as much as 15 percent, the Miami Herald said.  “Our staff was outstanding, never complained, supported
the cause,” Dee said yesterday in a news conference. “We were
all in this together and it was great news to deliver to them,
to be able to restore compensation back.”  The  New York Jets  also repaid lost wages to business
employees who took unpaid furloughs and coaches who took pay
cuts during the lockout, the  Associated Press  reported, citing
an unidentified person familiar with the situation. Jets owner
 Woody Johnson  made the announcement yesterday at a team meeting
in Florham Park, New Jersey, AP said.  At least seven NFL teams cut pay or furloughed employees
during the four-month shutdown, including the Arizona Cardinals,
Buffalo Bills, Detroit Lions, Kansas City Chiefs and Tampa Bay
Buccaneers. The lockout ended yesterday when the NFL Players
Association approved a 10-year labor agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
