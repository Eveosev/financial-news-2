Kaushik Das, an economist at
Deutsche Bank AG, comments on  India ’s monetary policy in a
research note released today.  The  Reserve Bank  of India increased the repurchase rate to
8 percent from 7.5 percent today and raised the inflation
forecast for the year ending March to 7 percent from 6 percent.  “Given the RBI’s tone, we believe that unless external
risks manifest in a disorderly manner, the RBI will find itself
compelled to raise rates again in September (by 25 basis
points).  “Further rate hikes would be unlikely as inflation
momentum could ease thereafter as food and fuel prices flatten.
We will firm up our terminal rate call in early August.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
