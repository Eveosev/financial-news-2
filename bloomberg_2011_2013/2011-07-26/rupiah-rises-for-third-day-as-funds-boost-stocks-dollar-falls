(Corrects story published July 26 to clarify rate of
economic growth in first and fifth paragraphs.)  Indonesia’s rupiah rose for a third
day as the fastest pace of economic growth since 2008 lures
overseas capital to the nation’s assets, while a failure to
reach an agreement on the U.S. debt limit drove the dollar lower.  Indonesia’s currency gained 0.8 percent this month as funds
based abroad bought $516 million more shares than they sold over
the period, according to exchange data. The  Jakarta Composite
Index (JCI)  closed at a record high. President  Barack Obama  warned the
burgeoning debt in the U.S. threatens to do “serious” damage
to the economy and urged lawmakers to seek an agreement on
raising the debt limit and avoid a default.  “The rupiah’s strength is supported by capital inflows,”
said Mika Martumpal, currency analyst at PT Bank Commonwealth in
Jakarta. “The dollar fell as investors are now focusing on what
are the compromises that both parties will agree to. Congress
has to increase the debt limit so the U.S. can meet its
obligations.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.2 percent to 8,510 per dollar as
of 4:17 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It reached 8,507 earlier, the highest since June 8. The Dollar
Index, which tracks the greenback against currencies of six
major trading partners, fell to a six-week low.  Gross domestic product increased 6.1 percent last year, the
fastest pace since 2008. GDP may rise 6.6 percent this year,
Bank  Indonesia  Deputy Governor Hartadi Sarwono told lawmakers on
July 4.  Overseas ownership  of  government bonds  rose 25 percent to
243.93 trillion rupiah ($28.6 billion) this  year  through July 22,
according to the debt management office.  The yield on the 8.25 percent notes due July 2021 fell five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.22 percent,
according to closing prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
