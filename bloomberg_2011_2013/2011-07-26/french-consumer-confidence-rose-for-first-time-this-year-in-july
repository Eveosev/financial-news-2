French  consumer confidence 
unexpectedly rose for the first time this year in July amid
signs job creation will pick up and inflation will ease.  An index of sentiment increased to 86 from 83 in June,
national statistics office Insee said today in an e-mailed
statement from Paris. Economists expected a reading of 82, the
median of eight forecasts gathered by Bloomberg News shows.  France ’s economy will expand at its fastest pace since 2007
this year, lifted by falling joblessness and slowing inflation,
Insee predicted last month. The number of unemployed in mainland
France fell by 7,000 in the first quarter and oil prices have
dropped since reaching a more than two-year high in April.  “The labor market has shown an improvement,  oil prices 
have declined from recent highs and wage growth has been
strong,” said Pierre-Olivier Beffy, Chief Economist at Exane
BNP Paribas in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
