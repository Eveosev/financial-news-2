Taiwan’s dollar strengthened as
demand for the U.S. currency waned after President  Barack Obama 
warned the economy faces dire consequences if a stalemate on
raising the debt limit isn’t resolved.  “The current debt-ceiling issue is worrying the market,
this is a U.S. dollar issue and people are reducing dollar
exposure on the back of a lack of progress,” said Perry Kojodjojo, a currency strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc in  Hong
Kong . “People will put more money in  Asia  as fundamentally the
region has much stronger growth.”  The island’s currency traded near a two-week high and the
Dollar Index dropped to the lowest level since June 7 as Obama
said a default in the U.S. would cause a “deep economic
crisis.” Republicans and Democrats are trying to iron out an
agreement on lifting the nation’s $14.3 trillion debt limit and
meet maturing obligations.  Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$28.829
against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$28.750 yesterday,
the strongest level since July 11.  The Dollar Index, which
tracks the greenback versus currencies of six major trading
partners, declined as much as 0.7 percent to 73.526.  Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on the 2
percent notes due July 2016, the most-traded of the securities,
was 1.194 percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market show.
The rate reached 1.22 percent on July 22, the highest level for
a benchmark five-year note since January 2009.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was at 0.380 percent compared with 0.379
percent yesterday, according to a weighted average compiled by
the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
