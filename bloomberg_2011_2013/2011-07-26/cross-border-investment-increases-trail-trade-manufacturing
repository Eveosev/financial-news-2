International investment, which
increased 5 percent to $1.24 trillion last year, is trailing
manufacturing and trade in recovering from the global financial
crisis and won’t approach pre-crisis levels until 2013, the
 United Nations  said.  “Global foreign direct investment has not yet bounced back
to pre-crisis levels,” UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in
the annual investment report released today by the Geneva-based
 UN Conference on Trade and Development . “The reason is not
financing constraints, but perceived risks and regulatory
uncertainty in a fragile world economy.”  Risk factors include sovereign debts crises in  Europe , the
unpredictability of global economic governance, and rising
inflation, according to the report. Of 149 investment-related
measures enacted by governments in 2010, one-third introduced
new restrictions or regulations on foreign direct investment, it
said.  Cross-border investment is forecast to reach as much as
$1.6 trillion this year, $1.7 trillion in 2012 and $1.9 trillion
in 2013, the UN agency said. The 2012 prediction was scaled back
from last year’s report, which said foreign direct investment
would likely reach $2 trillion next year.  The moderate recovery left 2010 investment 15 percent below
the pre-crisis, 2005-2007 average, and 37 percent below the
record of $1.97 trillion in 2007. FDI flows to some of the
world’s poorest regions, particularly  Africa  and South Asia,
decreased last year, and declined as well in service industries
such as utilities, transportation and communication.  Rebounding Economies  The rebound was stronger for developing economies and those
in transition, such as  Russia  and East European nations, where
investment exceeded 50 percent of the global total for the first
time. Investment by those nations, increasingly directed at the
developing world, reached a record high.  China  as a target for investment ranked second to the U.S.,
Brazil moved up to fifth place from 15th, and Russia was eighth.
 Singapore ,  Mexico , Chile and Indonesia moved into the top 20.  Investment in China increased by 11 percent, to $106
billion, the report said. Flows to Southeast Asia more than
doubled, and grew by 17 percent to East Asia.  Brazil  jumped to
$48 billion from $26 billion as investment in  South America  grew
by 56 percent.  “Increasingly, transnational corporations are engaging
with developing and transition economies through a broadening
array of production and investment models, such as contract
manufacturing and farming, service outsourcing, franchising and
licensing,” Ban said. “These relatively new phenomena present
opportunities for developing and transition economies to deepen
their integration into the rapidly evolving global economy.”  The U.S. ranked first in 2010 in both investment inflows
and outflows, at $228 billion after a 49.0 percent increase, and
$329 billion after a 16.3 percent, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
