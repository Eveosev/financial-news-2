OAO Acron, a Russian fertilizer
producer, plans to merge with its unit ZAO Granit, which holds
8.7 percent of the parent companyâ€™s shares, Acron Chairman
Alexander Popov said.  The board will soon call a shareholders meeting to approve
the transaction, Popov told investors today in the Murmansk
region. Acron would cancel 8.7 percent of its shares after
combining with Granit, he said.  Separately, Popov said Acron may issue eurobonds, without
giving any details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
