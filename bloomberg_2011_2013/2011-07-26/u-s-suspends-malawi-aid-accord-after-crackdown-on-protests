The U.S. put on hold an accord to
grant Malawi $350.7 million to improve electricity supplies
after police killed 18 people during anti-government protests.  The Millennium Challenge Corp., a government agency,
suspended the agreement that was signed on April 7, according to
an e-mailed statement from the U.S. Embassy in the capital,
Lilongwe, today.  “At the core of an MCC partnership is the expectation that
countries maintain a demonstrated commitment to political
pluralism, human rights, and the rule of law,” the organization
said. “MCC is deeply concerned by recent events in Malawi.”  Tens of thousands of people protested across Malawi on July
20 against the rising cost of living. Two days later, President
Bingu wa Mutharika told the leaders of the protest that he would
“smoke you out wherever you are.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
