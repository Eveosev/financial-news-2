Spanish and Italian 10-year
 government bonds  opened little changed, reducing the additional
yield investors demand to hold the securities instead of
benchmark German bunds.  The yield on the Spanish securities was one basis point
lower at 6.02 percent as of 7:42 a.m. in London, narrowing the
difference in yield, or spread, to benchmark German bunds by
three basis points to 323 basis points. The Italian-German  yield
spread  was two basis points tighter at 288 basis points.  Italian two-year notes fell a third day, pushing the yield
up nine basis points to 4.08 percent. The nation is scheduled to
sell six-month bills and zero-coupon bonds due in 2013 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
