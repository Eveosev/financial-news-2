Allergan Inc.’s dexamethasone
implant won the backing of the U.K.’s health-cost agency as a
treatment for the eye disorder macular edema.  The product, marketed as Ozurdex, is recommended as an
initial therapy for the ailment following central retinal vein
occlusion, which can impair vision by keeping blood from leaving
the retina. It may also be used for branch retinal vein
occlusion if laser treatment doesn’t work, the  National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence  said today in a
statement.  “Today’s guidance provides clear advice to the NHS and
patients, no matter where they live in England and  Wales , on how
this treatment can add value,” Carole Longson, director of
NICE’s Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said in the
statement. The London-based agency, known as NICE, advises the
state-run  National Health Service  on which treatments represent
the best value for money.  The cost of a 700-microgram Ozurdex implant, which lasts
six months and may be replaced as many as six times, is 870
pounds ($1,400), NICE said. The U.S.  Food and Drug
Administration  approved the drug in September,  according to the
Irvine, California-based drugmaker .  To contact the reporter on this story:
