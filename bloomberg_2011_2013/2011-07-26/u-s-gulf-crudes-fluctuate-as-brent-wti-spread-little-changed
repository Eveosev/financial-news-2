Crude oil premiums in the U.S. Gulf
fluctuated as the spread between the benchmark West Texas
Intermediate and its European counterpart, Brent, was little
changed.  The gap decreased 5 cents to $18.69 a barrel based on
today’s settlement prices. The spread settled at a record high
of $22.63 a barrel July 14. When Brent falls versus WTI, it
decreases the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with
West African oil priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium lost 50 cents to $19.50 a
barrel over WTI as of 2:09 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed
$1 a barrel to $20 a barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend decreased 50 cents to $15.45 while Poseidon lost 10 cents
to $15.15 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium advanced $2 to $13.50 a
barrel. West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed by 30 cents to 95
cents below the benchmark. Thunder Horse’s premium lost 35 cents
to $19.25.  The premium for Syncrude added $1.05 to $12.80 a barrel, a
two-month high. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil
derived from the  tar sands  in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 50 cents to
$19.50 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
