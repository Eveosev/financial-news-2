Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid 
said today that credit rating services have said his proposal
for raising the U.S. debt limit wouldn’t lead them to lower the
government’s credit rating.  “Rating agencies have said as late as last night that the
plan I have introduced will not cause a downgrading of our
credit,” he said. CNN last night cited an unidentified investor
as saying that  Standard & Poor’s  said the Reid bill would avoid
a lowering of the U.S. credit rating.  By contrast, Reid said today, the Republican plan offered
by House Speaker  John Boehner  “gives the credit agencies no
choice but to downgrade U.S. debt.”  The Treasury Department has said that unless the debt
ceiling, currently $14.3 trillion, is raised by Aug. 2, the U.S.
won’t be able to pay all its obligations.  In remarks on the Senate floor, the Nevada Democrat
defended the proposal he introduced yesterday, saying it is
“taken from the Republican playbook.”  “It’s everything Republicans have demanded, wrapped up in
a bow and delivered to their door,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
