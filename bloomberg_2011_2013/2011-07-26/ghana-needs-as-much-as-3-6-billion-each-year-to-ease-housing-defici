Ghana  needs between $2 billion and
$3.6 billion each year over the next decade to address a
shortage of housing as the population of the world’s second-
biggest cocoa producer climbs.  “We need to annually construct between 120,000 and 150,000
units of houses consistently for next 10 years to resolve the
deficit, Alban Bagbin, minister for water resources, works and
housing, told reporters in Accra, the capital, today.  Ghana ’s population climbed 28 percent to 24 million people
over the past decade, according to a census conducted last year
by the Ghana Statistical Service. Government investments in
housing haven’t kept pace with the expansion, Bagbin said. Ghana
provides housing for many of its civil servants, including
police officers and government workers.  The state raised $1.5 billion from a group of international
banks, led by  Barclays Capital , in a deal with STX Corp. of
 South Korea  to build 30,000 housing units for security officials
across Ghana, Bagbin said. The homes will be finished by 2015,
he said.  Ghana wants to encourage more public-private partnerships
to fill gaps in its housing sector by helping companies secure
land grants and providing tax exemptions on building equipment,
Bagbin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
