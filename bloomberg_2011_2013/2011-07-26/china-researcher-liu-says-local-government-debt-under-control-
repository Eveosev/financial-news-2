Liu Shangxi, a deputy director of
the Institute of Fiscal Science at  China ’s Ministry of Finance,
comments on local government debt risks in a phone interview.  “Unlike in the western world, China’s local authorities
possess a massive amount of public resources and state-owned
assets. In addition,  China’s economy  has maintained stable
growth. Based on these two reasons, we can conclude that the
risks linked to local government debt are totally under
control.”  “China’s local governments lack a complete balance sheet,
making it hard to assess risks linked to their liabilities. That
would need very complicated reforms. The local authorities’
assets are controlled by different government departments. They
all have their own books but none have a unified one.”  “China doesn’t need an asset management agency or a policy
lender to help absorb local governments’ debt. Since we don’t
have a debt crisis yet, why would we have to conduct a bailout
like that? As long as the economy grows stably, the risks will
decrease step by step.”  --Victoria Ruan. Editor:  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
