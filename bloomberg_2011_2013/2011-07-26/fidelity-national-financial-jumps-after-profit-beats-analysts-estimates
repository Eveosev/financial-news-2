Fidelity National Financial Inc. (FNF) ,
the largest U.S. title insurer, climbed the most in a year after
profit beat analysts’ estimates on a rebound in sales to
commercial real estate clients.  The insurer jumped 90 cents, or 5.7 percent, to $16.66 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Fidelity
National has advanced 22 percent this year, the biggest gain in
the 24-compamy KBW Insurance Index.  Second-quarter earnings per share of 36 cents beat by 5
cents the average estimate of four analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Net income was $80 million, compared with $139.6
million a year earlier when the insurer recorded an after-tax
gain of $63 million tied to the sale of a claims-management
unit, the Jacksonville, Florida-based company said late
yesterday in a statement.  “The strength of our commercial business” aided results
amid a slump in the residential market, Chairman William P. Foley said in the statement.  Title insurers use their records and public documents to
verify a seller is the property’s true owner and that the real
estate is free from liens. Revenue from the commercial segment
climbed 38 percent to $93.8 million from $68.1 million a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
