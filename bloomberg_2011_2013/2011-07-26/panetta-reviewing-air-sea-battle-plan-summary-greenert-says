U.S. Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta 
is reviewing an Air Force-Navy battle concept that was ordered
by the Pentagon last year in response to  China ’s military
buildup and Iran’s advanced weapons, Vice Chief of Naval
Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert said today.  The Navy and Air Force have submitted to Panetta the
equivalent of an executive summary of the battle concept with
the intent to release unclassified portions within weeks,
depending on Panetta’s reaction, Greener told a House Armed
Services readiness panel and a Bloomberg News reporter after the
hearing.  The plan aims to combine the strengths of the Navy and Air
Force to enable long-range strikes. It may employ a new
generation of bombers, a new cruise missile and drones launched
from aircraft carriers. The Navy also is increasing funding to
develop new unmanned submarines.  The concept was directed in the Pentagon’s 2010 Quadrennial
Defense Review to ensure the  Air Force  and Navy gain more
effective ways of protecting U.S. access to the western Pacific
while countering potential threats to American bases and
personnel.  The battle plan is among a range of initiatives outlined in
the review, which is conducted every four years to revise U.S.
military strategy for the coming decade or more. The report
placed top priority on the fights in  Afghanistan  and  Iraq  and
against terrorist threats elsewhere, while also preparing for
future threats.  To contact the reporters on this story: Tony Carpaccio in
