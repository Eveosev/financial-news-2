Palm oil  recovered from the biggest
decline in two weeks on concern that deteriorating soybean crop
conditions in the U.S. may boost the demand for the tropical
commodity used in food and biofuels.  The October-delivery contract climbed as much as 0.8
percent to 3,124 ringgit ($1,057) per metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, and was trading at 3,118 ringgit at 4:51
p.m. in Kuala Lumpur. The most-active contract fell 1.3 percent
yesterday, the biggest drop at the close since July 12.  The gain in palm oil “is most likely due to the soybean
market, where supplies are being threatened by poor weather,”
Arhnue Tan, an associate director at ECM Libra Capital Sdn.,
said by phone from  Kuala Lumpur . Palm oil and soybean oil are
substitutes in food and fuel uses.  An estimated 62 percent of the soybean crop in the U.S.,
the world’s biggest exporter, was in good or excellent condition
as of July 24, compared with 64 percent a week earlier and 67
percent a year earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
yesterday.  “A marginal rise in exports, and expectations of a mild
drop in production over the next two months underpinned
sentiment,” Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, a director at Mumbai-based
Commtrendz Risk Management Services Pvt., said in a report
today.  Output in Malaysia and Indonesia usually declines in the
Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which starts in August this
year, as plantation workers head home, he said.  Malaysian exports gained 2.3 percent to 1.28 million tons
in the first 25 days of July from the same period in June,
surveyor Intertek said yesterday. Shipments rose 1.9 percent to
1.29 million tons, Societe Generale de Surveillance said.  Soybeans for delivery in November advanced as much as 0.8
percent to $13.83 per bushel in  Chicago .  Soybean oil  for
December delivery was up 0.5 percent at 57.26 cents per pound.  Palm oil for May delivery climbed 0.8 percent to 9,172 yuan
($1,424) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange . Soybean oil for
delivery in the same month increased 0.7 percent to 10,268 yuan
a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
