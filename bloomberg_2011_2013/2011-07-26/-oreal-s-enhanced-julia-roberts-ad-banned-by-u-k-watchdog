The U.K.’s Advertising Standards
Authority banned advertisements by  L’Oreal SA (OR) ’s Maybelline New
York and Lancome cosmetics brands for being misleading after
complaints by a member of parliament.  The print advertisements, which feature digitally enhanced
images of actress  Julia Roberts  and supermodel Christy Turlington, didn’t accurately represent what Maybelline’s The
Eraser and Lancome’s Teint Miracle foundations could achieve
based on information supplied by the brands, the watchdog said
today in separate statements on its website. Neither ad can
appear again in its current form, the regulator said.  “Excessive airbrushing and digital manipulation techniques
have become the norm,” Jo Swinson, a Liberal Democratic MP who
complained to the authority about the advertisements, said today
in a statement. “This ban sends a powerful message to
advertisers: Let’s get back to reality.”  Swinson is co-founder of the Campaign for Body Confidence,
a lobbying group focused on mass media’s depictions of women.  “We do not believe that the ad exaggerates the effect that
can be achieved using this product,” Liz Clark, a spokeswoman
for Lancome, said in an e-mail. Her comments were echoed by a
Maybelline spokeswoman in a separate e-mail who asked not to be
named citing company policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
