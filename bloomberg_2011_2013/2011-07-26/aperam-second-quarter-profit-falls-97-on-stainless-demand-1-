Aperam, the stainless-steel producer
spun off by  ArcelorMittal (MT) , said second-quarter profit slumped 97
percent as steel sales declined, and forecast earnings will
“trough” in the third quarter.  Net income dropped to $2 million in the period from $66
million a year earlier, the Luxembourg-based company said today
in a statement. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization were $102 million, missing the $111.3 million
average estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Stainless-steel customers adopted “wait-and-see behavior,
which had a negative impact on pricing,” Aperam said. While a
seasonal slowdown will see Ebitda “trough” in the third
quarter, Aperam said it has “started to see signs of market
stabilization, which gives us confidence for the end of the
year.”  European stainless-steel producers face overcapacity and
higher raw-material costs at the same time as prices of the
finished metal decline. European stainless steel averaged 1,155
euros a ton in the quarter, 7.6 percent lower than a year
earlier. Outokumpu Oyj, a Finnish producer of the alloy, last
week forecast a decline in third-quarter profit as demand and
prices slump.  Aperam’s second-quarter sales rose 13 percent to $1.71
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
