Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the builder
of the world’s tallest tower in Dubai, said second-quarter
profit dropped 69 percent as it wrote down the value of a bank
investment and delivered fewer completed homes.  Net income fell to 250 million dirhams ($68 million), or 4
fils a share, from 802 million dirhams, or 13 fils, a year
earlier, the Dubai-based developer said in a statement today.
The median estimate of seven analysts in a Bloomberg survey was
for a profit of 233 million dirhams.  Emaar is collecting final payments from buyers of homes in
Burj Khalifa tower who bought during the years before the
financial crisis caused Dubai’s property market to slump.  Home
prices  in Dubai have fallen by more than 60 percent since the
peak in mid-2008 when demand shrank after banks curtailed
lending.  Emaar handed over 244 housing units to buyers in the
period, down from 612 a year earlier.  Quarterly revenue fell 23 percent to 2.03 billion dirhams,
the company said. Emaar booked a writedown of 172 million
dirhams for its stake in Dubai Bank, compared with a year-
earlier writedown of 41 million dirhams.  “Emaar’s current focus is on identifying and strengthening
our operations by taking into account the current social,
economic and political changes across all our key markets,”
Chairman Mohammed Alabbar said in the statement.  Emaar was little changed in Dubai trading at 2.88 dirhams
at the 2 p.m. close in Dubai. The shares have dropped 19 percent
so far this year, giving the company a market value of 17.5
billion dirhams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
