The  New York Giants  signed Mark Herzlich, a former  Boston College  linebacker and bone-cancer
survivor, as a free agent after he went undrafted in April,
according to his Twitter account.  Herzlich, 23, announced the signing this morning, saying he
was excited to join the National Football League team. Giants
spokesman Pat Hanlon said in an e-mail that he couldn’t
officially confirm Herzlich’s posting.  The 2008  Atlantic Coast Conference  Defensive Player of the
Year, Herzlich was diagnosed in 2009 with Ewing’s sarcoma, a
rare bone cancer. Told by doctors that he might never play
football again, Herzlich sat out in 2009 while undergoing
chemotherapy and radiation treatment, and returned to play his
senior season last year, recording 65 tackles with four
interceptions.  “I’m going to be a force on the field wherever I am
placed,” Herzlich said today in a televised interview on ESPN.
“Whenever I get on the field it’s going to be intensity, it’s
going to be aggression.”  The NFL’s free-agency period began today, one day after
owners and players agreed on a 10-year labor agreement, ending a
four-month shutdown. Starting this morning teams can begin
signing drafted and undrafted rookies, and negotiate with free
agents.  Herzlich joins other former  Boston College  Eagles in  New
York , including coach  Tom Coughlin , guard Chris Snee and
defensive end Mathias Kiwanuka, now a free agent. Herzlich wore
Kiwanuka’s No. 94 at Boston College after Kiwanuka joined the
Giants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
