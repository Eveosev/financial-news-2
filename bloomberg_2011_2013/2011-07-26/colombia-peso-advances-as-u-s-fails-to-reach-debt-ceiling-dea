Colombia ’s peso gained against the
dollar as U.S. lawmakers and President  Barack Obama  remained
unable to reach an agreement to raise the nation’s debt ceiling
and avert a default.  The peso advanced 0.3 percent to 1,759.3 per dollar at 2:20
p.m. New York time, from 1,764 yesterday. The currency has
jumped 8.9 percent since March 1, the best performance among 25
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “The dollar is falling in international markets amid
concerns over whether measures in the U.S. to confront the debt
before Aug. 2 are viable,” said Po Jeng, an analyst at
Interbolsa SA.  Republicans and Democrats in Congress are trying to round
up votes for rival debt plans aimed at averting a U.S. default
one week from today.  A day after Obama and House Speaker  John Boehner  made back-
to-back televised speeches on dueling visions to cut the deficit
and raise the nation’s $14.3 trillion debt ceiling, Senate and
House leaders are pushing proposals that diverge over whether to
force another showdown early next year.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 fell
11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 7.7 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price rose 1.004
centavo to 118.467 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
