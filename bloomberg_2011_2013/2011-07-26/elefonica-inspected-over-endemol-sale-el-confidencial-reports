Spanish tax authorities are
reviewing the way  Telefonica SA (TEF)  accounted for the sale of
Endemol NV in 2007,  El Confidencial  reported, without citing
anyone.  A spokesman for the telephone company declined to comment
on the report. No one was available for comment at the tax
agency in  Madrid .  Telefonica, which sold Endemol for 2.6 billion euros ($3.8
billion), said it made 1.4 billion euros in  capital gains  from
the sale after having bought the company for 5.5 billion euros
in 2000, El Confidencial said.  Telefonica considered it made a capital gain from the sale
because it bought Endemol with shares and sold it for cash, El
Confidencial added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
