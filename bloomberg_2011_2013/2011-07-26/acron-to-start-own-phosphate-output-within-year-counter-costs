OAO Acron, a Russian nitrogen
fertilizer producer, plans to produce its own phosphates within
a year as it seeks to boost self-sufficiency in raw materials.  Acron will start its Oleniy Ruchey mine in the Murmansk
region by the end of June 2012, Chairman Alexander Popov told
investors today in Murmansk. The project will meet the companyâ€™s
demand for apatite concentrate, which it currently buys from OAO
PhosAgro at about $140 a metric ton including delivery, he said.  Fertilizer producers are looking to add more of their own
raw materials as rising corn, soybean and wheat prices help to
drive up the cost of the phosphates used in crop nutrients.  Investment in the Oleniy Ruchey project will total as much
as $1 billion, Acron said today in a presentation to investors.
It has already spent $250 million on the development since 2006
and plans to invest about $200 million this year, it said.  The Velikiy Novgorod-based company will build a processing
plant at the site with initial capacity of 1 million metric tons
of apatite concentrate a year, rising to 2 million tons in 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
