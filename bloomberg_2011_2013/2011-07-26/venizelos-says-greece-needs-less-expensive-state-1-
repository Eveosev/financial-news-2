Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said his country needs a “less expensive state” and
its privatization program is “very ambitious.”  Venizelos, during a speech in Washington today, also said
 Greece  needs “national unity.” He met earlier with U.S.
Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  and said in a statement
after the meeting that the two had “very positive” talks.  European Union leaders on July 21 reached an agreement on a
second rescue package for Greece worth 159 billion euros ($229
billion). They also strengthened the region’s bailout mechanism
to offer protection to other euro-region nations in a bid to
stamp out contagion from the debt crisis.  Petros Christodoulou, head of the Athens-based Public Debt
Management Agency, appearing with Venizelos, said Greece hasn’t
requested additional financial help from the  International
Monetary Fund .  Venizelos told reporters afterward that Greece had been in
contact with the IMF on “procedural issues.”  “The important point is the positive and constructive
position of the staff, and first of all, of Madame Lagarde,”
Venizelos said, referring to  Christine Lagarde , the managing
director of the IMF.  To contact the reporters on this story:
