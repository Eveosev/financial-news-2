Gold futures rose for the third
straight session as the prolonged U.S. debt stalemate boosts
demand for the precious metal as a haven.  The dollar fell against a basket of six major currencies
and U.S. equities declined as lawmakers offered competing plans
on raising the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling. Gold has jumped 7.8
percent this month amid fiscal woes in the U.S. and  Europe .  “The flight-to-quality money is reasserting itself into
gold,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior strategist at Lind-Waldock,
a broker in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “The budget
problems are persistent, and people want to own gold during this
calamity.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose $4.90, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $1,619.30 an ounce at 1:48 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Earlier, the price fluctuated between gains
and losses. The August contract reached a record $1,624.30
yesterday.  President  Barack Obama . in a speech last night, warned of a
“deep economic crisis” without a compromise to avert a
default.  “When the issues get resolved, the gold price could
tumble, so short term, I’m bearish,” Tom Winmill, who manages
the Midas Fund in  New York , said on Bloomberg Television’s
“Street Smart” before Obama’s address. “It could go down
$100. That’s the fear premium that’s built up.”  Silver futures for September delivery rose 33.7 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $40.698 an ounce on the Comex.  Platinum futures for October delivery gained $13.20, or 0.7
percent, to $1,807.20 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Palladium futures for September delivery gained
$27.20, or 3.4 percent, to $836.10 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
