Chilean stocks fell, sending the
benchmark index to its biggest decline in five months, on
concern about a deadlock in negotiations to raise the U.S. debt
ceiling and speculation that local retailers may face new
restrictions on making consumer loans.  The IPSA index fell 2.1 percent to 4,525.30 at 4:22 p.m.
New York time, the steepest drop since Feb. 9.  “The discussions to raise the debt ceiling are having an
effect here, and there’s the threat of restrictions on the
interest rates that retailers will be allowed to charge,” Pablo Andalaft, deputy manager of investment strategy at Santiago-
based brokerage Negocios & Valores SA, said in a phone interview
today.  Chile’s government is considering changes to interest-rate
limits as a way to bolster consumer protection after a credit
scandal at retailer  Empresas La Polar SA (LAPOLAR) , Economy Minister Pablo Longueira said July 22. Representatives from local retailers and
the government will hold discussions this week to announce
measures within the next 60 days, Longueira said July 25,
according to the  Economy Ministry ’s website.  Empresas Hites SA (HITES) , a department store operator, fell 6
percent to 474.31 pesos, while  SACI Falabella (FALAB) , the country’s
largest retailer by market value, retreated 3.9 percent to
4,545.7 pesos, the steepest fall in six weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
