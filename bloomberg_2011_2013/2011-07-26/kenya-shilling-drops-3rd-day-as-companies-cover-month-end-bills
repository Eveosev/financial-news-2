Kenya ’s shilling weakened for a
third day as companies bought dollars to cover month-end
payments to overseas suppliers.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy lost 0.4
percent to 90.65 per dollar at 12:41 p.m. in Nairobi, Kenya’s
capital, from yesterday’s close of 90.33.  “The shilling has weakened on residual demand by
businesses as they prepare to settle their end-month bills,”
Bernard Matimu, chief dealer at Nairobi-based NIC Bank Ltd.,
said in a phone interview today.  Kenyan companies require dollars for payment of imported
machinery, spare parts and raw materials for the oil and
telecommunications industries along with manufacturing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
