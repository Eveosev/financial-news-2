Alan Greenspan , the former chairman
of the Federal Reserve, warned governments against seeking to
protect their populations from all economic risk, saying such
efforts use up capital that would be better employed elsewhere.  “Since the devastating Japanese earthquake and, earlier,
the financial tsunami, governments have been pressed to
guarantee their populations against virtually all risks,”
Greenspan wrote in a piece for the Financial Times published
today. “But should they? Guarantees require the building-up of
a buffer of idle resources that are not otherwise engaged in the
production of goods and services.”  Group of 20 governments and banking regulators have sought
to limit the chances of a future financial crisis, in part by
forcing banks to hold more capital against possible future
losses. That push could end up diverting funds away from more
productive uses, Greenspan said.  “Any excess bank equity capital would also constitute a
buffer that is not otherwise available to finance productivity-
enhancing investment,” he wrote. “If policymakers choose to
buffer their populations against every conceivable risk, their
standards of living would almost certainly decline.”  Greenspan was chairman of the  Federal Reserve  between 1987
and 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
