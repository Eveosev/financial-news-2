U.S. Representative David Wu, an
Oregon Democrat, announced today that he will resign from the
House. The Oregonian newspaper in  Portland  had  reported  on
allegations that Wu engaged in unwanted sexual activity with an
18-year-old girl.  “The time has come to hand on the privilege of high
office,” Wu said in a statement. “I cannot care for my family
the way I wish while serving in Congress and fighting these very
serious allegations.”  Wu, a seven-term House member from Portland, said he will
resign when the debt-ceiling debate is resolved.  House Democratic leader  Nancy Pelosi  on July 25 asked the
ethics committee to investigate allegations that Wu “may have
engaged in inappropriate activities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
