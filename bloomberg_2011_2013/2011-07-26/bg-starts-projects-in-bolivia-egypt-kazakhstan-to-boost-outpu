BG Group Plc (BG/)  started projects in
 Bolivia , Egypt and  Kazakhstan  and said they will contribute to a
“strong ramp up” in production next year.  BG together with partners agreed in July to expand the
Margarita project in Bolivia. The company plans to invest about
$414 million to pump more than 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent
net to the company by 2014, it said today in a statement.  In Kazakhstan, it started a new unit at the Karachaganak
field in June, which would enable BG and partners to export
about 10.3 million tons of gas condensate a year. In Egypt, BG
and partners agreed in May to invest in the West Delta Deep
Marine Phase 8b development to expand production offshore the
 Nile Delta , the U.K. company said.  BG “continues to expect modest production growth in 2011,
ahead of the strong ramp-up in production volumes which begins
in 2012 and continues through the decade,” said the Reading-
England based company.  The company has invested $4.4 billion in organic growth in
the first half of the year, Chief Executive Officer  Frank
Chapman  said in the statement. Oil and gas production in the
second quarter increased 3 percent to 58.9 million barrels of
oil equivalent (647,000 barrels a day) from the same period last
year.  Expenditure for the full year was in line with the
company’s previous guidance of $10 billion, BG said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
