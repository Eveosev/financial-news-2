Five military officers and two
civilians have been arrested in  Niger  for planning to overthrow
the government of President Mahamadou Issoufou, who has been in
power since March, a police official said.  The coup was to take place on July 19 or July 20, during
the celebration of Issoufou’s first 100 days in office,
according to the official, who declined to be identified because
he is not authorized to speak to the press.  Issoufou’s election returned the West African nation to
civilian rule after a February 2010 coup that ousted Mamadou Tandja. Justice Minister Marou Amadou didn’t answer calls made
to his mobile phone today.  Agence France-Presse  reported the arrests earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
