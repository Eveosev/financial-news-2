Speeches by politicians are usually
full of spin, biased use of facts and appeals to emotion.
President  Barack Obama ’s address to the nation last night on the
debt ceiling was no exception.  House Speaker  John Boehner ’s response was in a different
league. It was chock full of statements that simply aren’t true.  Let’s go to the videotape.  Boehner: “Here’s what we got for that spending binge: a
massive health-care bill that most Americans never asked for. A
'stimulus' bill that was more effective in producing material
for late-night comedians than it was in producing jobs. And a
national debt that has gotten so out of hand it has sparked a
crisis without precedent in my lifetime or yours.”  Facts are stubborn things. Whatever one thinks of it, the
Obama health-care law wasn’t part of the “spending binge.” The
law has yet to significantly contribute to the  budget deficit 
because most of it hasn’t been phased in yet.  According to  the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office ,
the stimulus bill created millions of new jobs, which as a
factual matter is at least as “effective” as a David Letterman
monologue. And anyone with the most rudimentary knowledge of the
2008-09 economic meltdown knows that it was “sparked” by a
crisis in private debt, not “the national debt.” The latter
wasn’t a big problem when, say, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
went bust.  Boehner: “The president would not take yes for an answer.”  Saying “Yes”  This line was brazenly lifted from Obama’s July 22 press
conference. No harm in that; stealing catchphrases is common in
politics. The problem with the line is that it isn’t true. Not a
single time during the process did the Republicans ever publicly
answer “yes” to something that the president offered. In fact,
they walked out of talks twice.  Boehner: “The president has often said we need a balanced
approach -- which in  Washington  means: We spend more, you pay
more.”  In truth, Obama’s “balanced approach” has a specific
meaning that is factually at odds with what Boehner claimed. It
means the government spends less -- almost $3 trillion less over
10 years -- not “more.”  And it only means “you pay more” if by “you” Boehner meant
Americans who make more than $250,000 a year, a tiny proportion
of his TV audience.  Boehner: “The president is adamant that we cannot make
fundamental changes to our entitlement programs.”  Entitlement Cuts  To the consternation of his liberal base, Obama has
endorsed raising the age of Medicare eligibility, means-testing
benefits and reducing the growth of future Social Security
payments -- a total of $650 billion in entitlement cuts. To
suggest, as Boehner did, that Obama was subscribing to the old
Democratic line that entitlements can’t be changed is untrue.  Boehner: “You see, there is no stalemate in Congress.”  We do see, and our eyes tell us the plain truth: There is
in fact a stalemate in Congress.  Boehner: “If the president signs it,” meaning the House
bill, “the crisis atmosphere he created will simply disappear.”  Boehner is right that if Obama fully capitulated and signed
the House bill, the crisis would end. But it’s simply untrue to
suggest that the president “created” the “crisis atmosphere.”
Saying so is Orwellian.  Conservatives can legitimately argue that they were right
to turn the debt ceiling into a crisis to achieve their ends.
But it’s unfair to blame someone else for creating something you
created yourself -- and, make no mistake, the  Republican Party 
has turned what should be a standard procedural increase to the
debt ceiling into a potential calamity.  Boehner: “I’ve always believed, the bigger the government,
the smaller the people.”  This one is an opinion, so it’s not falsifiable. But it’s
certainly at odds with American history. Big government can be
harmful. But is that “always” so? Did World War II, the space
program and the big spending of  Ronald Reagan ’s presidency, to
take only a few examples, make us all “smaller”?  Speak for yourself, Mr. Speaker.  (Jonathan Alter, the author of “The Defining Moment: FDR’s
