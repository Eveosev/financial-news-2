OAO Polyus Gold, the largest Russian
producer of the metal, said first-half output rose 21 percent,
led by a doubling of production at its Blagodatnoye mine.  Production climbed to 611,000 ounces in the period from
503,000 ounces a year earlier, Moscow-based Polyus said today in
a statement. Gold sales increased 50 percent to $909 million.  Gold companies are boosting output as prices for the metal
soar. Gold rose to a record $1,624.07 yesterday as U.S.
lawmakers remained deadlocked on how to tackle the country’s
debt crisis and avert a default before an Aug. 2 deadline.  Polyus boosted output at its Blagodatnoye, Olimpiada,
Titimukhta and Rossypi mines, while its KazakhGold Group unit
posted a 24 percent rise in production.  Billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov , a shareholder and former
chief executive officer of Polyus, said in December that he
planned to make Polyus one of the world’s three biggest gold
miners. Barrick Gold Corp., Newmont Mining Corp. and AngloGold
Ashanti Ltd. are the largest producers of the metal by output,
according to 2009 data from London-based researcher GFMS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
