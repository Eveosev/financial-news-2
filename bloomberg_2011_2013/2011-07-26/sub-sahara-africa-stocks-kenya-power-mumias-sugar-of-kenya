electricity distributor, fell 25 cents, or 1.2 percent, to 20
shillings, the lowest since July 19, after saying it will begin
scheduled outages from tomorrow amid a shortage caused by a lack
of infrastructure and machine breakdowns.  Mumias Sugar Co. (MSUG KN), Kenya’s biggest producer of the

on speculation it will lose revenue after the company failed to

yesterday it would begin scheduled power cuts tomorrow due to
power-supply shortages caused by the “unavailability’” of 26
megawatts from Mumias Sugar’s co-generation plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
