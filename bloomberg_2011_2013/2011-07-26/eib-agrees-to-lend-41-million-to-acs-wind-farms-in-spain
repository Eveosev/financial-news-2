The  European Investment Bank  agreed
a 28.3 million-euro ($41 million) loan for a wind park developed
by a unit of  Spain ’s Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA
and Grupo Empresarial Inverduero.  La Boga II park in northwest Spain comprises three wind
farms totaling 113 megawatts in the Castilla y Leon region,
according to a  statement  on the bank’s website.  A spokeswoman for the Luxembourg-based bank declined to
give further financial information when reached by e-mail,
except that the loan was “intermediated” by Instituto de
Credito Oficial, an institution owned by the Spanish government.
The bank, the European Union’s lending arm, first listed the
project in July 2008, according to the statement.  Madrid-based ACS didn’t respond to messages by e-mail and
phone seeking more information. The company is developing the
facility through its Energias y Recursos Ambientales SA unit.  ACS said in a regulatory filing on July 1 that it will make
a profit of as much as 160 million euros from the sale of stakes
in five wind parks and and two thermosolar plants. Cinco Dias
reported on July 18 that Gas Natural SDG SA is in talks with ACS
to buy 15 Spanish wind parks for 600 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
