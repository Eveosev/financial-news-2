Deepali Bhargava, an economist at
the Indian unit of ING Groep NV, comments on  India ’s interest
rates. The  Reserve Bank  of India today raised the repurchase
rate by half percentage point to 8 percent. None of 22
economists in a Bloomberg News survey had predicted the move.  Bhargava spoke in a phone interview from Mumbai.  “The central bank has indicated it wants to take inflation
head-on as demand conditions are strong.  ‘‘For the central bank to be comfortable they have to see
how inflationary expectations can be brought down. It is also
uncertain how moderation in global commodity prices is going to
pan out.  ‘‘So, a combination of wage prices and global commodity
prices is not able to give the central bank enough comfort that
monetary policy transmission is happening.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
