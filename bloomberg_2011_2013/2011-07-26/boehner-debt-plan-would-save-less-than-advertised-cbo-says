House Speaker  John Boehner ’s budget-
cutting proposal set for a vote in that chamber tomorrow would
save less than Republicans anticipated, with the savings
projected to total $850 billion over the next 10 years,
according to the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office .  Boehner’s two-step plan is intended to make $1.2 trillion
in spending cuts in a first phase and up to $1.8 trillion in a
second step, with those cuts to be proposed by a special
congressional committee.  CBO said the first phase would save about $850 billion.  The nonpartisan agency refused to give Republicans credit
for the second-phase $1.8 trillion because CBO couldn’t predict
whether the committee would be able to agree on a budget-cutting
plan.  The proposal’s savings would total about $1.1 trillion, CBO
said, if savings previously enacted by Congress are included.  To contact the reporter on this story:
