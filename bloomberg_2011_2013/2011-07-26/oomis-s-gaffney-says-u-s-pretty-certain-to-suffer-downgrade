The U.S. government’s credit rating
will probably be lowered because politicians are unlikely to
agree on a plan to cut spending, according to Kathleen Gaffney,
co-manager of the $21 billion Loomis Sayles Bond Fund.  Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch
Ratings put the U.S.’s AAA rating under review this month as
talks to raise the government’s $14.3 trillion debt limit
stalled.  Gaffney spoke with  Carol Massar  and  Matt Miller  on
Bloomberg Television’s “Street Smart” today.  On the likelihood of spending cuts averting a downgrade:  “I would like to see a plan. I don’t think we see a
plan.”  “I’m pretty certain that at least by one agency we’re
going to see a downgrade.”  On the effects of a downgrade:  “The real effect of the downgrade is not likely to be
huge.”  “It’s a big deal in terms of the fact that the folks down
in  Washington  can’t get their act together and can’t settle on a
path to fiscal discipline.”  On the Treasury market:  “It will continue to be a large, liquid market whether
it’s AAA or AA.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
