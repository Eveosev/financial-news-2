European Union imports of soymeal,
used in  animal feed , will rise to the second-highest level ever
as users shun high-priced grains and supplies of competitor
rapemeal decline, Hamburg-based researcher Oil World said.  Imports of soymeal by the 27-nation bloc will rise 10
percent to 24.4 million metric tons in the marketing year that
ends on Sept. 30, the researcher said today in a report. Imports
were higher only in the 2007-2008 marketing year, according to
Oil World. EU importers bought about 300,000 tons from  India 
this year, according to the report.  “Reduced supplies of rapemeal plus higher demand for
oilmeals at the expense of grains have contributed to a
significant recovery in EU soya meal imports and consumption in
the current season,” Oil World said.  Soymeal futures on the  Chicago  Board of Trade rose 0.7
percent today to $365.90 a short ton as of 11:30 a.m. London
time. The price has gained 32 percent in the past year. Soybean
futures in Chicago are up 43 percent in the past year.  Argentina ’s soymeal exports to the EU will rise 13 percent
to 13.3 million tons and Brazilian shipments will jump 17
percent to 10.3 million tons, Oil World said. India will ship
300,000 tons, up from 39,000 tons last year, the researcher
said. U.S. exports will fall 43 percent to 610,000 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
