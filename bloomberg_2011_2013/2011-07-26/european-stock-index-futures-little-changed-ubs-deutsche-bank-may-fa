European stocks retreated for a
second day as companies from  BP Plc (BP/)  to UBS AG reported earnings
that missed analysts’ estimates and concern grew that U.S.
lawmakers may fail to increase the nation’s debt limit.  BP,  Europe ’s second-biggest oil company, and UBS,
Switzerland’s largest bank, slid more than 2.5 percent.
 STMicroelectronics NV (STM) , Europe’s biggest semiconductor maker,
sank the most in almost 10 years after saying there will be a
“correction” in sales.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 0.4 percent to
270.08 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge has retreated
7.2 percent from this year’s high in February amid concern that
Europe’s fiscal crisis will derail the economic recovery and
speculation that U.S. lawmakers will fail to agree on increasing
the nation’s debt ceiling by next week’s deadline.  “It will be a very mixed earnings season and the second
half of the year is a bit more cloudy than some people
expected,” said Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein, an equity strategist
at Deutsche Postbank AG in Bonn. “It’s a difficult situation
for European banks at the moment because of the risk aversion of
market participants.”  President  Barack Obama  warned yesterday of a “deep
economic crisis” without a compromise to avert a U.S. default
as he dueled Republican House Speaker  John Boehner  in back-to
back speeches on increasing the debt limit.  Government’s Bills  The U.S. Treasury Department may still have enough cash to
pay the government’s bills for days or even weeks if Congress
fails to increase the debt limit before the Aug. 2 deadline, say
analysts at  UBS AG (UBSN)  and Barclays Plc. Both  Standard & Poor’s  and
Moody’s Investors Service are weighing a reduction of the U.S.
credit rating.  “If we get the downgrade from S&P, which seems inevitable
at this point, that could very well have negative long term
implications for equities,” Barry Knapp, an equity strategist
at Barclays in  New York , said in a Bloomberg television
interview.  National benchmark indexes dropped in 11 of the 18 western
European markets.  France ’s CAC 40 declined 0.7 percent and
 Germany ’s DAX Index was little changed. The U.K.’s FTSE 100
advanced 0.1 percent as a report showed the country’s economy
grew 0.2 percent in the second quarter, matching the median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  BP, UBS Drop  BP slid 2.6 percent to 463.25 pence after the company
reported profit adjusted for one-time items and changes in
inventory that missed analyst estimates.  UBS lost 2.9 percent to 13.50 Swiss francs after saying
second-quarter net income fell to 1.02 billion francs ($1.27
billion) from 2.01 billion francs in the year-earlier period.
That missed the 1.29 billion-franc mean estimate of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  STMicroelectronics plunged 12 percent to 5.69 euros in
Milan, the biggest drop since 2001, as Chief Executive Officer
 Carlo Bozotti  said there will be a “correction” in sales and
gross margin in the third quarter because of difficulties at
customer Nokia Oyj.  Kesko Oyj (KESBV) , Finland’s biggest retailer, fell 7.3 percent to
28.34 euros, its lowest price in a year, after reporting second-
quarter net income of 54 million euros, missing analysts’
estimates of 59 million euros.  Groupe  SEB SA (SK)  sank 6.3 percent to 68.23 euros, the biggest
decline in almost two years. The world’s largest maker of
countertop kitchen appliances said first-half profit was 93
million euros compared with 89 million euros a year earlier.  Below Expectations  The results were “well below expectations,” Denis Moreau
and Julie de Vigneral, analysts at UBS AG, wrote in a report.
“SEB is exposed to raw materials prices volatility that may
affect profitability.”  Norsk Hydro ASA (NHY) , Europe’s third-largest aluminum producer,
climbed 2.2 percent to 39.76 kroner as the company reported
second-quarter net income of 1.41 billion kroner ($263 million),
beating the 1.07 billion-krone average of 11 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  BG Group Plc (BG/)  rallied 4.3 percent to 1,486.5 pence, the
highest since May. The U.K.’s third-biggest oil company said
second-quarter profit doubled to $1.24 billion as prices for oil
and gas and production rose.  Societe Television Francaise 1 (TFI)  surged 7.5 percent to 13.68
euros, the largest increase in 14 months, after the owner of
France’s most-watched TV channel said first-half net income rose
60 percent to 118.6 million euros ($172 million).  Royal KPN NV advanced 3.2 percent to 10.15 euros as the
biggest Dutch phone company reiterated its forecast that
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
will be more than 5.3 billion euros in 2011.  SAP AG (SAP)  rallied 3.6 percent to 43.49 euros as the world’s
largest maker of business-management software boosted its full-
year outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
