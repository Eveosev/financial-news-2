Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s
second worst-performing currency over the past month, advanced
against the dollar on reduced demand for the U.S. currency and
as inflows of the greenback into the East African nation rose.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest coffee producer
gained less than 0.1 percent  to 2,599 per dollar at 3.45 p.m.
in the capital, Kampala, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “We have seen some dollar inflows today for the non-
government sector, which normally come in at this period of the
month,” Benon Okwenje, a currency trader at Stanbic Bank of
Uganda Ltd., said by phone from Kampala.  The shilling may appreciate to 2,590 per dollar during the
week, which in turn may trigger increased demand and result in
the currency declining to 2,610 a dollar by July 29, the lowest
on a closing basis since July 7, he said.  The shilling has depreciated 11 percent against the dollar
this year, the world’s third-worst performing currency after
Suriname’s dollar and Maldives’ rufiyaa, as a surge in food and
fuel prices pushed inflation to a 17-year high. The currency has
weakened 3.8 percent over the past month,the most worldwide
after  Turkey ’s lira, which has slumped 4.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
