Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan
plans to send a bill to parliament seeking a single term for
elected office holders, his spokesman, Reuben Abati, said today
in a telephone interview in Abuja, the capital.  “What the president wants to do is to end all the acrimony
associated with re-elections,” Abati said. Jonathan “will not
benefit from it.”  Details, including the number of years for the single term,
will be provided in the bill, the spokesman said, denying some
media reports that Jonathan is seeking to extend his tenure in
office.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
