European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Christian Noyer  said policy makers remain in a
mode of “strong vigilance” after this month’s interest-rate
increase, Financial Times Deutschland reported, citing an
interview.  The comment was confirmed by a a spokeswoman from the 
French central bank, which Noyer heads.   “The ECB never pre-commits with its monetary policy,”
Noyer told the newspaper. “We wanted to give a clear signal 
that inflationary pressure as a consequence of higher oil and 
commodity prices doesn’t establish itself as permanent price 
increase via second-round effects.”  While energy prices stabilized since then and economic
growth slowed in the second quarter, prices of some commodities
are increasing, capacity utilization is rising and tax increases
in some countries might result in higher prices, Noyer told the
FTD.  “Therefore, the ECB council remains in a position of very
strong vigilance, without being predetermined about what we will
do,” Noyer was quoted as saying by FTD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
