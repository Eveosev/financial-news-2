The ruble advanced to its strongest
versus the dollar in more than two months as oil,  Russia ’s chief
export earner, rose in  New York .  Russia’s currency appreciated 0.8 percent to 27.5448 per
dollar as of 11:05 a.m. in Moscow, its highest intraday level
since May 5. The ruble was 0.4 percent weaker at 39.9525 per
euro, leaving it 0.2 percent stronger at 33.1174 against the
central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Oil climbed as President Barack Obama’s warning that the
U.S. debt stalemate threatens to damage the economy weakened the
dollar, boosting the appeal of commodities and countering
concern the crisis will hurt demand. Crude for September
delivery increased 0.5 percent to $99.68 a barrel.  Oil prices  “continue to lend support to the Russian
bourses,” Johannesburg-based Tradition Analytics wrote in an e-
mailed note to clients.  Russian  government bonds  were little changed, leaving the
yield on the ruble Eurobond due in 2018 steady at 6.836 percent.
Non-deliverable forwards, which provide a guide to expectations
of currency movements and allow companies to hedge against them,
show the ruble at 27.7962 per dollar in three months, compared
with 27.9908 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
