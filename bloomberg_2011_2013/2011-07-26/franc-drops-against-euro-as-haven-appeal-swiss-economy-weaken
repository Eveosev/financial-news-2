(Corrects to franc fell in third paragraph.)  The Swiss franc depreciated against
the euro as a measure of the nation’s economy weakened,
lessening the currency’s haven appeal.  The currency strengthened for a second day against the
dollar to a record amid concern that U.S. political parties
won’t reach an agreement on the nation’s debt level. The
greenback dropped against 16 major currency peers tracked by
Bloomberg.  The franc fell 0.4 percent against the euro on weaker
economic data as UBS AG’s index of consumption, a track of
several indicators including credit card use, fell to 1.48 in
June from a revised 1.88 in May.  “The Swiss franc is no longer acting as a safe haven,”
said  Sebastien Galy , a senior foreign-exchange strategist at
Societe Generale SA in  London . “With a more positive outlook
towards the euro and questions being raised about the Swiss
economy, we can expect to see even more weakening of the franc
against the euro in the next few weeks”.  The Swiss currency advanced as much as 0.8 percent to 79.98
centimes per dollar, the strongest level on record, and traded
at 80.25 centimes as of 9:40 a.m. in London. The franc
depreciated against the common currency to 1.16360 per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
