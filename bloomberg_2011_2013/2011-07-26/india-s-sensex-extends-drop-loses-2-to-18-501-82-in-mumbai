Indian equities extended declines
after the  Reserve Bank  of India raised its benchmark  interest
rate  by a more-than-estimated 0.5 percentage point to quell the
highest inflation rate among major Asian economies.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index sank 2 percent to
18,501.82 as of 2:48 p.m. local time, set for its biggest drop
in five weeks.  The central bank raised the repurchase rate to 8 percent
from 7.5 percent, it said in a statement in Mumbai today. None
of the 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predicted
today’s decision. Twenty estimated a quarter-point rise, while
the remainder expected no change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
