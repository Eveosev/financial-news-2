The Czech Republic’s benchmark stock
index fell the most in three months as concern the U.S. may
default and worse-than-expected earnings at European companies
hurt investor demand for riskier assets.  The PX equity gauge slid 1.6 percent to 1,186 at its 4:27
p.m. close in Prague, its biggest one-day drop since April 12.
Czech power producer  CEZ AS (CEZ) ,  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  and  Komercni
Banka AS (KOMB) , which have a combined 60 percent weighting in the
index, each lost at least 1.8 percent.  European stocks fell as BP Plc and UBS AG reported earnings
that missed forecasts. The dollar slid to its weakest ever
versus the Swiss franc and the cost of insuring U.S. debt rose
to a 17-month high after President Barack Obama dueled with
House Speaker  John Boehner  over the government’s debt limit.  “While the markets count on the ceiling being raised at
the last minute, people are increasingly nervous,” Vaclav France, an analyst at Raiffeisenbank AS in Prague, wrote in an
e-mailed report to clients today. “It doesn’t look like a
consensus will be reached soon.”  Austria’s Erste tumbled for a third day to 811 koruna after
saying yesterday it may have to abandon using affiliated savings
banks to bolster reserves under the European Union’s proposed
capital rules. CEZ fell 1.8 percent, the most in a month, to 860
koruna. Komercni, the Czech unit of Societe Generale SA, slumped
the most in two months, retreating 2.3 percent to 3,938 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
