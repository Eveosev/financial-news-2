German power for next year may rise,
bucking two days of losses, according to  technical analysis  by
 Societe Generale  SA.  The European benchmark contract may rebound from a so-
called 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level from a high of
60.45 euros ($87.55) a megawatt-hour on May 31 and a low of
56.25 euros on June 24, Carine Hemery, a Paris-based analyst at
Societe Generale, said today in an e-mailed report.  “Buy German power baseload calendar 2012,” Hemery said in
the report. “The contract decreased to the 38.2 percent
Fibonacci retracement level. It should rebound from this
level,” she said.  German 2012 power climbed as much as 15 cents to 57.85
euros a megawatt-hour, according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg, It was unchanged at 57.80 euros as of 10:25 a.m
Berlin time.  Traders watch for “technical” patterns in daily price
fluctuations, such as moving averages and Fibonacci levels, for
clues to the future direction of prices. Fibonacci analysis is
based on the theory that prices tend to drop or climb by certain
percentages after reaching a high or low.  The contract’s 50-day moving average was poised to move
below the 100-day average, according to price charts. The
convergence of the moving averages is a sell signal in the
medium term, Hemery said.  German power for next year has risen 4.7 percent this month
as utilities increased buying to cover for reduced generation
from nuclear closures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
