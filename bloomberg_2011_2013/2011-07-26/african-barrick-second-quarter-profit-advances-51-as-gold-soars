African Barrick Gold Plc, the
largest producer of the metal in  Tanzania , said second-quarter
profit gained 51 percent on rising bullion prices. The shares
climbed the most in more than a year in London.  Net income increased to $69.8 million in the period from
$46.2 million a year earlier, the London-based company said
today in a statement. Attributable gold output fell 4 percent to
171,950 ounces.  Gold producers’ profits have been buoyed by record prices
for bullion as  Europe ’s sovereign-debt woes spur demand for
precious metals as a haven. Gold for immediate delivery averaged
$1,509.22 an ounce in the second quarter, compared with
$1,196.53 an ounce a year earlier.  African Barrick’s sales rose 39 percent to $311.8 million,
while costs per ounce increased 20 percent to $652. The gold
miner maintained its full-year production guidance of 700,000
ounces to 760,000 ounces.  The shares rose 31.9 pence, or 6.5 percent, to 521 pence by
the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , the steepest gain since March
2010, when the company was spun off by the world’s biggest gold
producer, Barrick Gold Corp.  African Barrick expects to increase annual output to more
than 1 million ounces by 2014. It operates four mines in
Tanzania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
