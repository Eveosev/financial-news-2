Anoop Mehta, chairman of Mohit
Diamonds Pvt., a polished gem exporter, and president of the
Bharat Diamond Bourse, comments on the outlook for demand and
borrowing costs after  India ’s central bank raised its benchmark
 interest rate  by a more-than-estimated 0.5 percentage point.  The  Reserve Bank  of India increased the repurchase rate to
8 percent from 7.5 percent, it said in a statement today. None
of the 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predicted
today’s decision. Twenty estimated a quarter-point rise, while
the remainder expected no change.  Mehta spoke today in an interview.  “That’s going to slow the local economy down for sure.
If the whole economy slows down, I am sure that property
and diamonds are the two things which would slow down. Diamonds
are not an immediate requirement, you need it for weddings and
things like that.  On borrowing costs:  “Partly it will raise costs for the local diamond
operators, but as far as exporters are concerned, the government
has allowed us to borrow in dollars, so it doesn’t really make
that much difference because the dollar interest rates have not
yet moved.  On impact on costs:  “It will affect us because when inflation comes in, all
local supplies that we are using, the costs will go up. All
local inputs,” such as transportation and salaries, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
