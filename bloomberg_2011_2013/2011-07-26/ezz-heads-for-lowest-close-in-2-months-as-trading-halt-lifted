Ezz Steel (ESRS)  fell to the lowest level
in more than two months as the shares resumed trading after a
one-day suspension because of failure to disclose consolidated
2010 financial results.  The stock retreated 4.6 percent to 9.21 Egyptian pounds at
the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, the lowest level since May 17. The
shares have declined 53 percent this year, giving the company a
market value of 5 billion pounds ($839 million). The benchmark
EGX30 Index retreated 0.4 percent.  The Egyptian Exchange has given Ezz Steel 10 more days to
report consolidated earnings. On July 6, the exchange granted
the company and its subsidiary El Ezz Aldekhela Steel 15 days to
report 2010 results or face the trading halt. Ezz Steel is
waiting for its subsidiary to report results before providing
the consolidated numbers, it said in a statement.  El Ezz Aldekhela’s results are awaiting approval from
 Egypt ’s Central Auditing Agency, Ezz Steel said in the statement
made public by the exchange today. The unit is 53 percent owned
by Ezz Steel as of the end of 2010, according to Bloomberg data.
El Ezz Aldekhela’s shares remain suspended.  Ezz Steel said July 19 it expected the board of El Ezz
Aldekhela to approve the company’s results “on, or around”
July 24, and for Ezz Steel to report its results one week later.
Ezz Steel said last week its 2010 annual profit fell 53 percent
to 116.1 million Egyptian pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
