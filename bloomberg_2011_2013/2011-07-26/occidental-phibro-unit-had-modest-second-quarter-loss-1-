Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) ’s Phibro
oil trading unit had a “modest loss” in the second quarter,
Chief Executive Officer Stephen Chazen said on a conference call
today.  The unit, which Occidental bought for $250 million from
Citigroup Inc. in 2009, is still profitable for the year so far,
Chazen said. Phibro, run by Andrew J. Hall, trades oil, natural
gas, metals and agricultural commodities, according to its
 website .  “There’s no sense in watching it,” Chazen said of
Phibro’s profits. “It’s like an NBA game. You may as well tune
in in the last 30 seconds and forget the rest.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
