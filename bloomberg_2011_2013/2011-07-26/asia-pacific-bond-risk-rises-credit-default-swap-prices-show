The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed 2.5 basis points
to 118 basis points as of 10:03 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Credit Agricole CIB prices.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 2 basis points to 117 basis points
as of 8:03 a.m. in  Hong Kong , prices from Credit Agricole show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 1.5 basis points to
120 basis points as of 9:02 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG
prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
