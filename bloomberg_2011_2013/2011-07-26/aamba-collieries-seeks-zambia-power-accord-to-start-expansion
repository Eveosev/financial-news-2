Maamba Collieries Ltd., the largest
 coal mine  in Zambia, is seeking permission to sell power to
state-run utility Zambia Electricity Supply Corp. before it can
proceed with an expansion of its coal-fired electricity plant.  Maamba Collieries, owned by  India â€™s  Nava Bharat Ventures
Ltd. (NBVL) , has submitted a request to sell output from the 300-
megawatt expansion to ZESCO, the Energy Regulations Board said
today in an e-mailed statement. It already has commitments for
the first 300-megawatt phase of the $700 million power plant.  The company needs regulatory consent before obtaining
financing for the planned expansion. It expects to complete the
project 36 months after contractors begin work.  The regulator has also received a request from ZESCO to
sell power to Botswana Power Corp. for distribution to the
Kasane border area through the Kazungula supply line, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
