OAO  Uralkali (URKA)  slipped for a second
after OAO Acron Chairman Alexander Popov said the company may
sell a third of its 2.7 percent stake in  Russia ’s largest potash
maker in 2011 and the rest within three years.  The stock lost 0.4 percent to 274.27 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close of trading in Moscow. Uralkali earlier slid as much
as 1.5 percent.  Acron, a Russian nitrogen-fertilizer maker, may sell a
third of its 2.7 percent stake in Uralkali through the market
this year, and the rest within three years, Popov said today in
the Murmansk region. The holding is worth about $800 million at
today’s stock price, Popov said. Uralkali’s market value is 844
billion rubles ($30.6 billion), according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
