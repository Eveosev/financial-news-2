The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments dropped 4.5 basis points to 261.5 at 12 p.m. in
London. A decline signals improvement in perceptions of  credit
quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 5
basis points to 425, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 1.5 basis points to 113.75 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers declined 3 basis points to 169 and the
subordinated index dropped 6 to 297.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
