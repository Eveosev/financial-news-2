Vietnam ’s five-year bonds fell,
pushing yields to the highest level in four weeks, on
speculation the government will raise the rate at which it sells
debt to attract buyers. The dong gained.  State-owned Vietnam Bank for Social Policies failed to sell
any of the 2 trillion dong ($48.6 million) of three- and five-
year bonds it offered at an auction on July 21 as investors
sought yields higher than what it was willing to pay, Hanoi
Stock Exchange said in a statement on its website.  “Investors are expecting coupon rates in the primary
market to rise because the rates now are not high enough to lure
buyers,” said Vu Anh Duc, a Hanoi-based senior fixed-income
dealer at Vietnam Bank for Industry and Trade, also known as
Vietinbank.  The yield on five-year bonds rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 12.53 percent, the highest since June
27, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong strengthened 0.1 percent to 20,580 per dollar as
of 4:37 p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices from banks compiled
by Bloomberg. The central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,608
today. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of the official rate.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
