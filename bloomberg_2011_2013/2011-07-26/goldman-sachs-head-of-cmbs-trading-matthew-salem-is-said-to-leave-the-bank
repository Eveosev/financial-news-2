Matthew Salem, head of commercial-
mortgage bond trading at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., has left the
bank, according to a person familiar with the situation.  Salem joined the New York-based firm from Morgan Stanley in
January 2006, according to records from the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  Michael DuVally , a spokesman for  New York- 
based Goldman, declined to comment. Salem said he couldn’t
comment.  The fifth-biggest  U.S. bank  by assets is cutting about
1,000 jobs after reporting a plunge in fixed-income revenue last
quarter that was bigger than analysts expected. The company’s
mortgage businesses were among those that produced
“particularly” lower revenues, Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar said on a July 19 conference call.  “Our mortgages results reflected the negative impact of
asset-price declines, reduced market liquidity and divergence
between our cash positions and corresponding hedges,” Viniar
said.  Goldman Sachs and Citigroup Inc. sold $1.5 billion in
commercial-mortgage backed securities last week after
overhauling the deal to ease investor concern that the ratings
didn’t accurately reflect risks. The securities were issued with
the highest yields since sales of the debt revived in November
2009 as  Europe ’s debt crisis and debate over the U.S. debt
ceiling roiled markets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
