The British pound erased its decline
against the euro and extended gains versus the dollar after a
report showed U.K.â€™s gross domestic product expanded in the
second quarter.  Sterling was little changed at 88.34 pence per euro as of
9:35 a.m. in  London , after weakening by as much as 0.6 percent
to 88.84 pence. It increased 0.8 percent to $1.6406.  To contact the reporter on this story:
