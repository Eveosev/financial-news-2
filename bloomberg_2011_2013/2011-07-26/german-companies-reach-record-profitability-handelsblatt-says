Germany ’s biggest car, energy and
chemical companies have overtaken global peers in profitability,
spurred by the country’s economic boom,  Handelsblatt  said,
citing profit-margin data compiled by the newspaper.  Germany’s 50 biggest companies boosted the net income
margin last year to 4.8 percent from 1.8 percent, a record-high
level that beat companies in other countries for the first time
in the survey, Handelsblatt reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
