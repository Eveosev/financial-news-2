It costs more to insure U.S.
Treasuries for one year than for five years for the first time,
as investors anticipate that a failure to raise the debt ceiling
will prompt rating companies to declare the nation in default.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that one-year credit-default
swaps spiked to a record 80 basis points today, according to BNP
Paribas SA, up from 46 basis points on July 22. The contracts
now exceed five-year swaps by 23 basis points.  A political impasse in  Washington  could delay debt or
interest payments, triggering a payout on swaps and a loss of
the nation’s AAA credit rating. Longer-term debt insurance is
typically more expensive than shorter-term protection, and an
inversion of the swap curve signals concern there’s an imminent
risk of default.  “We’re one week away from the drop-dead date and they
haven’t reached solution, so technical default is becoming more
probable,” said Greg Venizelos, a strategist at BNP Paribas in
 London . “Inversion means there’s short-term concern for
default, which is exactly what’s happening in the U.S.”  Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said the U.S. will
run out of options to prevent a default on Aug. 2 unless the
borrowing limit is increased. The standoff increased the
probability  Standard & Poor’s  will downgrade the U.S. within
three months to 50 percent, the company reiterated on July 21.  Swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a borrower
fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
