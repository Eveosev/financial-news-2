Italian and Spanish 10-year bonds
fell and benchmark German bunds advanced, widening the
difference in yield between the securities, after debt sales by
the Mediterranean nations.  The Spanish 10-year bond yield increased four basis points
to 6.07 percent as of 10:32 a.m. in  London , widening the spread
to bunds by six basis points to 333 basis points.  The Italian 10-year bond yield climbed six basis points to
5.72 percent. The Italian-German spread rose to 298 basis
points.  Italy auctioned six month bills at the highest yield in
almost three years, while  Spain  sold 2.89 billion euros ($4.2
billion)of three-month bills and six-month bills compared with a
maximum target of 3 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
