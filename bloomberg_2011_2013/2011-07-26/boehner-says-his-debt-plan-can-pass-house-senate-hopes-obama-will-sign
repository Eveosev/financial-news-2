House Speaker  John Boehner  said his
two-step plan to raise the nation’s debt limit and cut spending
can pass both chambers of Congress, and he hopes President
 Barack Obama  would sign it.  The plan “can pass the House, and it can pass the
Senate,” Boehner told reporters after a meeting of House
Republicans today. “We are going to have some work to do to get
it passed, but I think we can.”  The House plans to vote tomorrow on Boehner’s plan and will
vote the following day on a constitutional amendment to require
a balanced budget.  Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy of California noted that
during his speech Obama “did not say he’d veto” Boehner’s
bill.  Gene Sperling , the director of the White House National
Economic Council, indicated earlier today that Obama would veto
the Republican plan with its short-term six-month increase.  “The president has been pretty clear that he does not find
that acceptable,” Sperling said in an interview on MSNBC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
