Putnam Investments LLC, the Boston-
based money-management firm, hired Aaron Cooper and Richard
“Shep” Perkins from  Fidelity Investments  for its equity
research and international equities units.  Cooper, 33, who was Fidelity’s managing director of
research, will serve as Putnam’s director of global equity
research and co-manager of the Putnam Research Fund and Putnam
Global Sector Fund, the company said today in an e-mailed
statement. Perkins, 40, who ran Boston-based Fidelity’s Mid-Cap
Stock Fund since 2005, will co-manage Putnam’s Global Equity
Fund. Both will be based in Boston.  “The arrival of Aaron and Shep will only enhance our
capabilities in key areas and further position our investments
team for long-term success,” Walter Donovan, Putnam’s chief
investment officer, said in the statement.  The moves are the latest in a series of personnel changes
under Chief Executive Officer Robert Reynolds, a former Fidelity
vice chairman who joined Putnam in 2008. Reynolds hired Donovan,
former head of equities at Fidelity, in April 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
