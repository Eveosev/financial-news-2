Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s
largest automaker, is looking for a site for a new engine
factory in Mexico, said Ana Maria Vallarino, the company’s
spokeswoman in Mexico.  “Toyota has expansion plans in  North America  and it is
examining and analyzing different locations for a new plant, but
it has not made a decision yet and there is not a deadline for
it,” Vallarino said today in a telephone interview from Mexico
City.  Vallarino commented on a report published in Mexico City-
based newspaper Reforma saying that representatives from Toyota
and Honda Motor Co. visited the central state of Guanajuato to
look for locations for new plants. The paper did not reveal the
source of its information.  Honda’s press office in  Mexico  City declined to comment on
the report.  Honda has a plant in Mexico’s southwestern state of Jalisco
and Toyota opened a factory in 2004 in the border city of
Tijuana, according to their websites.  To contact the reporter on this story:
