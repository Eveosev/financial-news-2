Italian and Spanish 10-year
government bonds rose after  Italy  canceled debt sales, citing a
surplus of cash.  Ten-year debt advanced for the first time in three days
after Italy said yesterday it would cancel an auction of medium-
to long-term bonds scheduled for mid August “considering the
large cash availability and the limited borrowing requirement.”
Italian two-year notes fell after demand slid at a bill sale.  “The environment is highly fragile and volatile, that’s
what you see today,” said Norbert Aul, a European rates
strategist at  RBC Capital Markets  in London. “The Italian
auction cancellation provided some relief,” though today’s debt
sales provided some negative market reaction, he said.  The yield on 10-year Italian bonds slipped three basis
points to 5.63 percent as of 5:05 p.m. in  London , reversing an
earlier increase to 5.72 percent. Similar-maturity Spanish
yields dropped seven basis points to 5.96 percent, after rising
to as much as 6.07 percent.  Benchmark bund yields fell two basis points to 2.74
percent. The 3.25 percent security maturing in July 2021 rose
0.205, or 2.05 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 104.365.  Bill Auctions  The difference in yield between Italian and Spanish bonds
and their German counterparts, narrowed for the first day in
three. The Italian 10-year security yielded 289 basis points
more than similar maturity bunds, while the Spanish-German
spread declined to 321 basis points.  Italy said it sold 7.5 billion euros ($10.9 billion) of
six-month bills at an average yield of 2.269 percent, the
highest in 2 1/2 years. Investors bid for 1.56 times the debt
offered, down from 1.72 times in June.  Spain  auctioned 2.89
billion euros of three- and six-month bills, with yields rising
and demand falling from a sale in June, data from the Bank of
Spain showed.  “If you think that the market is buying into the EU summit
of last week then you’d expect to see better T-bill auctions,”
said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “The auction
yields were significantly higher than last time round. Demand
for Spanish paper does look weaker.”  The six-month Spanish bills drew an average yield of 2.519
percent, with the so-called stop-out rate, the highest yield
paid, 13 basis points higher at 2.65 percent.  Greek Bailout  Euro-region leaders seeking to stem the region’s debt
crisis, decided on 159 billion euros of new aid for  Greece  last
week and new powers for the 440 billion-euro rescue fund. Banks
will voluntarily agree to write down the value of their Greek
securities by 21 percent as part of the bond exchange and debt
buyback program, the  Institute of International Finance  said
July 22.  German bunds advanced for a third day as investors sought a
refuge from turmoil in the U.S. debt market. President  Barack
Obama ’s administration and Republican lawmakers remain at an
impasse on raising the debt ceiling to avoid a default.  German government bonds handed investors 1.6 percent this
year, compared with 3.3 percent for  U.S. Treasuries  and 0.1
percent for Spanish debt, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Italy’s bonds have lost 2.5 percent, while  Portugal ’s
have declined 23 percent, the indexes show.  Deutsche Bank AG had net sovereign risks related to
Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain of 3.67 billion euros
as of June 30, a decline of 70 percent from the 12.1 billion
euros at the end of 2010, the bank said today in its second-
quarter earnings. The bank had a 155 million-euro writedown
related to Greek  government bonds , it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
