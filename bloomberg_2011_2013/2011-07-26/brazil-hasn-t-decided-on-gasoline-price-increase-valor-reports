Brazil hasn’t yet decided if there
will be an increase in gasoline prices, Energy and Mines
Minister Edison Lobao told the Valor newspaper.  A possible price rise is only a “hypothesis,” Valor cited
Lobao as saying today on its Web site.  Jose Sergio Gabrielli, chief executive officer of state-
controlled  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , told Globo TV that the
company may need to “adjust” prices because international
prices are high and fuel imports have increased.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
