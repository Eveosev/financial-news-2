Following is the text of the
new home sales report from the Commerce Department.  Sales of new single-family houses in June 2011 were
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 312,000, according
to estimates released jointly today by the U.S. Census
Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban
Development. This is 1.0 percent (+/-12.5%)* below the
revised May rate of 315,000, but is 1.6 percent (+/-
14.1%)* above the June 2010 estimate of 307,000.  The median sales price of new houses sold in June
2011 was $235,200; the average sales price was $269,000.
The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at
the end of June was 164,000. This represents a supply of
6.3 months at the current sales rate.  New Residential Sales data for July 2011 will be
released on Tuesday, August 23, 2011, at 10:00 A.M. EDT.  * 90% confidence interval includes zero. The Census Bureau
does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude
that the actual change is different from zero.  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department.
