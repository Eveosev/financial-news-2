Oil fell in  New York  on speculation
rising U.S. crude stockpiles indicate fuel demand is faltering
in the world’s biggest consumer of the commodity.  Futures dropped as much as 0.5 percent after the industry-
funded  American Petroleum Institute  said inventories climbed
3.96 million barrels to 358.2 million last week, the biggest
increase in three months. An Energy Department report today may
show supplies decreased 2 million barrels, according to a
Bloomberg News survey. Prices failed to settle above $100 a
barrel yesterday on concern the U.S. may default amid a standoff
over the country’s $14.3 trillion debt limit.  “The main driver of the oil market will be the demand and
supply situation,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a commodity-derivatives
sales manager at broker Newedge Group in  Tokyo , who predicts oil
will trade between $97.50 and $101.50 a barrel this week.
“Prices may be range-bound until the American debt issue is
resolved.”  Crude for September delivery slid as much as 54 cents to
$99.05 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . It was at $99.31 at 2:58 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract yesterday climbed 39 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $99.59,
after trading above $100 for the third time in four days.
Futures have gained 28 percent in the past year.  Fuel Supplies  Brent oil for September settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange fell as much as 24 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $118.04 a barrel. The European benchmark contract
was at an $18.97 premium to New York futures, down from a record
$22.63 on July 14.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles probably increased for a second
week, gaining 400,000 barrels in the seven days to July 22,
according to the median estimate of 14 analysts surveyed before
the Energy Department report today.  Oil rose yesterday after an index of U.S. consumer
confidence rebounded from an eight-month low and the dollar fell
on concern the country may default. A weaker greenback bolsters
the investment appeal of commodities as a hedge against
inflation.  The U.S. currency slumped against most of its major peers
today before the U.S. House votes on a plan to cut  government
spending  in exchange for raising the debt ceiling. The dollar
sank to record lows of 87.65 cents per  New Zealand dollar  and
$1.1063 per Australian dollar. Spot gold climbed to an all-time
high of $1,625.70 an ounce.  ‘Not Panicking’  “Some currency influence is coming into the oil market,”
said Hasegawa at Newedge. “But gold and oil are quite different
and oil investors are not panicking at the moment.”  Crude in New York is declining as it may have advanced too
quickly based on technical charts. The 14-day stochastic
oscillator is above 80, indicating futures are at so-called
overbought levels, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  An area of showers and thunderstorms associated with a
tropical wave over the northwestern  Caribbean Sea  has a 40
percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next 48
hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in an advisory.
The  Atlantic hurricane season  is monitored by the oil and gas
industry because of the potential impact on production areas
including the  Gulf of Mexico .  To contact the reporters on this story:
