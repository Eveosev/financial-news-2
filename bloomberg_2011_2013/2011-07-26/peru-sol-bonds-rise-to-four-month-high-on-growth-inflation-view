Peruvian sol bonds rose to a four-
month high as traders bet President-elect Ollanta Humala’s
government will spur growth and contain inflation.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 6.23 percent at 12:20 p.m. New York time,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose
0.10 centimo to 111.04 centimos per sol, the highest since March
16.  Demand for the Andean nation’s securities increased after
Humala said July 17 he will keep central bank President Julio
Velarde in that post and also appointed as finance minister
Miguel Castilla, who resigned as deputy finance minister this
month, said Manuel Aldave, head of investments at Banco
Internacional del  Peru .  “The appointments of Velarde and Castilla support the
continuity of economic policies, which has allowed the yield
curve to fall,” Aldave said.  The sol was unchanged at 2.7365 per  U.S. dollar .  To contact the reporter on this story:
