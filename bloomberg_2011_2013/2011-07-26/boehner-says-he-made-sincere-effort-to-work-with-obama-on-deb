House Speaker  John Boehner  said he
made a “sincere effort” to work with President Barack Obama on
a plan to raise the debt limit, and he said the president
created the “crisis atmosphere” surrounding the issue.  “The president has often said we need a ‘balanced’
approach -- which in  Washington  means: we spend more, and you
pay more,” Boehner said in response to Obama’s televised speech
tonight. “The sad truth is that the president wanted a blank
check six months ago, and he wants a blank check today. This is
just not going to happen.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
