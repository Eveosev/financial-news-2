Saudi Arabia  granted $1 billion to
support Jordan’s economy and cover its  budget deficit , the
Amman-based Al Arab Al Yawm newspaper reported today.  The donation increases to $1.4 billion the total amount of
Saudi grants to Jordan this year, the newspaper said, citing an
unidentified official. Saudi Arabia is due to give additional
assistance to Jordan, including oil grants at preferential
prices, it said.  Jordan, one of the smallest economies in the Middle East,
imports almost all of its energy needs and relies on foreign
investment and grants to support its budget and current-account
deficits. The government has increased public salaries,
subsidies and purchases of oil products since protests broke out
as part of this year’s regional turmoil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
