TNK-BP,  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Russian oil venture
with a group of billionaires, said it’s poised for record annual
profit after second-quarter earnings rose 82 percent on prices.  “We are looking at our best year ever” if  oil prices  hold
up, Chief Financial Officer  Jonathan Muir  said today in Moscow.  Net income grew to $2.11 billion in the quarter from $1.16
billion a year earlier, TNK-BP said in documents handed to
reporters. Sales expanded 47 percent to $15.4 billion.  While TNK-BP said oil and gas output was little changed at
1.758 million barrels a day, the price of Urals crude,  Russia ’s
main export oil blend, rose 48 percent to an average $113.87 a
barrel from a year ago, according to Bloomberg data. Annual net
income may beat the prior record of $6.63 billion in 2006, Muir
said, when it was buoyed by a $2.92 billion gain on asset sales.  The company’s performance is spurring owners to hold onto
their stakes despite conflicts between shareholders. AAR, a
group representing BP’s billionaire partners, this year blocked
a $7.8 billion share swap and Arctic exploration accord between
BP and OAO Rosneft. AAR also rejected a $32 billion offer for
its half of TNK-BP, said a person familiar with negotiations who
declined to be identified because they weren’t public.  “Neither BP nor AAR want to sell,”  Alexander Nazarov , an
oil and gas analyst at OAO Gazprombank, said by phone from
Moscow. “Even with cash, the challenge would be finding a
better investment for it in Russia.” TNK-BP is one of Russia’s
best companies strategically and operationally, he said.  The Moscow-based oil producer said today it earned net
income of $4.54 billion in the first half of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
