A hearing into doping allegations
against three-time Tour de France winner  Alberto Contador  was
postponed until later this year to allow further written
submissions, sport’s top court said today.  The hearing into the Spanish rider, who tested positive for
the banned substance clenbuterol after winning last year’s tour,
will probably be rescheduled for November, the Lausanne,
Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport said today in
an e-mailed statement. The hearing was scheduled for Aug. 1-3.  “The second round of written submissions will allow the
parties to complete their evidence and arguments relating to
some specific scientific issues,” the court said in the
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
