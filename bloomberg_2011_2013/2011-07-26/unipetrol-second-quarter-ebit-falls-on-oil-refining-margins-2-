Unipetrol AS (UNIP) , the  Czech Republic ’s
largest oil refiner, expects quarterly earnings before interest
and taxes to drop from the previous period after refining
margins shrank.  Second-quarter crude oil throughput jumped 27 percent from
the previous quarter and was up 3 percent compared with the
year-earlier period, the Prague-based company said today in a
trading statement sent by e-mail.  Profit for turning crude oil into fuel in the three-month
period “collapsed” to 30 cents a barrel from $1.60 a barrel
reported in the first quarter amid rising oil prices, Unipetrol
said. The refiner is scheduled to release full second-quarter
earnings on Aug. 5.  “The performance of the refinery segment will be
negatively affected by low refinery margins,” Bohumil Trampota,
an analyst at J&T Banka AS in  Prague , said in a note today. The
bank is in the process of revising Unipetrol’s rating and target
price.  Currency swings will shave off about 150 million koruna
($8.9 million) from Unipetrol’s profit in the second quarter,
according to the statement. Trading carbon dioxide allowances
will add about 200 million koruna to operating profit, the
company said.  Unipetrol shares fell 1.7 percent to 170 koruna at 12:13
p.m. in Prague. The stock has lost 14 percent of its value this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
