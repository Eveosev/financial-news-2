India’s government bonds tumbled the
most in 15 months and stocks had the biggest slide in five weeks
after the central bank boosted borrowing costs more than
economists estimated to tackle inflation.  Yields on 10-year debt surged to an eight-week high after
the  Reserve Bank of India  raised its repurchase rate by 0.5
percentage point to 8 percent in the 11th increase since March
2010, the nation’s fastest credit-tightening on record.  ICICI
Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the second-biggest lender, lost 3.2 percent, pacing a
drop among its peers.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the owner of Jaguar Land
Rover, slid 3.3 percent. The rupee rose on optimism higher
interest rates will attract foreign investors.  “It will have serious implications on economic growth,
consumer demand and corporate earnings,” Aneesh Srivastava, who
oversees $465 million as chief investment officer at IDBI
Federal Life Insurance Co., said from Mumbai. “We will hold
cash for now.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent government bond due April 2021
rose 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 8.44 percent
in the biggest jump since April 2010. The Bombay Stock Exchange
Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost 1.9 percent to 18,518.22 at
3:30 p.m. in Mumbai, the most since June 20. The rupee rallied
0.5 percent to 44.1875 per dollar, after earlier touching
44.2150, near the strongest level since April 11.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index decreased 1.9 percent to 5,574.85.
Its July futures closed at 5,577.3. The BSE 200 Index retreated
1.6 percent to 2,301.06.  None of the 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted
 Reserve Bank  Governor Duvvuri Subbarao’s decision today. Twenty
estimated a quarter-point addition, while the remainder expected
no change.  ‘Unpleasant Surprise’  “This was an unpleasant surprise since the market expected
25 basis points,” said J. Moses Harding, a Mumbai-based
executive vice president at IndusInd Bank Ltd. “The 8.40 yield
seems here to stay as the top of the range.”  Ten-year bond yields in India have jumped 48 basis points
this year, the most in  Asia , and touched a 32-month high of 8.46
percent in May. That widened the rate gap over U.S. Treasuries
to 531 basis points from a low of 436 on April 8.  Reserve Bank’s Subbarao moved even as counterparts in  South
Korea ,  Malaysia  and  Indonesia  refrained from raising rates this
month on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis and the slowing U.S.
recovery will damp global economic growth.  India ’s inflation,
which quickened to 9.44 percent in June, may remain at an
“elevated level for a few more months,” the central bank said
today as it raised its forecast for wholesale-price gains to 7
percent by March 31 from 6 percent.  ‘Not the End’  “While the 50 basis points hike was an aggressive move,
this is not the end of it,” Leif Lybecker Eskesen, Singapore-
based chief economist for Indian and ASEAN at HSBC, wrote in a
research note published after the Reserve Bank’s rate decision.
“The RBI is seriously concerned about anchoring inflation
expectations and we expect that the policy rate will reach at
least 8.25 percent this year.”  ICICI Bank dropped to 1,040.6 rupees and its July futures
settled at 1,041.30 rupees. Rival  State Bank of India (SBIN)  slid 2.7
percent to 2,446.05 rupees.  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) ,
the biggest mortgage lender, lost 2 percent to 693.95 rupees.
The Bombay Stock Exchange Bankex index sank 2.5 percent in the
biggest slide since May 23.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) , the biggest developer,
slumped 4.1 percent.  Valuation Gap  The Sensex lost 9.7 percent this year, the worst performer
after  Brazil  among key indexes in the world’s 10 biggest
markets, amid rate increases. Companies on the measure are
valued at 15 times estimated earnings, compared with a multiple
of 11 for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  Three out of 12 Sensex companies that posted earnings for
the June quarter have lagged behind analyst estimates, compared
with 33 percent that did so in the previous three months.  “Higher rates will hurt growth across sectors,” said
Vikas Khemani, president and head of institutional equities at
Mumbai-based Edelweiss Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. “We expect a
further 3 percent to 4 percent downside for stocks as they price
in high  interest rates .”  Overseas funds bought a net 5.25 billion rupees ($118.8
million) of Indian equities on July 22, raising their total
purchases this year to 99.8 billion rupees, according to data on
the  website  of the  Securities and Exchange Board of India .  To contact the reporters on this story:
