Ukraine’s grain harvest will come to
as much as 45 million metric tons, about 4 percent more than
previously estimated, because of a favorable climate and
increased corn sowing, the national weather center said.  “The forecast was raised only due to corn” after the
state statistics office published planting figures this month,
Tetiana Adamenko, head of the agricultural department at the
Hydrometeorology Center, said by phone today from Kiev. “Corn
condition is very good and soil moisture is better than last
year.”  Until now, the center predicted a 43.2 million-ton corn
crop. Sowing of the grain increased 34 percent this year to 3.63
million hectares (9 million acres), the statistics office said
July 13. It had projected planting on 3.46 million hectares a
month earlier.  Ukraine’s grain harvest fell at least 6 million tons short
of estimates last year after dry summer weather reduced yields.
Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said last week the
harvest will probably be 47 million tons in the current
marketing year that started July 1.  National grain stockpiles declined 13 percent to 4.3
million tons as of July 1, including 900,000 tons of corn,
according to the statistics office. Carryover stocks came to 1.9
million tons for wheat and 1.1 million tons for barley, it said
July 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
