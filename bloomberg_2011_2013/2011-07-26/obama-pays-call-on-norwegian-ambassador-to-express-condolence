President  Barack Obama  and Vice
President Joe Biden visited the Norwegian ambassador’s residence
in Washington today to personally convey condolences for the
terrorist bombing and shooting that killed at least 76 people.  “No words can ease the sorrow but please know that the
thoughts and prayers of all Americans are with the people of
Norway and that we will stand beside you every step of the
way,” Obama wrote in a condolence book.  A suspect in the July 22 twin attacks, Anders Behring Breivik, is in custody and his lawyer said today in Oslo that he
should be tested for mental illness. It was Norway’s worst
atrocity since World War II.  Breivik began eight weeks of pre-trial detention today
after he admitted a shooting rampage and car bombing intended to
inflict the “greatest possible loss” to the ruling  Labor Party 
and halt what he sees as the “Islamization” of Norway and
Europe  To contact the reporter on this story:
