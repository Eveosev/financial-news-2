Morgan Stanley bought European
gasoline barges from Trafigura Beheer BV. Gasoil dropped on
 London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Light Products  Gasoline barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $1,053 a metric ton, according to a
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus bulletin
board. That’s within trades at $1,047 to $1,055 yesterday.  The deals are for Eurobob grade fuel, to which ethanol is
added before being sold to motorists. So-called barge deals are
for lots of about 1,000 or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s crack, or premium to  Brent crude , was at $8.44 a
barrel, versus $8.21 yesterday, according to PVM Oil Associates
Ltd., a crude and refined products broker in London.  Naphtha’s discount to Brent was unchanged at $5.89 a
barrel. That’s the smallest gap since May 27, when the spread
was $4.82 a barrel.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil futures for August delivery were $1.50, or 0.2
percent, lower at $977.25 a ton on the ICE exchange as of 12:46
p.m. London time. The contract is used as a benchmark for
heating oil, diesel and  jet fuel .  The fuel’s crack, a measure of refining profit, fell to
$13.43 a barrel, compared with $13.57 at 4:30 p.m. yesterday.  Refinery  Repsol YPF SA,  Spain ’s largest oil company, started
processing units yesterday at its Petronor refinery in Bilbao
following the end of a four-day strike.  “A sequential start up of different production units is
taking place,” according to a statement today on the refinery’s
 website . The refiner said on July 21 that some units would be
halted on that day until July 25 because of  strike action .  To contact the reporter on this story:
