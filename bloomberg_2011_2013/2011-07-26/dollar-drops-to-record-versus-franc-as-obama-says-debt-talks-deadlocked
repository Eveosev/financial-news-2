The  U.S. dollar  fell to a record
versus the Swiss franc as President Barack Obama said the two
sides of American politics have reached a stalemate on raising
the debt ceiling.  Obama urged that a reduction in tax breaks should be part
of the solution, saying that some Republicans are urging a
spending-cuts only approach.  The dollar slid to as low as 80.14 Swiss centimes and
bought 80.33 as of 10:09 a.m. in Tokyo from 80.61 yesterday in
 New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
