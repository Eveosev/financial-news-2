Canadian stocks fell the most in 11
months, led by oil and raw material producers, as the U.S.
stalemate on raising the debt limit persisted.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ,  Canada ’s largest oil and gas company,
declined 2.7 percent as oil fell after an unexpected increase in
U.S. supplies.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s biggest producer
of the metal, dropped 2.1 percent as bullion futures fluctuated
after three days of gains.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , Canada’s
second-largest lender by assets, decreased 2.1 percent as
investors including BlackRock Inc. and Franklin Templeton
Investments said the U.S. faces losing its top-level debt rating
from  Standard & Poor’s  or Moody’s Investors Service.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index retreated 267.89
points, or 2.0 percent, to 13,032.67 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, the
biggest decline since Aug. 11.  “It’s a reflection of the jitteriness we’re seeing,”
Laura Wallace, a  money manager  in the private client division at
Scotia Asset Management, said in a telephone interview. Scotia
oversees C$10 billion ($10.5 billion). “We don’t have a
resolution to the debt and there is concern about what the
impact of an S&P downgrade would be.”  The S&P/TSX slipped less than 1 point this month through
yesterday as gold producers rose and financial companies dropped

country’s debt ceiling. U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  has said the U.S. will run out of options to prevent a
default on Aug. 2. Seventy-five percent of Canadian exports went
to the U.S. last year, according to  Statistics Canada .  Oil Inventories  Crude oil lost 2.2 percent in  New York  after the U.S.
