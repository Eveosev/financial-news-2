U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said the U.S. needs to remove the threat of default
posed by the $14.3 trillion debt limit.  “The most important thing we can do right now to safeguard
financial stability is lift the cloud of default hanging over
our economy,” Geithner said in a statement today. Geithner’s
comments were made as the Treasury Department released the first
report to Congress of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.  The council’s report calls for financial-sector reforms
mandated by the Dodd-Frank law, including wind-down plans and
heightened risk management for large financial firms. Geithner
is chairman of the council, which also includes Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke .  Republicans and Democrats in Congress are trying to round
up votes for rival plans aimed at raising the debt ceiling
before Aug. 2, when the Treasury says the U.S. will exhaust its
borrowing authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
