Senegal’s President Abdoulaye Wade
named Cheikh Gueye as the minister in charge of February’s
presidential election after the opposition said the interior
minister was too political to undertake the task.  Gueye is the inspector general of state and the former
director general of elections, Cire Ly, spokesman for the
Interior Ministry, said by phone from the capital, Dakar, today.  Senegal’s opposition coalition, Bennoo Siggil Senegal, had
called for Wade to remove Interior Minister Ousmane Ngom from
his post saying that as a member of Wade’s Senegalese  Democratic
Party  he should not organize the elections. Cheikh Gueye is not
a member of the party.  On June 23, violent protests broke out across the capital
when Wade proposed amending the constitution to reduce the
winning threshold for elections to 25 percent from 50 percent.
Parliament also considered creating a vice presidential post,
the holder of which would automatically assume the post of
President in the event of his death.  Critics suspect Wade, 85, proposed the changes to ensure
his son, Karim Wade, a future role as president. Wade dropped
the proposed changes in the wake of the riots, which were the
most violent since he took power in 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
