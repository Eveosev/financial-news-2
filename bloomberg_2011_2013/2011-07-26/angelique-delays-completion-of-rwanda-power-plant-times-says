Angelique International Ltd. delayed
the commissioning of a 28-megawatt hydropower plant in  Rwanda 
after it took longer than expected to move residents off the
land to be used for the facility,  New Times  reported.  The plant, which was scheduled to be built by 2013, will
now be completed by February 2014, the Kigali-based newspaper
said, citing Naresh Kapoor, chief project officer at Angelique.  To contact the reporter on this story:
