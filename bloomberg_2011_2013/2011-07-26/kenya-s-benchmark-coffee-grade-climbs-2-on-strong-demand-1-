The price for  Kenya ’s benchmark
coffee grade climbed 2 percent at today’s auction because of
demand from a major buyer, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.  The top AA grade sold for an average of $465.59 per 50-
kilogram (110-pound) bag, compared with $456.59 at the previous
sale, the exchange said by e-mail.  The grade sold for as much as $544 a bag compared with $510
last week, while its supply climbed 28 percent to 846 bags, the
agency said.  The average price for all the coffee sold fell 3.2 percent
to $323.89 a bag, due to an increase of supplies, the exchange
said.  “Prices for AA climbed because there was good demand by
one of the buyers,” David Muriithi, the agency’s acting chief
executive, said by phone from Nairobi, without giving details.
It “may be this particular buyer had pending orders.”  Sales at the auction fell 5.6 percent to 7,619 bags valued
at $3.01 million, from 8,072 bags worth $3.30 million last week,
Muriithi said.  Bean supplies rose 32 percent to 18,867 bags from 14,325
bags due to warm conditions which help dry crops, the exchange
said.  The country harvests the bulk of its crop from October
through December, while a secondary crop is reaped from April to
June.  The following are details of today’s auction in U.S.
