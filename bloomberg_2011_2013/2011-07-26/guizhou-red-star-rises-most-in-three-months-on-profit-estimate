Guizhou Red Star Developing Co. gained
the most in more than three months in  Shanghai  trading after
forecasting an 800 percent increase in first-half profit.  The chemical manufacturer and marketer, based in the
southwestern province of Guizhou, rose by the 10 percent daily limit
to 18.91 yuan, the biggest one-day increase since April 8.  China ’s
benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.5 percent.  Net income for the first six months will increase more than 800
percent from 4.55 million yuan a year earlier, the company said in
a statement filed to Shanghai’s stock exchange, without giving a
figure for what profit may be. Increased demand for its products in
China and overseas helped spur the profit gain, the company said.  --Charles Li. Editor: John Liu  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
