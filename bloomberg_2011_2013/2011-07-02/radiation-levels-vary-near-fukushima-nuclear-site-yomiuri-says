A government team found wide
differences in radiation levels within the 20-kilometer
exclusion zone around the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
plant, the Yomiuri newspaper reported today.  The highest reading of 39.1 microsieverts an hour was
recorded on the surface of an unpaved road, the paper said.
Readings were lower on paved roads, and one such spot recorded 2
microsieverts an hour, it said.  A standard chest X-Ray exposes an individual to 50
microsieverts of radiation, according to Japanese government
data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
