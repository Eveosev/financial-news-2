ACWA Power International, a Saudi
Arabia-based company that develops electricity and water
projects, plans to raise $300 million through a Murabahah
facility by the end of the year.  ACWA accepted commitments of $210 million for the Islamic
loan from Standard Chartered Bank,  Citigroup Inc. (C) , Bank of
America Merrill Lynch and  Mizuho Corporate Bank , it said in an
e-mailed statement yesterday. ACWA is in talks with two other
banks to raise the figure to $300 million, it said.  Payment of interest is forbidden under Islamic law. To
comply, banks and companies use contracts such as Murabahah,
where lenders buy an asset on behalf of the customer and sell it
back at a mark-up.  The facility will be used to fund projects outside  Saudi
Arabia , according to the  statement  from ACWA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
