German bund yields jumped the most in
seven months this week as demand for the safest assets ebbed,
while bonds from  Europe ’s most indebted nations rebounded amid
waning concern that  Greece  will default.  Spanish bonds climbed, pushing the 10-year yield down the
most in five months. Greece’s bonds gained for a second week as
German banks lined up behind plans to roll over their Greek debt
while the Mediterranean nation’s lawmakers approved a budget-
cutting package. Italian 10-year bonds gained for the first week
in three as Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s cabinet passed
deficit-cutting measures worth 47 billion euros ($68 billion).  “Market fears of a near-term default in Greece faded this
week as the Greek government passed the austerity bill, which
should pave the way for more funding in the next few weeks,”
said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital
Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “Consequently, the flight-to-quality
bid for bunds has diminished and peripheral bonds have
rallied.”  The 10-year bund yield climbed 21 basis points over the
week to 3.04 percent as of 4:45 p.m. in  London  yesterday. That’s
the biggest weekly increase since the five trading days ending
Aug. 7, 2009. The 3.25 percent security due July 2021 fell
1.805, or 18:05 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,453) face amount, to
101.76. Yields on two-year notes advanced 30 basis points to
1.65 percent, their biggest weekly gain since August 2009.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won a vote to
implement a 78 billion-euro package of tax increases and asset
sales, paving the way for further financial aid. The nation may
get as much as 85 billion euros in new financing, including a
contribution from private investors, in a second bailout,
according to an Austrian Finance Ministry official.  ECB Decision  “Optimism about Greece has pushed bund yields higher this
week,” said  Peter Chatwell , a strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in London.  Spain ’s 10-year yield fell 30 basis points to 5.39 percent.
Italy’s 10-year bond yields dropped 10 basis points to 4.87
percent, while yields on similar-maturity Greek securities fell
46 basis points.  German notes may fall further next week as the  European
Central Bank  raises borrowing costs. The ECB will lift its
refinancing rate to 1.50 percent from 1.25 percent on July 7,
according to the median estimate of 38 economists in a Bloomberg
survey.  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  reiterated on June 30
that policy makers are in a state of “strong vigilance”
against inflation, a phrase he has used before previous
tightening. The central bank raised its key rate in April by a
quarter point to 1.25 percent, the first increase in almost
three years.  A rate increase “has to hit the front end” of the German
bond-yield curve, Chatwell said, referring to short-term notes.  Trichet’s comments will be closely watched, as “there are
question marks over whether the ECB will press ahead with more
rate hikes later this year,” Chatwell said.  German  government bonds  have handed investors a loss of 0.2
percent this year, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while
Spanish bonds have returned 2.7 percent. Greece’s debt has
dropped 15.6 percent and  Italy ’s has returned 1.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
