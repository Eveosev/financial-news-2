RWE AG (RWE)  is seeking “fair
compensation” for damages caused by Germany’s plan to phase out
nuclear energy, Chief Executive Officer  Juergen Grossmann  told
Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.  A moratorium on nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster
cost the company 150 million euros ($218 million) and RWE faces
additional damages from shorter running times of nuclear plants
and an “unjustified” nuclear fuel tax, Grossman said in an
interview. He didn’t specify an amount of compensation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
