Chelsea has placed Samir Nasri on its
list of potential targets after hints the midfielder is ready to
leave Arsenal, the  Daily Mail  said.  Nasri is in the final year of his contract and has rejected
a five-year deal worth 90,000 pounds ($144,666) per week, the
Mail said. Chelsea is trying to sign Udinese winger Alexis
Sanchez and sees Nasri, who’s been linked with  Manchester United 
and Manchester City, as a viable alternative, the newspaper
said.  Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger would like to sell Nasri
abroad, but the 24-year-old is understood to favor a move to
United, the Mail said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
