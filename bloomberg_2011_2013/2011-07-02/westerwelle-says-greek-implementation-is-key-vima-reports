German Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  said focus will now be on  Greece ’s implementation of
the budget measures approved by Parliament in the past week,  To
Vima newspaper  reported, citing an interview.  The Parliament’s approval gives the government an
opportunity to “stabilize the country’s economy,” and
implementation is the main element in steadying Greece and the
common European area, the Athens-based newspaper reported
Westerwelle as saying. Debt can’t be tackled with new borrowing
but with fiscal discipline and reforms, Westerwelle said.  The foreign minister said he had never considered Greece
leaving the euro area, Vima reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
