Kesa Electricals Plc (KESA)  is considering
whether to halt the planned sale of its Comet chain and
restructure the business itself,  The Times  reported.  Knight Vinke Asset Management LLC, which owns 20 percent of
Kesa, is urging the company to demerge Comet and leave it as a
U.K.-listed entity on concern that it would only be sold at a
loss, the London-based newspaper said, citing people close to
the situation.  “We’re sticking to our plan announced by the chairman only
a week ago,” Simon Ward, head of  investor relations  at Kesa,
said in a phone interview today. Ward declined to say if Knight
Vinke was urging the company to drop the sale of Comet.  Kesa may insist on extracting concessions from Comet’s
landlords if the sale doesn’t proceed, the Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
