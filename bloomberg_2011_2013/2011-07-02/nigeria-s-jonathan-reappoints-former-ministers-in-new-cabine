Nigerian President  Goodluck Jonathan 
appointed 14 new cabinet members, including 12 former ministers
who will be returning to their old portfolios, state-owned
national television said today.  Diezani Alison-Madueke returns as energy minister in
Africa’s largest oil producer, while Mohammed Adoke and
Shamsudeen Usman return as justice and national planning
ministers, respectively.  Lawmakers have so far approved 14 members of a 34-member
cabinet proposed by Jonathan after winning elections in April.
Ex-Finance Minister Olusegun Aganga is among the proposed
members and is due to appear before a senate hearing next week.  Jonathan has pledged to invest in roads and railways and
reform the  petroleum industry , the mainstay of the economy, to
boost growth. His new government must also deal with growing
insecurity. While an armed insurgency in the oil-producing Niger
River delta remains subdued, parts of the north have been hit by
violence by the radical Islamic sect, Boko Haram, inspired by
 Afghanistan ’s Taliban movement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
