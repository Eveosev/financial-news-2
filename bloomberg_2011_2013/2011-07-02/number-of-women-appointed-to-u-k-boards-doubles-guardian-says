The number of women appointed to the
boards of Britainâ€™s biggest companies has more than doubled,  The
Guardian  reported, citing data from the Cranfield School of
Management.  FTSE 100 companies have recruited 23 women to their boards
this year after former U.K. trade minister  Mervyn Davies  said a
quarter of board members must be women by 2015, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
