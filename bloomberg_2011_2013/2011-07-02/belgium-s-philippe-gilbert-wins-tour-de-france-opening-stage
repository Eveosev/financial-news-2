Belgium ’s Philippe Gilbert won the
opening stage of the  Tour de France , finishing more than a
minute ahead of defending champion  Alberto Contador .  Gilbert, of the Omega Pharma-Lotto team, finished the
191.5-kilometer (119-mile) ride between Passage du Gois and Mont
des Alouettes in the Vendee region of western France, in a time
of 4 hours, 31 minutes and 31 seconds.  Australian Cadel Evans of BMC Racing was three seconds back
in second place, with Norway’s Thor Hushovd of the Garmin-
Cervelo team a further three seconds behind in third place.  Three-time winner Contador of Spain, riding for the Saxo
Bank team, was involved in a late crash and finished as part of
a group 1 minute, 20 seconds behind Gilbert. The Spaniard will
next month face an appeal before the Court of Arbitration for
Sport of his acquittal by the Spanish cycling federation for
doping at last year’s Tour.  Tomorrow’s second stage is a 23-kilometer time trial in Les
Essarts. The Tour ends July 24 on the Champs-Elysees in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
