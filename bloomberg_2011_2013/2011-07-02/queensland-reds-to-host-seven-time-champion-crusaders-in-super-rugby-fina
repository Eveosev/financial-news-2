The  Queensland Reds  will face the
seven-time champion Canterbury Crusaders in next week’s Super
Rugby final.  Australia’s Reds secured home advantage for the July 9
championship game in Brisbane by beating the Auckland Blues 30-
13 yesterday. New Zealand’s Crusaders defeated the Stormers 29-
10 in Cape Town in the other semifinal.  The Crusaders will have to win one final away game to
extend their title record in southern hemisphere rugby’s elite
provincial competition. They’ve played on the road all season,
including taking one home game to  London , after Christchurch’s
AMI Stadium was damaged in the Feb. 22 earthquake that killed
more than 180 people in New Zealand’s second-biggest city.  Sean Maitland and Robert Fruean scored tries for the
Crusaders, while  Dan Carter  kicked five penalties and two
conversions. Brian Habana touched down for the Stormers.  The Reds, who topped the regular-season standings, are
seeking their first Super Rugby championship. Queensland won
back-to-back Super 10 titles before the sport went professional
in 1995.  Rod Davies touched down three times as the Reds outscored
the Blues four tries to one. Ben Tapuai also scored a try and
Quade Cooper kicked 10 points.  The competition this year split into Australian, New
Zealand and South African conferences and added the Melbourne
Rebels as the 15th franchise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
