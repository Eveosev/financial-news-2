Iran â€™s Revolutionary Guard has
smuggled new weapons to its allies in  Iraq  and Afghanistan in
recent months,  The Wall Street Journal  reported, citing unnamed
senior U.S. officials.  The military elite in the Islamic Republic has transferred
rocket-assisted exploding projectiles to militia in Iraq and
long-range rockets to the Taliban in Afghanistan, in the hope of
accelerating the U.S. withdrawal from these countries, the paper
reported. The weapons have already been used to kill American
troops in Iraq, the Journal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
