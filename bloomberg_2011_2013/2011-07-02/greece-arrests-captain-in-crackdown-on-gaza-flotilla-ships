Greek authorities arrested the
captain of a U.S.-flagged ship intending to travel to the  Gaza
Strip  a day after a blanket ban was imposed on the vessels
leaving Greek ports.  The 60-year-old captain of the “Audacity of Hope” was
arrested early today, according to a statement from the Athens-
based  Citizen’s Protection Ministry . The man, whose name wasn’t
released, will answer to charges related to infringements of the
criminal and merchant marine codes on July 5, according to the
statement.  Greece  banned ships intending to travel to the Gaza Strip
from leaving the country’s ports yesterday, and the government
ordered the coast guard to take “all appropriate measures” to
enforce the decision. The ships are part of a flotilla aimed at
breaking Israel’s blockade of the Gaza Strip.  The country’s coast guard is monitoring “the broader
maritime area” of the eastern Mediterranean for the ships
participating in the campaign, according to yesterday’s
statement. The organizers have said they will carry aid.  The Athens-based ministry said in a separate statement
today that a group of about 30 protesters gathered at the port
of Agios Nicolaos in Crete and chanted slogans after the
‘Tahrir’ vessel was banned from sailing. They later dispersed
peacefully.  Israel  said it won’t allow the flotilla to reach the Hamas-
controlled Gaza Strip. A previous Gaza flotilla’s attempt ended
in violence in which nine Turks were killed on May 31 last year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
