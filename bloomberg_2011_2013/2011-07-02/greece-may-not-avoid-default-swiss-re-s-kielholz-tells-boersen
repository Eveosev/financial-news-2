Greece ’s efforts to reduce its debt
may not be enough to avert a default, Swiss Reinsurance Co.
Chairman Walter Kielholz told Germany’s  Boersen-Zeitung  in an
interview.  “The measures are necessary but they are probably not
sufficient,” Kielholz was quoted as saying. “Certain market
participants are currently still assuming a partial default,
which is reflected in the prices for Greek government bonds.”  Kielholz said he still considers U.S. Treasuries the safest
investment, the newspaper wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
