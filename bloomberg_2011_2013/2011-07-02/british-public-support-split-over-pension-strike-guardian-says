British public support for this
week’s strike action in the U.K. over pensions is split,
according to the  Guardian , citing a poll of 2,022 people.  Forty-one percent of respondents said the strike by
teachers and civil servants was justified, while 42 percent said
it wasn’t and the rest didn’t know, the Guardian reported. ICM
Research interviewed people age 18 or older online on June 29
and 30, according to the report.  Four unions with 750,000 members staged a one-day strike on
June 30 to fight proposals for government employees to retire
later and contribute more to their pensions. The government says
the changes are essential to make pensions sustainable and help
trim the U.K.’s fiscal deficit.  Of those polled, 43 percent said the government was right
to make public-sector pensions less generous and 39 percent said
it was wrong, according to the report. Thirty-two percent of the
respondents said they would support any call from unions for
more strikes and 46 percent said they would be opposed, the
Guardian said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
