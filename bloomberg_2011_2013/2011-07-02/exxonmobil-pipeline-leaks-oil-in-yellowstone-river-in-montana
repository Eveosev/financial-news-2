An  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  pipeline leaked
crude oil early today into the Yellowstone River in Montana, the
company said in a statement.  The spill from a 12-inch line operated by Exxon Mobil
Pipeline Co. is being investigated, and the cause isn’t known,
Rachael Moore, a company spokeswoman, said in a separate e-
mailed statement.  “We are not going to speculate” on how much oil escaped
into the river, Moore said. “Right now our focus is on
containing the crude release and getting it cleaned up.”  The fire department of nearby Laurel, Montana, evacuated
some homes amid concern of possible explosions, Moore said. The
pipeline runs from Silver Tip in south-central Montana to
Billings, the company said.  Oil flowed from the pipe for about 30 minutes before it was
stopped, the  Associated Press  reported earlier, citing Pam Malek, an Exxon spokeswoman.  The pipeline supplies refineries in the Billings area, the
AP said, citing Peters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
