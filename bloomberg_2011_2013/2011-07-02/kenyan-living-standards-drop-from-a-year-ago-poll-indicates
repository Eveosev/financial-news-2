Almost 84 percent of Kenyans have
experienced a drop in  living standards  from a year ago as rising
food and fuel prices reduce disposable incomes in the country,
the  Daily Nation  reported, citing an Infotrak survey.  Inflation in East Africaâ€™s largest economy rose to 14.5
percent in June, the Nairobi-based newspaper reported today. The
rate has climbed for eight consecutive months.  The research company surveyed 2,400 Kenyans between May 27
and June 2, the newspaper said, citing Chief Executive Officer
Angela Ambitho, without providing the margin of error.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
