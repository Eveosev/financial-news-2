The pound posted its biggest weekly
decline in a month against the euro as signs that the U.K.
economic recovery is faltering reduced the scope for interest-
rate increases from the  Bank of England .  Sterling fell versus 12 of its 16 major counterparts
tracked by Bloomberg this week, losing most against the Swedish
krona and sliding to a 15-month low versus the euro. Reports
this week showed U.K. confidence fell and manufacturing growth
unexpectedly slowed in June while a Credit Conditions Survey by
the central bank predicted mortgage demand to drop in the third
quarter. Bank of England policy maker  Adam Posen  said on June 27
that a call by the  Bank for International Settlements  for higher
rates worldwide to curb inflation was “nonsense.”  “Sterling is being completely marginalized by the
worsening economic growth outlook in the U.K.,” said Peter Rosenstreich, chief foreign-exchange analyst at Swissquote Bank
SA in Geneva. “If we continue to see an erosion in growth
prospects then the possibility of rate hikes is virtually out of
the question.”  The pound slid 1.6 percent this past week to 90.35 pence
per euro as of 4:32 p.m. in  London  yesterday, from 88.90 pence
on June 24. It reached 90.84 on July 1, the weakest intraday
level since March 2010. Sterling gained 0.7 percent against the
dollar to trade at $1.6069, from $1.5959 at the end of last
week. Against  Japan ’s currency, the pound added 1.2 percent to
129.87 yen.  Interest-Rate Bets  Worsening economic growth has prompted traders to reduce
bets on higher rates, with the implied yield on short-sterling
futures expiring in March falling to 1.03 percent, down from a
nine-month high of 2.08 percent in February. Investors are
betting the central bank will raise borrowing costs next May,
according to forward contracts on the sterling overnight
interbank average, data from Tullett Prebon Plc show.  As recently as February, traders were betting on a rate
increase in May of this year, the data showed.  Barclays Capital  on June 30 pushed back its forecast for
interest-rate increases, saying the central bank will now
probably keep its main rate unchanged until May 2012. The bank,
which previously forecast a rate increase in November, said the
change reflects weaker than previously expected economic growth
and recent comments from central bank officials.  The pound has fallen 9 percent in the past 12 months,
making it the second-worst performer among 10 developed-market
currencies after the  U.S. dollar , according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  The U.K. currency may decline further next week should the
Bank of England keep its key interest rate at a record-low 0.5
percent on June 7 as predicted by all 51 economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  U.K. government bonds fell every day this week as efforts
by  Greece  to avoid a default curbed demand for the safest
assets. The decline pushed up yields on 10-year gilts by 27
basis points to 3.40 percent, while two-year note yields climbed
13 basis points to 0.83 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
