Kuwait ’s naval force has ended its
deployment to Bahrain, Kuwait’s state-run KUNA news agency
reported, citing the country’s military attaché in Bahrain.  “Kuwait’s navy contributed with a number of boats in
safeguarding Bahrain’s maritime borders as per the mutual
defense agreements between Gulf Cooperation Council states,”
Colonel Ali al-Asaker told KUNA. The GCC comprises Kuwait,  Saudi
Arabia , the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.  The navy was deployed as part of a Saudi-led Gulf force on
March 15, the day the Bahraini government declared a state of
emergency following weeks of mostly Shiite Muslim pro-democracy
demonstrations. Bahrain’s opposition and pro-government groups
today began a month of talks that aim to bridge the rifts
following the protests.  Shiite-Sunni tensions have flared up in Kuwait over the
past few months, partly due to the sectarian unrest in  Bahrain .
Kuwaiti Shiites rallied against sending ground troops to the
other Gulf Arab state, while Sunnis have demonstrated in favor
of this.  To contact the reporter on this story:
