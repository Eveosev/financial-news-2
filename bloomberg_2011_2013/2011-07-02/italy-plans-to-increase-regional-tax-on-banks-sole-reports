Italy’s government plans to increase
a regional tax on banks and financial institutions as part of
deficit-cutting measures approved June 30, according to  Il Sole
24 Ore .  The Irap regional corporate tax paid by banks will increase
by 0.75 percentage points, the daily newspaper reported, citing
a draft of the approved plan.  Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s Cabinet approved 47
billion euros ($68 billion) in deficit-cutting measures to try
to balance the budget by 2014 and protect Italy from the fallout
from  Europe ’s debt crisis. The government will seek to push it
through parliament in a confidence vote by the end of summer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
