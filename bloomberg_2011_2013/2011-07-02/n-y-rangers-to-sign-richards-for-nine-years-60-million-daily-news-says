The  New York Rangers  will sign free-
agent center Brad Richards to a nine-year, $60 million contract,
the New York Daily News reported on its website.  Richards led the Dallas Stars with 28 goals and 49 assists
last season, ranking 10th in the National Hockey League in
scoring. The Calgary Flames, Toronto Maple Leafs and  Los Angeles
Kings  were also interested in signing him, the Daily News said.  Richards, 31, will be reunited with coach John Tortorella,
who guided the center to a Stanley Cup title in 2004 with the
Tampa Bay Lightning. That year, Richards won the Conn Smythe
trophy as the MVP of the playoffs after registering a
postseason-best 26 points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
