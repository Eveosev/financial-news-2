Mike and Bob Bryan beat Robert
Lindstedt of  Sweden  and Horia Tecau of Romania, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6
(7-2) in the Wimbeldon final to equal the Australian pair Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde with 11 major doubles titles.  It’s the Americans’ second title at Wimbledon, where they
won in 2006, and came in their fifth final at the All England
Club. The 33-year-old twins have won five Australian Open titles,
three U.S. Opens and one French Open.  Last year, they set the record for the most titles by a
team since tennis went professional in 1968, with 62. Today’s
victory, in their record 19th Grand Slam final, makes it 73. The
top-ranked pair has been in one major tennis final each year
since 2003.  Bob Bryan plays lefthanded and Mike is righthanded. They
were born in  California , and now live in  Florida .  To contact the reporter on this story:
