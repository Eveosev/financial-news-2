The  Queensland Reds  beat the Auckland
Blues 30-13 to advance to the Super Rugby final.  Rod Davies touched down three times as the Reds outscored
the Blues four tries to one at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane. The
Australian club will host the July 9 championship game against
the winner of today’s second semifinal between New Zealand’s
Canterbury Crusaders and South Africa’s Stormers in  Cape Town .  The Reds, who topped the regular-season standings, are
seeking to win southern hemisphere rugby’s elite provincial
competition for the first time. Queensland won back-to-back
Super 10 titles before the sport went professional in 1995.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
