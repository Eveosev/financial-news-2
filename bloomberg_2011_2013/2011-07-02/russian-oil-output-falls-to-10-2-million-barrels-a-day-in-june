Crude output in  Russia , the world’s
largest oil producer, fell last month for the first time since
March.  Production fell to 10.2 million barrels a day in June,
according to preliminary data from the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK
unit received by e-mail today. That compares with output of
10.26 million barrels a day in May and 10.15 million barrels a
day in June 2010.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  has tasked the oil industry,
Russia’s largest source of  tax revenue , to keep output above 10
million barrels a day for at least the next decade. Production
has exceeded the level since September 2009 and reached 10.27
million barrels a day in October last year. Russia peaked at
11.48 million barrels a day in 1987, according to BP Plc data.  Russian natural gas output fell to 1.69 billion cubic
meters a day in June from 1.86 billion cubic meters a day the
previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
