The  New York Rangers  agreed to
contract terms with free-agent center Brad Richards, the 10th
leading scorer in the  National Hockey League  last season and a
former postseason most valuable player.  The Rangers didn’t disclose terms of the agreement in a
 statement . TSN network of Canada  reported  on its website that
Richards agreed on a nine-year, $60 million pact.  The NHL’s free-agent signing period began yesterday.  Richards, 31, made $7.8 million with the Dallas Stars last
season and led the team with 28 goals and 49 assists in 72 games.
He’s recorded 220 goals and 496 assists in 772 career games with
Dallas and the Tampa Bay Lightning.  Richards will be reunited with coach John Tortorella, who
guided the center to a Stanley Cup title in 2004 with  Tampa Bay .
That year, Richards won the Conn Smythe trophy as the MVP of the
playoffs after registering a postseason-best 26 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
