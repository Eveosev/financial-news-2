Naina Lal Kidwai, HSBC Holdings Plc’s
country head for  India , said lenders’ margins may come under
pressure after the central bank increased its key interest rate
last month.  The  Reserve Bank  of India increased the repurchase rate to
7.50 percent from 7.25 percent on June 16. The increase, the
10th since the start of 2010, extended the longest streak of
monetary tightening in a decade after inflation accelerated.  “There will be pressure on net interest margins of all
banks,” Kidwai said at an event in the eastern Indian city of
Kolkata. “If beyond a point we cannot pass on the interest-rate
hike to consumers, then banks will see a squeeze in margins
going forward.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
