The euro rose for the first time in
four weeks against the dollar as optimism  Greece  will solve its
sovereign-debt problems and stave off a default increased after
lawmakers approved fiscal austerity measures.  The 17-nation currency strengthened the most against the
Swiss franc in more than two years after Greek Prime Minister
 George Papandreou  won approval of two bills to authorize his 78
billion-euro ($113 billion) package of budget cuts and asset
sales, a key to receiving further international financial aid.
The Dollar Index fell the most since January and the franc
weakened against its 16 most-traded peers as investors sought
higher-yielding currencies. The  European Central Bank  is
forecast to raise  interest rates  next week.  “For the time being, Greece has side-stepped the specter
of a disorderly debt default, so that helped to spur a rally in
risky assets and that came at the expense of safe-haven
destinations, such as the dollar and Swiss franc,” said  Joe Manimbo , a market analyst in  Washington  at Travelex Global
Business Payments, a currency-exchange network. “Now that
Greece is somewhat less of an issue, the spotlight has shifted
onto the ECB, which appears poised to hike interest rates next
week.”  The euro rose 2.4 percent to $1.4526, from $1.4188 June 24,
and reached $1.4552, the highest level since June 9. It
strengthened 2.9 percent to 117.42 yen, from 114.13. The yen
fell 0.5 percent to 80.83 per dollar, from 80.43 last week.  Annual Gains  The euro has gained 3 percent this year against nine other
developed-nation currencies, according to Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Currency Indexes. The dollar has declined 6 percent,
while the yen has lost 5.6 percent.  The Greek votes came amid strikes and scuffles outside
parliament that saw police fire tear gas at demonstrators in
 Athens  protesting budget cuts and asset sales. A total of 155
lawmakers in the 300-strong chamber supported the laws.  German banks have agreed to roll over about 2 billion euros
in the Greek bonds they’re holding that mature through 2014,
German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said June 30.  German and French lenders are the biggest European holders
of Greek debt. European banks hold 17.2 billion euros of Greek
bonds maturing by the end of 2013, Citigroup Inc. estimated in a
June 23 report.  “There is a tremendous amount of institutional desire not
to see Greece default, and that is what the market is beginning
to understand,” said Boris Schlossberg, director of research at
the online currency trader GFT Forex in New York.  ECB Watch  The euro was also supported as traders increased bets the
ECB will raise its policy interest rate, pushing euribor futures
lower. The implied yield on the March 2012 contract rose four
basis points to 2.01 percent.  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said June 28 and 30 that
policy makers are in a state of “strong vigilance” ahead of
the July 7 meeting, a phrase he has used before tightening
monetary policy in the past.  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks
the dollar against the currencies of six trading partners
including the euro, yen and pound, fell 1.8 percent to 74.298,
from 75.665.  The Fed bought $4.9 billion of notes due from June 2017 to
June 2018 on June 30, marking completion of the central bank’s
$600 billion asset buy-back program in its second round of
quantitative easing.  Economic Indicators  Risk assets were boosted as the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s factory index showed July 1 that U.S. manufacturing
unexpectedly expanded at a faster pace in June, signaling a
decline in U.S. data may be moderating. The measure rose to 55.3
last month from 53.5 in May.  The manufacturing data and the end to the Fed’s purchase
program indicated that “the soft patch and QE2 does not appear
to be the beginning of a double dip,” said  Michael Woolfolk ,
senior currency strategist in  New York  at Bank of New York
Mellon Corp., the world’s largest custodial bank, with more than
$20 trillion in assets under administration.  U.S. employers likely added 100,000 jobs last month,
keeping the  unemployment rate  at 9.1 percent, according to the
median estimate of 64 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The
Labor Department will release the report July 8.  The franc tumbled against its major peers as investors
turned to riskier assets. The monthly gauge that aims to predict
the Swiss economy’s direction about six months ahead dropped to
2.23 from 2.30 in May, the KOF Swiss Economic Institute in
Zurich said June 29, also weighing on the currency.  Franc Slides  The Swiss currency lost 1.7 percent to 84.78 centimes per
dollar and reached a record high of 82.76 centimes on June 28.
It slumped 4.1 percent to 1.2316 per euro in the biggest drop
since March 2009.  New Zealand ’s dollar reached a record against the U.S.
currency after a survey by ANZ National Bank Ltd. showed a net
46.5 percent of companies expect the economy will improve over
the next year, up from 38.3 percent in May. The net figure
subtracts the number of pessimists from the number of optimists.  The kiwi, as the South Pacific island nation’s currency is
known, rallied 1.9 percent to 82.73 U.S. cents and reached
83.19, the highest level on record.  To contact the reporters on this story:
