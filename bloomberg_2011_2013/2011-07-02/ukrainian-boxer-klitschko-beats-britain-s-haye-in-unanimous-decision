Ukrainian boxer Wladimir Klitschko
won his 14th consecutive match yesterday with a unanimous
decision over Britain’s David Haye in a 12-round world
heavyweight bout in  Germany .  Klitschko, 35, already the holder of titles from the
International Boxing Organization, International Boxing
Federation and World Boxing Organization, took the World Boxing
Association championship belt away from Haye.  “I was trying to celebrate my 50th knockout though it
didn’t work out,” Klitschko said during a televised interview
from ringside at Imtech Arena in Hamburg. “I am celebrating
with my brother now that we have collected all belts in the
heavyweight division, however, it wasn’t as spectacular as I was
expecting.”  His older brother, Vitali, 39, owns the World Boxing
Council title that he will defend against Polish boxer Tomasz
Adamek on Sept. 10. Vitali is 42-2 with 39 knockouts.  Klitschko, at 6-foot-6 (1.7 meters) and 242.6 pounds (110
kilograms), had a size advantage over the 6-foot-3 Haye, who
weighed in at 212.8 pounds. The Ukrainian’s reach of 81 inches
was three inches longer than Haye’s.  “It was very hard to hit this man,” Klitschko said. “He
was definitely fast. He didn’t give me a lot of opportunity. He
was very cautious.”  Klitschko improved his record to 56-3 with 49 knockouts.
Haye, 30, fell to 25-2 with 23 knockouts.  More Aggression  “He was scared to fight me,” Klitschko said. “I was
expecting more fight in the ring, more aggression.”  Haye blamed his loss on his inability to execute his boxing
strategy because of a toe that he broke three weeks ago.  “It was nowhere near as good as I would have liked,” Haye
said. “I was unable to push off with my right foot. I broke my
toe.”  Haye said he kept dropping his hands to encourage his
opponent to attack.  “I gave it the best I could,” he said. “He was very big
and strong.”  Klitschko landed 134 of his 509 punches, while Haye
connected on 72 of his 290 punches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
