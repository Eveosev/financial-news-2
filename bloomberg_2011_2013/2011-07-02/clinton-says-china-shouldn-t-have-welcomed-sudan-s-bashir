U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  indirectly criticized China saying that countries should
not welcome Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir just days after
his visit to Beijing.  “We’ve made our view clear that countries should not be
welcoming the Sudanese president because of the charges against
him,” Clinton said today at a press conference in  Madrid .  The United Nation’s top human rights official criticized
China for not arresting Bashir for  war crimes  during a visit he
made to Beijing this past week.  China, a major Sudanese ally, rejected the criticisms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
