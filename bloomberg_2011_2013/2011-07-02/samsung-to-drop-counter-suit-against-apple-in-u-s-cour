Samsung Electronics Co. dropped a
patent-infringement suit against  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , filed at a U.S.
federal court in April in response to allegations its Galaxy
products copied the iPhone and iPad.  Samsung Electronics dropped the suit on June 30 “to
streamline the legal proceedings,” Nam Ki Yung, a spokesman for
the Suwon, South Korea-based company, said today in a telephone
interview. Samsung will continue to defend its  patent rights 
through a counter-claim in an earlier suit Apple filed at the
same court in San Jose, California, he said.  Litigation between the two companies, which compete in the
mobile-device market, is under way in at least five countries
including South Korea,  Japan , Germany and the U.K. Withdrawal of
the California suit won’t affect other U.S. cases or patent-
violation complaints Samsung raised against Apple in other
countries, Nam said.  “Samsung will continue to actively defend and protect our
intellectual property,” he said. Samsung is the world’s second-
largest maker of mobile phones.  Steve Park, a Seoul-based Apple spokesman, declined to
comment when called by Bloomberg News today.  Cupertino, California-based Apple sued Samsung at the  San
Jose  court in April, alleging Galaxy phones and tablet computers
“slavishly” copy the iPhone and iPad. Samsung, which supplies
memory chips to Apple, responded with counter-suits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
