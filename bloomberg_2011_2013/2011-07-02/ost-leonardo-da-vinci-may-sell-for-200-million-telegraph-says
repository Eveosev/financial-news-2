A painting newly attributed to
 Leonardo da Vinci  and once owned by King Charles I of England
may fetch a record 125 million pounds ($200 million) at auction,
 The Daily Telegraph  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The picture, entitled “Salvator Mundi” or “Saviour of
the World,” depicts Christ with one hand raised in blessing,
the Telegraph said. It is owned by a group of U.S. dealers, the
newspaper said.  Originally thought to have been painted by a da Vinci
protege, the painting will be displayed at  London ’s National
Gallery in November, the Telegraph reported. It’s then expected
to be offered for sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
