European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Christian Noyer  said proposals from French banks
for a rollover of Greek debt are “very good” and may make
Greece’s rescue program more credible, Proto Thema reported.  Noyer said the proposal is in the interests of all the
banks and financial organizations who could participate in a
Greek support plan, the Athens-based newspaper said, citing an
interview due to be published tomorrow, Sunday, July 3.  Greek state asset sales can raise income for Greece and tax
reform can support growth, the newspaper quoted Noyer saying.
 Europe  needs stronger governance overall and greater
harmonization of tax and social policies, the newspaper cited
Noyer as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story
