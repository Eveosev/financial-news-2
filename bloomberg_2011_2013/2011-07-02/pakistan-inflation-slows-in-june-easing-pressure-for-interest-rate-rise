Pakistan ’s inflation eased in June,
reducing pressure on the central bank to raise  interest rates .  Consumer prices rose 13.13 percent from a year earlier,
slowing from a 13.23 percent gain in May, the  Bureau of
Statistics  announced in Islamabad today. The median of nine
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 13.70 percent
increase.  The  State Bank of Pakistan  has kept its discount rate
unchanged this year at 14 percent, already one of the highest in
the world, to support economic growth. Pakistan’s $162 billion
economy, sapped by terrorism and floods in 2010, probably
expanded 2.4 percent in the year ended June 30, slower than an
earlier target of 4.5 percent, the government estimates.  “Inflation is showing no real sign of abating,” Suleman Akhtar, an economist at Foundation Securities Ltd. in Karachi,
said before the report. “Raising rates further would be tough,
given the weakness in economic expansion.”  The central bank has called for a tight fiscal policy to
ease inflationary pressures and signaled a further increase in
borrowing costs will undermine economic expansion. It raised
rates in three consecutive meetings from July to November.  Government borrowings have surged 74 percent to 685.3
billion rupees ($8 billion) since July 1, according to the
central bank.  Pakistan’s government last month pledged to cut the  budget
deficit  to a seven-year low of 4 percent of gross domestic
product in the year ending June 30, 2012, from 5.7 percent of
GDP in the previous 12 months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
