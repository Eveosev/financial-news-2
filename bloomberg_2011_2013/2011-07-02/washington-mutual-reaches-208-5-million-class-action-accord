Washington Mutual Inc. (WAMUQ) , the former
owner of the biggest  U.S. bank  to fail, and its former
executives, underwriters and auditor reached a $208.5 million
settlement of a class-action lawsuit by investors.  The settlement provides for $105 million in payments on
behalf of the individual defendants, $85 million from the
underwriters, and $18.5 million from Deloitte & Touche LLP,
according to a request for preliminary approval filed yesterday
in federal court in Seattle by lawyers for the Ontario Teachersâ€™
Pension Plan Board, the lead plaintiff in the case.  The lawsuit consolidates more than 20 cases claiming the
bank secretly lowered lending standards, artificially inflated
home-price appraisals and failed to disclose its deteriorating
financial condition when the loans began to fail.  Washington  Mutual, based in Seattle, filed for bankruptcy
on Sept. 26, 2008, the day after its banking unit was taken over
by regulators and sold to JPMorgan Chase & Co. for $1.9 billion.
It was the biggest bank to fail in U.S. history, with more than
2,200 branches and $188 billion in deposits.  The case is In re Washington Mutual Inc. Securities,
Derivative & ERISA Litigation, 2:08-md-01919, U.S. District
Court, Western District of Washington (Seattle).  To contact the reporter on this story:
