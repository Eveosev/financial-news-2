U.S. National Security Adviser Tom Donilon said terrorist leader Osama  bin Laden  “had some sort of
support mechanism” while operating out of Abbottabad, Pakistan,
for six years.  Donilon, in an interview scheduled to air today on CNN’s
“Fareed Zakaria GPS” show, said he had not seen evidence that
Pakistani “leadership elements” had knowledge of bin Laden’s
presence in Pakistan. That’s consistent with Donilon’s prior
statements.  “But the fact is, is that he operated there for an
extended period of time, and that raises a lot of questions,”
Donilon said in the CNN interview, according to a transcript
released today. “And those questions are being asked in
Pakistan.”  The  U.S. Congress  has been calling for more information on
whether the Pakistani military, government or intelligence
services aided bin Laden while he was in Abbottabad, about 35
miles from the country’s capital of Islamabad. The issue has
contributed to tensions in relations between the U.S. and
 Pakistan  during the past year.  U.S. Navy SEAL commandos killed bin Laden on May 2 in the
complex where he had been hiding. The raid capped a decade-long
pursuit of the al-Qaeda leader, whose network was responsible
for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.  U.S. intelligence agencies are currently examining computer
equipment found at the complex for leads on additional al-Qaeda
figures and their plans. Donilon, citing a Central Intelligence
Agency assessment, said in May that the information cache is
about the size of a small college library.  To contact the reporter on this story:
