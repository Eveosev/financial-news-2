BP Plc (BP/) ’s Whiting refinery in  Indiana 
continues to release higher-than-estimated emissions, according
to a  filing  with the National Response Center.  U.S. refineries must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.  Bloomberg News couldn’t immediately verify that the
information in the NRC filing was accurate.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
