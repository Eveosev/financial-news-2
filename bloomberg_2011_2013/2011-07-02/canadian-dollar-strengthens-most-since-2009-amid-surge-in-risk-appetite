Canada’s dollar had the biggest
weekly gain in 20 months versus its U.S. counterpart as rising
optimism that European leaders have staved off a default by
 Greece  fueled investor appetite for higher-yielding assets.  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is nicknamed for the
image of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, also strengthened as
data showing inflation climbed more than forecast spurred bets
the central bank will resume raising interest rates. The weekly
gain reversed losses for the month and quarter. Canada’s job
growth slowed last month, a report next week may show.  “Risk appetite, that’s the main driver of the Canadian
dollar,” said  Shaun Osborne , chief foreign-exchange strategist
at Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD Securities unit in Toronto. “One
of the big uncertainties that has been hanging over the market
lately has been a Greek default and a systemic problem in the
global banking system and that seems to have been removed now.”  The Canadian currency strengthened 3.1 percent to 95.85
cents per  U.S. dollar  yesterday in Toronto, from 98.86 cents on
June 24. It was the biggest gain since the 3.6 percent advance
for the five days ended Oct. 9, 2009. The loonie touched 95.81
cents yesterday, the strongest level since May 11, after
depreciating to 99.13 cents on June 27, the weakest in three
months. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0433.  Bonds Fall  Government bonds  dropped, pushing the yield on the
benchmark Canadian 10-year note up 26 basis points, or 0.26
percentage point, to 3.12 percent, from 2.86 percent on June 24.
It touched 3.14 percent yesterday, the strongest level since May
20. The price of the 3.25 percent security maturing in June 2021
tumbled C$2.27 to C$101.08.  Canada  will auction C$3.5 billion ($3.7 billion) of five-
year notes on July 6, according to a statement on a  Bank of
Canada  website. The 2.75 percent securities mature in September
2016.  The loonie gained 0.5 percent for June and appreciated 0.8
percent for the three months ended June 30, its fourth straight
quarterly advance. Until this week, it was headed for monthly
and quarterly declines as crude oil, Canada’s biggest export,
dropped and stocks slid amid concern Greece’s sovereign-debt
crisis would worsen. The currency has risen 4.1 percent in 2011,
while being outperformed by 11 of its 16 most-traded peers.  Commodities including oil had five-day gains for the first
time in a month as Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won
lawmakers’ approval of an austerity plan needed to keep
financial aid flowing to the debt-strapped nation and avert the
euro region’s first sovereign-debt default.  Commodities, Stocks  Canada’s dollar rose versus 15 of its 16 most-traded peers
this week as crude gained 4.2 percent to $94.94 a barrel in  New
York  and the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of  raw
materials  increased 2.1 percent. Raw materials including oil
account for about half of Canada’s export revenue. The Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index of stocks climbed 5.6 percent.  The loonie jumped on June 29 the most since December on an
intraday basis after  Statistics Canada  reported the  consumer
price index  increased at an annual pace of 3.7 percent in May,
the fastest since 2003, from 3.3 percent the previous month. A
Bloomberg News survey had forecast inflation would hold steady.  The currency climbed as much as 1.2 percent as the data
prompted traders to ratchet up bets the Bank of Canada will
resume raising  interest rates . The bank has held the benchmark
overnight rate at 1 percent since September after raising it
three times last year.  Rate Bets  The yield on December 2011 bankers’ acceptances increased
14 basis points, the biggest weekly gain since February, to 1.5
percent. It had touched 1.36 percent June 24, the lowest closing
since the contracts started trading in December 2008. The yield
on so-called Baxes averages about 18 basis points above the
central bank’s overnight target, Bloomberg data since 1992 show.  The CPI figure “has us believe that we will be seeing a
rate increase this calendar year,” said C.J. Gavsie, managing
director for foreign-exchange trading at Bank of  Montreal ’s BMO
Capital Markets unit in Toronto. “It certainly helped market
participants believe something will be happening much sooner in
Canada than in the U.S.”  Policy makers will raise the overnight rate to 1.25 percent
by the end of September and 1.5 percent by year-end, according
to the median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  The  Federal Reserve  will keep its benchmark rate at zero to
0.25 percent, where it’s been since December 2008, until the
second quarter of 2012, the median forecast in another Bloomberg
survey shows.  Advance May Continue  The Canadian interest-rate speculation may help the loonie
continue its advance in the next few weeks, Gavsie said.  The currency has weakened 1.7 percent this year versus
those of nine other developed-nation currencies tracked by the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The greenback
has lost 6 percent.  Canada’s dollar rose this week even as Statistics Canada
data showed gross domestic product stalled in April after
 Japan ’s record earthquake disrupted supply lines for Canadian
automobile production. GDP gained 0.3 percent in March. A
Bloomberg survey forecast a 0.1 percent contraction for April.  Employment growth slowed to a net 12,500 jobs in June from
22,300 in May, according to a Bloomberg survey before the
statistics agency reports the data on July 8. The  unemployment
rate  held at 7.4 percent, economists said.  Currency, bond and stock markets in Canada were closed
yesterday for the Canada Day holiday.  To contact the reporter for this story:
