Jordan’s  King Abdullah  ordered a
reshuffle of the cabinet today, the second government change
since pro-democracy protests started earlier this year.  Eleven new cabinet members in Prime Minister  Marouf Bakhit ’s government, including the interior, information and
justice ministers, were sworn in, the country’s state-run news
agency Petra said. The reshuffle falls short of demands by the
opposition, which organized large demonstrations yesterday to
demand the resignation of the Bakhit government.  Jordan’s opposition, led by Islamists, has been staging
demonstrations since the start of the year to demand
constitutional and political changes, as well as an end to
corruption. King Abdullah changed the government after street
protests and appointed Bakhit in February. The monarch has
promised to ease restrictions on political parties and allow the
formation of governments based on a parliamentary majority,
without saying when it will happen.  Three members of Jordan’s parliament resigned and another
54 said June 30 they will boycott house sessions in a dispute
over an alleged case of corruption linked to an abandoned plan
to build a casino in the Muslim country. The Islamic Action
Front, the largest opposition party in the kingdom, said Bakhit
and other ministers were involved in the project and demanded
the resignation of the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
