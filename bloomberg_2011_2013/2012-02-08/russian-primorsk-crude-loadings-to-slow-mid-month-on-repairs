Russian crude exports from the Baltic
Sea port of Primorsk will slow for several days in mid-February
because of planned pipeline maintenance, OAO Transneft said.  Loadings will be reduced to one tanker a day, Igor Dyomin,
a spokesman for the pipeline operator, said today by phone. One
100,000 metric-ton cargo is scheduled to load daily from Feb. 14
to Feb. 16 and on Feb. 18, while no shipments are scheduled for
Feb. 17, according to a preliminary loading plan obtained by
Bloomberg News on Jan. 26.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
