The  Dollar Index  is headed for a two-
month low after the currency gauge dropped below its 100-day
moving average, Nomura Holdings Inc. said, citing trading
patterns.  The index, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses to
track the U.S. currency against its six major counterparts, slid
as much as 0.8 percent to 78.488 yesterday, below its 100-day
moving average of 78.747.  “When it breaks through its 100-day moving average, it
tends to continue lower,” said Kurt Magnus, executive director
of currency sales in Sydney at Nomura,  Japan ’s biggest
brokerage, referring to the Dollar Index. “Pension funds and
real-money managers, who manage foreign exchange -- a lot of
them look at 100-day moving average.”  The Dollar Index was little changed at 78.559 as of 9:21
a.m. in  Tokyo . Magnus said the gauge will fall to 78.15, which
would be the lowest since Dec. 8.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
