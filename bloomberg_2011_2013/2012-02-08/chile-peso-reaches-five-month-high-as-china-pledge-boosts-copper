The Chilean peso rose to the
strongest level in five months as copper rallied on a pledge by
the Chinese central bank to support the housing market.  The peso gained 0.4 percent to 476.80 per  U.S. dollar  as of
10:12 a.m. in Santiago. It earlier reached 476.15, the strongest
on an intraday basis since Sept. 14.  Copper,  Chile ’s biggest export, rose as much as 1.4 percent
in  New York  after the People’s Bank of China said late yesterday
that officials will boost support for construction of affordable
housing. Higher-yielding assets including emerging-market
currencies and commodities appreciated against the dollar as
Greek political leaders neared agreement on a 130 billion-euro
($173 billion) rescue plan.  “Markets are still positive, copper keeps rising and
there’s no reason to bet against the peso,” said Eugenio
Cortes, head of currency forwards at EuroAmerica Corredores de
Bolsa SA in Santiago.  The peso will weaken to 480 per dollar in seven days,
according to the median forecast of 57 traders and investors in
a central bank survey published today.  Offshore investors in the Chilean peso forwards market had
a $4.5 billion bet against the currency on Feb. 6, the most in
two weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
