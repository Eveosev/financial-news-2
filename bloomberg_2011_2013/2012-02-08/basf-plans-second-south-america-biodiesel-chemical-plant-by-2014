BASF SE , the world’s biggest chemical
company, may start building its second factory in  South America 
for sodium methylate, a catalyst used for biodiesel production
within two years.  The plant will probably be built in Brazil or  Argentina 
where biodiesel consumption is mandated by law, said Kerstin
Dunnwald, head of business management for inorganic chemicals at
Ludwigshafen, Germany-based BASF.  South American countries are seeking to cut their
dependence on fossil fuel imports by mixing diesel with fuel
derived from crops, creating markets for companies that supply
ingredients necessary for its manufacture.  “This market will grow with increasing fuel demand,”
Dunnwald said in a telephone interview yesterday. “There are
discussions of increasing existing blends.”  The project may be similar in size to a 60,000-metric ton a
year plant the company started operating late last year in
 Brazil ’s southeastern municipality of Guaratingueta, she said.  Argentina mixes 7 percent of its conventional diesel with
biodiesel while Brazil mixes 5 percent, BASF said Feb. 6 in a
 statement .  The two countries are among the world’s top four producers
of the renewable fuel, Dunnwald said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
