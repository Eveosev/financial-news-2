Prime Minister Mario Monti’s work to
improve Italy’s public finances is “impressive” and a service
to  Europe ’s emerging economies, said  Thomas Mirow , president of
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  Monti’s measures are “the biggest service Italy can lend
to central and eastern Europe,” where the London-based EBRD is
focused, Mirow said in a telephone interview after meeting with
Monti in Rome today.  Sound public finances may enable Italy to continue
assisting the EBRD. Italy has contributed 116.6 million euros
($155 million) in the lender since 1992, mostly in technical
cooperation, according to the bank’s website.  Mirow also said the EBRD “shares the cautious optimism of
the markets” on the outlook for the sovereign debt crisis after
the  European Central Bank (EURR002W)  provided lenders with unlimited three-
year funding to avert a credit crunch in December. The ECB will
offer a second round of loans later this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
