Facebook Inc. (FB)  Chief Executive Officer
 Mark Zuckerberg  won’t have to give pretrial testimony in a
patent-infringement lawsuit filed by a mobile networking
company.  U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel in Manhattan today denied
a request by Wireless Ink Corp. to depose Facebook co-founder
Zuckerberg.  “If the CEO of  Facebook (FB)  has relevant knowledge not readily
available from other sources, Wireless Ink ought to be able to
establish this from documents produced in discovery or the
testimony of other employees of Facebook,” Castel said in his
order.  Wireless Ink, which operates the Winksite social networking
service, said in a complaint filed in 2010 that Facebook Mobile
and  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Google Buzz infringed a patent related to ways
of offering content on mobile devices.  Facebook’s lawyers said in a letter to the judge that
Wireless Ink “has not identified any relevant knowledge that
Mr. Zuckerberg uniquely possesses that cannot be obtained from
other witnesses.”  Facebook, based in  Menlo Park , California, is planning an
 initial public offering  of stock.  The case is Wireless Ink Corp. v. Facebook Inc., 10-01841,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
