Oil in  New York  climbed to the
highest level this month after the U.S. Energy Department
reported that supplies increased less than analysts forecast and
refineries bolstered fuel production.  Futures rose 0.3 percent after the report showed crude
 stockpiles  gained 304,000 barrels, less than the 2.5 million
barrels estimated in a Bloomberg News survey. Refiners ramped up
gasoline output on the East Coast, and  Brent crude  traded in
 London  jumped more than West Texas Intermediate oil in New York.  “The DOE report ended up having a few bullish features,”
said  Phil Flynn , an analyst at PFGBest in  Chicago . “Refiners
along the coast will have to spend more because Brent is higher
today. Brent is more important to them than WTI.”  Crude oil for March delivery increased 30 cents to $98.71 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement price since Jan. 30. Futures are up 14 percent from a
year ago.  Brent oil for March settlement climbed 97 cents, or 0.8
percent, to end the session at $117.20 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the highest settlement
since July 28.  The European benchmark was at a $18.49 a barrel premium to
West Texas Intermediate oil at the close of trading. The spread
was 67 cents wider than yesterday.  “Brent has taken the lead again,” said  Tom Bentz , a
director with BNP Paribas Prime Brokerage Inc. in New York.
“WTI was the big mover yesterday but Brent’s showing strength
now and that’s helping gasoline, since it moves with Brent.”  Gasoline for March delivery climbed 4.77 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $2.9752 a gallon in New York, the highest settlement
since Aug. 31.  Rising Inventories  Crude oil supplies rose to 339.2 million barrels in the
week ended Feb. 3, the highest level since October, the report
showed. Inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point of
WTI traded in New York, climbed 367,000 barrels to 30.5 million,
the most since Dec. 9.  “The gain may have been smaller than expected, but it’s
still another build,” said Todd Horwitz, chief strategist at
Adam Mesh Trading Group in New York. “Week after week we
continue to see supplies increase.”  Refineries operated at 82.8 percent of capacity, up 1
percentage point from the week before, the report showed.
Analysts projected there would be a 0.4 percentage point
decrease in utilization rates.  Gasoline production  rose 0.7
percent to 8.63 million barrels a day last week.  Fuel Supplies  Gasoline inventories  climbed 1.63 million barrels to 231.8
million last week, the department said today. Stockpiles were
forecast to rise 875,000 barrels, according to the median of 10
analyst responses in a Bloomberg News survey.  Supplies of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, gained 1.17 million barrels to 146.6
million. Stockpiles were forecast to fall 875,000 barrels.  Total fuel demand fell 0.5 percent to 17.6 million barrels
a day, the lowest level since 1999, the report showed.  Oil rose to the day’s high of $100.09 a barrel as Greek
leaders worked on a rescue plan with creditors. Prime Minister
 Lucas Papademos  began negotiating today with leaders of the
political parties supporting his caretaker government.  Papademos held an unscheduled meeting late yesterday with
the so-called troika, comprising the European Commission, the
 European Central Bank  and the  International Monetary Fund , to
put the final touches on terms required for a 130 billion-euro
($172 billion) rescue package.  ‘Psychological Warfare’  Ramin Mehmanparast, spokesman for the Iranian Foreign
Ministry, said yesterday that the latest U.S. sanctions against
his country’s financial institutions were “psychological
warfare.” President Barack Obama Feb. 6 ordered a block on
property and interests in property belonging to the Iranian
government, its central bank and all Iranian financial
institutions.  Iran  has said it may close the  Strait of Hormuz , the
transit point for about a fifth of global crude, after the
European Union announced Jan. 23 that it will implement an oil
embargo starting July 1 to pressure the Islamic republic over
its nuclear program.  “We’re waiting for the other shoe to drop in both the
Greek and Iranian situations,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at
Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on
energy.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 849,702
contracts as of 4:26 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 1.15
million yesterday, the highest level since Nov. 16 and 91
percent above the three-month average. Open interest was 1.48
million contracts, the most since Sept. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
