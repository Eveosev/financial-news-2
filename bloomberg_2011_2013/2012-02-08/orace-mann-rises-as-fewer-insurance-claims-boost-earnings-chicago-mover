Horace Mann Educators Corp. (HMN) , the
seller of insurance to public-school employees, jumped the most
in about 10 months as fourth-quarter profit increased on fewer
catastrophe costs.  Horace Mann  surged as much as 8.5 percent, the most  since 
April 27. It rose 6.6 percent to $17.20 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York.  Net income more than doubled in the three months ended Dec.
31 to $33.2 million, or 80 cents a share, from $15.2 million, or
36 cents, a year earlier, the Springfield, Illinois-based
company said yesterday in a statement. Catastrophe losses fell
46 percent to $3.1 million from $5.7 million.  “The property and casualty industry is in a period of
weakening profitability and slow growth,” Matthew Rohrmann, an
analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., said in a note to
investors yesterday. “We favor those companies that we believe
are best positioned to increase book value over time.” Rohrmann
has a “market perform”  rating  on the company and raised his
price target to $18 from $16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
