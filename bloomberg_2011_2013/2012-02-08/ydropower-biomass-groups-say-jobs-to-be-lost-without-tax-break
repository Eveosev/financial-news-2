Hydropower, biomass and geothermal
energy groups urged Congress to extend a tax credit that will
expire next year, joining the solar and wind industries in
saying jobs will be lost without renewable-energy subsidies.  The National Hydropower Association and the Geothermal
Energy Association, both based in Washington, and the Biomass
Power Association of Portland, Maine, in a letter today said the
“looming expiration” of the credit is already causing a
decline in construction.  “Failing to extend these tax incentives will effectively
bring these projects to a grinding halt and undermine the
progress our industries have made,” the groups, whose members
include  Ormat Technologies Inc. (ORA) , a Reno, Nevada-based unit of
 Ormat Industries Ltd. (ORMT)  in Yavne, Israel, and  Covanta Holding
Corp. (CVA)  in Morristown, New Jersey, wrote to congressional leaders.  Geothermal-energy projects, which use earth’s underground
heat to produce power, can take four to eight years to build,
according to the letter. Hydropower and biomass facilities also
take several years to construct.  Extending the credit, which is set to expire at the end of
next year, through 2016 will create jobs and increase the amount
of clean energy produced in the U.S., the groups said.  The  American Wind Energy Association  in Washington is
lobbying Congress to extend a tax credit that expires this year.
The Solar Energy Industries Association, also in  Washington ,
wants lawmakers to revive a Treasury Department grant program
that ended last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
