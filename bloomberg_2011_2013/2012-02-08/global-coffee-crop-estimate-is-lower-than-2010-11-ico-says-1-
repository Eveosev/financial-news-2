Global coffee production for 2011-12
will be 130.9 million bags, down from last month’s estimate of
132.4 million bags and 134.2 million bags a year earlier, the
 International Coffee Organization  said.  Consumption in calendar year 2011 is provisionally
estimated at 136.5 million bags compared with 135 million bags
in 2010, on increased demand from  emerging markets , the ICO said
in an e-mailed report today. “Particularly in India, the
proliferation of coffee bars is a sign of the dynamism of coffee
consumption,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
