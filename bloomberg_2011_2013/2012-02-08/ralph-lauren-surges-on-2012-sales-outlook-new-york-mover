Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL) , the retailer of
its namesake brand clothing, rose the most in more than three
years after saying revenue in the current fiscal year may gain
more than it previously expected.  Ralph Lauren   surged  9.2 percent to $171.49 at the close in
New York, for the biggest gain since Dec. 16, 2008. The shares
increased 24 percent last year.  Revenue for fiscal 2012 will jump 20 percent, up from a
previous projection of a high-teens to low 20 percent gain, the
New York-based company said today in a statement. Ralph Lauren
cited its “stronger-than-expected third-quarter performance”
in raising the forecast.  Net income in the third quarter rose 0.4 percent to $169
million, or $1.78 a share, from $168.4 million, or $1.72, a year
earlier, the company said. Analysts projected $1.68 a share, the
average of  estimates . Sales advanced 17 percent to $1.81
billion. Operating margin narrowed to 15 percent from 15.9
percent a year earlier.  “The operating margin resilience in the face of the full
brunt of cost inflation was impressive,” Adrianne Shapira, an
analyst with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in  New York , wrote in a
note to clients today. She rates the shares “neutral.”  Cost Inflation  Sales at its own stores jumped 22 percent, helped by the
contribution of new locations, Ralph Lauren said. Sales to
department stores increased 11 percent, boosted by strong demand
for men’s and children’s apparel.  Gross margin -- the percentage of sales left after
subtracting the cost of goods sold -- shrank to 57.1 percent
from 58.6 percent.  Ralph Lauren made some selective price increases to
compensate for higher costs to make products, Jackwyn Nemerov,
executive vice president, said on a conference call with
analysts today. Inflation pressures will ease, she predicted.  “We do expect to see some relief with fall shipments,”
Nemerov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
