Moody’s Corp. (MCO) , owner of the world’s
second-largest provider of credit ratings, dropped after its
fourth-quarter profit fell 30 percent as  Europe ’s sovereign-debt
crisis slowed bond sales around the world.  Moody’s fell 1.7 percent to $38.31 a share, after sliding
as much as 11.4 percent. The company’s net income dropped to
$96.2 million, or 43 cents a share, from $137.4 million, or 58
cents, a year earlier, New York-based Moody’s said today in a
statement. That was less than the average forecast of 49 cents
of five analysts in a Bloomberg  survey .  Companies from the U.S. to Europe to  Asia  postponed bond
sales in the fourth quarter as  Greece  and its creditors
struggled to reach an agreement to cut the country’s debt,
roiling markets. That meant fewer corporations, cities and
countries paid Moody’s Investors Service for ratings on new
offerings, which accounted for about 39 percent of the firm’s
 revenue  in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Issuance in the fourth quarter was quite weak,” Douglas Arthur, a New York-based analyst at Evercore Partners Inc., said
in a telephone interview before the results were announced.  Moody’s said revenue rose 0.5 percent to $567.1 million for
the quarter, from $564.3 million in the corresponding period of
2010. The firm’s analytics unit, which sells software and
consulting services, accounted for $200.2 million of that total,
up from $181.6 million a year earlier.  Buffett’s Stake  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is Moody’s biggest
shareholder, with a 13 percent stake, worth about $1.1 billion,
Bloomberg data show.  Corporate bond issuance worldwide fell 10 percent to $660.5
billion in the last three months of 2011 from $735.5 billion in
the same period of 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales picked up to $338.5 billion in January, almost
double December’s total.  “What we’re seeing, and this is very recent, is an
improvement in market tone,” Ray McDaniel, Moody’s chief
executive officer, said today on a conference call with
analysts. “The pipelines could be characterized as steady, but
probably not more than steady.”  Revenue at  Standard & Poor’s , the largest credit-ratings
company, fell 8 percent to $434 million in the fourth quarter,
the New York-based unit of McGraw-Hill Cos. announced last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
