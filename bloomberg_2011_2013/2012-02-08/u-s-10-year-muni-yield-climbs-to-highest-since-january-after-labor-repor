U.S. tax-exempt yields rose a fourth
straight day following last week’s stronger-than-forecast U.S.
labor report, pushing 10-year  interest rates  to the highest this
month.  Yields on top-rated municipal debt due in 10 years climbed
about 5 basis points to  1.82 percent  at 1 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield is the
highest since Jan. 30. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
Bond yields move inversely to prices.  The $3.7 trillion municipal market is seeing some “follow-
through” from declines in U.S. Treasuries, said Jason Hannon, a
trader at New-York based Arbor Research & Trading Inc., in a
telephone interview.  The yield on benchmark U.S. Treasuries due in 10 years
reached  2 percent  today, the highest since Jan. 25, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. employers added 243,000 jobs in January and the
 unemployment rate  fell to an almost three-year low of 8.3
percent, the Labor Department said on Feb. 3. The median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a gain
of 140,000 jobs.  Interest rates on 10-year municipal securities rated AAA
fell to  1.74 percent  on Feb. 2, the lowest level since Bloomberg
BVAL data began in January 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
