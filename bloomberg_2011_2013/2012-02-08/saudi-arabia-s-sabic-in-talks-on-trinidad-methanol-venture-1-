Saudi Basic Industries Corp. , the
world’s largest petrochemicals producer, is in talks over a
potential methanol plant venture in  Trinidad and Tobago ,
according to Chief Financial Officer Mutlaq al-Morished.  Talks are being conducted under a confidentiality
agreement, al-Morished said today at a conference in Dubai,
without giving any further details.  The majority government-owned company known as Sabic, which
produces methanol in  Saudi Arabia , is expanding to meet rising
demand for petrochemical products in growing economies including
China and India.  Trinidad and Tobago produces liquefied natural gas for sale
to the U.S. and uses gas for the production of methanol, ammonia
and steel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
