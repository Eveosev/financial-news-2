Mapfre  SA,  Spain ’s biggest insurer,
said 2011 profit rose 3.2 percent as growth at its Americas
business helped offset a drop in earnings at home.  Net income climbed to 963 million euros ($1.28 billion)
from 933.5 million euros a year earlier, the Madrid-based
company said in a filing to regulators today. That missed the
968.4 million-euro average  estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of
four analysts.  Mapfre has  diversified  its business outside of Spain over
the past decade and 60 percent of revenue and 45 percent of
profit now come from outside its home market. Pretax profit from
its Spanish direct-insurance division fell 3 percent in 2011
compared with a 77 percent jump in its Americas division, the
company said.  “The situation of Mapfre in terms of profit and revenue
would be very different if we didn’t have 60 percent of our
revenue from abroad,” Chairman Jose Manuel Martinez said in a
press conference in  Madrid .  Premiums from Mapfre’s Spanish direct-insurance business,
which includes coverage for families and companies, rose 6.1
percent, led by an 18 percent jump in life premiums.  Group  revenue  rose 15 percent to 23.5 billion euros in 2011
and premiums climbed 16 percent to 19.6 billion euros, the
insurer said. The combined ratio in its non-life business
reached 96.9 percent, up 1.1 percentage points from the previous
year. A ratio above 100 percent means claims and costs exceed
premium income, making underwriting unprofitable.  Mapfre said it would propose paying investors a
complementary dividend of 8 euro cents a share, bringing total
shareholder remuneration in 2011 to 456.5 million euros, a 2.7
percent increase from the previous year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
