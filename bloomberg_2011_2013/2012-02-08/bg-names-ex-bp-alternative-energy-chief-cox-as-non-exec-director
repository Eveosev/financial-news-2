BG Group Plc , the U.K.’s third-
largest natural gas producer, named Vivienne Cox, the former
chief of  BP Plc ’s  alternative energy  division, as a non-
 executive director .  Cox will join BG immediately, the Reading, England-based
company said today in a statement. She also serves as a director
on  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO) ’s board.  Cox, who worked for BP from 1981 to 2009, oversaw about $3
billion in renewable-energy investment since  Alternative Energy 
was set up in November 2005 until she left the  oil company .
London-based BP has since decided to exit its solar power
business after 40 years.  Under Cox’s management, BP decided to scale back wind-
energy ventures, focusing on land-based projects in the U.S. and
ending most of its projects in India, China and Turkey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
