Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco
President  John Williams  said he considers the option of new Fed
purchases of mortgage bonds a “close call.”  The central bank also has limited “headroom” for buying
more Treasuries under any new quantitative easing program,
Williams said to reporters after a speech today in San Ramon,
 California .  There’s “only so much headroom to do further Treasuries”
beyond the short term, Williams said. He said that he’s in a
“close-call space” in seeking a third round of quantitative
easing, which will depend on “risks to the forecasts.”  “Right now, my baseline forecast” for the economy “is
not a satisfactory forecast,” he said. “Just based on the
forecast, you’d want to boost the economy.” Still, it’s not a
slam dunk” and “you’d want to weigh the costs and benefits,”
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
