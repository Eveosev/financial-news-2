(Corrects to say Simandou output will start in first half
of the year in third paragraph.)  Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-ore
producer, plans to invest $21 billion in 2012, 60 percent of
which will be in Brazil, Global Strategic Procurement director
Paulo Couto said.  Africa will be “a leading part” of the company’s
investment outside of Brazil, Couto said at the Investing in
African Mining Indaba conference in  Cape Town  today.  Output from Simandou, the iron-ore deposit in Guinea where
the company has invested $1.26 billion, will start in the first
half of this year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
