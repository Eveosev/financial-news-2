Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Gedeon Richter Nyrt.  (RICHT HB) jumped as much as 2.6

clinical trial indicated that patients treated with the
antipsychotic agent Cariprazine for acute manic episodes
experienced “significant improvement.”  OTP Bank Nyrt.  (OTP HB), Hungary’s largest lender, advanced
1.1 percent to 4,135 forint as  Greece ’s political leaders worked
