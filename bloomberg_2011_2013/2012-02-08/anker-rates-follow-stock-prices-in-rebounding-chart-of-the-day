Shares of commodity-tanker owners may
have foreshadowed this week’s rebound in shipping costs from a
quarter-century low.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, a Bloomberg index of dry-
bulk shipping stocks started rebounding from a record low seven
weeks before the Baltic Dry Index did the same. The chart tracks
the two indicators since 2008, when calculations of the stock
gauge begin.  Bloomberg’s global index of 14 shippers reached a record
low on Dec. 19, when the Baltic Dry Index recorded the sixth of
33 straight losses. The gauge of shipping rates sank 66 percent
during the streak to 647, the lowest reading since August 1986.  Lower transportation costs reflect an excess of tankers
available to carry  iron ore  and other commodities rather than a
decline in the amount of cargo, Polys Hajioannou, chairman and
chief executive officer of Safe Bulkers Inc., said yesterday
during a Bloomberg Radio interview.  “Demand is improving, but supply does not allow the
freight market to do what it usually does,” Hajioannou said. He
estimated that commodity shipments are climbing by 7 percent to
8 percent annually, and added that he expects tanker rates to
move higher from next year onward.  Shares of Safe Bulkers, based in  Athens , rose 18 percent
through yesterday from their price when the Bloomberg index set
its low. The stock gauge advanced even more, 24 percent, during
the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
