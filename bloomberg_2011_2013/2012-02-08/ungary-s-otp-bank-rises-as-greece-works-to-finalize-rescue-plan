OTP Bank Nyrt. ,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, advanced as Greece’s political leaders worked on a
rescue plan with creditors, boosting demand for riskier
emerging-market assets.  The shares climbed 1.1 percent to 4,135 forint by the close
in Budapest, extending gains this year to 29 percent.  Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos is meeting with the
nation’s political leaders to negotiate terms required for a 130
billion-euro ($172 billion) rescue package. Late last night, he
held an unscheduled meeting with the so-called troika,
comprising the European Commission, the  European Central Bank 
and the International Monetary Fund, to put the final touches on
terms required for the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
