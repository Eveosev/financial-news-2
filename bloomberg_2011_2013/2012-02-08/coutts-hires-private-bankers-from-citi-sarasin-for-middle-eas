Coutts International, a wealth-
management business owned by Royal Bank of Scotland Plc, hired
three private bankers to serve  Middle East  clients and is
seeking more staff for the region.  Akram Khattab joins the firm from Bank Sarasin & Cie. AG’s
Alpen unit and Ali-Reza Vahabzadeh from Citigroup Inc.’s wealth
unit, the company said today in an e-mailed statement. Both will
be based in Geneva. Coutts also appointed Arjun Mittal from
Sarasin as Dubai-based head of non-resident Indian customers.  “The Middle East is one of our core markets for growth,”
Alex Classen, Zurich-based chief executive officer of Coutts
International, said in the statement.  Coutts International, which employs 25 staff in its offices
in the  United Arab Emirates , plans to recruit another 20 people
to serve Middle East clients this year. The RBS-owned business
managed 41.8 billion Swiss francs ($45.8 billion) for clients
worldwide at the end of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
