Australia’s dollar is overvalued and
may be attractive should it weaken more than 2.5 percent to
$1.05, according to Adrian Lee, chief investment officer at
currency portfolio manager Adrian Lee & Partners.  The currency touched a six-month high yesterday versus the
 U.S. dollar  after the nation’s  Reserve Bank  unexpectedly left
 interest rates  unchanged at 4.25 percent on Feb. 7 and signaled
optimism that global growth will strengthen. The currency has
gained 9.9 percent over the past six months against its major
counterparts, the best performer among 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  “Technically the Australian dollar is strong now, but
quite overvalued,” London-based Lee, whose  fund  manages more
than $8.5 billion, said in an interview yesterday. “We wouldn’t
be buying it at $1.08.”  The Aussie climbed as high as $1.0845 yesterday, the most
since Aug. 2. It fetched $1.0801 as of 9:12 a.m. in Sydney.  RBA Governor Glenn Stevens cited “quite robust” Chinese
growth and a “moderate expansion” in the U.S. as reasons for
holding rates this month, even after  Australia ’s 2011 jobs
market was the weakest in 19 years.  Manufacturing in  China , Australia’s largest trading
partner, expanded for a second month in January while U.S.
unemployment slid to a three-year low, government reports last
week showed. Commodities account for more than half of
Australia’s exports.  “There is big demand for commodities and emerging-market
growth should continue,” Lee said, saying he expected the so-
called Aussie to stay strong. “$1.05 is a level we may buy at
again.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
