Naftna Industrija Srbije AD , Serbia’s
biggest oil company controlled by  OAO Gazprom Neft , will have
its Pancevo refinery ready for the production of Euro-5 grade
fuels by October.  The overhaul of the facility will be completed in August
and production will start after two months of testing, with
capacity seen reaching 4 million tons a year in 2013, NIS’s
Chief Executive Officer Kirill Kravchenko.  “The upgrades will cost an expected 397 million euros
($526 million),” Kravchenko told reporters in Belgrade. The
upgrades will cut  carbon emissions  and include hydro-cracking
and hydro-processing facilities, he said.  Gazprom Neft bought Serbian refineries in Pancevo and Novi
Sad when it acquired a majority stake in NIS in 2009. It pledged
then to invest at least 500 million euros to improve the quality
of fuels processed at Pancevo, while using the other refinery to
produce base oils and lubricants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
