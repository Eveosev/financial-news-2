Bourbon SA , owner of the biggest
fleet of supply and crew ships for the oil industry, reported
fourth-quarter revenue rose 23 percent as more vessels were
rented at higher prices.  Sales in the last three months of 2011 rose to 273.1
million euros ($362.1 million) from 221.3 million euros a year
earlier, the Paris-based company said in a statement. Bourbon
commissioned 39 new vessels during the period.  Daily rates for vessels “start to improve with the
market,” Chief Executive Officer Christian Lefevre said on a
conference call with journalists. “We are confident this will
continue this year.”  Bourbon bolstered its vessel-building program last year in
anticipation that explorers will choose more modern vessels.
Under a $2 billion expansion plan, Bourbon plans to own 600
ships by 2015, up from 437.  The fleet’s average utilization rate reached 85.7 percent
in the fourth quarter, an improvement of 4.6 percentage points
from the year-earlier period, according to the statement.  “Increased demand for offshore service vessels should
continue in the coming years,” Bourbon said. The “sharp market
upturn” stems from more spending by  oil companies , increased
drilling and contractors’ strong order books.  Daily rates could still rise by 10 percent to 30 percent
depending on the market segments over the next two or three
years, Lefevre said. Prices are well under highs reached in 2007
and 2008, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
