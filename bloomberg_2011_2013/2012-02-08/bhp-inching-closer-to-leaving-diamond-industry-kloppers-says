BHP Billiton Ltd. , the world’s
largest mining company, may leave the diamond industry for at
least 20 years as it focuses on larger projects, according to
Chief Executive Officer  Marius Kloppers .  “Once you decide to exit a specific sector you’re probably
not going to enter that for a couple of decades,” Kloppers said
today on a conference call. “We’ve made that choice in titanium
and we’re inching closer to that choice in diamonds.”  BHP announced Nov. 29 that it’s studying the sale of some
or all of its diamond unit, saying the operations may no longer
fit with its strategy. The Melbourne-based company, which
accounted for about 7.5 percent of global diamond production by
value in 2010, owns 80 percent of the  Ekati mine  in  Canada ’s
 Northwest Territories .  The Ekati deposit, valued at $300 million to $500 million
by Investec Securities Ltd., will probably be run until closure
if no buyer is found, Kloppers said.  “As we invest more in our bigger assets, the minimum
threshold for both an industry and an asset in terms of scale
gets moved up,” he said. “We then make choices on
industries.”  BHP agreed last week to sell its stake in Richards Bay
Minerals to Rio Tinto Group, exiting the titanium minerals
industry. The company is spending $80 billion in the next five
years to boost output of  iron ore , copper and coal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
