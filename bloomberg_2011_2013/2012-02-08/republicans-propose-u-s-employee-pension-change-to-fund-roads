House Republicans  are proposing that
U.S. government employees, including members of Congress, pay
more of their pension costs and apply the $44.6 billion savings
over 10 years to transportation projects.  Employees from all three branches of government would pay
about 1.5 percent more toward their pensions over three years,
according Ali Ahmad, a spokesman for the House Oversight and
Government Reform Committee. House Republicans added the changes
to their transportation bill, according to a measure on the
Rules Committee website.  House Republicans have proposed eliminating the use of
vehicle-fuel taxes for mass transit projects and dedicating that
money to highway and bridge repairs. They have proposed a one-
time transfer of $40 billion from the U.S. general fund to pay
for mass-transit projects during the next five years.  The pension changes would begin as soon as 2013, according
to the measure. The Rules Committee pulled together legislation
from various House committees to fund transportation projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
