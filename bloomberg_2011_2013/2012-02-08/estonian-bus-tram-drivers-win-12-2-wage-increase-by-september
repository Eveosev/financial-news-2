Estonian public transport drivers
will receive a 12.2 percent wage increase, to be phased in by
September, the Transport Workers’ Union said today in an e-
mailed statement.  Drivers’ base salaries will rise to 2.8 euros ($3.7) per
hour, effective Feb. 1, while  monthly wages  will increase to at
least 700 euros from September, according to an agreement which
is due to be signed today, the union said in the statement.  The Baltic country has the third-lowest level of trade
union membership in the European Union at 10 percent, behind
France and  Lithuania , according to the EU-financed  worker-
participation.eu  website. Public transport and medicine are the
only two industries in  Estonia  where there is a nationwide wage
agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
