The global corporate default rate
increased to 2 percent in January from 1.8 percent a month
earlier,  Moody’s (MCO)  Investors Service said in a report.  In the U.S., the rate of corporate failure rose to 2.2
percent from 1.8 percent in December. In  Europe , the number was
unchanged at 3 percent. The global rate could rise to 2.7
percent by January 2013, according to the report.  “Default rates remain low by historic standards, but they
are increasing, particularly in Europe,” Albert Metz, managing
director of credit policy research at Moody’s, said in the
report. “We expect more defaults in the coming months. But our
baseline case remains that default rates will remain below their
long-term average.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
