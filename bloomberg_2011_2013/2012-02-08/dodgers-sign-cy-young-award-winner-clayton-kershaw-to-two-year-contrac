Clayton Kershaw, winner of the 2011
Cy Young Award as the National League’s best pitcher, avoided
salary arbitration by signing a two-year deal with the  Los
Angeles Dodgers .  Left-handed Kershaw, 23, the youngest pitcher to take the
NL honor since 20-year-old Dwight Gooden of the  New York Mets  in
1985, led the league with a 2.28 earned run average and 248
strikeouts and tied for the lead with 21 wins last season.  He was the seventh pitcher to lead the league in all three
categories since the Cy Young Award debuted in 1956.  “I’m excited and happy, and just glad it’s over with,”
Kershaw said yesterday. “I don’t have to worry about it next
year. Now that it’s over, I can just play ball.”  Kershaw received a $19 million contract, MLB.com said. He
had sought a $10 million annual salary in arbitration after
earning $500,000 last year, the report said.  Kershaw’s ERA in 2011 was the lowest for any starting
pitcher in  Major League Baseball  and the best for an NL Cy Young
Award winner since 1997, when Pedro Martinez had a 1.90 ERA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
