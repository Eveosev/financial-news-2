Ceres Inc. (CERE) , a producer of seeds for
crops used to make biofuels, plans to seek as much as $85
million in an  initial public offering  after cutting its asking
price by about 26 percent.  The  Thousand Oaks , California-based company is attempting
to sell 5 million shares at $16 to $17 apiece after previously
offering them for $21 to $23, it said in a  regulatory filing .
The shares, scheduled to price today, will start trading
tomorrow on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol CERE.  Ceres is attempting its IPO after Renewable Energy Group
Inc., the biggest U.S. biodiesel producer, reduced its offering
last month. It also follows offerings by biofuel producers such
as  Gevo Inc. (GEVO)  and Kior Inc., which have lost money for buyers
since going public last year.  The top end of the reduced range would give Ceres a market
value of $395.2 million, based on total expected outstanding
shares of 23.2 million after the offering. The company, led by
Chief Executive Officer Richard Hamilton, has posted net losses
since at least 2007, according to the filing. Revenue in the
three months ended Nov. 30 rose 1.9 percent to $1.75 million
from a year earlier.  Ceres, which has been operating since 1997, will use the
share-sale proceeds to develop and commercialize crop seeds. The
company is ramping up production to challenge  Monsanto Co. (MON)  and
DuPont Co., the two largest U.S. makers of genetically modified
seeds, which it names as competitors in its filing.  Renewable Energy Group raised $72 million in its IPO last
month. The shares slid 6.8 percent through yesterday. Amyris
Inc., the maker of specialty chemicals and  diesel fuel , sank 40
percent through yesterday following its 2010 public debut.  All of the shares in the offering are being sold by Ceres.
Monsanto will have a 4.8 percent stake in the company after the
sale, which is being led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Barclays Plc., the company said in the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
