Turkish  industrial production  rose
2.7 percent in December from a month earlier, erasing a decline
in November and pushing the annual figure above expectations.  Output rose 3.7 percent annually, according to  unadjusted
figures  on the website of the state statistics institute in
Ankara today. That compared with a median forecast of 2.8
percent in a Bloomberg survey of eight economists.  The central bank began tightening monetary policy in
October and intensified the squeeze in late December as a slump
in the value of the lira helped drive  inflation  to nearly double
the 5.5 percent goal. Output grew an average of 8.9 percent last
year, compared with 13.1 percent in 2010, when gross domestic
product expanded 9 percent.  “Despite sour global developments, the Turkish economy
shows significant resilience,”  Ozgur Altug , chief economist for
BGC Partners in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed report. The
figures suggest that full-year growth last year may be “around
8.5 percent, compared to our current forecast of 8.1 percent.”  Adjusted for the number of working days,  annual output 
growth slowed to 3.8 percent, the lowest reading in the year,
from 5.3 percent in November.  The slowdown “suggests the policy is gradually achieving
its goal,”  Tevfik Aksoy , chief economist for the region at
 Morgan Stanley & Co ., said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
