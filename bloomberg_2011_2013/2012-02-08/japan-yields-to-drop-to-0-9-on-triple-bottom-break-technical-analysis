Yields (GJGC10)  on  Japan ’s 10-year government
bonds may reach the lowest level since October 2010, should they
break below support at about 0.94 percent, Barclays Capital
Japan Ltd. said, citing trading patterns.  Ten-year yields declined to 0.94 percent on Nov. 17 and 18,
0.935 percent on Jan. 16, and 0.94 percent on Feb. 3, forming
“triple bottoms,” according to Reiko Tokukatsu, a senior
fixed-income strategist at Barclays in  Tokyo . Yields are poised
to test the support line connecting the three bottoms, she said.  “Yields may try to breach 0.94 percent once again after
bouncing back three times,” Tokukatsu said.  The rate increased 1 1/2 basis points or 0.015 percentage
point, to 0.985 percent as of 2:29 p.m. today in Tokyo.  Should the support be breached, the rates may extend the
slide to about 0.90 percent, the lowest since October 2010,
Tokukatsu said. Support refers to an area where analysts
anticipate orders may be be clustered.  The ichimoku chart, which analyzes the midpoints of
historic highs and lows, also shows a downward trend for 10-year
yields, with the conversion line remaining below the baseline.
The baseline plots the sum of the highest high and lowest low
over the last 26 trading days. The conversion line is the same
calculation over the last nine trading days.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
