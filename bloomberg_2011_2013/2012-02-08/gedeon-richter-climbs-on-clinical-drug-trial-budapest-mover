Gedeon Richter Nyrt. ,  Hungary ’s
biggest drugmaker, rose after a clinical trial for one of its
products showed patients improved.  The shares jumped as much as 2.6 percent and traded 1
percent higher at 38,995 forint by the close in Budapest,
extending its gains this year to 14 percent. The benchmark BUX
stock index advanced 0.4 percent to 19,724.34 today.  Richter and its partner Forest Laboratories Inc. said a
Phase III clinical trial indicated that patients treated with
the antipsychotic agent Cariprazine for acute manic episodes
experienced “significant improvement,” according to a
statement posted on the Budapest stock exchange website.  “The news is certainly favorable,” Levente Blaho and Adam
Keszeg, Budapest-based analysts at Raiffeisen Bank International
AG, wrote in a research report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
