Oman, whose banking industry more
than doubled in five years, is close to finishing a draft
rulebook for Islamic banking in the Gulf Arab country, said
central bank governor Hamud al-Zadjali.  “We are preparing a rulebook for Islamic banking, and the
first draft is almost complete,” al-Zadjali said in a phone
interview today. The central bank met with local lenders on Jan.
25 to discuss the regulations, he said.  The guidelines won’t be completed before the banking law is
amended by mid-year to incorporate lenders that comply with the
religion’s ban on interest, al-Zadjali said. Oman approved the
creation of two Islamic banks last year, Al Izz International
Bank in October and Bank Nizwa in May.  Shariah-compliant banking will allow lenders in the
country, home to almost three million people, the chance to tap
growth in the global Islamic finance industry. Shariah financing
is expanding as much as 16 percent a year and the industry may
be valued at $1.5 trillion by the end of 2012, Raj Mohamed,
managing director at Singapore-based consulting firm Five
Pillars Pte, said Jan. 18.  Islamic banking assets may account for a 10th of Oman’s
industry total within 12 months of starting services, Hilal Al
Barwani, vice president of banking supervision at the central
bank said Jan. 18. Oman’s banking assets jumped to 17.9 billion
rials ($46.6 billion) in November from 7.02 billion rials the
same month in 2006, according to  central bank data .  To contact the reporter on this story:
