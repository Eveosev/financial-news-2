Swiss unemployment was unchanged in
January amid signs that faltering export demand and the franc’s
gain may curtail the Swiss economy in the coming months.  The jobless rate, adjusted for seasonal swings, was at 3.1
percent, unchanged from December and in line with the median
forecast of 13 economists in a  Bloomberg News survey , the State
Secretariat for Economic Affairs in Bern said in an e-mailed
statement today. The December reading was the highest in eight
months.  The  unadjusted jobless rate  increased to 3.4 percent in
January from 3.3 percent, today’s report showed. The number of
open jobs rose 2,437 to 17,471 last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
