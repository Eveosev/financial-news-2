Hog prices fell for the second time
this week on signs of increasing U.S. supplies of pork. Cattle
futures gained.  Slaughtered hogs in  Iowa  and southern  Minnesota , the
biggest U.S. pork-producing area, averaged 275 pounds (125
kilograms) in the week ending Feb. 4, up 1.6 pounds from a year
earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. The
“relatively mild winter” this year may have boosted weights,
said Dick Quiter, a broker at McFarland Commodities LLC. Animals
use more energy in colder conditions, slowing weight gain.  “There are plenty of hogs around,” Quiter said in a
telephone interview from Chicago. “Packers aren’t having to
reach with any type of higher bids to get all the hogs they
want.”  Hog futures for April settlement fell 0.2 percent to close
at 88.95 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile
Exchange. The price has gained 5.5 percent this year.  Cattle futures for April delivery rose 0.2 percent to
settle at $1.288 a pound in Chicago. The commodity has gained
6.1 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement rose 0.2 percent
to $1.55275 a pound.  Meatpackers processed an estimated 592,000  cattle  last
week, down 2.6 percent from a week earlier, USDA data show. At
midday, wholesale  beef  climbed 0.4 percent to $1.8647 a pound,
the highest since Jan. 12.  Processors “really slashed the slaughter rates,” Adam Stout, a risk-management consultant at FCStone Group Inc. in
 Kansas City ,  Missouri , said in a telephone interview. “That may
be finally catching up with us,” resulting in higher beef
prices, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
