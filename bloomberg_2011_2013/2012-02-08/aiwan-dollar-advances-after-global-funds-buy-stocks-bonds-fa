Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened for a
second day after global funds boosted holdings of local stocks
on optimism the island’s economic recovery will withstand
 Europe ’s debt crisis.  Government bonds  fell.  International investors bought $386 million more Taiwanese
shares than they sold today, taking net purchases for the week
to $728 million, exchange data show. The economy will grow 3.91
percent in 2012, the statistics bureau said last week. Gross
domestic product rose 4 percent last year, according to official
preliminary estimates.  “Money is coming into Taiwan’s stocks as people are
getting optimistic about the global economy,” said  Albert Lee ,
a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at Cathay United Bank Co.  The  Taiwan dollar  strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$29.530
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency touched NT$29.415 on Feb. 4, the strongest level in
almost five months. It has advanced 2.6 percent this year.  The yield on the government’s 1 percent notes due January
2017 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.943
percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market show.  “There was money coming into Taiwan bonds to profit from
the rapid currency rally,” Lee said. “But the room for the
yields to go much lower is limited” after the rate reached the
lowest level since November 2010 on Jan. 30, he said.  The yield on benchmark  30-year  securities fell five basis
points to 1.82 percent after the Ministry of Finance sold notes
of that maturity at a lower-than-expected rate. The NT$35
billion ($1.2 billion) of notes yielded 1.823 percent, lower
than the 1.865 percent traders predicted in a Bloomberg survey.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.395 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
