Crude oil options fell for the first
time in three days as oil futures were little changed after the
U.S. Energy Department reported that inventories climbed as fuel
consumption dropped to the lowest level in almost 13 years.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 28.3 as of 1:30 p.m. in New York, down
from 30.2 yesterday. It was the first decline in three days.  Crude for February delivery rose 14 cents to $98.55 a
barrel at 1:25 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures
slipped from an intraday high of $100.09 after the department
said crude supplies rose 304,000 barrels to 339.2 million last
week.  “We’re still in this trading range between $96 and $102
and we’ve been there for a few months now,” Fred Rigolini, vice
president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York, said by phone.
“As we remain in this trading range, I’m looking for volatility
to stay relatively low.”  The most active options in electronic trading today were
April $130 calls, which were unchanged at 18 cents a barrel at
1:50 p.m. with 1,787 lots trading. Next were March $95 puts,
which slipped 5 cents to 54 cents on 1,632 lots, and April $120
calls, which fell 2 cents to 29 cents on 1,313 lots. A contract
covers 1,000 barrels of crude. Puts were 49 percent of volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  Yesterday, puts accounted for 49.6 percent of the volume.
May $120 calls were the most actively traded options, with 7,775
lots changing hands. They added 16 cents to 70 cents a barrel.
The next-most active options, March $95 puts, fell 32 cents to
59 cents a barrel on volume of 6,966 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 41,871
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 37,258 lots and
