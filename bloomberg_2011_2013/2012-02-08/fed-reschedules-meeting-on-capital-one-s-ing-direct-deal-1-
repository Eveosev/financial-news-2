The  Federal Reserve ’s Board of
Governors said it rescheduled a meeting to discuss  Capital One
Financial Corp. (COF) ’s proposed acquisition of ING Direct USA, moving
it to Feb. 13 from today.  “We understand that the delay is due to a scheduling
conflict, and we look forward to their decision early next
week,”  Tatiana Stead , a spokeswoman for the McLean, Virginia-
based lender, said in an e-mailed statement.  Richard Fairbank, Capital One’s chief executive officer,
said in a presentation that the deal remains on track to close
in the first quarter. The acquisition would be finalized a “few
days” after Fed approval, Fairbank said today at a conference
in Miami sponsored by Credit Suisse Group AG.  “ING is a very low-cost way for Capital One to become a
national player” in retail banking, Fairbank said. The purchase
is “a bit of a game changer,” he said.  Housing and consumer-rights advocates including the
National Community Reinvestment Coalition have opposed the ING
deal, saying it will create another “too-big-to-fail”
institution. Public opposition led the Fed to hold three
hearings to review the deal.  Advocates hope the delay is an indication the central bank
“is taking additional time to ensure the public understands how
this deal will impact them,”  John Taylor , president & CEO of
NCRC, said in an e-mailed statement. “This delay is yet the
latest sign of the seriousness with which the Federal Reserve is
observing its duties to protect the American taxpayer.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
