Akbank TAS , a Turkish bank part-owned
by Citigroup Inc., is offering lenders higher interest and fees
to refinance $1.3 billion of debt maturing in March.  Akbank may pay an all-in margin of 145 basis points more
than benchmark rates on the new one-year loan coordinated by
Bank of America Corp., according to a person with knowledge of
the transaction who declined to be identified because the terms
are private. That compares with an all-in margin of 110 basis
points on the Istanbul-based bank’s one-year facility being
replaced, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Akbank is  Turkey ’s second-largest listed bank by market
value. Citigroup bought a 20 percent stake in Akbank in 2007 for
about $3.1 billion.  A spokesman for Akbank in Istanbul who declined to be
identified wouldn’t comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
