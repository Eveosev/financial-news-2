Mexichem SAB (MEXCHEM*) , the Latin American
chemical producer that has bought more than 15 companies since
2007, agreed to acquire  Wavin NV (WAVIN)  in a deal valuing the company
at 531 million euros ($704 million) to expand its plastic pipes
business in  Europe .  Mexichem intends to make a cash offer of 10.50 euros a
share, the Tlalnepantla, Mexico-based company said today in a
statement. That’s more than double Wavin’s closing price on Nov.
21, the day before Mexichem announced an initial offer.  Mexichem raised its offer three times before Zwolle,
Netherlands-based Wavin agreed to be bought. Mexichem previously
acquired AlphaGary, a thermoplastic-compounds operation, Policyd
SA and plastic tube maker Plasticos Rex SA.  “Together we will be exceptionally positioned to
capitalize on growth opportunities,” President Ricardo
Gutierrez Munoz of Mexichem’s executive committee said in the
statement.  Wavin  rose  8.5 percent to close at 10.355 euros in
Amsterdam. The shares have gained 162 percent since Nov. 21.
Mexichem increased 0.3 percent to 46.77 pesos in Mexico City.  Delta Lloyd NV (DL) , which owns about 8 percent of Wavin, would
have immediately agreed to tender its stake if Mexichem’s offer
was 11 euros a share, Jack Jonk, head of equities at the
company’s asset management unit, said in a telephone interview.
The company, based in Amsterdam, is still in talks with Mexichem
about the proposed bid, Jonk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
