The following companies had unusual

index rose 0.5 percent to 2,572.78.  Cencosud SA (CENCOSUD)  (CENCOSUD CC) climbed the most in two months,
gaining 3.7 percent to 3,038.50 pesos.  Chile ’s biggest retailer
is talking with investment banks about a possible sale of
American depositary receipts as part of a capital increase
approved by shareholders in April, Cencosud said in a regulatory
filing.  Empresas CMPC SA (CMPC)  (CMPC CC) advanced 2.3 percent to 2,103
pesos. Chile’s second-biggest pulp exporter rose along with
other natural resource companies after Greek politicians reached
a deal on austerity measures needed to qualify for international
rescue funds, boosting prospects for global growth and commodity
demand.  Multiexport Foods SA (MULTIFOO)  (MULTIFOO CC), a Chilean salmon
farmer, fell 2.4 percent to 132.8 pesos. UBS AG analysts
recommended selling Marine Harvest ASA, the world’s biggest
salmon farmer, saying the risks to fish prices are on the
downside.  Sigdo Koppers SA (SK)   gained for a record ninth straight
day, rising 1 percent to 1,060 pesos. The owner of companies
that make explosives and provide services to the  mining industry 
has rallied 14 percent since Jan. 20 when it completed a 224
billion-peso ($471 million) rights offering as the company seeks
to tap an estimated $67 billion in planned mining investments in
Chile this decade. The capital increase is encouraging more
brokerages to cover the stock, raising the company’s profile
among investors, said Rodolfo Tapia, an analyst at Banco Penta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
