The Canadian dollar slipped versus
its U.S. counterpart as global investors awaited a decision on
whether  Greece ’s political leaders will agree to conditions
required for a second international rescue package.  The currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, trimmed losses as a draft of a new
financing deal for Greece outlined permanent spending cuts the
nation faces. The loonie touched its weakest level versus
Australia’s dollar since 1997.  Canada ’s currency has traded this
week within a one-cent range against the greenback.  “Given the tight range we have seen in the Canadian
dollar, this move felt pretty big,” said  Steve Butler , director
of foreign-exchange trading in Toronto at Bank of  Nova Scotia ’s
Scotia Capital unit. “The market is still concerned about
Greece. Unless they come up with some positive headlines, I
would expect a little risk-off.”  Canada’s dollar depreciated 0.2 percent to 99.60 cents per
 U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. Toronto time, after losing as much as 0.5
percent and gaining 0.1 percent earlier. It has traded this week
between 99.29 cents and 99.95 cents, following an advance on
Feb. 3 to 99.28 cents, its strongest level since Oct. 31. One
Canadian dollar buys $1.0040.  Crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, pared earlier gains.
Futures for March were up 0.3 percent to $99.04 a barrel in New
York after climbing earlier as much as 1.4 percent and falling
0.6 percent.  Bonds Drop  Canada’s government bonds fell for a second day, pushing
benchmark  two-year  yields up four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.08 percent, the highest level since Oct.
31. Yields on the  10-year  note rose three basis points to 2.07
percent, the highest since Jan. 25.  The government auctioned C$3.5 billion ($3.5 billion) of
two-year debt today at an average yield of 1.095 percent, up
from 0.973 percent at the January offering of the securities and
above the 0.986 percent average of the past five offerings. The
0.75 percent notes are due in May 2014.  The auction attracted $8.2 billion in bids, 2.34 times the
amount offered. The  coverage ratio , a gauge of demand, fell from
2.59 in January and compared with an average of 2.51 at the past
five sales.  The loonie weakened to its low of the day as Greek Prime
Minister  Lucas Papademos  was locked in talks with leaders of the
political parties that support his caretaker government. He met
late yesterday with officials of the European Commission, the
 European Central Bank  and the  International Monetary Fund  to put
final touches on the rescue plan.  Permanent Cuts  Greece would pledge permanent spending cuts, including
lower pension payments and a 20 percent cut in the minimum wage,
under the draft of a new financing deal with the EU and IMF
obtained by Bloomberg News. The draft is the focus of
Papademos’s talks with political leaders to secure a 130
billion-euro rescue plan.  Euro-area finance ministers are due to gather tomorrow for
an emergency meeting in Brussels. Luxembourg Prime Minister
 Jean-Claude Juncker , who chairs the group of finance chiefs from
the 17-nation euro area, called the session, according to an e-
mailed statement today. It will follow the ECB’s monthly policy
meeting and an assembly of Greek creditors in Paris.  The Canadian currency weakened against the euro for a third
day, depreciating 0.2 percent to C$1.3208.  Commodity Currencies  Australia ’s dollar touched C$1.0784, its highest level
against the loonie since May 1997, as commodities rose earlier
on optimism an agreement on Greece would be reached. Australia,
like Canada, is a commodity exporter. The Aussie traded later at
C$1.0755, up less than 0.1 percent from yesterday.  “It’s highlighting that Canada in a risk-on environment
seems to underperform, and in a risk-off over performs, against
its commodity brethren,” Butler said.  The Canadian dollar gained 2 percent over the past three
months against nine developed-nation counterparts monitored by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The U.S. dollar fell 1.2
percent, while the euro dropped 3.5 percent. The Aussie dollar
climbed 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
