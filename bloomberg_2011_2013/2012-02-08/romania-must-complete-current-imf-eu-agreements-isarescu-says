Romania  must complete its current
agreements with the  International Monetary Fund  and the European
Union and sell more debt on international markets, central bank
Governor Mugur Isarescu said.  The country needs to start funding itself from the markets
as a new accord after the current precautionary one expires next
year would send a wrong signal, Isarescu said today in a speech
in Bucharest.  “Romania needs to complete the current agreement because
it will mean that things are going well and we no longer need a
teacher, more or less demanding,” Isarescu said. “The
country’s return to the market after two agreements with the IMF
is not an option but is a must.”  The Balkan nation relied on a 20 billion-euro ($27 billion)
loan from the IMF and the EU from 2009 to 2011 to help it emerge
from the deepest recession on record. The government secured
another 5 billion-euro precautionary accord with the lenders to
reassure investors it will keep fiscal discipline ahead of local
and general elections this year. It doesn’t plan to draw on the
money set aside.  The ruling coalition pledged to lower the  budget deficit  to
1.9 percent of gross domestic product this year from 4.4 percent
in 2011 to avoid possible financing issues stemming from market
turmoil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
