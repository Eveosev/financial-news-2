Brazil is among the “world’s most
exciting markets,” according to  Mark Mobius , executive chairman
of Franklin Templeton Investment’s Emerging Markets Group.  Mobius made the comments in a post on Templeton’s  website 
following a recent trip to  Sao Paulo  to look for new investments
and to visit companies that his firm had invested in. The  fund
manager  visited banks, one of the nation’s car rental firms, a
beer and soft-drink producer and a software company, he wrote,
without naming the businesses.  “We continue to keep our long-term eye on Brazil, one of
the world’s most exciting markets,” Mobius wrote in his website
post, which was dated yesterday. The nation is among the most
“economically vibrant” in the Western hemisphere, he wrote.  Brazil ’s government is cutting interest rates, taxes and
loosening lending requirements to boost growth and offset the
effects of Europe’s debt crisis. The nation’s  industrial
production  rose in December at the fastest pace in seven months,
as a weaker currency and lower borrowing costs help domestic
manufacturers in Latin America’s biggest economy, according to
government data on Jan. 31.  The Bovespa Index, Brazil’s benchmark stock gauge, surged
16 percent this year after slumping 18 percent in 2011. The
 measure  trades at 10.5 times estimated profit, compared with its
four-year average of 11.7 times. The MSCI BRIC Index, which
tracks Brazil, Russia, India and China, trades for 9.2 times.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
