The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development approved 2.5 million euros ($3.3 million) for
 Vitaminka , a Macedonian maker of branded foods.  The loan supports the purchase of packaging and other
equipment that will help  Vitaminka  cut costs and improve  energy
efficiency , the London-based lender said in an e-mailed
statement.  Vitaminka exports more than 40 percent of its output, which
includes its own branded items as well as confectionary, snacks,
powdered products, ketchup and mayonnaise for other private
labels, the EBRD said. It’s the bank’s second loan to the
Prilep-based company, following 4 million euros borrowed in
2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
