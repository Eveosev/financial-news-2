New York  gasoline weakened as U.S.
inventories reached an 11-month high and demand stayed below
2011 levels.  Gasoline stockpiles  expanded 1.63 million barrels to 231.8
million last week, the highest level since Feb. 25, according to
the Energy Department.  Demand (DOEDMGAS)  increased 0.3 percent to 8.04
million barrels a day.  Demand over four weeks  was 6.8 percent
below a year earlier.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  New
York Harbor (MOSNY87P)  fell 0.12 cent to 1.88 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:44 p.m. Prompt
delivery rose 4.65 cents to $2.994 a gallon.  ConocoPhillips started a compressor associated with the
flare-gas recovery system at its Wood River refinery in
 Illinois , according to a person with knowledge of the situation.  The discount versus futures for the same fuel in  Chicago (CHCG87PC) 
widened 8 cents to 29 cents a gallon. The prompt-delivery price
fell 3.28 cents to $2.6847 a gallon.  The compressor at Wood River was shut about 10 days ago
because of a malfunctioning motor and there have been multiple
attempts to start it, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the information isnâ€™t public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
