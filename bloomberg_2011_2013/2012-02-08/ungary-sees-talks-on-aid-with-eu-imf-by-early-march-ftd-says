Hungary’s government hopes to enter
negotiations with the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund  by early March “at the latest” to enable
financial aid payments,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported,
citing Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi.  The government plans to send proposals to the EU Commission
on remedying criticism of laws by mid-February, the newspaper
said, adding that the country’s political problems are linked to
the aid payments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
