Norilsk Nickel’s pension fund asked
the Federal Security Service to check if billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov ’s company managed the fund’s money properly in
2008-2009, Interfax reported today, citing a letter from the
fund’s executive to the FSB.  The fund claims that in 2008 Rosbank Managing Co., then
owned by Prokhorov’s Onexim Group, mismanaged 350 million rubles
($11.7 million) of the pension fund’s money by selling illiquid
shares of OAO Financial Leasing Co. from its portfolio to the
fund, according to the news service.  Prokhorov is running against Russian prime minister
Vladimir Putun in presidential elections scheduled on March 4.  Onexim’s press office and the FSB did not respond to
telephone calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
