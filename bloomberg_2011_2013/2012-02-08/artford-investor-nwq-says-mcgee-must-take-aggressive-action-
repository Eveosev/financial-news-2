Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG)  must take “aggressive action” to improve the stock price,
said NWQ Investment Management Co., one of the insurer’s largest
shareholders.  “It’s our view that it’s time for Hartford to take
aggressive action and deliver value to shareholders,” Tamara Kravec, a managing director with NWQ, said today in an
interview. “They have multiple avenues to unlock value. It
takes time.”  Hartford’s biggest investor, billionaire  John Paulson , told
Chief Executive Officer  Liam McGee  on a conference call today to
“do something drastic.” Paulson endorsed the analysis of
Christopher Giovanni, a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst, who
said Hartford should split its life-insurance and property-
casualty businesses. Hartford, based in the Connecticut city of
the same name, dropped 39 percent in New York last year.  “We have an incredible sense of urgency on looking at all
ideas to create  shareholder value ,” McGee said on the call.  NWQ held about 4.8 percent of Hartford as of Sept. 30,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Paulson & Co.’s stake
was about 8.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
