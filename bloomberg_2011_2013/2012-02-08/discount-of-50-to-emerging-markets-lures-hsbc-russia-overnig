Russian stocks will extend their best
start to a year since 2006 as valuations almost 50 percent below
 emerging markets  and political reform lure investors, according
to HSBC Global Asset Management. RTS futures climbed.  OAO Surgutneftegas , Russia’s fourth largest oil producer,
surged to the highest level since May 2008 in New York and
fellow energy companies  OAO Lukoil  and  OAO Gazprom , as well as
 OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel , the world’s largest producer of the
metal, also jumped. Futures expiring in March on the dollar-
denominated RTS index rose 0.9 percent to 165,045 in U.S.
trading. Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend, reached a
nine-month high of $118.01 per barrel.  Russia’s 30-stock Micex index has advanced 11 percent in
2012, and trades at 5.7 times analysts’ earnings estimates for
member companies, compared with 10.4 for the  MSCI Emerging
Markets Index  of developing-nation stocks. Prime Minister
 Vladimir Putin , running for president amid protests against
December elections that saw his United Russia party returned
with a reduced majority, has promised to reverse “repressive”
state policies and protect private business in his campaigning.  “There’s a lot of potential in Russia both on valuations
and a gradually progressing reform agenda, you can make money,
very good money, from having things go from being ‘not great’ to
‘not too bad,” Ed Conroy, who helps oversee $1.2 billion of
Russian assets as a  fund manager  at HSBC Global, said by phone
from  London  yesterday. “Russia trades at a 50 percent discount
to emerging markets, making this a reasonably good entry point
for investors with a two- to three-year view.”  UBS Upgrade  UBS AG raised its recommendation on  Russia  stocks to
“overweight” as the market benefits from a decline in equity
risk premium and the shares trade at a discount to global
markets, Nicholas Smithie, an analyst, wrote in a report dated
today. The report didn’t give the previous recommendation.  United Co. Rusal , the world’s largest aluminum producer,

level in six months in New York after reporting profit increased

yesterday.  Commodity Prices  Sberbank’s ADRs rose 1.9 percent to $12.75, the highest

the worst-performing stock on the  Bloomberg Russia-US 14 Index 
last year, fell 2.7 percent to $11.74.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, advanced 1 percent to $31.99. The  RTS
Volatility Index , which measures expected swings in the index
futures, rose for the second day in three, adding 3.9 percent to
33.47 points.  Jobless Rate  Crude traded in New York rose the most in three weeks
yesterday as the dollar fell against the euro after Federal

rate understates weakness in the nation’s labor market. Oil for

to $12.72 in New York, the highest level in six months. The
company’s Moscow-listed  shares  fell 0.9 percent to 188.11
rubles, or $6.31. One ADR represents two ordinary shares.  Nickel Taxes  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel,  which is also the world’s largest
