Tieto Oyj (TIE1V) , the largest Nordic
provider of computer services, climbed the most in more than two
years as new orders more than tripled.  Tieto rose as much as 17 percent, the most since March
2008, and closed 13 percent higher at 13 euros in Helsinki.
Tieto has climbed 18 percent this year, giving it a market value
of 936 million euros ($1.2 billion).  “New orders were significantly better than in the prior
quarter,” said Mikko Ervasti, an analyst at Evli Bank Oyj in
Helsinki. “The tremendous operating margin, positive outlook
and raised dividend are also boosting the share.”  Tieto’s orders more than tripled to 601 million euros last
quarter from 177 million euros in the July-to-September period.
The operating margin rose to 5.3 percent last quarter from 1.4
percent a year earlier. The Helsinki-based company said full-
year sales will develop in line with the market and its earnings
before interest and taxes will rise this year from last year’s
level.  Tieto proposed a dividend payout of 0.75 euros a share, the
highest since 2007. Bloomberg had  estimated  Tieto would maintain
the dividend at 0.70 euros a share. The company paid 0.54 euros
a share as a regular dividend and 0.66 euros a share in a
special cash payout five years ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
