Banco do Brasil SA ’s U.K. business
may see loan growth of more than 10 percent this year as it
steps in to serve clients affected by European banks curbing
lending amid the region’s debt crisis, according to Paulo Guimaraes, general manager of the  London  branch.  “We’ve seen a lot of opportunities, rather than crisis,”
Guimaraes said in an interview in London on Feb. 6. “Many banks
have reduced exposure to some companies in Latin America so it’s
a good opportunity to replace them.”  The combination of stricter  capital requirements  at banks
and a preference for hoarding cash or buying  government bonds 
instead of lending money to companies has reduced the supply of
corporate loans from European banks.  Last year, Banco do Brasil’s U.K. loan portfolio grew about
10 percent, according to Guimaraes. This year there is potential
for stronger growth, he said. Guimaraes said Banco do Brasil
doesn’t disclose loan volume details for the U.K.  Banco do Brasil’s U.K. operations finance Brazilian
companies that trade with or have operations in  Europe , as well
as some European companies with clients or subsidiaries in
Brazil, he said.  The bank’s consolidated loan portfolio grew 21 percent to
442 billion reais in the third quarter of 2011 from a year
earlier, according to the company’s Nov. 3 earnings statement.
The bank maintained its forecast for 15 percent to 18 percent
loan growth in Brazil in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
