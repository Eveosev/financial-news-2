Level 3 Communications Inc . gained
the most in almost six months after the broadband services
provider forecast that 2012 profit by one measure will rise as
much as 25 percent as online video drives demand.  Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization will increase by 20 percent to 25 percent from
a year earlier, the Broomfield, Colorado-based company said
today in a statement. Level 3 credited growth in its Core
Network Services revenue as well as “cost synergies” following
the October acquisition of Global Crossing Ltd.  The  shares  advanced 8.8 percent to $21.31 at the close in
New York for their biggest one-day gain since Aug. 9. They have
risen 15 percent this year.  “Their guidance is up 20 to 25 percent, and the CFO has a
long track record of underpromising,”  Donna Jaegers , a D.A.
Davidson & Co. analyst in Denver, said in a telephone interview.
She recommends buying the shares.  Chief Executive Officer James Crowe told analysts and
investors on a conference call that Level 3 stands to benefit
from “demand created by more and more video sold to individuals
at their home -- entertainment, gaming, etc. -- but also the
clearly growing demand to embed video in every enterprise
communication.”  Level 3’s fourth-quarter  net loss  widened to $163 million,
or 80 cents a share, from $52 million, or 47 cents, a year
earlier. Excluding some items, the loss was 62 cents a share,
the company said. The average of 11 analysts’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg was for an adjusted loss of $1.12 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
