Alibaba Group Holding Ltd . is aiming
to finalize terms of an about $3 billion loan by the end of this
week when commitments from the six arranging banks are due,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  Australia  and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Credit Suisse
Group AG, DBS Bank Ltd., Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc,
and Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. are arranging the loan, which
will be marketed to other banks in general syndication, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the details are
private.  Hong Kong-based spokesman for Alibaba, John Spelich,
declined to comment on the loan and the companyâ€™s acquisition
plans when contacted by telephone today.  The loan will include a one-year bridge facility and a
three-year amortizing term loan, said the person. The process of
syndication is still being decided and may include an early-bird
option, the person said.  Alibaba is borrowing the funds for a potential buyback of a
stake that Yahoo Inc. has in the company, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
