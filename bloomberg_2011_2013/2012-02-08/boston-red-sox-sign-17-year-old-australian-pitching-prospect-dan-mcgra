The  Boston Red Sox  signed 17-year-old
Australian pitcher Daniel McGrath to a professional contract,
his  Melbourne Aces  team said.  McGrath, who helped  Australia  win the recently concluded
Under-18 Oceania Baseball Championships in Guam, will join the
Major League Baseball club at spring training for three weeks in
April before returning home to finish high school.  “The big thing is that in  Boston  we don’t sign players
when they aren’t ready,” Jon Deeble, Boston’s pacific region
scout, said in a news release. “Dan will take his time to get
to where he needs to get and we’ll ensure that he has full use
of all of our support staff on that journey.”  The 6-foot-3 (1.91 meter) left-hander has made 12
appearances for the Aces in the Australian Baseball League this
season, going 0-3 with a 6.75 earned run average. He’s the
youngest player to have appeared in the ABL.  To contact the reporter on this story:
