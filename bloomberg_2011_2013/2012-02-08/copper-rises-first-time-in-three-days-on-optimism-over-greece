Copper futures rose to a 20-week high
after the government pledged to support first-time homebuyers in
 China , the world’s biggest consumer of the metal used in pipes
and wires.  Officials will boost support for affordable-housing
construction, the People’s Bank of China said yesterday. The
 Copper Development Association  estimates that builders account
for more than 40 percent of the metal’s use.  “Copper is particularly strong on news that China’s
central bank pledged yesterday to support the local housing
market, underpinning a key demand source for the metal,”  Edward Meir , an analyst at INTL FCStone Inc. in New York, said in a
report.  On the Comex in New York, copper futures for March delivery
advanced 0.9 percent to close at $3.9095 a pound at 1:19 p.m.,
the highest settlement for a most-active contract since Sept.
16. The price has gained 14 percent this year.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose 1.2 percent to $8,580 a metric ton ($3.89 a pound).  The price may reach $9,000 this month, Meir said.  Stockpiles monitored by the LME have slumped 15 percent
this year to the lowest since Sept. 8, 2009.  Tin, aluminum, nickel, lead and zinc fell on the LME.  To contact the reporters on this story:
