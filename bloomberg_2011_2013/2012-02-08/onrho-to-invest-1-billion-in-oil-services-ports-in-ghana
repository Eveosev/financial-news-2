Lonrho Plc (LAF)  will invest $1 billion to
build ports that will service oil rigs in  Ghana ’s Western
Region, a company official said.  “We anticipate spending $10 million for feasibility
studies for the deep water oil services ports,” Steven Gray,
the company’s development director, said in an interview today
in the capital, Accra. “The studies will end in August and if
that demonstrates viability and sustainability then construction
will start by the last quarter of this year.”  Ghana, which began exporting oil in 2010, plans to boost
output fivefold in the next five years as new wells come on
stream, Deputy Minister of Finance and Economic Planning Fifi Kwetey said yesterday. The country’s main Jubilee field pumped
about 85,000 barrels a day at the end of last year and  Tullow
Oil Plc , which operates the field, plans to increase production
to 120,000 barrels per day by 2013.  Preliminary studies show that there is need for dedicated
ports for the oil and gas industry with a “number of potential
tenants and users” showing interest in “Ghana as a regional
hub for their oil and gas operations,” Gray said. Lonrho plans
to invest “$400 million in the first phase,” increasing it to
$1 billion if demand warrants it.  The project is based on a 50-year concession split in two
periods of 25 years each, he said. The company signed a
memorandum of understanding with the government in August last
year to execute the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
