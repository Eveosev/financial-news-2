U.K. stocks  fell for a third day, the
longest losing streak in three weeks, amid concern Greece’s
political leaders might fail to reach a consensus on terms for a
second bailout.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  lost 2.3 percent after reporting its
first drop in first-half profit since 2009. International Power
slid 2.8 percent as it forecast weaker growth in 2012.  Reckitt
Benckiser Group Plc (RB/)  advanced 2.9 percent after saying sales
growth in 2012 will outpace the industry.  The  FTSE 100  Index fell 14.33, or 0.2 percent, to 5,875.93
at the close in London. The benchmark measure has still  rallied
19 percent  from last year’s lowest level as economic data
suggested the recovery in the  U.S. economy  is on track. The FTSE
All-Share Index also slipped 0.2 percent today, while Ireland’s
ISEQ Index lost 0.6 percent.  “The range on the FTSE 100 is less than 40 points today,
as indecision seems the most liquid commodity of the day,” said
Will Hedden, a sales trader at IG Index in London. “Risk-averse
traders will still highlight the event risk from a Greek
default, but in reality I think the worry is how this would
affect the rest of the peripheries and the game plan from a
German perspective.”  Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  began negotiations on
spending cuts with political leaders today after delaying the
meeting twice in as many days. Papademos held an unscheduled
meeting last night with the so-called troika --comprising the
European Commission, the  European Central Bank  and the
 International Monetary Fund  -- to discuss the final terms of the
bailout.  BHP Drops  BHP Billiton , the world’s biggest mining company, lost 2.3
percent to 2,130 pence after the company said first-half net
income fell to $9.9 billion from $10.5 billion a year earlier.  International Power slid 2.8 percent to 333 pence after the
electricity-plant operator said 2012 sales growth will be
affected by “contracts rolling off” in  North America  and fewer
expected liquid natural gas diversions.  Centrica Plc (CNA) , the U.K.’s biggest supplier of gas and
electricity, fell 2.7 percent to 294.5 pence as Malaysia’s
Petroliam Nasional Bhd. started selling its entire stake of
199.4 million shares.  SuperGroup Plc (SGP)  tumbled 17 percent to 579.5 pence, the
biggest drop since October. The owner of the Superdry clothing
chain forecast that annual pretax profit will be at the “lower
end” of analyst estimates because of a tough start to 2012.  HomeServe Plc (HSV) , a provider of emergency-repair services,
plunged 13 percent to 240.1 pence, the largest decline in three
months. The company forecast that U.K. customer numbers will
fall about 8 percent in fiscal 2012.  Reckitt Benckiser climbed 2.9 percent to 3,479 pence. The
maker of Dettol handwash said sales in 2012 will grow at a
faster pace than the industry and reported fourth-quarter
earnings that beat analyst estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
