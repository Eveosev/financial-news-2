Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , the life
insurer that expanded in  Japan  through acquisitions, said
fourth-quarter profit more than tripled on non-U.S. earnings and
narrower losses from investments and derivatives.  Net income advanced to $686 million from $177 million in
the same period a year earlier,  Newark , New Jersey-based
Prudential said today in a statement distributed by  Business
Wire . Operating profit, which excludes results of policies sold
before the company went public and some investments, was $1.97 a
share, beating the $1.76  average estimate  of 18 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer John Strangfeld spent more than $4
billion last year to buy two Japanese subsidiaries from  American
International Group Inc. (AIG)  The units, Star Life Insurance Co. and
Edison Life Insurance Co., are being combined with a business
that Prudential has built in Japan for two decades. The insurer
uses derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in currencies and
 interest rates .  “Pru should realize margin expansion from Star-Edison cost
saves,” said  Suneet Kamath , an analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co., in an interview before results were released.
Kamath has an “outperform” rating on the insurer.  Prudential, the second-biggest U.S. life insurer, has
gained 21 percent since Dec. 31 in New York trading. Last year
the company fell 15 percent, while No. 1  MetLife Inc. (MET)  declined
30 percent. The insurer advanced 21 cents after results were
released to $60.75 in extended trading at 4:44 p.m. in New York.  Book Value  Book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, rose to
$75.04 a share at the main business, from $74.52 on Sept. 30.
Net unrealized gains on fixed maturity holdings at the main
portfolio climbed to $10.5 billion on Dec. 31 from $9.8 billion
at the end of September.  Full-year net income rose to $3.53 billion in 2011 from
$2.71 billion a year earlier, as the company benefited from a
larger non-U.S. business.  Prudential’s international insurance business posted $692
million in adjusted fourth-quarter operating income, up from
$588 million in the year-earlier period. The segment recorded
$94 million in costs tied to integrating Star and Edison and a
benefit of $96 million from the sale of a private pension fund
manager in  Mexico .  ‘More Focused’  The “addition of the Star and Edison businesses in Japan
and divestiture of several non-core operations have made us a
stronger, more focused company,” Strangfeld, 58, said in the
statement.  Prudential had realized investment losses of $568 million,
compared with a loss of $906 million in the year-earlier period,
tied in part to derivatives. A jump in interest rates in the
final three months of 2010 hurt derivatives results at life
insurers that hedge their bond portfolios against declines in
yields.  The yield on  two-year U.S. Treasuries  slipped 1.6 percent
in the fourth quarter, compared with a surge of 41 percent in
the same period of 2010.  Net sales of individual annuities fell to $2.9 billion from
$4.2 billion a year earlier, the insurer said. Operating income
from the retirement products advanced to $391 million from $345
million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
