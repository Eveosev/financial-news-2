Vivendi SA (VIV) â€™s telecommunications unit
SFR and  Dassault Systemes SA (DSY)  are bidding together for a cloud
computing contract partly financed by the French state, Nicolas
Chatin, a spokesman for SFR, said today.  Paris-based Dassault Systemes pulled out of a competing
group, comprising  France Telecom SA (FTE)  and defense group Thales SA,
in December.  SFR and Dassault will invest 75 million euros ($99 million)
each in the project, forecast to generate 1 billion euros of
sales in 2020, French weekly magazine  Challenges  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
