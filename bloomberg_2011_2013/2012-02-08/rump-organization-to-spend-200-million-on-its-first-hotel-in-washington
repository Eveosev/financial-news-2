Trump Organization, headed by  Donald Trump , the developer and reality-television star, plans to spend
almost $200 million on its first hotel in  Washington .  The  U.S. General Services Administration  selected the New
York-based company to redevelop the historic Old Post Office
building, located at 12th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, into a
250-room luxury hotel with a restaurant, spa and conference
facilities, the agency said in a  statement  today.  Trump Organization is seeking to profit from demand from
government, business and leisure travelers to the city, said
Ivanka Trump, the company’s executive vice president of
development and acquisitions. Hotel occupancy in the capital was
69 percent last year through November, higher than the 61
percent rate for the entire U.S., according to  Smith Travel
Research Inc.  of Hendersonville,  Tennessee .  “A new luxury hotel hasn’t been introduced to D.C. in
years, and there is no current pipeline of luxury hotel product
given the lack of great available locations and the high cost of
land and development,” Ivanka Trump said in a telephone
interview today.  Trump Organization will spend almost $200 million on the
project, the  General Services Administration  said. The agency
and Trump Organization will devote a year to negotiating the
agreement for the building’s redevelopment. Construction is
expected to start in 2014 and be completed within two years
after that, Ivanka Trump said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
