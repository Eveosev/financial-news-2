Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP)  rose 5.1
percent in Lisbon trading on speculation the planned leadership
change at  Portugal ’s second-biggest bank is prompting investors
to exit trades betting on a decline.  Banco Comercial said on Jan. 30 that Chief Executive
Officer Carlos Santos Ferreira was stepping aside from his post
and would likely be replaced by Nuno Amado, former CEO at the
Portuguese unit of  Banco Santander SA. (SAN)  Amado’s appointment must
still be approved by shareholders.  The shares surged to their highest close since Sept. 30,
extending yesterday’s 21 percent increase. They’re up 39 percent
since Amado’s appointment was announced. Other banks also rose
in Lisbon, with  Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES)  and  Banco BPI SA (BPI) 
climbing 13 percent and 15 percent respectively.  “Short sellers have been closing their positions in Banco
Comercial as a change in leadership may open a new chapter for
the bank,” said Jose Novo, a trader at Orey iTrade in Lisbon.
“Other banks are benefiting from BCP’s rise.”  In a short sale, investors sell borrowed stock, hoping to
profit by buying the shares back later at a lower price.  BCP shares advanced 0.9 euro cents to close at 18.5 cents
in Lisbon, and earlier rose as much as 24 percent. About 502
million shares were traded today, more than six times the daily
average volume of the past six months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
