Turkey  sold 10-year dollar bonds for
the second time in three weeks, seeking to benefit from the
lowest borrowing costs in two months as concern about the crisis
in  Europe  eased.  The  Treasury  in Ankara sold $1 billion of bonds due Sept.
26, 2022, to yield 5.75 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The country first sold $1.5 billion of the bonds at
6.35 percent on Jan. 18, when demand was about three times the
amount on offer. Yields on Turkish debt maturing in March 2022
traded at 5.5 percent today, after touching a two-month low of
5.47 percent yesterday.  Investors are returning to Turkey as U.S. and European
Union policy makers drive down  interest rates  and increase
access to cash. Banks including Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan
Chase & Co. say Turkey’s record  current account deficit  may have
peaked, boosting confidence in an economy that grew 9.6 percent
in the first nine months of last year.  “It is pretty clear that Turkish Treasury wants to benefit
from extremely abundant global liquidity conditions and positive
sentiment, which is good news as global sentiment could change
very quickly,”  Ozgur Altug , chief economist at BGC Partners in
Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments to clients.  Turkey hired Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc., and Credit
Suisse Group AG to arrange the sale, the Treasury said in a
statement on its website today.  Yields on the September 2022 bonds being offered today were
at 5.73 percent at 3:34 p.m. New York time. Yields on similar
bonds in  Serbia , which has the same ‘BB’ rating as Turkey at
 Standard & Poor’s , trade at 7.38 percent.  Turkish Stocks  Turkish  stocks  gained, with the benchmark index rising 1
percent to 61,178.25, the highest level since August. Yields on
 two-year lira bonds  fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 9.33 percent. The lira fell 0.1 percent from a three-
month high to 1.7505 per dollar.  The country plans about 9.5 billion liras ($5.2 billion) in
external borrowing this year. Turkey had $2.7 billion in
external debt repayments of capital and interest coming due in
January and February, according to information in the Treasury’s
latest debt-management report.  Moody’s Investors Service rates Turkey Ba2, two steps below
investment grade, with a “positive” outlook.  Fitch Ratings ,
which ranks Turkey at BB+, one step below investment-grade
status, cut the country’s outlook to “stable” from
“positive” on Nov. 23, citing accelerating inflation and a
widening current account deficit. Standard & Poor’s rating puts
Turkey at two steps below investment grade.  The current account gap narrowed for the first time in two
years in November, reducing the 12-month cumulative deficit to
$77.8 billion, or about 10 percent of estimated gross domestic
product. The  budget deficit  for last year was about 1.4 percent
of GDP, Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek said on Jan. 16.  To contact the reporters on this story:
