Solarhybrid AG , which bought the U.S.
project pipeline of insolvent competitor  Solar Millenium AG  last
week, plans to sell a part of the projects instead of developing
them,  Die Welt  reported, citing Chief Financial Officer Albert Klein.  Proceeds from the sale would also bring funds to Solar
Millenium more quickly, the newspaper cited Klein as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
