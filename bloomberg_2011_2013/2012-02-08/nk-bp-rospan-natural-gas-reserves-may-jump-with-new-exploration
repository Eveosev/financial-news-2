  TNK-BP ,  Russia ’s third-largest oil
producer, may boost natural gas reserves at its Rospan unit to 1
trillion cubic meters from about 600 billion cubic meters after
additional exploration.  The company aims to increase the northern Siberian unit’s
reserves by adding gas resources sought in a new geological
layer, TNK-BP Vice President Victor Blagoveschenskiy told
journalists in Moscow today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
