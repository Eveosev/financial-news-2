Japanese  stock   futures  were little
changed, after the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average climbed above 9,000
for the first time since October yesterday, as investors await
further developments from Greece. Australian equities fell.  American depositary receipts Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc., Japan’s biggest lender, slid 1 percent from the close in

8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.2
percent percent today, while New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained
0.2 percent in Wellington.  “History tells us that a deal in  Greece  will be reached at
the last minute,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of
investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has
almost $100 billion under management. “A lot of indications
show they are heading in that direction even though there are
endless delays.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.2 percent
today. The benchmark gauge advanced 0.2 percent to a seven-month
high in  New York  yesterday as Greek Prime Minister  Lucas
Papademos  met with domestic political leaders to discuss terms
required to secure a second bailout for it sovereign debt.  The rescue is slated to include a 50 percent cut in the
face value of more than 200 billion euros ($265 billion) of
Greek debt through a voluntary exchange by private creditors of
outstanding bonds for new securities. The package is also
supposed to offer 130 billion euros in public aid.  Emergency Meeting  Euro-area finance ministers are due to hold an emergency
meeting in Brussels today as Greece pushes to complete talks.
The policy makers will be joined by International Monetary Fund
chief  Christine Lagarde .  “It’s certainly a risk if Greece doesn’t come up with an
agreement either with private investors or the troika or both,”
said AMP’s Oliver. If they don’t “they will default.”  The benchmark  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  jumped 1.3 percent to
a six-month high yesterday as Greece edged closer to securing a
