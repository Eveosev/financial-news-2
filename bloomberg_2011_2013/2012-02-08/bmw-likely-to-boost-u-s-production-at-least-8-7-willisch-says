Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
world’s largest maker of luxury autos, probably will make more
than 300,000 vehicles in the U.S. for the first time in 2012,
the chief executive officer of its  North America  unit said.  BMW is looking for the “best and most efficient way to get
beyond” that production total in 2012, Ludwig Willisch, CEO of
BMW of North America, said in a Feb. 5 interview. Output of
300,000 vehicles from BMW’s plant in Spartanburg, South
Carolina, would be an increase of 8.7 percent from the 276,065
the company said it made there last year.  “The market is so bullish, we could sell more than
originally anticipated,” Willisch said on the sidelines of the
National Automobile Dealers Association’s annual convention in
 Las Vegas . “Clearly, the demand is there.”  BMW said Jan. 12 that it will invest about $900 million in
its only U.S. factory to boost capacity and to prepare the
facility for making the new X4 sport-utility vehicle. The
spending, to be completed during a three-year span, will help
increase capacity at Spartanburg to 350,000 vehicles a year, the
Munich-based company said in a  statement . The factory already
makes X3, X5 and X6 SUVs.  BMW’s forecast exceeds production estimates by IHS
Automotive, which sees output from Spartanburg falling to about
260,000 this year, Tracy Handler, a Troy, Michigan-based
analyst, said in a phone interview.  “They’re probably looking at a little bit stronger U.S.
sales than what we have,” IHS’s Handler said. “We had good
momentum the first month of the year, but we’re still pretty
cautious on what’s going to happen and if anything happens in
 Greece  and in  Europe  and how that would affect us here.”  More than 70 percent of BMW’s vehicles made in Spartanburg
are exported. The company’s sales headquarters for North America
is in Woodcliff Lake,  New Jersey .  BMW, which is fending off efforts by  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi
and  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz to take the industry’s top luxury
sales spot, targets sales of more than 2 million vehicles by
2020. The company sold 1.67 million BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce
cars last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
