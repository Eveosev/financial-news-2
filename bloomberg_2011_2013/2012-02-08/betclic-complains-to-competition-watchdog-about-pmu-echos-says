Betclic Enterprises Ltd. complained
to the French competition regulator that Pari Mutuel Urbain has
unfair weight in internet-based horse-race betting,  Les Echos 
said, without indicating where it got the information.  PMU is dominant even after the sector was opened to
competition in June 2010, the newspaper said.  Les Echos cited Jean-Francois Vilotte, the president of
French gaming regulator Arjel, as saying yesterday that PMU’s
principal rival Zeturf had about 10 percent market share and
other operators were “marginal.” Vilotte shared his views with
the competition authority, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
