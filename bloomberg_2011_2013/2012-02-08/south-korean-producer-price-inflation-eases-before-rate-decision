South Korean producer prices rose at
the slowest pace in 17 months in January, according to a report
released hours before a central bank decision is due on
benchmark  interest rates .  Prices (KOPPIYOY)  climbed 3.4 percent from a year earlier after a 4.3
percent increase in December, the  Bank of Korea  said in a
statement in Seoul today. They rose 0.7 percent from December.  The central bank will keep the benchmark  seven-day
repurchase rate  unchanged at 3.25 percent, according to 18 of 19
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. One analyst sees a cut to
3 percent. The decision is due this morning.  “We expect the central bank to keep rates at 3.25 percent
this month to gain more information before potentially cutting
in March,” Ronald Man, a Hong Kong-based analyst at HSBC
Holdings Plc. said before today’s data.  Today’s report showed the cost of fruit fell about 20
percent in January from a year earlier. The price of vegetables
slid 14 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
