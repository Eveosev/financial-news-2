     Feb. 8 (Bloomberg) --  Center Parcs Ltd. (CPK) , which is owned by
 Blackstone Group LP (BX) , plans to offer 1 billion pounds ($1.6
billion) of bonds secured on the U.K. holiday club’s business to
refinance debt.  Center Parcs is selling 740 million pounds of class A bonds
and 270 million pounds of class B notes, according to three
people with knowledge of the transaction, who declined to be
identified before the deal is completed.  The proceeds will refinance commercial mortgage-backed
securities first issued in 2007 by CPUK Morgtage Finance Ltd., a
special purpose company set up to package Center Parcs loans
into bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. New York-
based Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity firm,
bought Center Parcs in 2006.  The so-called  whole-business securitization  will be backed
by the assets and revenue from four Center Parcs villages in
Nottinghamshire, Wiltshire, Suffolk and Cumbria, said the
people. In whole-business securitizations, investors get rights
usually held by shareholders, such as changing management if
terms of the notes are breached. In return, the borrower gets
higher credit ratings, reducing interest costs.  Center Parcs’s press office didn’t respond to a phone call
and e-mail for comment.  Blackstone and Center Parcs plan to meet with investors
starting today in  London  and Edinburgh to discuss the
transaction, the people said.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc,  Barclays Capital , HSBC
Holdings Plc and Lloyds Banking Group Plc are managing the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
