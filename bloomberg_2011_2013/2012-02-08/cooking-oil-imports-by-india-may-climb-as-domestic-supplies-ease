India , the world’s biggest palm oil
buyer, probably imported more cooking oils last month after
prices had the first monthly decline since September and
domestic supplies dropped, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Purchases  climbed to 700,000 metric tons in January from
691,780 tons a year earlier, according to a median estimate of
four processors and brokers surveyed by Bloomberg News last
week. Palm oil imports increased 8.5 percent to 555,000 tons,
the survey showed. The Solvent Extractors’ Association of India
is scheduled to release the monthly imports data on Feb. 15.  Rising Indian imports may help palm  oil prices  in Malaysia
rebound after plunging 16 percent in 2011, the first annual loss
in three years, on higher global supplies and weak demand due to
the European debt crisis. Imports from Indonesia and Malaysia
make up almost 80 percent of India’s cooking oil purchases.  “The domestic oilseed crop has not been as good as we had
thought because of unseasonal rains and may be lower than
estimates,” Govindlal G. Patel, a managing director at GG Patel
& Nikhil Research Co., said by phone from the Indian city of
Ahmedabad. “This will push up imports this year.”  Soybean production in India may be 10.5 million tons in the
year that began on Oct. 1, less than the 11.94 million tons
estimated by the Soybean Processors Association of India, while
rapeseed output may decline by as much as 1 million tons from
the 7 million tons last year, said Patel, who has traded edible
oils for more than four decades.  India may import 9.3 million tons of edible oils in the
year ending Oct. 31, Patel said. It bought 8.4 million tons last
year, according to the solvent extractors’ association.  Sunflower Oil  The April-delivery contract on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange closed at 1 percent higher at 3,085 ringgit ($1,022) a
ton in  Kuala Lumpur  on Feb. 3. Futures lost 3.1 percent in
January, the first drop in four months.  India’s soybean oil imports may be 50,000 tons in January,
compared with 49,520 tons a year earlier, and sunflower oil
imports may drop to 90,000 tons from 117,499 tons, the survey
showed.  “Imports were higher during January as domestic prices
were ruling more than the international rates,” Ashok Sethia,
who is on the managing committee of the  Solvent Extractors’
Association of India,  said by phone from Kolkata. Soybean oil
prices were quoted 3,000 rupees ($61) a ton more than the
imported oil as there was a shortage of inventory after farmers
withheld supplies, he said.  Edible oil stockpiles at Indian ports may be about 500,000
tons at the end of January from about 450,000 tons in December,
said Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive officer of Mumbai-based
Sunvin Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
