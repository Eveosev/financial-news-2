Asia gasoil refining profits fell for
the first time in three days. The viscosity spread, or 180-
centistoke  fuel oil ’s premium to the 380-centistoke grade, was
at the widest in almost a week.  Middle Distillates  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Dubai crude fell 17
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $18.51 a barrel at 10:22 a.m.
Singapore time, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.
This  crack spread  was at $18.93 a barrel on Jan. 30, the widest
in two weeks.  March  gasoil  swaps decreased 5 cents to $131.75 a barrel,
PVM said. Jet fuel was at a discount of 65 cents to gasoil,
unchanged from yesterday. This  regrade  has been negative since
Jan. 16, signaling it is unprofitable to make  aviation fuel  over
diesel.  Fuel Oil  High-sulfur fuel oil  swaps for March declined 75 cents, or
0.1 percent, to $711.25 a metric ton, based on PVM data.  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude widened 24 cents, or 6.6
percent, to $3.82 a barrel, PVM data showed. The fuel was at a
premium of 91 cents to the oil on Jan. 27, the biggest refining
profit from making the fuel since Bloomberg started tracking the
data in August 2006.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade gained 25 cents to $9.75 a ton. This  viscosity spread  is
at the widest since Feb. 2, signaling that prices of power-
generation fuel are outpacing the lower quality marine fuel
grade.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
dropped to $114.85 a ton at 11 a.m. Singapore time from $118.32
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack

the biggest weekly decline since Nov. 11.  Benchmark Japan  naphtha  swaps fell $4.75, or 0.5 percent,
