John Paulson , the billionaire hedge
fund manager who controls the largest stake in  Hartford
Financial Services Group Inc. (HIG) , told Chief Executive Officer Liam McGee he needs to reverse the insurer’s stock slide.  “Hartford needs to do something drastic because the stock
is the  lowest valuation  relative to book value of any major
insurance company,” Paulson said today at a conference call for
analysts and investors held by Hartford, which is based in the
Connecticut city of the same name.  Hartford hired advisers to evaluate splitting the life
insurance and  property-casualty  businesses, the company said
today. McGee, who was hired in 2009, told analysts before
Paulson spoke that dividing the firm would present “significant
challenges” for the insurer.  “What I’d like to see you do is not merely come back and
say, ‘Yes, we’re looking at strategic options but there’s
challenges,’” Paulson said. “How long do we have to wait to
hear if there’s going to be a positive recommendation to
separate these two businesses?”  Hartford jumped 7.3 percent to $20.51 at 10:20 a.m. in  New
York . The insurer declined 39 percent last year and trades at
less than half of the company’s book value, which is a measure
of assets minus liabilities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
