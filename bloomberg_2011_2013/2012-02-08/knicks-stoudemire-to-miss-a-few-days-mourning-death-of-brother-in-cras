New York Knicks  forward Amar’e Stoudemire will be away from the team until Feb. 13 following
the death of his brother in a car accident.  “I am humbled by all of the thoughts and prayers I have
received,” Stoudemire said in a statement released by the
Knicks. “Thank you for all of the support. I am going to take a
few days to be with my family and grieve the loss of my big
brother, Hazell Stoudemire. Although it is not clear to me now,
I hope to make some good come from our tragedy.”  Knicks coach  Mike D’Antoni  told reporters today at a
practice prior to tonight’s game at the  Washington Wizards  that
Stoudemire will return to the team Feb. 13, Jonathan Supranowitz, a spokesman for the team, confirmed in an e-mail.  Stoudemire, 29, missed the Knicks’ game on Feb. 6 against
the  Utah Jazz , a 99-88 win at Madison Square Garden in New York.
New York (10-15) also plays Feb. 10 at home against the Los
Angeles Lakers and the following day at the Minnesota
Timberwolves prior to Stoudemire’s return.  Hazell Stoudemire was 35 when he died two days ago in Lake
Wales, Florida, after his car collided with the rear of a
tractor-trailer. The family is from Cypress Creek, Florida.  In his second season with the Knicks, Stoudemire’s 18.2
points and 8.1 rebounds per game both rank second on the team.
He’s a 10-year National Basketball Association veteran.  To contact the reporter on this story:
