Peru’s benchmark sol-denominated
bonds rose, pushing down yields for the first time in three
days, after Finance Minister Miguel Castilla said the economy
expanded faster than the government expected in December.  The yield on the nation’s 7.84 percent bond due August 2020
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.65 percent
at 11:48 a.m. in  Lima , according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The security’s price gained 0.09 centimo to 114.60
centimos per sol.  Peruvian economic activity rose by about 6 percent in
December, accelerating for the first time since July, as public
investment rose, Castilla said yesterday. The government is
bringing forward infrastructure spending as part of a $3.5
billion drive to offset weaker demand for the country’s metal
and manufacturing exports.  “Peru’s outlook is very enviable,” said Aryam Vazquez, a
New York based-economist at  Wells Fargo & Co . “The Peru story
is the fundamental driver behind this push for the country’s
bonds. The fiscal stimulus certainly has to do with it.”  Castilla said the government may revise its forecast for
2011 economic growth, which will be reported Feb. 28, to about 7
percent from 6.8 percent.  The sol gained 0.1 percent to 2.6880 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.69 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
