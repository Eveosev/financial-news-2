(Corrects period for pretax profit in second paragraph.)  United Bank for Africa Plc , a
Nigerian lender with operations in 19 countries, retreated after
saying it expects to post a loss for last year.  The stock fell 0.5 percent, after earlier declining the
maximum daily limit of 5 percent, to close at 1.99 naira in
Lagos trading.  The bank expects a loss for 2011, “driven principally by
one-off write-offs against earnings, including those arising
from the transfer of loans to the Asset Management Company of
Nigeria,” it said in a statement e-mailed from the Nigerian
stock exchange today. Management doesn’t anticipate similar
write-offs in 2012, and pretax profit is seen at 15 billion
naira ($94 million) in the first quarter of this year, the
company said.  Nigeria  implemented banking reforms following a debt crisis
in 2008 and 2009 triggered by loans given to stock market
speculators. The central bank fired eight chief executives of
the country’s 24 banks and set up Amcon to buy the debts and
stabilize the banking sector. The central bank introduced a
December common year-end for the country’s lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
