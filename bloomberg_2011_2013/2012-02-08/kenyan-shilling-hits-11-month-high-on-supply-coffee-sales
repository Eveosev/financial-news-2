Kenya ’s shilling strengthened to its
highest in eleven months as the central bank offered to mop up
 money supply  and on increased dollar inflows from coffee sales.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy appreciated
0.8 percent to 82.80 per dollar as of 12:51 p.m. in the capital,
Nairobi. A close at this level would be the highest since March
2, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank is offering 2 billion shillings ($24
million) of seven-day  repurchase agreements  to mop up liquidity,
an official at the Nairobi-based bank, who declined to be
identified in line with policy, said by phone today.  Kenya’s weekly coffee sale rose 20 percent to 7,896 bags,
worth $2.69 million compared to last week’s auction, Nairobi
Coffee Exchange said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  Tanzania’s shilling appreciated 0.5 percent to trade at
1,590 as of 12:46 p.m., while the Ugandan shilling weakened 0.2
percent to 2,315 per dollar.  -- Editors: Peter Branton, Wojciech Moskwa  To contact the reporter on this story:
