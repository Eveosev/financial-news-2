The Serbian dinar fell to the lowest
in 15 months as the currency broke through a stop-loss level
recommended by banks in the Balkan country.  The currency was trading down 0.16 percent to 108.3483
against the euro, heading for the lowest close since Nov. 4,
2010.  “Two days ago, there was client demand, and today, it’s
mainly about position squaring and stop-losses,” said
Aleksandar Jaredic, head of Treasury at the Belgrade-based unit
of Oesterreichische Volksbank AG.  The dinar decline comes just a week after banks, including
 Societe Generale  SA, said in reports that the dinar was likely
to gain within three months as foreign investors buy Serbian
debt. Societe Generale issued a ’buy’ recommendation at 106.38
and a stop-loss level at 108.60.  To contact the reporters on this story:
