The Pirate Party, which campaigns for
open access to technology and Internet freedom, has established
a political presence in  Greece .  The  Pirate Party of Greece  will hold a press conference
Feb. 10 in central Athens to unveil its platform which includes
opposition to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, or ACTA,
according to an e-mailed statement from the group.  In a monthly poll by Public Issue for Skai TV and the
newspaper Kathimerini, 30 percent of those surveyed said they
would not vote for any of Greece’s existing parties and 91
percent said the country is headed in the wrong direction.
National elections in Greece are expected some time in April.  Germany’s Pirate Party took 9.1 percent of the vote in
regional elections in Berlin in September to win its first seats
in any legislature in  Germany ’s 16 states. The Pirate Party
currently has two Members of European Parliament, 15
parliamentarians and 194 city councilors elected throughout
 Europe , the group said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
