Rick Santorum  won the Colorado
caucuses, the state Republican chairman said, to give him a
sweep in all three contests held yesterday and deal a setback to
Mitt Romney in the party’s presidential race.  The chairman, Ryan Call, said in an interview with CNN that
Santorum won, based on 98 percent of the precincts reporting.
The former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania had 38 percent of the
vote with 79 precincts reporting, according to the  Associated
Press .  Romney, the race’s front-runner following wins in Florida’s
Jan. 31 primary and Nevada’s Feb. 4 caucuses, had 35 percent,
according to the AP tally.  Santorum won yesterday’s non-binding primary in Missouri
and caucuses in Minnesota. Romney was second in  Missouri  and
third in Minnesota, where U.S. Representative Ron Paul of Texas
ran ahead of him.  Santorum aims to establish himself as the main alternative
to Romney in the party’s presidential race.  To contact the reporters on this story:
