Vietnam ’s dong climbed for a second
day on speculation demand for foreign currencies will weaken as
the nation’s imports slow and the trade deficit narrows.
 Government bonds  fell.  The country’s  trade gap  shrank to $100 million from a
revised $269 million in December, as imports declined to $6.6
billion from $9.36 billion, according to preliminary data
released Feb. 2 by the General Statistics Office in Hanoi.  “The trade deficit has been gradually narrowing in recent
years,” researchers Tai Hui, Jennifer Kusuma and Thomas Harr at
 Standard Chartered  Plc in Singapore wrote in a report today.
That means “more support for the Vietnam dong, at least in the
short term,” they wrote.  The currency rose 0.2 percent, to 20,913 as of 2:56 p.m.
local time, headed for the strongest close since Jan. 30,
according to prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since
Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency is allowed to
trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  Standard Chartered raised its forecast for the exchange
rate by the end of the year to 21,700 from 22,600.  In the so-called black market, the dong traded between
20,940 and 20,980 per dollar at gold shops in Hanoi today,
compared with between 21,010 and 21,040 on Feb. 1, according to
a telephone information service run by state-owned Vietnam Posts
& Telecommunications.  The  yield  on benchmark five-year government bonds added two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 12.37 percent today,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
