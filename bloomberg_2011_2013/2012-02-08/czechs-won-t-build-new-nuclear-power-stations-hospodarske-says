The Czech Republic won’t build new
nuclear power plants and instead plans to expand its existing
capacity, abandoning the envisaged construction of as many as 18
new reactors,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing a minister.  A realistic plan is to build two new reactors at the
Temelin power plant and extend operations of the Dukovany
station until 2035, the newspaper said, citing an interview with
Industry and Trade Minister Martin Kuba.  To contact the reporter on this story:
