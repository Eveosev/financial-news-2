Banco BTG Pactual SA, the Brazilian
bank led by billionaire  Andre Esteves , plans to create an
investment fund of at least 3 billion reais ($1.75 billion) to
tap infrastructure development in Latin America’s biggest
economy.  “We are raising money for an infrastructure fund that will
be very big,” Esteves told reporters today in Sao Paulo,
without disclosing the total size of the fund. It will invest in
projects for railways, roads, airports and ports, amid other
infrastructure opportunities in Brazil, he said.  BTG’s  Brasil Energia (FIPBREN) , a fund that invests in the Brazilian
energy sector, is in the process of divestment and will generate
a “big profit” for the bank, pension funds and the country’s
development bank, known as BNDES, which are its main investors,
Esteves said. The fund’s total assets were 1.52 billion reais on
Feb 6, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
