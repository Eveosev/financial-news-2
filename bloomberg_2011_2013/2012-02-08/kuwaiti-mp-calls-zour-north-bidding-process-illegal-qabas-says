Kuwaiti opposition lawmaker Ahmed Al-
Saadoun said the process of choosing bidders for one of the
country’s biggest power projects violates the law,  Al-Qabas 
reported.  The Partnerships Technical Bureau, which supervises the
government’s public-private partnership program, said on Feb. 5
that it has three valid bids to build the Al-Zour North power
plant and will choose the winner within two weeks.  The process adopted is a “huge scandal that must be
stopped by the cabinet immediately for breaching legal
procedures,” Al-Saadoun said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
