Gambian President Yahya Jammeh
announced three more Cabinet appointments, including Mamadou
Tangara as foreign minister.  Jammeh also named Abdou Kolley as fisheries and water
resources minister, and Mariama Sarr Ceesay as minister for
higher education, according to a statement from the president’s
office published in the Banjul-based  Daily Observer  newspaper
yesterday. Kolley was previously the West African nation’s trade
minister, while Tangara and Ceesay resume roles they had before
the Cabinet was dissolved on Feb. 2, it said.  On Feb. 2, Jammeh appointed Mamburay Njie as finance
minister; Fatou Mass Jobe as minister of tourism; Ousman Sonko
as minister of the interior; and Isatou Njie Saidy as vice
president and minister of women’s affairs. All four served in
the previous Cabinet.  Jammeh, who has ruled Gambia since seizing power in a coup
in 1994, won a fourth term in office in elections in November.
The vote was condemned by the Economic Community of West African
States, which refused to send observers saying the political
environment wasn’t conducive to free and fair elections.  Of the 21 positions in Gambia’s previous Cabinet, 14 posts
remain to be filled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
