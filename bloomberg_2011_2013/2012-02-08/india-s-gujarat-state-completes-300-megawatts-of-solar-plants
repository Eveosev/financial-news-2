India ’s Gujarat state, home to the
country’s largest solar program, has completed 300 megawatts of
sun-powered plants, about a third of its target.  An additional 300 megawatts of projects are almost finished
and awaiting connections to power transmission infrastructure.
They should be ready in about 15 days, Iswarbhai Bhavsar,
chairman of the Gujarat Energy Development Agency, the state-run
body overseeing the program, said in a phone interview today.  Gujarat had set a Jan. 28 deadline for 958 megawatts of
capacity. Photovoltaic plants that missed the cut-off will get
33 percent less for the power they produce, the state
electricity commission said last week.  Movya, an Ahmedabad-based consulting firm, published a list
of the 600 megawatts of projects completed or near completion on
its  website  that includes those by developers  Adani Enterprises
Ltd.  and  MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. ’s SunEdison unit. Movya
Chief Executive Nilesh Patel said the information was obtained
from officials he declined to identify in the Gujarat
government.  Bhavsar said he was unaware of the list and couldn’t
confirm its accuracy. Gujarat Energy Secretary D.J. Pandian
didn’t respond to e-mails and phone calls seeking confirmation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
