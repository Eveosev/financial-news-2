The rand advanced against the dollar
for the first time in three days as commodities and stocks
gained on speculation  Greece  is making progress on measures
needed to win international aid.  South Africa ’s currency appreciated as much as 0.5 percent
to 7.5205 per dollar, the strongest level this week. It traded
at 0.1 percent stronger at 7.5527 as of 5.05 p.m. in
Johannesburg. Against the euro it traded up 0.2 percent at
10.0054.  Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  will meet with the
nation’s political leaders to negotiate terms required for a 130
billion-euro ($172 billion) rescue package.  Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Index  of raw materials rose to a six-month high and South
Africa’s benchmark stock  index  rose for the first day in three,
tracking a rally in global  emerging-market equities.   “With commodity prices still firm and markets hopeful of a
positive conclusion to the Greek talks, the mood is still
largely risk-on,” Nomvuyo Guma, a currency strategist at
Standard Bank Group Ltd. in Johannesburg, said in e-mailed
comments. “This should keep the rand on the front foot for
now.”  Raw materials account for as much as 60 percent of South
Africa’s exports, according to government data.  South Africa’s 6.75 percent bonds due 2021 declined for a
fourth day, driving the yield up four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 7.80 percent, the highest on a closing
basis since Jan. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
