Iran ’s Intelligence Ministry urged
domestic security forces and citizens to be leery of “plots”
by enemies in the run-up to the March 2 parliamentary election,
 Fars  reported.  “Based on legitimate information at our disposal, the
enemy is seeking to create turbulence as we advance toward an
election,” Intelligence Minister Heidar Moslehi said, according
to a report today by the state-run  news agency . “This requires
that the security forces and the brave people of the country be
twice as wary.”  Moslehi didn’t provide details. Iranian officials have
referred to Western powers and Israel as enemies amid tension
over  Iran’s nuclear program  and stricter sanctions. Iran says
the program is civilian and designed to generate electricity for
its population, an assertion the U.S. and its allies dispute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
