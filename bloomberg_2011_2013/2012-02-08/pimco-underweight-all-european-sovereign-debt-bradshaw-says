Pacific Investment Management Co.,
manager of the world’s largest bond fund, is underweight all
European sovereign debt, according to Myles Bradshaw, a London-
based executive vice president and  money manager .  Portugal has similar characteristics to Greece, which is an
“insolvent credit,” Bradshaw said at the AFME European Market
Liquidity Conference in  London  today. Spain and Italy can adapt,
though face contagion risks from the debt crisis, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
