Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  must pay
plaintiffs’ legal fees in an evidence-gathering fight with
customers, a judge said after finding the carrier wrongly
withheld 60,000 documents in a lawsuit claiming it colluded with
another airline.  Because there “is no smoking gun” implicating Delta in a
conspiracy with AirTran Holdings Inc. to charge $15 to check the
first bag as alleged in the 2008 suit, paying legal fees and
costs is sufficient, U.S. District Judge Timothy Batten wrote in
an order.  Betsy Talton , a spokeswoman for Atlanta-based Delta, said
the company doesn’t comment on pending litigation. Delta is the
world’s second-largest carrier. AirTran is now a unit of Dallas-
based Southwest Airlines Co.  The withheld documents turned up in a related civil
investigation by the U.S. Justice Department’s antitrust
division.  The case is In re: Delta/ AirTran (LUV)  Baggage Fee Antitrust
Litigation, 1:09-md-02089, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Georgia (Atlanta).  To contact the reporter on this story:
