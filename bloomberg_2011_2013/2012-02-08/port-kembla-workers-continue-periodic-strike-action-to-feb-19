Workers at the Port Kembla Coal
Terminal, operated by companies including  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and
 Xstrata Plc (XTA) , will continue rolling strikes until Feb. 19.  A two-day walk-out started today after an initial week-long
strike finished yesterday, terminal general manager Peter Green
said in a telephone interview. The company is continuing talks
with the Construction, Forestry, Mining, and Energy Union, to
resolve the matter, Green said, without elaborating.  Port Kembla is about 72 kilometers (45 miles) south of
Sydney and is the conduit for coal transported from mines in the
south and west of New South Wales state, according to its
website. The strike will result in an increase in the number of
ships waiting to load cargoes at the harbor, Green said Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
