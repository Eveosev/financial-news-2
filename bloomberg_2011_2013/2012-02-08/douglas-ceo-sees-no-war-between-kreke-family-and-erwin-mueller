Douglas Holding AG  Chief Executive
Officer Henning Kreke said there is “no war” between his
family and shareholder Erwin Mueller as investors jockey for
position ahead of a possible takeover.  Mueller, who acquired options to boost his stake in the
German perfume and makeup retailer in recent weeks, is a
“fierce competitor” for the Kreke family nonetheless, the CEO
said. Kreke doesn’t know what “Mueller is trying to accomplish
by selling put options on Douglas stock,” he told analysts on a
conference call.  Douglas has surged 22 percent this year amid speculation it
could be a takeover target. Kreke last month said the retailer
is in talks with financial investors about a possible stake sale
or acquisition.  The Kreke family continues to have “very good
relationships with the Oetker Group,” the Hagen, Germany-based
company’s biggest shareholder, the CEO said.  Mueller, who owns 10.8 percent of Douglas, has options that
may allow him to acquire an additional 15 percent, the company
said on Feb. 3. The Kreke family has a 12.7 percent stake. Dr.
Oetker Group, a German foodmaker, holds 25.8 percent.  Kreke commented on a conference call today that wasn’t open
to journalists. The company made a recording available to
reporters afterwards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
