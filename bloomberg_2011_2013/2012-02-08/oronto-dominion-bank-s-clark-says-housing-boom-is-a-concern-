Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  Chief Executive
Officer  Edmund Clark  said  Canada ’s banks have a “genuine
concern” about the country’s housing boom and rising debt
levels among consumers.  “Household debt numbers are coming up to U.S. levels, so
that is causing us a concern,” Clark, 64, said today in an
interview on Bloomberg Television.  Canada’s situation is different from what happened in the
U.S. that led to a housing correction, according to Clark.
Canadian  household debt  rose to a record 153 percent of
disposable income in the third quarter of 2011 as borrowing
increased,  Statistics Canada  said Dec. 13. That compares to 146
percent in the U.S.  “There’s nothing going on in Canada like what happened in
the United States because the banks own the mortgages, we put
them on our own balance sheet,” Clark said. “But it doesn’t
mean we couldn’t have a problem where we grew too fast the
 household debt  and housing prices rose.”  The Canadian government prefers that banks “tweak” their
own lending standards rather than it imposing “major
tightening” of mortgage-lending rules, Clark said.  “They’re worried that the Canadian economy is slowing down
right now and that’s taking out a bazooka,” Clark said.  Toronto-Dominion, the country’s second-largest bank, has
raised borrowing costs for higher-risk borrowers while
offsetting that by cutting rates for people with good credit,
Clark said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
