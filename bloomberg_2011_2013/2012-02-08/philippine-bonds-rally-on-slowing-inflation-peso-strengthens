month high and bonds rallied on optimism cooling inflation gives

reducing concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will slow global growth.
Philippine consumer prices rose 3.9 percent in January from a
year earlier, the least in 13 months, official data showed
yesterday.  “Easing inflation gives the central bank room to cut
interest rates and that would be supportive of economic
growth,” said  Enrico Tanuwidjaja , a senior currency analyst at
Malayan Banking Bhd. in Singapore. “The peso’s movements are
also due to global risk appetite.”  The yield on the 6.375 percent debt due January 2022

percent, according to noon fixing prices from the Philippine
Dealing & Exchange Corp.  The peso gained 0.4 percent to 42.220 per dollar in  Manila ,

the three months ending March is possible, Economic Planning

the effects” of faster  government spending  that started in the
fourth quarter of 2011, he said.  Gross domestic product grew 3.7 percent in 2011, compared
