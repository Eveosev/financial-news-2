The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and share prices are as of 3:46 p.m. in  Buenos
Aires .  The  Merval (MERVAL)  Index fell 1.9 percent to 2,716.74.  Stocks fell amid concern that companies may not pay
dividends, Guido Bizzozero, an analyst at brokerage Allaria
Ledesma Cia., said in a telephone interview from Buenos Aires.
“With earnings reports for the fourth quarter coming up, it’s
still in question which companies will be able to distribute
dividends and if they’ll be able to distribute them to foreign
investors,” Bizzozero said.  Grupo Financiero Galicia SA (GGAL)  ,  Argentina ’s largest
consumer lender, fell 4.3 percent to 3.32 pesos.  BBVA Banco
Frances SA (FRAN)  , the local unit of  Spain ’s Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA, plunged 2.6 percent to 9.40 pesos.  Banco
Macro SA (BMA)  (BMA AF), Argentina’s largest lender by market share,
decreased 3.7 percent to 10.40 pesos.  YPF SA (YPFD)  , Argentina’s largest oil company, rose 4.6
percent to 160 pesos. Repsol YPF SA’s Argentine unit estimates
its shale oil resources at the Vaca Muerta formation contain
about 23 billion barrels, according to two people familiar with
the situation. The unit previously announced resources of about
1 billion barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
