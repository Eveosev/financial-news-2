Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  backed
limiting the use of force in Syria without allowing outside
interference in the conflict days after  Russia  and  China  vetoed
a United Nations resolution to end the bloodshed in the country.  “Help them, limit them, for instance, in the ability of
the two sides to use weapons, but don’t interfere under any
circumstances,” Putin said at a meeting with religious leaders
today in Moscow. “We condemn all violence but one can’t behave
like a bull in a china shop.”  After abstaining in last March’s vote that authorized
military action in Libya led by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, Russia last week joined China in vetoing a UN
Security Council resolution drafted by western and Arab
countries to facilitate a handover of power in Syria. Russia
supplies arms to Syria, where it has its only military base
outside the former  Soviet Union .  Putin, who has previously accused western allies of waging
a “crusade” in Libya, said the campaign there has provoked
“frightening crimes” in Sirte, the hometown of late leader
 Muammar Qaddafi .  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad pledged a new constitution
and asked Russia to broker talks with the opposition after talks
yesterday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.  “We undoubtedly have to give the peoples of these
countries a possibility of independently determining their
destiny,” Putin said. “Our task is to help them accomplish
that without any outside interference.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
