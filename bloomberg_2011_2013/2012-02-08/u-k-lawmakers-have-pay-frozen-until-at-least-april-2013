U.K. lawmakers will have their
salaries frozen for another year, the regulator that oversees
their pay and expenses said.  Basic pay will remain at 65,738 pounds ($104,000) a year
until at least April 2013, the Independent Parliamentary
Standards Authority said in an e-mailed statement in  London 
today. The government has frozen the pay of other high-earning
public-sector staff as it tries to cut the U.K.’s budget
deficit.  “We must be mindful of the conditions in the rest of the
public sector where pay has remained static,” IPSA Chair Ian
Kennedy said. “It is right that we act in the interim so that
MPs’ circumstances more closely reflect those experienced by
others.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
