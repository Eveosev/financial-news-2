Japan , the world’s biggest buyer of
liquefied natural gas, may more than double imports of spot LNG
this month from a year earlier, receiving at least seven spot
cargoes, according to ship-tracking data.  The country, which boosted spot purchases after a natural
disaster damaged a nuclear power plant last year, took in three
cargoes in February 2011, according to data from the Japan’s
ministry of finance  website.   LNG Imo may reach the Tobata terminal on Feb. 12, and the
LNG Cross River may reach Japan on Feb. 17, ship transmissions
captured by AISLive on Bloomberg show. The other carriers
heading to Japan are LNG Enugu, British Emerald, LNG River
Orashi, Methane Patricia Camila and Valencia Knutsen, according
to the ship data.  Volumes of spot and short-term cargoes almost tripled to
5.26 million metric tons last year as nuclear outages spurred
overseas purchases, according to the ministry of finance data.
Spot LNG costs on a delivered basis averaged $794 a ton,
equivalent to about $15.26 per million British thermal units,
last year.  U.K. benchmark natural  gas  for next-day delivery, used to
price spot volumes to  Asia , fell to 95 pence a therm today,
equivalent to $15.11 per million Btu, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
