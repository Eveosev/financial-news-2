Drydocks World LLC, the company
controlled by  Dubai World , has no plans to sell its assets in
 Southeast Asia  and is looking for partnerships that will help
bring its business there to profitability by next year,  Albayan 
newspaper reported, citing Chairman Khamis Juma Buamim.  The chairman denied a report yesterday by Dow Jones, which
said the company was considering the sale of its Southeast Asian
ship-building and repair operations as part of a restructuring
of $2.2 billion of debt, citing unidentified bankers.  Drydocks in Southeast Asia has taken steps toward entering
“strategic partnerships” with local and international
companies, Buamim told the newspaper. This will enable it to
increase revenues by 30 percent and cut operating costs by 70
percent next year, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
