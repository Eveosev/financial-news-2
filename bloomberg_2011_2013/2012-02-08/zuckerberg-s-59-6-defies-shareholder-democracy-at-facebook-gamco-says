Facebook Inc.’s governance structure
resembles a dictatorship, requiring investors to surrender
rights to founder  Mark Zuckerberg , according to Gamco Investors
Inc.’s  Larry Haverty .  Zuckerberg, chief executive officer, now controls  56.9
percent  of voting power at Facebook, the company said in a
filing to raise $5 billion in the largest Internet initial
public offering on record. He also has the right to appoint his
own successor, a “disquieting factor,” said Haverty, a
portfolio manager at Rye, New York-based Gamco, in an interview.
Facebook still is a company that a growth-stock investor
“absolutely” wants to own, Haverty said.  “I don’t know whether dictatorship is the right word, but
it more or less defies every vestige of shareholder democracy
known to man,” Haverty said today on “Bloomberg Surveillance”
with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt. “I don’t think it’s how
business should be run.”  Jonathan Thaw, a spokesman for Menlo Park,  California-based
Facebook , declined to comment.  Corporate-governance experts and the California State
Teachers’ Retirement System have acknowledged concerns that the
social-networking company raises corporate-governance issues.  Zuckerberg is running the company “as an adult, even
though I’m not comfortable with the governance,” Haverty said.  Gamco isn’t an investor in Facebook. The  money manager  may
wait for Facebook to have “some sort of an accident” before it
buys shares because the stock will be expensive after its IPO,
Haverty said in an interview on Jan. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
