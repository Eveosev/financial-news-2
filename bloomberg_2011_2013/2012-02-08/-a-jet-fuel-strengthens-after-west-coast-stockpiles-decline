Los Angeles jet fuel rose to the
highest level since January after regional inventories of the
fuel dropped.  The premium for jet fuel versus heating oil futures traded
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  rose 0.13 cent to 2.63 cents
a gallon at 4:04 p.m., the highest differential since Jan. 27,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery slipped
0.01 cent to $3.2158 a gallon.  Jet fuel supplies dropped 582,000 barrels, or 5.7 percent,
to 9.6 million barrels on the West Coast last week, according to
the Energy Department. Itâ€™s the lowest level since the week
ending Dec. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
