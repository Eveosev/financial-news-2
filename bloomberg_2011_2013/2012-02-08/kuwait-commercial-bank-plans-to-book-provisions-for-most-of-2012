Commercial Bank of Kuwait SAK  plans
to continue booking provisions in the first three quarters of
2012 as the process of “cleaning up balance sheets” takes
longer than expected, the acting chief executive officer said.  Regional and international “economic situations didn’t
look that bad a year ago,” Elham Mahfouz said in a phone
interview in  Kuwait City  yesterday, citing popular unrests in
the Middle East and North Africa region and the debt crisis in
 Europe . The bank set aside 101.3 million dinars ($366 million)
as provisions against loans and investment portfolios.  Lending is expected to grow by less than 5 percent this
year and the bank foresees a “slight” increase in profit,
Mahfouz said. Profit plunged to 810,000 dinars last year from
40.5 million dinars in 2010, the bank said on Feb. 5.  “We are hoping delayed mega projects in  Kuwait ’s water and
electricity sectors see the light soon,” Mahfouz said,
referring to Kuwait’s 30.8 billion-dinar development plan
seeking to modernize and restructure the country’s oil-dependent
economy. “This will get the economy wheel rotating, which will
positively benefit everyone, including us.”  The shares  dropped 2.7 percent to 710 fils at 1 p.m. in
Kuwait. The stock has lost 10 percent this year compared with a
0.4 percent gain for the  benchmark KSE Index.   To contact the reporter on this story:
