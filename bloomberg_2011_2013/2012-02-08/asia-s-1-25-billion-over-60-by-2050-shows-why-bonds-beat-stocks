With  Asia ’s elderly population poised
to double within four decades, more money is being plowed into
preserving wealth than enhancing growth, driving up demand for
the region’s bonds that are beating returns on stocks.  The number of Asians 60 or older will exceed 1.25 billion,
or 24 percent of the population in 2050 from 10 percent in 2011,
according to data compiled by the  United Nations . That helps
explain the surge in pension fund assets and shows why the
region’s emerging-market debt returned 63 percent in the five
years through 2011, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co.  index .
The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares excluding  Japan  gained 17
percent in that period.  While the bond rally drove down sovereign  yields , it is
also forcing insurers to seek higher returns in riskier debt
across Asia, according to  Cathay Life Insurance Co. (2805) , Taiwan’s
largest, and  Singapore ’s NTUC Income Cooperative Ltd. The
elderly typically reduce risk to retirement savings by limiting
holdings of equities needed to help fund Asia’s economic growth.  “The graying population will matter,” said Thiam Wooi Lye, a senior manager who helps manage $20 billion at NTUC,
Singapore’s third-largest insurer. “The returns on equity won’t
compensate for the liabilities from pensioners. They will
increase allocations to bonds.”  Pension Assets Triple  Pension-fund assets in South Korea will almost triple to
1,919 trillion won ($1.7 trillion) by 2020 from 2011’s 746
trillion won, according to Son Seong Dong, the head of a Seoul-
based pension research body established by Mirae Asset Financial
Group, which controls  South Korea ’s biggest mutual fund with $55
billion in assets.  Investors over 50 prefer bonds’ fixed payments, as
“prudence trumps desire,” Singapore-based Volatility Research
& Trading Ltd. wrote in a Jan. 15 report. In South Korea, there
are now 1.2 people aged over 50 for every person between 35 and
49, the part of the population that favors stocks, the company
said. The ratio will climb to 3.6 by 2046.  Taiwan will have 413 people aged over 65 for every 100
under 15 by 2050, compared with Japan’s 339, according to the
 Council for Economic Planning and Development  in Taipei. About
38 percent of Singapore’s population will be older than 60 by
2050, up from 12 percent in 2005, UN data show. After expanding
2.5 percent a year for the past three decades,  China ’s working-
age population has stopped growing and will contract 1 percent a
year by the mid-2020s, according to the  Center for Strategic and
International Studies  in  Washington .  ‘A Big Problem’  “In five to 10 years there’ll be a big problem,” said
Ethan Huang, who helps oversee NT$200 billion ($68 billion) as a
fixed-income portfolio manager at Cathay Life in Taipei. “The
birth rate is dropping really fast. It’ll hurt local consumption
and eventually economic growth.”  Japan’s shrinking labor force has triggered two decades of
slowing growth and falling stock prices, Ajay Kapur, Deutsche
Bank AG’s head of Asian equity strategy in  Hong Kong , wrote in a
Jan. 6 report.  While investors lost money in equities and gained with
 government bonds , returns shrank as  interest rates  slumped. The
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average  is almost 80 percent below the record
close of 38,915.87 on Dec. 29, 1989. The yield on Japan’s
benchmark 10-year note fell to 0.99 percent, from 5.73 percent
in the same time. Investors in government debt earned 90 percent
during the 1990s and 20 percent in the following decade.  Slowing Economies  Taiwan ’s expansion may slow to 3.5 percent per year this
decade, from 5.1 percent in the 20 years through 2010, according
to Singapore-based DBS Group Holdings Ltd. Developing Asian
nations will see growth of 7.8 percent this year after 8.2
percent in 2011 and 9.7 percent in 2010, the  World Bank  forecast
last month.  Cathay Life is interested in government debt from South
Korea,  Thailand  and  Indonesia  as well as yuan notes sold in Hong
Kong, known as Dim Sum debt, said Huang. Taiwanese insurers are
also buying bonds rated BB by  Standard & Poor’s , the highest
junk ratings, after limiting holdings to those rated A, four
levels higher, he said.  Yields on  Taiwan’s (GVTW10YR)  10-year government bonds have fallen to
1.29 percent from 4 percent a decade ago, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Singapore’s (MASB10Y)  slid to 1.53 percent from
around 4 percent and  Indonesia’s (GIDN10YR)  dropped to 5.14 percent from
11.5 percent.  More Pensions  Climbing pension assets have caused the gap between
corporate and government yields to narrow, making it harder for
fund managers to deliver returns, Mirae’s Son said.  “Society is aging at a surprisingly rapid pace,” he said.
“With too much money chasing limited pools of assets, domestic
bond yields have come down quite fast. It’s a big challenge for
fund managers to find investments with safety and reasonable
returns.”  Five-year Korean corporate bonds with the lowest investment
grade of BBB-  yield  654 basis points, or 6.54 percentage points,
more than similar-maturity government securities, down from 7
percentage points a year ago.  “A large percentage of Korean pensions promise investors a
fixed return and, with sovereign yields at record lows, it has
become a major task for us to find higher-yielding yet low-risk
assets,” said Kim Hee Seok, Seoul-based chief investment
officer of Korea Life Insurance Co., the nation’s second-
biggest, with $59 billion in assets. “Insurance firms will be
buying bonds whenever yields climb.”  BRIC Slowdown  Asia isn’t alone. Labor pools are also poised to shrink in
Brazil, Russia, India and China, known as BRICs, causing global
growth to peak at about 4.3 percent this decade and fall to 3.9
percent in the 2020s, according to a Dec. 7 report by  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)   Goldman Sachs Asset Management Chairman Jim O’Neill, who
coined the BRIC acronym a decade ago, said in a December
interview from  London  that he favored developing economies with
“large young populations,” including Indonesia,  Turkey ,  Egypt 
and  Mexico .  Bonds also beat stocks for reasons besides changing age
patterns. The worst financial meltdown since the Great
Depression and  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis have driven
investors to the relative safety of fixed income. Companies
raised $442.5 billion in equity sales last year, down 29 percent
from 2010, Bloomberg data show.  Active Trading  Increased pension assets will make the region’s bond
markets more actively traded and so less risky, according to
Iwan Azis, the Manila-based head of Office of Regional Economic
Integration at Asian Development Bank.  Outstanding debt in East Asia’s emerging markets increased
5.5 percent to $5.5 trillion as of Sept. 30 from a year earlier,
the ADB estimates. The asset-management industry in Asia outside
Japan may double to $4 trillion by 2015, from $2.2 trillion in
2011, according to a survey of fund managers by Cerulli
Associates in Singapore.  “The demographic change will add depth and liquidity to
Asian bond markets,” increasing investment in corporate bonds,
he said.  Asian life insurers “drove” demand last month when
Beijing-based China Development Bank Corp. sold 1.5 billion yuan
($238 million) of 15-year debt in Hong Kong, the longest
maturity for a Dim Sum note so far, said Ken Wei Wong, director
of debt syndication at Barclays Plc in Singapore. Korea’s
government said last month it plans to sell its first 30-year
debt this year to satisfy demand from pension funds.  “Bond markets in Asia have become more vibrant since the
crisis,” said NTUC’s Lye, who is targeting debt in Indonesia,
Malaysia and China. “The graying population will be looking for
yields and returns.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
