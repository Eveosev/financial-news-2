Treasury 10-year note  yields  reached
2 percent for the first time in two weeks as the U.S. sold $24
billion of the securities.  Treasuries fluctuated as Greek officials worked to
negotiate terms to unlock a 130 billion euro ($172.5 billion)
rescue package. U.S. 30-year bond yields were little changed
before tomorrow’s auction of $16 billion of the securities,
completing $72 billion of note and bond sales this week.  “The auction went well, but the participation numbers were
pretty average, so you can’t get too excited,” said  Suvrat Prakash , an interest-rate strategist in New York at BNP Paribas
Securities Corp., one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the
Federal Reserve. “The U.S. market is being held captive to
headlines out of  Europe  and that isn’t going to change any time
soon.”  The  yield  on the current 10-year note was little changed at
1.98 percent at 5 p.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. The 2 percent securities maturing in November
2021 traded at 100 5/32. The yield touched 2 percent for the
first time since Jan. 25.  Thirty-year bond  yields were little changed at 3.15 percent
after reaching as much as 3.18 percent.  Bid Details  The 10-year notes sold today drew a  yield  of 2.02 percent,
compared with a forecast of 2.025 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of nine of the Fed Reserve’s primary dealers. The  bid-to-
cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with
the amount of debt offered, was 3.05, the lowest since November.
It was the second of three note and bond auctions totaling $72
billion this week.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 38.9 percent of the notes at the
offering, compared with the average for the past 10 offerings of
44.3 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 17.9 percent of
the notes at the last sale, versus an average of 12 percent for
the past 10 auctions.  The government is due to auction 30-year debt tomorrow
after a $32 billion three-year note sale yesterday where primary
dealers bought 63.8 percent of the offering, the largest
proportion since January 2009. The three offerings will raise
$22.4 billion of new cash, with maturing securities totaling
$49.6 billion.  Risk Returns  Investors should hold stocks instead of bonds, according to
Laurence D. Fink, chief executive officer of BlackRock Inc., the
world’s largest money manager.  “You need to take on more risk,” Fink said on Bloomberg
Television’s “First Up” with Susan Li in  Hong Kong . Treasuries
will have minimal returns with the Fed keeping  interest rates 
low, he said. New York-based BlackRock oversees $3.51 trillion.  The U.S. central bank announced Jan. 25 that it will hold
its target for overnight bank lending at virtually zero until at
least late 2014. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said policy makers
were considering buying bonds to sustain the expansion.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s government is readying
plans for parliamentary votes on a bailout for  Greece  as soon as
next week while Greek political leaders struggle for consensus
on terms of the aid, the deputy floor leader of Merkel’s party
said.  Greek Talks  Greece’s Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  is set to negotiate
with leaders of the political parties supporting his caretaker
government after he missed another deadline to secure a second
aid package.  “The Greek story is still driving the market, and delays
here and delays there just continue to add uncertainty, which is
supporting Treasuries,” said  Sean Murphy , a Treasury trader at
Societe Generale SA in New York, one of the 21 primary dealers
that trade with the  Federal Reserve . “We should continue to
hold the recent range as long as the uncertainty remains, which
means the auction should go fine.”  The central bank is replacing $400 billion of shorter-
maturity Treasuries in its holdings with longer-term debt to cap
borrowing costs and spur the economy under a program it plans to
conclude in June.  The Fed bought $1.8 billion of bonds due from February 2036
to May 2041 today, according to the New York Fed’s  website . It
also sold $8.6 billion of Treasuries maturing from June to
November 2013.  The difference in yields between 10-year TIPS and 10-year
Treasury notes, known as the break-even rate, which represents
traders’ expectations for inflation over the life of the
securities was 2.20 percentage points. The CPI is forecast to
rise 2.1 percent this year, down from 3.2 percent in 2011,
according to the median estimate of 66 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
