Agricultural Bank of Greece SA  may
transfer around 7 billion euros ($9.29 billion) of troubled
assets to a new company to avoid a recapitalization following a
write down of Greek government debt, Imerisia  said .  The new asset management company would be controlled and
guaranteed by the state and would operate for around 10 years,
the Athens-based newspaper said, citing a bank document.  The move, to be proposed after an agreement on a Greek debt
swap, would allow the lender to have good asset quality and to
become the healthiest Greek bank with no recapitalization needs,
seen by the bank at 2.5 billion euros for covering the impact of
the debt swap, Imerisia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
