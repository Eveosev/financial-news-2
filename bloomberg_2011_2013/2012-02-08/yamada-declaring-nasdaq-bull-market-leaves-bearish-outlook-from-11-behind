The  Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP)  has
entered a  bull market  and stocks may continue to rally through
the end of March, according to  Louise Yamada , who said in
December that equity charts were signaling further losses.  “The Nasdaq has initiated a new structural bull market,”
Yamada, managing director of Louise Yamada Technical Research
Advisors LLC in New York, said in a radio interview today on
“Bloomberg on the Economy” with Sara Eisen. “We’ve entered
the year with short-term positive signals with the possibility
that we could see a rally through the first quarter.”  Yamada, who worked as a technical analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney, said in a December report that investors may be better
off selling “weaker stocks into strength” after a 14 percent
gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index since October. She said
in November that evidence the market’s advance will continue
hadn’t materialized and the year-end rally may falter. The
benchmark measure for U.S. equities has gained 7.3 percent this
year for the best annual start since 1991.  The  Nasdaq  Composite reached 2,918.26 today, its strongest
intraday level since December 2000. The gauge peaked at a six-
year closing high of 2,859.12 in 2007 before plunging 56 percent
through March 2009. The Nasdaq surpassed its 2007 level on eight
days last year, fell below it in July, only to surpass 2,859.12
again on Feb. 2. The rebound still leaves the measure 42 percent
below its record high of 5,048.62 in March 2000.  ‘Extremely Intriguing’  “One thing that’s extremely intriguing to us is that the
Nasdaq has not only gone through the 2011 peak but has also now
exceeded the 2007 peak for the second time,” Yamada said. “The
bigger the drop, the longer the need for repair. Well, we have
that incredible 2000 drop and now you’ve had eight years of
repair.”  Investors should buy the  PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ)  to profit
from the Nasdaq’s likely rally, as well as gains from  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) , she said. Apple, the world’s largest company by market
value, makes up 16 percent of the Nasdaq-100 Index, which serves
as the basis for the PowerShares fund.  The Nasdaq Composite Index, which gets 53 percent of its
value from technology companies, has risen 12 percent in 2012 as
S&P 500 computer and software makers  beat  fourth-quarter
earnings estimates by 12 percent, more than any other industry.
The Nasdaq is up 24 percent since its 2011 low on Oct. 3.  Fed Helps  The  Federal Reserve ’s plans to keep  interest rates  low
through at least late 2014 will probably help equities,
according to Yamada. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average , which has
also exceeded its 2011 high, has reversed the long-term sell
signal it had last year, while the  S&P 500  and the Nasdaq
Composite are close, she said. Most of the global equity indexes
still hold long-term sell signals, Yamada said.  The MSCI All-Country World Index of shares in 45 nations
has surged 20 percent since Oct. 4, ending a  bear market  that
began in May.  “The Fed came in guaranteeing liquidity and we know
whenever that happens we’ve seen some follow-through on the
equity advance,” Yamada said. “The question here is have we
started a new cyclical advance, which is the case perhaps for
many of the global markets, or do we have an aging bull?”  To contact the reporters on this story:
