Commissioner Andris Piebalgs said he will seek more funds to
promote access to modern energy technologies in poor nations.  He made the comments during an event at the European
Parliament in Brussels to mark the launch of the  United Nations ’
initiative on “Sustainable Energy for All.”  On the EU’s initiatives:  “The European Commission alone has spent an average of 315
million euros ($417.3 million) a year over the last seven years
- that’s about 2 billion euros in all - to enhance the state of
the energy sector in  developing countries . And the  European
Investment Bank  has been prioritizing energy, resulting in
billions of euro being granted in preferential loans in recent
years.”  “Moreover, the commission has developed instruments like
the ACP-EU Energy Facility, aimed specifically at increasing
access to modern energy services in rural and peri-urban areas,
focusing on renewable and energy-efficient technologies. The
Energy Facility has provided funding of 300 million euro since
2005.”  “To further support “Sustainable Energy for All”, I
intend to drive funding levels upwards. I envisage that the
commission could make significant additional funds available for
energy actions in the years ahead. This would have to be done
with the full involvement of the private sector and with every
effort made to leverage funding with loans from development
banks and investments from other private sources. Indeed, we
will look to make greater use of innovative financial tools in
the future.”
