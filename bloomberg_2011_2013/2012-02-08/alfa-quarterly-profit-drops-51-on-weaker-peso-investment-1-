Alfa SAB (ALFAA) , the world’s largest
producer of aluminum engine heads, said fourth-quarter profit
declined 51 percent on a weaker Mexican peso and costs to expand
its auto-parts business.  Net income fell to 1.1 billion pesos ($87.5 million) from
2.3 billion pesos a year earlier, the San Pedro Garza Garcia,
Mexico-based company said in a  filing  today to the nation’s
stock exchange. Sales rose 33 percent to 48.3 billion pesos.  Alfa, which got 55 percent of its revenue  outside of Mexico 
in 2010, was affected as the peso weakened last year and fell
11 percent against the dollar. The company also said it invested
$197 million to boost auto-parts production. Alfa’s other
businesses include petrochemicals, processed foods and
telecommunications.  The company attributed its revenue increase to “organic
growth, improvements in operations and acquisitions in the
petrochemical business.” Chief Executive Officer Alvaro Fernandez said in the filing that “we continue serving high-
demand markets and we are developing the new business of natural
gas and hydrocarbons.”  Alfa rose 1.6 percent to 173.89 pesos at 1:52 p.m. in
Mexico City. The  shares  gained 13 percent this year through
yesterday.  The company made acquisitions valued at least $1.36 billion
since September 2010 in  South Carolina ,  Arizona  and  Mississippi 
to expand production of plastics and processed meat.  The Alpek SA petrochemical and fiber unit is expanding
through acquisitions to take advantage of demand for materials
such as polyethylene terephthalate, known as PET and used in
plastic bottles. Alfa last year bought three plants from Eastman
Chemical Co. and one from Wellman Inc. to boost production.  Alpek may offer shares to the public in Mexico and abroad,
according to a Jan. 13 filing with the Mexican stock exchange.  Net debt was $3.6 billion at the end of the fourth quarter,
rising from 27 percent from the end of 2010, and was 2.1 times
cash flow, Alfa said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
