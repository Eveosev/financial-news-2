France  will have to step up efforts
to reduce its budget and trade deficits after the April-May
presidential election or risk a debt spiral, the national
auditor said today in a report.  Europe ’s second-largest economy had a record trade
shortfall of 69.6 billion euros ($92 billion) last year,
equivalent to about 3.5 percent of gross domestic product.
Government spending exceeded revenue by about 5.4 percent in
2011, President  Nicolas Sarkozy  has estimated.  The figures show little room for fiscal maneuver will exist
for Sarkozy or his successor as investors scrutinize accounts in
light of Europe’s debt crisis. France, which was stripped of its
AAA credit rating by Standard & Poor’s Jan. 13, must step up
spending cuts to meet its deficit targets and keep the debt
burden at less than 90 percent of GDP, the auditor said.  “It’s essential to prevent the markets from sensing any
risk of France’s debt being unsustainable,” the auditor said
today in a 1,073-page report. “The snowball effect would ensure
that debt would quickly become uncontrollable.”  The auditor estimates that France had a “structural”
 budget deficit  of 5 percent of GDP in 2010 and the government
trimmed it by between 0.4 percentage point and 0.7 percentage
point of GDP in 2011, the biggest such reduction since 1994. The
2012 budget contains a reduction of another 1.25 points.  Reducing Shortfall  To meet its target of cutting the  total budget deficit  to 3
percent of GDP in 2013 and eliminating it by 2016, France must
reduce the shortfall by 1.4 percentage points next year and 0.9
percentage point in each of the following three years, according
to the report.  The tightening planned for this year “has only been
exceeded twice in the past 20 years,” the auditor said. “It
presumes a slowdown in spending that has not quite been
achieved” and suggests that “more than half the work remains
to be done.”  The auditor recommends the government focus on cutting
spending rather than raising taxes. After increasing at a median
of 2.2 percent a year through the last decade, growth in
spending slowed to 1.4 percent in 2011 and will have to slow to
0.5 percent in 2013 and 2014, the auditor said.  Government
spending  amounts to 56.3 percent of GDP.  France “will only be able to recover its credibility by
setting out precise additional measures to meet its
objectives,” the auditor said. “To bolster growth potential,
taxes and social charges must also be shifted to improve the
competitiveness of companies. In effect, it’s the twin deficits
that need to be confronted.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
