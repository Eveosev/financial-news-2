U.S. stocks  erased  early gains, a day
after the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  closed at the highest
level since 2008, amid concern that Greek Prime Minister  Lucas
Papademos  and coalition party members would fail to agree on
terms required for a bailout.  The  Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index  slipped 0.1 percent to
1,345.22 at 11:08 a.m. New York time after climbing as much as
0.3 percent. The Dow slumped 34.97 points, or 0.3 percent, to
12,843.23. Equities dropped as the euro weakened 0.2 percent to
$1.3232 after the European currency reached the highest intraday
level since Dec. 12 versus the U.S. dollar yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
