Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the biggest
seller of gasoline-electric autos, wants to spur U.S. demand for
its hybrids with a smaller, cheaper version of the Prius, a goal
that eluded  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  with its Insight.  Toyota wants to sell as many as 40,000 units this year of
the subcompact Prius c that goes on sale in March,  Bob Carter ,
group vice president for U.S. sales, said in an interview. That
would be double the best annual sales Tokyo-based Honda has had
in the U.S. for its low-priced Insight hybrid.  “It’s going to appeal to a younger buyer at a price that’s
more affordable,” Carter said Jan. 31 in  La Jolla ,  California .
“It will add substantial incremental sales to Prius this
year.”  Toyota, based in Toyota City, Japan, is targeting a U.S.
sales gain of more than 15 percent this year to 1.9 million
Toyota, Lexus and Scion vehicles, and a 21 percent rise in
global deliveries to 9.58 million autos. The U.S. increase will
come from increased sales of all Prius models, Camry sedans and
gains for Lexus luxury models,  Jim Lentz , head of sales for the
region, said in an interview in  Las Vegas  this week.  Toyota,  Asia ’s largest automaker, has a U.S. goal of
selling at least 220,000 units of the four-model Prius line this
year, comprised of the main Prius, the Prius c, Prius v wagon
and a plug-in version of the hatchback that can go 15 miles
solely on battery power before running as a conventional hybrid.  “Selling 40,000 looks a bit challenging, but it’s
possible,” said Jessica Caldwell, an auto sales analyst for
Edmunds.com in  Santa Monica , California. “The average fuel-
economy point of over 50 mpg city is going to be very attractive
to a lot of people.”  Shorter, Lighter Prius  The base Prius c, which includes hands-free Bluetooth phone
controls, is priced at $18,950. A grade “Three” version of the
car for $21,635 adds navigation and a higher-end audio system.
Top-end grade “Four” is $23,230, and includes heated front
seats and alloy wheels. A regular Prius starts at $24,000 and
rises to $29,805, according to Toyota.  Prius c is 19 inches shorter, 1 inch lower and 542 pounds
lighter than a standard Prius, Toyota said.  The small 5-door hatchback may be rated by the U.S. as
getting 53 miles per gallon of gasoline in city driving, 46 mpg
highway and 50 mpg combined, the company said.  Honda’s compact Insight, Prius c’s closest competitor,
starts at $18,350 and averages 42 mpg. The company, the second-
biggest seller of hybrids, initially planned to sell at least
90,000 Insights in the U.S. annually when the car went on sale
in 2009. Its best year so far was 2010, when Honda sold 20,962.  ‘No Shame’  Since Prius has achieved a certain “cachet” that eludes
most economy-minded cars, that helps Prius c, Caldwell said.  “There’s no shame associated with driving one,” she said.
“They’re targeting young singles and couples, but it’s probably
also going to attract a lot of  baby boomers  who want a very
fuel-efficient, affordable car.”  U.S. hybrid sales have fluctuated with gasoline prices,
rising when pump prices soared and falling as fuel becomes more
affordable. Sales of such vehicles dropped last year to just 2.2
percent of industrywide U.S. auto sales, from 2.4 percent in
2010, according to researcher LMC Automotive.  That was mainly due to a plunge in Prius inventory after
last year’s earthquake and tsunami in  Japan  cut production,
Lentz said in a January interview.  Honda’s Insight went on sale in 2009 as gasoline prices
tumbled, as the recession cut demand. Toyota’s timing may be
better. Regular grade gasoline cost an average of $3.48 a gallon
on Feb. 7, according AAA’s Daily Fuel Gauge Report. That’s up
10.9 cents from a month ago, and 35.8 cents from a year ago.  Fuel Prices  Prices may be going higher.  The U.S. Energy Department 
yesterday increased its crude-oil price projection for 2012 to
 $100.40 a barrel  this year from $100.25 a barrel in January.  “On the strength of the Prius name, the car is going to
bring in interested buyers, but fuel prices are going to have to
keep rising for the company to reach its target,” said Alan Baum, principal of Baum & Associates, a provider of automobile-
industry analysis in West Bloomfield,  Michigan .  Toyota’s U.S. sales unit is based in Torrance, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
