India ’s rupee strengthened for the
first time in three days on speculation Greece is making
progress in its efforts to secure more international aid,
boosting demand for emerging-market assets.  Overseas funds boosted holdings of Indian shares by $227
million on Feb. 6, exchange data show. Greek Prime Minister
 Lucas Papademos  will meet the heads of three political parties
today to negotiate terms for a 130 billion-euro ($172 billion)
rescue package. The nation’s government officials held
“constructive” talks with private bondholders yesterday,
according to a statement from the International Institute of
Finance.  “This isn’t a full out risk-on rally yet,” said  Vishnu Varathan , an economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in
Singapore. “The markets are getting weary of the negotiations
and seem to have priced in the fact that  Greece  will reach some
sort of deal.”  The rupee advanced 0.1 percent to 49.15 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Three-month onshore forwards traded at 50.16 a dollar,
compared with 50.19 yesterday. Offshore non-deliverable forwards
traded at 50.13 from 49.92. Forwards are agreements to buy or
sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts
are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
