California (STOCA1)  should calculate business
taxes solely on in-state sales as a way to generate as much as
$1 billion a year and use the money to subsidize college tuition
for middle-class students, legislative Democrats say.  The plan by Assembly Speaker John Perez of  Los Angeles 
would no longer allow companies to choose a formula that
provides favorable tax treatment for businesses with property
and payroll outside the state. Instead, multi-state businesses
would calculate their California income tax based on the
percentage of their sales in the state.  California’s constitution requires bills that increase
taxes to win the approval of two-thirds of the Legislature. A
similar proposal last year by Governor  Jerry Brown  failed to get
enough Republican votes to assemble the so-called supermajority.
Brown’s plan earmarked the revenue for tax relief to small
businesses, manufacturers and individuals.  Perez said almost 200,000 students would be eligible for
the subsidy, reducing college costs by as much as $33,000 over
four years for some.  University of California  fees have
increased 145 percent since 2004 as the state has reduced
support for the system amid budget deficits.  Under current law, some California companies can choose
between a formula that bases 50 percent of their taxes on
California sales, while the remaining half is split between in-
state property and total sales, according to a Finance
Department fact sheet. Those businesses can opt instead to base
their payments solely on sales.  To contact the reporters on this story:
