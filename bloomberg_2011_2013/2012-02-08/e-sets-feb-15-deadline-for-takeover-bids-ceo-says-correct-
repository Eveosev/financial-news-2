The London Metal Exchange set Feb. 15
as a deadline for takeover bids that will be reviewed by a
special committee, Chief Executive Officer  Martin Abbott  said.  The committee made up of Abbott and three other directors
of LME Holdings Ltd. will look at the bids for the 135-year-old
exchange before the board of 12 directors meets on Feb. 23,
Abbott said in an interview in London today. The directors are
Brian Bender, LME chairman, Nat Le Roux, non executive chairman
of  IG Group Holdings Plc (IGG)  and David Rough, deputy chairman of
 Xstrata Plc. (XTA)  No bids have arrived, Abbott said.  “We wait for the bids to come back on the deadline next
week,” he said at the LME office. “There is no advantage to
anybody sending it early. I would expect that we’ll get them all
on deadline.”  The LME, owned by its members, handled $15.4 trillion of
contracts last year. It sent memorandums of information to
potential buyers last month after saying in September it got
more than 10 “expressions of interest.” The exchange is being
advised by Moelis & Co., a U.S. investment bank.  “The shareholders will take the final decision,” Abbott
said. The board will decide whether to recommend the bid to
shareholders, with 75 percent support needed for a bid to
succeed, Abbott said in September. The bid committee is
“responsible for making sure we understand all the
detail, together with the bankers, and can report to the
board,” Abbott said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
