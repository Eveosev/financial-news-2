Faurecia SA ,  Europe ’s largest maker
of car interiors, said 2011 profit climbed 84 percent, beating
analyst estimates, as sales in  North America  rose.  Net income gained to 371 million euros ($492 million) from
202 million euros a year earlier, Nanterre, France-based
Faurecia said in an e-mailed statement today. Analysts had
expected net income of 344 million euros, according to the
average of 10 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 17
percent to 16.2 billion euros.  “All business groups have grown very solidly,” Chief
Financial Officer Frank Imbert said in a conference call with
analysts. “We had a very strong performance in North America.”  Faurecia, which is 57 percent owned by  PSA Peugeot Citroen ,
is targeting annual revenue of 20 billion euros by 2015, a goal
the company said today it expects to meet. The company will
combine cost-savings from acquisitions, such as U.S. catalytic-
converter manufacturer Emcon, with expansion in  China  to meet
the target.  Operating income may fall this year, as European car
production falls between 4 percent and 6 percent,  Faurecia (EO)  said.
The projection of 610 million euros and 670 million euros
compares with 2011’s operating income of 651 million euros.  Sales in North America increased 33 percent last year to
2.6 billion euros, while European revenue gained 6 percent to
7.8 billion euros. Emissions control technologies was the
fastest growing segment, climbing 21 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
