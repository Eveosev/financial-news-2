Latvian consumer prices grew at the
slowest pace in 13 months in January as communications and
health costs fell.  The inflation rate dropped to 3.6 percent from 4 percent
the previous month, the  statistics office  in the capital, Riga,
said today on its website. That matched the median estimate of
five economists in a Bloomberg  survey.  Consumer prices rose 0.8
percent from December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
