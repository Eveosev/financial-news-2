Suzlon Energy Ltd. ,  India ’s biggest
wind-turbine maker, may build a plant to make equipment for
turbines in South Africa, where it is seeking to expand.  The company is studying potential sites in the Eastern Cape
and Western Cape, Silas Zimu, chief executive officer of
Suzlon’s South African business, said in an interview by phone
from Johannesburg. A team will evaluate the sites next week, he
said, without disclosing the investment amount for the plant.  The company plans to make towers and blades for  wind
turbines  in South Africa, he said. The manufacturing plant would
need to produce about 400 megawatts worth of equipment a year to
justify the investment, Zimu said yesterday.  South Africa  is trying to reduce reliance on fossil fuels
while expanding power capacity. Most of its electricity is
generated from coal by state-owned Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd.,
which said in November the gap between electricity supply and
demand is “tight.”  The country on Aug. 3 issued a request for proposals by
companies interested in building renewable energy plants with a
combined capacity of 3,725 megawatts by the end of 2016. Suzlon
was included in the preferred bidders appointed in December, for
its proposed 135-megawatt Cookhouse wind farm.  Suzlon, based in Pune, India, hopes to get a power-purchase
agreement for the wind project in March or April, Zimu said.
That will allow for work at the project to start.  Suzlon in May signed a contract with African Clean Energy
Developments Pty. to supply and construct the turbines.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
