Oil rose for a third day in  New York 
after Greek politicians were said to have reached a deal on
austerity measures and a U.S. report showed initial jobless
claims unexpectedly declined last week.  Crude advanced as much as 1.2 percent. The leaders of
Greece’s main political parties reached an agreement on
austerity measures needed to secure a second international
rescue program, European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi 
said. U.S. applications for jobless benefits fell by 15,000 to
358,000, Labor Department figures showed today. Economists
forecast 370,000 claims, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey.  “The risk of falling down to deep recession is starting to
decrease,” said Thina Saltvedt, an analyst at Nordea Bank AB in
Oslo. “The news about  Greece  together with more positive signs
on the  U.S. economy  has boosted the outlook for oil demand.”  Oil for March delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
rose as much as $1.19 to $99.90 a barrel and was at $99.64 at
2:04 p.m.  London  time. Brent oil for March settlement rose for
an eighth day on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London,
gaining $1.01 to $118.21. The European benchmark’s premium to
the New York-traded West Texas Intermediate grade widened to
$18.57 from $18.48 yesterday. The spread reached a record $27.88
on Oct. 14.  OPEC Report  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its
forecast for global oil demand in 2012 as the economic recovery
struggles to gain momentum.  The group’s Vienna-based secretariat reduced its estimate
of consumption for this year by 120,000 barrels a day, to 88.76
million a day, in its monthly market report today. OPEC’s output
rose to the highest in more than three years in January as
 Libya ,  Kuwait  and  Iraq  boosted production, and is exceeding
demand by almost 5 percent, data from the report show.  Oil may extend its rally in New York as futures approach a
“golden cross” formation on the daily technical chart,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 100-day moving
average, at $94.43 a barrel today, has pared a discount to the
200-day mean to 24 cents, the smallest since mid-September.
Investors tend to buy contracts when a shorter-term moving
average rises above a longer-term one.  Stockpile Report  U.S. refineries operated at 83 percent of capacity, up 1
percentage point from the previous week, according to an Energy
Department report yesterday.  Crude  inventories  rose by 304,000 barrels to 339.2 million
in the week ended Feb. 3, according to the report. A median gain
of 2.5 million barrel was forecast by analysts in a Bloomberg
News survey. Imports fell 5.3 percent.  Gasoline surged to the highest price in more than five
months on speculation refinery shutdowns in  Europe  and the U.S.
will trigger a supply crunch. Gasoline for March delivery in New
York climbed 0.4 percent to $2.9870 a gallon today. It rose 4.77
cents to $2.9752 a gallon yesterday, the highest settlement
since Aug. 31.  Imports of the motor fuel dropped 32 percent last week, the
Energy Department said. Stockpiles rose 1.6 million barrels,
more than a  projected  875,000 barrel gain. Distillate-fuel
inventories, including heating oil and diesel, increased 1.2
million barrels, compared with a forecast for supplies to
decline 875,000 barrels.  To contact the reporters on this story:
