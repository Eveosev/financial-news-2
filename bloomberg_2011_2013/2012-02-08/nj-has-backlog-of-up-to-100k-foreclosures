New Jersey  must work through a
backlog of 50,000 to 100,000 unprocessed foreclosures because of
delays caused by an investigation into how lenders handled the
filings, said Richard Constable, acting commissioner of the
state Community Affairs Department.  Foreclosures slowed to about 10,000 last year from 50,000
in 2010 and 150,000 two years ago after claims of “robo-
signing” -- unverified documents sped through the system --
spurred an investigation by state attorneys general at the end
of 2010, Constable said today at a meeting of mayors in the
Statehouse in Trenton.  As many as 100,000 properties will soon come to market in
New Jersey as banks resume processing foreclosure sales,
Constable said. The state will work with towns to make sure that
the foreclosures don’t blight neighborhoods, he said.  New Jersey has the second-highest inventory of homes in
foreclosure after  Florida , with 6.4 percent of all dwellings
with a mortgage in the process, according to data released today
by CoreLogic Inc., a  Santa Ana , California-based data real
estate information company. Nationally, 1.4 million homes, or
3.4 percent of those with a mortgage, were in foreclosure as of
December.  New Jersey also had the second-longest average foreclosure
process, at 964 days in the fourth quarter, after  New York ,
where properties took an average of 1,019 days to complete the
process, RealtyTrac said in a  report  last month. Nationwide, the
average was 348 days, according to the Irvine, California-based
property-data company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
