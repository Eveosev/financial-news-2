Chile â€™s central bank has space to cut
its benchmark  interest rate  after consumer prices rose less than
forecast in January, El Mercurio reported in its online edition
 Emol.com , citing Economy Minister Pablo Longueira.  The decision to reduce borrowing costs ultimately is up to
the central bank, the Santiago-based newspaper cited Longueira
as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
