Ernst & Young LLP agreed to pay a
record $2 million civil penalty for failing to fully evaluate
three annual audits of  Medicis Pharmaceutical Corp. (MRX) ’s financial
statements, according to the U.S. auditing regulator.  The  Public Company Accounting Oversight Board  censured
Ernst & Young, one of the so-called Big Four largest auditors,
and is collecting its largest fine ever, it said in a statement
today. The PCAOB, a non-profit corporation that regulates
auditing of U.S.-listed companies, also sanctioned four of Ernst
& Young’s current and former partners for breaking rules.  “These audit partners and Ernst & Young -- the company’s
outside auditor for more than 20 years -- failed to fulfill
their bedrock responsibility,” said James R. Doty, the PCAOB’s
chairman, in a statement.  The PCAOB accused Ernst & Young, which neither admitted nor
denied wrongdoing in the settlement, of failing to properly
evaluate Scottsdale, Arizona-based Medicis’ sales returns
reserves. The investigation began 11 months ago and, based on
PCAOB rules, had to be kept confidential until today’s
settlement.  “We have implemented changes to our policies and
procedures that directly address the PCAOB’s concerns and will
enhance quality in the future,”  Charles Perkins , an Ernst &
Young spokesman, said in a statement. “We take these issues
very seriously, and remain highly confident in the quality of
our audits.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
