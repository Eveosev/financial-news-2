Sakhalin Energy ,  Russia ’s liquefied
natural-gas producer, increased its revenue by $1 billion last
year after raising prices,  Vedomosti  reported today, citing
Chief Executive Officer Andrey Galayev.  The project may break even as soon as this spring rather
than in 2013 or 2014, as initially planned, Galayev told the
Moscow-based newspaper.  OAO Gazprom has a 50 percent stake in Sakhalin Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
