Eastern  Europe  loan-growth data
doesn’t point toward a “looming credit crunch,” according to
an report by  Raiffeisen Bank International AG , the region’s
third-biggest lender.  While there are “widespread fears that all of central and
eastern Europe and in particular, the sub-regions central Europe
and south eastern Europe, will be hit hard by the deleveraging
process that is undeniably taking place in Western Europe’s
banking sector,” most recent “loan growth developments --
including data from the second half of 2011 -- are not pointing
to a looming credit crunch” in the region, Gunter Deuber, an
analyst at Raiffeisen in Vienna, wrote in the report.  “The most recent high frequency data shows that loan
growth remains at decent levels in most central and eastern
European economies given the current economic situation,”
Deuber wrote in the report, adding that this held “especially
true for  Russia  and most central eastern countries, with the
possible exception of  Hungary .” According to Raiffeisen’s
definition that region also included  Poland , Slovakia and the
 Czech Republic .  The analyst also said that a “certain deleveraging is
visible” in countries including Ukraine, Hungary and some south
eastern countries, a region which consists of Croatia, Bulgaria,
Romania, Serbia and Bosnia, according to the report.  All of eastern Europe’s biggest lenders need to raise
 capital ratios  to meet requirements by the European Banking
Authority. The biggest banks in eastern Europe by assets are
 UniCredit SpA ,  Erste Group Bank AG , Raiffeisen,  Societe Generale
SA  and  KBC Groep NV .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
