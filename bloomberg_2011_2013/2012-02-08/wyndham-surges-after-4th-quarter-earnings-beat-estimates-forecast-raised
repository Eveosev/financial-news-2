Wyndham Worldwide Corp. (WYN) , the
franchiser of Days Inn hotels and Super 8 motels, climbed after
reporting fourth-quarter earnings that were higher than analysts
expected and boosting its full-year forecast.  The company, based in Parsippany,  New Jersey , rose 6.1
percent to a record $43.42 at the close of New York trading.  Adjusted income, excluding items such as non-cash
impairments, climbed to 47 cents a share from 46 cents a year
earlier, Wyndham said in a statement today. Analysts expected
earnings of 44 cents a share on that basis, according to the
average of nine estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Wyndham also raised its full-year adjusted-earnings
forecast to $2.85 to $3 a share, up from its October estimate of
$2.72 to $2.82, and boosted its quarterly dividend to 23 cents a
share from 15 cents.  The company beat estimates because of a “resilient
hospitality businesses and prudent deployment of its sizable
free  cash flow ” into buying back shares,  Joseph Greff , a New
York-based analyst at  JPMorgan Chase & Co ., wrote in a note to
investors today.  The U.S. hotel industry has been recovering from its lows
of 2009 and 2010. Occupancies in the top 25 U.S. markets climbed
to 67 percent last year from 64 percent in 2010, according to
 Smith Travel Research Inc.  of Hendersonville, Tennessee.  Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc.  was the first
major U.S. lodging company to report earnings, on Feb. 2. The
owner of the luxury St. Regis and W brands said fourth-quarter
profit fell after a payment from a lawsuit settlement boosted
year-earlier earnings and demand in Europe weakened.  To contact the reporter on this story:
