Fabio Capello resigned as coach of
 England ’s national soccer team, the Football Association said on
its website.  Capello’s resignation, effective immediately, follows the
coach’s decision to criticize the FA on Italian television after
it stripped  John Terry  of the captaincy before his court case in
July for alleged racial abuse against another player.  The announcement of Capello’s resignation was made after
the coach’s hour-long meeting with FA Chairman  David Bernstein 
and General Secretary Alex Horne at Wembley Stadium.  “I would like to stress that during today’s meeting and
throughout his time as England manager, Fabio has conducted
himself in an extremely professional manner,” Bernstein said in
the statement.  Capello, 65, told Italian television that Terry should
remain as captain.  Terry, who plays for Chelsea in England’s Premier League,
will stand trial on the charge July 9, a week after the 2012
European Championship ends.  He is accused of racially abusing Queens Park Rangers
defender  Anton Ferdinand  in an Oct. 23 Premier League match. He
has denied the charge and his lawyers have pleaded not guilty in
court.  It’s the second time that Terry has lost his captaincy.
Capello stripped him of the role in 2010 over allegations of
marital infidelity with the ex-girlfriend of former teammate
 Wayne Bridge . He was reinstated by Capello last year.  Capello was named national coach in 2007.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
