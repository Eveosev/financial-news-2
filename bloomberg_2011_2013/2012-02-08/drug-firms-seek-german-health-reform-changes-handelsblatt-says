Pharmaceutical companies want German
Health Minister Daniel Bahr to make changes to reforms that
include drug price cuts,  Handelsblatt  reported today, citing
Birgit Fischer, head of the German pharmaceutical industry trade
group  VFA .  The companies arenâ€™t being treated as partners and their
interests should be more fairly weighed with those of the
insurance companies, Fischer is quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
