Hungarian banks lost 210 billion
forint ($960 million) from a government plan that allowed early
repayment of foreign-currency mortgages at below-market exchange
rates, PSZAF, the financial regulator, estimated.  Lenders were able to deduct part of an extraordinary bank
tax from their losses, which cut the total cost of the mortgage
initiative by 88 billion forint, PSZAF said today in a  report  on
its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
