The Lithuanian banking industry
posted a profit last year as provisions declined and the economy
grew at the second-fastest pace in the European Union, the
central bank said.  Banks in the Baltic nation had a combined profit of 1.1
billion litai ($420 million), compared with a loss of 271.9
million litai in 2010, the Lietuvos Bankas, based in the
capital, Vilnius, said today on its  website .  After almost two years of losses, lenders began to post
profits in the second half of 2010 as  Lithuania â€™s economy
rebounded from a recession. The economy expanded 5.8 percent
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
