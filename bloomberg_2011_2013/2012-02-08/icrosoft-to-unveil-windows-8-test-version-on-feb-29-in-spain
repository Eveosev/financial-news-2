Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the world’s largest
software maker, will unveil the first broadly available test
version of the Windows 8 operating system on Feb. 29 in
Barcelona,  Spain , at a mobile industry show.  The Redmond, Washington-based company sent invitations via
e-mail for an event to show the test product, called the Windows
8 Consumer Preview. Microsoft is relying on the newest version
of Windows to make headway in the tablet-computer market. The
two-hour session is scheduled to take place during the  Mobile
World Congress  trade show.  Revenue from Windows software, which runs most of the
world’s personal computers, has missed analysts’ estimates in
four of the past five quarters, in part because some consumers
are defecting from laptops with Windows to tablets like Apple
Inc.’s iPad. Microsoft probably won’t be able to significantly
change that trend until Windows 8 goes on sale, Chief Financial
Officer  Peter Klein  said in an interview last month.  The company has declined to say when Windows 8 will be
officially released. Microsoft  shares  rose 1 percent to $30.66
at the close in  New York . The stock has increased 18 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
