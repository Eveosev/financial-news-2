Greece ’s Orthodox Church halted
broadcasts over its  radio station  after 22 years because of its
inability to cover losses amid the country’s economic crisis.  “The Church of Greece has decided to immediately suspend
the station’s radio signal given inflexible and tight economic
circumstances,” the Athens-based Holy Synod of Bishops said in
a  statement  today on its website.  Representatives of the station’s workers didn’t show up for
a scheduled meeting with a church-appointed committee today to
discuss a possible cut to wages to avoid job cuts, according to
the statement.  The journalists’ labor union  POESY  called on members to
support their colleagues by congregating at the station’s
offices, according to a text message today from the Athens-based
body.  Union members entered the station through a side door after
the main door was chained shut only to find that all doors had
been locked when they later attempted to leave,  Athens News
Agency reported, citing George Savvidis, head of the union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
