McDermott Will & Emery LLP  hired
 Jennifer R. Taylor , a former U.S. Justice Department prosecutor,
as the  law firm  expands its white-collar practice.  Taylor, 36, was a federal prosecutor in the fraud section
of the criminal division, handling securities, bank and
procurement fraud and investigations under the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, McDermott said today in a statement. She will
join the firm’s Washington office as a partner in its white-
collar and securities defense practice group.  “At a time when the government’s increased focus on
prosecuting financial fraud cases has never been greater, our
client demand for white-collar services has only grown
stronger,” Michael Kendall, head of the firm’s international
white-collar and securities defense practice group, said in the
statement.  McDermott is an international firm with more than 1,000
lawyers. It was the 28th-largest grossing law firm in fiscal
2010 with revenue of $788.5 million,  according  to the American
Lawyer, a trade publication.  To contact the reporter on this story:
