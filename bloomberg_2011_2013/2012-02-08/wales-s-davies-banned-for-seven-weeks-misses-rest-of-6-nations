Wales  lock Bradley Davies will miss
the rest of rugby’s 6 Nations Championship after receiving a
seven-week suspension for foul play, while Ireland flanker
Stephen Ferris was cleared of the same offense.  The incidents occurred during Wales’s 23-21 win over
Ireland in Dublin three days ago. Both players had hearings
today in London, 6 Nations organizers said in separate
statements.  Davies was banned for a second-half tackle where he lifted
and slammed Donncha Ryan to the ground, a foul which drew a
yellow card and penalty.  The 6 Nations disciplinary committee considered the citing
report and television footage, along with Davies’s explanation
of the incident, in handing down the ban,  organizers said .  Davies, who can appeal, is not eligible to play until March
26. The 6 Nations ends March 17.  Ferris was also charged with a tip-tackle after picking up
Ian Evans by the right leg and dumping him on his side in the
final minute of the game. He received a yellow card and Leigh
Halfpenny converted the penalty to give Wales the victory.  Following a review of video evidence and Ferris’s
explanation of the tackle, the disciplinary committee decided
not to uphold the citing, organizers said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
