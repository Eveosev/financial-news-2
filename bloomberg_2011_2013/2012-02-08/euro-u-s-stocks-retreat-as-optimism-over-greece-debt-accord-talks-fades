The euro erased earlier gains versus
the dollar and U.S. equities reversed their advance amid concern
that Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  and coalition party
members will fail to agree on terms for a bailout.      The euro slipped 0.2 percent to $1.3241 at 11:07 a.m. in
 New York  after yesterday reaching an almost two-month high. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2 percent, reversing a 0.3
percent earlier advance. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields were
little changed at 1.98 percent.     Papademos meets today with the nation’s political leaders
to negotiate terms of a 130 billion-euro ($172 billion) rescue
package, while the nation’s private creditors will meet in Paris
tomorrow to discuss a debt-restructuring deal.  “Regardless of all the deal making, in the final solution,
 Greece , its leaders and its people are not going to agree to
anything unless there is a silver lining and a return to
growth,” said  Michael Woolfolk , senior currency strategist in
New York at Bank of New York Mellon Corp. “It’s not credible to
think they’ll agree to measures that have recession as far as
the eye can see.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
