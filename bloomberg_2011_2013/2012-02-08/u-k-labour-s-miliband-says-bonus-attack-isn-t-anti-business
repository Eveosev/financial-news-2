U.K. opposition Labour Party leader
 Ed Miliband  will accuse Prime Minister David Cameron of
intervening only “haphazardly and belatedly” to cut bank
bonuses and say that attacking high pay doesn’t make Labour
anti-business.  “It is pro-business to demand responsibility at the top
and an end to the something-for-nothing culture which has
damaged our economy in the financial crisis at every level,
wrecked businesses and left everyone else squeezed,” Miliband
will tell an audience of academics tomorrow in Sheffield,
northern England, his office said.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  warned yesterday
that an “anti-business culture” would damage Britain, arguing
for an economy “built on rewards for success.” He was speaking
as Labour lawmakers voted after a debate in Parliament for all
banks to cut their bonuses, on the grounds that excessive pay is
hurting the country.  Stephen Hester , the chief executive officer of state-
controlled Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, said this week he
had considered quitting during a political dispute over his
bonus, which he decided to forego at the end of last month after
Labour called for a debate in Parliament on the payout.  Miliband will reply to Osborne tomorrow by saying that “by
defending an unreformed bonus culture, this government confuses
the interests of the economy as a whole with the interests of an
irresponsible few.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
