Graham Henry , who guided the All
Blacks to Rugby World Cup victory last year, will help develop
New Zealand’s next generation of elite coaches after being
appointed to a new mentoring role.  Henry, 65, signed a part-time contract through 2013 to work
with the country’s coaches at Super Rugby and national
championship level, the Wellington-based New Zealand Rugby Union
said today. He stepped down as All Blacks coach in November
after eight years in the job.  “His insights will be invaluable for our high performance
coaches,” NZRU Chief Executive Officer Steve Tew said in an e-
mailed statement.  Henry coached New Zealand to 88 wins in 103 elite Test
matches, an 85 percent success rate, and guided the All Blacks
to their first World Cup triumph since 1987 in October. The
former Auckland school headmaster had been linked with overseas
coaching roles following the victory, though had signaled his
intention to stay in  New Zealand .  “Even going back to my time as a teacher and headmaster, I
have been keen to help people grow and develop their skills and
to now move into a position of mentoring our leading coaches is
something I’m really looking forward to,” Henry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
