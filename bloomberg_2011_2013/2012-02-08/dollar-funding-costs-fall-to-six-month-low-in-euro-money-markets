The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars fell to the lowest in six months, according to a
money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 68 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:35 a.m. in
London, from minus 72 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The cost is the lowest since Aug. 5.  The one-year basis swap was 57 basis points less than
Euribor, the lowest since Sept. 2. It was minus 59 yesterday. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of European banksâ€™ reluctance to lend to one
another rose for the first day since Jan. 20. The Euribor-OIS
spread, the difference between the borrowing benchmark and
overnight indexed swaps, was 75 basis points in  London , from 74
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lenders reduced  overnight deposits  at the  European Central
Bank , placing 495 billion euros ($657 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday from 503 billion euros on Feb. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
