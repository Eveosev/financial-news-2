The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Mexico  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close of trading.  The IPC  index  rose 0.2 percent to 38,140.55.  Alfa SAB (ALFAA)  , the world’s largest producer of
aluminum engine heads, rose 2 percent to 174.57 pesos. The
possible initial public offering of the company’s Alpek
petrochemicals unit may “liberate value,” making Alfa stock
attractive at its current price, Monex Casa de Bolsa said today
in an e-mailed research note.  Separately, the company said today that fourth-quarter
profit declined 51 percent to 1.1 billion pesos ($86.5 million),
while sales rose 33 percent to 48.3 billion pesos.  Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO)  , the world’s largest
Spanish-language broadcaster, rose 1.4 percent to 51.29 pesos.
The company was upgraded to “buy” from “hold” at Corp.
Actinver SAB by analyst Martin Lara, who said the stock’s recent
slump created an “attractive entry point for long-term
investors.”  Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste SAB  (ASURB MM), the
operator of airports in southern Mexico, rose 0.8 percent to
86.35 pesos. Passenger traffic climbed 10 percent in January
from a year earlier, the company said in a statement to the
Mexican stock exchange today.  Vitro SAB (VITROA)  , the Mexican glassmaker that
defaulted on $1.5 billion of bonds in 2009, jumped 4.9 percent
to 14.96 pesos. The company said yesterday that a judge in
Monterrey gave final approval to restructure its debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
