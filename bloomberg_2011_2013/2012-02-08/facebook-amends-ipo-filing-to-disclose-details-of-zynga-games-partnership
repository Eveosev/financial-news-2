Facebook Inc. (FB) , which is planning a $5
billion initial public offering, said it’s working with online-
gaming company  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA)  to fuel growth.  The cooperation, outlined by  Menlo Park , California-based
Facebook in a  regulatory filing  today, matched a disclosure made
by Zynga as the maker of social games prepared for its December
IPO.  Facebook and Zynga want to “work together to increase the
number of users of each party’s products and services,”
Facebook said in today’s filing. Zynga grants Facebook exclusive
game titles, and the two companies are working together to set
growth targets for monthly unique users of Zynga games, the
filing shows.  Facebook is responsible for more than 90 percent of Zynga’s
sales, according to a regulatory document filed by Zynga in
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
