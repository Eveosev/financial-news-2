Rick Santorum  won the Minnesota
Republican caucuses, television networks projected, his second
victory out of three contests today as he revived his candidacy
and aimed to establish himself as the main alternative to Mitt Romney in the party’s presidential race.  Networks including MSNBC and CNN called the race for
Santorum.  Santorum had 46 percent of the vote in Minnesota, with 33
percent of precincts reporting, according to the Associated
Press tally. U.S. Representative  Ron Paul  of Texas had 27
percent, followed by Romney with 16 percent and former U.S.
Speaker  Newt Gingrich  with 11 percent.  Santorum also won today’s non-binding primary in Missouri.
He had 55 percent of the vote, with 81 percent of precincts
reporting, according to the AP. The so-called beauty contest
primary has no bearing on allocation of the state’s convention
delegates, which will be awarded at caucuses beginning next
month.  Caucuses are also being conducted tonight in  Colorado .  Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, before
today hadn’t run strongly in any contest since he defeated Mitt
Romney by 34 votes in the lead-off Iowa caucuses on Jan. 3 -- a
result announced more than two weeks later by state officials.  To contact the reporters on this story:
