Bakken oil slumped to the widest
discount since at least 2010 after  North Dakota  boosted output.  Production from the state increased 4.7 percent to 534,884
barrels a day in December from the previous month, the North
Dakota Oil and Gas Division reported on its  website  today.  Bakken (USCSUHC1)  fell to $5 to $27 a barrel below West Texas
Intermediate crude at 2:08 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, the weakest level in records dating to
Oct. 1, 2010.  Syncrude’s discount to the U.S. benchmark widened after
Syncrude Canada Ltd. was said to have completed work at the 8-1
coker at the oil-sands upgrader in  Alberta . The unit resumed
production after undergoing work earlier this month, a person
with knowledge of the situation said yesterday. The person
declined to be identified because the information isn’t public.  The discount for  Syncrude (USCSSYNS)  widened $3 to $21. Syncrude is a
light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in
Alberta.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount to WTI widened 50 cents to
$33 a barrel.  In the U.S. Gulf Coast,  Light Louisiana Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium to
WTI added 75 cents to $18.25 a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet
increased $1 to $21.50 over the U.S. benchmark.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI widened 35 cents to $18.60
and Mars Blend’s fell $1.50 to $14.  Poseidon (USCSPOSE) ’s premium narrowed
25 cents to $15 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon (USCSSGCN)  was unchanged at
a premium of $14.75 over WTI.  West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount strengthened 20 cents to $4.05 a
barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
