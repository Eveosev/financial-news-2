International arms dealer  Viktor Bout 
lost a bid to overturn his conviction for plotting to sell a
terrorist group millions of dollars worth of weapons including
surface-to-air missiles.  U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in  Manhattan  rejected
the motion today at a hearing where Bout complained about
conditions at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York.  Bout, a former Soviet air force officer once called the
“merchant of death,” was found guilty of conspiracy by a jury
last year for attempting to conduct an arms sale with two men
posing as members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.
He has yet to be sentenced.  Bout was arrested in Bangkok in March 2008 in a sting
operation set up by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and
flown to  New York  for prosecution.  At today’s hearing, Bout complained to the judge about his
solitary detention and asked to be released into the general
inmate population at the Lower Manhattan federal jail, where
Scheindlin said his conditions seemed “harsh” and “brutal.”  The case is U.S. v. Bout, 08-cr-0365, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
