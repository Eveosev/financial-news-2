German Deputy Finance Minister Thomas Steffen said euro-region governments are working toward getting
 Greece ’s private creditors to treat a March 20 bond redemption
as part of the private-sector involvement to help the country
return to sustainable public finances.  “Our goal is that Greece won’t have to repay the 14.5
billion-euro ($19.2 billion) tranche on March 20, but that this
tranche will already be part of the private-sector
involvement,” Steffen said today in a speech in Berlin.
“That’s what we’re working on and that results in our ambitious
schedule.”  To that effect, governments are also aiming to make an
official bond-swap offer to Greece’s private creditors next
week, Steffen said. Creditors could then accept or refuse the
offer within two weeks, he said.  Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government is readying plans for
parliamentary votes on a bailout for Greece as soon as next
week, Michael Meister, the deputy floor leader of Merkel’s
 Christian Democrats , said today. That suggests the German
government, the biggest contributor to euro-area rescues, is
looking beyond the bailout talks playing out in  Athens  over the
past six days in anticipation of a successful outcome.  To contact the reporter on this story:
