Cementos Pacasmayo SAA (CPACASI1) , which
completed a $230 million share offering in  New York , has
“substantial growth potential” with its cement plant expansion
and phosphate project, said Eduardo Hochschild, chairman of the
company’s owner Hochschild Group.  “The share will go up, down, sideways and what have you,
and that’s what it usually does,” Hochschild said today in a
telephone interview from New York after the shares fell as much
as 14.6 percent. “In liquidity, New York has more than London
and was best for the company.”  The group’s gold and silver mining company  Hochschild
Mining Plc (HOC)  trades in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
