Nexans SA (NEX) , the world’s second-largest
maker of cables and wires, jumped the most in more than four
months after reporting a rise in its 2011 operating profit
margin and predicting further revenue growth this year.  The company’s shares rose as much as 9.9 percent in Paris
trading, the biggest intraday gain since Sept. 27, 2011. They
were up 7.6 percent at 10:21 p.m. at 50.43 euros.  “Despite an uncertain environment, we are approaching 2012
with confidence in the group’s capacity to grow further, should
the current economic environment remain the same,” Chief
Executive Officer  Frederic Vincent  said in a statement.  Nexans, based in Paris, said its operating  margin  at
constant non-ferrous metal prices rose to 5.6 percent in 2011
from 4.8 percent in 2010. Like-for-like sales climbed 6.5
percent last year.  Italy’s  Prysmian SpA  is the world’s largest cable maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
