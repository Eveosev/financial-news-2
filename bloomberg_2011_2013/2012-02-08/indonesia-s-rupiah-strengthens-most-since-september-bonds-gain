The rupiah strengthened the most
since September and bonds advanced for a 10th day as demand for
the  Indonesia ’s sovereign debt indicated improving investor
confidence in the nation’s assets.  The country sold 12 trillion rupiah ($1.4 billion) of
local-currency bonds yesterday, exceeding its 8 trillion rupiah
target, the  finance ministry  said in a statement. The sale drew
42.38 trillion rupiah of bids, it said.  Gross domestic product 
rose 6.46 percent in 2011, after a revised 6.20 percent gain the
previous year, the statistics bureau said this week.  “Demand for  government bonds  was much more than the target
as foreigners participated in the sale,” said Bambang Eko Joewono, the Jakarta-based head of the global-markets division
at PT Bank UOB Indonesia. “Investors are attracted to the
strong economic fundamentals of Indonesia.”  The rupiah appreciated 1.2 percent to 8,886 per dollar as
of 4 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest advance since Sept.
27. The currency touched 8,881 earlier, the strongest level
since Feb. 2.  Moody’s Investors Service awarded Indonesia an investment-
grade credit rating last month, following  Fitch Ratings  in
December.  Offshore funds  boosted holdings of Indonesian
government debt by 5.6 percent to 235.3 trillion rupiah this
year through Feb. 6, according to finance ministry data.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bond due May 2022
fell seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 5.18
percent today, according to the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
