Theratechnologies Inc. (TH) , the developer
of an HIV drug, sank the most in six months after failing to
provide a sales forecast with its quarterly financial results.  The Montreal-based company, which makes the medicine
Egrifta, plunged 14 percent to C$2.26 after Chief Financial
Officer Luc Tanguay declined to make estimates on a conference
call with analysts. It was the biggest decline since Aug. 8.  “While revenue was in line, we believe that short-term
sentiment will be weighed down by the lack of fiscal year 2012
revenue guidance and the underlying tone of the conference call,
which signaled that trends in recent months have yet to show an
upward inflection point in Egrifta sales momentum,” Pooya Hemami, an analyst at Desjardins Securities, wrote in a note to
clients.  Theratechnologies tumbled 54 percent in the year ending
yesterday as Egrifta sales trailed the estimates of analysts
including Philippa Flint of Bloom Burton & Co.. The company’s
product reduces abdominal-fat accumulation in patients with HIV.  The company reported a loss excluding some items of 2
Canadian cents a share in the fourth quarter. Analysts had
 estimated  a loss of 6 Canadian cents a share, according to the
average of three forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
