Statoil ASA (STL) , Norway’s largest oil
producer, said fourth-quarter profit more than doubled as the
explorer found more oil and gas than it produced for the first
time since 2005.  New resources from exploration climbed above 1.1 billion
barrels of oil equivalent in 2011, a so-called reserve
replacement ratio of 117 percent compared with about 300,000
barrels in 2010, Chief Executive Officer  Helge Lund  said at a
press conference today.  “We’re putting more resources in the bank than we’re
using,” Lund said, adding that the company drilled 41
exploration wells and made 22 discoveries in 2011. Exploration
expenditure will be around $3 billion to drill around 40 wells
in 2012, he said.  The state-controlled company has plans to raise output to
2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2020 as it
expands abroad and seeks to maintain production at home. Its
ambitions were bolstered last year by the discovery of the Johan
Sverdrup deposit in the  North Sea , which may hold 3.3 billion
barrels of oil equivalent, as well as finds in the  Barents Sea .  Net income rose to 25.5 billion kroner ($4.4 billion) from
9.5 billion kroner a year earlier, the Stavanger-based company
said today. That beat the 13.3 billion-krone average estimate of
nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales rose 22 percent to
174 billion kroner.  ‘Improving Trend’  Reserve replacement “shows an improving trend over the
last few years,” Citigroup Inc. analyst Michael Alsford said in
a note to investors today. “Despite the improvement in reserve
replacement, we continue to see a re-investment risk as the
company looks to deepen its  resource base  further for longer-
term growth.”  Statoil shares gained 1.3 percent to 152 kroner in Oslo
trading, valuing the company at 484.7 million kroner.  The company, which operates about 80 percent of  Norway ’s
oil and gas production, is seeking to keep up output from
maturing fields at home as it expands abroad. Norway’s oil
output has halved since 2000 and Statoil has struggled to
replace reserves. This year’s replacement ratio climbed from a
low of 0.34 in 2008. It was last above 100 percent in 2005.  “The oil and gas industry on a global basis is at full
capacity,” Lund said in an interview. “We as a company need to
work with our own cost base to make it more efficient.”
Measures being employed by the company include standardizing
equipment, using the same suppliers to drive economies of scale
and having teams focus on a series of projects, he said.  Pipeline Sale  Average liquid prices rose 19 percent while gas prices
increased 22 percent, the company said. Profit was also boosted
by the sale of a stake in Norwegian pipeline owner Gassled for
17.4 billion kroner.  The explorer expanded its stake in U.S. unconventional
assets last year with the $4.4 billion acquisition of Brigham
Exploration Co., becoming one of the top 10 holders of Bakken
shale acreage. Statoil entered U.S. shale gas resources in 2008
by buying $3.38 billion in assets from  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) 
In June it bought Eagle Ford shale acreage from  SM Energy Co. (SM)   “Unconventional resources will play an increasingly
important part in global  energy supply . We want to play there,”
Lund said. The break-even level for the Bakken field is around
$55 a barrel, he added. “Our key focus is now on the U.S., but
of course we have deep knowledge about the European markets and
if we saw some interesting opportunities we could always
evaluate that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
