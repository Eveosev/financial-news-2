Thailand ’s publicly traded banks may
have to pay a fee amounting to as much as 0.6 percent of their
total deposits to the central bank as part of a debt repayment
plan,  Krung Thai Bank Pcl  President Apisak Tantivorawong said.  The Bank of Thailand said last month it plans to collect a
fee equivalent to as much as 1 percent of total deposits to help
raise funds to pay debt. Thai lenders currently pay a fee
amounting to 0.4 percent of total deposits into the central
bank’s deposit-protection fund.  The new fee “shouldn’t exceed 0.6 percent,” Apisak told
reporters today, without saying when the rate may be fixed.  The Thai Bankers Association said last month the move was
“unfair” to commercial lenders because state-run banks aren’t
required to pay the levy. The fee increase may cause distortions
in the industry because state-run banks account for about 30
percent of total deposits, Apisak said today.  “That’s a big proportion, and the central bank can’t
control it,” he said. “This reduces the effectiveness of
policy transmission.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
