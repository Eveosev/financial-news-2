European (SXXP)  stocks dropped for a third
day as BHP Billiton Ltd. declined, offsetting gains by companies
from  Statoil ASA (STL)  to  Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/)  after they
posted earnings that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  BHP Billiton retreated 2.3 percent.  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) 
tumbled 14 percent, its biggest retreat in a month, as the
company posted an annual loss four times wider than analysts had
estimated. Statoil climbed 1.3 percent after reporting profit
that more than doubled on rising oil prices. Reckitt Benckiser
rallied after saying 2012 sales will increase at a faster pace
than the industry.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.2 percent to 263.01 at
the close, after earlier advancing as much as 0.6 percent. The
benchmark measure  has still rallied 22 percent  from last year’s
low and  7.6 percent  this year as investors speculated that
 Greece  will accept the spending cuts needed to obtain further
financial aid from the rest of the euro area.  “I’m assuming for the moment that Greece will stay in the
euro zone and this week or next week we will have an agreement
on Greek debt talks,”  Bob Parker , a senior adviser at Credit
Suisse Asset Management, said in a Bloomberg Television
interview. “For the next few months, we’ll probably flat line
in markets. In the second half, there is very strong ground to
start a one- to two-year rally.”  National benchmark indexes climbed in 10 of the 18 western-
 European (SXXP)  markets today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index fell 0.2
percent. France’s CAC 40 Index and Germany’s DAX Index decreased
0.1 percent.  Greek Spending Cuts  Greece’s Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  met the leaders of
the three political parties that support his government in
 Athens  today. He held an unscheduled meeting late last night
with the troika -- the European Commission, the  European Central
Bank  and the  International Monetary Fund  -- to haggle over the
terms needed to secure further aid.  Of the 94  Stoxx 600 companies  that have reported quarterly
earnings since Jan. 9, 45 have missed analysts’ estimates,
compared with 44 that have beaten their projections, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BHP Billiton  retreated 2.3 percent to 2,130 pence. The
 world’s biggest mining company  reported a 5.5 percent drop in
first-half profit, the first decline since 2009, as rising costs
and lower output and prices cut its earnings from base metals by
half. Net income fell to $9.9 billion in the six months through
December from $10.5 billion a year earlier, the company said in
a statement.  Vestas Shares Tumble  Vestas plunged 14 percent to 57.50 kroner for the largest
slump on the  Stoxx 600 . The world’s biggest wind-turbine maker
reported an annual loss of 166 million euros ($220 million),
according to its annual report. The  average estimate  of 16
analysts called for a loss of 40.3 million euros, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Portugal’s PSI 20 Index jumped 1.9 percent.  Banco Espirito
Santo SA (BES)  surged 13 percent to 1.67 euros, while  Banco Comercial
Portugues SA (BCP)  rose 5.1 percent to 18.5 euro cents.  Banco Comercial rose on speculation that Portugal’s second-
biggest bank’s plan to change its chief executive officer has
prompted investors to stop betting the shares will fall. Banco
Comercial said on Jan. 30 that CEO Carlos Santos Ferreira will
leave his post and Nuno Amado, the former CEO of the Portuguese
unit of Banco Santander SA, may replace him.  Bank shares increased 0.6 percent for the biggest gain
among the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600.  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,
Italy’s biggest lender, added 2.2 percent to 4.48 euros.  Intesa
Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) , the country’s second-largest bank, gained 3
percent to 1.60 euros.  Statoil, Reckitt Benckiser  Statoil climbed 1.3 percent to 152 kroner. Norway’s
national oil company reported fourth-quarter  net income  of 25.5
billion kroner ($4.4 billion), beating the average analyst
estimate for income of 13.3 billion kroner.  Reckitt Benckiser advanced 2.9 percent to 3,479 pence. The
maker of Nurofen painkillers and Dettol kitchen spray said 2012
sales will increase at a faster pace than the industry after
reporting  fourth-quarter earnings  that beat estimates.  Non-pharmaceutical revenue  will climb 3 percent to 4
percent this year, compared with growth of 1 percent to 2
percent in the broader market, the company said, adding that it
aims to maintain profitability.  Mobistar SA (MOBB)  sank 9 percent to 36.77 euros. Belgium’s
second-biggest mobile-phone company  forecast  that the decline in
its profit will accelerate this year, missing analysts’
estimates. Net income will drop to 182.5 million euros, plus or
minus 12.5 million euros, the company said. That compared with
analyst projections for 2012 profit of 220.8 million euros, the
 average of 13 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Nexans SA (NEX)  jumped 9 percent to 51.78 euros. The world’s
second-largest maker of cables and wires reported an increase in
its 2011 operating profit margin and predicted further revenue
growth this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
