Societe Generale  SA recommended that
investors buy Mexican stocks to take advantage of rising exports
and sell Brazilian equities on the potential for a drop in
commodities prices.  “Given a much softer economy in  Brazil  and a potential
commodity pull-back,”  Mexico  “may have more short-term
upside,” Rebecca Cheong, an equity derivatives strategist at
Societe Generale in  New York , wrote in an e-mailed note today.  Mexican manufacturers will likely increase exports to the
U.S. as rising labor and shipping costs in  China  hurt the Asian
nation’s sales overseas, Cheong wrote.  Mexico’s  IPC (MEXBOL)  stock index has advanced 2.7 percent this
year, while Brazil’s benchmark  Bovespa (IBOV)  has gained 16 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
