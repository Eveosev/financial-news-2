Deutsche Bank AG  won dismissal of two
lawsuits in which investors in residential mortgage-backed
securities accused the bank of selling them securitized loans it
internally disparaged as “crap.”  U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in  Manhattan , in an order
filed yesterday, dismissed two separate lawsuits by Brussels-
based  Dexia SA  and Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of
America. The investors had “in certain key respects” failed to
provide sufficient particular facts to support their fraud
allegations, the judge said.  Rakoff said he would issue a more specific written opinion
at a later date. The investors could amend their claims in so
far as these relied on loans sponsored by Deutsche Bank
Structured Products, the judge said.  Gerald Silk , a lawyer representing the investors in both
cases, didn’t immediately return a call after regular business
hours yesterday seeking comment on the ruling.  The cases are Dexia v. Deutsche Bank, 11-05672, and
Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America v.
Deutsche Bank, 11-06141, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of  New York  (Manhattan.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
