A man parts with his family on a
solemn Greek grave relief from the fourth century BC.  Nearby, there’s a set of six marble doors by Ai Weiwei
dating to 2007.  Sperone Westwater, the edgy Norman Foster-designed art
emporium on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, is presenting a
surprising historical extravaganza sprawling through centuries.  “Marble Sculpture from 350 B.C. to Last Week,” shows 45
ancient and contemporary objects mingling with ease.  Among the most amusing pieces: Aldo Mondino’s “Trophy”
(1996), which substitutes a pair of spread-out female legs for
the traditional horn porn featuring mounted antlers.  Also memorable: Bertozzi & Casoni’s “GorilBattista”
(2011), a beautifully chiseled marble of a serene, sad gorilla
head resting on a platter a la John the Baptist.  Melancholy Medici  There’s a companion exhibition, “Portraits/Self-Portraits:
From the 16th to the 21st Century,” on the upper floors.  Among the earliest is Alessandro Allori’s portrait of one
of the lesser and later Medicis, Francesco I, wearing a handsome
outfit of leather and fur and a melancholy expression. His was a
complicated life that ended probably by poison.  Robert Lefevre’s 1804 “Portrait of Michael Elias Meyer,”
shows the young merchant fashionably buttoned and beribboned.  The third floor displays portraits by Picasso, Picabia,
Warhol and Gilbert & George.  Most works come from the personal collection of Gian Enzo
Sperone, a partner in the gallery. The Ionian relief is
$400,000, while Gilbert & George will set you back $850,000.  Through Feb. 25 at 257 Bowery, +1-212-999-7337;

of people, prints of smashed-up faces and rows of television
screens are just a few components of Jon Kessler’s dizzying
installation, “The Blue Period.”  It takes a while to figure out how all of the static and
kinetic parts fit together. You may spot your own face on one of
the screens, recorded by a camera and played in a kaleidoscopic
sequence that includes footage from the Blue Man Group and  Mel Gibson ’s “Apocalypto.”  Prices range from $4,500 for individual prints to $250,000
for the entire installation. Through March 10 at 243 Bowery, +1-
212-979-0001; http:// www.salon94.com.  Malcolm Morley  At Sue Scott Gallery around the corner, Malcolm Morley’s
playful prints of boats and planes resemble children’s book
illustrations: Colorful flags fly in the wind, the water is
blue, beach umbrellas are open.  Look more closely. Colliding aircraft are plunging into the
sea, boats are sinking and people are flying through the air.  Prices range from $1,500 to $22,000. “Malcolm Morley:
Another Way to Make and Image, Monotypes” runs through Feb. 19
at 1 Rivington St.; +1-212-358-8767;
