Ethanol futures rose to a four-week
high on signs that the industry is reducing production.  Futures rose for a third day after  Archer Daniels Midland
Co. (ADM) , the second-largest U.S. ethanol producer, said it would
shutter a plant in  North Dakota  and the Energy Department
reported that  output  fell to the lowest level in 11 weeks amid
negative margins to make the fuel.  “This all started with the ADM announcement,” said Jerrod
Kitt, an analyst at the Linn Group in Chicago. “Then today’s
report had people saying, ‘Gee, things really are bad enough to
start pulling back.’”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery increased 1.3 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $2.224 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the highest price since Jan. 11. Prices are down 6.8
percent from a year earlier.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast surged
6.5 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $2.30 a gallon and in the U.S.
Gulf the additive gained 3 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $2.245,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  added 3 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
$2.265 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel rose 2.5 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $2.17.  Ethanol production  in the U.S. fell 1.7 percent to 923,000
barrels a day last week, the steepest decline since Jan. 6, and
the lowest level since Nov. 18, an Energy Department report
showed today.  Producers are losing 11 cents per gallon of ethanol, based
on current prices for corn and the biofuel and assuming a bushel
of corn generates 2.75 gallons of ethanol, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The biofuel is blended with gasoline to stretch supply and
meet federal mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
