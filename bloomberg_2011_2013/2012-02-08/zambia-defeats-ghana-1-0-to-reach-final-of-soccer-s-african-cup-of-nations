Zambia defeated Ghana 1-0 to advance
to the final of soccer’s African Cup of Nations for the first
time in 18 years.  Emmanuel Mayuka scored in the 78th minute in Bata,
 Equatorial Guinea , to send Zambia to its third final and first
since 1994. Zambia, which has never won Africa’s continental
championship, will meet the winner of today’s second semifinal
between  Ivory Coast  and Mali in four days in Libreville, Gabon.  Zambia goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene dived to stop Asamoah
Gyan’s penalty kick in the first half. Four-time champion Ghana
finished with 10 men after Derek Boateng received his second
yellow card in the 84th minute.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
