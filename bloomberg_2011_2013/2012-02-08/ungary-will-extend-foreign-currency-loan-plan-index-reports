Hungaryâ€™s government plans to extend
until June 30, 2017 a foreign-currency loan-repayment program
under which borrowers can service debt at fixed exchange rates,
news website  Index  reported, citing a draft law it obtained.  The current deadline is the end of 2016 and banks support
an extension, the website said.  Under the program, non-delinquent borrowers can limit
installments based on a discounted exchange rate of 180 forint
per franc and 250 forint per euro, with the government and banks
sharing interest payments on top of that, Index said. That may
cost the budget as much as 154 billion forint ($708 million)
over the duration of the program, the website said.  The draft bill allows borrowers who are leasing their
properties to take part in the program and stipulates that the
government can offer non-repayable financial support to public-
sector workers until July 1 this year, Index reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
