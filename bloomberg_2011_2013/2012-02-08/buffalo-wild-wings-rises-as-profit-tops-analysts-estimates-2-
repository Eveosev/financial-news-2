Buffalo Wild Wings Inc. , the
restaurant chain with more than 800 locations, rose in extended
trading after reporting a 34 percent increase in fourth-quarter
profit that topped analysts’ estimates.  The shares jumped 16 percent to $81.40 at 7:41 p.m. in  New
York  after closing regular trading at $70.19. Buffalo Wild Wings
 gained  54 percent last year.  Net income rose to $13.6 million, or 73 cents a share, from
$10.2 million, or 55 cents, a year earlier, the Minneapolis-
based company said today in a statement. Analysts projected 67
cents, the average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Buffalo Wild Wings, which plans to have 900 restaurants by
the end of this year, has sought to attract consumers with
flavored wings, shareable appetizers and draft beer. Customers
ate a record 7.7 million wings on Super Bowl Sunday this year,
Chief Executive Officer Sally Smith said today on an earnings
call with analysts and investors.  Smith said the company will expand to 1,500 locations in
five to seven years and may seek to acquire other restaurant
brands to help fuel growth.  “It is very early and something that we started talking
about probably mid-year last year as we looked at our growth,”
Smith said today in a telephone interview. Buffalo Wild Wings
would most likely be “interested in a small, emerging chain”
in the casual-dining or fast-casual industry, she said.  An  acquisition  would probably be funded with a combination
of debt and cash “depending on the size of the chain that we’re
looking at,” she said.  Sales at company-owned stores open at least 15 months rose
8.9 percent in the quarter. Sales at franchised locations
increased 5.9 percent.  Revenue advanced 34 percent to $220.5 million in the
quarter ended Dec. 25. Analysts projected $210.6 million, on
average. The company reiterated its  forecast  for full-year
profit growth of 20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
