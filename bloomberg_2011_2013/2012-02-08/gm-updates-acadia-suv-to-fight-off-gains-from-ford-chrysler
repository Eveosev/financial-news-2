General Motors Co. (GM)  unveiled an
updated GMC Acadia at the Chicago Auto Show, the first of its
mid-size sport-utility vehicles to get refreshed as  Ford Motor
Co. (F)  and Chrysler Group LLC make gains.  The Acadia, Chevrolet Traverse and Buick Enclave are made
on the same vehicle platform and combined U.S. sales last year
totaled 244,811, a 6.2 percent gain from 2010. That trailed
gains of competing models made by Ford and Chrysler, according
to researcher Autodata Corp.  “There is obviously a disconnect” between newer models
such as Chrysler’s Jeep Grand Cherokee and the older GM models,
said Jessica Caldwell, an industry analyst with Edmunds.com, a
 Santa Monica , California-based website that tracks auto sales.  The competition for mid-size SUV sales is one example of
how GM, based in  Detroit , is being challenged this year to hold
onto its 2011 marketing gains. Its share of the U.S. market rose
to 19.6 percent from 19.1 percent in 2010 and the company
supplanted  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  as the world’s largest automaker.  “The importance of this is huge,”  Mark Reuss , president
of GM North America, said during an interview last month in
advance of the Chicago show, which began today with press
conferences by automakers. “We completely redid the outside and
inside of this vehicle. When you see it, I think, I know it’s
going to be dramatic.”  The freshened Acadia goes on sale late this year as a 2013
model. GM fell 1.8 percent to $25.75 at the close in  New York .  ‘Neglected Segment’  A redesigned Explorer SUV helped Ford more than double U.S.
sales of the SUV to 135,704 while deliveries of Chrysler’s new
Durango rose to 51,697 from 572 the year before and  Jeep Grand
Cherokee  increased 51 percent to 127,744.  GM also faces competition from Toyota and Honda Motor Co.
Toyota sold 101,252 Highlander and 44,316 4Runner mid-size SUVs
last year. Sales of Honda’s Pilot, last redesigned in 2008, rose
14 percent last year to 116,297, making it top-selling mid-size
model among Asian automakers in the segment.  “I can see why GM, perhaps, didn’t want to throw as much
money into these products because it’s kind of been a neglected
segment over the past years with the high gas prices and people
shifting to smaller cars,” said Caldwell of Edmunds.  Even with the competition, sales of the Acadia, which first
went on sale in 2007, surged 16 percent last year to 79,288, the
largest gain among the three GM SUVs.  ‘Perfect Momentum’  “We’ve got the perfect momentum in the market place and
we’re just making it that much better,” Tony DiSalle, GM’s vice
president for Buick and GMC marketing, said in a telephone
interview last week.  The Acadia, with half of its customers being women, helped
the GMC brand appeal to new shoppers with its improved fuel
efficiency and three rows of seats,  Rebecca Lindland , an analyst
with IHS Automotive, said in a telephone interview this week.  “What the Acadia really did for GMC was it got them a
crossover vehicle that would appeal to a much broader
audience,” she said. “It really expanded the brand into a new
demographic.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
