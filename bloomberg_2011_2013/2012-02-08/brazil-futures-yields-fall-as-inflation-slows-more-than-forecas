Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts headed for a record low after a report showing
consumer prices slowed more than forecast fueled speculation
that policy makers will cut borrowing costs below 10 percent.  The yield on the contract due in January 2013 fell three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 9.42 percent at 9:40
a.m. in  Sao Paulo .  Consumer prices as measured by the IPC-S index rose 0.46
percent in the 30 days through Feb. 7, from 0.81 percent in the
previous period, the Getulio Vargas Foundation said today. That
was less than the 0.65 percent median estimate of 21 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Inflation figures were very comforting,”  Newton Rosa ,
chief economist at SulAmerica Investimentos, said by phone from
Sao Paulo. “Investors are sure the central bank will lower the
benchmark lending rate to a single-digit level.”  Policy makers have cut the Selic rate 200 basis points
since August to 10.5 percent. They signaled in the minutes of
their January meeting that they are likely to trim the lending
rate below 10 percent.  The real advanced 0.2 percent to 1.7214 per dollar, from
1.7256 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
