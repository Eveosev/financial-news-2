University of North Dakota  President
 Robert Kelley  said the school will resume using the nickname of
Fighting Sioux after referendum supporters filed petitions
asking that it be put to a statewide vote.  In 2005, college sports’ governing body adopted a policy
prohibiting the use of hostile and abusive American Indian
imagery at National Collegiate Athletic Association championship
events.  North Dakota sued the NCAA to challenge its inclusion on
the list of schools deemed to be using hostile or abusive names
and imagery. The parties settled the lawsuit, with the
university retiring the Fighting Sioux nickname and logo except
where it has a historical purpose, and went with no nickname and
an interlocking “N” and “D” symbol.  “I want to reaffirm our respect for the laws of the state
and the process guaranteed under the  North Dakota 
Constitution,” Kelley said in a statement.  University spokesman Peter Johnson said the school was
directed to resume using the logo by the State Board of Higher
Education until the issue is resolved. A vote may be held in
June, according to the  Associated Press .  NCAA spokesman Erik Christianson said the school is still
subject to the policy, meaning that it if reverts to using the
nickname and logo, it cannot host an NCAA championship event and
is prohibited from using the nickname and imagery on uniforms
for athletes, cheerleaders, mascots and band members during any
championship events.  The university created a  blog  to provide a historical
account of the nickname and legal actions taken.  To contact the reporter on this story:
