Greece will pledge permanent spending
cuts, including lower pension payments and a 20 percent
reduction in the minimum wage, as the economy contracts this
year at a faster pace than originally estimated, according to
the draft of a new financing deal with the European Union and
 International Monetary Fund .  “To restore competitiveness and growth, we will accelerate
implementation of deep structural reforms in the labor, product
and service markets,” according to the letter of intent
addressed to IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde in a
document obtained by Bloomberg News.   The letter, attached to the 43-page Greek-language draft
agreement, is to be signed by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos,
Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos and  Bank of Greece  Governor
 George Provopoulos .  To contact the reporter on this story:
