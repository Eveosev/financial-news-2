 Spanish  industrial production  fell
for the fourth month in December as efforts to rein in the
 budget deficit  pushed the euro areaâ€™s fourth-largest economy
back into a recession.  Output at factories, refineries and mines adjusted for the
number of working days declined 3.7 percent from a year earlier,
the National Statistics Institute said in an e-mailed statement
in  Madrid  today. The figure compares with a decline of 7 percent
in November, the deepest in two years, and a median estimate for
a 5.7 percent contraction in a Bloomberg survey of nine
economists.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  has stepped up austerity
efforts since taking office in December even as his government
estimates Spain entered its second recession in two years in the
final quarter of 2011. The Bank of  Spain  forecasts the economy
will shrink by 1.5 percent this year amid additional spending
cuts.  Spain last year failed to meet its budget-deficit target of
6 percent of gross domestic product and the government says it
now aims to reduce the shortfall to 4.4 percent this year from 8
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
