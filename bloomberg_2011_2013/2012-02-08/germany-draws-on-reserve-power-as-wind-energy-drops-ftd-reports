Germany  used reserve power supplies
today as cold weather kept demand high and wind-energy supplies
dipped, the  Financial Times Deutschland  reported in a preview of
an article to be published tomorrow, citing an unidentified
spokeswoman for energy distributor Tennet Tso GmbH.  A 220-megawatt generator in Mannheim operated from 7 a.m.
to 5 p.m., while around 500 megawatts of capacity from  Austria 
was also called on, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
