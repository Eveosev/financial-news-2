Ioxus Inc., a closely held
manufacturer of energy-storage devices, purchased Power Systems
Ltd. of  Japan  to gain its thin-cell technology and customers in
Asia.  The purchase is part of Oneonta, New-York-based Ioxus’s
plan to expand in Asia, the company said today in a statement
that didn’t give a price for the deal.  Ioxus’s ultracapacitors can be paired with batteries in
electric cars to capture energy from braking or to store power
generated by solar and wind farms. Power Systems has developed
thin-cell ultracapacitors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
