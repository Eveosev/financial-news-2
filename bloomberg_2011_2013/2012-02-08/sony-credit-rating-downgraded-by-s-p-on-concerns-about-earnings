Sony Corp. (6758) , which widened its loss
forecast for the current fiscal year, had its credit  rating
lowered  one level by  Standard & Poor’s  because of falling
prices, waning demand and tougher competition.  The long-term ratings were lowered to “BBB+,” S&P’s
third-lowest investment grade, from “A-,” the ratings company
said in a statement today. The outlook was set at “negative,”
reflecting a view that the ratings may be cut further in the
absence of a sign of recovery in earnings, S&P said.  The announcement follows downgrades by Moody’s Investors
Service and Fitch Ratings in the past two months on concern the
Japanese electronics maker will have difficulty turning around
its unprofitable  television business . Last week, Sony more than
 doubled  its annual loss forecast to 220 billion yen ($2.9
billion), blaming a stronger yen, production setbacks caused by
floods in Thailand and the cost of exiting a display-panel
venture with Samsung Electronics Co.  Moody’s assigned Sony “Baa1,” its third-lowest investment
grade, while Fitch gave a “BBB-” rating, one level above junk.  Panasonic Corp., Sony’s closest domestic rival, had its
rating cut to the same level as Sony by Fitch on Feb. 6. Fitch
said it had a “negative” outlook on Panasonic because of weak
economic conditions and competition with South Korean companies.  Earlier this week, Moody’s said it will monitor Sony’s
strategies for improving profitability, particularly in its TV
business, while reiterating its ratings on Sony.  To contact the reporter on this story:
