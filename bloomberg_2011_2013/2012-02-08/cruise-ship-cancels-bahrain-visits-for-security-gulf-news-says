The luxury cruise ship Aida Blu has
temporarily canceled visits to Bahrain for security reasons,
 Gulf Daily News  reported today, citing the company that runs the
liner.  A spokeswoman for the cruise ship company Aida said from
Rostock,  Germany  that the ship had canceled visits for two
weeks, the paper said. Aidaâ€™s press office confirmed the report
when contacted by Bloomberg.  Shiite Muslim demonstrators have stepped up protests ahead
of the Feb. 14 anniversary of anti-government rallies that the
Sunni-led government quashed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
