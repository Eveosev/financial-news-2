Semiconductor Manufacturing
International Corp. , a circuit-chip maker based in  Shanghai ,
jumped the most in three months in New York after saying first-
quarter sales will increase from the October-December period.  The company’s American depositary receipts  advanced  4.2
percent to $2.73 by 10:10 a.m. in New York. They earlier surged
7.6 percent, the biggest intraday gain since Nov. 2.  Semiconductor’s revenue for the first quarter this year
will rise between 7 percent and 9 percent from the last quarter
of 2011, the company said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange today. Analysts had forecast a decline.  Four-quarter sales declined 5.6 percent from the previous
three months to $289.6 million, the company said. That was lower
than the $296.1 million average  estimate  of seven analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
