TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP) , the online travel-
recommendation service spun off from  Expedia (EXPE)  Inc. in December,
said fourth-quarter profit rose 19 percent as advertising
revenue rose.  Net income climbed to $22 million, or 16 cents a share,
from $18.4 million, or 14 cents, a year earlier, the Newton,
Massachusetts-based company said today in its first quarterly
report as an independent company. Revenue jumped 30 percent to
$137.8 million.  Expedia separated TripAdvisor from its main online travel
agency to let shareholders own stakes directly in faster-growing
TripAdvisor. Expedia, which reports fourth-quarter results
tomorrow, has struggled to compete with  Priceline Inc.’s (PCLN) 
international growth, while advertising revenue at TripAdvisor
has been rising.  In the fourth quarter, $37.5 million, or 27 percent of
TripAdvisor revenue, came from Expedia. That compared with $36.5
million, or 34 percent, a year earlier.  TripAdvisor, which has 19 travel and advertising brands,
operates in 30 countries and has 50 million users a month
visiting the site to research and plan trips, according to
company figures.  John Malone ’s Liberty Media Corp. is the biggest
shareholder in Expedia and TripAdvisor, owning about 22 percent
of each. The spinoff has worked for Malone so far.  TripAdvisor (TRIP) 
has gained 25 percent since it first started trading on Dec. 7,
while Expedia has jumped 22 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index has risen 7.1 percent.  TripAdvisor fell 1.4 percent to $34.34 at the close in  New
York , before the release of the financial report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
