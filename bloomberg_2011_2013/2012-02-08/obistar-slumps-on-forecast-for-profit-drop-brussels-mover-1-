Mobistar SA ,  Belgium ’s second-biggest
mobile-phone company, fell to the lowest value in eight and a
half years in Brussels trading after forecasting a decline in
profit will accelerate this year, missing analysts’ estimates.  Mobistar declined as much as 9.6 percent, the most in three
years, and  traded  down 3.67 euros at 36.72 euros by 9:37 a.m.
local time. A close at this price would be lowest since July
2003. Net income will drop to 182.5 million euros ($242.4
million), plus or minus 12.5 million euros, the Brussels-based
company said today in a statement. That compares with analyst
projections for 2012 profit of 220.8 million euros, the average
of 13  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Regulation will erase an additional 51 million euros from
sales this year and Mobistar doesn’t expect to fully make up for
the loss, forecasting a  revenue drop  of as much as 2 percent,
after a decline in Belgian wireless service revenue unexpectedly
accelerated in the fourth quarter. The phone company cut its
 dividend  14 percent to 3.70 euros a share, following a 5.5
percent reduction a year earlier.  “The guidance is substantially below consensus, which
increases risk of further dividend cuts,” Emmanuel Carlier, an
analyst at ING Groep NV in Brussels, wrote in an investor note.
“The weaker-than-expected service revenues potentially indicate
the impact of mobile voice cannibalization.”  Prepaid Clients  Mobistar lost 8,800 Belgian customers in the fourth
quarter, with more prepaid clients defecting than it gained
subscribers on monthly contracts. The mobile-phone company added
61,500 users of its network through so-called mobile virtual
network operators and won 1,200 additional customers in
Luxembourg.  The phone company that’s  controlled  by  France Telecom SA (FTE) 
also said it will continue to invest in its unprofitable TV and
broadband offering, seeking access to Belgacom SA’s VDSL
technology or cable operators’ networks.  Mobistar’s  fixed-line  business posted an operating loss of
46.7 million euros last year and Mobistar’s Starpack offering
combining satellite TV, telephony services and broadband
Internet had only 34,194 subscribers by year-end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
