European Union governments are moving
toward stiffer sanctions on  Syria , including a freeze on the
central bank’s assets and a ban on imports of phosphates and
precious metals, an EU official said.  A consensus exists in the 27-nation bloc to toughen the
sanctions against President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, with
details to be ironed out in time for approval on Feb. 27 by EU
foreign ministers, the official told reporters in Brussels today
on condition of anonymity.  Taking sanctions on  Iran ’s central bank as a model, the EU
is working to craft the Syrian monetary curbs so as not to
hobble Syria’s trade completely, the official said.  A cutoff of phosphates imports will shut down a key source
of revenue for the regime because Syria relies on European
customers for 40 percent of its phosphates sales, the official
said.  The official gave no figures for Syria’s income from gold
and other precious metals slated for the ban.  By contrast, a proposal by one EU government for a ban on
commercial flights to and from Syria has found little support,
said the official. He didn’t identify the government behind the
idea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
