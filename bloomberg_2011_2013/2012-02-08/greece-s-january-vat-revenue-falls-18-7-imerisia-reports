The Greek government’s revenue from
value-added tax totaled 1.85 billion euros ($2.45 billion) last
month, an 18.7 percent decline compared with January 2011,
mainly because of increased company closures,  Imerisia  reported.  Revenue from vehicle road tax, at 1.2 billion euros, showed
no marked decline, even as more motorists returned their number
plates so as not to pay the tax, the Athens-based newspaper
reported, without saying how it got the information.  Total revenue fell by 6 percent to 7 percent, Imerisia
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
