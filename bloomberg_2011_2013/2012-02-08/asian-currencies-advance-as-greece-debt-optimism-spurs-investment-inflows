Asian currencies gained for a second
day, led by  Thailand ’s baht, on speculation Greece is making
progress in efforts to secure additional international aid.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index approached the
highest level since September as exchange data showed global
funds poured $3.9 billion this month into Indian, South Korean,
Taiwanese and Thai stocks. Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos 
is scheduled to meet the heads of three political parties today
after government officials held “constructive” talks with
private bondholders, according to a statement yesterday from the
International Institute of Finance.  “The Greek progress has lifted market sentiment as people
see a glimpse of hope now,” said Stella Lee, president of
Success Futures & Foreign Exchange Ltd. in  Hong Kong .  The baht rallied 0.6 percent to a three-month high of 30.76
per dollar as of 3:42 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Philippine peso climbed 0.4 percent
to 42.22 and  Indonesia ’s rupiah gained 0.5 percent to 8,943. The
Asia Dollar  Index (ADXY) , which tracks the 10 most-traded currencies in
the region excluding the yen, rose 0.2 percent.  Pacific Investment Management Co., which runs the world’s
largest bond fund, sees Asian currencies gaining support as
near-zero U.S.  interest rates  fuel demand for higher-yielding
assets, Ramin Toloui, the company’s global co-head for  emerging
markets , said in an interview in Hong Kong yesterday. Last
month, the  Federal Reserve  signaled it will keep rates near zero
through late 2014.  Support From China  “Fund flows into bonds and stocks are a very important
factor for Asian currencies,” said Amonthep Chawla, a Bangkok-
based analyst at Kasikornbank Pcl. “We still have some risk
factors because  Greece  hasn’t yet finished talks.”  China may “move shortly” to help  Europe  resolve its debt
crisis by providing an investment of as much as 100 billion
euros ($133 billion) to its bailout fund, Yuan Gangming, an
economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said in an
interview in Beijing on Feb. 6.  South Korea’s won closed 0.3 percent stronger at 1,115.70
per dollar to approach a three-month high while the rupiah was
headed for its best gain in two weeks. The two nations’ central
banks meet tomorrow to set interest rates.  Rate Decisions  The Bank of Korea will hold its seven-day repurchase rate
at 3.25 percent, according to 18 of 19 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. One predicts a reduction to 3 percent. Bank
Indonesia will maintain its  reference rate  at 6 percent, 11 of
15 economists in a separate survey forecast, while four expect a
cut to 5.75 percent.  China ’s yuan appreciated 0.17 percent to 6.2945 per dollar
at the close in Shanghai, near an 18-year high of 6.2919 set on
Jan. 4. The People’s Bank of China set its fixing 0.14 percent
stronger today, the most since Dec. 30, before Vice President Xi
Jinping visits Washington next week.  “The yuan’s reference rate is likely to stay strong, if
not strengthen further, in the next few days,” said Lee at
Success Futures & Foreign Exchange. “It could facilitate
peaceful bilateral talks.”  Elsewhere, India’s rupee rose 0.2 percent to 49.1350 per
dollar and Malaysia’s ringgit gained 0.2 percent to 3.0020 as
financial markets reopened this week after two holidays.
Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.1 percent to NT$29.53 and  Vietnam ’s
dong added 0.2 percent to 20,925.  To contact the reporter on this story:
