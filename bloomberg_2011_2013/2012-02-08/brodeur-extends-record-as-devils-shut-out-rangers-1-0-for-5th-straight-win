Martin Brodeur had 30 saves on his
way to a National Hockey League record-extending 117th career
shutout as the  New Jersey Devils  beat the New York Rangers 1-0.  David Clarkson’s power-play goal midway through the first
period last night at Madison Square Garden in New York gave the
Devils their fifth straight victory.  The Rangers lead the five-team Eastern Conference’s
Atlantic Division from the  Philadelphia Flyers  and the Devils.  Goalie Henrik Lundqvist had 21 saves for New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
