Roger Altman , chairman of  Evercore
Partners Inc. (EVR)  and a former U.S. deputy treasury secretary, said
the U.S. recovery has been “profoundly weak” and may pose a
challenge to President Barack Obama’s election campaign.  “The most noteworthy thing about the U.S. recovery so far
has been its weakness,” Altman said at an event hosted by think
tank Chatham House in London today. “American households are
still in the midst of a long-term deleveraging exercise” and
“the U.S. labor market is weaker than it looks.”  While the  unemployment rate  fell to a three-year low of 8.3
percent last month, Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said yesterday that the decline veils weaknesses in the U.S.
labor market. Obama’s approval rating has climbed to 50 percent
and a majority of voters for the first time favor him over
former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, according to a
Washington Post/ABC News poll published Feb. 6.  “It’s too early really to read polls, but the economy will
be the primary determinant of the outcome of our elections in
November,” Altman said. He cited Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s
prediction for a year-end  jobless rate  of 9 percent and said if
that materializes, “it will be a very close and difficult
election for the president.”  Altman, who served under President  Bill Clinton , said the
U.S. needs “more growth” and “actually could use more
stimulus.” He also said the outlook this year is “only
modestly better” than 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
