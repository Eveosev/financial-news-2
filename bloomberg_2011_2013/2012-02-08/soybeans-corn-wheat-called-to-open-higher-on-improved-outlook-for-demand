What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel higher
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that dry weather
curbing production in Argentina and  Brazil  will prompt Chinese
importers to buy more from the U.S.,  Don Roose , the president of
U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa , said in a
telephone interview.  Soybean-oil  futures are expected to open
0.35 cent to 0.4 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal futures
may open 50 cents to $1 higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
higher in Chicago on speculation that a U.S. government report
tomorrow will confirm smaller crops in  South America , boosting
global demand for U.S. inventories, Roose said.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that cold weather later this week
may damage crops in Russia and Ukraine, Roose said.
