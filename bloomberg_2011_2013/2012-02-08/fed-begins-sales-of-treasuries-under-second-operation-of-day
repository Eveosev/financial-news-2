The  Federal Reserve  began selling
Treasuries as part of its program to replace $400 billion of
short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in
an effort to reduce borrowing costs.  The central bank listed $8 billion to $8.75 billion of
securities maturing from June 2013 to November 2013 for sale
between 10:15 a.m. and 11 a.m. New York time, according to a
Federal Reserve Bank of New York statement  today . It purchased
$1.813 billion of notes due in 2036 to 2041 earlier today.  The Fed is purchasing longer-maturity Treasuries and
selling a similar amount of shorter-term debt under a monetary
stimulus plan thatâ€™s become known as Operation Twist.  To contact the reporter on this story:
