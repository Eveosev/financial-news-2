Citigroup Inc. , the third-biggest U.S.
bank by assets, named Rodrigo Zorrilla chief operating officer
for Asia-Pacific as part of a management shuffle under a single
chief for the region.  Anthony Nappi was appointed chief administrative officer,
according to a company memo obtained by Bloomberg News today.
Michael Zink was put in charge of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations area.  James Griffiths , a Hong Kong-based spokesman
for Citigroup, confirmed the contents of the document.  The moves follow the appointment of  Stephen Bird  as sole
chief executive officer for the bank’s Asia Pacific operations
at the start of the year, a position he previously shared. New
York-based Citigroup is expanding operations in the region, this
week becoming the second foreign bank to be allowed to issue
credit cards in  China .  Nadir Mahmud, Asia head of local markets and foreign
exchange strategy, will take over Zorrilla’s previous job as
head of markets for the region, the memo said. The replacement
for Nappi, previously the area’s head of global transaction
services, will be announced later, the memo said.  “This structures creates clear leadership accountability
and enhances communication alignment against Citi’s global
growth priorities in a region that is core to Citi and generated
over a third of the bank’s global profit in 2011,” Griffiths
said.  The appointments follow a similar shuffle last week for
Europe, Middle East and Africa, where the bank has also
reorganized management under a single CEO, Michael Corbat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
