Russia’s Federal Market Service
questioned billionaire Alexey Mordashov on why he failed to make
a mandatory offer to minority shareholders of OAO Power Machines
after obtaining more than 95 percent of the company’s stock,
 Kommersant  reported today.  Mordashov’s Highstat Ltd. was ordered to comply with the
law, the newspaper said, citing Dmitry Pankin, who heads the
regulator.  Mordashov, whose biggest asset is a controlling stake in
OAO Severstal, bought 29.7 percent of Power Machines, a St.
Petersburg-based turbine maker, from Siemens AG last year. Power
Machines then lost its listing on the Russian stock exchange.  Highstat should have made an offer to minorities by
Jan. 5, Kommersant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
