Spain  added 4 billion euros ($5.3
billion) in the re-opening of its benchmark 10-year bonds,
according to a banker involved in the transaction.  The additional 5.85 percent bonds due 2022 yield 300 basis
points, or 3 percentage points, more than the swap rate, said
the banker, who declined to be identified because the
information is private. The notes take the total size of the
benchmark issue to 11.3 billion euros, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Spain’s 10-year bond yields have declined about 40 basis
points since the European Central Bank started making three-year
loans to banks in December, a measure Spanish Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  says is helping the bond market.  “Spain has now completed about 29% of its issuance program
for 2012, placing it among the most advanced sovereigns,” said
Ciaran O’Hagan, the Paris-based head of euro-area rate strategy
at Societe Generale SA. “That will help to reduce concerns
about the financing of its deficit for this year.”  The 10-year  yield  rose to 5.22 percent on the secondary
market at 6:04 p.m. in Madrid, after falling to as low as 5.05
percent. The yield was 5.07 percent yesterday.  Barclays Capital,  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,
Deutsche Bank AG,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  Banco Santander SA (SAN) 
and Societe Generale managed the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
