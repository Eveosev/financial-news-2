INA Industrija Nafte d.d. , a Croatian
refiner controlled by  Hungary ’s  Mol Nyrt ., said it will import
gas from Hungary after stormy weather cut its natural gas
production in the northern Adriatic.  The Zagreb-based company will import around 2 million cubic
meters of the fuel a day from members of the Mol group,  INA  said
in an e-mailed statement today. It gave no details on the
duration of the arrangement. Heavy snow storms reduced INA’s
Adriatic production to 1.3 million cubic meters a day from 3.3
million cubic meters, the company said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
