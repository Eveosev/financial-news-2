Ericsson AB, the world’s largest
maker of wireless networks, was sued for more than $330 million
by Airvana Network Solutions Inc., which says Ericsson
misappropriated intellectual property.  Ericsson secretly developed a product based on Airvana
trade secrets to operate wireless  network equipment  to avoid
paying software licensing fees, Airvana said in a complaint
filed today in New York state  Supreme Court .  “Ericsson has now undertaken a blatant ploy to evade its
contractual obligations, by developing a secret ‘in-house’
project designed to misappropriate critical Airvana intellectual
property,” the company said.  Ericsson, which depended on Airvana’s technology to service
customers, “constantly badgered” Airvana to reduce the price
of the software and began development of its own product in
2010, according to the complaint.  Airvana, based in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, said it has
suffered damages of more than $330 million and will face “an
immediate and precipitous decline” in revenue if Ericsson is
able to displace the company with its own product.  A spokesman for Ericsson, based in  Stockholm , couldn’t be
reached for comment.  The case is Airvana Network Solutions Inc. v. Ericsson
Inc., 650360-2012, New York state Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
