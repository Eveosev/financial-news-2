The European Financial Stability
Facility’s Deputy Chief Executive Officer Christophe Frankel
said the fund will “probably” be involved in  Greece ’s private
sector debt writedown and the country’s second bailout package.  “We are now waiting for the” private-sector involvement
and “new program for Greece to be finalized,” Frankel said at
a conference in  London  today. “The EFSF will probably play a
significant role in both.”  He didn’t elaborate how the fund would be involved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
