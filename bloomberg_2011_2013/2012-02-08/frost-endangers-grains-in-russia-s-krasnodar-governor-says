Most winter grains in  Russia ’s
southern Krasnodar region, which accounted for about 12 percent
of last year’s national harvest, are at risk from frost,
according to the local governor.  Fields in central Krasnodar are in particular danger as
they lack snow deep enough to protect crops, Alexander Tkachev
said yesterday at a meeting, according to a  statement  posted on
the regional administration’s website. Temperatures reached
minus 25 degrees Celsius (minus 13 degrees Fahrenheit) this
month and will stay around minus 20 degrees Celsius, it showed.  The region suffered crop losses before winter started,
worsening current conditions, according to the statement. It
cited “abnormally early frosts registered in October” that
kept crops from strengthening.  Krasnodar’s grain crop came to 11.4 million metric tons
last year, according to government statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
