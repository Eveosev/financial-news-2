New Jersey (STONJ1)  Governor Chris Christie
said he’s hopeful that a proposal by the Democratic leader of
the state Senate to end cash payouts to public workers for
unused sick time will end in a deal.  Senate President  Stephen Sweeney , of West Deptford,
introduced a bill to prohibit public workers from cashing in
unused sick time beyond what they’ve already accumulated.
Christie, a Republican, said his staff and Sweeney’s are
discussing “minor changes” to the bill, which differs from
past Democratic proposals to cap the payouts at a specific
amount.  “I’m very encouraged by Senator Sweeney’s bill and once
again he’s taken a very courageous step forward,” Christie, 49,
told reporters today after a town-hall meeting in Westfield.
“We’ve gotten to the core of something I can be very encouraged
about.”  Christie vetoed a Democrat-sponsored bill in 2010 that
would have limited the payments to $15,000. He also rejected a
version with a $7,500 maximum, saying it would cost taxpayers
$3.25 billion if all current state and local employees retired.  To contact the reporter on this story:
