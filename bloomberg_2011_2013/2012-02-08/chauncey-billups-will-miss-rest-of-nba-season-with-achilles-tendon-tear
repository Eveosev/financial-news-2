Los Angeles  Clippers guard Chauncey Billups will miss the remainder of the National Basketball
Association season with a torn Achilles tendon.  Billups, 35, injured his left ankle when he slipped with
five minutes, 48 seconds left in the fourth quarter of a 107-102
overtime victory against the  Orlando Magic  on Feb. 6.  Billups, who left the game with 18 points, had a scan
yesterday in Cleveland and will return to Los Angeles tomorrow
for additional evaluation before surgery is scheduled, the team
said on its website last night.  “I’m most definitely not retiring,” Billups  told ESPN  in
a telephone interview. “The way my career has gone and the body
of work I’ve put in, I definitely want to walk out on both feet.
I don’t want to go out like this.”  Billups averaged 14.9 points, four assists and 2.5 rebounds
in 20 games this season.  The Clippers (15-7) hold a 2 1/2-game lead over the  Los
Angeles Lakers  atop the Western Conference’s five-team Pacific
Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
