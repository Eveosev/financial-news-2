McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s largest
restaurant chain, said sales at stores open at least 13 months
rose 6.7 percent globally last month as beverages and Chicken
McBites helped the U.S. business.  Analysts projected a gain of 5.8 percent, the average of
six estimates compiled by Bloomberg News. Sales in the U.S.
advanced 7.8 percent, the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said
today in a statement. Analysts estimated a gain of 7.1 percent.  Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner has boosted sales in
the U.S. by keeping restaurants open longer; about 40 percent of
stores now operate 24 hours a day. The chain has recently
promoted classic items such as the Big Mac and Chicken McNuggets
as well as a McRib sandwich and Chicken McBites at its U.S.
locations, which generate about one-third of company  revenue .  “They’re probably taking share from some of their peers,
including Burger King,” Peter Saleh, a New York-based analyst
at Telsey Advisory Group, said in an interview. They may also be
taking business from  Sonic Corp. (SONC)  and  Wendy’s Co. (WEN)  because
McDonald’s stores are “newer and more up-to-date,” he said.  McDonald’s will spend about $1.45 billion to remodel and
modernize more than 2,400 restaurants this year globally,
Skinner said during a  conference call  in January. In 2011, the
company remodeled 2,500 stores.  Sales rose 4 percent in  Europe  and 7.3 percent in  Asia ,
Africa and the  Middle East . Analysts estimated growth of 4
percent at McDonald’s stores in Europe and 6 percent in Asia,
Africa and the Middle East.  McDonald’s fell 0.9 percent to $100.05 at the close in  New
York . The  shares  climbed 31 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
