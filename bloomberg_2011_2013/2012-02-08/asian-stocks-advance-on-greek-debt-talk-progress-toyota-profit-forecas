     Feb. 8 (Bloomberg) --  Asian stocks  rose for a third day as
 Greece ’s government edged closer to securing a bailout package
and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  raised its profit forecast. Chinese
shares rallied ahead reports tomorrow that are expected to show
inflation easing.  Toyota rallied 5 percent in Tokyo after Asia’s largest

boosted sales.  China  Petroleum & Chemical Corp. and PetroChina
Co. climbed in Hong Kong after China raised fuel prices for the
first time in 10 months. Rio Tinto Group gained 1.1 percent in

or form, which will provide certainty,” said  Tim Schroeders ,

people are more comfortable in allocating toward risk assets.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  climbed 1.1 percent and
the broader Topix Index added 1.2 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng
Index all rallied 1.5 percent.  The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index advanced 2.4
percent amid speculation that inflation reports tomorrow will

ease monetary policy. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.4
percent and South Korea’s Kospi Index advanced 1.1 percent.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little

recouping losses of as much as 0.6 percent, as Greece made
progress on measures to secure international aid.  Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos postponed a meeting
with heads of political parties supporting his government a
second time in as many days as he continued to haggle with
international creditors over terms to secure aid.  Troika Meeting  Papademos instead met with the so-called troika, comprising
the European Commission, the  European Central Bank  and the
 International Monetary Fund , to put the final touches on terms
required for a 130 billion-euro ($172 billion) rescue package, a
spokeswoman said. He will meet with the leaders of the political
parties in  Athens  today.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  extended a five-month high
yesterday, rising 0.1 percent. The gauge climbed 9.8 percent
this year through yesterday as U.S. economic data added to

from  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Toyota rallied 5 percent, its biggest increase in almost 11
months, to 3,135 yen after the carmaker raised its profit

record number of global vehicle sales in 2012.  BYD’s Surge  BYD Co., the Chinese carmaker partly owned by Warren
