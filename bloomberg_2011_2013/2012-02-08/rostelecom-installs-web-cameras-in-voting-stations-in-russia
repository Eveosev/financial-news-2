OAO Rostelecom (RTKM) ,  Russia ’s biggest
fixed-line telephone service provider, said it installed the
first 15,000 sets of web cameras for the March presidential
elections following the government’s promise to eliminate any
possibility of ballot-stuffing.  Web cameras are to be installed in 91,400 voting stations,
Rostelecom said in an e-mailed  statement  today, allowing a total
of 25 million users to view the broadcast on
 http://www.webvybory2012.ru . Russian companies  Sitronics (SITR)  and
Kraftway produced the equipment for the project, Rostelecom
said.  Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  offered in December
to put web cameras in all polling stations to counter charges of
fraud in the March 4 presidential elections.  The cost of the project may reach 30 billion rubles ($1
billion), with the government paying 13 billion rubles and
Rostelecom covering the rest of the cost, Interfax reported on
Jan. 13, citing Deputy Communications Minister Ilya Massukh.  Rostelecom is to install a total of 300,000 devices in
voting stations throughout the country, the Kommersant newspaper
reported Dec. 20, citing Massukh.  To contact the reporter on this story:
