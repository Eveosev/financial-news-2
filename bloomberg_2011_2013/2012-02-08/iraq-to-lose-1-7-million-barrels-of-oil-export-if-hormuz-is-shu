Iraq  will lose the capacity to export
1.7 million barrels of crude a day if Iran blocks the Strait of
Hormuz, the transit point for about two thirds of its
production, an Oil Ministry spokesman said.  “Iraq will have to depend on the northern route from where
it can export 450,000 barrels a day through Turkey’s port of
Ceyhan on the Mediterranean,”  Asim Jihad  said in a telephone
interview in Baghdad. “Crude prices are estimated to rise
significantly if Iran implements its threats to close Hormuz,
and Iraq can compensate for some of its losses if its export
route from the south is closed,” he said.  The Gulf state is pursuing plans to open new crude export
routes via neighboring Syria, following threats by Iran to close
the Strait of Hormuz in response to international sanctions on
its energy industry,  Thamir Ghadhban , the Iraqi prime minister’s
top adviser, said Feb. 2.  Iraq has awarded 15 licenses for drilling rights to foreign
companies since the U.S.-led invasion that ousted President
 Saddam Hussein  in 2003. The Arab nation is the third-largest oil
producer in OPEC, pumping 2.75 million barrels a day in January,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.  -With assistance from Nayla Razzouk. Editors: Raj Rajendran,
