Colombia ’s peso rose to a five-month
high on bets the central bank’s efforts to ease gains in the
currency won’t be enough amid rising foreign direct investment
and increased appetite for the nation’s financial assets.  The peso gained 0.2 percent to 1,779.30 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,782.10 yesterday. Earlier it touched 1,774.90, the
strongest intraday level since Sept. 1. The peso has jumped 9
percent this year.  In a bid to stem the peso’s advance, Colombia’s central
bank said last week that starting Feb. 6 it will buy a minimum
of $20 million a day for at least three months.  “ Risk aversion  has fallen and given all the liquidity in
global markets and Colombia’s good fiscal figures, the central
bank’s measures aren’t enough to counter the appreciation
pressures,” said  Andres Pardo , the head analyst at financial
services holding company Corp. Financiera Colombiana, known as
Corficolombiana.  Colombia is helping keep the peso competitive by avoiding
bringing dollars into the country, including at least $1 billion
in dividends from oil producer Ecopetrol SA, Finance Minister
Juan Carlos Echeverry said today in a conference call with
investors. The peso is rallying as foreign investment is being
drawn into Colombia by booms in mining and oil, he said.  “What we have seen over the last month or month and a half
worries me,” Echeverry said. “We can’t risk losing lots of
jobs because of the currency.”  Budget Deficit  Colombia’s consolidated budget deficit, which includes
states, municipalities and state-run companies, was 2.2 percent
of gross domestic product last year, lower than the government’s
December estimate of 2.9 percent, as economic growth boosts  tax
revenue , Echeverry said.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso bonds due
July 2024 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
7.41 percent, according to the central bank. The bond’s price
fell 0.122 centavo to 120.4860 centavos per peso.  The nation’s borrowing costs rose at an auction of fixed-
rate securities today. The government sold peso bonds due August
2026 to yield 7.62 percent, the  Finance Ministry  said in a
statement, up from 7.49 percent at the last auction on Jan. 25.
Colombia also sold bonds due October 2018 to yield 6.89 percent,
the same yield at the previous auction, while the yield on the
October 2015 securities rose to 6.42 percent from 6.28 percent,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
