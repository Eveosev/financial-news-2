U.S. stocks advanced, pushing the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a seven-month high, as Greek
Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  began talks with political
leaders on terms required for a bailout.  Financial and technology shares gained the most in the  S&P
500  among 10 groups.  Bank of America Corp.  rallied 3.6 percent
to the highest price since Aug. 31. Hartford Financial Services
Group Inc. rose 7.6 percent as billionaire investor  John Paulson 
said the insurer needs to take “drastic” action to reverse its
decline.  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  jumped 3.2 percent at 4:09 p.m.  New
York  time, extending its gain in regular trading, after
reporting profit and sales that beat analyst estimates.  The S&P 500 added 0.2 percent to 1,349.96 at 4 p.m. New
York time, after dropping as much as 0.4 percent. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  increased 5.75 points, or less than 0.1
percent, to 12,883.95, the highest level since May 2008. The
 Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP)  rose 0.4 percent to 2,915.86, the highest
since  December 2000 .  “There’s just a news vacuum,”  James Paulsen , who helps
oversee about $333 billion as chief investment strategist at
Minneapolis-based Wells Capital Management, said in a telephone
interview. “If you just get  Greece  to come out with anything,
you can actually maybe have people move on. I do think they are
going to come out with some sort of agreement. That would be a
big step forward in dealing with  Europe ’s debt crisis.”  Global stocks entered a bull market as the MSCI All-Country
World Index extended its gain from last year’s low to 20
percent. Papademos began talks with political parties supporting
his government as he works to secure a second aid package.
Greece will pledge permanent spending cuts, including lower
pensions and a 20 percent reduction in minimum wages, according
to the draft of the financing deal.  Earnings Season  The  S&P 500  closed 1 percent away from its peak nine months
ago of 1,363.61, which was the highest level since June 2008.
The index has risen 7.3 percent this year amid better-than-
expected economic data and corporate profits.  Earnings (SPX)  beat
projections at 68 percent of the 304 companies in the S&P 500
that reported quarterly results since Jan. 9, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Be 100 percent in equities,” Laurence D. Fink, chief
executive officer of BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest money
manager, said in a Bloomberg Television interview from  Hong Kong 
today. “I don’t have a view that the world is going to fall
apart, so you need to take on more risk. You need to overcome
all this noise, and there are great values in equities.”  The S&P 500 trades for about  14 times  its companies’
earnings and has been stuck below its five-decade average
multiple of 16.4 since May 2010, the longest stretch since a 13-
year period beginning in 1973.  Banks, Technology  Companies most-tied to economic growth led the gains in the
S&P 500 as measures of financial and  technology  shares added
more than 0.6 percent. Bank of America climbed 3.6 percent, the
most in the Dow, to $8.13.  Hartford (HIG)  jumped 7.6 percent to $20.58. Paulson, a hedge
fund manager who controls the largest stake in Hartford, told
Chief Executive Officer Liam McGee he needs to reverse the
insurer’s stock slide. It declined 39 percent last year and
trades at less than half of the company’s book value, a measure
of assets minus liabilities.  “Hartford needs to do something drastic because the stock
is the  lowest valuation  relative to book value of any major
insurance company,” Paulson said today at a conference call for
analysts and investors held by Hartford. The company hired
advisers to evaluate splitting the life insurance and property-
casualty businesses, Hartford said today.  Cisco’s Results  Cisco added 3.2 percent to $21.08 after the close of
regular trading. Fiscal second-quarter net income rose to $2.18
billion, or 40 cents a share, from $1.52 billion, or 27 cents, a
year earlier. Excluding certain items, earnings were 47 cents.
Sales rose 11 percent to $11.5 billion in the period, which
ended Jan. 28. Analysts had estimated 43 cents in profit and
$11.2 billion in revenue, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Chief Executive Officer  John Chambers  began a turnaround
plan last year, when he cut jobs, eliminated businesses and
refocused on more profitable products. Cisco also boosted its
dividend and got a lift from so-called enterprise customers,
which use its gear in their internal networks. The shares rose
1.1 percent to $20.43 in regular trading before the earnings
report.  Ralph Lauren Corp. rallied 9.2 percent to $171.49. The
retailer of its namesake brand clothing said revenue in the
current fiscal year may gain more than it previously expected.  Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC)  surged 19 percent, the most since
at least 1980, to $31.39. The technology contractor for
governments and companies named Mike Lawrie as its next chief
executive officer as it renegotiates a contract with the U.K.’s
National Health Service.  Energy Shares  A  measure  of energy shares had the biggest decline among 10
industries in the S&P 500 today, falling 0.6 percent.  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM)  lost 0.6 percent to $85.32.  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  slumped 1.6 percent to $2.41 after
reporting widening losses for the first quarter it offered the
Apple Inc. iPhone, signaling the best-selling device may not be
helping Chief Executive Officer Dan Hesse turn around the
carrier’s business.  Moody’s Corp. (MCO)  lost 1.7 percent to $38.31. The owner of the
world’s second-largest provider of credit ratings said fourth-
quarter profit fell  30 percent  as Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis
slowed bond sales around the world, reducing demand for its
services.  Western Union Co. (WU)  tumbled 10 percent, the biggest decline
in the S&P 500, to $17.73. The world’s largest money-transfer
business forecast earnings in 2012 will be no more than $1.75 a
share, less than the average analyst estimate of $1.81.  Bull Market  The  Nasdaq  Composite Index has entered a bull market and
stocks may continue to rally through the end of March, according
to  Louise Yamada , who said in December that equity charts were
signaling further losses.  “The Nasdaq has initiated a new structural bull market,”
Yamada, managing director of Louise Yamada Technical Research
Advisors LLC in New York, said in a radio interview today on
“Bloomberg on the Economy” with Sara Eisen. “We’ve entered
the year with short-term positive signals with the possibility
that we could see a rally through the first quarter.”  Yamada, who worked as a technical analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney, said in a December report that investors may be better
off selling “weaker stocks into strength” after a 14 percent
gain in the S&P 500 since October. She said in November that
evidence the market’s advance will continue hadn’t materialized
and the year-end rally may falter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
