Gervinho scored the only goal as
Ivory Coast beat Mali to set up an  Africa  Cup of Nations final
against Zambia, which upset Ghana 1-0 in the other semifinal.  Arsenal striker Gervinho scored in the 45th minute after a
run from his own half in Libreville, Gabon, last night to send
the Ivorians into the final for the third time.  The Elephants, who hit the goalposts with efforts from
Didier Drogba and Yaya Toure, will return to the Gabon capital
Feb. 12 to face Zambia in the title match. They won Africa’s
biennial soccer championship for the only time in 1992.  “With the failures we’ve had in the past, we understand we
haven’t won it yet,” Ivory Coast coach Francois Zahoui said in
comments on the competition’s website.  Ivory Coast  is yet to allow a goal at the 16-nation event,
which is co-hosted by Gabon and  Equatorial Guinea .  In the other semifinal, Zambia’s Emmanuel Mayuka scored in
the 78th minute to seal the win over four-time champion Ghana,
which reached the quarterfinals of the 2010  World Cup .  Zambia goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene stopped  Asamoah Gyan ’s
penalty kick in the first half in Bata, Equatorial Guinea. Gyan
also missed a spot kick in normal time of the Black Stars’
penalty shootout loss to Uruguay at the World Cup in  South
Africa  19 months ago.  Ghana, which last made the continental final in 1982,
finished with 10 men after Derek Boateng received his second
yellow card in the 84th minute.  Zambia will also be playing in its third Cup of Nations
final, having finished as the runner-up in 1972 and 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
