Long Beach (9309MF) ,  New York (STONY1) , the Long Island
city whose credit rating was cut five levels in December,
declared a fiscal crisis, giving its manager the authority to
reappropriate a $60 million budget after a surge in overtime
costs and a $500,000 payout to a retiring police official.  The City Council voted unanimously in favor of the
resolution during a meeting yesterday. The measure gives Manager
Jack Schnirman until June 30 to use his budget powers to get the
36,000-resident municipality’s finances back in order.
Schnirman, 34, a former  management consultant  with a master’s
degree from  Harvard University , was hired last month.  “We will strike a balance, the numbers will be public and
they’re going to make sense,” Schnirman said at the meeting,
which was webcast.  Midway through the fiscal year ending June 30, eight
departments had exceeded their overtime budgets by almost 41
percent, Schnirman said Jan. 24 in an interview. Since 2006,
overtime costs have gone up $900,000, or 66 percent, he said.  On Dec. 20, Moody’s dropped the city’s rating on $48.3
million of general-obligation bonds to Baa3, the lowest
investment grade, from A1. Earlier that month,  Long Beach , about
30 miles (48 kilometers) east of  Manhattan , borrowed $4.25
million to meet its monthly payroll, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg and an offering statement.  Depleted Reserves  Reserves were depleted by overtime and a $500,000 payment
to retiring Police Commissioner Thomas Sofield Sr., former City
Manager Charles Theofan said in a December interview. Sofield, a
lieutenant and 30-year veteran of the force, was serving as
acting commissioner. His payout, required by a union contract,
included accrued vacation time and unused sick days.  Two other police officers followed, raising the total
retirement payouts for vacation and sick leave to $1.4 million.
The payments are a portion of the $23.3 million the city will
owe its more than 300 workers when they retire, according to an
audit of the last fiscal year released yesterday.  The audit also said the city overestimated its revenue by
about $1 million, and ended the year with a $1.1 million deficit
in its water and sewer funds. Officials then pulled cash from
the city’s general fund, lowering the balance to about $100,000
at the end of the fiscal year.  “In the absence of making decisions about revenue and
expenses in the budget, they overestimated revenue year after
year,” Schnirman said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
