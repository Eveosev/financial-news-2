     Feb. 8 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  shares  rose, with the  Nikkei
225 (NKY)  Stock Average closing above 9,000 for the first time since
October, as Toyota Motor Corp. raised its earnings forecast and
a drop in the yen boosted the outlook for exporters.  Toyota, Japan’s biggest company by revenue, jumped 5
percent.  Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723)  surged 10 percent after a
report it’s in talks to merge chip units with  Panasonic Corp. (6752) 
and  Fujitsu Ltd. (6702)   JFE Holdings Inc. (5411)  led steelmakers higher after
ArcelorMittal, the world’s top maker of the material, forecast
improvement in the first half.  The  Nikkei 225  rose 1.1 percent to 9,015.59 as of 3 p.m. in
Tokyo, its highest close since Oct. 28. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index
gained 1.2 percent to 782.34 with more than four stocks rising
for each that fell. The gauge ended the day at its highest level
since Aug. 8.  “It’s amazing that  Toyota (7203)  is forecasting net income of
200 billion yen even after all of these unusual circumstances --
the earthquake, Thai floods,  Europe ’s debt crisis,” saidMasaru Hamasaki, who helps oversee $24 billion as chief strategist at
Toyota Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “I think we’ll see an
earnings rebound across the auto sector and for manufacturers in
general.”  Automakers Advance  Toyota rose 5 percent to 3,135 yen. The nation’s biggest
carmaker yesterday raised its forecast for full-year net income
to 200 billion yen ($2.6 billion). It plans to roll out 19 new
models in the U.S. and is targeting record global sales. Mazda
surged 7.3 percent to 147 yen after saying it plans a 25 percent
increase in its dealerships in  China , according to a Nikkei
report. The company’s shares fell by about 40 percent last year.  The  Topix (TPX)  has risen 7.4 percent this year even as companies
including Toyota have missed earnings estimates. Of 1,094
companies in the index that have reported since Jan. 9, 219
missed analysts’ estimates while 106 beat them, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Toyota’s stock has risen even after
its forecast fell short of the average analyst estimate by 30
percent, or 85.4 billion yen.  “Investor attention is completely shifting to the next
fiscal year” starting in April, said Yoshihiro Ito, chief
strategist at Okasan Online Securities Co. in  Tokyo . “Unless a
negative surprise is very big, they are buying on the ground
that all bad factors have come out. That’s pushing up Toyota.”  The Topix’s rise has boosted the price of companies on the
measure to 0.94 times estimated book value, up from 0.85 in
November, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A number
below one means investors can buy companies for less than the
value of their assets.  Renesas Rises  Renesas gained 10 percent to 556 yen after the Nikkei
newspaper reported without citing a source that the component
maker, Fujitsu and Panasonic may agree to join their large-scale
chip operations by March 2013. Fujitsu added 2.9 percent to 391
yen, while Panasonic rose 3.3 percent to 657 yen.  Iron and steel makers  led gains among the 33 industry
groups on the Topix. JFE Holdings jumped 6.7 percent to 1,503
yen.  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401)  gained 5.6 percent to 206 yen, and
 Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. (5405)  advanced 5.7 percent to 148 yen.  TBK Co. (7277)  surged 15 percent to 461 yen. The maker of pumps
and brakes boosted its full-year net income forecast 28 percent
to 2.3 billion yen, saying Thailand’s floods had less impact on
its supply chain than expected. It also raised its second-half
dividend to 7 yen per share from 5 yen.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.1 percent
today. The benchmark gauge rose 0.2 percent in  New York 
yesterday as  Greece  made progress on measures to secure
international aid.  Greek Negotiations  Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  postponed a meeting
with heads of political parties supporting his government a
second time in as many days as he continued to haggle with
international creditors over terms to secure aid.  “The Greek debt situation will be resolved in some shape
or form,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion in
equities at Pengana Capital Ltd. in  Melbourne . “By eliminating
part of that downside risk, people are more comfortable in
allocating toward risky assets.”  The yen dropped against all of its 16 major counterparts
today. A weaker yen boosts the value of Japanese exporters’
earnings abroad when repatriated back home.  Exporters to Europe rose.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that
depends on Europe for almost a third of sales, rose 1.5 percent
to 3,445 yen.  Nintendo Co. (7974) , a video-game company that generates
more than a third of its sales in Europe, rose 1.5 percent to
10,710 yen.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index  rose 3.1 percent to 21.01,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 6 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
