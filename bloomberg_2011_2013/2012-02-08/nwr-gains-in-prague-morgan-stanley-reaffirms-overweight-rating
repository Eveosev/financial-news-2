New World Resources Plc , the largest
Czech producer of coking coal, rose as much as 4.5 percent in
Prague trading after Morgan Stanley reiterated an “overweight”
rating on the shares.  NWR closed 3.8 percent higher at 161.85 koruna, bringing
the year’s advance to 19 percent.  The company’s “significant de-rating versus the sector is
overdone” and it presents an “attractive buying opportunity,”
Morgan Stanley said in a report dated Feb. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
