Germany and  Switzerland  should revoke
financial guarantees they gave to some local banks because the
measures could lead to “greater risk-taking,” the Financial
Stability Board said in a report published  on its website .  Such guarantees amount to “unlimited” protection of  bank
deposits  from loss and “should be avoided,” the FSB said in
the report, which examines national programs to protect savers.  The unlimited guarantees apply to German cooperative and
savings banks and some Swiss cantonal lenders, according to the
group, which includes regulators, central bankers and finance
ministry officials from the Group of 20 countries.  Nations rushed to guarantee bank deposits in response to
the worldwide credit crunch that began in 2007 and prevent bank
runs such as that experienced by Northern Rock Plc. Ireland was
criticized by German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  during the crisis
for unilaterally increasing the size of the deposits that it
guaranteed, leading savers to shift accounts from other European
Union nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
