Bahraini police arrested two people
accused of attacking a British man with a sword on Feb. 3, the
Interior Ministry said late yesterday.  The two will appear before the public prosecutor, the
ministry said in a statement, citing the director-general of the
Criminal Investigation Directorate. The attack took place in
Karanah, a Shiite village outside Manama, the capital.  Shiite Muslim demonstrators have stepped up protests ahead
of the Feb. 14 one-year anniversary of anti-government rallies
that the Sunni-led government quashed a month later.  The government is deploying policemen across the country,
Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid bin Abdulla Al Khalifa said in a
statement to lawmakers, Gulf Daily News reported today. Security
at government buildings and other facilities is also being
increased, the newspaper said.  Several suspects accused of burning a police jeep on Feb. 4
have been arrested, the Interior Ministry said in a posting on
Twitter. It said the suspects confessed to the public
prosecutor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
