India  will pay for as much as 45
percent of its crude imports from  Iran  in rupees, the state-run
 Fars  news agency reported, citing Mehdi Nabizadeh, the Gulf
nation’s ambassador to India.  “Indian oil importers are keen to use this method for
paying Iran as they believe the channel of payment through a
Turkish bank may be blocked due to sanctions” against the
Islamic Republic over its nuclear program, Nabizadeh said,
according to Fars.  The proposal, made by India, was accepted by Iran, he said.
The two countries are seeking a solution for payment to be made
for the remaining 55 percent, Nabizadeh said.  Iran’s central bank has opened an account with India’s
government-run UCO Bank to receive payment for its crude exports
to the South Asian nation in rupees, the Financial Chronicle
newspaper said earlier this week, citing unidentified officials.  India and Iran have struggled to protect $9.5 billion in
annual crude trade amid escalating economic and financial
sanctions against Iran. The  Reserve Bank  of India dismantled a
mechanism in December 2010 used to settle payments in euros and
dollars. Transactions are now routed through Turkiye Halk
Bankasi AS, based in Ankara, which has told Indian refiners it
may no longer be able to act as an intermediary, four people
with knowledge of the matter said Jan. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
