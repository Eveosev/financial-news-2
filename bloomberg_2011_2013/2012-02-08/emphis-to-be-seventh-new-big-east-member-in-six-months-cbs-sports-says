The University of  Memphis  will join
the  Big East  in all sports in 2013, becoming the conference’s
seventh new member in six months,  CBSSports.com reported .  The Conference USA school said on its website that a  news
conference  has been scheduled for today on campus “to discuss
the future of University of Memphis Tiger athletics.”  The move would come two weeks after the U.S. Naval Academy
said it will join the Big East in football. It would give the
Providence, Rhode Island-based Big East -- one of six
conferences whose champion gets an automatic berth in a Bowl
Championship Series postseason game -- 13 football teams by 2015.  Pittsburgh and Syracuse left the  Big East  for the Atlantic
Coast Conference in September, followed shortly after by  West
Virginia ’s announcement that it plans to join the Big 12. The
conference also lost Texas Christian, which backtracked on a
plan to join the Big East and jumped instead to the  Big 12 .  The Big East has responded by adding Navy, Boise State and
San Diego State for football, as well as Southern Methodist,
Central Florida and Houston for all sports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
