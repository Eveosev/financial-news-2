Inflation in the  Philippines  is
likely to slow later this year and expectations of interest-rate
increases may be excessive, Dow Jones reported, citing an
interview with Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima.  The economy will expand by between 5.5 percent and 6
percent this year and the local currency will tend to strengthen
on capital inflows, the news service cited Purisima as saying in
 Washington . Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ quarter-percentage-
point increase in the benchmark overnight borrowing rate last
month may be sufficient for now, he told Dow Jones.  Purisima is a member of the central bank’s Monetary Board.
It next meets on May 5, the same day the statistics office will
report inflation data for April.  To contact the reporter for this story:
