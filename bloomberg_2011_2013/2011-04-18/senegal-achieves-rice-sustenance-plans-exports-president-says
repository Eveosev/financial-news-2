Senegal  is producing enough rice to
meet domestic needs and export the surplus, President Abdoulaye
Wade said.  Last year’s harvest was 640,000 metric tons of rice, 40,000
tons more domestic demand, Wade said at a conference in the
capital of Dakar today. The yield was more than triple that of
2006, he said. A program with  India  will boost production to 1.1
million tons in a few years, he said.  “We’re going to produce 600,000 tons for local consumption
and have a further 500,000 tons for export,” he said.  Senegal produced a record 1.286 million tons of peanuts
last year, Wade said. Peanuts account for 60 percent of the
country’s agricultural exports, according to the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture . The state sets farm gate prices at 165 West
African CFA (35 cents) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) during the
December to May harvest. The Agriculture Ministry plans to
extend the set price outside the harvest to support farmers, he
said. Peanut oil exports by Senegal’s Suneor, the country’s
biggest peanut-oil processing company, account for as much as
half of world supply, according to a 2007 report by the USDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
