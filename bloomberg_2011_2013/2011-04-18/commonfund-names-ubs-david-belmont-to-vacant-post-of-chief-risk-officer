Commonfund, which oversees more
than $26 billion for endowments, pension funds and foundations,
named David Belmont chief risk officer, succeeding William Martin, who left in December.  Belmont was the global head of hedge-fund credit at Zurich-
based UBS AG and before that was the chief risk officer at
Temasek Holdings Pte, the Singapore state investment company,
Commonfund said today in a statement from Wilton,  Connecticut .
He will report to Chief Executive Officer Verne Sedlacek.  Martin, who joined the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, was
one of at least three top executives to leave the firm in the
last year. Chief Investment Officer Lyn Hutton resigned in
October and Timothy Shine, who ran the real estate group, left
that month after a $1 billion property fund lost most of its
value. In February, Commonfund named Frederic Nelson of ING
Investment Management Americas as Hutton’s replacement.  Commonfund, which is courting public pensions and expanding
its asset-management group for school funds, stopped direct
property investments after the declines at Commonfund Realty
Investors. The firm wrote down the fund’s holdings to close to
zero as capital markets tumbled in the aftermath of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.’s September 2008 bankruptcy, two people
briefed on the results said in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
