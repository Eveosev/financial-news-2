Cargill Inc. took delivery of a
“large quantity” of the white, or refined, sugar after the
expiration of the May futures contract on NYSE Liffe.  The amount was about 323,750 metric tons, Cargill spokesman
Francis DeRosa said by e-mail today. The total delivery from the
contract expiration was 375,150 tons, the most since May 2007,
according to NYSE Liffe and data on Bloomberg.  White sugar has climbed 28 percent in the past year on
speculation the crop in  Brazil , the world’s largest producer,
will be delayed. The European Union allowed extra imports
because of a domestic shortage.  The sugar is being used “to help us supply our sales
programs to our customers,” DeRosa said in the e-mail.  Cargill, based in  Minnetonka ,  Minnesota , in March took
delivery of almost 1 million tons of raw sugar on ICE Futures
U.S. in  New York , the biggest for ICE since 2009. A unit of
JPMorgan Chase & Co. handled the purchase.  Almost all of the NYSE Liffe sugar delivered, or 370,000
tons, came from Thailand, according to the exchange. Another
5,150 tons came from  Guatemala , it said.  “It is not usual to expect Thai whites to be delivered,”
Nick Penney, an analyst at Sucden Financial said in an e-mail.
“They usually trade at a premium to the market.”  White sugar for May delivery expired at a premium of $66 a
ton above the August contract, Bloomberg data shows. The August
futures contract fell $10.70, or 1.7 percent, today to $622 a
ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporters on this story:
