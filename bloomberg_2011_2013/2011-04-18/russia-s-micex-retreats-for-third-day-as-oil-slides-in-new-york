Russian stocks tumbled the most in
more than nine months as oil fell and the U.S.’s debt ratings
outlook was revised to negative from stable by  Standard &
Poor’s , curbing demand for riskier assets.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  of 30 stocks lost 3.7 percent to 1,714.07
at the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest decline since July
1. OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s biggest lender, dropped 6 percent to
100.07 rubles, its sharpest retreat since July 1. The dollar-
denominated RTS Index fell 4 percent to 1,950.15.  Markets across the world sank after S&P lowered its outlook
for the world’s biggest economy. Crude, Russia’s main export
earner, dropped as much as $2.92 per barrel after  Saudi Arabia ,
the world’s biggest exporter of the commodity, said the global
market has adequate crude supplies. Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi
said yesterday the “market is oversupplied.”  “Without a rebound in commodities, we do not see a strong
reason for Russian equities to resume their outperformance,”
Peter Szopo, head of research at  Alfa Bank , wrote in an e-mailed
report today.  OAO  Tatneft (TATN)  fell for a sixth day, losing 2.8 percent to
173.87 rubles, while OAO Rosneft retreated 3.5 percent to 238.75
rubles and OAO Lukoil slumped 3.1 percent to 1,901.6 rubles.  OAO Polymetal dropped 3.6 percent to 577.7 rubles, the
biggest decline since Dec. 10. The gold and silver producer may
miss its gold output target by as much as 10 percent this year,
Kommersant reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with
the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
