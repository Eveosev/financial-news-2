U.K. Financial Services Authority’s
Insurance Division Director Julian Adams said the regulator
would focus on assessing new capital models of the largest
insurers ahead of a January 2013 deadline, while smaller
companies may have to seek independent assurance that their
models are fit, Financial Times reported, citing Adams speaking
at an industry conference today.  Adams cited the “level of resources” available for the
difference in treatment, the newspaper said. Under the European
Union’s new Solvency II rules, insurers have the option of using
a “standard model” to calculate the amount of the capital they
hold, or using a more complicated “internal model” tailored to
a company’s particular risks, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
