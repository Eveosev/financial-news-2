Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average
declined for a second day after  China  raised  reserve
requirements  for banks, fueling concern more tightening measures
will curb demand in Japan’s biggest overseas market.  TDK Corp. (6762) , a manufacturer of electronic parts which gets
almost a third of its revenue from China, lost 3.7 percent.
 Komatsu Ltd. (6301)  a maker of construction equipment that has
benefited from China’s building boom, fell 1.2 percent.  Canon
Inc. (7751)  sank 1.4 percent after the yen gained, clouding the
earnings outlook for the camera maker, which gets about 80
percent of its sales overseas.  “There’s too much uncertainty for investors to be
confident enough to take positions,” said Koichi Kurose, chief
strategist in  Tokyo  at Resona Bank Ltd., which oversees about
$57 billion in assets. In China, “the tightening measures are
dragging on, and this isn’t good for stocks or the economy.”  The Nikkei fell 0.4 percent to 9,556.65 at the close of
trading in Tokyo, after earlier gaining as much as 0.2 percent.
The broader Topix dropped 0.6 percent to 836.34. The index has
declined 8.7 percent since a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami
on March 11 devastated  Japan ’s northeast coast and crippled
Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant.  China Tightens  TDK sank 3.7 percent to 4,305 yen. Komatsu, the world’s
second-biggest maker of construction equipment, fell 1.2 percent
to 2,752 yen following measures by China’s central bank on April
15 to cool investment and tame inflation.  China increased banks’ reserve requirements to lock up cash
and cool price gains after the world’s second-largest economy
showed signs of overheating. Inflation accelerated to 5.4
percent in March, the most since July 2008, the statistics
bureau said April 15.  Exporters dropped after the yen strengthened, dimming the
earnings outlook for companies when they repatriate overseas
sales. Canon lost 1.4 percent to 3,620 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s
No. 1 exporter of electronics, fell 1.4 percent to 2,427 yen.  The yen rose to as high as 118.94 against the euro today in
Tokyo, compared with 120.42 at the close of trading on April 15,
on speculation Greece may default on its debt. Against the
dollar, Japan’s currency also appreciated to 82.86 from 83.23.  Makers of food and drinks gained after Tokyo Electric Power
Co. set out a plan to end the nuclear crisis at its damaged
power plant within the next six to nine months. Radiation leaks
have contaminated some food and water supplies and caused the
evacuation of more than a hundred thousand people living within
20 kilometers (12 miles) of the plant.  Kikkoman Corp. (2801) , Japan’s biggest maker of soy sauce, rallied
2.5 percent to 786 yen.  Asahi Breweries Ltd. (2502) , a maker of beer
and other drinks, advanced 1.7 percent to 1,420 yen.  “People are getting less nervous about the level of
radiation contamination,”  Yuuki Sakurai , president at Fukoku
Capital Management Inc., which manages the equivalent of $8.6
billion in Tokyo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
