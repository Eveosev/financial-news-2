GLG Partners, owned by  Man Group
Plc (EMG) , is planning to shut its market neutral fund to new
investors when the size of the fund exceeds $1 billion, as it
seeks to ensure “performance and organic asset growth” are its
first priority, the Financial Times reported, citing Steve Roth,
the fund’s manager.  The fund is likely to close in the next few weeks, the FT
said, citing Roth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
