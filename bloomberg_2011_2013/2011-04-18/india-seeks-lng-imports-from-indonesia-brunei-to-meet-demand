India is seeking to buy liquefied
natural gas from Indonesia and Brunei to meet demand for the
cleaner-burning fuel in Asia’s second-biggest energy consumer.  The nation wants to import 5 million metric tons a year of
LNG from Indonesia, the oil ministry said in an e-mailed
statement. State-run  GAIL India Ltd. (GAIL)  is willing to consider
investing in Brunei’s oil and gas exploration and production to
help secure LNG supplies from the nation on the island of
Borneo, according to the statement.  Indian companies are searching for energy assets overseas
as production falls from ageing domestic fields.  Petronet LNG
Ltd. (PLNG) , the nation’s biggest importer of the fuel, is building a
terminal in Kerala state and Indian Oil Corp., the biggest
refiner, proposes to set up a plant at Ennore in south India.  Petronet LNG operates a 10 million ton-a-year LNG
regassification plant at Dahej in the western state of Gujarat
and expects to start the terminal at Kochi in the third quarter
of 2012.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  operates a 3.5 million ton-a-year
plant at Hazira in Gujarat.  Petronet currently imports 7.5 million tons of LNG a year
from Qatar under a long-term contract.  India wants to buy more crude oil from Kuwait as three new
refineries may start by March 2012, the oil ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
