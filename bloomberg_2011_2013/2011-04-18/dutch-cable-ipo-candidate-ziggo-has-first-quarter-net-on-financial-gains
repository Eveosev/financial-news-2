Ziggo BV, the Dutch cable-
television company whose owners may seek to raise as much as 1.5
billion euros ($2.2 billion) in an initial public offering,
reported a first-quarter profit helped by a gain from financial
instruments.  Ziggo had net income of 37.5 million euros, compared with a
3.9 million-euro loss a year earlier, the company said today in
a statement. Ziggo reported a 37-million euro gain in the fair
value of swap instruments used to manage its exposure to changes
in  interest rates  and financing costs. Sales rose 6.5 percent to
360.9 million euros.  “We expect sustained growth of our revenues,” Ziggo said
in the statement. “Given the momentum we currently have in the
market, we will step up our marketing and sales efforts and we
will show a modest increase in operating costs driven by the
growth of our customer base.”  Ziggo, controlled by private-equity firms Cinven Ltd. and
Warburg Pincus LLC, may sell as much as 50 percent of the
company in a share sale, two people with knowledge of the matter
said earlier this month. The Utrecht, Netherlands-based company
has an equity value of about 3 billion euros, the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
