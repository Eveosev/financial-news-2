Ethanol futures rebounded from a
two-week low on concern that bad weather will hurt corn crops
and boost production costs.  The alternative fuel gained the most since April 8 as corn
rose amid cold, wet Midwestern weather that could delay planting
and reduce crop yields. Ethanol in the U.S. is distilled from
the grain.  “We’re trading ethanol off of corn,” said  Rich Nelson ,
director of research at Allendale Inc. in McHenry,  Illinois .
“Weather is certainly a big problem.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery increased 1.3 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $2.631 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have risen 11 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago was unchanged at
$2.60 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the additive lost 5 cents,
or 1.8 percent, to $2.735, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast dropped 4.5 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $2.725 a gallon and in  New York  the fuel slipped 0.5
cent to $2.69.  Corn futures for July delivery rose 10 cents, or 1.3
percent, to close at $7.595 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel
distills into at least 2.75 gallons of the fuel.  Average ethanol mills in  Iowa  are losing 2 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in Illinois breaking even on a
spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive, Iowa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
