Corn rose from a two-week low and
soybeans gained on speculation that wet, cold weather in the
U.S. Midwest during the next two weeks will keep fields muddy,
delaying planting and reducing crop yields.  Most of the Midwest got 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) of rain in
the past three days with parts of the South getting 7.5 inches,
according to  Commodity Weather Group LLC.  As much as 3.5 inches
of moisture and below-normal temperatures by April 23 will slow
planting from  North Dakota  to  Mississippi , the forecaster said
today in a report. Corn prices have doubled in the past year,
while soybeans gained 36 percent.  “Severe weather problems are developing, which could delay
U.S. plantings and increase risks for lower yields,” said  Tim Hannagan , a market analyst for PFG Best Inc. in  Chicago .
“Temperatures are becoming a concern because farmers don’t like
to plant when soils are too cold for seed germination.”  Corn futures for July delivery rose 10 cents, or 1.3
percent, to close at $7.595 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Earlier, the price touched $7.41, the lowest for
the most-active contract since April 4. On April 11, the
commodity reached $7.8875, the highest since June 2008.  Soybean futures for July delivery climbed 12.5 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $13.5575 a bushel, the biggest gain since April
8. Last week, the prices dropped 4.3 percent, the most since
mid-March, on speculation that rising production in  South
America  will damp demand for U.S. supplies.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show. The U.S. is the world’s leading grower and exporter of
both commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
