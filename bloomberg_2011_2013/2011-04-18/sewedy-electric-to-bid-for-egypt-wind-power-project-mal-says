El Sewedy Electric Co. will bid to
build a 1000-megawatt wind power plant in  Egypt  when the
government opens bidding for the project, said Ahmed El Homosani, investor relations manager.  “We will be looking to participate when there’s a clear
bidding opportunity,” El Homosani said by telephone.  The project is due to be offered by the government in May,
 Al Mal  newspaper reported today. The government will buy the
electricity generated from the company chosen to implement the
project, allowing it to build, own and operate the plant for 20
years to 25 years, the Cairo-based business newspaper said.  El Sewedy shares lost 1.5 percent to 39.45 Egyptian pounds
at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, valuing the company at 6.77
billion pounds ($1.14 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
