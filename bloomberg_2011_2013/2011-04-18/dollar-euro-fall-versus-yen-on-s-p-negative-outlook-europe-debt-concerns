The dollar and the euro fell
against the yen on concerns about sovereign debt burdens in the
U.S. and  Europe .  The dollar slid to 82.42 yen as of 6:55 a.m. in Tokyo, from
82.66 in New York yesterday, when  Standard & Poor’s  said the
U.S. government risks losing its AAA credit rating unless policy
makers agree on a plan by 2013 to trim budget deficits.  The euro dropped to 117.26 yen from 117.66 yen after
Portuguese and Greek bond yields climbed to records on concern
about possible those governments’ capacity to meet their debts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
