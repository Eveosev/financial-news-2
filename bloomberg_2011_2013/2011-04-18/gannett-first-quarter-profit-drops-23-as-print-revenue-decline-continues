Gannett Co., the owner of 82
newspapers as well as television stations, reported first-
quarter profit decreased 23 percent as circulation and print-
advertising continued to decline.  Net income fell to $90.5 million, or 37 cents a share, from
$117.2 million, or 49 cents, a year earlier, the McLean,
Virginia-based company said today in a statement. Excluding some
items, earnings fell to 41 cents a share, matching the average
of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Gannett, whose newspapers include  USA Today , is the first
large newspaper owner to report its results for the quarter,
making it an indicator of how the industry is faring. Publishing
revenue, including advertising and circulation, declined 6.2
percent to $929.8 million. Digital revenue rose 12 percent.  Total revenue fell 3.7 percent to $1.25 billion, matching
the average analysts’ estimate.  Gannett added 59 cents to $15.39 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained
2 percent this year.  (Gannett is holding a conference call today at 10 a.m. New
