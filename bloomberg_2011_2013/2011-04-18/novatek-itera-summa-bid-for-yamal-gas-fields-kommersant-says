OAO Novatek, OAO Itera and Summa
Capital may bid for four licenses to gas fields in the Yamal
region that hold 2.3 trillion cubic meters of the fuel,
Kommersant reported, citing unidentified people familiar with
the matter.  The fields will supply a liquefied natural gas plant that
is being built in the Arctic region, the Moscow-based newspaper
reported today. Novatek, partly owned by OAO Gazprom, is
building the LNG plant with Total SA.     To contact the reporter on this story:
