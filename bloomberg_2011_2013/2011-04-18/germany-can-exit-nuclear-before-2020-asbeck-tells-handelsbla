Germany  can exit nuclear power
before 2020 by expanding renewable-energy generation and
transmission, Frank Asbeck, chief executive officer of
 Solarworld AG (SWV) , wrote in a Handelsblatt guest commentary today.  Renewable energy could account for more than 40 percent of
the country’s power consumption by 2020, up from 17 percent last
year, the CEO of the Bonn-based solar panel maker wrote in the
newspaper.  Some 1,100 kilometers (680 miles) of additional electricity
lines would suffice to integrate the volume, less than estimated
by the German Energy Agency, Asbeck said, citing the  Economy
Ministry .  Nuclear power accounted for 23 percent of Germany’s power
use last year, according to the BDEW utility association.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
