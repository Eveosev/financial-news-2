President  Barack Obama  and his
wife, Michelle, reported $1.7 million in adjusted gross income
last year and paid $453,770 in federal income taxes, according
to tax returns released yesterday by the White House.  The Obamas’ adjusted gross income for 2010 dropped about 69
percent from the previous year, when it was $5.5 million, and
2010 was the couple’s lowest-earning year since 2006, before
Obama’s presidential campaign generated interest in books he
wrote. Their total federal income tax liability for 2010 dropped
about 75 percent from 2009, when it was $1.8 million.  During a town hall-style meeting today, President Obama
described looking at his tax form, which he signed April 17.  “There is a moment there where you look at the figure
you’re paying and you say, ‘Wow, I don’t -- let me think about
my position on taxing the wealthy here,’” he said in Annandale,
Virginia. “Nobody volunteers and says, ‘Boy, I’m just wild to
pay more taxes.’ But it’s a matter of values and what we
prioritize. And I certainly don’t think my taxes should be even
lower.”  A debt-reduction plan Obama released last week calls for
letting taxes rise on the wealthiest Americans when lower tax
rates enacted under former President  George W. Bush  expire at
the end of 2012. “We are going to have to ask everybody to
sacrifice,” Obama said today. “We can’t just tell the
wealthiest among us, you don’t have to do a thing.”  Book Proceeds  A  White House blog post  from press secretary  Jay Carney 
said “the vast majority of the family’s income is the proceeds
from the sale of the president’s books.” In November 2010,
Obama released “Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters,” a
children’s book. He is also the author of a memoir, “Dreams
from My Father,” and “The Audacity of Hope,” which outlines
his political philosophy.  The Obamas reported $1.3 million in taxable income after
deductions. Obama earned his $400,000 presidential salary plus
almost $1.4 million in income associated with his books.  The Obamas paid the top marginal tax rate of 35 percent on
most of their income, and they would pay more if Congress passes
the president’s tax policies. Obama supports allowing the top
rate to return to 39.6 percent in 2013, when lower rates enacted
in 2001 and 2003 are set to expire. Last week, he announced his
support for curbing deductions by high earners among ways to
raise an additional $1 trillion of  tax revenue  over the next 12
years.  Charitable Contributions  In 2010, Obamas donated $245,075 to charities, or 14.2
percent of their adjusted gross income. That’s less than the
$329,100 they gave in 2009, when charitable contributions made
up 6 percent of their income. In 2009, the Obamas also donated
the entire $1.4 million that the president received for winning
the Nobel Peace Prize, which wasn’t counted as taxable income
because it was transferred directly to charities.  The largest single donation of $131,075 in 2010 went to
 Fisher House Foundation  Inc., which provides lodging for
military families near large military hospitals and hospitals
run by the Department of  Veterans Affairs . The president is
donating proceeds from Obama’s children’s book to a Fisher House
 scholarship fund  for children of military personnel who were
killed or became disabled through active military service.  The next-largest contribution, $15,000, went to the  Clinton
Bush Haiti Fund . Other recipients of the Obamas’ donations
included the  Boys & Girls Clubs of America , which got $10,000;
the  United Negro College Fund , which got $5,000; and the
 University of Hawaii Foundation , which got $2,000.  Itemized Deductions  In addition to the charitable contributions, the Obamas
claimed itemized deductions of $78,269 for state and local taxes
and $49,945 for home mortgage interest. They owed the state of
 Illinois  $51,568.  The Obamas made estimated tax payments during the year and
will receive a federal tax refund of $12,334 and a state tax
refund of $959.  Obama is using many common tax-planning techniques,
including retirement accounts and timing of state tax payments,
to minimize alternative minimum tax liability, said Alan Dlugash, a tax partner at the accounting firm Marks, Paneth &
Shron LLP in  New York .  Dlugash said that given current low  interest rates , he
would advise clients with the Obamas’ apparent cash resources to
pay off their mortgages as a way of getting a higher rate of
return.  “I’ve advised most of my clients to pay it down, but he’s
still keeping his own mortgage and seems to be paying it down in
the normal way,” Dlugash said.  Biden Taxes  Vice President  Joe Biden  and his wife, Jill, reported
adjusted gross income of $379,178 and paid $86,626 of federal
income taxes. They owed $7,180 of that amount with the return.
The Bidens paid $7,669 under the alternative minimum tax, the
parallel tax system that was originally designed to prevent
high-income taxpayers from using legal deductions to avoid all
income taxes.  The Bidens contributed $5,350 to charity. Their largest
cash contribution of $1,400 went to the Northern Virginia
Community College Alumni Scholarship Fund.  Jill Biden  teaches at
the school, which paid her $82,488 last year, according to the
 tax return .  To contact the reporter on this story:
