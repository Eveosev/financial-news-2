Cash premiums for corn shipped in
April to terminals near  New Orleans  declined relative to Chicago
futures as demand ebbed for U.S. grain. The soybean basis was
unchanged.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered in the
second half of this month was 56 cents to 58 cents a bushel
above May futures, compared with 58 cents to 59 cents on April
15, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show. The basis for
soybeans delivered in April was 58 cents to 64 cents a bushel.  “Demand is slowing because U.S. corn is not competitive
with cheaper wheat supplies from overseas exporters,” said  Dale Durchholz , the senior analyst at AgriVisor LLC in Bloomington,
 Illinois . “U.S. exporter buying also slowed after the futures
rally today.”  Corn futures for May delivery rose 9.75 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $7.5175 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Last
week, the contract dropped 3.4 percent, snapping a four-week
rally.  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 12.5 cents to
$13.4425 a bushel.  In the week ended April 14, corn inspected for export at
U.S. ports tumbled 21 percent to 32.161 million bushels from a
week earlier, the USDA said today. The amount fell to a seven-
week low and was down 21 percent from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
