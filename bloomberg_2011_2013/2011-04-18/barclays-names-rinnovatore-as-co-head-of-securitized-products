Barclays Capital  named Diane Rinnovatore co-head of securitized products origination as the
bank rebuilds its department following departures.  Rinnovatore will run the group with Cory Wishengrad,
according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News.
Rinnovatore has been in the debt capital markets group at
Barclays since 2008 and previously was co-head of securitized
products banking at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., according to
the memo, the contents of which were confirmed by Brandon Ashcraft, a Barclays Capital spokesman.  Barclays hired Martin Attea from Morgan Stanley last month.
The lender is rebuilding its securitization group after Jay Kim,
a co-head of the department, left with at least 10 bankers for
Credit Suisse Group AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
