U.S. nuclear-power output fell to
the lowest level in almost 4 ½ years after a tornado forced
Surry Units 1 and 2 in  Virginia  to shut yesterday, the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission said.  Power generation nationwide fell 3,730 megawatts, or 4.9
percent, from April 15 to 72,425 megawatts, or 71 percent of
capacity, the smallest amount since Oct. 22, 2006, according to
an NRC report today and data compiled by Bloomberg. Twenty-nine
of the nation’s 104 reactors were offline.  The Surry reactors, operated by Dominion Resources Inc.
with a capacity of 799 megawatts each, automatically shut down
when a tornado touched down in the switchyard and knocked out
offsite power, the NRC said. The incident was declared an
“unusual event,” the lowest of four categories in the federal
agency’s emergency classification system. Unit 1 was operating
at full power and Unit 2 at 98 percent of capacity on April 15.  “No release of radioactive material has occurred beyond
those minor releases associated with normal station
operations,” Dominion said in a statement yesterday. “The
apparent tornado did not strike the two nuclear units, which are
designed to withstand natural events such as tornados,
hurricanes and earthquakes.”  No Injuries  There were no injuries at the plant, 17 miles (27
kilometers) northwest of Newport News, and the company said it
is working to restore electrical service to the station.  Dominion notified authorities that about 100 gallons of oil
leaked from an above-ground storage tank and 200 gallons of oil
spilled from a damaged transformer, the NRC said.  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  idled the 685-megawatt Pilgrim 1 reactor in
 Massachusetts  after it was operating at 86 percent of capacity
on April 15. The plant is 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) east of
Plymouth.
      Scana Corp. (SCG)  closed the 966-megawatt Virgil C. Summer
reactor, which was operating at 40 percent of capacity on April
15. The plant is near Jenkinsville,  South Carolina , about 26
miles northwest of Columbia.  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  shut the 1,152-megawatt Braidwood 2 reactor in
 Illinois , operating at 91 percent of capacity on April 15.
Another reactor on the site, the 1,178-megawatt Braidwood 1
unit, was operating at full power. The plant is about 54 miles
southwest of  Chicago .  Ohio Reactor Idled  FirstEnergy Corp. (FE)  idled the 1,235-megawatt Perry nuclear
reactor in Ohio for refueling. The plant, located on Lake Erie
about 35 miles northeast of Cleveland, was operating at 86
percent of capacity on April 15.  FirstEnergy started the 940-megawatt Beaver Valley 1
reactor in Shippingport, Pennsylvania, about 26 miles northwest
of Pittsburgh. It was operating at 82 percent of capacity today.
Another 940-megawatt unit at the plant, Beaver Valley 2, is
operating at full power.  The Tennessee Valley Authority boosted output from the
1,104-megawatt Browns Ferry 2 reactor in  Alabama  to full power
from 92 percent of capacity on April 15.  Browns Ferry Units 1 and 3, which have respective
capacities of 1,065 megawatts and 1,115 megawatts, are operating
at full power. The plant is 84 miles north of Birmingham near
the Tennessee line.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
