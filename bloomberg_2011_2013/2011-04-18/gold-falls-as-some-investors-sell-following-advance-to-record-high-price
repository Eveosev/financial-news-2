Gold fell in  New York  as some
investors sold the metal after prices rallied to a record on
concern about European debt and faster inflation. Silver touched
a 31-year high.  Bullion futures reached a record $1,489.70 an ounce today.
China increased banks’ reserve requirements to cool inflation
that quickened in March to the fastest pace since 2008. The euro
weakened against the dollar on speculation Greece will be unable
to avoid a default. Unrest in the Middle East and North Africa
and concerns about Japan’s nuclear crisis also helped gold’s
gain this year.  “A further pullback could be seen in gold and silver given
the gains seen in recent weeks,” James Moore, an analyst at
TheBullionDesk.com in London, said in a report to clients.
Still, “rising debt problems could dampen economic recovery in
the  euro zone , and when coupled with other factors such as
inflation, Middle East and North African unrest and the impact
of Japan’s earthquake, we expect dip-buying to underpin the
metals.”  Gold futures for June delivery fell $5.80, or 0.4 percent,
to $1,480.20 an ounce by 8 a.m. on the Comex in New York. The
metal for immediate delivery in London was 0.5 percent lower at
$1,479.65 an ounce after reaching a record $1,488.68.  The cost of insuring Greek government debt rose to a record
today. Greece isn’t discussing restructuring its debt, Finance
Minister  George Papaconstantinou  said April 16 in  Washington .
Greece received a bailout from the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund  last year, and has been followed by
Ireland and  Portugal  in seeking aid.  Faster Inflation  Reserve ratios will rise a half point from April 21, the
People’s Bank of China said on its website yesterday. The
 European Central Bank  this month raised  interest rates  from a
record low as inflation in the region quickened to 2.7 percent
in March, the fastest pace since October 2008.  Libyan rebels repelled an attack from forces loyal to
Muammar Qaddafi on the city of Ajdabiya, defending the front
line that runs between the country’s two biggest cities. Rebels
have struggled for weeks to take and hold cities in central
Libya. Yemen’s opposition coalition rejected a plan by six Gulf
states to end unrest in the Arabian country, saying that the
swift departure of Yemen’s President Ali Abdullah Saleh isn’t
negotiable.  Silver for May delivery in New York climbed as much as 1.9
percent to $43.38 an ounce, the highest price since January
1980, the year futures reached a record $50.35. The metal was
