The  International Monetary Fund 
today said that Brazil, China and Turkey are “notable
examples” of emerging-market nations where conditions suggest a
banking crisis could arise.  “Signs of nascent credit booms in some emerging G-20
economies -- if not addressed by appropriate policy responses --
may portend risks of eventual financial crises and hard landings
for economic growth,” the IMF said in a report today, published
after its spring meetings.  In Brazil, external financing conditions and credit growth
are contributing to overheating, while Turkey faces “booming
credit” and evidence of vulnerabilities. The IMF said China
should raise  interest rates  and lessen its reliance on
quantitative limits and reserve requirements when tightening
policies.  The IMF also renewed its call for currencies in emerging
economies to appreciate relative to advanced economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
