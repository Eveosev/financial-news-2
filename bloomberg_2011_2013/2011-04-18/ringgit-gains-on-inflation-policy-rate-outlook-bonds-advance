Malaysia’s ringgit gained for a
second day on speculation policy makers will raise  interest
rates  or tolerate a stronger currency to tackle inflation.  The currency traded near the strongest level in 13 years as
economists predicted consumer prices probably rose 3.1 percent
in March, the most since April 2009, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey. The government
will report the data on April 20. Inflation accelerated more
than economists expected in India and  China  in March as  oil
prices  jumped 19 percent this year.  Government bonds  advanced.  “The inflation issue is still very much alive,” said D. Sivadass, a currency-forwards trader at EON Capital Bhd. in
Kuala Lumpur. “The authorities have got a few options via rates,
the ringgit or other forms of tightening. We still see a lot of
foreign interest betting on a stronger ringgit.”  The ringgit gained 0.1 percent to 3.0216 per dollar as of
4:37 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It reached 3.0165 on April 11, matching the strongest
level since October 1997, and may advance to 3.0180 this week,
Sivadass said.  Bank Negara Malaysia  has kept its overnight policy rate at
2.75 percent since July, after raising it three times earlier in
2010. The central bank asked lenders to set aside more reserves
from this month and meets next to review interest rates on May 5.  China said yesterday it will raise banks’ reserve-
requirement ratios from April 21. Central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said monetary tightening will continue for “some
time.”  Malaysia’s three-year bonds gained. The government is
scheduled to sell Shariah-compliant bonds maturing in April 2021
later this month, according to its sale calendar.  The yield on the 3.434 percent note maturing in August 2014
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.34 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia. That’s the lowest since the notes
were sold on Feb. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
