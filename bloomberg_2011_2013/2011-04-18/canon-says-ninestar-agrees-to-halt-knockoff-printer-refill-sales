Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s largest
maker of cameras and office equipment, said China’s  Ninestar
Image International Ltd.  and retailers agreed to stop importing
and selling copycat printer toner cartridges.  Canon filed complaints last year at the U.S. International
Trade Commission against 20 companies in China, Hong Kong and
the U.S., claiming infringement of patents related to the
rotating drums inside toner cartridges. The products can be used
in Canon and  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  laser printers. An ITC judge
approved a consent order that will terminate the case, Tokyo-
based Canon said in a statement today.  The case is being withdrawn after the companies pledged not
to sell the products without Canon’s consent or license, which
the company said it “has no present intention to grant.” Canon
said it filed the complaint to halt sales, “which is precisely
what the consent order will do.”  The ITC case is In the Matter of Toner Cartridges and
Components Thereof, 337-731, U.S. International Trade Commission
( Washington ). The civil suit is Canon Inc. v. Ninestar Image
International Ltd., 10cv4999, U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
