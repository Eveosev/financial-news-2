U.K. government ministers are
considering granting ‘draconian’ powers to the  Civil Aviation
Authority  to be used if snow hits major airports, the Daily
Telegraph reported, without saying where it obtained the
information.  The CAA would be allowed to step in and instruct airports
on clearing snow from aircraft stands and runways and coping
with bad weather, following last winter’s chaos when hundreds of
flights were canceled and thousands of passengers stranded, the
newspaper said.  The authority would be allowed to step in immediately
instead of just issuing fines after the event, the Telegraph
said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
