Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA may
challenge  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA (USIM5) ’s change in the
way minority shareholders will be paid for stake sales or
purchases, Valor Economico said, citing unidentified sources.  Under new rules, minority holders will be paid based on
book value rather than an estimate by auditors, the Sao Paulo-
based newspaper said. The change in by-laws for the so-called
right of withdrawal may make it easier for rival Gerdau SA to
join Usiminas’ controlling group, Valor said.  Rio de Janeiro-based CSN, which holds 8.6 percent of
Usiminas’s common shares and voted against the change in an
April 14 shareholders meeting, may ask Brazil’s market regulator
to review the new rules, Valor said.  A CSN official in Sao Paulo and a Usiminas official in  Belo
Horizonte  didn’t immediately return calls seeking comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
