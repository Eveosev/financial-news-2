The following is the text of
 Canada 's employment insurance report for Feb. released
by Statistics Canada.  In February, 628,900 people received regular Employment
Insurance (EI) benefits, down 8,300 (-1.3%) from January
and a fifth consecutive monthly decrease. The number of
beneficiaries declined in all provinces except Prince
Edward Island.  Lower number of claims  To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a
claim. The number of claims provides an indication of the
number of people who could become beneficiaries.  The number of initial and renewal claims totalled
239,000 in February, down 2,700 or 1.1% from January. This
was the third decline in four months.  There were fewer claims in Manitoba,  New Brunswick ,
Alberta, British Columbia and  Quebec  in February, while
the number increased in Saskatchewan and Ontario.  Fewer beneficiaries in most provinces  In February, the number of regular beneficiaries
declined in every province except Prince Edward Island.
Over the past five months, the number of beneficiaries has
been trending down in all provinces.  The fastest rate of monthly decline in beneficiaries
occurred in Saskatchewan, where it fell 5.1% (-600) to
11,200 from January. At the same time, the number
decreased in Alberta by 2.9% (-1,300) to 43,100
recipients. In Manitoba, it declined by 2.7% (-390) to
14,300.  In Quebec, 180,300 people received benefits in
February, down 1.5% (-2,800) from January, while in
Ontario, the number of beneficiaries edged down 0.6% 
(-1,100) to 191,500.  The number of people receiving regular benefits in
February remained virtually unchanged in Prince  Edward
Island  at 8,500 (+0.1%).  Sub-provincial and demographic overview  Employment Insurance data by sub-provincial region, sex
and age are not seasonally adjusted and are therefore
compared on a year-over-year basis.  Continued year-over-year declines in most large centres  Between February 2010 and February 2011, the number of
regular beneficiaries fell by 98,600 (-11.3%) at the
national level, with decreases in 129 of the 143 large
centres (see map). Large centres are those with a
population of 10,000 or more.  In Newfoundland and Labrador, the number of
beneficiaries declined in all five large centres. The
fastest rate of decrease occurred in St. John's, which
fell by 12.4% (-800) to 5,600, the 11th consecutive month
of year-over-year declines.  The number of regular beneficiaries fell in 31 of 33
large centres in Quebec between February 2010 and February
2011. The fastest declines occurred in Saint-Georges,
Sorel-Tracy, Granby, La Tuque and Rouyn-Noranda. There
were 12.3% fewer beneficiaries (-10,700) in  Montreal , the
12th consecutive month of year-over-year declines. In the
census metropolitan area (CMA) of Quebec, the number of
beneficiaries declined by 5.6% (-870) compared with
February 2010.  In Ontario, the number of regular beneficiaries has
fallen in 38 of its 41 large centres since February 2010.
The largest percentage declines occurred in Greater
Sudbury, Tillsonburg, Belleville, Guelph and Thunder Bay.
In Greater Sudbury, 44.4% fewer people (-2,600) received
regular benefits, the eighth consecutive monthly year-over-
year decline. In Toronto, 81,100 people received benefits
in February, down 18.3% (-18,100) from the same month a
year earlier.  In Manitoba, the fastest decline over the past 12
months occurred in Winnipeg, down 17.0% to 8,200 in
February.  The number of beneficiaries decreased in all eight
large centres in Saskatchewan. The most notable rates of
decline occurred in Yorkton and Moose Jaw. In Regina, the
number of beneficiaries decreased by 19.9% (-420) to
1,700, while in Saskatoon, 18.1% (-550) fewer people
received benefits.  In  Alberta , 11 of the 12 large centres had fewer
beneficiaries in February compared with February 2010. The
pace of decline in the number of beneficiaries was fastest
in Brooks, Camrose, Red Deer, Grande Prairie and Calgary.
In Calgary, the number of beneficiaries fell by 30.2% 
(-6,100) to 14,000, while in  Edmonton , it declined by 16.2%
(-2,900) to 14,900. February marked the 11th consecutive
monthly year-over-year decline for both CMAs.  In British Columbia, most large centres had fewer
beneficiaries in February than the same month a year
earlier. The rate of decline was most pronounced in Fort
St. John, Quesnel and Prince George. In  Vancouver , 33,400
people received regular benefits in February, down 11.0% 
(-4,100), the ninth year-over-year monthly decline in a row.
The number of beneficiaries fell by 5.6% (-250) to 4,300
in Victoria, the 11th consecutive monthly year-over-year
decline.  Demographic groups  Faster year-over-year decline for men than women  Between February 2010 and February 2011, the number of
men receiving regular Employment Insurance benefits fell
by 12.7% or 74,600, continuing the downward trend of year-
over-year declines that began in March 2010.  The number of male beneficiaries declined by 14.8% 
(-59,000) among those aged 25 to 54, and by 14.5% (-11,000)
for men under 25 years old. The decline was much slower
among men aged 55 and over, at 4.1% (-4,600).  For women, the rate of decrease in the number of
beneficiaries was 8.5% (-23,900), the largest of nine
consecutive year-over-year percentage decreases.  The number of female beneficiaries fell by 15.1% 
(-3,500) among those under 25 years old, and by 10.2% 
(-21,000) among women aged 25 to 54. In contrast, the number
of female beneficiaries aged 55 and over edged up by 1.0%
(+540).  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted unless
otherwise specified.  Each month,  Statistics Canada  provides analysis of the
current labour market situation, using Employment
Insurance (EI) statistics and other sources. Earlier this
month, the Labour Force Survey (LFS) provided a picture of
overall labour market conditions, including unemployment,
total employment and those affected by changes in the
labour market.  In this release, Statistics Canada provides additional
sub-provincial detail through the EI statistics. Details
by industry will follow with data from the Survey of
Employment, Payrolls and Hours.  EI statistics are produced from an administrative data
source from Human Resources and Skills Development Canada.
These statistics may, from time to time, be affected by
changes to the Employment Insurance Act or administrative
procedures. The number of regular beneficiaries and the
number of claims received for January and February 2011
are preliminary. In this release, large centres correspond
to those with a population of 10,000 or more.  The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all persons
who received EI benefits from February 13 to 19. This
period coincides with the reference week of the LFS.  EI statistics indicate the number of people who
received EI benefits, and should not be confused with data
coming from the LFS, which provides information on the
total number of unemployed people.  There are always a certain proportion of unemployed
people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed
people have not contributed to the program because they
have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment
is not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed
to the program but do not meet the eligibility criteria,
such as workers who left their job voluntarily or those
who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive
benefits.  The change in the number of regular EI beneficiaries
reflects various situations, including people becoming
beneficiaries, people going back to work, and people
exhausting their regular benefits.
