United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA) , a
Nigerian lender with operations in 18 countries, rose to the
highest in more than a week after saying it plans to open two
more units in  Africa .  The stock gained 12 kobo, or 1.5 percent, to 8.17 naira,
its highest value since April 7, by the 2:30 p.m. close in
Lagos.  UBA plans to start operating in Mali and Republic of Congo,
Managing Director Phillips Oduoza said on Johannesburg-based
CNBC Africa television today.  Expanding into other African countries fits into UBA’s
plans of becoming a “leading African bank,” Oduoza said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
