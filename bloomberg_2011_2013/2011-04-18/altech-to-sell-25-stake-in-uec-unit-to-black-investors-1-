Allied Technologies Ltd. (ALT) , a South
African electronics and telecommunications holding company, said
it will sell a 25 percent plus-one-share stake in its Altech UEC
unit’s African operations to black investors.  Altech UEC’s main business is the production of digital
television decoders. Under the deal, its Africa-based assets
will be acquired by a new company that will in turn sell a
quarter of its shares to a group comprising Power Matla, Epiworx
Investment and Empower a Thousand Holdings, Altech, as the
Johannesburg-based parent company is known, said in a stock-
exchange statement today.  South African companies are being pushed by the government
to sell stakes in their businesses to black investors to make up
for discrimination during apartheid rule, which ended in 1994.  “The transaction is evidence of Altech’s commitment to
transformation and empowerment,” Altech Chief Executive Officer
Craig Venter said in the statement. “These diversified black
investment companies have an established history of adding value
to their underlying investments whilst promoting the social and
economic development of black people.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
