(Corrects currency in third paragraph of story originally
published on April 18.)  Bank Sarasin & Cie AG (BSAN) , the Swiss
wealth manager controlled by Rabobank Groep NV, plans new hires
in Dubai and  Singapore  to build its Sharia-compliant business.  “We’ve beaten our targets for assets under management and
profitability,” Fares Mourad, head of Islamic finance at the
Basel, Switzerland-based bank, said today in an interview. “The
business has developed very nicely.”  Sarasin invests about 10 percent of Middle East clients’
assets in Sharia-compliant products after starting an Islamic
finance unit in November 2009. The bank’s Asian and Middle East
assets under management were 16.1 billion Swiss francs ($17.9
billion) at the end of 2010.  Sarasin employs three people in Switzerland and one in
Dubai selling Sharia-compliant products to clients from Qatar,
Bahrain and the  United Arab Emirates . Political turmoil in North
Africa and the Middle East may generate more wealth for the
region as  oil prices  increase, the bank said in a  report 
published today.  “The big Gulf states stand to profit from the unrest in
North Africa,” Jan Amrit Poser, chief economist at Sarasin,
wrote in the bank’s second annual Islamic wealth management
report. “The continuing rise in oil prices will generate a
spectacular amount of additional revenue for the Gulf states.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
