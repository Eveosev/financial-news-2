What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that rising
global  interest rates  may damp demand, said Greg Grow, the
director of agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc. in
Chicago. Corn for delivery after the U.S. harvest may rise 3
cents to 5 cents as cold, wet weather in the Midwest delays
planting, Grow said.  -- Soybean futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago on speculation that rising production in  South America 
will erode demand for U.S. supplies, Grow said. Soybean-oil
futures are expected to open steady to 0.1 cent a pound lower,
and soybean-meal futures may open steady to down $1 for 2,000
pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as dry weather threatens crops in the U.S., China
and parts of Europe, Grow said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
