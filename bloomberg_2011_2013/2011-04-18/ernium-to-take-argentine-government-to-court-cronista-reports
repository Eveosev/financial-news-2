Siderar SAIC (ERAR) , a steelmaking unit of
 Ternium SA (TX) , will take the Argentine government to court after
the securities regulator declared the company’s annual
shareholders’ meeting invalid, El Cronista Comercial  reported .  Siderar may file an injunction today, the Buenos Aires-
based newspaper reported, citing company officials that it
didn’t identify. The regulator said the April 15 meeting was
invalid because two voting systems were used: one as if the
state pension agency owned a 5 percent stake and another as if
it owned 26 percent, El Cronista reported.  Siderar’s meeting is in recess and will continue May 11,
the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
