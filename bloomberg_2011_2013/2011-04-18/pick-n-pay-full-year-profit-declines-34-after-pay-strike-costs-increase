Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. (PIK) ,  South
Africa ’s second-biggest grocer, said fiscal full-year profit
dropped 34 percent after a pay strike cut sales in the fourth
quarter and costs climbed.  Net income fell to 784.9 million rand ($115 million) in the
year through Feb. 28, compared with 1.19 billion rand a year
earlier, the Cape Town-based company said in a statement today.
Sales rose 6 percent to 51.9 billion rand.  “The 2011 financial year was the toughest trading year in
our group’s history,” the company said in the statement.  Pick n Pay workers ended a 13-day strike on Nov. 11 after
the retailer agreed to a three-year deal to raise wages,
boosting costs as food and energy prices climb. The grocer is
also pushing ahead with plans to expand in  Africa , opening its
second store in  Zambia  last month, and raising 500 million rand
on March 18 to fund its growth plans.  Pick n Pay had estimated on March 31 that per-share
earnings fell between 25 percent and 40 percent in the past
fiscal year. The retailer is in the process of exiting its
Franklins  Australia  business and sold its Score Supermarkets in
South Africa, both of which are now reported as discontinued
operations.  The retailer plans to open three more stores in Zambia,
three in  Mozambique  and two in Mauritius in 2012, it said. It
will also continue with its plans to sell Franklins through a
“competitive tender process” if the Federal Court of Australia
blocks the sale of the unit to Metcash Ltd., Pick n Pay said.  Larger rival  Shoprite Holdings Ltd. (SHP)  said on Feb. 22 profit
climbed 12 percent to 1.2 billion rand in the six months through
December from a year ago.  Pick n Pay’s stock has declined 8.7 percent this year
through the April 15 close of 44.20 rand, giving the company a
market value of 21.2 billion rand  To contact the reporter on this story:
