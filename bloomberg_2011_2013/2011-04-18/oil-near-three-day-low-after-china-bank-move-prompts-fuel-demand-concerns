Oil fell for a second day as signs
of a worsening economic outlook in the U.S. stoked speculation
fuel demand may falter.  Crude has fallen more than $2 a barrel since  Standard &
Poor’s  cut the U.S. long-term credit outlook yesterday, dipping
below $120 in London today on concern the economic recovery may
falter. OPEC Secretary General Abdalla el-Badri said there is
“no shortage of oil anywhere in the world,” and  Iran ’s OPEC
Governor Mohammad Ali Khatibi said in Tehran the group is
unlikely to change production targets when it meets in June.  “The last couple of months we’ve focused on supply; now
the market is focusing again on demand,” said Thina Saltvedt,
an analyst at Nordea Bank AB in Oslo. “It looks like the price
is starting to hurt the economy. Prices of $120 and above are
going to weigh on the market.”  Brent crude oil for June settlement fell as much as $2.21,
or 1.8 percent, to $119.40 a barrel and traded at $119.48 at
1:44 p.m. on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London.
Yesterday, the contract slipped $1.84, or 1.5 percent, to
$121.61, the lowest since April 12.  Crude oil for May delivery on the New York Mercantile
Exchange slid $1.42, or 1.3 percent, to $105.70 a barrel.
Yesterday, it declined $2.54 to settle at $107.12, the lowest
since April 13. The contract expires today. The more-actively
traded June future fell $1.36 to $106.33.  U.S. Debt Rating  Standard & Poor’s put the U.S. government on notice that it
risks losing its AAA credit rating unless policy makers agree on
a plan to cut budget deficits and the national debt. Concern
that Europe’s debt crisis is worsening sent Greek and Portuguese
bond yields surging.  Oil declined yesterday after China increased banks’ reserve
requirements to cool inflation, signaling fuel demand growth may
slow, and Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said the
market is “oversupplied.” The kingdom is the biggest supplier
in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  An Energy Department report tomorrow may show U.S. crude
inventories increased 1.4 million barrels last week from 359.3
million, climbing for a seventh week, according to analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Oil traders have turned $80 crude into the second-biggest
bet in the options market as a surge in futures to the highest
level since 2008 spurred concern demand may tumble.  Open Interest Doubles  Open interest, the number of contracts held by traders,
more than doubled since January for $80 put options for December
2011 and 2012 as New York futures last week touched a 30-month
high of $113.46 a barrel. The two puts, bets that prices will
fall, account for 21 percent of the open interest among the top
10 contracts traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Options contracts that give investors the right to sell
December 2012 futures at $80 a barrel rose 21 cents to $4.76 a
barrel in electronic trading yesterday on the Nymex. December
2011 $80 puts gained 15 cents to $1.34.  Prices surged last week as fighting in  Libya  threatened to
prolong supply cuts from  Africa ’s third largest producer. The
 United Nations  has reached an agreement with Muammar Qaddafi’s
regime that permits aid workers and supplies into Misrata, the
Libyan city pounded by government forces in a push to reach the
port providing the rebels’ supply line for food and weapons.  The unrest is the bloodiest in a wave of uprisings that has
toppled leaders in Egypt and  Tunisia  and spread to Algeria,
 Bahrain , Iran, Oman, Syria and Yemen. Libya’s crude production,
which averaged 1.6 million barrels a day last year, shrank to
390,000 barrels a day in March, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of producers, analysts and companies.  “The continuing conflict in Libya and the prospect of that
spreading is still something to watch,” said  Ben Westmore , a
minerals and energy economist at National Australia Bank Ltd. in
 Melbourne .  In  Nigeria , the incumbent leader,  Goodluck Jonathan , won a
presidential election as violent protests against the result
killed at least six, underscoring the political risk in Africa’s
biggest oil producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
