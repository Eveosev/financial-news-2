Hecla Mining Co. (HL) , the largest U.S.
silver producer, halted work at the Lucky Friday mine in
Northern Idaho after a roof collapse left a worker missing.  Miner Larry Marek, 53 is unaccounted for after the April 15
accident in a tunnel about a mile underground, Hecla said today
in a statement. A 10-foot-high by 20-foot-wide section of the
mine’s roof fell where two miners were working, the company
said. The other employee is safe, Hecla said in a separate
statement on its  website . Hecla plans to begin using a remote-
controlled earth-mover today to dig toward the collapsed area.  “Our current focus is 100 percent directed to rescuing the
miner and ensuring the safety of the rescue team,” Chief
Executive Officer Phil Baker said in the statement.  Lucky Friday is the deepest operating mine in the U.S.,
according to Hecla. The 69-year-old silver, lead and zinc
operation is located about 90 miles east of Spokane,  Washington ,
and produced 3.5 million ounces of silver in 2009.  Shares of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho-based Hecla fell 75 cents,
or 7.8 percent, to $8.86 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, marking the biggest closing decline since
October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
