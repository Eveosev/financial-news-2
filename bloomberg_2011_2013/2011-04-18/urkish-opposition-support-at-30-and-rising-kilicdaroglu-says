Turkey ’s main opposition leader
 Kemal Kilicdaroglu  said his party’s support was at 29.5 percent
and rising ahead of elections against Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  on June 12,  Hurriyet  newspaper reported.  The opposition party’s polls show a trend of falling
support for Erdogan’s ruling Justice and Development Party that
Kilicdaroglu said he expected to accelerate in the approach to
the elections, Hurriyet columnist Fatih Cekirge reported today
after an interview with Kilicdaroglu on a bus in Istanbul.  Kilicdaroglu’s Republican People’s Party, or CHP, is
gaining support among women and young people with proposals
including expanded family insurance, support for the poor and
shorter mandatory military service, Kilicdaroglu said.  Kilicdaroglu has branded his movement the “new CHP,” and
approved a list of candidates for parliament that included only
37 of its currently serving 101 deputies, according to an April
12 report in Milliyet newspaper.  A poll published March 25 by research company Metropoll
Stratejik & Sosyal Arastirmalar showed Erdogan’s party had 48
percent support compared to CHP’s 28 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
