Zillow Inc., an online real-estate
information service, may raise as much as $51.8 million in an
initial public offering, capitalizing on growing demand for
shares in quickly growing Internet companies.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  is managing the offering, Seattle-based
Zillow said today in a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. Allen & Co., Needham & Co., ThinkEquity LLC
and First Washington Corp. are also underwriting the deal.
Zillow didn’t say how many shares it will sell or at what price.  Founded in 2006,  Zillow  lets home buyers, sellers, renters
and managers list and search for properties, home-price
estimates and other information. Sales climbed 74 percent last
year to $30.5 million from $17.5 million in 2009. Its loss
narrowed to $6.77 million, or 16 cents a share, from $12.9
million, or 30 cents, a year earlier.  Zillow’s biggest outside investors are  Technology Crossover
Ventures  and Benchmark Capital, which own 30 percent and 19
percent of the company’s Class A common stock, respectively. PAR
Investment Partners LP owns 11 percent. All of Zillow’s Class B
Stock and 88 percent of the voting power is controlled by co-
founders Richard Barton and Lloyd Frink. A financing round of
$30 million in 2007 valued Zillow at $400 million.  Zillow is the latest in a growing list of U.S. Internet
companies looking to go public. Online radio service Pandora
Media Inc. filed in February, following business-networking site
LinkedIn Corp. in January. Vacation-rental company HomeAway Inc.
filed for an IPO last month.  Glam Media Inc., a provider of Internet-advertising
services targeting women, is talking to bankers about an IPO
filing as early as this year, two people familiar with the
matter said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
