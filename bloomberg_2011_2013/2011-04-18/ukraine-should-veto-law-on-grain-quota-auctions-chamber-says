Ukrainian President  Viktor Yanukovych  should veto legislation for auctions of quotas to
export grains, the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine said.  The bill, which has parliamentary approval and needs the
president’s signature to take effect, “contravenes market
principles, current legislation” and Ukraine’s international
obligations, the Kiev-based  chamber  said in a letter to the
president dated April 14. The letter was e-mailed to Bloomberg
News by the business group today.  Some companies “received quotas for free, while others
would have to pay for them at auctions,” the chamber said in
the letter. Yanukovych’s office has yet to respond, policy
manager Yaroslav Voytko said today.  Ukraine imposed the quotas in October after Russia banned
all cereal exports following a drought that seared fields. The
curbs were needed to keep domestic prices from rising, Ukrainian
authorities have said. Yanukovych said April 6 an export duty
should replace the quotas, which are scheduled to run through
June.  The chamber in March called on the government to drop the
quotas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
