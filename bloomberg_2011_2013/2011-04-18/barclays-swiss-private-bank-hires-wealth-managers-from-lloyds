Barclays Plc’s  private bank  in
Geneva hired five bankers from a cross-town rival Lloyds TSB
Private Banking to build its Middle East client base.  The new staff including Mike Ferguson, who joins as a
managing director, brings hiring in Geneva to seven this year,
Patrick Ramsey, general manager of  Barclays Bank  (Suisse) SA,
said today in a phone interview. The other arrivals are Sylvie Orsatti, Sana Al-Habal, Philippe Sala and Fawziyah Khazal.  “They’re focused on the Middle East,” Ramsey said.
“We’re in discussions with a few others.”  The new hires will increase Barclays’s Geneva-based
relationship managers to more than 50, Ramsey said. The U.K.
bank’s wealth management arm, which oversaw 164 billion pounds
($267.4 billion) worldwide at the end of 2010, has hired more
than 100 bankers this year, according to Emmanuel Fievet, head
of international private banking.  Barclays’s Swiss wealth business had 16 billion francs
($17.9 billion) under management at the end of 2009.  Lloyds TSB Private Banking is a unit of Lloyds Banking
Group Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
