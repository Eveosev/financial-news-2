Fiat SpA (F) ’s largest union filed a
court challenge to the carmaker’s new labor agreement for some
Italian plants in an effort to block the changes.  The Fiom union asked a court in Turin, where Fiat is based,
to nullify the carmaker’s decision to create new companies to
manage factories, claiming Italy’s biggest manufacturer’s
positions are anti-labor, it said in an e-mailed statement
today. Fiat declined to comment.  Fiat is trying to improve productivity and capacity
utilization to stop losses in Italy, still the carmaker’s
biggest market. None of the company’s 2010 profit came from the
country, Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  has said.  “Our goal is to defend workers’ rights and annul the
accords that are against them,” Federico Bellono, the union’s
local head in Turin, said yesterday. Fiom represents about
10,000 of the carmaker’s 83,000 Italian workers.  In January, about 54 percent of workers at Mirafiori,
Fiat’s oldest factory in  Italy , voted for a 1 billion-euro
($1.43 billion) investment in the plant in exchange for measures
to limit strikes and curtail absenteeism. Marchionne had said he
might shift production abroad if the vote wasn’t approved.  About 60 percent of workers at Pomigliano near Naples,
Fiat’s least productive factory, approved a deal last June to
add shifts and institute a six-day work week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
