Spain â€™s big companies may face
higher expenses from plans to cut their workforce through early
retirement, El Pais reported, citing a draft to be sent by the
government for congressional consideration.  Big companies with profit will have to pay unemployment
benefits that have been funded by the state until now, the
Madrid-based newspaper said.  The draft still has to specify the minimum size of
companies that could be affected by the legal revisions, El Pais
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
