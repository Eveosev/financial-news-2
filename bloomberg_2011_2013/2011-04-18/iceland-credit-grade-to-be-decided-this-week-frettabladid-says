Moody’s Investors Service and
 Standard & Poor’s  will probably decide whether to cut Iceland’s
credit grade this week, Frettabladid reported, citing Finance
Minister Steingrimur J. Sigfusson.  Sigfusson and Economy Minister Arni P. Arnason met with
representatives from the two rating companies in  Washington  over
the weekend in an effort to prevent them from cutting Iceland’s
credit grade to junk, the Reykjavik-based daily said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
