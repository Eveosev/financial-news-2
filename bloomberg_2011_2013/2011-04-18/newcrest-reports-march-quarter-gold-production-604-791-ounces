Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) , Australia’s
largest gold mining company, cut its production forecast a
second time after third-quarter output fell 16 percent on heavy
rainfall in Australia and a mine shutdown in  Ivory Coast .  Output may be 2.82 million ounces in the 12 months ending
June 30, with a margin of plus or minus 35,000 ounces, the
Melbourne-based company said today in a statement. The
prediction is lower than the forecast of 2.85 million to 2.95
million ounces it made Jan. 25.  Production in the three months ended March 31 fell to
604,791 ounces from 722,783 ounces in the second quarter,
Newcrest said. The result compared with 416,651 ounces in the
third quarter last year, before Newcrest’s acquisition of Lihir
Gold Ltd. UBS AG had forecast output of 682,900 ounces.  “Extreme rain events on the east coast of  Australia 
impacted Cadia Valley operations during the March 2011
quarter,” Newcrest said. The Bonikro mine in Ivory Coast
remains suspended because of political unrest, resulting in a
production loss of 8,000 ounces a month.  Newcrest fell 0.8 percent to A$40.80 at the 4:10 p.m. close
of Sydney trading.  Copper output in the quarter was 20,098 tons, 500 tons
lower than last year. Forecast copper production stayed at
between 75,000 tons and 80,000 tons for the year.  Unseasonal rain in early February at Newcrest’s Cadia
Valley mine in New South Wales cut mining of high-grade gold for
seven weeks, the company said.  Output at Lihir in  Papua New Guinea  fell as low rainfall
limited fresh water needed to supply the processing plant,
making the gold floatation circuit unavailable for “a large
part of February and March,” Newcrest said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
