Greek two- and 10-year  government
bonds  slumped, driving yields to the highest since before the
introduction of the euro, amid concern the nation won’t be able
to avoid defaulting on its debt.  The Greek two-year note yield surged to 20 percent, the
highest borrowing cost among developed nations. Portuguese two-
and 10-year yields also reached euro-era records, even as Greek
officials said restructuring isn’t being discussed. Finnish
euro-skeptics won support in yesterday’s election as voters
protested funding euro-region bailouts. German bunds surged as
 Standard & Poor’s  put a “negative” outlook on the U.S. credit
rating, sparking demand for an alternative to Treasuries.  “Risk is one of the main drivers, with the restructuring
debate moving to the front pages again and the Finnish election
results not doing anything to deter those feelings,” said
Christopher Rieger, head of fixed-income strategy at Commerzbank
AG in  Frankfurt . “We are looking for more gains in bunds.”  Greek two-year note yields were 172 basis points higher at
20.23 percent as of 4:12 p.m. in London. The 4.6 percent
security due May 2013 fell 2.22, or 22.2 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,426) face amount, to 75.38. Ten-year bond yields climbed 74
basis points to 14.56 percent.  Rescue Renegotiation  The yield difference, or spread, between Greek 10-year
bonds and German securities of similar maturity widened 82 basis
points to 1,131 basis points, the most since at least 1998, when
Bloomberg began collecting the data. The Portuguese-German 10-
year yield spread widened to 582 basis points, also a record.  Natixis Asset Management,  France ’s fourth-largest
investment manager, said it’s buying short-dated Greek paper and
betting the nation will restructure its debt after 2013.  “We have a view that the short end of the Greek curve is
the only investible part of the Greek bond market,” Axel Botte,
a fixed-income strategist at the 538 billion-euro  fund manager ,
said. “We recommend selling outright any holdings maturing
beyond 2013.”  The 10-year German bund advanced, pushing the yield down 13
basis points to 3.25 percent, the lowest since March 24. Two-
year yields were 11 basis points lower, at 1.73 percent.  Bunds extended their gains after S&P cut its outlook on the
U.S. long-term credit rating to “negative” from ‘stable,”
saying there are risks that the nation’s leaders will fail to
deal with rising budget deficits.  “It’s pure flight-to-quality,” said  Peter Chatwell , a
fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole SA in London. “You
just lost one of the major flight-to-quality assets in
Treasuries, and that’s why bunds have done so well.”  ‘Well-Founded’  European Central Bank Council member George Provopoulos
said today that restructuring of Greece’s debt is neither
necessary or desirable. His comments echoed Finance Minister
 George Papaconstantinou , who said on April 16 that “the pain
and the cost” of restructuring the nation’s debt would be
greater than repaying lenders.  Credit-default swaps insuring Greece’s bonds jumped 66
basis points to 1,221, signaling a 64.5 percent chance of a
default within five years, while contracts tied to Portugal’s
debt climbed 18.5 basis points to 616.5, according to CMA.  Otto Fricke, the parliamentary budget spokesman for
 Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s Free Democratic Party coalition
partner, said that  Greece  may not be able to avoid restructuring
its debt before summer’s end.  Summer Outlook  “The big question is: will Greece make it through summer
without buckling and having to find some means of restructuring
its debt?” Fricke said today by phone. “The signs aren’t good,
though I defy any easy predictions.”  Portuguese 10-year bonds fell, pushing the yield as much as
28 basis points higher to 9.28 percent, the most since at least
1997. The two-year yield was 19 basis points higher at 10
percent, the first time it breached 10 percent since at least
1996, when Bloomberg began compiling the data.  European Central Bank council member Michael Bonello said
today that policy makers mustn’t raise  interest rates  at the
expense of economic growth in debt-strapped euro-area nations,
should inflation expectations remain contained.  The Frankfurt-based central bank lifted its benchmark
interest rate by 25 basis points to 1.25 percent on April 7.
Policy makers are balancing the need for higher borrowing costs
in countries like  Germany , where the economy is booming, against
soaring bond yields in the region’s heavily indebted nations.  Spanish Auctions  Expectations for two more quarter-point increases in the
ECB’s benchmark rate this year are “well founded,” council
member  Ewald Nowotny  told Bloomberg News in  Washington  on April
16. Fellow council member Luc Coene said in an interview
yesterday that monetary conditions “are too accommodative.”  Spain  sold 12- and 18-month Treasury bills today, while
 Belgium  auctioned bonds due in 2013, 2021 and 2041.  Spain’s 3.5 billion euros of 12-month Treasury bills were
sold at an average yield of 2.77 percent. Investors bid for 1.63
times the amount of securities on sale. It also sold 1.15
billion euros of 18-month bills at an average yield of 3.364
percent.  “The talk about Greek restructuring isn’t helping
sentiment,” said Eric Wand, a rates strategist at Lloyds Bank
Corporate Markets in  London . “The bid-to-cover is lower than
the last time and the yield is higher.”  Spanish CDS  Spain’s two-year notes fell, pushing the yield up as much
as 28 basis points to 3.60 percent, the most since Jan. 11. The
nation’s 10-year bond yield jumped as much as 18 basis points to
5.60 percent, also the highest since Jan. 11.  Swaps protecting Spanish notes rose 20 basis points to 254,
compared with an all-time high of 368 reached Nov. 30. The
Markit iTraxx SovX Western  Europe  Index of default swaps on 15
governments increased 10 basis points to 188, the highest in a
month, CMA prices show.  Restructuring Greek debt would “create realized losses
across the global banking system, but mainly in Europe,” said
David Zervos, head of global fixed-income strategy at Jefferies
& Co. in  New York . “Markets are rightly nervous.”  The European Union said a restructuring of Greece’s debt
“is not an option” and there are no discussions under way
about such a measure.  “Restructuring is not an option that’s on the table,”
 Chantal Hughes , an EU spokeswoman, told reporters in Brussels
today. “We don’t think it will be in any way helpful to the
 euro zone  or the European economy at large. There are no
discussions at any level” about a restructuring, Hughes said.  Belgian Auction  Greece plans to sell 1.25 billion euros of 87-day Treasury
bills tomorrow.  Belgium sold 765 million euros of bonds due in September
2013 to yield 2.637 percent, 1.245 billion euros of September
2021 debt to yield 4.357 percent and 940 million euros of March
2041 bonds to yield 4.815 percent, the debt agency said today.  The yield on the 10-year bonds compares with 4.25 percent
when the Belgian debt agency last sold the same-maturity debt in
an auction on Feb. 28, and with secondary-market yields of 4.40
percent. Demand was 1.54 times the amount of securities on offer
for the 2021 bonds, up from 1.45 times on Feb. 28.  German government bonds have handed investors a loss of 2.4
percent this year, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while
Treasuries have returned 0.4 percent. Greek debt has lost 4.3
percent and Spanish debt has gained 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
