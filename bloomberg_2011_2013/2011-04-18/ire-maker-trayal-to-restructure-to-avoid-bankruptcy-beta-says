Serbian tire and chemicals producer
Trayal Korporacija AD reached an agreement with creditors on a
restructuring program that will help it avoid bankruptcy,  Beta 
 news agency  reported, citing Deputy General Manager Nebojsa
Djenadic.  “All creditors including commercial banks, the state and
our suppliers have given their consent” to the proposed five-
year plan to repay debts, without cutting Trayal’s 2,200
workforce, according to the report.  Majority owned by Bulgarian  Brikel EAD  since 2006, the
Krusevac-based maker of rubber products and explosives had
accumulated a 17 million euro debt by February, mostly for
unpaid taxes and  customs duties .  To contact the reporter on this story:
