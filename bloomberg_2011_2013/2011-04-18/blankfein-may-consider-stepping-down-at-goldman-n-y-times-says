Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer  Lloyd Blankfein  may consider
stepping down because of fatigue from guiding the bank through
the financial crisis, the New York Times reported, citing two
unidentified persons who spoke with Blankfein.  The possibility that Blankfein might resign has prompted
speculation over who might succeed him, the newspaper added.  Top candidates to replace him include vice chairmen Michael
Sherwood, who handles much of the bank’s international business
from London, J. Michael Evans, chairman of Goldman’s Asia
business, and Gary D. Cohn, president and chief operating
officer and Blankfein’s top deputy in New York, the newspaper
said, citing three unidentified company veterans briefed on the
situation.  Blankfein, 56, may wait until the firm completes
negotiations with  Washington  over new banking regulations in the
second half this year before turning management over to a
younger team, the Times reported, citing Roger Freeman, a
financial analyst at Barclays Capital.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
