World No. 1 Rafael Nadal yesterday
won a record seventh consecutive Monte Carlo Masters tennis
title, giving the Spaniard his first tournament victory of the
year as he prepares for the  French Open .  Nadal defeated compatriot  David Ferrer , 6-4, 7-5, on his
second match point. Nadal served for the match at 6-5, with
Ferrer surviving the first match point with the help of a net-
cord.  A crosscourt forehand set up a second and Ferrer dumped the
return of Nadal’s backhand into the net to give his opponent a
record-extending 19th Masters 1000 title. It was his 37th
straight victory at the clay-court tournament -- where his last
defeat came eight years ago -- and a  44th career title .  Nadal now leads Ferrer, who is sixth in the ATP World Tour
 rankings , 12-4 on career meetings. He’d won seven straight
matches against Ferrer before his defeat in the Australian Open
quarterfinals in  Melbourne  in January.  That ended Nadal’s quest for a straight sweep of the four
Grand Slam titles. He was struggling with a hamstring-related
injury at the time.  He’s the reigning champion at the French Open, where he’ll
try to win a sixth title starting next month.  Nadal defeated Britain’s  Andy Murray  in the semifinals at
Monte Carlo, while Ferrer beat Juergen Melzer of Austria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
