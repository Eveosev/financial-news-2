German electricity for delivery
next year fell after fuels declined, signaling higher costs for
power stations in  Europe ’s biggest market.  Baseload power for 2012 slid 60 cents, or 1 percent, to
58.55 euros ($83), according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg as of 5 p.m. Berlin time. It earlier dropped to as low
as 58.25 euros. Baseload is delivered around the clock.  The contract extended last week’s 1.4 percent decline after
coal, natural-gas and  oil prices  dropped. It earlier this month
climbed to its highest price since June 2009 after Germany shut
nuclear reactors for a safety review after the nuclear disaster
in  Japan .  Hard coal for next-year delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp fell for the first time in three days, losing 1.5
percent to $129.25 a metric ton. The fuel accounted for about a
fifth of Germany’s power last year. Germany also produces
electricity from lignite, or brown coal, natural gas, wind and
solar plants.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including  GFI
Group Inc. (GFIG) , ICAP Plc, Spectron Group Ltd., Tradition and Tullet
Prebon Plc.  -- Editors: Rob Verdonck, Randall Hackley  To contact the reporter on this story:
