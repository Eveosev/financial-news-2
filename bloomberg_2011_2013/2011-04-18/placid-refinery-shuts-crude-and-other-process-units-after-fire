Placid Refining Co.’s Port Allen,
 Louisiana , refinery shut a crude unit and several other
downstream process components after a fire.  The fire began about 8:30 a.m. local time yesterday and was
extinguished by 9:45 a.m., Rafael Bermudez, an outside spokesman
for the refinery, said in a telephone interview. The company
anticipates “minimal impact on fuel supplies to its
customers,” he said.  The refinery may restart the affected units later today,
Ron Hurst, a Dallas-based vice president for the company, said
in a telephone interview. “A number of units are still
running,” he said.  The crude unit and the diesel hydrotreater were the primary
elements affected, he said.  The plant supplies  jet fuel  to the U.S. military, Bermudez
said. It has a capacity of 59,000 barrels a day, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
