South African stocks fell the most
in more than a month after the U.S.’s ratings outlook was
revised to “negative” from “stable” by Standard & Poor’s and
commodity prices fell.  Anglo American Plc (AGL)  and  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL)  led the FTSE/JSE
Africa All Share Index’s 2.6 percent retreat to 31,388.63 by the
5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, the biggest drop since March 10
and the lowest closing level in three weeks.  S&P lowered its outlook for the world’s biggest economy,
citing a “material risk” the nation’s leaders will fail to
deal with rising budget deficits and debt. The S&P GSCI index of
24 commodities slid 1.5 percent.  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , the diversified mining company that
makes up 11 percent of  South Africa ’s benchmark stock gauge,
fell to the lowest closing level since Dec. 15, losing 4.6
percent to 333 rand. BHP Billiton Plc, the world’s largest
mining company, dropped for a second day, losing 2.5 percent to
273.16 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
