The  Federal Reserve  will have a
relatively small holding of  Treasury securities  even after its
second round of bond buying concludes, according to  Carl Lantz ,
Credit Suisse AG’s head of U.S. interest-rate strategy.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks the Fed’s investment in
Treasuries as a percentage of debt held by the public, based on
a Credit Suisse analysis of government data. The chart compares
the March 31 percentage with year-end figures since 1919.  March’s level, 14.1 percent, was lower than the figures at
the end of 2000 through 2007. The highest reading during this
period was 18.4 percent, posted in 2002. The peak for the past
nine decades was 28.4 percent at the end of 1973, when the U.S.
was in a recession.  “The Fed holds a historically low share of government
debt,” Lantz wrote in an April 15 report with a similar chart.
The ratio is poised to decline to 11.9 percent by 2013, assuming
the central bank leaves its Treasury holdings stable, he wrote.  Lantz’s report sought to debunk “myths” surrounding the
Fed’s bond purchases, or quantitative easing, and the Treasury
market. They include the myth that the central bank’s share of
the market is unprecedented.  At the end of March, the Fed owned $1.3 trillion of
Treasury bills, notes and bonds. Debt held by the public, a
figure that excludes the holdings of government trust funds,
totaled $9.5 trillion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
