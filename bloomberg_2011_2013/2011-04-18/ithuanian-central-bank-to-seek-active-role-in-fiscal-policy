Lithuanian central bank Governor
Vitas Vasiliauskas, who began his five-year term today, said he
would be an “active adviser” to the government on fiscal
policy to help boost economic growth.  The government will need “unconventional decisions” with
regard to social-security policies to curb a rising fiscal
deficit, Vasiliauskas told reporters in Vilnius.  “The goal is sustainable economic growth, not explosive,”
he said.  Vasiliauskas, a former deputy finance minister who oversaw
taxation, replaced Reinoldijus Sarkinas, who led the central
bank’s board since 1996.  Lithuania pegs the litas to the euro in a currency-board
system where the central bank keeps foreign-currency reserves at
least at the level of cash in circulation to maintain the
 exchange rate .  Lietuvos Bankas  doesn’t use  interest rates  as a
policy tool.  To contact the reporter on this story:
