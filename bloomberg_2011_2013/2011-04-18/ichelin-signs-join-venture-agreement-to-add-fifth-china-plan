Michelin & Cie., the world’s
second-largest tiremaker, signed a joint venture agreement in
China to produce car and light-truck tires with  Double Coin
Holdings Ltd. (600623)   Michelin, which currently has four Chinese plants, will
take a 40 percent stake in a factory under construction to
produce tires under Double Coin’s Warrior brand, the French
tiremaker said in a statement.  Financial terms are still being negotiated for the deal,
which would add annual production capacity of 15 million tires,
spokesman Fabrice Lenica said by telephone.  Michelin, which ranks behind Bridgestone Corp. in global
production, raised 1.2 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in a share
issue last September and pledged to add plants in emerging
markets averaging annual growth of 9 percent. The Clermont-
Ferrand, France-based company wants to add low-cost Asian
operations to power its expansion, Managing Partner Jean- Dominique Senard said after he was named Feb. 11 to succeed
Chief Executive Officer Michel Rollier.  Michelin already manufactures Warrior tires under license
from Double Coin, a unit of Shanghai Huayi Group Co., and in
2009 bought out the Chinese partner’s minority stake in its
Shanghai production facilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
