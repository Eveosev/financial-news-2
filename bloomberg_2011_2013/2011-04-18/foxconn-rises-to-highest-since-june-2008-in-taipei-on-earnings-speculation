Foxconn Technology Co., which makes
casings for Apple Inc. computers, surged to the highest since
June 2008 in Taipei trading on speculation earnings will exceed
estimations, said Jeff Pu, an analyst at Fubon Securities Co.   The stock jumped 6.7 percent to NT$127 as of 10:25 a.m.,
set for the highest since June 5, 2008. The company may report
fourth-quarter earnings of NT$2.2 billion and NT$1.87 billion in
the first quarter, according to estimates of five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Foxconn will report fourth-quarter and
first-quarter results by the end of April.  Edmund Ding , the
spokesman for parent Foxconn Technology Group, didnâ€™t answer
calls to his cellphone.    To contact the reporter on this story:
