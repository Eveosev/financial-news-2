OAO Polymetal, a Russian silver and
gold producer, may miss by 10 percent its output target for gold
this year of 1 million ounces, Kommersant reported.  The company may be forced to delay the start of its
processing plant in the Amur region for “technical reasons,”
the Moscow-based newspaper said, citing an unidentified person
familiar with the matter.  Polymetal Vice President Pavel Danilin declined to comment
on the report when Bloomberg called today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
