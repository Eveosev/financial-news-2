index fell to its lowest in more than three weeks after  Standard
& Poor’s  put a “negative” outlook on its AAA rating for the
U.S., citing risks from rising budget deficits in the world’s
biggest economy.  The PX gauge of 15 companies dropped 1.5 percent to 1,221.1
as of 4:02 p.m. in  Prague , its lowest intraday level since March
