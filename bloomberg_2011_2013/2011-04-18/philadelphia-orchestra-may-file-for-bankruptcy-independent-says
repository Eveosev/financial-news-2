The Philadelphia Orchestra, one of
the premier U.S. musical ensembles, is likely to file for
 bankruptcy protection  this week, the Independent reported.  The decision was made by the board of directors on April 16
as the orchestra is at risk of running out of cash to pay its
musicians, the newspaper said.   Bankruptcy protection will give the orchestra, founded in
1900, a chance to reorganize and cut costs and future
liabilities, but the filing has been opposed by the players, on
the ground that a bankruptcy judge might allow the management to
alter the companyâ€™s pension obligations to them, the Independent
said.  The orchestra is starting a campaign to raise $160 million
from supporters, the newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
