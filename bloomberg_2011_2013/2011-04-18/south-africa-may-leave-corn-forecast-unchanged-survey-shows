South Africa , the biggest corn
producer on the continent, will probably leave its forecast for
this season’s harvest of the grain unchanged, a survey showed.  The government may say farmers will reap 10.83 million
metric tons of corn, the same as projected last month, according
to the median estimate of 13 traders surveyed by Bloomberg.
Forecasts ranged from 10.65 million tons to 10.83 million tons.  The government’s  Crop Estimates Committee  is scheduled to
release its third assessment of the harvest on April 20 at 3:30
p.m. Johannesburg time.  White corn for July delivery, the most active contract on
the South African Futures Exchange, rose 5 rand, or 0.3 percent,
to close at 1,665 rand ($243) a ton today. Meal made from the
grain is the country’s staple food.  Yellow corn for July delivery gained 5 rand, or 0.3
percent, to 1,697 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly as  animal
feed  in South Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
