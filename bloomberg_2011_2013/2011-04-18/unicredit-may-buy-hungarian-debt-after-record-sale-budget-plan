UniCredit SpA (UCG)  plans to buy
Hungarian foreign-currency bonds after the country covered most
of this year’s external funding needs in a record debt sale and
because planned spending cuts may boost its credit ratings.  “We look to re-enter Hungarian external markets as the
country tops emerging Europe, Middle East and Africa in year-to-
date coverage of external borrowing needs,”  Gyula Toth , Vienna-
based chief strategist for emerging EMEA, Middle East and Africa
at UniCredit, wrote in a research note dated yesterday.  Hungary hired UniCredit, Deutsche Bank AG and ING Groep NV
for meetings with investors that start today in Europe before a
possible debt sale, a banker involved in the arrangements said
last week. The government raised $3.75 billion in dollar
offerings on March 24, a record amount and two-thirds of the
annual plan, and an additional $500 million on April 6. For all
of 2011, it wants to sell the equivalent of 4 billion euros
($5.7 billion) of foreign-currency debt.  The European Union’s most-indebted eastern member will cap
 unemployment benefits , eliminate early retirement and cut drug
subsidies to reduce its debt and make financing sustainable,
Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  said on April 13. Hungary aims
to cut debt to 75 percent of gross domestic product by the end
of this year from over 80 percent last year, Prime Minister
 Viktor Orban  said on April 14.  “Hungary has surprised us on the upside this year,” Toth
wrote. “Should the government push ahead with its consolidation
plans, the sovereign should over the coming quarters see rating
agencies shift from their negative outlook and eventually
reverse some of the downgrades.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
