Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s
bombing of the rebel-held city of Misrata is “indiscriminate”
and has killed at least 16 civilians since April 14, Human
Rights Watch said.  One attack, apparently from a ground-to-ground Grad rocket,
killed at least eight civilians waiting in line for bread, while
another, from a possible mortar round, injured four at a medical
clinic, the New York-based group said in an e-mailed statement
today.  “Libyan government forces have repeatedly fired mortars
and Grad rockets into residential neighborhoods in Misrata,
causing civilian casualties,” said Peter Bouckaert, emergencies
director at Human Rights Watch. “The Soviet-made Grad in
particular is one of the world’s most inaccurate rocket systems
and should never be fired in areas with civilians.”  Qaddafi is fighting a rebellion that seeks to end his four-
decade rule. The attacks on Misrata, the main rebel-held city in
the west, have made  Libya ’s third-largest city a symbol of the
limitations of NATO’s air campaign to protect civilians.  Human Rights Watch  said in the statement that it didn’t
find evidence of rebel activity in the areas that came under
attack in Misrata.  To contact the reporters on this story:
