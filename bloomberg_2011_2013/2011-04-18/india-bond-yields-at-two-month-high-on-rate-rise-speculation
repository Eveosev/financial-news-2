India ’s bond yields rose to a two-
month high after inflation exceeded the central bank’s forecast,
fueling speculation the monetary authority will boost borrowing
costs for a third time this year.  The wholesale  price index  rose 8.98 percent in March from a
year earlier, compared with 8.31 percent in February, according
to data published by the commerce ministry on April 15. The
 Reserve Bank  of India had predicted inflation of 8 percent at
the end of March. The next interest rate review will be on May 3.  “Inflation concerns are worrying investors,” said R.S.
Chauhan, chief dealer of fixed-income and currency at  State Bank 
of Bikaner & Jaipur in Mumbai. “Another rate hike is definitely
on the cards and I won’t be surprised if the lending rate is
increased by 50 basis points.”  The yield on the 8.08 percent note due August 2022, the most-
traded government debt, rose three basis points to 8.27 percent
as of 9:47 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. The rate is the highest since Feb. 7.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose five basis points to 7.77 percent, the highest level since
October 2008.  The repurchase auction rate, at which lenders borrow from
the central bank, was raised by 25 basis points, or 0.25
percentage point, to 6.75 percent in March. The rate has
increased by two percentage points since the beginning of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
