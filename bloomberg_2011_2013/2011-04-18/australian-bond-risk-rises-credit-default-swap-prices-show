The cost of protecting Australian
corporate bonds from default increased, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 1 basis point to
106.5 basis points as of 10:48 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Credit Agricole CIB. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50
investment-grade borrowers outside  Japan  was little changed at
106 basis points as of 8:48 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole
prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was also little changed at
130 as of 9:48 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
