The Bank of  Japan  will raise its
inflation forecast for the year ending March 2012 in a semi-
annual report due April 28, according to four people familiar
with the matter.  An estimate for an increase of about 0.5 percent in
consumer prices will replace a January forecast of 0.3 percent,
according to two of the people, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity because the discussions are private. The policy board
may tweak language related to  price stability  in the report, two
people said.  The policy board will continue to say that its members see
stable prices as being in a positive range of 2 percent or lower.
It will drop a reference to “most” board members seeing the mid-
point in the range as being at about 1 percent. Instead, the
report will indicate that the board as a whole holds that view,
the people familiar said.  Economists including Yasunari Ueno at Mizuho Securities Co.
said the tweaking is possible after the March departure of
Miyako Suda, a board member who had said she had a “much lower”
definition.  Higher commodity costs are the reason for the revision to
the inflation estimate, and not the March earthquake that left
more than 27,000 people dead or missing, the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
