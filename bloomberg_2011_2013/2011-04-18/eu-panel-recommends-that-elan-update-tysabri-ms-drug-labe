A European regulatory panel
recommended that Elan Corp. change the label of its Tysabri
multiple sclerosis drug to include an additional risk factor,
the anti-JC virus antibody status.  The EUâ€™s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or
CHMP, adopted a positive opinion for the inclusion of the
antibody status, Dublin-based Elan said in a statement today.  The CHMP, whose advice is generally followed by EU
regulators, also ruled positively on the five-year renewal of
the marketing authorization for Tysabri, the company said.  The shares rose as much as 3.4 percent in Dublin and traded
at 5.42 euros, up 1.9 percent, giving the company a market value
of 3.2 billion euros ($4.6 billion).  -- Editors: Jerrold Colten, Tom Lavell  To contact the reporter on this story:
