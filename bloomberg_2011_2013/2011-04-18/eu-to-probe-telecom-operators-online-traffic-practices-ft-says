European Union Media Commissioner
Neelie Kroes will on April 19 announce the first Europe-wide
regulatory probe into the online data traffic management
practices of telecommunications operators, the Financial Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The probe will examine whether fixed-line and mobile
operators are giving customers sufficient information about
traffic management policies, which can affect the speed of
internet connections, and the investigation may result in new,
so-called “net neutrality” rules, a concept under which all
internet traffic should be treated equally, Kroes will say,
according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
