The South Korean won was little
changed, paring earlier gains, on concern foreign investors will
sell the currency after receiving dividends and transfer money
out of the country.  The won earlier advanced as much as 0.3 percent against the
dollar after improving consumer sentiment and U.S. industrial
production boosted optimism in the global economy. Asian stocks
swung between gains and losses after  China  raised banks’ reserve
requirements to curb inflation.  “Foreign investors may buy dollars to repatriate their
dividend income,” said Cho Young Bok, currency dealer at Daegu
Bank in  Seoul . “Currency-market players are closely monitoring
the movements of the stock market, as the drop in stocks may
translate into foreigners’ selling.”  The won fell 0.1 percent to 1,090.46 per dollar as of 9:56
a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
declined 0.6 percent last week, the first drop in four weeks.  Government bonds  gained, with the yield on South Korea’s 3
percent bond due December 2013 down three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 3.70 percent, according to prices from
Korea Exchange Inc.  Pacific Investment Management Co. said it is bullish on
Asia and betting against U.S. Treasuries. The  Singapore dollar 
should strengthen as central banks in the region use currency
appreciation to fight inflation, according to a  report  by Chia Liang Lian, a portfolio manager for Pimco in  Singapore . South
Korea’s won and China’s yuan are “undervalued,” the report
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
