Lubrizol Corp. (LZ) , the engine-
additives maker selling itself to  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , said Chief Executive Officer James Hambrick is
committed to running the business for “several more years.”  “James has made a verbal commitment to both Warren, as
well as to all Lubrizol employees, that he will remain with the
company after the sale,” Lubrizol said today in a regulatory
filing. “At 56, James looks forward to several more years of
capable service to Lubrizol. Helping grow Lubrizol for the
future has been a huge part of his life and something he is
passionate about. This is unlikely to change anytime soon.”  Buffett, 80, relies on the CEOs of Berkshire’s more than 70
subsidiaries to run businesses ranging from manufacturing and
energy to consumer goods and insurance. Buffett, chairman and
CEO of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, agreed in March to buy
Lubrizol for about $9 billion. In a March 14 statement, Buffett
called Hambrick “a talented CEO.”  “Our only instruction to James -- just keep doing for us
what you have done so successfully for your shareholders,”
Buffett said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
