Desire Petroleum Plc (DES) , the U.K.
explorer focused on the North Falkland Basin, fell to a seven-
year low after plugging and abandoning the Ninky well.  Shares slumped 63 percent to 15 pence in  London , the lowest
since May 2004.  Rockhopper Exploration Plc (RKH) , which holds 7.5
percent in the well, fell 6.5 percent to 233.5 pence.  “Ninky, Desire’s final well in the current campaign, has
been plugged and abandoned with only oil shows and poor
reservoir quality,” David Farrell, an analyst at Evolution
Securities Ltd., said in an e-mailed note. “All six wells
drilled to date have been unsuccessful.”  Ninky was drilled to 2,620 meters (8,600 feet), the company
said in a statement. “No valid pressures were obtained,
indicating the reservoirs are low permeability at this
location,” it said.  On completion of Ninky, Desire will have about $37 million
available, “insufficient to drill further wells,” Chairman
Stephen Phipps said in the statement. “We will review all
financing options available with the intention of rejoining the
drilling campaign later in the year if possible.”  Argos Resources Ltd. (ARG) , which is also exploring for oil and
gas off the Falklands, fell 0.8 percent to 31.5 pence in London.
Exploration wells will be drilled in 2011 or 2012, the company
said today in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
