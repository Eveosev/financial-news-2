South Africa  will auction 2.1
billion rand ($305.3 million) of 10-year and 30-year bonds
tomorrow, a day before the release of a report that may show
prices accelerated at the fastest pace in 10 months.  The  Reserve Bank  will offer 1.3 billion rand of 6.75
percent bonds due 2021, and 800 million rand of 6.5 percent
securities maturing in 2041 at its weekly auction, the Pretoria-
based central bank said on its Bloomberg page.  The consumer price index in  Africa ’s biggest economy likely
rose 4 percent in March from a year earlier, compared with 3.7
percent in February, according to the median estimate of 21
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Rising inflation reduces real
returns on fixed-interest investments.  “You’ve seen some volatility in yields” as investors
positioned themselves before the release of the inflation data,
said Deon van Zyl, who oversees about 13 billion rand of debt as
head of fixed-interest investments at Cape Town-based
Metropolitan Asset Managers.  Concern about the U.S.’s budget deficit may damp demand for
debt, Van Zyl said.  Standard & Poor’s  put a “negative” outlook
on the U.S.’s AAA credit rating, citing rising budget deficits
and debt.  “The longer end especially may come under pressure” at
the auction, he said.  The 10-year bonds dropped the most in a week, losing 45
cents to 87.99 rand, driving the yield up seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 8.57 percent as of 4:46 p.m. in
Johannesburg. The 30-year securities fell, raising the yield by
one basis point to 8.91 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
