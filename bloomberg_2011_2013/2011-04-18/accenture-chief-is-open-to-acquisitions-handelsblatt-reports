Accenture PLC (ACN)  will be more open to
acquisitions than it was in the past,  Handelsblatt  cited Chief
Executive Officer Pierre Nanterme as saying.  Nanterme said that, while organic growth “is and remains
our primary strategy,” he will consider “tactical acquisitions
that add specialties,” the newspaper reported, citing an
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
