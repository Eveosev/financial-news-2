Huawei Technologies Co.,  China ’s
largest maker of phone equipment, narrowed the gap with global
market leader Ericsson AB to about two weeks of sales after
revenue almost tripled in the past five years.  Growth in international sales raised Huawei’s total revenue
to 185.2 billion yuan last year, from 66.4 billion yuan in 2006,
the Shenzhen-based company said in its annual report today.
That’s about $27.36 billion, based on the average  exchange rate 
for the yuan to the dollar last year. Ericsson’s 203.3 billion
Swedish krona in sales were equal to about $28.3 billion at the
average exchange rate.  Chief Executive Officer Ren Zhengfei, who founded the
company in 1987, initially led Huawei outside of China through
sales to  Asia  and  Africa  and is now increasingly focused on
winning sales in  Europe  and the U.S. Employee-owned Huawei got
65 percent of its revenue from international markets last year,
up from 60 percent in 2009, according to data in the report.  “What’s still missing for Huawei is the U.S.,” Duncan Clark, chairman of BDA China, a Beijing-based technology
consultancy, said in an interview today. “It’s pretty
impressive the company can almost become a global leader without
the U.S. market. Huawei is in the top tier now and with free
access to the U.S., it would become very much the top dog.”  U.S. Expansion  The company’s efforts to expand in the U.S. for the past
three years have run into opposition from U.S. lawmakers. In
February, Huawei dropped plans to purchase patents from  Santa
Clara , California-based 3Leaf Systems to comply with a
recommendation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the
U.S. Prior to 3Leaf, Huawei failed in bids to acquire companies
including 3Com Corp. in 2008 and 2Wire Inc. last year.  Huawei began disclosing biographies of its board directors
to highlight “Huawei’s continuing efforts towards enhancing
openness and transparency.”  Board members include Chairwoman Sun Yafang, four deputy
chairmen and four executive directors, including Chief Financial
Officer Meng Wanzhou. Meng was identified as Ren’s daughter by
the website Caixin in October. Huawei spokesman Ross Gan didn’t
respond to requests for information on whether Meng and Ren are
related.  While Huawei’s sales have grown 179 percent since 2006,
Stockholm-based Ericsson’s have increased 13 percent in the same
period, according to the companies’ annual reports.  Narrowing Gap  In U.S. dollar terms, the remaining gap in total revenue of
about $930 million between Ericsson and Huawei is equal to less
than two-week’s worth of Huawei’s weekly sales of about $526
million last year, according to Bloomberg calculations of data
supplied in the annual report.  Based on current exchange rates, the value of Ericsson’s
2010 sales were 16 percent larger than Huawei’s.  Huawei held about 15.7 percent of the $78.6 billion global
market for carrier network infrastructure last year, second to
Ericsson’s 19.6 percent share, according to estimates from
research firm Gartner Inc. on April 11.  Huawei, which didn’t win its first contract outside China
until 1997, achieved international sales of more than $100
million by 2000. Overseas business exceeded contracts in China
for the first time in 2005, according to the company’s website.  Employee-Owned  Huawei’s international sales jumped 34 percent to 120.4
billion yuan last year, the annual report said. Its sales in
China gained 9.7 percent to 64.8 billion yuan. The China market
declined to 35 percent of Huawei’s sales last year, from 40
percent in 2009.  Net income rose 30 percent to 23.8 billion yuan, from 18.3
billion yuan a year earlier, Huawei’s report said.  Huawei’s website says the company is employee-owned and the
Chinese government holds no shares. The company has 110,000
employees, the annual report said.  Ren retired from China’s army in 1983 as a deputy director
of the military’s Engineering Corps, the annual report said. He
established Huawei with 21,000 yuan of capital, according to the
report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
