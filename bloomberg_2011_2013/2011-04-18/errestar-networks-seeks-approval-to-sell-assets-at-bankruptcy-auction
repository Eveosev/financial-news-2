TerreStar Networks Inc., a mobile
communications company in bankruptcy, asked for court permission
to sell its assets at an auction after an earlier deal with
 Echostar Corp. (SATS)  fell apart.  TerreStar is seeking to put its assets up for sale at a
June 15 auction, according to an April 15 court filing in  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court  in New York.  “All signs indicate that an open sale process is the most
value-maximizing alternative here,” the company said in court
papers.  TerreStar, based in Reston, Virginia, filed for bankruptcy
last year with a restructuring plan backed by creditor EchoStar.
TerreStar, which uses a satellite network to provide mobile-
communications service, withdrew the plan after it said it
didn’t have creditor support for the deal.  The case is In re TerreStar Networks Inc., 10-15446, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan)  To contact the reporter on this story:
