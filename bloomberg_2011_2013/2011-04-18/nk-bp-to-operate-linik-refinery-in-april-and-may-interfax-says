TNK-BP, the oil venture half owned
by  BP Plc (BP/) , will operate its Linik refinery in  Ukraine  in April
and May,  Interfax  reported, citing the companyâ€™s Chairman Didier Casimiro.  Casimiro said that TNK-BP considers whether to halt the
refinery every month, according to Interfax.  TNK-BP refining operations in Ukraine are suffering because
of cheap imports from Belarus and Kazakhstan, the  International
Energy Agency  said in February. The company said the same month
that it expects to lose $150 million this year on the Linik
facility if conditions were unchanged and threatened to close
the plant at the end of March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
