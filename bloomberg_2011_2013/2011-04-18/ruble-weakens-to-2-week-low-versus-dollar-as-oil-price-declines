The ruble depreciated to its lowest
versus the dollar in almost two weeks as Urals,  Russia ’s export
blend of crude, fell for the first time in three days.  The Russian currency lost 0.5 percent to 28.2900 per dollar
at the 5 p.m. close of trading in Moscow, its weakest since
April 5, and strengthened 0.5 percent to 40.3825 per euro,
leaving it at 33.7316 against the central bank’s dollar-euro
basket, a gain of 0.05 percent.  “Appreciation pressures backed by higher  oil prices  are
still too strong for the ruble to start a weakening trend,”
 Alexander Morozov  and Artem Biryukov, economists at HSBC
Holdings Plc in Moscow, wrote in an e-mailed report today.
“Depreciation pressures on the ruble” are likely to build up
in the second half, they wrote.  Urals traded own 0.5 percent at $119 a barrel from this
month’s high of 122.88 on April 8, Bloomberg data show. The
ruble has gained about 8 percent against the dollar so far this
year, making Russia’s currency the best performer among the so-
called BRICs.  Brazil ’s real has appreciated 4.2 percent,  China ’s
yuan is up 1.2 percent and the  Indian rupee , 0.6 percent.  HSBC says the ruble’s current “equilibrium” level against
the basket is 33.70. The currency is like to weaken to 34.4
against the basket by the end of the second quarter, according
to the report.  “Higher oil prices fail to sustain the ruble strengthening
on a sustainable basis,” Morozov and Biryukov wrote.
“Macroeconomic fundamentals, in particular high inflation and
capital outflow related to a poor investment climate, should be
accountable for that.”  Urals oil closed 2011 at 92.20 a barrel. It has averaged
$104.93 a barrel this year, Bloomberg data show. Inflation
slowed to an annual 9.5 percent in February from 9.6 percent the
previous month, the highest level since Oct. 2009. Annual
consumer-price growth was unchanged at 9.5 percent in March,
according to the Federal Statistics Service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
