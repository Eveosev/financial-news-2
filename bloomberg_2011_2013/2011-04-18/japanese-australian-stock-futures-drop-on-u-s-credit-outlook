Japanese and Australian stock
futures fell after Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service cut the
U.S. long-term credit outlook to negative, fueling concern that
a recovery in the global economy may slow.  American depositary receipts of Toyota Motor Corp., the
world’s No. 1 carmaker, dropped 0.5 percent yesterday in  New
York . Those of Canon Inc., which gets about 80 percent of its
sales abroad, sank 1.2 percent after the yen gained, clouding
the earnings outlook for the camera maker. ADRs of BHP Billiton
Ltd., Australia’s biggest oil producer, dropped 1.8 percent
after oil and metal prices declined.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,490 in  Chicago  yesterday, compared with 9,560
in Osaka, Japan. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index lost 1
percent.  “The cut in the U.S. credit rating is a negative
surprise,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based
SMBC Friend Securities Co. “The yen has been rising and that’s
a headwind for exporters.”  In New York, Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 1.1 percent
yesterday, its biggest retreat since March, after S&P lowered
its outlook on  U.S. debt  to “negative.” The U.S. government
risks losing its AAA credit rating unless policy makers agree on
a plan by 2013 to reduce budget deficits and the national debt,
the ratings agency said.  ‘Material Risk’  “We believe there is a material risk that U.S. policy
makers might not reach an agreement on how to address medium-and
long-term budgetary challenges by 2013,” New York-based S&P
said in a report yesterday. “If an agreement is not reached and
meaningful implementation does not begin by then, this would in
our view render the U.S. fiscal profile meaningfully weaker than
that of peer ‘AAA’ sovereigns.”  The yen rose against the dollar and euro for a fourth day
as investors flocked to safer assets on concern Europe’s debt
crisis is worsening and after the downgrade to the outlook for
the U.S.’s credit rating.  Japan ’s currency appreciated to as high as 82.19 against
the dollar overnight, compared with 82.91 at the close of  stock
trading  in  Tokyo  yesterday. Against the euro, the yen
strengthened to 116.48 today from 119.16, as yields on Greece’s
two-year notes increased to 20 percent for the first time since
the 17-nation currency debuted. A stronger yen cuts the value of
overseas income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Crude oil for May delivery slid $2.54 to settle at $107.12
a barrel in New York yesterday, falling for the first time in
four days after  Saudi Arabia , the world’s biggest crude
exporter, said the global market has enough supplies to meet
demand. The London Metal Exchange Index of six metals slumped
1.9 percent yesterday, the lowest since March 16.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 1.5 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 3.8 percent by the S&P
500 and 1 percent by the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.4 times for the S&P 500 and 10.9 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
