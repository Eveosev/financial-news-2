Hochtief AG (HOT) , which is poised to
cede control to Actividades de Construccion & Servicios SA, said
Burkhard Lohr quit his role of chief financial officer, the
second executive board member to announce his resignation this
month.  Lohr, whose departure becomes effective Oct. 18, is making
use of his right of termination after Spanish builder increased
its stake in the German company to more than 30 percent, Essen-
based Hochtief said today in an e-mailed statement.  Chief Executive Officer Herbert Luetkestratkoetter said on
April 11 he will leave following Hochtief’s annual shareholders
meeting on May 12. ACS, which is pursuing a hostile takeover of
the German builder, plans to raise its stake to more than 50
percent, it has said.  Luetkestratkoetter will be replaced by Frank Stieler,
Hochtief said on April 11. The German builder didn’t say who
will replace Lohr, who is 48.  To contact the reporter on this story:
