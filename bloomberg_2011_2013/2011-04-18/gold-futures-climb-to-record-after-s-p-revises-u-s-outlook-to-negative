Gold futures rose to a record
$1,498.60 an ounce after  Standard & Poor’s  revised its U.S.
credit outlook to negative, boosting the appeal of the precious
metal as an alternative to the dollar.  S&P changed its long-term rating from stable, citing
“material risk” that policy makers won’t reach an accord on
“medium- and long-term budgetary challenges.” Gold has gained
31 percent in the past year, and silver has more than doubled,
partly on concern that  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis would
escalate.  “The odds are increasing that we’re going to see a credit
downgrade in the next few years,” said  Matthew Zeman , a
strategist at Kingsview Financial in Chicago. “More and more
people are looking to gold as the ultimate currency.”  Gold futures for June delivery rose $6.90, or 0.5 percent,
to settle at $1,492.90 at 2:04 p.m. on the Comex in New York. In
 London , gold for immediate delivery rose as much as 0.8 percent
to a record $1,497.90.  The Treasury Department has projected that the government
will reach the $14.3 trillion debt-ceiling limit no later than
May 16 and run out of options for avoiding default by early
July.  “The perception that a downgrade would even be possible
for the U.S. is driving the gold market,” said  Frank McGhee ,
the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago.
“The dollar is going to get whacked.”  The  Federal Reserve  has kept its benchmark interest rate at
zero percent to 0.25 percent since December 2008 and has pledged
to buy $600 billion in Treasuries through June to stimulate
growth.  Dollar ‘Debasement’  “People are looking at inflation and at deficits and
feeling there’s no way to get out of this without the debasement
of the currency,” Zeman of Kingsview said.  The  European Central Bank  this month raised its main rate
to 1.25 percent from a record 1 percent to stem inflation. Debt
woes in Portugal and Ireland have escalated.  Some investors sold gold to cover losses in other markets.
U.S. equities headed for the biggest drop in a month. In the
past four weeks, gold climbed almost 5 percent, and silver
surged 21 percent.  “With the magnitude of the drop in stocks, a lot of
traders are booking profit in the metals,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in
Chicago.  Silver futures for May delivery rose 38.5 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $42.956 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, the price
reached $43.56, the highest since 1980.  Palladium futures for June delivery fell $29, or 3.8
percent, to $739.10 an ounce on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange, the biggest decline in a month.  Platinum futures for July delivery dropped $12, or 0.7
percent, to $1,782.80 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
