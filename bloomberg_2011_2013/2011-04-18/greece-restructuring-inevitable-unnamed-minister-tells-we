Restructuring of  Greece â€™s debt is
inevitable and only a question of time,  Die Welt  cited a serving
Greek government minister as saying, without naming the
minister.  European leaders told Greece in late 2010 that the country
needed to implement reforms and savings measures before any
restructuring could be discussed, the German newspaper quoted
the minister as saying in an e-mailed preview of an article to
be published tomorrow. Greece has done what was required of it,
Die Welt cited the minister, described as a confidant of Prime
Minister  George Papandreou , as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
