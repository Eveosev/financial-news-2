Slovak banks have enough capital to
cope with macroeconomic shocks, the central bank in the east
European euro-region member said, citing stress-test results.  Under a scenario assuming further worsening of the fiscal
position of some euro countries, all banks active in
Slovakia would have enough capital to cope with potential
losses, the Bratislava-based  Narodna Banka Slovenska  said in a
report published today. The scenario foresees a 6.9 percent
contraction of the economy mainly due to vanishing foreign
demand.  In a second scenario, which foresees an “excessive”
rise in commodity prices, one bank may need additional capital
as its capital-adequacy ratio would fall below 8 percent of
risk-weighted assets, the bank said without naming the lender.
The so-called “supply-side inflation” scenario assumes a 2
Percentage-point increase in the  European Central Bank ’s key
rate resulting in a 5.5 percent contraction of the Slovak
economy.  The economy will expand 3.4 percent this year and 4.8
percent in 2012, the Finance Ministry forecasts. Combined after-
tax income for 26 banks operating in the country doubled to 514
million euros ($729 million) last year from 250 million in 2009,
the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
