Mauritius Telecom , in which  France
Telecom SA (FTE)  holds 40 percent, plans to start trading its shares
on the Indian Ocean island nation’s bourse, pending approval
from the government, Chairman Appalsamy Thomas said.  “We are waiting for the decision from the Ministry of
Finance,” Thomas told reporters today in the capital, Port
Louis. “Once it’s obtained, it will take us four months before
listing.”  The government,  State Bank of Mauritius Ltd. (SBM) , the country’s
second-biggest lender, and the National Pension Fund will reduce
their stakes in the company through the listing, according to
Thomas. About 10 percent to 15 percent of shares will be traded
on the nation’s exchange, Chief Financial Officer Cyprien Mateos
said.  France Telecom  bought 40 percent of the operator for 7
billion rupees ($252.7 million) in 2001, Mauritius Telecom Chief
Executive Officer Sarat Dutt Lallah said. The company’s total
assets were valued at 15 billion rupees, it said in its annual
report distributed today.  Mauritius Telecom’s profit after tax increased 16 percent
to 1.7 billion rupees in the year through December, it said
today. Revenue at the company, the nation’s only fixed-line
operator, advanced 4.7 percent to 7.5 billion rupees.  The company plans to invest as much as 4.3 billion rupees,
or 50 percent of its reserves, in international projects, Thomas
said.  “We have sufficient reserves, which need to be spent
wisely,” he said. “We are now in talks with telecommunications
providers in Uganda and Vanuatu.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
