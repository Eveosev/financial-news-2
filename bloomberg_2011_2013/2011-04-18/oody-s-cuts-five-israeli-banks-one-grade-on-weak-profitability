Five banks in  Israel , including
 Bank Hapoalim BM (POLI) , had their credit ratings cut one level by
Moody’s Investors Services on expectations that their
profitability will remain “weak.”  Bank Hapoalim,  Bank Leumi  and Mizrahi Tefahot Bank had
their ratings cut to A2 from A1, Moody’s said in an e-mailed
statement today. First International Bank of Israel and Israel
Discount Bank had their rating cut to A3 from A2.  The banks’ “moderate earnings-generating capacity prevents
significant capital build-up which, in turn, hinders loss-
absorption capacity,” Moody’s said. The banks capacity to
absorb losses is hampered by their “highly concentrated loan
books,” and concerns over the performance of the housing
market, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
