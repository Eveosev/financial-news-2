Belgian Finance Minister  Didier Reynders  said that the latest debt and deficit figures published
by the  International Monetary Fund  are “encouraging” for
Belgium, Belga news agency reported, citing a telephone
interview.  “As far as debt is concerned, Belgium finds itself in 2011
in a better position than 2006,” Reynders said. The country’s
situation is “more favorable than that of the majority of the
euro zone” and “close to that of France and Germany,” Belga
cited the minister as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
