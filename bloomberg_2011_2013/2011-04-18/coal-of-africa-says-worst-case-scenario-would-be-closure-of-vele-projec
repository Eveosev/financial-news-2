Coal of Africa Ltd. (CZA)  said only the
“worst case scenario” would result in it abandoning its Vele
coal project in  South Africa .  “The Vele mine project has not been abandoned and we
continue to engage with the regulatory authorities regarding the
lifting of the compliance notice,” Chief Executive Officer John Wallington said. “Should the compliance notice not be lifted,
we would have no option but to close the colliery.”  This would be the “worst case scenario” and the company
is committed to finding a balance between environmental
conservation and mining, Wallington said in an e-mailed response
to questions today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
