Hungarian shares fell the most
since November and bonds had their biggest drop in five weeks
after  Standard & Poor’s  revised its rating outlook for  U.S.
government debt  to negative from stable.  The benchmark BUX index of shares slid 3.8 percent to
23,276.19 by 4:15 p.m. in Budapest, the biggest drop since Nov.
26 on an intraday basis.  OTP Bank Nyrt., the country’s largest
lender, fell 4.7 percent to 5,947 forint. Government notes
maturing in 2020 decreased, lifting the yield 11 basis points,
or 0.11 percentage point, to 7.23 percent, the biggest climb
since March 10.  “We are clearly weakening on the news,” said Andras Sovany, a fixed-income trader at ING Groep NV in Budapest. “The
market is repricing risk and for now it is fleeing toward cash
from emerging markets,” Sovany said by e-mail.  The forint slumped 0.5 percent to 268.43 per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
