John F. W. Rogers,  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) ’s chief of staff, has $33.6 million of the firm’s
stock, according to a regulatory filing that disclosed his
holdings for the first time.  Edith W. Cooper, the global head of human capital
management, held stock worth $19.4 million, according to a
separate filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The values are based on the company’s closing stock
price of $155.13 on April 15 in  New York .  Cooper and Rogers, who each have worked at Goldman Sachs
for more than 14 years and were promoted to partner in 2000, had
to disclose their holdings because they became executive
officers this month. They’re among 12  executive officers ,
including Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn.  Cooper, 49, and Rogers, 55, already were on the firm’s
management committee and Rogers is chairman of the boards of the
 Goldman Sachs Foundation  and  Goldman Sachs Gives , both
philanthropies.  Stephen Cohen , a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on behalf of Rogers and Cooper, and the firm.  In addition to stock the executives already own, the

shares and Cooper has options to buy 133,147.  Reagan, Bush  Rogers, who worked in the administrations of presidents
