It’s unlikely that any political
agreement reached in the coming months to cut the U.S.
government’s budget deficit will go far enough, said David Beers, Standard & Poor’s global head of sovereign and
international public finance ratings.  “It’s highly unlikely that whatever agreement that
Congress and the administration might make over the next couple
of months is going to be sufficient to turn the tide on the
upward debt trajectory in the U.S., which you could argue is
diverging from its triple-A peers,” Beers said in an interview
on Bloomberg Television’s “InsideTrack” with  Carol Massar ,
 Peter Cook , Dominic Chu and Jon Erlichman.  S&P today lowered its outlook to “negative” from
“stable” on the U.S.’s AAA rating, citing a “material risk”
that President  Barack Obama  and congressional leaders might not
reach an agreement on how to address medium- and long-term
budgetary challenges by 2013. The change signals the ratings
company sees at least a 1 in 3 chance the top debt rating on the
world’s largest economy will be cut within two years, Beers
said.  Obama announced a plan April 13 to cut $4 trillion in
cumulative deficits within 12 years through a combination of
spending cuts and tax increases. He said he assigned Vice
President  Joe Biden  to meet with Democratic and Republican
congressional leaders with the aim of reaching an agreement by
the end of June. The House passed a Republican budget that would
reduce spending by more than $6 billion over a decade on April
15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
