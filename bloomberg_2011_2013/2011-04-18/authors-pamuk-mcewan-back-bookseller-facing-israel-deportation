At Munther Fahmi’s small bookshop
in East Jerusalem, Martina Quick, political counselor at the
Swedish embassy to  Israel , peruses a copy of Palestinian
academic Sari Nusseibeh’s autobiography “Once Upon A Country.”  “This is the best bookshop in the country,” says the
blond, bespectacled Quick, 39. “It has the most varied
selection in English about the region, including fiction, non-
fiction, memoirs and travel writing. My boss, Foreign Minister
Carl Bildt, feels the same way and he really knows bookstores.”  The renown of Fahmi’s shop, located at the American Colony
Hotel, has spread to an international clientele far beyond the
borders of Jerusalem. Now those patrons are rallying behind its
Jerusalem-born owner, who faces possible deportation by Israeli
authorities.  A petition has been sent to the Interior Ministry citing
the “importance of his bookshop to the literary life of
 Jerusalem .” It has attracted more than 3,000 signatories:
authors, academics and political figures including Amos Oz,
Orhan Pamuk, Ian McEwan, Roddy Doyle, Henning Mankell, Nathan
Englander, Alain de Botton, John Banville, and two former
Israeli ministers, Shlomo Ben-Ami and Efraim Sneh.  Fahmi, 56, was told last year that the ministry would no
longer renew the tourist visa that has enabled him to remain in
Israel since he returned from a 20-year stay in the U.S.  Humanitarian Appeal  An appeal was rejected by Israel’s High Court of Justice,
which referred the case back to the ministry. “If a request is
forwarded for an inter-ministerial discussion on humanitarian
grounds, the issue will be examined according to procedures,”
the ministry said in an e-mailed statement.  Fahmi’s case isn’t unique, and is a result of the political
complexities created by Israel’s annexation of the eastern half
of Jerusalem after the 1967 War, a move not recognized
internationally.  Israel offered the Palestinian population the choice of
either obtaining Israeli citizenship or retaining permanent
residency status. The majority of Jerusalem’s 268,000 Arabs have
chosen the latter.  Israeli law allows for residency permits to be revoked if
the bearer remains outside the country for more than seven years
and holds another citizenship.  According to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel
(ACRI), the pace of residency permit revocations for Jerusalem
Arabs who meet those criteria has climbed, reaching a record
4,577 in 2008 after just 229 the previous year.  Court Petition  On April 7, ACRI petitioned the  High Court  to halt the
revocation of residence permits and demand that the law “be
amended to differentiate between immigrants and those born in
annexed areas.”  Fahmi first left his hometown in 1973 to study English
literature in  Egypt , and emigrated to the U.S. where several
members of his family were living. In 1993, inspired by the
signing of the Oslo Accords between Israelis and Palestinians,
he returned to Jerusalem despite having lost his residency
status in the meantime.  He opened a bookshop at the American Colony Hotel, which
was founded in the 1880s as a home for Protestant missionaries
in the Holy Land. Just over the 1967 dividing line in the city’s
eastern Arab half, it has long served as a neutral meeting
ground for Palestinian, Israeli and international officials, and
is a favorite of visiting journalists and celebrities.  Fahmi’s bookshop offers hard-to-find tomes on Middle East
politics, culture and travel, helping to promote the work of
Palestinian and Israeli authors.  Photo Event  This month, the shop hosted an event “Zoom In: Palestinian
Refugees of 1948, Remembrances,” in which Israeli and
Palestinian scholars examine contemporary reactions to archival
photographs. It is the only store in the country offering the
book for sale.  “Munther’s bookshop contributes much to that special
atmosphere at the American Colony as a meeting point for the
Jews and Arabs of Jerusalem,” says Menachem Klein, an author of
“Zoom In” and political science professor at  Bar-Ilan
University  outside  Tel Aviv . “I hope the committee that decides
his case takes this into account; Jerusalem needs more people
like Munther.”  “I don’t have any regrets at all,” Fahmi says. “I was
born here, I belong here, and I enjoy immensely what I do, being
around books and authors; there’s no way to describe the joy I
feel doing what I do for a living as a bookseller.”  (Calev Ben-David writes for Bloomberg News. The opinions
