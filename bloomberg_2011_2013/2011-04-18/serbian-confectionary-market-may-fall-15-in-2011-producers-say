Dwindling demand and rising
commodity prices may cause  Serbia ’s confectionary market to
contract as much as 15 percent in 2011, a group of leading
producers said.  The predicted decline to 105,000 tons, from 123,800 tons
last year, compares with 135,700 tons in 2007, as purchasing
power in the Balkan nation of 7.3 million people shows no
recovery, said Miroljub Aleksic, President of Belgrade-based
sweets maker  Pionir d.o.o . Pionir accounts for a quarter of the
country’s total output.  “We are being squeezed between rising cost of cocoa and
sugar and diminishing disposable income,” Aleksic said at the
 Serbian Chamber of Commerce  today. “Consumers have less and
less to spend on sweets.”  Sugar prices in Serbia have increased almost 50 percent
over the past seven months amid double-digit inflation, he said.  The $372 million-a-year industry in Serbia managed to
export 35.7 percent of its output last year, or 44,200 tons,
mostly to Bosnia,  Croatia , Macedonia, Montenegro, Albania and
other members of the Central European Free Trade Agreement,
according to an industry report presented by Aleksic.  Exports may mark “modest growth, a few percentage
points” this year as confectioners turn to Russian, Kazakh and
Belarus markets where Serbia also has free-trade access, Aleksic
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
