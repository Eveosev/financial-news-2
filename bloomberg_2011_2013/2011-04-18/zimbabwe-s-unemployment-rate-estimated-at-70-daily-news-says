Zimbabwe ’s unemployment rate is
estimated at about 70 percent, the  Daily News  reported, citing
 John Robertson , an independent economist in the country.  About 850,000 Zimbabweans have paid jobs in the formal
economy, the same as in 1970, while the size of the population
has more than doubled since then, the Harare-based newspaper
cited Robertson as saying. About a third of all employed people
work for the government, the Daily News said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
