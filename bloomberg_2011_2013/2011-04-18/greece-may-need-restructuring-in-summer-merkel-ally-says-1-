Greece  may not be able to avoid
restructuring its debt before summer’s end, said  Otto Fricke ,
the parliamentary budget spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Free Democratic Party coalition partner.  “The big question is: will Greece make it through summer
without buckling and having to find some means of restructuring
its debt,” Fricke said today by phone. “The signs aren’t good
though I defy any easy predictions.”  Greek two- and 10-year government bonds slumped today,
driving yields to the highest since before the introduction of
the euro, amid concern the nation won’t be able to avoid
defaulting on its debt.  European Central Bank Council member George Provopoulos
said today that a restructuring of Greece’s debt is neither
necessary nor desirable, echoing Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou , who said on April 16 that “the pain and the
cost” of restructuring the nation’s debt would be greater than
repaying lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
