The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index fell 1.2 percent to 13,938.08, while the
Colcap Index dropped 1 percent to 1,653.76. The two indices hit
their lowest levels in a month as Standard & Poor’s put a
“negative” outlook on the AAA credit rating of the U.S.,
citing a “material risk” the nation’s leaders will fail to
deal with rising budget deficits and debt. The U.S. is
Colombia’s biggest trading partner.  Coltejer SA (COLTEJ)  , the Medellin-based clothing maker
and exporter, rose 1.2 percent to 87 centavos as the government
of President Juan Manuel Santos sends a plan today to the Obama
administration for approval of a free trade accord between the
countries, said David Pelaez, analyst at brokerage Bolsa y
Renta.  Oil companies  dropped as Colombia’s success rate in the
country’s exploratory wells was 0 percent in the first quarter,
according to statistics released by Colombia’s hydrocarbon
agency. Oil fell for the first time in four days in New York
after Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest crude exporter, said the
global market has enough supplies to meet demand.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  , Colombia’s largest  oil company ,
fell 1.8 percent to 3,605 pesos, its lowest level since Sept.
27, 2010.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp (PRE)  , the Toronto-based
oil company with fields in Colombia, fell 2.2 percent to 51,360
pesos, its lowest level since April 4.  Canacol Energy Ltd (CNE)  , the Calgary-based oil company
that operates fields in South America, fell 1.9 percent to 2,360
pesos, its lowest since Oct. 4. The drop comes amid a lack of
news on the company’s plans to drill at its Takutu block in
Guyana, said Pelaez.  To contact the reporter on this story:
