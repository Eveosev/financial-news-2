Russian billionaire Alexei Mordashov bought a country home near  Finland  that was used by
the late President  Boris Yeltsin  for $10 million.  Mordashov, majority owner of steelmaker OAO Severstal,
bought the property from the Kremlin administration and plans to
make it the centerpiece of a tourist resort, the billionaireâ€™s
S-Group investment company said in a statement.  Mordashov agreed to pay 291 million rubles ($10.3 million)
for the residence, the Vedomosti newspaper reported today,
citing Kremlin adviser Viktor Khrekov.  -- Editors: Brad Cook  To contact the reporters on this story:
