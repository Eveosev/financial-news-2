Rents for capesize ships that haul
 iron ore  fell to the lowest level in six weeks on excess vessel
supply.  Hire rates dropped 2.9 percent to $6,655 today, according
to data from the  Baltic Exchange  in  London . That’s the lowest
since March 7 and the 11th straight decline. Rentals fell 36
percent in the three weeks to April 15.  “Ship supply continues to outpace demand for most asset
classes,” Jonas Advocaat Kraft, an analyst with Pareto
Securities AS in Oslo, said in a note today.  The carrying capacity of the fleet of ships to haul
commodities such as coal, iron ore and grains will expand 13
percent this year, compared with a six percent increase in
demand, according to forecasts from London-based Clarkson Plc.  Companies ordered too many ships in 2007 and 2008, when the
Baltic Dry index, a measure of commodity shipping costs,
averaged 6,730 points. The index then plunged 60 percent during
the next two years, according to the exchange. The gauge fell
0.9 percent to 1,284 points today, a 15th straight drop.  Daily rents for supramax ships, used on routes including
carrying Indian iron ore to  China , slipped 0.4 percent to
$14,729. Panamax vessels, the second-biggest tracked by the
index after capesizes, declined 1.6 percent to $11,934 and
handysizes were little changed at $11,928.  To contact the reporter on this story:
