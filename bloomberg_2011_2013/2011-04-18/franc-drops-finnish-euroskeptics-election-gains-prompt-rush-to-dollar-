The Swiss franc rallied to a more
than three-week high against the euro as speculation  Greece  will
restructure its debt and  Standard & Poor’s  signal that it may
downgrade the U.S.’s credit rating spurred demand for a refuge.  Switzerland’s currency gained versus the euro for a sixth
day as Greece said it had no plans to restructure debt even as
German officials openly discussed the possibility. Standard &
Poor’s assigned a “negative” outlook to the U.S.’s AAA credit
rating, citing rising budget deficits and debt.  “The Swiss franc is a natural beneficiary from these debt
problems because it is fiscally very sound and benefits from
safe-haven flows,” said Elsa Lignos, a currency strategist in
London at  RBC Capital Markets .  The franc appreciated as much as 1.2 percent to 1.2729 per
euro, the strongest since March 18, before trading at $1.2747 as
of 4:18 p.m. in London. Switzerland’s currency pared losses to
trade 0.2 percent weaker at 89.87 centimes, after declining to
89.91 centimes.  S&P’s lowering of its outlook on  U.S. debt  comes as policy
makers in the world’s biggest economy struggle to agree on a
strategy to reverse the nation’s fiscal deficit more than two-
years after the start of the financial crisis.  Concerns grew that efforts to resolve Europe’s debt crisis
may stall after election results in Finland showed gains for a
euro-skeptic political group.  Rumor Denied  Finland’s Justice Ministry said support for the True Finns,
whose leader Timo Soini says taxpayers shouldn’t have helped
rescue Greece or Ireland, jumped to 19 percent in elections
yesterday. A permanent bailout fund for indebted euro-area
nations requires approval from all 17 members of the bloc.  Greece may not be able to avoid restructuring its debt
before summer’s end, said  Otto Fricke , the parliamentary budget
spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Free Democratic Party
coalition partner.  “The big question is: Will Greece make it through summer
without buckling and having to find some means of restructuring
its debt?” Fricke said today by phone. “The signs aren’t good,
though I defy any easy predictions.”  “Restructuring is not an issue we’re discussing,” Finance
Minister  George Papaconstantinou  said in an April 16 interview
in Washington.  The statement was supported by European Union spokeswoman
 Chantal Hughes  who told reporters in Brussels today that
“restructuring is not an option that’s on the table.”  Norway’s krone and the Swedish krona stayed weaker against
the dollar, snapping three days of gains. Norway’s currency
depreciated 2.5 percent to 5.5049 per dollar while Sweden’s
krona declined 2.2 percent to 6.3231 to the greenback.  “It seems to be a knee-jerk reaction due to the fact that
Scandinavian currencies are traditionally seen as being more
risky,” said Karl Olsson, a quantitative foreign-exchange
strategist at SEB Merchant Banking in  Stockholm . “There are a
lot of safe-haven flows going on.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
