March 17. United Nations offsets for December lost 2.7 percent
to 12.88 euros.  U.K. gas for the six months through September next year,
the summer contract, declined 1.8 percent on ICE, its biggest
loss since April 12. Coal for next year fell 1.5 percent to
$129.25 a ton, according to broker prices compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
