U.K. stocks advanced, with the
benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  rebounding from its biggest drop since
November, as sales at  Burberry Group Plc (BRBY)  topped estimates.  Burberry rallied 6 percent as the U.K.’s largest luxury
retailer reported fiscal fourth-quarter sales that beat
analysts’ estimates and confirmed that adjusted full-year profit
will be near the top end of projections. Xstrata Plc led raw-
material companies higher as copper gained.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index advanced 26.79, or 0.5
percent, to 5,896.87 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London . The  FTSE
All-Share Index (ASX)  added 0.5 percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index
climbed 0.8 percent.  The FTSE 100 slumped the most in five months yesterday as
 Standard & Poor’s  cut its outlook for the long-term sovereign
credit rating of the U.S. and concern grew that  Greece  will
default on its debt. Still, the gauge has rebounded 5.6 percent
since reaching its 2011 low on March 16 as investors bet that
global economic growth will underpin earnings, offsetting higher
European and Asian interest rates, the March 11 earthquake in
 Japan  and increasing oil prices.  Burberry climbed 6 percent to 1,215 pence, the stock’s
highest price since its initial public offering in 2002.
Excluding  Spain , revenue in the quarter ended March 31 rose 32
percent to 390 million pounds ($636.3 million) from 295 million
pounds a year earlier, the London-based company said today in a
statement. The average of three analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg called for sales of 351.3 million pounds.  “This is a rather better profit outcome than we had
anticipated,” Katharine Wynne, a London-based analyst at
Investec Securities, wrote in a report. Wynne will probably
raise her earnings forecast for 2011, according to the report.  Marks & Spencer, SABMiller  Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  climbed 1.5 percent to 376.5
pence as Citigroup Inc. upgraded the shares to “buy” from
“hold.”  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  gained 1.4 percent to 2,220 pence as the
world’s second-largest brewer by volume reported fourth-quarter
beer sales that beat analysts’ estimates, led by growth in
Africa and  Peru .  Of the 16 companies in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, a
regional benchmark, that have reported earnings since April 11,
11 have beaten estimates for per-share profit, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. In the U.S.,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
posted a smaller-than-projected decline in earnings today.  Xstrata advanced 1.5 percent to 1,458.5 pence. Vedanta Plc
added 1.5 percent to 2,267 pence and Fresnillo Plc gained 3
percent to 1,559 pence.  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  sank 1.6 percent to 393.6 pence after reporting
full-year earnings that missed analysts’ estimates. The U.K.’s
largest retailer predicted that its domestic market will remain
“challenging” after fourth-quarter sales slid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
