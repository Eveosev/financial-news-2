China  needs to reduce its foreign-
exchange reserves as they exceed the level the nation requires
and are putting pressure on the central bank’s sterilization
operations, Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  said yesterday.  The management and diversification of the holdings, which
exceeded $3 trillion at the end of March, should be improved,
the head of the People’s Bank of China said after a speech at
 Tsinghua University  in Beijing.  Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. said it
plans to raise a net $249.4 million through the issue of
convertible preferred shares and warrants to a unit of China
Investment Corp., the nation’s sovereign wealth fund. The
proceeds will be used for  capital spending  and to repay debt.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
