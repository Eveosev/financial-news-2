Siemens AG (SIE) , Germany’s largest
engineering company, may have its  credit rating  lifted by
 Standard & Poor’s  for the first time in two years amid “solid”
operating performance and “prudent” cash use.  Standard & Poor’s raised the outlook for Siemens’s long-
term A+ rating to “positive” from “stable,” and increased
the short-term rating to A-1+ from A-1, the rating company said
today in a statement.  “Siemens’s cash flow performance in 2010 outstripped our
expectations, supported by stronger earnings and a disciplined
approach toward capital expenditures and working capital
investments,” Eric Tanguy, a credit analyst at S&P, said in
today’s statement.  The Munich-based engineering company has focused on smaller
purchases in recent years, swelling cash reserves at Siemens.
Siemens increased the free cash flow it generates from
operations compared to its debt level to 105 percent in 2010, up
from 40 percent the previous year, the rating company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
