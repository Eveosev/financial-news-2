Acciona SA (ANA) , Spain’s second-
largest wind-farm operator, agreed to sell two highway
concessions in Chile to Italy’s Atlantia SpA as part of its
plans to sell mature assets.  Acciona, based in Madrid, sold its stakes in Chilean
concessions Autopista Vespucio Sur and Red Vial Litoral
Central to Atlantia for 293 million euros ($418 million),
the Spanish company said in a statement today.  The value of the transaction, coordinated by Spain’s
 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , would amount to 446
million euros, including 153 million euros in net debt at
the end of 2010, Acciona said.  The sale is part of Acciona’s plan to divest from
mature assets. The company still considers  Chile  as a
strategic market for growth, it said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
