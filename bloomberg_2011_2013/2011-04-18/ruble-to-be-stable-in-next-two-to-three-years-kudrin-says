The Russian ruble’s exchange rate
“won’t change significantly” during the next two to three
years, Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said.  “We are planning on the stability of the ruble,” Kudrin
said in  Washington  in remarks broadcast by state-owned  Russia 
Today television. “There is some strengthening now, because the
oil price is very high.”  Oil may hold near current levels for a year or 18 months,
Kudrin said. Russian corporate and sovereign debt will remain in
good demand as long as Russia meets its strict macroeconomic
parameters, Kudrin said. Russia’s debt is at 11 percent of gross
domestic product, he said.  The country invests its windfall oil revenue in U.S.,
European, Japanese and British debt after excluding Greek and
Irish debt from the list, he said.  Urals crude, Russia’s benchmark export blend, climbed above
$100 a barrel in February as unrest in North Africa and the
Middle East disrupted some oil flows. Urals for delivery to
northwest  Europe  declined 2.7 percent last week to $119.61 a
barrel on April 15, after touching $122.88 on April 8, the
highest since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
