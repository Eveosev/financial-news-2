Japanese voters are critical of
Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s handling of the crisis at a crippled
nuclear plant and support raising taxes to finance rebuilding
plans after last month’s earthquake and tsunami, surveys show.  The Nikkei newspaper said today that 70 percent disapprove
of the government’s response to the disaster at the Fukushima
Dai-Ichi power plant, while the Asahi newspaper put the number
at 67 percent and the Mainichi daily at 68 percent. Between 58
percent and 69 percent of the public favor higher taxes to help
pay for reconstruction, according to the three polls.  The surveys come a week after Kan’s  Democratic Party of
Japan  suffered a setback in local elections, the first since the
March 11 earthquake and tsunami. The head of the opposition
 Liberal Democratic Party ,  Sadakazu Tanigaki , said April 14 Kan
should consider stepping down, something the prime minister has
so far indicated he has no intention of doing.  “In addition to achieving a recovery from the disaster, I
want to pave the way for fiscal reconstruction as I stated
initially,” Kan said today in parliament, responding to an LDP
lawmaker who urged him to resign. “If I can do this I will be
able to meet my political ambition.”  Rebuilding Plan  Kan plans to unveil his initial spending package this month
to rebuild northeastern  Japan  after the region sustained damages
that the government estimates may be as much as 25 trillion yen
($301 billion). Kan’s approval rating was 21 percent in the
Asahi, almost unchanged from last month. It rose three points to
22 percent in the Mainichi and five points to 27 percent in the
Nikkei.  At the same time, the Nikkei poll showed less than a fifth
of voters said Kan should step down soon. The Mainichi and
Nikkei papers said around 60 percent of voters favored bringing
the LDP into the government, something party has resisted. The
Asahi poll showed 43 percent in favor and 37 percent opposed to
a DPJ-LDP coalition.  The Nikkei poll, carried out with TV  Tokyo  Corp., surveyed
983 voters, while the Asahi canvassed 1,999 people and the
Mainichi 931. None of the papers provided a margin of error.  The surveys were taken between April 15 and 17, and didn’t
address Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s plan, announced yesterday, to
end the crisis at the Dai-Ichi facility within the next six to
nine months. The utility, known as Tepco, said it expects a
sustained drop in radiation within the next three months.  New Bonds  The first rebuilding package may be as much as 4 trillion
yen and the government has said it aims to avoid issuing
deficit-covering bonds to pay for it as the country grapples
with the world’s largest public debt. The DPJ wants to issue
reconstruction bonds for a second extra budget during the 2011
fiscal year,  Kyodo News  cited the party’s Secretary General,
Katsuya Okada, as saying today.  Japan’s  Finance Ministry  said today it will override a law
that automatically lowers gasoline prices when costs surge, as
the government secures funds to rebuild from the nation’s record
earthquake.  Finance chief Yoshihiko Noda agreed with members of his tax
panel this morning to “temporarily freeze” the measure, which
cuts levies if gasoline exceeds 160 yen per liter for three
straight months, Vice Finance Minister Fumihiko Igarashi told
reporters in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
