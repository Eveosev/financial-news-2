India , the worldâ€™s second-largest
wheat producer, increased the minimum price at which the
government buys grain from farmers by 4.5 percent, Food Minister
K.V. Thomas said.  The government will pay 1,170 rupees ($26.39) per 100
kilograms (220 pounds) of wheat, compared with 1,120 rupees
previously, he told reporters in  New Delhi  today.  The federal government is the biggest buyer of food crops,
purchasing them at guaranteed prices from farmers and selling
them to people on low incomes at subsidized rates through state-
run shops. The guaranteed prices are intended to protect farmers
from forced sales at low rates on the open market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
