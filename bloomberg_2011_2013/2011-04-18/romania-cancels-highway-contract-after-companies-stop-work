Romania canceled a contract with
four local companies for the construction of 43 kilometers of
highway, the Transport Ministryâ€™s road department said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The ministry ended the contract with Spedition UMB SRL,
Pa&Co International SRL, Euroconstruct Trading 98 SRL and
Tehnostrade SRL, for building a highway between Bucharest and
the southern city of Ploiesti, after the companies failed to
carry out any work on the road for 16 months, according to the
statement.  The ministry plans to revise the project and prepare a new
tender for selecting a constructor in the next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
