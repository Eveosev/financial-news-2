Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s
largest retailer, said Chief Executive Officer Michael Duke
received compensation valued at $18.7 million last year, less
than a year earlier, as U.S. store sales dropped.  Duke, 61, received incentive pay, which is tied to Wal-
Mart’s financial performance, of $3.85 million in the year ended
Jan. 31, down from $4.8 million a year earlier, according to a
securities filing today. His salary rose 2.4 percent to $1.23
million, based on U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules.
A year earlier, Duke’s compensation totaled $19.2 million.  Sales by Wal-Mart’s U.S. stores open for at least 12 months
have fallen for seven straight quarters, spurring Duke to
overhaul his U.S. management team since last year and return
thousands of items to shelves. Unemployment and rising gas
prices have some consumers tightening budgets in the U.S. where
the company’s Wal-Mart stores generate almost two-thirds of
revenue.  “We were simply not satisfied with the net sales results
in Walmart U.S. last year,” Duke said in the company’s 2011
annual shareholders  report . The retailer will hold its annual
meeting June 3 in Fayetteville,  Arkansas .  Stock awards for Duke, CEO since February 2009, declined
slightly to $12.65 million last year. Duke’s perks, including
the use of company aircraft and a home security system, totaled
$477,000 last year, up 50 percent.  Wal-Mart also agreed today to buy closely held social media
company Kosmix Corp. for an undisclosed sum to expand its online
operations. The  Mountain View , California-based company, founded
in 2004, will be part of the retail giant’s newly formed
@WalmartLabs unit, which will explore how consumers shop using
social media and mobile phones, the company said in a statement.  Wal-Mart, based in  Bentonville , Arkansas, fell 24 cents to
$53.31 at 4:00 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have slipped 1.1 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
