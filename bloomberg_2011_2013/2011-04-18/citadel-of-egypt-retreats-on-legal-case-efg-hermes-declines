Citadel Capital SAE, an Egyptian
private equity firm, declined to a record low on concern a legal
case against it will dent investor confidence in financial
stocks. EFG-Hermes Holding SAE, the country’s biggest investment
bank, also retreated.  Citadel tumbled 8.3 percent to 4.3 Egyptian pounds, the
lowest since listing shares in December 2009, as of 2:06 p.m. in
Cairo, taking the loss since April 14 to 18 percent. That gives
the company a market value of 2.81 billion pounds ($472
million.) EFG-Hermes slumped 8.1 percent to 18.01 pounds.  A claim filed with the public prosecutor alleged that
Citadel bought a cement maker from the government at a low
price, Adel El Saeed, a spokesman for the public prosecutor,
said April 14. Citadel said it bought Helwan Portland Cement
from private owners, not the government.  “There’s a lot of confusion about corruption claims filed
against prominent businessmen and uncertainty about how they
will be resolved,” said Tamer Nigm, head of sales and trading
at Cairo-based Watheeqa Securities Brokerage. “That’s affecting
the entire market, including stocks like Citadel and EFG-Hermes,
in addition to the real estate sector.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
