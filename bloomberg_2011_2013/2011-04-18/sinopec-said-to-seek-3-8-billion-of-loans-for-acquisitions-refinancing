China Petrochemical Corp., known as
Sinopec Group, is seeking $3.8 billion of five-year term loans
from lenders, according to two people familiar with the matter.  The loans are being offered to banks with interest and fee
payments, the so-called top level all-in pricing, of 127 basis
points more than the London interbank offered rate, one of the
people said, asking not to be identified because the details are
private.  Proceeds will be used for overseas acquisitions and to
refinance debt associated with the groupâ€™s stake purchase in
Syncrude Canada Ltd. last year, that person said.  The Beijing-based company earlier hired  Australia  and New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.,
Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd.
and United Overseas Bank Ltd. to help arrange the loan, the
other person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
