Chi-X  Europe  Ltd.’s chief financial
officer, Kevin O’Keefe, will leave the company in the second
senior departure as  Bats Global Markets  completes the purchase
of Europe’s largest alternative stock trading system.  O’Keefe, who was head of international strategy at Instinet
when London-based Chi-X was being planned in 2005, became its
first chief financial officer. He’ll leave the company after a
transition period following the close of the takeover, the
company said in an e-mailed statement today. Chief executive
officer Alasdair Haynes is also departing after the merger.  Bats agreed to buy Chi-X Europe Ltd. in February. Mark Hemsley, who heads Bats’ European unit, will lead the combined
organization. He has said the new entity, to be named Bats Chi-X
Europe, may convert into a registered exchange and seek to list
companies in the region.  Bats, the fourth-largest operator of U.S. equity markets
and Europe’s second-biggest alternative trading platform, will
pay $300 million for Chi-X Europe plus an additional $65 million
if earnings beat targets, two people familiar with the matter
have said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
