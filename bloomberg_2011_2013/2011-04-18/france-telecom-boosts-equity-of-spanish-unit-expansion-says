France Telecom SA (FTE)  swapped 4 billion
euros ($5.7 billion) of loans it had provided to its Spanish
mobile unit into equity,  Expansion  reported, without saying how
it got the information.  The transaction will allow the unit, which operates under
the Orange brand, to cut debt by 87 percent to 600 million
euros, the Madrid-based newspaper said. Officials at the company
declined to comment, Expansion said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
