U.S. stocks may drop as the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gathers downward momentum, pulling
the gauge down 3.4 percent to the next support level of about
1,275, according to Credit Suisse Group AG.  The moving average convergence/divergence, or MACD,
indicator -- a measure used to identify changes to stocks’
momentum or direction -- has fallen since April 7 when the  S&P
500  reached 1,333.51. The gauge retreated 1 percent through the
end of last week.  “Bearish medium-term momentum forces us to remain wary of
an eventual break lower,” David Sneddon, the London-based head
of technical analysis at Credit Suisse wrote in a report to
investors today.  Even so, the S&P 500 has risen 4.9 percent in 2011. While
total income for the index has topped the average analyst
estimate for eight straight quarters, the proportion of
companies beating forecasts has fallen for three consecutive
periods, the longest streak since 2000, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Of the 11 companies that reported last
week, profit trailed the average analyst estimate by 3.5
percent, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
