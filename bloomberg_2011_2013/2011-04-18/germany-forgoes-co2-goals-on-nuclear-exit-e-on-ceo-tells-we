Germany  won’t reach its climate
change protection goals in the coming 10 years if it exits
nuclear power earlier than planned, said Johannes Teyssen, chief
executive officer of  E.ON AG (EOAN) , according to Die Welt.  The country’s carbon dioxide output will rise as utilities
build natural-gas- and coal-fired power plants to replace
reactors, the German newspaper cited the CEO of the Dusseldorf-
based energy company as saying in an interview.  The German government, which plans to cut greenhouse gas
emissions 40 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels, wants to
accelerate the country’s exit from nuclear power after
explosions at Japanese reactors stoked safety concerns.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
