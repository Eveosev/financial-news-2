Hong Kong stocks fell for a third
day, as Chinese developers dropped after the government raised
banks’ reserve requirements to tame inflation.  China Resources Land Ltd. (1109) , a state-controlled developer,
fell 3 percent and  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. (688) ,
controlled by the construction ministry, lost 2.1 percent.
Ajisen ( China ) Holdings Ltd., an operator of Japanese-style
casual restaurants, tumbled 11 percent after its chairman sold
shares in the company.  AIA Group Ltd. (1299) , the third-largest Asian-
based insurer by market value, gained 2.6 percent after its new-
business value gained.  The Hang Seng Index fell 0.7 percent to 23,830.31 at the
close, after rising as much as 0.6 percent. About four stocks
dropped for every one that gained on the 45-member Hang Seng
Index. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese
companies’ H-shares declined 0.9 percent to 13,410.90.  “Concern is still lingering on further tightening in
China,” said  Ben Kwong , chief operating officer at KGI Asia Ltd.
“Investors are worried there will be further measures to
regulate the overheating of the  property market .”  China Resources Land dropped 3 percent to HK$14.16, and
China Overseas Land fell 2.1 percent to HK$16.14.  Shimao
Property Holdings Ltd. (813) , which gets all its revenue from China,
declined 1.6 percent to HK$11.40. A measure of property stocks
had the biggest drop among the Hang Seng Index’s four industry
groups.  Ratio Increase  China increased banks’ reserve requirements to lock up cash
and cool inflation, and central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan
said monetary tightening will continue for “some time.”  Reserve ratios will rise a half percentage point from April
21, the People’s Bank of China said on its website yesterday,
pushing the requirement to a record 20.5 percent for the biggest
lenders. The move came less than two weeks after an interest-
rate increase. Zhou said April 16 he sees no “absolute” limit
on how high reserve requirements can go.  Ajisen tumbled 11 percent to HK$15.16 after its chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Poon Wai placed 63.6 million shares
held through wholly owned Favor Choice Group Ltd.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 1.6 percent last week as China’s
strong economic data fueled concerns the government may take
more steps to tame inflation. Shares in the gauge traded at an
average 12.7 times forecast earnings on April 15, compared with
14.4 times at the end of last year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  AIA New Policies  Among stocks that rose, AIA surged to a record, gaining 2.6
percent to HK$25.70, the biggest positive contributor to the
Hang Seng Composite Index. The company said its value of new
business rose 21 percent in the first quarter as it sold more-
profitable policies.  Siberian Mining Group Co., a coal producer, surged 7.5
percent to 17.3 Hong Kong cents after saying it plans to buy a
70 percent stake in Trenaco SA for $15 million.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index dropped 0.8 percent to
23,779. The HSI Volatility Index, the benchmark gauge for Hong
Kong stock options, rose 0.6 percent to 18.11, indicating
options traders expect a swing of 5.2 percent in the Hang Seng
Index in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
