Maronda Homes Inc., a residential
developer based in western  Pennsylvania , filed for bankruptcy,
saying it owes creditors as much as $100 million.  The company, citing its inability to renegotiate credit
terms, filed a Chapter 11 petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania today, listing assets worth as much as
$500 million. Chapter 11 is used by companies that plan to
reorganize, reducing their debt and exit bankruptcy.  Maronda, based in Clinton, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh,
builds homes in  Florida , Pennsylvania,  Georgia  and Kentucky,
according to the company’s website. The family-owned business
has been building homes since 1972, court papers show.  “Given the situation with the lenders, the resulting
liquidity, absence of credit availability and threatened
foreclosure of its assets would inevitably to Maronda’s
inability to pay its debts as they become due,” Maronda said in
court papers. “Thus debtors were left with no option except to
commence these bankruptcy proceedings.”  The builder said 13 of the 14 pre-bankruptcy lenders
indicated they would agree to changes to the amended credit
agreement dated March 8, 2010, provided the 14th bank agreed as
well. Maronda failed to obtain the approval of Huntington Bank.  The case is In Re Maronda Homes Inc., 11-22418,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Western District of Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh).  To contact the reporters on this story:
