Principal Financial Group Inc. (PFG) , the
 Des Moines , Iowa-based life insurer and asset manager, agreed to
buy a 51 percent stake in hedge fund Finisterre Capital LLP for
as much as $115 million.  Principal will make an initial payment of $84.6 million and
may pay as much as $30 million in 2013, depending on
performance, the company said today in a regulatory filing.
London-based Finisterre manages about $1.6 billion and invests
in emerging markets, according to a separate statement.  The Finisterre purchase adds to Principal’s investments in
developing economies, following last week’s agreement to buy the
Mexican pension business of HSBC Holdings Plc for $198 million.
Buying the Finisterre stake may boost Principal’s earnings by
2012, excluding transaction and integration costs, the insurer
said in the statement.  Finisterre invests in the Middle East,  Asia  and eastern
 Europe . Its $1 billion Global Opportunity fund gained 10.6
percent last year, and has fallen 3 percent in the first three
months of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
firm’s $345 million Sovereign Debt Master fund rose 12 percent
in 2010 and has climbed 1.4 percent in the first quarter.  Finisterre’s five partners, including Chief Investment
Officer Paul Crean, will continue to make all investment
decisions, according to the statement.  New Fund Planned  Selling a majority stake to Principal “clearly lowers the
business risk from a counterparties’ point of view,” Crean said
in an interview. Finisterre should also benefit from Principal’s
connections in Asia, the Middle East,  Australia  and  Japan  to
attract more investors, he said.  Finisterre plans to start a new equity fund in the final
three months of this year or the first quarter of 2012, Crean
said. The partnership with Principal means the insurer may
provide start-up capital for the fund, he said.  Principal’s shares were down 2.5 percent to $30.62 cents in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading at 10:50 a.m., giving
the company a market value of $9.8 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
