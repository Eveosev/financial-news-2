China  and New Zealand signed a
currency swap agreement worth 25 billion yuan ($3.8 billion)
today, according to a statement posted on the People’s Bank of
China’s website.  The agreement will last three years and is open to
extension, the  statement  said. The aim is to help boost
bilateral trade and investment as well as strengthen financial
cooperation, the PBOC said.  China is seeking to promote greater use of the yuan in
global trade and finance to reduce reliance on the  U.S. dollar ,
which has weakened against all 16 major currencies since 2008.
Before today, China’s central bank had signed a total of 803.5
billion yuan of currency swaps with counterparts in South Korea,
 Hong Kong , Malaysia, Belarus, Indonesia, Argentina, Iceland and
Singapore since December 2008.  --Judy Chen, Huiwen Yang, Alfred Cang. Editor: James Regan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Judy Chen in
