Jose Eduardo  dos Santos , the
president of  Angola , said speculation on the Internet about his
wealth is designed to turn Angolans against the government and
replace him with a “stooge” of foreign powers.  “Someone is circulating news on the Internet that the
Angolan president has a fortune of $20 billion overseas,” Dos
Santos said in a copy of a speech made to the country’s
Politburo and published by Agencia AngolaPress. The reports are
“disinformation and manipulation,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
