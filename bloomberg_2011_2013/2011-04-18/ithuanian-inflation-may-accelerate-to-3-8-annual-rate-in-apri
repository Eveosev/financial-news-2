Lithuanian inflation, calculated
according to European Union standards, will probably accelerate
in April to an annual 3.8 percent because of rising food and
clothing costs, the  statistics office  said.  Consumer prices will probably rise 0.5 percent from the
previous month after a 1 percent increase in March, the Vilnius-
based office said in an e-mailed statement today. The inflation
rate in March was 3.7 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
