Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) , whose top-selling
antipsychotic drug Zyprexa faces generic competition in October,
said first-quarter profit fell 15 percent on costs from a
diabetes agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH.  Net income decreased to $1.06 billion, or 95 cents a share,
from $1.25 billion, or $1.13, a year earlier, the Indianapolis-
based drugmaker said today in a statement. Earnings excluding
one-time items were $1.24 a share, beating the $1.17 average
estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company
reiterated its forecast for full-year adjusted earnings.  Lilly has exceeded analysts’ estimates in 21 of the past 25
quarters, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors are
more focused on whether Chief Executive Officer John Lechleiter’s strategy of spurning large-scale acquisitions in
favor of smaller deals and partnerships will pay off, said Les Funtleyder, a health fund manager at Miller Tabak & Co.  “They’ve done a pretty good job of beating expectations,”
Funtleyder said in a telephone interview from  New York . “We are
heading toward the Zyprexa expiration. At some point, we need a
little bit more clarity about how they’re going to grapple with
that.”  Lilly fell 39 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $35.62 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
fallen 2.5 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 5.7
percent average gain among 52 stocks in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Health-Care Index.  Revenue Increases  Revenue in the quarter rose 6.4 percent to $5.84 billion,
$160 million ahead of analysts’ estimates on higher demand
overseas. The antidepressant Cymbalta increased 13 percent to
$908.8 million, including a 43 percent gain outside the U.S.
after it was introduced in  Japan  and other markets, Lilly said.
Zyprexa sales rose 5.5 percent to $1.28 billion. Alimta, a lung
cancer treatment, gained 10 percent to $579.9 million.  The drugmaker needs new products to replace top-selling
Zyprexa. Lilly is also developing medicines for cancer,
arthritis and Alzheimer’s disease, all of which “have a fair
amount of risk associated with them” in terms of the likelihood
of commercial success, said  Tony Butler , an analyst at  Barclays
Capital  in New York, in a telephone interview last week.  Lilly agreed to pay $388 million in the quarter to closely
held Boehringer, of Ingelheim,  Germany , to help develop two of
the company’s diabetes drugs. The agreement also includes two
insulin products developed by Lilly, which may receive $650
million in payments if the medicines are successful in testing.  The quarter also included $76.3 million in cost tied to
previously announced job cuts. While Lilly reaffirmed its Jan.
27 forecast of full-year earnings excluding one-time items of
$4.15 to $4.30 a share, the company said net income in 2011 will
be 6 cents less per share than previously forecast because of
the severance costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
