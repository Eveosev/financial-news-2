The European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund  oppose extending the deadline for
 Portugal  to reduce its  budget deficit  after that country
requested financial assistance, Diario Economico reported,
without saying how it obtained the information.  The  Portuguese government  will try to “soften” the
austerity measures that will be imposed, the Portuguese
newspaper said. The government has announced budget deficit
targets of 4.6 percent of gross domestic product for this year
and 3 percent next year.  IMF officials joined European Commission and European
Central Bank teams on April 12 “for technical discussions with
the government” and policy discussions are starting today, the
IMF said last week.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
