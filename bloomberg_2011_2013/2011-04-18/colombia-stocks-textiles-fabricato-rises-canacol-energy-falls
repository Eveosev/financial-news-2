The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 11:34 a.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index fell 1.2 percent to 13,929.74, while the
Colcap Index dropped 1 percent to 1,653.10.  Textiles makers rose as the government of President  Juan Manuel Santos  sends a plan today to the Obama administration for
approval of a free trade accord between the countries, said
Santiago Melo, an analyst at Alianza Valores SA.  Textiles Fabricato Tejicondor SA (FABRI)  , Colombia’s
biggest textile maker, rose 1.8 percent to 44.3 pesos.  Canacol Energy Ltd (CNE)  , the Calgary-based  oil company 
that operates fields in  South America , dropped 2.3 percent to
2,350 pesos, its lowest since Oct. 5. The drop comes amid a lack
of news on the company’s plans to drill at its Takutu block in
Guyana, Melo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
