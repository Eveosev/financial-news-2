Premiums for sweet crudes in the
U.S. Gulf compared to West  Texas  Intermediate strengthened as
Brent oil’s spread against the U.S. benchmark widened.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart for June
delivery increased 47 cents to $13.70 a barrel at 12:47 p.m. in
 New York . The differential for the contract nearest to
expiration reached a record $15.94 on Feb. 16.  When Brent gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European grade.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 60 cents to
$18 a barrel at 12:12 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained 55
cents to $18.50 over the benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend weakened 5 cents to $10.45 a barrel over WTI. Thunder
Horse’s premium lost $1.35 to $13.75 a barrel over WTI.
Poseidon’s premium strengthened 10 cents to $11.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium was unchanged at $9.75 a
barrel.  West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 5 cents to $3.35 a
barrel. It has tracked more closely to its historical average
discount versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas,
away from the  Gulf Coast  and close to Cushing,  Oklahoma , the
delivery point for oil traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $12.60 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$15.60 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
