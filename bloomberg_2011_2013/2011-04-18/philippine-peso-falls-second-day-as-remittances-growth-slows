Philippine three-year bonds gained
for a third day, pushing their yield to a three-month low, after
the government reported better-than-projected  tax revenue  and
sold more bills than planned at an auction today. The peso was
little changed.  The  Bureau of Internal Revenue , which makes up more than 60
percent of state earnings, collected 199.55 billion pesos ($4.6
billion) in the first quarter, exceeding a target of 197.04
billion pesos, the agency said in a statement on April 16.
Yields on Treasury bills due in three months to a year fell to
record lows at a sale today, prompting the government to offer
more debt.  “There’s a lot of liquidity and we saw it in the strong
demand for the bills,” said Speedy Delfino, a fixed-income
trader at Bank of Commerce in Manila. “Improving tax
collections also indicate better fiscal numbers,” he said.  The yield on the 6.25 percent bond due January 2014 fell
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 4.595 percent as
of 4:48 p.m. in  Manila , the lowest since Jan. 17, according to
Tradition Financial Services.  Demand for Treasury bills in today’s auction reached almost
31 billion pesos and the government sold 9.6 billion pesos of
the notes, more than 9 billion pesos originally offered. The
Bureau of the Treasury will offer as much as 9 billion pesos
more of the bills tomorrow, Deputy Treasurer Eduardo Mendiola
said today.  Inflation is likely to slow later this year and
expectations of interest-rate increases may be excessive, Dow
Jones reported, citing an interview with Finance Secretary Cesar
Purisima.  The peso closed at 43.235 per dollar in Manila, little
changed from 43.24 on April 15, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.
It fell as much as 0.3 percent earlier today.  To contact the reporter for this story:
