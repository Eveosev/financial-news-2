OAO Polymetal declined in Moscow
trading after Kommersant reported the Russian silver and gold
producer may miss its gold output target this year.  The company may fall short of its 2011 target of 1 million
ounces of gold by as much as 10 percent, the newspaper reported,
citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter. The
shares lost 3.6 percent to 577.7 rubles at the 6:45 p.m. close
in Moscow, the biggest fall since Dec. 10.  Polymetal may be forced to delay the start of its
processing plant in the Amur region for “technical reasons,”
the Moscow-based newspaper said. Polymetal Vice President Pavel Danilin declined to comment on the report when Bloomberg called
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
