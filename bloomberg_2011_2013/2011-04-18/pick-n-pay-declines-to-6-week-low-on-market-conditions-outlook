Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. (PIK) ,  South
Africa â€™s second-biggest retailer, dropped to the lowest intraday
level in six weeks after saying it expects at least the next six
months to continue to be tough.  The stock slipped as much as 1.50 rand, or 3.4 percent, to
42.70 rand, the lowest since Feb. 8, and traded down 2.9 percent
at 42.90 rand as of 10:34 a.m. Shares of Pick n Pay Holdings
Ltd., the company that controls Pick n Pay Stores, lost 2.7
percent to 18 rand.  Pick n Pay Stores expects the difficult trading conditions
that contributed to a decrease in fiscal 2011 profit to continue
during financial 2012, Chief Executive Officer Nick Badminton
said in a presentation today. He spoke after the company
reported full-year profit slid 34 percent to 784.9 million rand
($115 million) in the year through Feb. 28, compared with 1.19
billion rand a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
