The  Federal Reserve  may be slower
to increase  interest rates  as U.S. government debates budget
cuts to reduce the deficit, said Matt Toms, the head of U.S.
public fixed-income investments at ING Investment Management.  Standard & Poor’s  put the U.S. government on notice that it
risks losing its AAA credit rating unless policy makers agree on
a plan by 2013 to reduce budget deficits and the national debt.
Toms helps manage more than $500 billion at Atlanta-based ING.
He spoke today in a telephone interview.  On reduced U.S. spending to narrow the deficit:  “The government is going to need to be more diligent. That
means some reduction in fiscal stimulus that’s been put through
the system and monetary policy will have to carry the day.”  “All else equal, growth expectations get tempered somewhat
because of this.”  “The weakened growth expectations, should we actually take
a more conservative fiscal path, would subdue growth and
therefore some inflationary pressures.”  “If this forces action and gets us on a more stable fiscal
footing, then the long-term growth trajectory is much, much
better.”  On the  U.S. dollar :  “The dollar is not falling out of bed on this.”  “Not seeing the dollar sell off is a sign that it’s not a
terminal illness yet. I think the dollar is looking for our
political bodies to address the problem.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
