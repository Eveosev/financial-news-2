United Refining Co.’s Warren,
 Pennsylvania , refinery is in “startup mode” this week, Chief
Executive Officer John Catsimatidis said in an e-mail.  Planned work at the 70,000-barrel-a-day plant, scheduled to
start March 28, was expected to reduce rates slightly, he said
Jan. 13.  Routine work on half of the plant was conducted late last
year and this will complete the other half, Catsimatidis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
