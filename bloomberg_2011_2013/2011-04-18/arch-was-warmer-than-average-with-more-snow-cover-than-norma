The combined land and ocean global
temperature in March was the 13th warmest on record and warmer
than the 20th-century average for the 35th consecutive year, the
 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  said.  The combined temperature was about 55.8 degrees Fahrenheit
(13.19 Celsius), above the past-century average of 54.9 degrees,
according to an NOAA statement. Last year was the warmest March
on record with a combined land-sea temperature of 56.3 degrees.  So far, 2011 is trending warmer than normal, according to
NOAA. The combined ocean-land temperature worldwide from January
through March was about 54.9 degrees, or about 0.8 degree above
normal, according to NOAA.  The average temperature across the U.S. was 44 degrees, 1.4
degrees above the 20th-century average, the statement said. The
average snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere during March was
16.28 million square miles, the agency said.  “This makes the largest March snow cover extent for the
Northern Hemisphere since 1986, and the sixth consecutive month
with above-average snow cover,” the statement said. “Both
North American and Eurasian land areas had snow cover extents
which were above average.”  At the same time, the average extent of  Arctic sea ice  was
at its second-lowest level on record last month, behind March
2006, according to NOAA. It reached its annual maximum of 5.65
million square miles on March 7, which tied 2006 for the
smallest maximum since satellites have been used to make the
measurement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
