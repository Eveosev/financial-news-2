A unit of Iasis Healthcare Corp.,
an owner and operator of community hospitals in the U.S., is
seeking $1.235 billion in new senior secured loans to refinance
existing debt.  The credit facility will include a $935 million senior
secured  term loan  and a $300 million senior secured ‘super
priority’ revolving line of credit, the Franklin, Tennessee-
based company said today in a statement released by  Business
Wire . Super priority debt holders have a higher claim on a
borrowers’ assets in a bankruptcy.  Iasis also plans to sell up to $935 million in senior
unsecured notes due 2019, according to the statement.  Proceeds will also be used to fund a cash tender offer to
repurchase its outstanding 8.75 percent senior subordinated
notes, repay paid-in-kind loans for its parent company, fund
acquisitions as well as a potential distribution to equity
holders, Iasis said in the statement.  Total debt could increase by at least $450 million, which
“indicates a dramatic spike” in debt to earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization at 6.5 times
versus 4.9 times as of December 31, according to a report by New
York-based debt research firm Gimme Credit LLC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
