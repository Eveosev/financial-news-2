Zahi Hawass ,  Egypt ’s minister of
state for antiquities, said he will appeal a one-year jail
sentence imposed on him yesterday.  The sentence is related to a lawsuit accusing him of
refusing to carry out a court ruling, the state-run Middle East
News Agency said today. The court had ordered a halt to bidding
from companies to run a bookstore in the Egyptian Museum in
Cairo, Hawass said today in his  blog .  “Tomorrow, the head of the legal affairs department at the
Ministry of Antiquities will go to the court to file our
appeal,” Hawass said in the Web log. “He will present evidence
that the bid for the bookstore contract was finished before the
original court ruling, so therefore we could not follow the
ruling to stop the bidding.”  Egyptian archeologists including Hawass appealed to the
government in March to protect the country’s tombs and
storehouses from looting following the revolution that ousted
President  Hosni Mubarak . As well as the theft of artifacts from
the Egyptian Museum, storage areas were broken into, including
one belonging to the New York  Metropolitan Museum  of Art’s
archaeological expedition in Dahshur, Hawass said on March 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
