Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  sold its non-
real estate private equity assets in Asia to NewQuest Capital
Partners, said Darren Massara, a managing partner at NewQuest.  NewQuest, backed by a group of investors including Paul
Capital Partners, HarbourVest Partners, LGT Capital Partners and
Axiom Asia, is starting a $400 million private equity fund,
Massara said in a telephone interview today. He declined to say
how much NewQuest paid Bank of America for the assets.  The fund bought more than 20 different investments, mainly
in China and India, from Bank of America, according to a
statement from NewQuest.  Rob Stewart , a Hong Kong-based
spokesman at Bank of America, declined to comment.  “The portfolio purchase was substantial, but we also have
substantial money to invest,” Masara said.  Deals between private equity firms represent about 10
percent of all such transactions in  Asia , compared with about 50
percent in Europe, according to Massara. This so-called
secondary market is “the largest untapped market,” he said.  Massara worked for Merrill Lynch & Co., the investment bank
bought by Bank of America in 2009, before joining NewQuest.
Former Merrill employees Amit Gupta, Bonnie Lo and Min Lin are
partners in NewQuest, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
