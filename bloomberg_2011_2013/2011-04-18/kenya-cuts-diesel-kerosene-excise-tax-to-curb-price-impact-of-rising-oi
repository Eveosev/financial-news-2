Kenya ’s government reduced the
excise tax on diesel and kerosene to help “cushion the impact”
of rising fuel prices, Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said.  The duty on kerosene will decline 30 percent and the tax on
diesel will fall 20 percent, Kenyatta told reporters today in
Kenya’s capital, Nairobi.  “We are reducing our revenues to help ease the problem,”
he said.  Consumer groups plan demonstrations in Nairobi tomorrow to
highlight the rising cost of living, after inflation in East
Africa’s largest economy climbed for the fifth straight month in
March to 9.19 percent compared with government’s 5 percent
target. Kenya increased the maximum retail price on regular
gasoline by 7.2 percent to 108.16 shillings a liter from April
15 because of higher global crude costs.  The turmoil in oil-producing nations is “clearly beyond
our control,” Kenyatta said.  In neighboring  Uganda , authorities arrested protesters and
fired tear gas and rubber bullets to break up a series of
protests since April 11 against rising prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
