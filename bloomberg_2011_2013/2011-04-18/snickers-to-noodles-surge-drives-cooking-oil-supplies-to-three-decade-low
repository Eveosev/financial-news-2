Gold was little changed after
reaching a record in London and New York as concern about
European debt and faster inflation boosted demand for the metal
as an alternative investment. Silver touched a 31-year high.  China  increased banks’ reserve requirements to cool
inflation that quickened in March to the fastest pace since
2008. The euro weakened against the dollar on speculation Greece
will be unable to avoid a default. Unrest in the Middle East and
North Africa and concerns about Japan’s nuclear crisis also
helped gold’s gain this year.  “Resurfacing debt concerns in the euro zone will be
bullion supportive in the short run,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an
analyst at VTB Capital in London, said in a report to clients.
“Renewed inflation concerns” are supporting prices, he said.  Immediate-delivery bullion rose as much as $1.98, or 0.1
percent, to $1,488.68 an ounce and was little changed at
$1,485.30 by 9:12 a.m. in  London . Gold for June delivery was 30
cents lower at $1,485.70 an ounce on the Comex in New York after
reaching a record $1,489.70.  The cost of insuring Greek government debt rose to a record
on April 15. “Restructuring is not an issue we’re discussing,”
Greek Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou  said in an April
16 interview in  Washington . Greece received a bailout from the
European Union and the  International Monetary Fund  last year,
and has been followed by Ireland and Portugal in seeking aid.  Reserve ratios will rise a half point from April 21, the
People’s Bank of China said on its website yesterday. The
European Central Bank this month raised  interest rates  from a
record low as inflation in the region quickened to 2.7 percent
in March, the fastest pace since October 2008.  China Tightening  The “uncertainty in the  euro zone  and inflation concerns
in Asia appear to be the main drivers” of the price, said  David Thurtell , Singapore-based head of metals research at Citigroup
Inc. “The latter was confirmed by the overnight move by the
People’s Bank of China to tighten monetary policy.”  Libyan rebels repelled an attack from forces loyal to
Muammar Qaddafi on the city of Ajdabiya, defending the front
line that runs between the country’s two biggest cities. Rebels
have struggled for weeks to take and hold cities in central
Libya. Yemen’s opposition coalition rejected a plan by six Gulf
states to end unrest in the Arabian country, saying that the
swift departure of Yemen’s President Ali Abdullah Saleh isn’t
negotiable.  Gold held in exchange-traded products rose 19.29 metric
tons to 2,069.95 tons on April 15, the highest level since
Jan. 24, data compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers show.  Silver for immediate delivery climbed as much as 0.9
percent to $43.3725 an ounce, the highest price since January
1980, the year the metal reached a record $50.35 in  New York . It
