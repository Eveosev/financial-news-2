European Central Bank Executive
Board member Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell said the ECB will
“safeguard the euro’s stability,” Gewinn magazine reported,
citing an interview.  “If clear inflation risks become apparent, we will react
and adjust interest rates according,” Tumpel-Gugerell told the
Vienna-based magazine said in a preview of an article that will
be published in Gewinn’s next issue.  Since the introduction of the euro the average inflation
rate was 2 percent, Tumpel-Gugerell was cited as saying. “I am
quite confident that we can also ensure this for the future,”
she said.     To contact the editor responsible for this story:
