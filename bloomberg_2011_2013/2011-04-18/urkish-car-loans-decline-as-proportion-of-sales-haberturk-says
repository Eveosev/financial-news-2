Turkish loans used to buy cars
declined as a proportion of total car sales, Haberturk reported
citing Onder Cider, chief executive of Arkas Otomotiv, which
sells seven brands of cars in Turkey from 23 sales points,  The proportion of cars sold with loans from banks dropped
to 37 percent in the first two weeks of April from 50 percent
previously because banks are more reluctant to lend, Cider said,
according to the Istanbul-based newspaper.  Sales of cars are also declining, though orders suggest
theyâ€™ll increase again from June, Haberturk reported Cider as
saying.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
