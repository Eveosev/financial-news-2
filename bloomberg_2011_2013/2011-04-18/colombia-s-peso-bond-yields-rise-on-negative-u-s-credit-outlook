Colombia’s peso bonds fell, pushing
yields to rise the most in a week, after  Standard & Poor’s  said
the U.S. risks losing its AAA credit rating.  S&P reduced the outlook for the long-term U.S. debt rating
to negative from stable, while affirming its current sovereign
credit ratings, saying that more than two years after the
beginning of the financial crisis, U.S. policy makers haven’t
agreed on a strategy to reverse recent fiscal deterioration or
address longer-term fiscal pressures.  “The announcement sparked  risk aversion  in global markets
and people are now seeking cash and liquid assets,” said Daniel Lozano, an analyst at Serfinco SA brokerage in Bogota.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024
rose 5 basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 8.27 percent
at 3:55 p.m. New York time, according to  Colombia ’s stock
exchange. The bond’s price fell 0.437 centavo to 113.549
centavos per peso.  The market is moving toward securities due July 2024 as the
new benchmark bond, replacing the peso securities due July 2020,
according to Lozano.  There is little trading in Colombian markets today before
the Easter holiday, he said. Colombian markets are closed April
21-22.  Colombia’s Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said in
an April 16 interview that there is no need to carry out a swap
of peso bonds, known as TES, ahead of about 10 trillion pesos
($5.6 billion) worth of debt coming due in May.  ‘Pain Threshold’  The peso was little changed at 1,799.01 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,798.43 on April 15. The currency has jumped 4.2 percent
in the past month, the second-best performance after the
Brazilian real among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  Echeverry also said he would prefer to avoid controls on
capital inflows as a measure to ease gains in the peso.  “We don’t close any doors because, as I said before, if
you reach your pain threshold, you react,” said Echeverry.
“But so far, we have been below our pain threshold.”  In a bid to ease the local currency’s rally, the government
last year eliminated most tax exemptions on foreign borrowing
and said it would delay repatriating $1.5 billion held overseas,
most of it dividends from Ecopetrol, “at least for the first
months of 2011.” Echeverry has said the government will bring
the money in “slowly” in 2011.  The central bank in February also extended a plan to buy a
minimum of $20 million daily in the local market until “at
least” June 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
