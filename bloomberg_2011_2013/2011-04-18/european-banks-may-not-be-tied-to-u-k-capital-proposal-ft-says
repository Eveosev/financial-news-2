European banks may not be subject
to the higher capital rules proposed by the U.K.’s Independent
Commission on Banking, meaning they could enjoy a competitive
advantage over domestic banks in the U.K., which “is a big
worry,” the Financial Times reported, citing a person close to
the Commission.  The “loophole” arises from the European Union’s so-called
passporting rules which allow banks to open branches in other
markets and be regulated by their home jurisdictions rather than
as subsidiaries subject to U.K. rules, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
