Asian currencies fell, snapping a
three-day rally, as concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen
bolstered demand for dollars.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index dropped 0.1
percent on speculation Finland won’t support Europe’s bailout of
Portugal and other debt-ridden economies after elections held at
the weekend. People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said
on April 16 that monetary tightening will continue for “some
time” before the central bank announced the following day that
it was increasing banks’ reserve requirements from April 21.  “There’s a bit of concern whether the Portugal bailout
will be agreed,” said  Thomas Harr , head of Asian foreign-
exchange strategy at Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore.
“China’s decision is positive for Asian currencies. It raises
expectations that  China  will move a bit faster on its
currency.”  Indonesia’s rupiah declined 0.1 percent to 8,674 per dollar
as of 3:28 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.1 percent to NT$29.089 and
India’s rupee was at 44.350 compared with 44.333 late last week.
China’s yuan strengthened 0.06 percent to 6.5287 and the Dollar
Index, a gauge of the greenback’s strength, rose 0.4 percent.  The True Finns, whose leader Timo Soini says taxpayers in
the Scandinavian country shouldn’t have helped bail out Greece
or Ireland, received 19 percent of the vote, according to the
country’s Justice Ministry. The party is poised to form a
government with the pro-Europe National Coalition after voters
used yesterday’s election to protest against bailouts.  Inflation Still Alive  Taiwan ’s dollar fell for a second day as investors sought
safer assets on speculation Greece will default on its debt.  “The Europe debt crisis weighed on the Taiwan dollar,”
said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader at Taiwan
Shin Kong Commercial Bank. “The  U.S. dollar  will probably stay
strong for the rest of the week.”  Malaysia’s ringgit traded near a 13-year high on
speculation policy makers will raise  interest rates  or tolerate
a stronger currency to tackle inflation.  A government report on April 20 will show consumer prices
rose 3.1 percent in March, the most since April 2009, according
to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Inflation accelerated more than economists expected in  India  and
China in March as oil prices jumped 19 percent this year.  “The inflation issue is still very much alive,” said D.
Sivadass, a currency-forwards trader at EON Capital Bhd. in
 Kuala Lumpur . “The authorities have got a few options via rates,
the ringgit or other forms of tightening. We still see a lot of
foreign interest betting on a stronger ringgit.”  Ringgit, Won  The ringgit was little changed at 3.0225 per dollar. It
reached 3.0165 on April 11 and April 8, the strongest level
since October 1997. The currency may strengthen to 3.0180 this
week, Sivadass said.  Elsewhere, South Korea’s won rose 0.1 percent to 1,088.40
per dollar and the  Singapore  dollar was little changed at
S$1.2451. Thailand’s baht advanced 0.1 percent to 30.11 from
April 12, the last day it traded. Thai financial markets were
closed for public holidays on April 13, 14 and 15.  To contact the reporters on this story:
