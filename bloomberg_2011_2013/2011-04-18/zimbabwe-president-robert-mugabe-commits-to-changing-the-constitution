Zimbabwean President  Robert Mugabe 
called for an end to political violence and committed himself to
constitutional reforms before fresh elections.  “We are one,” Mugabe said in a speech in the capital,
Harare, to mark Zimbabwe’s independence from Britain in 1980.
“We may have our differences but we belong to one family.
Please, no violence, no fighting.”  While the power-sharing government between Mugabe’s
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front party and
Tsvangirai’s Movement for Democratic Change has often come close
to breaking down, it helped lift the southern African nation’s
economy out of a decade of recession.  The coalition government brought political and economic
stability to the country, he said. Tsvangirai and officials from
his party also attended the Independence Day rally.  Southern African Development Community leaders on April 1
demanded an end to renewed fighting between the parties and
called for lawmakers to complete a new constitution and prepare
for elections. The MDC accuses Zanu-PF of preventing it from
holding rallies.  The U.S. and  Europe  Union weren’t prepared to discuss
lifting of sanctions, Mugabe said.  “We have had disappointing results so far in our efforts
to re-engage the Americans and the European Union over
sanctions,” he said. “When will Europe ever realize that there
is international law which forbids us from interfering in the
domestic affairs of others?”  The U.S. and EU impose targeted sanctions against Mugabe
and his political allies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
