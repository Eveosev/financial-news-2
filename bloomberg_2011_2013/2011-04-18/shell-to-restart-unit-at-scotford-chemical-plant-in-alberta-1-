Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  is restarting
a unit at its Scotford chemical plant in Alberta, according to
Randy Provencal, a company spokesman.  Production wasnâ€™t affected, said Provencal, who is based in
Calgary, Alberta. Shell does not disclose the specific unit
involved, the reason for the unit restart or the duration of the
work, he said in an e-mail today.  The plant was expected to flare gases for four to six
hours, according to a message left on a community hot line
today.  Outages can increase prices for refined products as
companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil as less feedstock is used.  The chemical plant, which is integrated with the adjoining
refinery, is 25 miles (40 kilometers) northeast of  Edmonton ,
 Alberta .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
