Canadian natural gas prices for May
delivery fell amid forecasts of milder weather in the U.S. and
above-normal supplies of hydroelectric power in western states.  Demand for heat will average 2 percent below normal across
the U.S. for the next week, according to Belton, Missouri-based
Weather Derivatives. Snow levels in the West, an indicator of
hydro power potential, are about 33 percent above normal,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There was much larger than seasonally normal hydro
generation” last week, said  Stephen Smith , an energy analyst
and president of Stephen Smith Energy Associates in Natchez,
Mississippi.  Alberta gas for May delivery fell 3.75 cents to C$3.38 per
gigajoule ($3.31 per million British thermal units) as of 2:30
p.m.  New York  time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange goes to users in  Canada  and
the U.S. and is priced on TransCanada’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  was down 6.9 cents to $4.135 per million Btu as of 2:44
p.m.  Canadian gas for prompt delivery at U.S. hubs rose as a
cold weather system lingered over the North, boosting short-term
demand. Heating demand in  Chicago  will peak at 77 percent above
normal tomorrow and gradually diminish to below-normal by April
25, Weather Derivatives said.  Delivery Point Prices  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
jumped 22.7 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $4.4643 per million Btu on
the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that
can carry about 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from
western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas gained 9.35 cents to $4.0994, according to ICE. At
Malin, Oregon, where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas was up 7.66 cents to $4.1827.  Volume on  TransCanada Corp.’s   Alberta  system, which
collects the output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.4
billion cubic feet as of 1:30 p.m. in New York, about 31 million
above its target level.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.68 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.64 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 697 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.82 billion cubic feet today, about 73 percent of its
capacity of 2.51 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.85
billion cubic feet at 1:20 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
