Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (OTLD) , North
Africa’s biggest mobile-phone operator, reported a fourth-
quarter net loss as revenue at its Algerian unit declined in
2010 amid restrictions imposed on the division by the
government.  The net loss for the quarter ended Dec. 31 was $178.8
million, compared with net income of $939.2 million in the third
quarter, Cairo-based Orascom Telecom said in a statement on its
website today. CI Capital and Beltone Financial had predicted
$78 million and $56 million in profit respectively. The company
posted full-year net income of $743.1 million, attributable to
equity holders of the parent. That compares with $317.3 million
a year earlier.  “Many restrictions on the operation still remain in
place,” Chief Executive Officer Khaled Bichara said in a
statement, referring to the Algerian unit. “Despite a number of
cost cutting initiatives being instigated in order to stabilize
and maintain network quality, restrictions imposed by the
Algerian government continue to negatively impact Djezzy’s
results.”  Orascom Telecom’s Djezzy unit posted a 6.5 percent decline
in revenue to $1.75 billion from $1.88 billion in 2009. Orascom
Telecom’s total revenue increased 2 percent to $3.83 billion
last year.  Orascom Telecom’s parent company, Wind Telecom SpA,
finalized a merger with Russia’s  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  last week,
creating the world’s sixth-biggest mobile phone company in a
$6.5 billion transaction. The deal was completed after Orascom
shareholders voted to nearly double their company’s capital to
14 billion Egyptian pounds ($2.4 billion), restructure debt and
create a new company to hold the assets not included in the
merger.  Orascom Telecom fell 4.1 percent to 4.21 pounds at the 2:30
p.m. close in Cairo, valuing the company at 22.1 billion pounds.
The company’s global depository receipts fell 12 percent to
$3.30 in  London .  To contact the reporters on this story:
