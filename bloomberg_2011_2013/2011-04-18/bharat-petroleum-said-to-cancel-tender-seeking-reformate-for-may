Bharat Petroleum  Corp., India’s
second-biggest state refiner, has canceled a tender seeking
10,000 metric tons of reformate for delivery in mid-May to
Mumbai, said two traders who participate in the market.  Bharat Petroleum canceled the tender after it decided
domestic supplies were sufficient, one of the people said today.
The traders declined to be identified as they aren’t authorized
to speak to the media.  Reformate is an unfinished form of gasoline that is
aromatic-rich and high in octane and is produced during the
refining of  crude oil .  Bharat Petroleum doesn’t plan to import gasoline over the
next two months because of the start-up of a new plant and the
postponing of maintenance at others, two people with knowledge
of the matter said April 11. The company’s Kochi refinery in
southern  India  produces reformate and it sought the cargo as a
back-up, one of the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
