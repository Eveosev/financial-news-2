Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  restarted a
sulfur unit shut at its Wilmington refinery in California after
the unit tripped offline.  “The unit is back online with no material impact to
production,” said Bill Day, a company spokesman, in an e-mail.  About 500 pounds of sulfur dioxide were released by
flaring, Valero said in a  filing  with the California Emergency
Management Agency.  The incident was caused by a breakdown, according to a
filing with the  South Coast Air Quality Management District .  The refinery has a capacity of 81,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
