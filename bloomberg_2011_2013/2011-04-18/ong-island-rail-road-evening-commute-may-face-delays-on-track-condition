Long Island Rail Road said it
anticipates “significant delays” during this evening’s rush
hour because of a track condition in one of the East River
tunnels.  The track condition, which  Amtrak  is working to repair, may
also result in canceled trains, the agency said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
