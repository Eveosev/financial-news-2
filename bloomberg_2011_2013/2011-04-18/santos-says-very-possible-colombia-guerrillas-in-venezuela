Colombian President  Juan Manuel Santos  said it is “very possible” that Colombian guerrillas
are operating in neighboring  Venezuela  and he trusts that
President  Hugo Chavez  isn’t offering them refuge.  Former President Alvaro Uribe questioned Santos’ comment
last week that Colombia’s largest guerrilla group no longer has
camps in Venezuela. Guerrilla leaders may still be hiding out in
Venezuela, Uribe said in an April 12 post to his Twitter
account.  “It is very possible that guerrillas are still in
Venezuela, no one has discarded that possibility," Santos said
in a statement on the presidential website today. ‘‘We have the
clear and resounding commitment from President Chavez not to
permit terrorist camps in his territory and signs of goodwill
with the capture and handing over of guerrillas.’’  Santos, who served as defense minister under Uribe,
authorized the extradition of alleged drug kingpin Walid Makled
to Venezuela April 13 after meeting with Chavez in Cartagena,
even after pressure from U.S. lawmakers for Makled to be sent
there for trial. President  Barack Obama  named Makled one of the
U.S.’s most-wanted foreign drug-traffickers.  The extradition helped Santos, who took office from Uribe
in August, patch up relations with Chavez after the socialist
revolutionary halted trade between the two countries and warned
of a possible war.  To contact the reporter on this story:
