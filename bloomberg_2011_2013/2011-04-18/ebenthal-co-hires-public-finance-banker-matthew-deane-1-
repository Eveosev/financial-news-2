Lebenthal & Co. hired Matthew P. Deane to help expand its public-finance business in  New York ,
the company said.  Deane, previously a banker with Hapoalim Securities, brings
more than 30 years of experience to Lebenthal and knows many of
the largest municipal borrowers, Alexandra Lebenthal, chief
executive officer, said today in a statement. Deane joins
Gregory Anderson as co-head of public finance, reporting to
James Sampson, head of capital markets.  The original Lebenthal & Co., started in 1925, was sold to
Mony Group Inc. in 2001. Merrill Lynch & Co. bought Mony’s
Advest unit in 2005, including the municipal-bond specialist,
and ceased using the brand. Alexandra and her father, James
“Jim” Lebenthal, revived the company name in 2008.  Last year, the firm participated in 35 corporate deals
totaling $30 billion and 59 municipal deals valued at $34
billion.
