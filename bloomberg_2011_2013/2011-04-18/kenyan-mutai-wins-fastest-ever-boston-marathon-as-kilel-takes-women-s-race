Geoffrey Mutai won the 115th  Boston
Marathon  in the fastest time ever for the distance, while
Caroline Kilel took the women’s race for a Kenyan sweep.  Mutai, 29, broke away from a small pack at about the 16th
mile and held on to win the 26.2-mile (42.2-kilometer) race from
Hopkinton,  Massachusetts , to Boston in 2 hours, 3 minutes, 2
seconds, besting Haile Gebrselassie’s time of 2:03:59 in Berlin
in 2008 as the fastest in history.  Mutai’s time eclipsed the Boston Marathon mark of 2:05:52
set by Robert Kiprono Cheruiyot of  Kenya  a year ago. Moses Mosop
of Kenya came in second this year at 2:03:06.  Although Mutai’s time is the fastest marathon ever run, it
isn’t a world record since  Boston  isn’t a record-eligible
course, according to the race’s website.  Ryan Hall, who split with coach Terrence Mahon and left
 California ’s Mammoth Track Club this year, was the top American
in the men’s race, finishing fourth at 2:04:58. Hall’s time is
the fastest by an American.  “This race will go down as maybe the greatest marathon
ever run and I was part of writing that story out there,” Hall
said in a televised interview.  Mutai and Kilel both received  $150,000  for their victories,
$100,000 each less than the first prizes at the Dubai Marathon,
the  world’s richest .  Their performances came a day after another Kenyan runner,
Emmanuel Mutai, set a London Marathon record of 2:04:40.  U.S. Finish  Kilel finished the women’s event in Boston in 2:22:36,
outkicking American Desiree Davila over the closing mile and
winning by two seconds. American Kara Goucher, who gave birth to
her first child in October, finished fifth in 2:24:52.  “That was my perfect day out there today,” Davila said in
a televised interview. “She was just better than I was. There
was nothing left in the legs. It was the most incredible
experience of my running career. I loved every second of it.”  Joan Benoit Samuelson, a 53-year-old two-time winner of the
women’s race, finished in 2:51:29. She was competing in the
Boston event for the first time in 18 years.  No U.S. runner has won the Boston Marathon since Lisa
Larsen Weidenbach took the women’s race in 1985. Americans
haven’t won both the men’s and women’s divisions since 1983,
when Greg Meyer was the last U.S. male champion.  Masazumi Soejima of  Japan  won the men’s push rim wheelchair
race in a sprint to the finish, while Wakako Tsuchida, also of
Japan, won the women’s push rim race for the fifth straight
time. Soejima overtook  Australia ’s  Kurt Fearnley , a two-time
paralympic champion, and  South Africa ’s Ernst Van Dyk, who was
seeking his 10th straight victory in Boston, over the closing
mile of the course.  To contact the reporter on this story:
