Moody’s Investors Service
downgraded the long-term deposit ratings of five Irish banks to
junk after last week’s downgrade of Irish government debt.  Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK) , Bank of Ireland, EBS Building
Society,  Irish Life & Permanent Group Holdings Plc (IPM)  were reduced
by two notches and ICS Building Society by one step, the ratings
company said in a statement today. Bank of Ireland and ICS are
rated Ba1, the highest junk rating, and the rest are ranked Ba2.  “The outlook on the long-term bank deposit and
unguaranteed senior unsecured debt ratings of these institutions
is negative, in line with the outlooks on the government rating
and on the stand-alone ratings of the banks,” Moody’s said.  The ratings company cut Ireland’s credit rating two levels
on April 15 to the lowest investment grade as the government
struggles to lower the  budget deficit  and restore economic
growth. Irish taxpayers may spend as much as 100 billion euros
($145 billion) trying to solve  Europe ’s worst banking crisis as
the country draws funds from last year’s bailout.  ICS is a unit of Bank of Ireland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
