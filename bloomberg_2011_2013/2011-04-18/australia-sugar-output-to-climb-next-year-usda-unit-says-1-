Sugar-cane production in  Australia 
will  rise  to 30 million metric tons in the year starting July 1,
a unit of the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said in a report
dated April 13 and posted today on its website. That compares
with estimated output of 27.35 million tons in the current year,
the USDA said.  Total sugar output will rise to 4 million tons next year,
the report said. The outlook for production in the current
season was lowered to 3.7 million tons from 4.8 million after
rains damaged crops, the USDA said. Total exports, including raw
and refined sweetener, will climb to 2.85 million tons from an
estimated 2.75 million a year earlier, the department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
