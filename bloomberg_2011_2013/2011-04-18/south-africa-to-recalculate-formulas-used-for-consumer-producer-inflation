South Africa  will “recalibrate”
the formulas used to calculate consumer and producer inflation,
Trevor Manuel, a minister in the presidency, said.  The Consumer Price Index formula will be based on the
income and expenditure survey done by Statistics South  Africa 
and will come into use in September, 2012, Manuel told reporters
in Cape Town today. The new Producer Price Index formula should
be in use by the first quarter of 2013, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
