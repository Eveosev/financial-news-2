A trial over  Rambus Inc. (RMBS) ’s
antitrust lawsuit against Micron Technology Inc. and  Hynix
Semiconductor Inc. (000660)  claiming $4.3 billion in alleged damages was
scheduled for June 7.  The trial date was posted today on the electronic docket
for the case in state court in  San Francisco .  Rambus, based in Sunnyvale, California, alleges that Micron
and Hynix artificially inflated the price of Rambus-designed
dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, chips to drive Rambus
technology out of the computer memory market. Samsung
Electronics Co. agreed to pay $900 million in a settlement that
removed it from the case.  A May 2 trial date for a separate patent-infringement
lawsuit by Rambus against Hynix and two other chipmakers in
federal court in San Jose, California, was vacated last month.
The judge in that case said March 25 that the trial should wait
until after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
Washington has decided related cases.  Linda Ashmore, a Rambus spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
return a message seeking comment.  The case is Rambus Inc. v.  Micron Technology Inc. (MU) , 04-
43115, Superior Court of California (San Francisco County).  To contact the reporters on this story:
