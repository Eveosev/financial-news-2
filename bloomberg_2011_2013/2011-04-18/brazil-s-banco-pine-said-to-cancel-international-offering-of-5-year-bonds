Banco Pine SA, a Brazilian lender
focused on loans to mid-sized companies, canceled its offering
of five-year international bonds.  The Sao Paulo-based lender decided to postpone the sale
because borrowing costs rose after  Standard & Poor’s  lowered its
outlook on the AAA credit rating of the  United States  to
negative, said a press official who declined to be identified in
accordance with company policy.  Banco Pine planned to sell as much as $300 million of the
debt, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Pine had hired BTG
Pactual SA, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Banco Santander SA to
arrange the sale, according to a person familiar with the
transaction who declined to be identified because he wasn’t
authorized to comment publicly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
