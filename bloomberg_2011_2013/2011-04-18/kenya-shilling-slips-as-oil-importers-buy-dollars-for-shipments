Kenya ’s shilling weakened as the
oil industry increased demand for dollars to pay for their
shipments.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy declined as
much as 0.3 percent to 84.13 per dollar and traded at 83.98 as
of 1:19 p.m. in Nairobi, from a previous close of 83.88.  “It seems there is increasing demand from the energy
sector, as the price of fuel has gone up,” Bernard Matimu, the
chief deal at Nairobi-based NIC Bank Ltd., said by phone today.  Kenya raised the maximum retail price for regular gasoline
in Nairobi, the capital, by 7.2 percent to 108.16 shillings
($1.29) per liter from April 15 as unrest in the Middle East and
North Africa, along with a growing appetite for fuels in India
and  China , are pushing global  oil prices  higher, said Kaburu
Mwirichia, director general of Kenya’s Energy Regulatory
Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
