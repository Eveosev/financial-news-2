Wheat futures jumped the most in a
month in Paris amid speculation that dry weather in  France  and
 Germany , the European Union’s biggest growers, may hurt
production this year.  Milling wheat for November delivery rose 9 euros, or 4.3
percent, to 217 euros a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in the French
capital, the most since March 17. The November contract, the
most-active contract in Paris, is the first for settlement
after this year’s EU wheat harvest.  Northern France has built up an “important” deficit in
water supply since the end of January, while German crops need
rain in coming weeks after a dry March, the EU’s Monitoring
Agricultural Resources unit said in a  report  dated April 12.  “The operators are starting to get concerned about the dry
conditions,” Jean Simon, an analyst at Bourges, France-based
farm adviser Offre et  Demande Agricole , said by phone. The
wheat “is growing rapidly. The need for water is now.”  Germany’s wheat harvest will be less than forecast a month
ago as a lack of rain in March and April is expected to hurt
yields, Berlin-based agriculture group Deutscher
Raiffeisenverband e.V. said today.  “In France, the situation isn’t yet critical, but it’s
delicate,” Simon said. “For the wheat, we’re really entering a
difficult period.”  Wheat for May delivery climbed 3.3 percent to 246 euros a
ton in the French capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
