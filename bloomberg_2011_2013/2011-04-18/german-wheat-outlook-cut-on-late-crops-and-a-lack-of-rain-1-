Wheat production in Germany, the
European Union’s second-largest grower, will rise less than
expected in March because the long winter and lack of rain are
expected to have hurt yields, Deutscher Raiffeisenverband e.V.
said.  German farmers will harvest 24.58 million metric tons of
wheat in 2011, up 2.2 percent from 24.05 million tons in 2010,
the Berlin-based agriculture association said on its  website 
today. That is less than the 2.6 percent gain forecast in March.  Crops in Germany need rain in coming weeks after a dry
March, the EU’s Monitoring Agricultural Resources unit said in a
 report  dated April 12. Wheat and rapeseed planting was delayed
last year after a wet fall.  “Field crops sown in the fall of 2010 are still slightly
behind in vegetation after the unusually long winter, and
vegetative development in many regions is anything but optimal
because of the sparse rainfall in March and April,” DRV said.  Total grain production is forecast to slide 0.5 percent to
44.06 million tons, compared with last month’s outlook for a
0.1-percent decline.  Barley Harvest  Winter soft-wheat output in  Germany  will climb 2.1 percent
to 24.23 million tons, 98,000 tons less than forecast a month
ago. The average yield is forecast at 7.42 tons per hectare
(2.47 acres), 30 kilograms (66 pounds) less than previously
expected.  Germany’s barley harvest will fall 8.9 percent to 9.49
million tons, the DRV said, compared with a 8.4 percent decline
expected in March.  The German rapeseed crop,  Europe ’s biggest, will slump 9.4
percent to 5.2 million tons as the planted area and yields
slide, the group said. In March, rapeseed production had been
forecast to decline 5.5 percent.  Corn production was raised and is forecast to climb 5.3
percent to 4.29 million tons in 2011 on increased yields,
compared with a previous outlook for the harvest to rise 4.4
percent.  France  is the EU’s largest wheat grower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
