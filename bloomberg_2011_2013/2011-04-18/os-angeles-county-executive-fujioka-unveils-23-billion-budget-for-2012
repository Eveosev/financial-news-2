William Fujioka, the chief
executive officer of  Los Angeles  County, whose population
exceeds that of 42 states, unveiled a $23.3 billion proposed
budget that cuts vacant jobs to help close a deficit.  Fujioka, who runs the nation’s  most-populous  county, with
9.8 million people, would erase a $220.9 million gap for the
fiscal year that begins in July with $185.2 million in one-time
funding measures and $35.7 million in spending cuts along with
eliminating 257 jobs, according to a  statement  from his office.  “The county is in much better financial shape than many
other municipalities because of the fiscal practices and long-
term budgeting discipline by the Board of Supervisors,” Fujioka
said in the statement.  Revenue has “rebounded slightly,” with an annual gain of
5 percent in sales taxes projected for fiscal 2012, according to
a budget presentation. Receipts from property levies are
forecast to increase less than 1 percent. Since fiscal 2007, the
number of general-relief cases, where indigent adults get
financial assistance, has almost doubled, to about 106,900 this
year from 58,600, according to the county.  The county supervisors will hold a public hearing on the
proposal starting May 11. The spending plan must pass the board
to become final.  Department budgets have been reduced 17 percent through the
past four years, according to the statement. Structural changes
have led to $406 million in cost cuts and the elimination of
more than 2,700 jobs in that time, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
