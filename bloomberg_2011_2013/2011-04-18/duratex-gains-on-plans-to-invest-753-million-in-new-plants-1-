Duratex SA (DTEX3) , a Brazilian producer of
wood panels and bathroom fixtures, gained after saying it will
invest 1.2 billion reais ($753 million) in two new wood panel
plants.  Shares rose 1.7 percent to 16.52 reais at the close of Sao
Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the most since April
7. The Bovespa index tumbled 1.9 percent to 65,415.49.  “Demand for wood panels in  Brazil  has grown faster than
the country’s GDP and is likely to keep growing,” Armando Halfeld, an analyst at Rio de Janeiro-based Ativa Corretora,
said in a telephone interview. “The company is getting ready
for this increasing demand and that’s positive news.”  One of the plants is scheduled to begin operating by the
end of 2012 while the other is planned for the end of 2014,
Duratex said in a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
