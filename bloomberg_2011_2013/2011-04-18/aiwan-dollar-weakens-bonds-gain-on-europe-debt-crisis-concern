Taiwan ’s dollar weakened for a
second day as investors sought the safety of the greenback on
speculation Greece may default on its debt.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10-most-traded currencies, dropped after Greece said it
had no plans for a restructuring even as the cost of insuring
its debt climbed to a record on April 15. China, the island’s
biggest trading partner, announced over the weekend it will
raise banks’ reserve-requirement ratios from April 21, and
People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said monetary
tightening will continue for “some time.”  “The Europe debt crisis weighed on the  Taiwan dollar ,”
said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader at Taiwan
Shin Kong Commercial Bank. “The  U.S. dollar  will probably stay
strong for the rest of the week.”  Taiwan’s dollar declined 0.1 percent to NT$29.089 against
its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc.  Government bonds were little changed. The yield on the 1
percent bond due January 2016, the most-active government
security, was at 1.072 percent, compared with 1.076 percent on
April 15, according to Gretai Securities Market, the island’s
biggest exchange for bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
