Raffaella Tenconi, an economist at
Bank of America Merrill Lynch in  London , comments on Polish wage
growth and the outlook for monetary policy.  Tenconi spoke in a phone interview.  Polish wage growth slowed in March, lagging behind the pace
of inflation. Average corporate wages rose 4 percent on the
year, down from 4.1 percent in February, the  Central Statistical
Office  said today in Warsaw.  The wage figures are “in line with our view that monetary
policy tightening is going to be very contained. It will
definitely strengthen the case of the dovish voters” on the
Monetary Policy Council.  “The economy is not generating inflationary pressures. At
the moment it’s clearly externally driven. We’re dovish on
monetary policy.  “We also have a below-consensus view on the economy.  “The oil shock and global uncertainty, especially the
continuing fiscal crisis in the euro region, means that the
private sector will have higher precautionary savings than
otherwise.”  BofA Merrill forecasts  Poland ’s economy will grow 3 percent
this year, Tenconi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
