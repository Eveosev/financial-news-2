Chile ’s congressional finance
committee meets with central bank President Jose De Gregorio to
discuss consumer credit rates from 1:45 p.m. New York time.  EQUITIES:
*The Ipsa index rose 0.3 percent to 4,669.87.
*Cap SA fell for the first time in three days, sliding 0.2
percent to 24,341 pesos. Chile’s largest steel producer and iron
miner said it’s conducting a “profound analysis” of its steel
production units and that the scenario for steel production
remains “difficult.”
*Cencosud SA climbed for a third day, gaining 1.2 percent to
3,508.6 pesos. Chile’s biggest retailer by sales is negotiating
the sale of $400 million in consumer loans with five banks to
help fund investments, Diario Financiero reported.  MARKETS:
*Chile’s peso had the first weekly decline in a month on dimming
trade prospects after copper, the country’s biggest export, fell
the most in five weeks. The peso weakened 0.2 percent last week
to 471.05 per U.S. from 469.91 per dollar on April 8.
*Foreign investors in the forwards market had a $2 billion net
bet that the peso would fall against the dollar as of April 13,
according to central bank data.

expectations. The one-year inflation-linked swap rate climbed

percent while the two-year fell 15 basis points to 3.93 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
