Hungary’s new constitution, which
opposition leaders criticized for weakening checks and balances,
reinforces concerns about the policies of Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s government, according to the German Foreign Ministry.  The constitution, approved by Parliament today in the face
of protests and a boycott by two opposition parties, again
raises concern for minority rights, Deputy Foreign Minister
Werner Hoyer said. The  United Nations  and journalism watchdogs
earlier this year said Hungary’s new media law, which created a
regulator staffed by Orban’s allies, could stifle press freedom.  “Our fears that arose with the media laws are reinforced
rather than alleviated with the constitution that was passed
today,” Hoyer said in an e-mailed statement.  The constitution is the climax of Orban’s “ballot-box
revolution” after his election victory a year ago, in which he
won a two-thirds majority in parliament. While the government
says the constitution completes the transition to democracy that
began after the fall of communism, opponents say it amounts to a
“constitutional coup.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
