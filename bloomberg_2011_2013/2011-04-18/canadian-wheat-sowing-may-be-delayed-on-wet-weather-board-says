Wheat planting in  Canada  may be 10
days to three weeks behind normal because of cool weather and
precipitation, the Canadian Wheat Board said.  Rain caused flooding and prevented fields from drying out,
and snow remains on the ground in the northern Prairies, the
agency said in an e-mailed  statement . Planting normally begins
by the last week of April. Floods have had “little impact” on
wheat transportation, the board said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
