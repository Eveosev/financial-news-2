European Union carbon permits were
little changed from last week’s close after rising to their
highest price in 12 days, as power utilities hedge forward sales
of electricity generated from fossil fuels.  EU emission allowances for December rose as much as 0.6
percent to 17.23 euros ($24.70) a metric ton on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange in  London , the highest price since April 6. They
were at 17.12 euros as of 8:59 a.m., the same as last week’s
close. German power for 2012 rose 5 cents to 59.20 euros a
megawatt hour, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
