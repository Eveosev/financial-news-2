Asos Plc (ASC) , the online clothes
retailer, is being sued in a Hamburg regional court by German
men’s wear retailer Anson’s over the company’s name, which
Anson’s argues is similar to its own, the Financial Times
reported without saying where it got the information.  Anson’s is asking the court to prohibit Asos from using the
name to sell clothes in  Germany , the FT said. The company
“welcomes healthy competition but not to the extent it may
confuse customers and dilute our valuable and long-standing
brand,” the FT reported, citing a representative of Anson’s. An
Asos spokesman said Anson’s are “clearly being opportunistic,”
and Asos was fighting the claims “vigorously,” the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
