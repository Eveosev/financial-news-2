Banks in the U.K. and U.S. that
threaten to relocate to other countries rather than submit to
stricter rules are not likely to be able to do so, Svein
Andresen, secretary general of the Financial Stability Board
said at the International Monetary Fund spring meeting in
 Washington , the  Daily Telegraph  reported. Countries the banks
might contemplate moving to may well refuse to accept them since
they would be responsible for any potential bailout, the
newspaper cited Andresen as saying.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
