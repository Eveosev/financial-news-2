Spanish home prices fell for the
10th quarter as sellers scaled back their demands in a bid to
complete sales before interest rates rose, deterring potential
buyers.  The average price of houses and apartments declined 4.6
percent in the three months through March from a year earlier,
the Housing Ministry said today on its website from  Madrid .
Prices dropped 2.5 percent from the previous quarter, in the
12th quarterly decline.  Spain, which has the highest  unemployment rate  in Europe
after almost two years of recession, also has the highest ratio
of outstanding floating-rate  mortgage loans  in the region,
according to data compiled by the European Mortgage Federation.  “Rate rises discourage buyers and sellers dropped asking
prices before rates increased to encourage sales,” said
Fernando Encinar, head of research at Idealista.com, Spain’s
largest property  website .  The European Central Bank raised the benchmark interest
rate to 1.25 percent on April 7 after keeping it at a record low
of 1 percent since May 2009 to fight the financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
