Moser Baer India Ltd. (MBI) , the
countryâ€™s second-largest maker of solar cells, completed its
first project to convert the exterior of a building to produce
power from the sun.  Window panes at a shopping mall in Hyderabad in the
southern state of  Andhra Pradesh  were replaced with 24 solar
panels based on thin-film technology with an installed capacity
of 1.8 kilowatts, the company said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The global market for projects that integrate solar panels
into building facades is expected to expand almost 10-fold to
11,392 megawatts by 2015, according to the statement.  Most solar panels convert sunlight into electricity using
traditional silicon-based cells. Thin-film modules use less
costly photovoltaic coatings, such as cadmium telluride.  Moser Baer produces thin-film modules at its plant in
Noida, which has a capacity of 90 megawatts per year, according
to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
