The  Czech Republic ’s electricity
use may increase by 26 percent in the next two decades,
according to OTE AS, the country’s power market operator.  Total power consumption is forecast to jump to 74.6
terawatt-hours in 2030 from 59.3 terawatt-hours this year, OTE
said in a  statement  posted on its website.  Consumption will be fueled by an expected increase in
industrial production as well as growing use of electric
vehicles, which will start making a dent by 2020, according to
the OTE study. The boost will benefit  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the state-
controlled utility that produces 75 percent of the nation’s
electricity.  “The Czech Republic has sufficient capacity, which enables
it to cover domestic demand and to export the remaining surplus
while maintaining a healthy reserve margin,” the Paris-based
 International Energy Agency  said in its 2010 country report.
“Planned capacity additions are sufficient to meet expected
demand growth.”  CEZ plans to boost its output by renovating older coal-
fired power plants and building two reactors at its Temelin
atomic plant. The utility’s share price has been boosted by
Germany’s decision to shut its oldest atomic reactors and
accelerate its exit from nuclear power following last month’s
disaster at Japan’s Fukushima plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
