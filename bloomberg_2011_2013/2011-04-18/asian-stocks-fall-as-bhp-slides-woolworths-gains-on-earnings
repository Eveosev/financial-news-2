Asian stocks rose, with the
regional index set for its biggest advance in nearly a month, as
U.S. housing starts gained and earnings beat estimates at
companies including Johnson & Johnson, signaling the world’s
biggest economy is recovering.  Advantest,  Japan ’s largest maker of chip-testing equipment,
gained 3.4 percent after  Intel Corp. (INTC)  forecast quarterly sales
that may top estimates.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest
mining company, gained 1.2 percent in Sydney after metals and
oil prices rose. Samsung Electronics Co. gained 4.7 percent in
 Seoul  after it agreed to sell its computer hard-disk drive
business.  LG Chem Ltd. (051910) ,  South Korea ’s biggest chemicals maker,
jumped 5.6 percent after posting a 27 percent gain in first-
quarter profit.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 1.8 percent to 136.69
at 6:26 p.m. in  Tokyo , its biggest gain since March 22. About
five shares gained for each that fell on the 1,023-member gauge.
The measure fell 0.5 percent last week, reversing three weeks of
gains.  “Demand in the U.S., while it may not have the strength it
once did, is slowly heading toward a recovery,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a senior strategist in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset
Management Co., which oversees $84 billion. “Yesterday we saw
that housing in the U.S. was good, which means that the  U.S.
economy  is improving, and that’s being appreciated by the market
today.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average advanced 1.8 percent.
 Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index climbed 1.4 percent and  New
Zealand ’s NZX 50 Index increased 1 percent. South Korea’s Kospi
index rose 2.2 percent, the biggest gain among benchmark indexes
in the region.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.6 percent while  China ’s
Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index climbed 0.3 percent.  U.S. Housing Starts  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1.2 percent
today, the biggest advance since March 21. In  New York , the
index advanced 0.6 percent yesterday after the Commerce
Department said housing starts increased 7.2 percent in March
from the previous month. Work began on 549,000 homes, exceeding
the 520,000 median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News.  Johnson & Johnson, the world’s second-biggest seller of
health products, forecast full-year earnings for 2011 will be
$4.90 to $5 a share, more than a January forecast of $4.80 to
$4.90, after quarterly profit beat estimates as the result of
new drugs and a weaker dollar.  Intel Revenue Forecasts  Information technology shares rose 2 percent today, the
most among the MSCI Asia Pacific index’s 10 industry groups.  In Tokyo, Advantest rose 3.4 percent to 1,452 yen.  Tokyo
Electron Ltd. (8035) , Japan’s biggest producer of chipmaking equipment,
jumped 4.1 percent to 4,475 yen. Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest contract chipmaker,
advanced 2.5 percent to NT$69.8 in Taipei.  Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, said revenue will be
$12.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million. That compares with
$11.9 billion, the average of analysts’ projections compiled by
Bloomberg.  “You’re seeing signs the U.S. and  Europe  are still on
track for recovery,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager
in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. “That’s helped to ease
nerves.”  Raw material producers had the second-largest advance among
the MSCI Asia Pacific index’s subgroups today.  Commodities Rise  BHP climbed 1.2 percent to A$47.23, the second-biggest
boost to the MSCI index. Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-
largest mining company by sales, advanced 1.2 percent to A$83.12.
 Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s largest oil and gas explorer, jumped 3.1
percent to 601,000 yen.  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  China’s largest offshore
energy producer, gained 3 percent to HK$19.46.  Crude oil for June delivery gained 0.6 percent yesterday to
$108.12 a barrel in New York after the U.S. housing starts data
stoked speculation that fuel demand may increase. The London
Metal Exchange Index of six metals including copper and aluminum
increased 1 percent, the biggest gain in almost two weeks.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 2.5 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 4.4 percent by the S&P
500 and a decline of 0.5 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.9 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.5 times for the  S&P 500 
and 11 times for the Stoxx 600.  Samsung Sells Unit  Among other stocks that rose, Samsung Electronics, the
world’s largest maker of memory chips, advanced 4.7 percent to
916,000 won, the biggest support to the MSCI index. Seagate
Technology Plc agreed to buy Samsung’s unprofitable hard-disk
drive business for $1.38 billion, allowing Samsung to focus on
its chip business, the company said.  LG Chem also rose in Seoul, jumping 5.6 percent to 549,000
won, its highest close on record. The company’s petrochemical
business will sustain “high profitability” in the second
quarter as plant maintenance by rivals will limit supply at a
time when demand for chemicals is rising, Chief Executive
Officer Kim Bahn Suk told investors yesterday. Net income rose
to 656.6 billion won ($601 million) in the three months ended
March 31 from 517.7 billion won a year earlier, the company said.  LG Corp. (003550) , the holding company of South Korea’s LG Group
including LG Chem, surged 10 percent to 96,600 won in Seoul, the
biggest gain on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, after Daishin
Securities Co. said the shares are “excessively undervalued.”
The shares are headed for their highest close since January 2000.  To contact the reporters on this story:
