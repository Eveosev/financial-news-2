JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  plans to
double the number of people it employs in Brazil as it seeks to
exploit opportunities in asset management, corporate finance and
other areas, the Financial Times reported, citing Claudio Berquo, the bankâ€™s chief executive officer for Brazil.  The headcount, 630 at present, will be increased by another
150 in the next 12 months and the aim is a total of 1,100 to
1,200 in the medium term; the number of cities covered will rise
from three to five, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
