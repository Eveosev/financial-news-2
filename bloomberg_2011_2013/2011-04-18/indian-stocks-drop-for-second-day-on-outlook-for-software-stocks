Indian equities declined, led by
software makers, on concern that lower-than-expected earnings
from  Infosys Technologies Ltd. (INFO)  may presage smaller margins for
its domestic peers.  Infosys, the nation’s second-biggest software exporter,
fell for a second day, losing 2.9 percent, after it was cut to
“neutral” from “outperform” by Credit Suisse Group AG on
“disappointing” results and “poor margin guidance.”  Tata
Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the largest, dropped 3.6 percent.  “Investors are selling software shares on fears further
margin erosion will affect profits,” said Sunil Pachisia, vice
president of Pratibhuti Viniyog Ltd., a brokerage in Mumbai.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
291.80, or 1.5 percent, to 19,095.02, according to preliminary
closing prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The S&P CNX Nifty Index
on the National Stock Exchange fell 1.6 percent to 5,731.60, and
its April futures were at 5,739. The BSE 200 Index declined 1.4
percent to 2,363.38.  To contact the reporter on this story:
