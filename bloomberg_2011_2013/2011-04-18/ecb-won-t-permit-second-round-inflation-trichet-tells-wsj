The  European Central Bank  “will
not accept second-round effects” of inflation in the euro area,
ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an interview,      The ECB is “trying to deliver price stability in the
medium term” and  interest rates  were raised at the last policy
meeting “precisely to be sure” that this will occur, Trichet
said, according to the WSJ.    “Until now, I do not see alarming second-round effects,”
Trichet said, the Journal reported. “There are some signs here
and there that are not going in the right direction,” the
newspaper reported Trichet as saying.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
