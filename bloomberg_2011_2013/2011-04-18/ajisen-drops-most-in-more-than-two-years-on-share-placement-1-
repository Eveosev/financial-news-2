Ajisen (China) Holdings Ltd., an
operator of Japanese-style casual restaurants, plunged the most
in more than two years in  Hong Kong  trading after its chairman
sold shares in the company.  Ajisen tumbled 11 percent, the most since Oct. 10, 2008, to
HK$15.16 at the 4 p.m. close in trading. The benchmark  Hang Seng
Index  fell 0.7 percent.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Poon Wai placed 63.6
million shares held through wholly owned Favor Choice Group Ltd.
for sale at HK$15.30 each, Ajisen said in a statement to the
Hong Kong stock exchange. It’s the first time Favor Choice has
sold shares since Ajisen’s initial public offering in March
2007, according to the statement.  “Placement may cause investor concerns on Ajisen’s
outlook,” Charles Yan and Catherine Chen, analysts at Yuanta
Securities HK Co., said in a report today. “After the placement
management will lose absolute control.”  Poon Wai placed his shares on April 15 through Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., according to the statement. The placement will
be completed on April 20 and reduce Favor Choice’s stake to
44.09 percent of the company. Poon also directly owns 1.8
percent of the stock.  Ajisen got 89 percent of its 2010 sales from mainland
 China , with the rest from Hong Kong, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Its shares gained more than threefold from its IPO
offer price of HK$5.47, before today’s drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
