An offshore unit of Galleon Group
LLC sold a $146.7 million claim on  Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. (LEHMQ) , according to a court filing.  Galleon Buccaneerâ€™s Offshore Ltd. sold the claim for an
undisclosed price to Whatley Place LLC on Oct. 29, according to
the April 15 filing in U.S.  Bankruptcy Court  in New York. The
transfer document was signed by Galleon director Richard
Schutte.  Claims on Lehman, which filed the biggest bankruptcy in
U.S. history in 2008, trade daily among investors and banks in
advance of court hearings on a $61 billion liquidation plan for
the defunct investment bank.  The Galleon offshore investment vehicle was named in the
insider-trading trial of co-founder Raj Rajaratnam last month.  The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
