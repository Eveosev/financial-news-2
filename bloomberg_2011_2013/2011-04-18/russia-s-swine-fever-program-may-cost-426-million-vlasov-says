Russia  would need to spend up to 12
billion rubles ($426 million) over seven years to fight African
swine fever, said Nikolai Vlasov, deputy chief of
 Rosselkhoznadzor , the country’s food safety watchdog.  The program would include laboratories and incentives to
encourage farmers to switch from pig breeding to other
livestock, Vlasov said at a press conference in Moscow today.
The money would come from federal spending, Rosselkhoznadzor
spokesman Alexei Alekseenko said.  The virus is mostly in Russia’s Southern and North-Caucasus
Federal Districts. About 17,000 pigs died or were slaughtered
this year in Russia because of the disease, on top of 60,000
last year, according to Rosselkhoznadzor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
