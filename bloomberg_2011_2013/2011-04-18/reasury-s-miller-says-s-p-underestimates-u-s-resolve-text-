Following are extracts from a
statement by U.S. Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets  Mary Miller  today. It was released after  Standard & Poor’s  put a
“negative” outlook on the U.S. AAA credit rating. It was
published by the Treasury in  Washington  via e-mail.  “This morning, S&P affirmed the AAA rating of the U.S.,
but emphasized the importance of timely bipartisan cooperation
and action on fiscal reform.”  “As the president said last week, addressing the current
fiscal situation is well within our capacity as a country. He
has initiated a bipartisan process that will allow us to make
progress on a balanced approach to restoring fiscal
responsibility. The  U.S. economy  is strengthening as it emerges
from the recent recession. Both political parties now agree that
it is time to begin bringing down deficits as a share of GDP.  “S&P assumes that the U.S. will enact ‘a comprehensive
budgetary consolidation program -- combined with meaningful
steps toward implementation by 2013,’ but we believe S&P’s
negative outlook underestimates the ability of America’s leaders
to come together to address the difficult fiscal challenges
facing the nation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
