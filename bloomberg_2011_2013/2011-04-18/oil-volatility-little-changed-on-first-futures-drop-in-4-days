Oil options volatility was little
changed as front-month futures tumbled for the first time in
four days after Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said the
global market is oversupplied.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 27.66 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 27.73 percent April 15.  Oil for May delivery plunged $2.54, or 2.3 percent, to
settle at $107.12 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Prices are up 29 percent from a year ago. June futures, which
become the front month after the May contract expires tomorrow,
fell $2.53, or 2.3 percent, to $107.69.  The most active contracts in electronic trading were June
$130 calls with 3,013 lots changing hands. They slipped 13 cents
to 12 cents a barrel. June $100 puts, the next most active
contract, rose 20 cents to 74 cents a barrel with 2,602
contracts trading. One contract is for 1,000 barrels of oil.  May options expired April 14.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  June $125 calls were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 10,941 lots changing hands. They rose 3
cents to 45 cents a barrel. The next most active option, June
$130 calls, were unchanged at 25 cents a barrel on 9,915 lots.  Open interest was highest for June $150 calls with 43,859
contracts. Next were December 2012 $80 puts with 43,312 and June
$120 calls with 39,022.  To contact the reporter on this story:
