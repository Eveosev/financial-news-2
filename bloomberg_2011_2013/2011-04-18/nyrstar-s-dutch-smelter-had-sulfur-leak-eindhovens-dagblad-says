Nyrstar (NYR)  NV briefly suspended some
operations at its zinc smelter in the Dutch town of Budel on
April 15 following a gas leakage, Het Eindhovens Dagblad
reported on its website, citing the site’s production manager.  Operations at the Budel smelter were suspended shortly
after 9 a.m. local time following a leakage of sulfur trioxide
at the sulfuric-acid unit, the newspaper said. Employees were
able to return to their positions after a 15-minute evacuation
and operations at the sulfuric-acid plant resumed at about 2
p.m. local time, according to Eindhovens Dagblad.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
