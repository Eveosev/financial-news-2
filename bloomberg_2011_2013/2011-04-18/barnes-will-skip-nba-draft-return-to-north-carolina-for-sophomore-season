University of North Carolina 
forward Harrison Barnes, the Atlantic Coast Conference Rookie of
the Year, will return to school for his sophomore season, the
school announced on its website.  Barnes, 18, will skip the chance to enter the National
Basketball Association draft to continue his education at the
 Chapel Hill , North Carolina-based university. ESPN rated Barnes
as the No. 3 prospect for the draft.  “I’m here to experience college life, grow as a person,
receive a quality education and be part of the greatest
basketball family in college sports,” Barnes said on the
website.  A native of Ames,  Iowa , Barnes scored 15.7 points per game
in his freshman season, tied for the team high. He averaged 21
points in the Tar Heels’ four  National Collegiate Athletic
Association  tournament games.  The Tar Heels were 29-8 this season, won the ACC regular-
season title and advanced to the regional finals of the NCAA
tournament. Barnes, junior Tyler Zeller and sophomore John
Henson, the team’s three leading scorers, have all announced
their intention to return to school next year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
