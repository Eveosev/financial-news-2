Novartis AG (NOVN) , Europe’s second-
largest drugmaker by sales, failed to win the backing of the
U.K.  National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence  for
the Afinitor tumor-fighting drug.  The medicine doesn’t provide enough of a benefit to
patients with advanced kidney cancer to justify its high cost,
even with a manufacturer rebate of 5 percent, the agency, known
as NICE, said in an e-mailed statement today. The total cost of
the product would have been 34,235 pounds ($55,700) for each
patient for one year, the agency said in its final guidelines on
Afinitor. NICE advises the U.K.’s  National Health Service  on the
cost-effectiveness of treatments.  The agency already recommends  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s Sutent and
 GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) ’s Votrient for the disease.  To contact the reporter on this story:
