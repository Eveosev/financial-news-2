Canada ’s dollar fell to the lowest
in almost two weeks against its U.S. counterpart as yields on
Greek and Portuguese bonds rose to records, damping demand for
riskier assets.  The Canadian currency weakened as crude oil futures fell
and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services revised its outlook on
the long-term U.S. debt rating to negative from stable. It rose
versus the euro as Finland’s euro-skeptic bloc won support in
yesterday’s election, is a protest against funding euro-region
bailouts. Overseas investors cut their holdings of Canadian
bonds for the first time since 2008.  “Clouds on the horizon in peripheral countries in the  euro
zone  seem to be putting the market in risk-off stance,” said
Matt Perrier, director of foreign-exchange sales at Bank of
Montreal’s BMO Capital Markets unit in Toronto. It’s “standard
market reaction to what we’ve seen when the market starts paying
attention to headlines coming out of  Europe .”  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, weakened 1.1
percent to 96.93 cents per  U.S. dollar  at 10:57 a.m. in Toronto
from 95.92 on April 15. It touched the weakest since April 5.
The Canadian dollar rose 0.4 percent to C$1.3784 per euro. One
Canadian dollar buys $1.0317.  Oil,  Raw Materials   Crude oil futures fell 2.4 percent to $107 a barrel in  New
York . The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials
lost 1.2 percent. Raw materials, including oil, account for
about half of Canada’s exports.  Greek two-year note yields were 90 basis points higher at
19.40 percent. Portuguese 10-year bonds fell, pushing the yield
as much as 28 basis points higher to 9.28 percent, the most
since at least 1997.  Canadian  government bonds  rose, pushing the yield on the
benchmark 10-year down six basis points, 0.06 percentage point,
to 3.23 percent. The price of the 3.5 percent security maturing
in June 2020 added 50 cents to C$102.10.  S&P affirmed its AAA long-term and A-1+ short-term
sovereign credit ratings on the U.S. and revised its outlook on
the long-term rating to negative from stable.  “Canada is guilty by association,” said  Dean Popplewell , an
analyst in Toronto at the online currency-trading firm Oanda
Corp. “Canada is being thrown into the same boat as the U.S. and
it’s guilty by association because of the trade ties we have
with our largest southern partner.”  Investment Flows  Foreign investors bought a net C$2.50 billion ($2.60
billion) of Canadian securities in February, the smallest total
in almost a year, as increased holdings of stocks were curbed by
the first net sale of bonds since December 2008.  Foreign investors bought C$4.93 billion of stocks during
the month,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. Non-residents
also sold C$1.59 billion of bonds, led by federal  government
securities , and divested of C$843 million of money-market paper.
Economists predicted a C$10 billion net purchase of Canadian
securities, according to the median of five estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  The loonie is down 0.8 percent during this year in the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, a measure of
the 10 developed-nation currencies. The greenback lost 3.8
percent.  To contact the reporters for this story:
