A group including New York-based
real estate investor Mark Karasick bought Pittsburgh’s  tallest 
building, the 64-story U.S. Steel  Tower , for $250 million.  The investors acquired the entity that owned the building
from Area Property Partners LP, Karasick said today in a
telephone interview. Tenants in the 2.9 million-square-foot
(269,000-square-meter) tower at 600 Grant St. include  UPMC , the
nonprofit health care operation affiliated with the  University
of Pittsburgh .  The property is 94 percent occupied, Karasick said.
Pittsburgh began shifting in the early 1980s from its dwindling
steel industry to an economy based on education, medicine and
technology. Pittsburgh’s office vacancy rate was 11.2 percent at
the end of 2010, lower than the U.S. average of 16.4 percent,
according to CB Richard Ellis, a Los Angeles-based broker.  “We like Pittsburgh a lot,” Karasick said. “They’ve re-
created themselves.”  A loan backed by the property was sent to a special
servicer in September after the borrower couldn’t pay the debt,
according to Bloomberg data. Area Property has paid the debt
associated with the property, Karasick said.  The investor group has borrowed $220 million from UBS AG to
make the purchase, Karasick said.  A message left for Julie Solomon, a spokeswoman for New
York-based Area Property, was not immediately returned.  The sale was reported Saturday by the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette.  To contact the reporter on this story:
