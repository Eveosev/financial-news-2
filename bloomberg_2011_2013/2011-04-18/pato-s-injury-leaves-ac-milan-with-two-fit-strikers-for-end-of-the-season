Brazilian forward  Alexandre Pato 
will probably miss most of Serie A leader AC Milan’s remaining
games after suffering a thigh injury, the club said on its
website.  “Chief Medical Officer Dr. Gianluca Melegati announces
that medical tests carried out this morning have revealed a
flexor strain in Alexandre Pato’s right thigh,” the club said
today in a statement. “The player is expected to be out for 2
to 3 weeks.”  Pato’s absence comes at the same time leading scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic serves a three-game ban for a red card in a league
game on April 11. The duo’s absence leaves Robinho and Antonio Cassano as Milan’s only two available forwards.  Milan stretched its lead in the standings to six points
after a 3-0 home win over Sampdoria two days ago. The team owned
by Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  is trying to clinch
a first national championship since it won its 17th title in
2004. There are five matches remaining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
