Terms for the future European
Stability Mechanism agreed on by European leaders in March have
potential deficiencies and require tightening before they can be
fully accepted by member states, according to the Bundesbank,
whose findings will likely support skeptics in  Germany .  The agreements, forged by the European Council at a March
24-25 summit, contain “imprecise” rules on voting aid for debt
plagued states from 2013 and potentially “contradictory” rules
on the roles of private creditors, said the central bank in its
latest monthly report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
