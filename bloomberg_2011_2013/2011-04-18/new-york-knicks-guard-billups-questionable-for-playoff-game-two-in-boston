New York Knicks point guard
 Chauncey Billups  is listed as questionable for the team’s second
playoff game against the  Boston Celtics  tomorrow, team spokesman
Jonathan Supranowitz said in an e-mail.  Billups strained his left knee in the Knicks’ 87-85 loss to
the Celtics yesterday in the opening game of the National
Basketball Association playoffs. The 34-year-old guard didn’t
practice with the team today, Supranowitz said.  Billups was acquired with Carmelo Anthony in a trade with
the Denver Nuggets on Feb. 22. In 21 games since coming to New
York, Billups is averaging 17.5 points and 5.5 assists. He has
played in 140 postseason games, the most on New York’s roster.  Toney Douglas and Anthony Carter, who have played a
combined 37 playoff games, would likely see increased time if
Billups cannot play. Should he miss tomorrow’s game, Billups
would have three additional days to rest for Game 3 on April 22
at  New York ’s Madison Square Garden.  To contact the reporter on this story:
