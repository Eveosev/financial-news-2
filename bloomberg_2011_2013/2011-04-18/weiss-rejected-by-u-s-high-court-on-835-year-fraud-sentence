The U.S. Supreme Court rejected an
appeal from Sholam Weiss, a businessman who fled the country
before being sentenced to 845 years in prison for defrauding
National Heritage Life Insurance Co. of millions of dollars.  Weiss contended that the U.S., in order to secure his
extradition from  Austria  in 2000, had promised he would be re-
sentenced. A federal appeals court concluded that Weiss was
entitled only to the dismissal of one count and a 10-year
reduction in the sentence, leaving him with an 835-year term.  The case is Weiss v. Yates, 10-384.  To contact the reporter on this story:
