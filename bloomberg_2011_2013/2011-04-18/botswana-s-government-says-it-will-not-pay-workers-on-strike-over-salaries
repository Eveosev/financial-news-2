Botswana’s government won’t pay
state employees who begin a strike over pay today, Festinah
Bakwena, director of the Department of Public Service
Management, said on state television yesterday.  The workers are demanding a pay rise of 16 percent while
the government has offered 5 percent. Botswana’s annual
inflation was unchanged at 8.5 percent in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
