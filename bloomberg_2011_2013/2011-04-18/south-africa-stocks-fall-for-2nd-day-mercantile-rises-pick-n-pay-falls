The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index
declined for a second day, losing 313.64, or 1 percent, to
31,914.02 as of 2:03 p.m. in Johannesburg.  The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , the diversified mining company
that makes up 11 percent of  South Africa ’s benchmark stock
index, fell to the lowest since March 23, losing 6.11 rand, or
1.8 percent, to 342.89 rand. Copper dropped for a sixth day,
declining as much as 0.6 percent to $9,374 a metric ton in
 London  after  China , the world’s largest consumer of the metal,
stepped up its credit-tightening measures by raising lenders’
reserve requirements for the fourth time this year, less than
two weeks after an interest-rate increase.  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL)  , the world’s largest mining company, fell for a second day,
dropping 1.60 rand, or 0.6 percent, to 278.50 rand.  Coal of Africa Ltd. (CZA)  , a producer of the fuel,
headed for the lowest close since March 31, slipping 53 cents,
or 6 percent, to 8.32 rand. The company said only the “worst-
case scenario” would result in it abandoning its Vele coal
project in South Africa, which had a regulatory compliance
notice imposed by authorities in the country. “Should the
compliance notice not be lifted, we would have no option but to
close the colliery,” Chief Executive Officer John Wallington
said in a statement today.  Eastern Platinum Ltd. (EPS)  , a producer of the metal in
South Africa, headed for the lowest close since Sept. 10,
dropping 60 cents, or 6.4 percent, to 8.80 rand. The company
said production at its Crocodile River Mine fell to 25,387
ounces in the three months through March compared with 32,752
ounces in the previous quarter. Eastern Platinum didn’t
immediately specify whether the production was for platinum or
platinum group metals.  Mercantile Bank Holdings Ltd. (MTL)  , the lender
controlled by  Portugal ’s Caixa Geral de Depositos SA, advanced
for the first time in a week, gaining 2 cents, or 10 percent, to
22 cents. The lender said it has entered into acquisition talks,
which may have a material effect on its shares.  Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. (PIK)  , South Africa’s second-
biggest retailer, retreated to the lowest intraday level since
Oct. 20, slipping 2.25 rand, or 5.1 percent, to 41.95 rand. The
company expects the difficult trading conditions that
contributed to a drop in fiscal 2011 profit to continue, Chief
Executive Officer Nick Badminton said in a presentation in
today. Pick n Pay Holdings Ltd. (PWK SJ), the company that
controls Pick n Pay Stores, headed for the lowest level since
Oct. 25, declining 71 cents, or 3.8 percent, to 17.79 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
