China , the world’s largest coal
producer, boosted output by 8.3 percent in the first quarter
compared with a year earlier to meet rising demand, according to
the national coal association.  Production increased to 792 million metric tons, China
National Coal Association said in a  statement  on its website.
Output gained 12 percent to 276 million tons in March from
February and fell 1.4 percent from a year earlier, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on government data.  Coal production gained “rapidly” in the first quarter as
some mines resumed output following restructuring, the official
 Xinhua News Agency  said in a report April 17, citing the
association. Sales in the first quarter rose 6.8 percent to 760
million tons after rail links opened, easing transport
bottlenecks, it reported.  Coal imports declined in the first three months while
exports rose “slightly,” Xinhua said, without giving details.
Inventories dropped slowly and prices are stable, it said.  China’s net coal imports declined 67 percent to 5 million
tons in February from January after overseas coal costs
increased, Chinese customs said March 21. Exports totaled 2.59
million tons in March, the customs said April 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
