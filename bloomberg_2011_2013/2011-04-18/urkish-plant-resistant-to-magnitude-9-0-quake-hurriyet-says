A nuclear power plant being built
by two Russian companies on  Turkey â€™s Mediterranean coast will
withstand a magnitude-9.0 earthquake such as the one that
damaged reactors in  Japan ,  Hurriyet  newspaper reported.  The plant will also be built to withstand a tsunami, even
if its electricity supply is cut off, Hurriyet said, citing
comments by Alexander Superfin, general manager of the Akkuyu
Nuclear Power Plant Co.  The radiation leak in March at Fukushima, Japan, which has
reactors built using 1960s technology, would be impossible in
Turkey with the new design and security measures, Superfin said.
He said he expected support from the government to overcome
public opposition to the project, the newspaper reported.  The first phase of the plant will be completed in 2019 if
construction begins in mid-2013, Hurriyet quoted Superfin as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
