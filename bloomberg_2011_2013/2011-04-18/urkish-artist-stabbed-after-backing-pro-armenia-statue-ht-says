Turkish painter Bedri Baykam was
stabbed after leaving a meeting to express support for the maker
of a pro-Armenia statue that Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan 
called a “freak” or “monstrosity,”  Haberturk  reported.  The news channel didn’t name a suspect or motivation for
the stabbing in Istanbul.  Preparations began today to destroy sculptor Mehmet Aksoy’s
30-meter stone statue in the eastern Turkish region of Kars,
which was meant to symbolize friendship between Turks and
Armenians. Erdogan criticized the statue in January.  Baykam was taken to a hospital after the attack, Haberturk
said without giving further details on the incident.  To contact the reporter on this story:
