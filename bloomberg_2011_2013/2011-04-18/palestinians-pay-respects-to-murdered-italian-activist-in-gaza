Hundreds of Palestinians paid their
respects to a murdered Italian activist from the pro-Palestinian
International Solidarity Movement, who was found dead by Hamas
last week in the northern  Gaza Strip .  International activists, Italian consular staff and
relatives also attended the gathering today at Al-Shifa hospital
before the body of Vittorio Arrigoni was taken to the Rafah
border crossing, from where it will be taken to  Italy  via  Egypt .  Arrigoni, 36, was found shot dead at a house at dawn on
April 15, hours after members of an al-Qaeda-inspired group, al-
Tawheed and al-Jihad, said in a video that it had abducted him.
He had been active in the Palestinian cause for almost 10 years
and stayed on in Gaza after participating in one of the aid
flotillas trying to break Israel’s embargo a year ago, Anna
Stevens, a colleague, said by phone from Ramallah.  Previous kidnappings in Gaza include the capture of BBC
reporter Alan Johnston in March 2007, and the abduction in
August the previous year of two Fox News journalists. Most
hostages have been freed after intervention by the  Palestinian
Authority , which governs the  West Bank .  Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organization by the
U.S. and Israel, said it had arrested two people suspected of
being “indirectly involved in the crime” and it was still
hunting for the murderers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
