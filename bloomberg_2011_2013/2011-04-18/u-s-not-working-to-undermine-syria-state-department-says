The U.S. isn’t working to undermine
the Syrian government, State Department spokesman Mark Toner
said today.  Toner responded to questions about a report that his agency
has been secretly funding opponents of President Bashar al- Assad, published in the  Washington  Post.  “We are not working to undermine that government,” Toner
said at a briefing. The programs in Syria are similar to those
the U.S. runs in other parts of the world to build democratic
institutions, Toner said. “This is part of our support for
civil society and non-governmental organizations. What’s
different is the way the Syrian government has reacted.”  A London-based satellite channel is one of the programs
funded by the State Department, a practice that began under
President  George W. Bush  and continued under President  Barack Obama , according to the Post.  To contact the reporter on this story:
