Treasury Assistant Secretary  Mary Miller  said today  Standard & Poor’s  decision to cut the long-
term U.S. credit outlook to negative “underestimates” U.S.
leadership.  “We believe S&P’s negative outlook underestimates the
ability of America’s leaders to come together to address the
difficult fiscal challenges facing the nation,” Miller said in
a statement.  S&P today affirmed its AAA/A-1+ sovereign credit rating on
the U.S., while also revising its long-term ratings outlook to
“negative” from “stable.” The ratings company said it sees a
“material risk” that U.S. policy makers might not reach an
agreement on how to address medium- and long-term budgetary
challenges by 2013.  Miller reiterated the Obama administration’s view that
budget reductions are “well within our capacity as a country.”
She said the  U.S. economy  is strengthening as it emerges from
recession and that both political parties agree on the need to
reduce the deficit.  A Treasury official told reporters in Washington that
borrowing costs are not expected to rise and that investors so
far have shown confidence in the safety, soundness and liquidity
of  U.S. debt . The official said there is momentum in the U.S. to
reduce deficits and that S&P should allow the process to work
its course.  S&P is making a political judgment about the U.S. outlook,
the official said, adding that the U.S. has in the past
outperformed S&P forecasts on unemployment and growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
