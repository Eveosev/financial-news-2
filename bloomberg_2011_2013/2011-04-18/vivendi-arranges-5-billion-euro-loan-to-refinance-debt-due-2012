Vivendi SA (VIV) , the owner of the
world’s biggest music and video-game companies, said it got 5
billion euros ($7 billion) of loans from 15 banks, some of which
will be used to refinance debt.  The transaction includes a 1.5 billion-euro loan maturing
at the end of next year, a 1.5 billion-euro three-year loan and
a 2 billion-euro five-year loan, Paris-based Vivendi said in a
statement. The five-year portion refinances a credit line of the
same size, which is due to mature in April 2012, according to
the statement.  The new financing means Vivendi will be able to access at
least 2 billion euros of undrawn credit lines after its
acquisition of 44 percent of French mobile-phone operator SFR,
according to the statement. Vivendi, whose units include the
largest video-game maker Activision Blizzard, said April 3 it
agreed to gain full control of SFR.  Vivendi has 3.2 billion euros of cash and 5.9 billion euros
of undrawn credit lines, the company said on April 4. Net debt
is forecast for 13.5 billion euros at the end of this year,
which won’t compromise its BBB rating, Vivendi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
