RWE AG (RWE)  is “solidly financed,”
Capital reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive
Officer  Juergen Grossmann .  A downgrade in the German utility’s creditworthiness by
 credit rating agencies  would be the result of political
conditions and the cost of financing wouldn’t increase
“significantly,” the German magazine cited the CEO as saying.  Grossmann still supports extending the operating lives of
Germany’s nuclear power plants after incidents at Japanese
reactors, Capital said.  Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services put RWE’s corporate
credit ratings on credit watch with negative implications on
April 8. Last week, Moody’s Investors Service placed RWE’s
senior unsecured  ratings on review for a possible downgrade,
citing “pressure on earnings and cash flows,” including
Germany’s suspension of operations at the utility’s Biblis A and
B nuclear power plants.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said on April 15 that the
country plans to exit nuclear power as quickly as possible. Last
month, she ordered the idling of the country’s seven oldest
reactors, including two operated by RWE, for a three-month
safety review after explosions at a Japanese nuclear plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
