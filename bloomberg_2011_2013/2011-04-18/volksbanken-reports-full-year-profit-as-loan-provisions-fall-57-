Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS) 
posted full-year net income of 55.4 million euros ($80 million)
after Austria’s fourth-biggest lender set aside less money to
cover bad loans.  Risk provisions declined 57 percent to 364 million euros in
2010, the Vienna-based bank said in an e-mailed statement today.
Volksbanken, which didn’t provide year-earlier profit figures in
the statement, had a loss of 1.1 billion euros in 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Volksbanken expects to achieve stable consolidated
results after taxes of more than 100 million euros in 2011 and
in subsequent years,” it said in the statement.  The lender was among the Austrian banks hit hardest by the
financial crisis and the state injected 1 billion euros of non-
voting participation capital in 2009 to help cover losses after
nationalizing the lender’s Kommunalkredit unit.  While Volksbanken has yet to pay interest on the state
capital, its largest shareholders agreed on April 15 to repay
300 million euros of the aid. The bank said it expects to “lay
the foundations” this year “for distributing dividend payments
on the participation capital held by the Republic of  Austria  as
well as on all other profit-related instruments in 2012.”  Volksbanken, which will participate in European Union bank
stress tests for the first time this year, had a Tier 1 ratio of
9.4 percent at the end of December. That compared with 8.9
percent at the end of September. Volksbanken didn’t provide a
number for its core Tier 1 ratio, the measure that will be
examined in the stress tests.  The lender is majority owned by local and regional
cooperative banks. Other investors include  Germany ’s  DZ Bank ,
 Munich Re  and Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
