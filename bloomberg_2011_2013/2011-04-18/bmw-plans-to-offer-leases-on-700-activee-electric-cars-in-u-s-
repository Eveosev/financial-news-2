Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
world’s largest luxury-vehicle maker, will offer 700 ActiveE
electric cars for lease this year in the New York area and other
U.S. markets as it introduces more fuel-efficient vehicles.  The ActiveE, based on the 1-Series Coupe, uses lithium-ion
batteries and has a range of about 100 miles, Munich-based BMW
said in a statement. The car will be offered through a 24-month
lease for $499 per month with a $2,250 down payment, BMW said.
The company will start taking reservations in August.  Testing of the ActiveE model follows BMW’s trial of the
Mini E prototype that began in 2009. Both are being tested ahead
of BMW’s i3 electric vehicle introduction slated for 2013.  The new trial vehicles "will provide further valuable
insight into everyday EV use," said Rich Steinberg, BMW’s North
America manager of the electric vehicle operations and strategy,
speaking to reporters today in  New York City .  "The ActiveE is a vitally important phase" to BMW’s
electric vehicle development, he said.  The new vehicle will be available in Boston,  Los Angeles ,
San Diego,  San Francisco , Sacramento,  California , and the New
York area, including parts of New Jersey and Connecticut, he
said.  The automaker today also showed its Z4 sDrive28i Roadster,
the first BMW with a four-cylinder engine to be sold in the U.S.
in more than a decade, the company said. The roadster will
arrive in U.S. showrooms this fall.  BMW fell 91 cents, or 1.6 percent, to 57.21 euros in
Frankfurt trading today. The shares are down 2.8 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
