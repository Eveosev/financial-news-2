Nigeria ’s inflation accelerated to
12.8 percent in March as the government stepped up spending
ahead of general elections this month.  The inflation rate climbed to 12.8 percent from 11.1
percent a month earlier, the  National Bureau of Statistics  said
today in a statement in the capital, Abuja.  The central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by one
percentage point to 7.5 percent on March 22, the second increase
this year, as it tried to stabilize the naira and slow
inflation. President  Goodluck Jonathan , a candidate in the April
16 presidential election, has committed funds to building roads,
rail lines, bridges and power plants in order to enhance growth,
adding to pressure on inflation.  Central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi said on March 22 that
the fiscal stance is “unduly expansionary.” The bank is
targeting inflation of less than 10 percent.  Nigeria’s economy, the third-biggest on the continent after
 South Africa  and  Egypt , grew 7.4 percent in the first quarter,
according to the statistics office. The economy is projected to
grow 8 percent this year, compared with 7.8 percent in 2010, the
institute says.  To contact the reporter on this story:
