Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. power generators rose for a second day as shipments to the
western  United States  increased on forecasts of lower
temperatures that may boost heating demand.  Shipments to electricity generators in the West rose 3.6
percent to 2.37 million dekatherms (2.31 billion cubic feet),
according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of 10:30 a.m. in New
York. A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments rose 1.8 percent to 12.7 million
dekatherms.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences fell 2.7 percent to
26.5 million dekatherms, the fifth consecutive decline.
Shipments have tumbled 53 percent since peaking at 56.4 million
dekatherms on Feb. 9.  High temperatures in Salt Lake City today are expected to
hit 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14.4 Celsius), 5 below normal,
according to  Weather Underground  in  Ann Arbor , Michigan. They
may rise to 59 degrees by April 21, the forecaster said.  Wholesale gas at the Northwest Pipeline Rockies hub, where
gas is delivered to Wyoming, Utah and Colorado, fell 0.74 cent,
or 0.2 percent, to $3.8033 per million British thermal units on
April 15 on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
rose 8.54 cents, or 2.1 percent, on April 15 to $4.2105 per
million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
