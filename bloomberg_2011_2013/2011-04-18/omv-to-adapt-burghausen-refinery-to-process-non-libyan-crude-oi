OMV AG (OMV) , Central Europe’s biggest
oil company, is preparing to adapt its refinery in Burghausen,
Germany, to process non-Libyan crude.  “An important part of crude oil processed in Burghausen in
2010 originated in Libya,”  Michaela Huber , a spokeswoman for
OMV, said today by e-mail from Vienna. The reconfiguration of
the refinery is taking place gradually and OMV can’t give an
exact timeframe for the process, she said.  OMV has been buying crude from  Saudi Arabia , Kazakhstan and
the Black Sea region to compensate for Libyan oil, which last
year made up 20 percent of crude processed. Saudi Aramco, the
world’s biggest oil company, sold cargoes of a new blend last
month to OMV and BP Plc, a company official said March 29.  Oil output from  Libya  has dropped by about 1.3 million
barrels a day to a “trickle” of its normal level since
fighting between government troops and rebel forces forced
companies to suspend operations and evacuate staff, the Paris-
based International Energy Agency said last month.  OMV “currently doesn’t expect a reduction in the amount of
crude oil processed compared to last year,” Huber said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
