Spain  may forgive fines to
companies regularizing so-called underground jobs,  Expansion 
reported, citing a draft written by the Labor Ministry.  Spain may cancel fines of as much as 187,000 euros
($268,831), the Madrid-based newspaper said. The government also
plans to provide timeframes for companies to pay social security
expenses of workers hired but not declared, Expansion said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
