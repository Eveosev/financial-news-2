Nigerian opposition supporters in
several northern cities burned buildings and attacked members of
President Goodluck Jonathan’s ruling party after results gave
him an election victory, police and residents said.  Results released for all 36 states showed Jonathan won 22.5
million votes and led in 21 states, compared with 12.2 million
for his closest rival, former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari of
the Congress for Progressive Change, who prevailed in 12
northern states, the electoral commission said.  Opposition supporters burned down a police station and a
church in the northern town of Kaduna, Shehu Sani, the head of
the  Civil Rights Congress , said today by phone from the city.
“At least six people were shot dead” by troops deployed to
quell the violence, he said.  Violence hit the city of Gombe for a second day and spread
to other towns, including Bauchi, Zaria, Azare and Potiskum,
Suleiman Lawal, the police spokesman in the region, said by
phone today from Gombe. Several people were killed in the
violence, including a police officer, he said, without giving
further details.  Nigeria ,  Africa ’s top oil producer and most populous
country, of more than 140 million people, is almost evenly split
between a mainly Muslim north and a predominantly Christian
south.  The divide was reflected in voting patterns, with Buhari, a
Muslim, winning in the north. Jonathan, a Christian, took the
Christian areas of the north and most of the south, including
the southwest region, which has a significant Muslim population.  To contact the reporter on this story:
