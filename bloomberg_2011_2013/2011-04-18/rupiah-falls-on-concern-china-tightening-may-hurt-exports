Indonesia ’s rupiah weakened on
concern monetary tightening in  China  will hurt the Southeast
Asian nation’s exports. Benchmark bonds fell for a third day.  The currency traded near its lowest level in a week after
the People’s Bank of China said yesterday it will increase
banks’ reserve requirements by 50 basis points from April 21 to
tackle the fastest inflation in 32 months. China was Indonesia’s
third-largest non-oil export market in February after  Japan  and
the U.S., official data show.  “China’s tightening may lead to slower growth and that
would affect Indonesia’s exports to the country,” said
Lindawati Susanto, head of treasury at PT Bank Resona Perdania
in Jakarta. “I think the rupiah will trade from 8,660 to 8,690
today.”  The rupiah declined 0.1 percent to 8,673 per dollar as of
4:19 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It reached 8,688 late on April 14 and 15, the weakest level
since April 4. The currency has advanced 3.5 percent this year
and touched a seven-year high of 8,637 on April 11.  Consumer prices in China gained 5.4 percent in March,
compared with a 4.9 percent increase in February, according to
official figures released April 15. China’s central bank
Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  said over the weekend that policy makers
will continue monetary tightening for “some time.”  Indonesia’s 10-year government bonds declined. The yield on
the 8.25 percent note climbed 7 basis points to 7.85 percent,
according to closing prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporters on this story:
