Barclays Plc (BARC) , Britain’s third-
largest bank, said ex-Finance Director Naguib Kheraj will rejoin
as a senior adviser to Chief Executive Officer  Robert Diamond .  Kheraj, 46, will advise Finance Director Chris Lucas on
“commercial and policy matters,” London-based Barclays said
today in a  statement  on its website. He will spend about a third
of his time in the role of vice chairman, the bank said.  “He made a significant contribution as a member to the
management team, and we valued his insight immensely as an
external adviser,” Diamond said in the statement.  Kheraj, who joined Barclays in 1997, left in 2007, the same
year he served as an adviser on the bank’s failed bid for ABN
Amro Holding NV of the Netherlands. Kheraj stepped down as CEO
of Lazard International in February after less than two months
in the job to focus on his philanthropic activities with the Aga
Khan Development Network, he said at the time.
