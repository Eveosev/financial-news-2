House Majority Leader Eric Cantor
said the decision by  Standard & Poor’s  to put a “negative”
outlook on the U.S. AAA credit rating is a “wakeup call” and
shows the need for “serious reforms” to ensure the nation’s
fiscal health.  The negative outlook issued by S&P “makes clear that the
debt-limit increase proposed by the Obama administration must be
accompanied by meaningful fiscal reforms that immediately reduce
federal spending and stop our nation from digging itself further
into debt,” the Virginia Republican said in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
