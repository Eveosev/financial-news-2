Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip
Erdogan  said he sees the Peace and Democracy Party, the
country’s main Kurdish party, as his party’s sole rival in
parliamentary elections in the southeast, Milliyet reported.  The ruling  Justice and Development Party  has selected
prominent locals as its candidates in the mainly-Kurdish
southeast for the June 12 elections, Erdogan told the Istanbul-
based newspaper in an interview. There’s "no question of
ignoring the southeast" and only two parties stand a chance of
election there, he said.  He said Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek had been moved from
his Gaziantep constituency to campaign in the city of Batman,
closer to the village where he was born.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
