Jupiter Fund Management Plc (JUP) , the
British  fund manager  that went public in June, said assets under
management rose 1.6 percent in the first quarter on higher
inflows into  mutual funds .  Jupiter oversaw 24.5 billion pounds ($40 billion) at March
31 compared with 24.1 billion pounds at the end of 2010, the
London-based firm said today in a statement.  “Against a backdrop of volatile markets and falling U.K.
consumer disposable income, Jupiter has had a steady start to
2011,” Chief Executive Officer Edward Bonham Carter said in the
statement.  Inflows into mutual funds, which make up three-quarters of
Jupiter’s assets, contributed more than any other product to the
increase in assets under management, reaching 397 million pounds
in the first quarter. Adjusting for market movements, Jupiter’s
net inflows were 333 million pounds, the lowest quarterly rise
since the second three months of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
