The  New York Yankees  beat the Texas
Rangers 6-5 as Eric Chavez drove in the winning run in the
eighth inning in place of the injured  Alex Rodriguez .  The Yankees won the final two games of the Major League
Baseball series between American League division leaders after
dropping the opener at Yankee Stadium.  Russell Martin, Curtis Granderson and Robinson Cano hit
home runs for the Yankees (9-5), giving them a franchise-record
27 homers through their first 14 games this season, according to
the Elias Sports Bureau. They surpassed the previous record of
25 set by the 1932 team led by  Babe Ruth  and Lou Gehrig.  Chavez, starting at third base as Rodriguez sat out with a
rib injury, singled in the go-ahead run in the bottom of the
eighth inning to snap a 5-5 tie.  The Rangers (10-5) have lost four of five games since
opening the season 9-1 and slipped into a tie with the Los
Angeles Angels atop the AL Western Division. The Angels have a
MLB-best five-game winning streak after beating the Chicago
White Sox 4-2 yesterday.  The  New York Mets  halted a seven-game losing skid by
beating the Atlanta Braves 3-2 yesterday in the finale of a
three-game series in Atlanta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
