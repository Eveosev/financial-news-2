Seaborne trade in crude oil will
decline 1.3 percent this year, led by shrinking supplies from
the Persian Gulf, according to Maritime Strategies International
Ltd., a London-based freight forecaster.  Imports to the U.S., the world’s largest buyer of overseas
crudes, are being curbed by rising domestic  oil production ,
Maritime Strategies said in a Feb. 11 report. Rates for the
largest tankers won’t significantly recover from a slump unless
there’s “much more scrapping,” the forecaster said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
