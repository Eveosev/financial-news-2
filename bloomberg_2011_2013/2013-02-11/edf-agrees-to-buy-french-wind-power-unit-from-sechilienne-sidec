Sechilienne-Sidec agreed to sell its
wind-power business including six French farms to EDF Energies
Nouvelles SA for 59 million euros ($79 million).  EDF Energies, a unit of Electricite de France SA, agreed to
pay a further sum for five plants being developed, Courbevoie-
based Sechilienne said today in a statement. The current farms
have total capacity of 56.5 megawatts. EDF said in a separate
statement it agreed the deal to boost French wind operations.  Sechilienne will use the proceeds to focus on generating
power from biomass and solar in France and abroad, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
