Tofas Turk Otomobil Fabrikasi AS 
headed for the biggest gain in almost three weeks after the
joint venture of  Fiat SpA  and Turkey’s  Koc Holding AS  unveiled
plans for two new car models.  The shares rose 1.9 percent, the most on a closing basis
since Jan. 24, to 10.55 liras at 4:07 p.m in Istanbul. The
benchmark index fell 1.1 percent.  Tofas in July will disclose details of two models set to go
on sale after 2015, which may carry the company to full
production of 400,000 vehicles a year, Chief Executive Officer
Kamil Basaran told a news conference Feb. 8. The joint venture
also plans to sell its “Doblo” van in the U.S. starting from
the end of next year, Basaran said.  “There was previous mention of a new model, but this is
the first time a time frame is mentioned,” Esra Suner, vice
president of research at Is Investment in Istanbul, said by
phone today. The models should have a positive effect on the
stock over the long term, she said.  Tofas was also raised to overweight from neutral at HSBC by
analyst  Cenk Orcan  today, raising the price target to 12.7 liras
from 10.1 liras, according to  data compiled by Bloomberg . Eleven
analysts have a buy rating on the stock, 15 say hold and one
recommends selling it, the data show.  The automaker has a 13.2 percent domestic market share with
the Fiat brand as of the end of 2012, according to a
presentation on its website. The “Linea” model is the best-
selling sedan in Turkey, while “Doblo” is the best-selling
light commercial vehicle, the company says in the presentation.  Tofas reported 2012 net income of 448.3 million liras
($252.6 million) after markets closed on Feb. 6, above the 445.6
million liras average estimate of 21 analysts on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
