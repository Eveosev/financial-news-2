Copper fell on speculation that
slowing industrial production from Europe to the U.S. may curb
demand and as inventories tracked by the London Metal Exchange
reached the highest level since November 2011.  Copper for three-month delivery fell as much as 0.2 percent
to $8,280 a metric ton on the LME and traded at $8,286 at 11:33
a.m. in Singapore. The metal for delivery in March gained 0.2
percent to $3.765 a pound on the Comex in New York. Markets in
China, the biggest consumer, are closed this week for the Lunar
New Year holiday.  Industrial production in France, Europe’s second-largest
economy, probably declined 0.2 percent in December from the
previous month, when it rose 0.5 percent, according to the
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg before data
today. Industrial production in the U.S. may have risen 0.2
percent in January from a 0.3 percent gain in a month earlier,
data may show this week.  “As the industrial production numbers come out for
December and January, if they continue to be weak then that
would be another reason for the price not to escalate,” said
 David Lennox , an analyst at Fat Prophets in Sydney. Higher
stockpiles may also constrain prices, he said by phone today.  LME copper stockpiles climbed 6.3 percent to 399,825 tons
last week, the highest since November 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Zinc was little changed at $2,206 a ton
after reaching $2,218 on Feb. 8, the most expensive since Jan.
26, 2012. LME inventories dropped for a third week last week to
the lowest since November, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Aluminum rose 0.2 percent to $2,123 a ton, lead gained 0.4
percent to $2,430 a ton and nickel advanced 0.4 percent to
$18,391 a ton.  To contact the reporter for this story:
