Masisa SA , a Chilean wood panels
manufacturer that gets a quarter of its revenue from Venezuela,
tumbled the most in three months on speculation that a
devaluation of the country’s currency will crimp profits.  Masisa fell 3.3 percent to 54.5 pesos at 1:33 p.m. in
Santiago trading after earlier falling as much as 4.2 percent in
the biggest intraday loss since Oct. 19. It was the biggest
decliner today on the  Chile 65 stock-market index , which tracks
the country’s largest companies based on an adjusted measure of
market value.  Venezuela’s finance minister said Feb. 8 the government
would weaken the official exchange rate by 32 percent to 6.3
bolivars per dollar. The country accounted for 25 percent of
Santiago-based Masisa’s revenue during the first nine months of
2012, according to regulatory filings.  “They will have a lot of revenue in bolivars and to bring
that back in dollars will cost more,”  Jose Manuel Edwards , an
analyst at Santiago-based broker IM Trust SA, said in a
telephone interview.  Masisa operates 38 Placacentro construction-material stores
in Venezuela, according to the company’s website. Masisa also
has an industrial facility and owns 84,800 hectares of forests
in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
