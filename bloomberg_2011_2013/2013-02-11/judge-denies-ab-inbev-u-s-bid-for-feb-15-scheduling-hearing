Anheuser-Busch InBev NV  and the U.S.
lost a bid for a Feb. 15 scheduling hearing in the government’s
lawsuit to block the brewer’s $20.1 billion takeover of Grupo
Modelo SAB because other parties have asked to enter the case.  U.S. District Judge  Richard Roberts  today said requests by
 Constellation Brands Inc.  and Crown Imports LLC, which imports
Modelo’s brands in the U.S., to intervene in the suit haven’t
received a response from the government.  “Because two additional entities have filed a motion to
intervene to which the plaintiff has not yet responded, and the
defendants have not yet responded to the complaint, it is hereby
ordered that the joint motion for a scheduling conference be,
and hereby is, denied,” Roberts wrote.  Roberts hasn’t ruled on the requests by Constellation and
Crown to enter the proceedings.  The case is U.S. v. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, 13-cv-
00127, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
