Fulcrum Asset Management LLP, the
$1.4 billion computer-driven hedge fund group founded by former
British Broadcasting Corp. Chairman Gavyn Davies, made  Andrew Bevan  and  Mohammed Fawaz  partners.  Bevan, director of research, and Fawaz, a portfolio
manager, were made partners on Jan. 1, according to Companies
House records. Bevan, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. managing
director, joined Fulcrum in 2006. Fawaz has been with the
London-based hedge fund since 2005.  They join Davies, co-founder  Andrew Stevens , Chief
Investment Officer  Suhail Shaikh , North American President Tom
Dempsey, Chief Operating Officer Joe Davidson and Jeremy Bedford
as partners, according to the company’s website. An official at
Fulcrum declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News on
Feb. 8, asking not to be identified in line with company policy.  Fulcrum Alpha , the company’s flagship fund, returned 1
percent net of fees in 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, beating the 3.4 percent decline in the Newedge CTA
Trend Sub-Index, which tracks the performance of the largest
computer-driven, or quant, funds. Alpha lost 8.9 percent the
previous year and has returned 31 percent since its inception in
2006, compared with a 16 percent increase in the Newedge index.  James Horrocks, the company’s former head trader, resigned
on Dec. 31 for personal reasons, Stevens said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
