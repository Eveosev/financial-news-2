Xylem Inc ., whose pumps helped clean
New York tunnels of floodwaters after Hurricane Sandy, won a
contract for marine-monitoring buoys to collect data for
researchers studying climate change in the Caribbean Sea.  The solar-powered buoys off Barbados, Belize, the Dominican
Republic, St. Lucia and Trinidad & Tobago will employ technology
to monitor water quality to seek ways to protect coral reefs in
the Caribbean, Chris McIntire, president of Xylem Analytics,
said in today’s statement. Xylem’s award from the Caribbean
Community Climate Change Centre is for $617,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
