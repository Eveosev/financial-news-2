South African Airways, Africa's 
biggest airline, said it has suspended  Vuyisile Kona , its
acting chief executive officer, because of allegations it didn’t
describe.  “This is based on certain allegations that have come to
the attention of the board,” the state-owned company said in an 
e-mailed statement yesterday. “The board has a
fiduciary duty to investigate.”  The state-owned company is seeking a new CEO and expects to 
make an appointment by March 31, it said.  Nico Bezuidenhout , the CEO of
SAA’s Mango unit, will oversee the company in the interim.  Bezuidenhout becomes the third person at the helm of the
unprofitable airline in four months. Siza Mzimela resigned in
October and Kona, who was chairman at the time, was named acting
CEO. The change in management might hamper the finalization of a
rescue plan requested by the state.  “We are lagging behind for the turnaround strategy,” said
Natasha Michaels, shadow minister of Public Enterprises for the
opposition Democratic Alliance, in a phone interview today.
“The worry is that Bezuidenhout is acting CEO and we don’t know
if he will be around to implement the strategy or his own
ideas.”  The airline, Africa’s largest, posted a pretax loss of 1.36
billion rand for fiscal 2012 compared with a profit of 792
million rand a year earlier, according to its  annual report . The
airline was given a 5-billion rand ($560 million) guarantee by
the government on Oct. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
