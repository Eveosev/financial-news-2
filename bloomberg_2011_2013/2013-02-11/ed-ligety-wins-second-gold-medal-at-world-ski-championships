American  Ted Ligety  won the men’s
super combined for his second gold medal of the skiing world
championships as two-time defending title holder  Aksel Lund Svindal  failed to complete the course.  Ligety was in sixth after the downhill, the first leg of
the event. His time of 54.86 seconds on the slalom put him 1.15
seconds ahead of Croatia’s  Ivica Kostelic . Austria’s Romed
Baumann, the leader after the downhill, held on for the bronze
medal in Schladming, Austria.  “It’s pretty sweet,” Ligety said. “It’s crazy. It’s
definitely a surprise. It’s an event I always thought I had a
chance in, but never had it come together.”  Ligety won his first world super-G title Feb. 6 when
Norway’s Svindal, the pre-race favorite, made a mistake two
turns from the finish. Today Svindal straddled a gate halfway
down the course and failed to finish.  “It was a classic slalom mistake,” Svindal said. “It
happens.”  Svindal, who won a gold in the downhill, said he had a
muscle strain and couldn’t start aggressively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
