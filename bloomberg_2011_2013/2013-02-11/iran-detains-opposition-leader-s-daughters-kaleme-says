Iran’s security forces detained
two daughters of Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi,
the Kaleme website said. The judiciary said they were only
summoned for questioning and aren’t under arrest.  Kaleme , an opposition website, said security forces
detained Zahra and Narges Mousavi after raiding their home this
morning and searching it for several hours.  The judiciary spokesman’s office said they were “summoned
to provide some explanations and will be able to return home in
the next hour.”  The two women released a statement earlier this year
calling for the freeing of their parents, who they said were
held against their “legal and human” rights, Kaleme  reported 
on Jan. 7. The letter was co-signed by the children of Mehdi
Karrubi, another opposition leader. The women haven’t met with
their parents for more than three months, Kaleme said today.  Mousavi and Karrubi ran in the 2009 election against
President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  and lost amid fraud allegations
that sparked street protests.  Mousavi, a former prime minister has been under  house
arrest  along with his wife, Zahra Rahnavard, for nearly two
years. Karrubi, a former parliamentary speaker, has had a
similar fate. Iranian authorities accuse them of being backed by
foreign powers and attempting to undermine the Islamic Republic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
