Japanese stock futures rose and the
yen weakened after Haruhiko Kuroda, a potential contender for
Bank of Japan chief, said additional monetary easing can be
justified this year. Australian shares rose.  American Depositary Receipts of Canon Inc., Japan’s largest
camera maker that gets 80 percent of sales abroad, gained 2.6
percent as the yen touched the lowest level since May 2010. ADRs
of Nissan Motor Co. sank 3.5 percent after Japan’s second-
biggest carmaker reported third-quarter profit that fell short
of analyst estimates, with sales dropping in China. Amcom
Telecommunications Ltd. gained 1.7 percent in Sydney after the
fiber-optics carrier maintained its profit forecast.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring next
month closed at 11,470 in Chicago yesterday, up from 11,170 at
the most recent close in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-
market at 11,390 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s
 S&P/ASX 200 Index  gained 0.3 percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index rose 0.1 percent.  “If we do see a BOJ Governor of Kuroda’s calibre, the
dollar-yen could well punch through 95 and would head to 100
very quickly,” said  Evan Lucas , Melbourne-based market
strategist at IG Markets Ltd., a provider of trading services.
“It would also signal to Japanese consumers and investors alike
that the government is finally taking action.”  Japan, Korea  Japan and South Korea equity markets reopen after
yesterday’s holiday, while markets in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan,
Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia remain shut.  Gains in futures contracts indicate the Nikkei 225 Stock
Average will recoup some of last week’s first decline in 13
weeks, which snapped its longest streak of weekly wins since
1959. The yen today weakened to 94.46 per dollar, its lowest
level since May 2010.  The BOJ could usher in a growth spurt unseen in a
generation by stepping up stimulus and ending deflation,
according to Kuroda, head of the Asian Development Bank and a
potential contender for BOJ chief. Kuroda, who said he was
“satisfied” with his current job amid Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe’s preparations for unveiling a nominee to succeed Masaaki
Shirakawa, said that additional BOJ stimulus could be justified
for 2013.  The BOJ last month said it would start open-ended asset
purchases only in January 2014, and the board is forecast to
keep its policy unchanged at a Feb. 13-14 gathering, according
to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  were little
changed. The S&P 500 dropped 0.1 percent yesterday after a six-
week rally left the gauge trading at its most expensive
valuation since July 2011.  The S&P 500 has rallied 6.4 percent in 2013 to its highest
level since November 2007 as U.S. lawmakers reached a budget
compromise and companies reported better-than-estimated
earnings. That’s more than double the MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s
gain of 2.4 percent this year through yesterday.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, traded at 14.7 times average estimated earnings
compared with 13.7 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and a
multiple of 12.2 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Of the 288 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific index that
have reported  earnings  so far this quarter and for which
Bloomberg has estimates, 53 percent have exceeded profit
expectations. Some 53 percent have missed sales projections.
That compares with 74 percent of S&P 500 companies that topped
profit forecasts during the period, while 33 percent fell short
of sales estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. dropped 0.6 percent to 96.16 in New
York yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
