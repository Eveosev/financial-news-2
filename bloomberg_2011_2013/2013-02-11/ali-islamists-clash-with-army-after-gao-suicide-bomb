Islamist insurgents from the
Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa battled Malian
troops in the northern city of Gao after a second suicide
bombing in two days.  “There were violent clashes between the Malian army and
its allies and Islamists from Mujao,” Astor Bilal, an adviser
to the mayor of Gao, said by phone today. The fighting happened
yesterday for about four hours until the troops regained control
and calm returned around 9 p.m., he said.  The attacks came after a suicide bomb attack late on Feb.
9, the second in two days, Bilal said. The insurgents entered
Gao, one of the last cities where fighting is continuing a month
after French airstrikes started a battle to regain control of
two-thirds of Mali held by rebels.  France intervened in Mali to help it restore state control
over a nation that vies with Tanzania as Africa’s third-biggest
gold producer. Some of its 4,000 troops may start withdrawing in
a few weeks as an African Union-backed regional force prepares
to take over and hold key areas, French Defense Minister  Jean- Yves Le Drian  said on Feb. 6.  Ghana began airlifting 120 army engineers to Mali as its
contribution to the mission, Nbawine Atintande, spokesman for
the military, said by phone today. Burkina Faso, Chad, Togo,
Benin, Nigeria and Guinea are among the countries sending
soldiers to Mali.  To contact the reporter on this story:
