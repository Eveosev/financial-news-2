Latvian support for adopting the
euro rose 2 percent on the month to 33 percent in January, the
pollster TNS said in an e-mailed statement today.  The survey showed that 63 percent of respondents oppose
joining the euro, down from 66 percent in the December poll,
while percentage of undecided voters increased to 4 percent from
3 percent.  The poll surveyed 1,012 people from Jan. 9-28, and didnâ€™t
show a margin of error. The Baltic country is trying to meet the
criteria to adopt the euro next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
