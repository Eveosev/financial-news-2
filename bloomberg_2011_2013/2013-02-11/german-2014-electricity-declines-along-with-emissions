German power for 2014, a benchmark
for European electricity prices, fell as the cost of emission
permits declined from a two-week high.  German baseload power, for delivery around the clock, fell
as much as 27 cents to 42.03 euros ($56.38) a megawatt-hour and
traded at 42.23 euros as of 5:30 p.m. in Berlin. European carbon
allowances for December dropped 7 cents to 4.47 euros a metric
ton after earlier sliding to 4.22 euros on London’s ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Power can track emissions and other fuels that
influence production costs.  “We reiterate our negative view on the German power price
due to worsening oversupply from negative demand growth,
renewables and the collapsing emissions market, which would
imply a carbon price of zero absent political intervention,”
 Per Lekander , a Paris-based analyst at  UBS AG , said today in an
e-mail.  In France, baseload power for March fell as much as 3.6
percent to a record 43.15 euros amid forecasts of milder-than-
average weather. The maximum temperature in Paris will rise to
12 degrees Celsius (54 Fahrenheit) on Feb. 16, compared with
today’s temperature and seasonal median of 9 degrees, according
to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.  French nuclear generation was little changed today as two
reactors halted and two started, according to data from grid
operator  Reseau de Transport d’Electricite . The 1,335-megawatt
St. Alban-2 and 1,310-megawatt Nogent-2 units are back online,
while the 880-megawatt reactor Bugey-5 was halted Feb. 9 for
maintenance and the 1,300-megawatt unit Cattenom-4 stopped on
Feb. 8, RTE said on its website.  German Generation  In Germany, power generation availability will advance to
64,900 megawatts on Feb. 21 from 62,000 megawatts today,
according to the  transparency website  of European Energy
Exchange AG.  EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG ’s nuclear plant unit
 Philippsburg 2  came back online on Friday after a 522-megawatt
reduction of power output that lasted “several hours,” Ulrich
Schroeder, a company spokesman said via phone from Karlsruhe
today. On Feb. 14, EON AG will take its 550-megawatt gas-fired
plant Irsching 4 offline for maintenance until Feb. 18, the
company said on its  transparency website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
