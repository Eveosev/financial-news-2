Here are some highlights of Pope
Benedict XVI’s papacy.  *April 19, 2005:  Joseph Ratzinger  is elected the 265th
pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church and chooses the name
Benedict XVI. He replaces  Pope John Paul II , who died April 2.  *April 24, 2005: The pope celebrates his Papal inauguration
mass in St. Peter square.  *Dec. 25, 2005: He signs his first encyclical letter “Deus
caritas est” in which he points to Jesus Christ’s death on the
cross as love in its most radical form.  *June 22, 2006: He names Cardinal  Tarcisio Bertone 
secretary of state.  *Sept. 12, 2006: His lecture at Germany’s University of
Regensburg, in which he quotes a 14th-century Byzantine emperor
who called Islam “evil and inhuman,” sparks criticism and
violent protests in Muslim countries that force him to make
several public apologies.  *Jan. 15, 2008: A visit to Rome’s La Sapienza University
planned for Jan. 17 is called off amid protests by students and
professors who accuse the pope of being “hostile” to science.  *April 15-21, 2008: During his visit to the U.S., he is
received at the White House on his 81st birthday, meets with
sex-abuse victims from the Boston Archdiocese, addresses the
United Nations General Assembly, visits Ground Zero, and
celebrates Mass at Nationals Park and Yankee Stadium. In a
speech to bishops April 16, he says the Church “very badly
handled” the scandal involving pedophile priests and told U.S.
bishops it is crucial to protect children from sexual predators.  Holocaust  *Jan. 24, 2009: He lifts the excommunication of Bishop
Richard Williamson and three other priests who broke with the
Church in the 1980s, days after Williamson denied the Nazi
Holocaust. The Vatican’s delay in distancing itself from
Williamson and denouncing his views drew the ire of leaders
including German Chancellor  Angela Merkel .  *May 8-15, 2009: He visits Jordan, Israel and the
Palestinian Territories, where he condemns Holocaust denials and
calls for cooperation between Palestinians and Israelis.  *March 20, 2010: In a letter to victims of child sex abuse
in Ireland he apologizes for the “grave errors” of leadership
that were committed by Catholic authorities in the country after
scandals involving priests.  *April 12, 2010: The Vatican publishes for the first time
its guidelines for dealing with Roman Catholic clerics accused
of molesting minors.  *Nov. 2010: An interview of the Pope by a German reporter
triggers confusion over the Church’s view on the use of condoms.  *March 24, 2012: He begins a weeklong visit to Latin
America denouncing the drug war that has racked Mexico and
calling on Cuba’s leadership to find alternatives to marxism.  Butler Arrest  *Oct. 6, 2012: A Vatican court finds Benedict’s former
butler Paolo Gabriele guilty of stealing sensitive documents and
sentences him to 18 months in prison.  *Dec. 12, 2012: He blesses hundreds of thousands of
followers in his first twitter message.  *Dec. 22, 2012: He pardons his former butler, allowing him
to be released from prison.  *Feb. 11, 2013: Benedict XVI announces he will resign,
effective Feb. 28, due to advancing age and health reasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
