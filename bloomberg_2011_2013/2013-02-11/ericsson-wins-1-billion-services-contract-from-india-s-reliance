Ericsson AB , the world’s largest
maker of wireless networks, won a $1 billion contract to manage
the systems of Indian phone operator Reliance Communications
Ltd., expanding its services business in Asia.  About 5,000 Reliance  employees  will transfer to Ericsson as
part of the eight-year contract, according to a statement today
from the Stockholm-based company. Ericsson will operate and
manage Reliance’s wireline and wireless networks in the northern
and western states of India.  Ericsson  is trying to sell more services such as network
management and maintenance as wireless operators in Europe curb
infrastructure investment amid contracting economies and
increasing competition. Last year, Ericsson’s services revenue
expanded 16 percent as network-equipment sales fell 11 percent.  Reliance, which awarded a $1 billion services contract to
French phone-equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent SA last month, is
signing such deals to reduce the cost of running its networks.
Network costs will probably drop 8 percent to 10 percent this
year, helped by outsourcing deals, Gurdeep Singh, the head of
Reliance’s wireless business, said Jan. 24. Network costs last
fiscal year totaled $1.3 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Shares of Ericsson  rose  0.7 percent to 78.10 kronor at
10:02 a.m. in Stockholm. Reliance, India’s third-largest mobile-
phone company by subscribers, advanced 0.5 percent to 75.6
rupees in Mumbai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
