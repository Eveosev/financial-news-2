James Tisch , the chief executive
officer of Loews Corp., said gains in the world’s largest
economy may be sluggish again this year.  Economic conditions in the U.S. have been “challenging,
with the pace of recovery sluggish and intermittent,” Tisch
said today in a conference call held by the New York-based
company. “We expect more of the same for 2013.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
