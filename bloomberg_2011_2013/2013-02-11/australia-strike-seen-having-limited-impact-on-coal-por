A 48-hour strike by train drivers in
Australia, which hindered coal shipments by rail to the port of
Newcastle, had a “minimal impact” on the export facility, said
Gulf Agency Co., a port agent.  Stockpiles at the facility declined as 600,000 metric tons
weren’t delivered because of the strike, GAC said in a notice on
its website today. While there’s no indication of further
industrial action, the dispute hasn’t been settled, GAC said.  The stoppage ended yesterday, according to the port agent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
