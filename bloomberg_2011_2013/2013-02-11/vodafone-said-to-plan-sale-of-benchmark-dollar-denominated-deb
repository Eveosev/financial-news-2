Vodafone Group Plc  sold $6 billion
of bonds in a five-part transaction in the U.S., the largest
dollar-denominated issue in more than three weeks.  The mobile telephone company’s $900 million of 0.9 percent,
three-year fixed-rate debt yields 55 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and $700 million of three-year
floating-rate bonds yield 38.5 basis points more than the three-
month London interbank offered rate, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Its $1.4 billion of 1.5 percent, five-year notes
have a relative yield of 75 basis points, $1.6 billion of 2.95
percent, 10-year securities have a spread of 105 basis points
and $1.4 billion of 4.375 percent, 30-year debt has a spread of
130 basis points.  Vodafone last sold debt in September, issuing $1 billion
each of 1.25 percent, five-year debentures at a spread of 62.5
basis points and 2.5 percent, 10-year debentures at 87.5 basis
points, Bloomberg data show. The bonds due September 2022 traded
at 97.8 cents on the dollar to yield 2.77 percent on Feb. 7,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The new bonds from the Newbury, England-based company are
expected to be rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service and
proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, Bloomberg
data show.  Barclays Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley managed
the offering, the data show.  The sale is the largest offering in the U.S. since JPMorgan
Chase & Co. issued $6 billion of bonds in three parts on Jan.
17, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
