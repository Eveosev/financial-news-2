Consumers’ Co-Operative Refineries
Ltd. shut a coker at its  Regina refinery  in Saskatchewan,
Canada, after a fire, according to Daryl Oshanek, a company
spokesman.  The fire, which broke out at about 12:30 a.m. in the coker
at the heavy oil upgrader section of the plant, came as the
refinery was planning to start units that were shut after an
October 2011 explosion and fire. The blaze was put out by
refinery personnel, according to the Regina fire department.  The company was unaware if the fire was related to the
restart of these units, according to Oshanek, who is based in
Saskatoon. Consumers plans to host a press conference at 1:30
p.m. local time, he said.  In October, Consumers completed an expansion that increased
Regina’s capacity by about 45,000 barrels a day to 145,000
barrels a day, making it Canada’s fourth-largest refinery, the
company said. The project allows the plant to process more light
synthetic crude oil.  The October 2011 explosion damaged a middle distillate and
light naphtha unifiner, along with a gasoline isomerization
unit. Those units were expected to restart late this month,
Oshanek said in an e-mail Feb. 7. The company initially expected
the units to start in November.  There were no injuries in today’s fire and Consumers plans
to host a press conference at 1:30 p.m. local time, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
