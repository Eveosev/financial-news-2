Chile’s central bank plans to swap
$507 million of new inflation-linked securities for old zero-
coupon and amortizing debt as part of a plan to boost liquidity
in its benchmark bond curve.  The bank will offer five-year indexed debt in exchange for
amortizing inflation-linked bonds known as PRCs and zero-coupon
securities called CEROs that were sold between 2000 and 2002,
according to a statement on its website. The bank said it last
offered a similar swap in the fourth quarter of 2010.  “They have done this before in response to an old
recommendation of the International Monetary Fund, but the
holders of the PRCs and the CEROs didn’t think it was very
attractive” said Felipe Alarcon, an economist at Banco de
Credito & Inversiones in Santiago who previously ran a markets
desk at the central bank. “There aren’t very many PRCs and
CEROs still around, but the idea is to make the benchmark curve
more liquid.”  The swap offer will run from March 9 through May 8,
according to the statement. The  yield  on five-year inflation
bonds was little changed at 2.77 percent today.  Chile’s peso fell as copper declined on concern the
sovereign debt crisis in the euro-area will slow growth and curb
demand for metals. The currency slid 0.1 percent to 472.69 per
U.S. dollar as of 12:16 p.m. in Santiago. Copper for March
delivery fell 1.1 percent to $3.7205 a pound.  The peso has closed between 472 and 473 per dollar in the
last four sessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
