Mol Nyrt. , Hungary’s biggest
refiner, rebounded from its steepest slump in more than 15
months.  Mol’s shares rose as much as 1.8 percent and traded 0.5
percent higher at 17,685 forint by the end of trading in
Budapest. The volume was 134 percent of the stock’s three-month
daily average. The benchmark BUX stock index, in which Mol has
the second-biggest  weighting  at 31 percent, advanced 0.2
percent.  Mol dropped 5 percent on Feb. 8 after  Dana Gas PJSC  sold
1.675 million shares in the refiner to help refinance its Sukuk
debt. The transaction, which Bloomberg News first reported on
Feb. 7, was confirmed by Dana in a  statement  yesterday.  “A near-term correction in the share price is quite likely
after similar events,”  Peter Csaszar , a Warsaw-based analyst at
KBC Groep NV, wrote in a research report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
