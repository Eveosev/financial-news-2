Genworth Financial Inc. , the seller
of life insurance and long-term care coverage, gained in New
York trading after Reuters reported the insurer is in
negotiations to sell a wealth-management unit.  Genworth  advanced  2.6 percent to $9.04 at 10:58 a.m. in New
York, reversing an earlier decline.  Genworth is in talks with private equity firms Genstar
Capital and Aquiline Capital Partners, Reuters reported, citing
two sources it didn’t identify. A deal for the wealth management
unit and the alternative investments business may be valued at
$400 million to $450 million, Reuters said.  Al Orendorff , a spokesman for Richmond, Virginia-based
Genworth, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Chief
Financial Officer  Martin Klein  said in October that Genworth was
preparing the wealth-management business for a sale as part of a
strategic review. Representatives of Genstar and Aquiline didn’t
immediately return requests for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
