Global solar-power capacity rose to
at least 101 gigawatts last year as growth in China, the U.S.
and Japan outstripped some markets in Europe.  About 30 to 32 gigawatts were completed worldwide, compared
with almost 30 gigawatts in 2011, the  European Photovoltaic
Industry Association  said today in an e-mailed statement. Solar
photovoltaic plants can now generate as much electricity as
about 16 mid-sized nuclear power stations, the lobby group said.  Governments from India to Chile are promoting sun-based
power to satisfy growing energy demand while meeting emission
targets. Global installations expanded last year after an
equipment glut drove down solar-panel prices, even as European
markets slowed following a reduction in state subsidies.  “No one would have predicted even 10 years ago that we
would see more than 100 gigawatts of photovoltaic capacity in
the world by 2012,” EPIA President  Winfred Hoffman  said in the
statement. “The industry clearly faces challenges but the
results of 2012 show there is a strong global market.”  Countries outside Europe added more than 13 gigawatts of
solar capacity last year, compared with less than 8 gigawatts in
2011, driven by China, the U.S. and Japan, the data show.
Germany, home to a third of the world’s solar panels, remained
the biggest market after adding 7.6 gigawatts, while Europe as a
whole installed 17 gigawatts, down from 23 gigawatts.  Global Wind Energy Council  data  show that wind-power growth
also accelerated last year, with capacity reaching 282.5
gigawatts worldwide after 44.7 gigawatts were completed in the
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
