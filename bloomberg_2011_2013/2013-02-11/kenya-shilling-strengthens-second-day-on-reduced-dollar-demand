Kenya’s shilling gained for a second
day on reduced dollar demand by businesses and as the central
bank continued to remove money from the market.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy gained as
much as 0.9 percent to 86.80 per dollar and was trading less
than 0.1 percent stronger at 87.55 per dollar by 3:02 p.m. in
Nairobi, the capital.  “There is marginal trading today with minimal demand for
dollars from businesses as we go into the middle of the month,
this has allowed the shilling to remain stable,” John Muli, a
dealer at Nairobi-based African Banking Corp., said by phone.
“The continual removal of liquidity from the market by the
central bank is offering support to the shilling.”  The Central Bank of Kenya accepted 1.7 billion shillings
($19.4 million) out of 3.2 billion shillings in bids for seven-
day repurchase agreements, an official, who asked not to be
identified in line with policy, said by phone from Nairobi. The
bank had offered 2 billion shillings. The bank uses the repos to
reduce total money supply and support the shilling.  Uganda’s currency weakened less than 0.1 percent to
2,649.50 per dollar, while the Tanzanian shilling depreciated
0.1 percent to 1,617 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
