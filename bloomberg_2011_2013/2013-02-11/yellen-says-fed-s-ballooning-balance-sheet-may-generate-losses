Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Janet
Yellen said the central bank’s balance sheet may incur losses
that would wipe out the Fed’s remittances to the U.S. Treasury.  “There is a chance that we could go through a period of
time in which our income falls, and we could even take losses,”
Yellen said in response to audience questions after a speech in
Washington. “We’ve been paying enormous sums to the Treasury”
from income on the Fed’s holdings, and “it is possible” that
there will be “a period of a year, or even several years, in
which those remittances fall to zero.”  The central bank’s balance sheet, which has ballooned to a
record of more than $3 trillion through three asset-purchase
programs, has provided unprecedented windfalls to the U.S.
Treasury. The Fed uses interest income from its bond holdings to
cover its own expenses and sends the rest to the Treasury. In
2012, that dividend to taxpayers was $88.9 billion.  Yellen said that the Fed’s policies are helpful to the
nation’s finances by creating jobs and lowering long-term
interest rates.  “This is a policy that is not only good for output and the
economy, but also for the federal finances overall,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
