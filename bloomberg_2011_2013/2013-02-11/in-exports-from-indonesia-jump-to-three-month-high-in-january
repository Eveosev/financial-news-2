Refined tin shipments from
Indonesia, the largest exporter, climbed to a three-month high
in January as prices rallied for a third month.  Exports increased by 5.4 percent to 9,154.7 metric tons
from 8,689.2 tons in December, according to data from the Trade
Ministry today. Sales were 5,380.4 tons in January 2012.  Tin, the best performer among six main industrial metals
last year, climbed 46 percent since July when the metal used in
soldering and packaging slumped to the lowest level since 2010.
Rising supplies from Indonesia may halt the rally and
potentially curb revenues at Malaysia Smelting Corp. and  PT
Timah , the world’s second and third-largest producers.  “Smelters are releasing inventories because of high
prices,” Hidayat Arsani, president of the Indonesian Tin Mining
Association, said by phone from Bangka. Shipments will gradually
drop as smelters upgrade their smelting facilities to meet new
purity standards, he said.  Exports may plunge 24 percent to 75,000 tons this year
because most Indonesian smelters won’t meet the higher purity
standards effective from July, according to the median of 13
exporter and analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg last month.
The minimum purity for exports will be raised to 99.9 percent
from 99.85 percent, the trade ministry said in December.  Shipments last month were the highest since October when
exports were 11,048 tons, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. Indonesia shipped tin to 12 countries, with Singapore
taking 72 percent or 6,583.5 tons, the data show.  Tin for three-month delivery advanced as much as 0.7
percent to $25,029 a ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded
at $24,832 at 3:07 p.m. Jakarta time. The metal has increased
6.1 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
