Romania denied its abattoirs
misrepresented horse meat as beef and said its agriculture
minister will talk to his U.K. and French counterparts in
Brussels this week as the scandal spread throughout Europe.  France will seek sanctions for negligence or fraud and put
the meat and fish industries under surveillance to restore
confidence. Investigators were at the offices of wholesale food
distributor Comigel today,  Benoit Hamon , junior minister for
consumer affairs said at a press conference in Paris.  Tesco Plc , the U.K.’s biggest supermarket chain, said three
tests it carried out on frozen Everyday Value Spaghetti
Bolognese supplied by Comigel contained as much as 60 percent
horse DNA. Supermarkets in France, the U.K. and Ireland have
removed frozen beef products from their shelves since undeclared
horse meat was first discovered by the Irish Food Standards
Authority last month.  While officials have assured the public that the mislabeled
food doesn’t pose health risks, U.K. Environment Secretary  Owen Paterson  said it involved “criminal substitution” and that the
meat probably originated in Romania.  Romanian Denial  “It’s unfair for Romania to have a credibility deficit and
accept a statute of usual suspect,” Prime Minister  Victor Ponta 
said. “We have done our job and we have every interest that
those who are guilty of this fraud are sanctioned.”  France will push for origin labels for processed meats.
Consumers should also be cautious about deeply discounted foods,
Hamon said.  “If you buy meat at a price that is clearly lower than the
market average, that’s maybe an alarm bell about the nature of
the meat you’re buying,” he said.  The multiple intermediaries involved make it tough to nail
down who’s responsible, French Agriculture Minister  Stephane Le Foll  said on RTL radio today.  The meat originated in Romania, went through a Dutch trader
before making its way through an entity in Cyprus to the French
company Spanghero and then on to Comigel, Agence France-Presse
reported, citing the French agriculture ministry.  Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA,  Carrefour SA  and four more
retailers yesterday withdrew frozen lasagna, moussaka,
cannelloni and hachis parmentier made by Findus Group Ltd. and
Comigel after some products were found to contain horse meat.  Findus said it is seeking legal advice about whether it has
grounds to pursue a case against its suppliers.  German Testing  In Germany, Europe’s largest economy, supermarket chain
Kaiser’s Tengelmann GmbH removed its own-brand frozen lasagna as
a precaution as it tests for traces of equine matter in the
products, Der Spiegel reported today.  The U.K. Food Standards Agency last week gave food makers
until Feb. 15 to test beef products. Public bodies such as
schools, prisons, hospitals and the armed forces are responsible
for their own food contracts, procurement and finding reputable
suppliers, the agency said on its website.  Romania said it has investigated the abattoirs named by the
the French company at the center of the investigation. The
country hasn’t exported minced meat, Agriculture Minister  Daniel Constantin  said.  “So far, there is no indication that the meat mislabeling
was done in Romania,” he told reporters in Bucharest earlier
today. “From Romania’s point of view the matter is closed”
until new information appears.  Paterson said that under European Union rules, the U.K. can
only ban food imports if there is a risk to human health. The
Food Standards Agency has asked Findus to test for the
veterinary drug phenylbutazone, known as “bute,” which in
large doses may pose a threat to humans.  In the U.K., routine testing of meat to see if it was horse
was stopped by the previous Labour government in 2003.  Mary Creagh , Labour’s environment spokeswoman, said Paterson should
have acted sooner to order tests after horse meat was found in
beef products in Ireland.  To contact the reporters on this story:
