Petroleo Brasileiro SA ’s American
depositary receipts posted their longest losing streak in five
months as O Estado de Sao Paulo reported that the state-run oil
company is warning the government that its debt ratios may rise.  Petrobras ADRs fell 2.3 percent to $15.81 at the close of
trading in New York in its sixth straight day of declines, the
longest streak since the period ended Sept. 4. Brazilian markets
are closed today and tomorrow for Carnival holidays.  Petrobras Chief Executive Officer  Maria das Gracas Foster 
told Finance Minister Guido Mantega that the company’s ratio of
net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization will rise, O Estado newspaper  reported  on Feb. 8
after markets closed, citing a person it didn’t identify.  The ratio may increase to 3.5 in the fourth quarter, the
newspaper reported. The company’s press office didn’t respond to
a telephone call and e-mail request seeking comment.  Petrobras  reported  a net-debt-to-Ebitda ratio of 2.8 in the
last quarter, up from 1.6 times in the year-ago period,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
