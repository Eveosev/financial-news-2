An Azeri  Defense Ministry  helicopter
crashed over the Caspian Sea, killing at least one crew member.  The Mi-17 helicopter vanished off radar screens at 10:30
a.m. local time today south of the capital, Baku, the ministry
said in an e-mailed statement. Rescue services have retrieved
the body of one crew member and the search for the other two is
continuing, it said.  The crash 250 meters (820 feet) off the coast may have been
caused by limited visibility due to thick fog, according to the
Baku-based Trend news service.  The Mi-17 multipurpose helicopter is an upgraded version of
Russiaâ€™s Mi-8 aircraft. They are in service in 80 countries,
according to the  manufacturer .  To contact the reporter on this story:
