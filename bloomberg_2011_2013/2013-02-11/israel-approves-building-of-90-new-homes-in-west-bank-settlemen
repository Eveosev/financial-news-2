Israel has given final approval for
the building of 90 new homes in the West Bank settlement of Beit
El, a government official said today.  The new homes are part of an arrangement made earlier this
year in which several dozen families living in an unauthorized
outpost adjacent to Beit El agreed to evacuate peacefully in
return for new homes within the settlement, according to Major
Guy Enbar, spokesman for Government Activities in Judea and
Samaria. There is no date set for construction of the units to
begin, Enbar said in a phone interview.  The U.S., European Union and United Nations say Israeli
settlements in the West Bank are illegal and have criticized
plans for additional building as detrimental to the peace
process. Palestinian President  Mahmoud Abbas  says direct talks
with Israel cannot resume until it halts such construction.  The decision comes after the White House announced last
week that President  Barack Obama  will make his first visit in
office to Israel this spring.  “The advancement of this program could overshadow Obama’s
visit,” said Yariv Oppenheimer, a spokesman for Peace Now, an
Israeli group that opposes settlement construction. “This is a
misguided and ill-timed decision,” he said in an interview on
Army Radio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
