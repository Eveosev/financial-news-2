British Land Co. , the U.K.’s second-
largest real estate investment trust, bought London properties
including the Ealing Broadway Shopping Centre from Wereldhave NV
for 183.8 million pounds ($290 million.)  The shopping mall alone cost 142.5 million pounds in an
all-share transaction, British Land, based in the U.K. capital,
said today in a statement. The portfolio also includes retail
and office space in central and west London.  Chief Executive Officer Chris Grigg has focused on boosting
occupancy at the company’s retail properties and attracting
enough tenants to planned developments to justify starting
construction work. Wereldhave, based in the Netherlands, last
month sold all of its U.S. holdings to Lone Star Funds for about
$720 million as it focuses on western European shopping assets.
The company today reported a full-year net loss that exceeded
analyst estimates.  The Ealing Broadway center has 300,000 square feet of
retail and leisure space and the purchase represents a net
initial yield of 6.9 percent, according to the statement.  “There are significant opportunities to grow and develop
the shopping center as a retail destination as we further
improve the retail mix and increase the leisure,” Charles
Maudsley, head of retail for British Land, said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
