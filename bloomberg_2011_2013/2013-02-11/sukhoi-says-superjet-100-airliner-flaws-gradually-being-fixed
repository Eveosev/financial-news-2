Sukhoi  said it is working with
suppliers such as  Safran SA  to modify the Superjet 100 airliner
and cure faults that have hobbled operations in the first two
years of service.  The regional airliner has struggled with a leak-detection
system, the landing gear, and the control surfaces on the wing,
the aircraft maker said in a Feb. 9 statement.  Finmeccanica SpA 
own 25 percent of Sukhoi Civil Aircraft and French firms Safran
and  Thales SA  are key suppliers.  Aeroflot , Russia’s largest airline, said it has suffered
faults on 40 percent of its Superjet 100 fleet, according to
Kommersant. Armavia, the first operator of the jet, also delayed
taking more aircraft last year because of technical shortfalls.  “If there is any fault at any SSJ100 detected, it is
eliminated together by the manufacturer, the supplier and the
carrier representative,” Sukhoi said in the statement. Such
deficiencies are typical for aircraft in the first two years of
service, it said.  Sukhoi, which is owned by United Aircraft Corp., said it
has identified the cause of the leak-detection system
malfunction and changes are being made as quickly as possible.
Four of 10 aircraft have also already been upgraded to deal with
a slat extension fault, a lifting device on the wing.  A landing-gear malfunction has been deemed not systemic
occurring on only two aircraft, Sukhoi said. The company is
working with supplier Messier-Bugatti-Dowty, a Safran unit, to
address the issue.  To contact the reporters on this story:
