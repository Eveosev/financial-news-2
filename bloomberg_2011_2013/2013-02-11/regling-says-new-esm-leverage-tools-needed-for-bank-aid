 European Stability Mechanism chief
 Klaus Regling  said the euro area’s permanent rescue fund would
need to create new instruments to permit private investors to
take part in direct bank recapitalizations.  The ESM has access to leverage tools created for its
temporary predecessor that so far have not been used. Those
tools, which would allow private investors to come in alongside
the euro area in lending money to governments, remain available,
though they’re not suitable for direct lending to banks, Regling
told reporters in Brussels today after a meeting of euro-area
finance ministers.  “We will have to create a new one” if policy makers
decide to move ahead, Regling said. He said the fund will do
technical work to explore possibilities.  Euro-area finance chiefs have set a goal of mid-year for
developing guidelines for how direct bank aid would work. The
new tool, which EU leaders announced last year in a bid to
assure investors that they’d protect the euro from an onslaught
of banking problems, won’t be available until the European
Central Bank takes up its bank supervision duties.  Dutch Finance Minister  Jeroen Dijsselbloem , who leads the
finance ministers’ group, said the currency bloc will explore
options for the inclusion of private investors. The goal is to
have as much capacity as possible for direct bank aid without
putting the ESM’s other missions or its credit rating in
jeopardy, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
