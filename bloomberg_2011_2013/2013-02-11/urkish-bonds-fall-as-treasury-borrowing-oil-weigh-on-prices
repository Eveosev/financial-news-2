Turkish bonds fell for a second day
as the Treasury’s borrowing schedule weighed on yields while
economic data from China and rising oil prices dimmed prospects
for continued narrowing in the current-account deficit.  Two-year  bond yields  rose four basis points to 5.73 percent
at 12:20 p.m. Yields have advanced eight basis points since
hitting a record low of 5.65 percent on Feb. 2. Yields on  10-
year bonds  increased six basis points to 6.93 percent, the
highest level since Jan. 4 on a closing basis.  The Treasury plans to borrow 150.6 billion liras ($85
billion) in domestic debt auctions this year, a 47 percent
increase compared to last year, according to the program
announced on Oct. 31. It may borrow 13 billion liras in five
auctions this month, while paying off debt of 15.2 billion
liras. Borrowing in March and April is planned to reach 10
billion liras and 14 billion liras, respectively.  The advance in two-year yields is linked to the borrowing
program, which “limits downward movement,” according to  Ozlem Derici , chief economist at Istanbul-based Ekspres Invest.  Rising oil prices and the decline of the lira against the
dollar are also having an impact, according to  Bora Tamer Yilmaz , an economist at Istanbul-based Halk Yatirim.  “Oil’s rise is seen as negative for the current-account
deficit and inflation,” Yilmaz said in e-mailed comments today.
Strong macroeconomic data coming from China creates “demand-
side pressure” that may boost oil prices further, he said.  Brent crude has gained 6.5 percent this year to $118.41 a
barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The lira fell 0.1 percent to 1.7729 per dollar, paring this
year’s gain to 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
