Andurand Capital Management LLP took
on as an intern  Clement Lefert , winner of a swimming gold medal
at the London 2012 Olympics, as the oil and commodities hedge
fund expands its team after it began trading Feb. 1.  Lefert will start in May as an analyst with the aim of
becoming a trader in the future,  Pierre Andurand , founder of the
hedge fund and a former member of the French junior national
swimming team, said today by e-mail. Andurand started the
company after closing the BlueGold energy hedge fund last year
following losses in 2011.  Lefert, 25, was part of the French 4x100 meters freestyle
relay team that beat U.S. swimmers including 18-time Olympic
champion  Michael Phelps  in London last year. He holds a bachelor
of science in economics from the University of Southern
California and a master of finance from the Ecole des Hautes
Etudes Commerciales du Nord, a French business school.  “The combination of sporting excellence and great academic
performance show good potential to be a trader,” Andurand said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
