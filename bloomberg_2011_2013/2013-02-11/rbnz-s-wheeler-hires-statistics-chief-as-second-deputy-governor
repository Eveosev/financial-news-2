The Reserve Bank of New Zealand
hired the Government Statistician,  Geoff Bascand , as a second
deputy governor, it said today.  Bascand will replace Assistant Governor Don Abel, who is
retiring, as head of operations from May 27, according to an e-
mailed statement from the Wellington-based central bank. He will
be a deputy to Governor  Graeme Wheeler , who previously worked
with Bascand at the Treasury Department in the 1990s.  Bascand is chief executive officer at Statistics New
Zealand, the government agency that calculates the nation’s
economic indicators. He will help oversee a national census on
March 5 before changing roles.  “Bascand is a very accomplished leader and manager,”
Wheeler said in the statement. “He has strengthened the
official statistics system.”  Wheeler succeeded Alan Bollard in September last year.
Bascand will work alongside  Grant Spencer  as one of Wheeler’s
two deputies allowed under New Zealand law, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
