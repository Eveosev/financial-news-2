U.S. nuclear-power generation
declined to the lowest level in two months as  Exelon Corp.  and
 Southern Co.  shut reactors.  Nationwide production dropped 2.7 percent to 89,651
megawatts, or 88 percent of capacity, the least since Dec. 16,
according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data compiled by
Bloomberg. Output was 2.2 percent lower than a year ago, with 11
of 104 reactors offline.  Exelon’s  La Salle 2 , a 1,120-megawatt unit, halted early
today after operating at 85 percent power yesterday. The plant,
about 11 miles (18 kilometers) southeast of Ottawa, Illinois,
was closed for refueling,  Krista Lopykinski , a company
spokeswoman in Warrenville, Illinois, said by telephone.  Southern’s 876-megawatt  Hatch 1  reactor, 20 miles south of
Vidalia, Georgia, was shut yesterday after “a suspected
condenser tube leak,” a commission filing showed. The unit had
been at full capacity.  Browns Ferry 3, a 1,115-megawatt reactor operated by the
 Tennessee Valley Authority , was at 40 percent of capacity early
today, down from full power. The three-unit plant is about 32
miles west of Huntsville, Alabama.  Output in the the NRC’s  Southeast  region, which includes
Hatch and Browns Ferry, fell by the most since Oct. 27. In the
Northeast,  Entergy Corp. ’s Pilgrim 1 remained closed early
today. The plant, 38 miles southeast of Boston, was shut after
losing outside power during a blizzard that began Feb. 8,
according to the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is at its lowest, may
increase consumption of natural gas and coal to generate
electricity. The average refueling down time was 46 days in
2012, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
