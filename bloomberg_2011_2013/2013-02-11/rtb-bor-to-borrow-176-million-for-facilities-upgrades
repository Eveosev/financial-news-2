RTB Bor, Serbia’s sole copper
producer, is looking for a 131.8 million-euro ($176 million)
loan to complete new smelter and other facilities needed for a
planned production increase.  The financing, approved by the government, will come on top
of 170 million euros already arranged for the smelter, a slag
flotation facility, wastewater processing, a sulphuric acid
plant, a power plant and for paying taxes and insurance, the
state-owned company said in a statement on its  website .  The new smelter, built by Canada’s  SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. 
with Finland’s  Outotec Oyj , is to be completed by early 2014,
enabling RTB Bor to almost double processing capacity to 400,000
tons of copper concentrate annually.  To contact the reporter on this story:
