Hedge funds and other money managers
raised  bullish bets  on Brent crude to their highest level in two
years for a third consecutive week, according to data from ICE
Futures Europe.  Speculative bets that prices will increase, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 192,195 lots,
the London-based exchange said today in its weekly Commitment of
Traders report. That’s up by 12,460 lots, or 6.9 percent, from
179,735 lots in the previous week, and brings net-longs to their
highest since at least January 2011, the earliest point for
which the data are available.  Bearish positions by producers, merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 249,350,
compared with 235,348 a week earlier. It’s the eighth weekly
increase in their net-short position. Swaps dealers were net-
long 77,029 contracts, from 80,651 a week earlier.  Brent rose 1.9 percent on the ICE exchange in the week to
Feb. 5, settling that day at $116.52 a barrel. Brent traded at
$118.05 as of 12:33 p.m. London time today.  Money managers’  net-long bets  on gasoil rose for a seventh
week to 91,036 contracts, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
