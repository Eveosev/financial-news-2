The yen rallied from the weakest
level since May 2010 against the dollar amid speculation Japan
will slow down the introduction of stimulus measures that tend
to devalue a currency.  The yen rose against all except one of its 16 major peers
as the Group of Seven said in a statement it reaffirmed its
commitment to market-based exchange rates. The yen also gained
after North Korea conducted a nuclear test. Japan’s currency has
tumbled over the past three months as Prime Minister  Shinzo Abe 
has pressured the central bank to step up efforts to spur
growth. The euro fell as economists said a report this week will
show the region’s economy shrank last quarter.  “You’ve got some quite volatile moves in the yen,” said
 Neil Jones , the head of European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. in London. “In the short term, price action
is very much subject to, ‘Is the currency war on or off?’ It
seems to be the realms of politics at the moment that seems to
be causing the gyrations as opposed to real fundamental
economics or long term investment strategy.”  The yen strengthened 0.2 percent to 94.17 per dollar at
10:15 a.m. London time after depreciating to 94.46 yesterday,
the weakest since May 5, 2010. Japan’s currency gained 0.3
percent to 126.07 per euro after slumping 2 percent yesterday.
The euro declined 0.1 percent to $1.3387.  To contact the reporter on this story:
