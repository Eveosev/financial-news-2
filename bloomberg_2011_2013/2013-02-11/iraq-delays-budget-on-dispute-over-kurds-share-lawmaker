Iraq’s parliament postponed a vote
on the federal spending plan as Prime Minister  Nouri al-Maliki ’s
coalition requested a reduction in the share of Kurdish
provinces amid a spat over crude sales, a lawmaker said.  The vote has been delayed “at least until next week,”
 Jaber al-Jabiri , a member of the parliament’s financial affairs
committee, said by telephone from Baghdad today. The main reason
is that Maliki’s State of Law bloc wants to decrease the semi-
autonomous Kurdish region’s share of the state budget to 12
percent from 17 percent, he said.  The Kurds have asked for 4 trillion dinars ($3.4 billion)
for payments due to oil companies working in the Kurdish region
in Iraq’s north, while the budget draft allocates no more than
750 billion dinars for those businesses this year, al-Jabiri
said. The Kurds said the 4 trillion dinars cover retroactive
payments from 2010, 2011 and 2012 as well as 2013, he said.  Exxon Mobil Corp ,  Total SA ,  DNO International ASA  and  Genel
Energy Plc  are among companies caught in the conflict between
Iraq’s central government and the Kurdistan Regional Government
over oil-revenue sharing, production contracts and land.
Tensions have deepened in recent months, with armed clashes in
the disputed Kirkuk area in November and a halt in oil exports
from Kurdistan by pipeline in December.  Iraq holds the world’s fifth-biggest crude reserves,
according to  BP Plc  statistics that include Canada’s oil sands.  Disagreements over the Defense Ministry budget also played
a role in the decision to delay today’s parliament session, said
al-Jabiri, a member of the Al-Iraqiya bloc led by former Prime
Minister  Ayad Allawi , an opponent of Maliki.  To contact the reporters on this story:
