The Boston Red Sox will open pre-
season camp without outfield prospect Bryce Brentz, who the
Major League Baseball team said is recovering after shooting
himself in the leg while cleaning his handgun.  Brentz, 24, played for Boston’s Double-A and Triple-A
minor-league teams last season, hitting a combined .290 with 17
home runs and 76 runs batted in over 127 games.  When Brentz’s name wasn’t on a list of the 19 non-roster
invitees to Boston’s major-league camp in Fort Myers, Florida,
Red Sox General Manager  Ben Cherington  said that it was because
Brentz had been recently injured when his gun went off and a
bullet went through his leg. Cherington said Brentz wasn’t
seriously injured and the accident won’t impact his future in
professional baseball.  “We ended up not bringing him to big league camp because
he wouldn’t be able to participate 100 percent,” Cherington was
cited as saying two days ago by  MLB.com . “I think he
understands he got lucky, and it’s a serious thing and he has to
be careful. He’s here in Fort Myers and he’s recovering.”  The Red Sox will hold their first spring training workout
for pitchers and catchers tomorrow. The first full squad workout
will be Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
