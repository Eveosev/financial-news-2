RHG Ltd. , an Australian home loan
company with a market value of A$143 million (A$147 million),
received a takeover approach from non-bank lender  Resimac Ltd. ,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  The bid is at a preliminary stage, according to the person,
who asked not to be identified as the matter is private.  Shares  in RHG were halted from trading ahead of a statement
about a possible transaction. They’ve climbed 3.3 percent this
year, compared with a 7 percent gain in the benchmark S&P/ASX
200 index.  Sydney-based Resimac Executive Director  Mary Ploughman 
declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Sydney-based RHG at
public relations firm Cato Counsel also declined to comment.
Resimac’s bid for RHG was reported by the Australian Financial
Review newspaper earlier today.  RHG reported A$40.7 million net  profit  in the year ended
June 30, and said it had a closed mortgage book worth A$2.49
billion as of Nov. 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
