Soybean futures declined, capping
the biggest four-day drop in seven weeks, and corn fell for a
seventh consecutive session on speculation that record crops in
South America will slow overseas demand for U.S. supplies.  Soybean production in Brazil and Argentina will jump 28
percent to a record 136.5 million metric tons this year and corn
will rise 5.9 percent to an all-time high, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture said on Feb. 8. Rain during the past three days
and more later this week will shrink crop stress to less than a
third of Argentina fields from half last week, and precipitation
will aid crops in Brazil,  Commodity Weather Group LLC  said in a
report today.  “The South America crops are getting bigger, and rains
will add to yield potential this week,”  Greg Grow , the director
of agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago,
said in a telephone interview.  Soybean futures for March delivery fell 1.4 percent to
close at $14.315 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices have tumbled 4.3 percent in four sessions, the
biggest decline since Dec. 20, as concern eased that dry weather
in Argentina and too much rain in Brazil would limit production
gains. Soybeans are down 20 percent from a record $17.89 in
September, when drought cut U.S. production for a third straight
year.  March corn futures retreated 1 percent to $7.0225 a bushel
on the CBOT. The drop capped a seventh straight drop, the
longest since June 2010. The most-active contract has slumped 17
percent from the record $8.49 set Aug. 10.  Soybean Stockpiles  Global  soybean  stockpiles will be 60.1 million tons before
the start of this year’s Northern Hemisphere harvest, more than
the 59.5 million estimated last month and 8.8 percent larger
than a year earlier, the USDA said last week. Corn  reserves  will
be 118.04 million tons, up from 115.99 million predicted last
month.  Brazil will top the U.S. as the largest producer and
exporter for the first time. Argentina is the biggest shipper of
soy-based animal feed and cooking oil.  In the U.S., corn is the biggest crop, valued at $76.5
billion in 2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion,
government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
