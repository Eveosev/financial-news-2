Oil & Natural Gas Corp. , India’s
biggest energy explorer, posted its lowest quarterly profit in
more than a year after giving discounts on crude oil to state-
run refiners to compensate them for below-cost fuel sales.  Net income  fell 18 percent to 55.6 billion rupees ($1.03
billion) in the three months ended Dec. 31 from 67.4 billion
rupees a year earlier, the New Delhi-based explorer said in a
stock exchange filing yesterday. That beat the 53.8 billion
rupee median  estimate  of 35 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Sales rose 16 percent to 209.9 billion rupees.  Finance Minister  Palaniappan Chidambaram ’s attempt to
narrow the budget deficit by raising diesel prices and giving
refiners including  Indian Oil Corp.  the freedom to set future
prices on their own will probably reduce the subsidy ONGC gives
on crude oil sales, helping boost earnings. Under a government
diktat, the explorer must sell oil at a discount to state
refiners, which in turn sell fuels below cost to curb inflation.  ONGC  has gained 18 percent this year, compared with a 0.3
percent increase in the benchmark  Sensitive Index . The shares
gained as much as 3.2 percent to 318.25 rupees and traded at 317
rupees as of 11:50 a.m. in Mumbai.  The price of Brent crude, a benchmark for more than half of
the world’s oil, rose 1 percent on an average in the quarter,
compared with a year earlier.  Higher Expenses  The explorer’s total expenses increased to 141.60 billion
rupees from 120 billion rupees a year earlier, according to the
statement. Raw material costs were 1.56 billion rupees, compared
with 1.52 billion rupees a year earlier.  While net realization from selling a barrel of oil
increased to $47.97 from $44.71, gross realization fell to
$110.16 a barrel from $111.48. A one-time income of 31.4 billion
rupees had boosted profit in the year-earlier quarter.  The lower profit may hurt ONGC’s plans to raise production
and add reserves in India and overseas as it plans to spend 11
trillion rupees by 2030. It plans to expand exploration in India
offshore areas and buy shale gas and oil sands properties
overseas, Finance Director  A.K. Banerjee  said Oct. 2.  The explorer is seeking to reverse dropping oil production
at unit Imperial Energy Corp.’s fields in Russia’s west Siberian
region as it invites bids from surveyors to assess the potential
reserves trapped in shale rocks in the Bazhenov formation.
Bazhenov may hold as much as 360 billion barrels of recoverable
reserves, Bloomberg Industries said in a Dec. 19 report, citing
estimates by Russian subsoil agency Rosnedra. Venezuela holds
296.5 billion barrels, the world’s biggest known oil reserves.  The government is also studying a report by a panel led by
 Chakravarthy Rangarajan , chief of the prime minister’s Economic
Advisory Council, that recommends linking natural gas prices in
India to global benchmarks. If accepted, rates may almost double
to about $8 per million British thermal units, benefitting
producers such as ONGC and Reliance Industries Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
