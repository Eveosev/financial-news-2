West Texas Intermediate rose to the
highest level in more than a week after the biggest gain since
early January. OPEC raised forecasts for the amount of crude it
will need to supply this year.  Futures advanced as much as 0.8 percent, reversing an
earlier loss as the dollar weakened against the euro after the
world’s major industrial nations pledged to avoid devaluing
their exchange rates. U.S. crude inventories probably rose  2.35
million barrels  last week, according to the survey before an
Energy Department report tomorrow.  “Prices would need much more momentum from the economic
growth side to go higher,” said  Gerrit Zambo , an oil trader at
Bayerische Landesbank in Munich, who predicts Brent will trade
from $115 to $120 a barrel this month.  WTI for March delivery increased as much as 74 cents to
$97.77 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the highest since Feb. 1. The contract was at $97.69
as of 1:24 p.m. London time. The volume of all futures traded
was 60 percent above with the 100-day average. The contract
increased $1.31 to $97.03 yesterday, the most since Jan. 2.  Brent for March settlement, which expires tomorrow,
advanced 43 cents to $118.56 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The more-active April contract gained
50 cents to $117.70 a barrel. The volume of all futures traded
was 18 percent above the 100-day average. The European benchmark
grade for March was at a premium of $21.10 to WTI futures.  G-7 Statement  The euro strengthened as much as 0.5 percent to $1.3467
against the dollar as the Group of Seven’s finance ministers and
central bank governors promised they would “not target exchange
rates” in a statement today in London.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will have
to provide an average of 29.8 million barrels a day in 2013, or
100,000 a day more than it estimated a month ago. The producer
group’s output in January was 500,000 barrels a day above this
at 30.3 million, according to OPEC’s monthly market report
published today.  U.S. crude inventories probably increased for a  fourth week 
to 374 million barrels in the seven days ended Feb. 8, according
to the median estimate of eight analysts in the Bloomberg
survey. That would be the longest run of gains since May. All
the respondents forecast a rise.  Gasoline stockpiles were probably unchanged and distillate
fuels slid 1.5 million barrels, the survey shows.  The EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, is
scheduled to release its weekly report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in
Washington. The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute
will release separate supply data today.  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
