Serbia’s fiscal deficit was 6.99
billion dinars ($84 million) in January as spending remained in
line with the budget plan and revenue bolstered by higher
proceeds from sales tax and excise duty.  The gap, calculated according to International Monetary
Fund standards, was 32 percent lower than a year earlier, the
 Finance Ministry  said on its website at the weekend. The
government spent 73.4 billion dinars, mainly for public wages
and pension payments, while revenue for the month totaled 66.4
billion dinars, the ministry said.  Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic ’s seven-month-old Cabinet
targets this year’s budget gap of 121.9 billion dinars or 3.3
percent of gross domestic product.  Serbia wants a precautionary loan deal with the IMF and
needs to convince the Washington-based lender fiscal
consolidation measures remain on track. The IMF will examine
Serbia’s 2012 budget and the implementation of fiscal-
consolidation measures in 2013 before discussing a new loan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
