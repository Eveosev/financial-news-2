Day-ahead electricity in Poland
increased to the highest in two weeks as the country prepared to
ship more power abroad.  Electricity  for the next day gained 4.7 percent to 170.66
zloty ($54.89) a megawatt-hour, exchange data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s the highest level since Jan. 28.  Poland was set to export as much as 1,055 megawatts of
electricity to the Czech Republic, Germany and Slovakia from 12
a.m. to 1 a.m. tomorrow, compared with 5 megawatts at the same
time today, according to data from grid manager PSE SA. Prices
in the neighboring countries increased amid a forecast for lower
wind output.  German  wind turbine  production is below forecast and
expected to continue falling tomorrow, according to the website
of Meteologica SA, a Madrid-based weather company.  Day-ahead electricity on the coupled markets of the  Czech
Republic  and Slovakia jumped 27 percent to 46.38 euros ($62.01)
a megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the countries’
market operators.  Hungarian day-ahead power  settled 28 percent
higher at 47.09 euros a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
