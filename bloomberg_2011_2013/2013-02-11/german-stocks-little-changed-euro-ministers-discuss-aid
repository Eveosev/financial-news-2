German stocks  declined as euro-area
finance chiefs met to discuss a bailout for Cyprus amid
continuing political uncertainty in Italy and Spain.  Kontron AG slid to its lowest price this year after posting
an unexpected annual loss. Carmakers declined, led by  Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG , which fell the most in a week. EON SE climbed
the most since August, while RWE AG advanced to the highest in
more than a week as a gauge of utility companies gained the most
among the 19 industry groups in the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index .  The  DAX Index  retreated 0.2 percent to 7,633.74 at the
close of trading in in Frankfurt. The measure has still
increased 0.3 percent so far this year as U.S. lawmakers agreed
on a compromise budget to prevent most scheduled tax increases
and delay spending cuts that had threatened to push the world’s
largest economy into a recession. The broader HDAX Index also
lost 0.2 percent today.  “We’re waiting for the outcome of today’s finance minister
meeting,”  Robert Halver , head of capital markets research at
Baader Bank AG in Frankfurt, said in a telephone interview. “To
help Cyprus as we did Greece is the only solution that we can
have. This is a difficult February. The three main issues are
Italy, Spain and the U.S. Nobody is right now willing to buy
equities, not knowing the result of the election in Italy. It is
the calm before the storm.”  The number of shares changing hands in companies on the DAX
was 20 percent less than the average over the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ministers Meet  Ministers from the 17-member euro area met in Brussels
today to discuss a possible bailout for Cyprus as a tightening
election contest in Italy and a political scandal in Spain
disrupt market calm. Group of 20 finance chiefs and central
bankers will gather in Moscow Feb. 15-16.  Kontron  slumped 5.1 percent to 4.08 euros, its lowest price
since Dec. 27. The maker of embedded computer boards posted a
full-year loss of 32 million euros for 2012. Analysts had
forecast earnings before interest and taxes of 980,000 euros.  Carmakers declined, led by  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG ,
which dropped 2 percent to 72.07 euros. Daimler AG, the third-
biggest luxury-vehicle maker, slid 1.3 percent to 44.99 euros.
Volkswagen AG, Europe’s largest automaker, retreated 0.9 percent
to 178.90 euros.  EON  advanced 3.1 percent to 13.25 euros, its biggest gain
since August. Shares rose for a second day following a report
that Hungary may pay as much $1.6 billion for the company’s
local natural gas unit.  RWE  added 1.7 percent to 27.83 euros.  Bilfinger Beats  Bilfinger SE  climbed 2.3 percent to 75.65 euros, its
biggest advance since Nov. 19, after the German builder reported
full-year adjusted net income of 275 million euros ($368
million). That beat the average analyst estimate of 273 million
euros, according to Bloomberg data.  Merck KGaA  added 2.1 percent to 99.10 euros. Deutsche Bank
AG raised its price forecast for the shares to 118 euros apiece
from 113 euros, saying consensus earnings expectations for the
maker of the cancer drug Erbitux should continue to rise as the
company will probably increase its 2014 forecast.  Wacker Chemie AG , the fourth-biggest producer of
polysilicon, jumped 8.8 percent to 60.48 euros, its biggest gain
since Dec. 12, after deciding to bring a plant making the
material back to full-time work because of growing demand from
its solar-power customers.  The Munich-based company, which had put about 700 employees
at the facility in Burghausen, Germany, on shorter hours in
October, said it is ramping up polysilicon capacity as the
solar-cell industry revives. Wacker sold more polysilicon than
it expected in January, and production isn’t meeting new order
levels, Ewald Schindlbeck, head of the unit, said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
