Cattle declined to the lowest price
in almost three months on speculation that U.S. meat supplies
are outpacing demand as animal weights rise. Hogs also dropped.  Beef production in 2013 will be 1.2 higher than forecast a
month earlier as weights climbed, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said Feb. 8.  Steers  averaged 1,424 pounds (646
kilograms) in the first four days of last week, up 5.7 percent
from a week earlier, USDA data show. Cattle prices dropped 1.6
percent in Chicago last week.  “The number one problem is the industry continues to
overfeed cattle,”  Dennis Smith , an analyst at Archer Financial
Services in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. Heavy
animals are “going to take the edge off the rally,” he said.  Cattle futures for April delivery fell 0.4 percent to
$1.29625 a pound at 10 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
after reaching $1.2895, the lowest for the most-active contract
since Nov. 15.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement slumped 0.5
percent to $1.4425 a pound in Chicago, heading for the seventh
straight decline. That would be the longest slide since Jan. 17.  Hog futures for April settlement dropped 0.2 percent to
85.975 cents a pound. Prices were up 0.5 percent this year
through Feb. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
