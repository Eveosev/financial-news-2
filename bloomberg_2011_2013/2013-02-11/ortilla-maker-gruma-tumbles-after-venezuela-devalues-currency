Gruma SAB , the world’s largest
tortilla maker, fell the most in seven months on speculation
that Venezuela’s currency devaluation will cut revenue in the
company’s third-biggest market.  The stock plunged as much as 5 percent today in Mexico City
trading to 39.71 pesos, the steepest intraday drop since June.
It was the  biggest decliner  on Mexico’s benchmark IPC index,
which was little changed.  Gruma, based in San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico, got about
 16 percent  of its revenue from operations in Venezuela in 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The devaluation may cut
the share of revenue to 9 percent, said  Gaspar Quijano , an
analyst at Vector Casa de Bolsa SA in Mexico City who  rates  the
stock a hold.  The stock’s drop today is “not that bad considering the
impact that this is having on the company,” Quijano said in a
telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
