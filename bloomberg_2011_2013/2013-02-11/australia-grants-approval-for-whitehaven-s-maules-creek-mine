Australia’s environment minister
gave conditional approvals for the proposed Maules Creek and
Boggabri coal mines in New South Wales state, asking for
additional work to minimize their environmental impact.  The federal environment department last week said it was
delaying approvals for  Whitehaven Coal Ltd. ’s A$766 million
($789 million) Maules Creek and Idemitsu Kosan Ltd.’s Boggabri
mine to jointly assess the environmental impact of the two
projects, located in close proximity in the state’s Gunnedah
basin. Minister  Tony Burke  also gave conditional approval for
AGL Energy Ltd.’s Gloucester coal seam methane project.  “In each of these three additional approvals there is more
work to be concluded before the project can actually proceed,”
Bourke said today in an e-mailed statement.  The Maules Creek and Boggabri projects, in an agricultural
region and in a state forest, have been opposed by environmental
and farming groups.  Conditions include limits for clearance of native
vegetation and provisions for offset areas of more than 15,000
hectares (37,065 acres) to compensate for works related to the
coal developments, according to the statement. The approval for
the Gloucester project is subject to AGL meeting 36 conditions,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
