Portugal’s trade deficit narrowed in
the three months through December as exports rose and imports
fell, the country’s statistics institute said.  The trade deficit narrowed to 2.58 billion euros from 3.12
billion euros in the same period a year earlier, the Lisbon-
based institute said today in an e-mailed report. Exports rose
1.0 percent and imports fell 3.0 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
