BlackBerry  shares fell 4.6 percent
in New York trading after Home Depot Inc. said it will stop
issuing the Canadian company’s phones to its corporate employees
and managers.  The home-improvement chain will swap out 10,000 BlackBerry
models with  Apple Inc. ’s iPhones, said Stephen Holmes, a
spokesman for Atlanta-based Home Depot. The change won’t affect
the 60,000 mobile devices used by store employees, he said.  The move deals a setback to BlackBerry, formerly known as
Research In Motion Ltd., which unveiled a new lineup last month
in a comeback attempt. After years of losing ground to the
iPhone and Android devices, the BlackBerry’s market share has
slipped into the single digits.  Shares of the Waterloo, Ontario-based company fell to
$15.73 at the close in New York. The stock had climbed 39
percent this year before today, fueled by optimism that the new
BlackBerry 10 operating system will be a hit.  Home Depot’s switch to the iPhone was previously  reported 
by the AppleInsider site.  To contact the reporters on this story:
