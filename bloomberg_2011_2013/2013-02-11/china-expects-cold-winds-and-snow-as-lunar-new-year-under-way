Temperatures in parts of northern
China are expected to drop over the next two days as cold wind
sweeps east from the western province of Xinjiang, while rain
showers are forecast for the country’s south.  Light snow and sleet were forecast to fall in parts of
provinces including Xinjiang, Shaanxi, Liaoning and Jilin on the
third day of the annual Lunar New Year holiday, the China
Meteorological Administration said in an e-mailed report today.  Icy weather last week had hindered New Year travel, the
world’s biggest annual human migration. Snow and rain led to
4,680 traffic accidents in Shanghai as of 9.30 p.m. on Feb. 8,
the day before the week-long holiday began, the city’s
government said on its website.  A record 3.41 billion passenger trips may be made this year
during the Lunar New Year period, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported on Feb. 5, citing the National Development and
Reform Commission.  Large regions of China’s south will see localized rain
showers over the coming three days, while parts of Jiangsu and
Sichuan provinces will be covered by fog, the national weather
agency’s report said. It advised holiday travelers to drive
slowly, and keep warm amid the cold and snow.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
