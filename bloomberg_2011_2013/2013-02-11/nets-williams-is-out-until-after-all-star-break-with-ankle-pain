Brooklyn Nets guard  Deron Williams 
will miss the team’s next two games due to ankle soreness,
keeping him out until after the National Basketball
Association’s All-Star break.  Williams, 28, will miss tonight’s game against the Indiana
Pacers in Indianapolis and another road game in two nights
against the Denver Nuggets, the Nets said in a statement.  In 50 games this season, Williams ranks third on the Nets
with an average of 16.7 points per game along with a team-high
7.6 assists. The Nets are 29-22 this season second to the New
York Knicks in the Atlantic Division.  The NBA All-Star Game is scheduled for Feb. 17 in Houston.
Williams is a three-time All-Star selection who wasn’t picked
this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
