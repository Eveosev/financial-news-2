Most  Swiss stocks  advanced, after
two straight weeks of losses for the benchmark index, as
ministers from the 17-member euro region met to discuss aid to
Cyprus and Greece.  Zurich Insurance Group AG and Swiss Re Ltd., Switzerland’s
largest insurer and reinsurer respectively, paced gains. Nestle
SA, the world’s largest food company, climbed after Natixis
recommended buying the shares. Gategroup Holding AG slumped the
most since November 2011 after saying profit fell in 2012 and it
won’t pay a dividend.  The  Swiss Market Index  advanced 0.2 percent to 7,407.6 at
the close in Zurich, paring an earlier advance of as much as 0.5
percent. Thirteen shares on the gauge rose, while six fell. The
number of shares changing hands on the index was 28 percent
lower than the average of the past 30 days, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The broader Swiss Performance Index added
0.1 percent.  “Market sentiment isn’t bad,” said  Alessandro Fezzi ,
senior market analyst at LGT Bank Schweiz AG in Zurich. “In
general, liquidity will be favorable. This won’t lead to
insecurity in the market. This week, with China out and no major
economic data, it will be hard to find direction.”  Euro-area finance ministers met in Brussels today as a
tightening election contest in Italy and a political scandal in
Spain threatened to revive concern about the region’s debt
crisis. Group of 20 finance chiefs and central bankers will
