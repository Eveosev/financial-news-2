German power for 2014 delivery may
advance 3.2 percent after forming a reversal candle on Feb. 8,
according to analysis by FuturesTechs.  Baseload 2014 power, for supplies delivered around the
clock, may rise to 43.45 euros ($58.20) a megawatt-hour,  Liam Roberts , technical analyst at research and training company
FuturesTechs, said from Billericay near London.  “Undoubtedly the trend is still lower but we’re assuming a
countertrend rally and period of consolidation is under way
following the reversal signal,” Roberts said today by e-mail.  The bullish engulfing candle on Feb. 1 was a sign the trend
was turning, Roberts said. A candle chart displays a security’s
high, low, open and close for each day, and can signal a
reversal of a trend or a continuation.  The price of 43.45 euros represents a 38.2 percent
Fibonacci retracement from a Nov. 12 peak of 48.60 euros,
according to Roberts. Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory
that prices tend to drop or climb by certain percentages after
reaching a high or low.  German 2014 power fell 0.5 percent to 42.10 euros a
megawatt-hour at 12:31 p.m. in Berlin, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
