The pound weakened for the first
time in four days against the dollar and euro after an industry
report showed U.K. employment confidence declined in January and
as traders cut bets the currency would strengthen.  Sterling fell against all but one of its 16 major
counterparts as analysts said government data tomorrow will show
consumer prices fell in January, adding to signs the economy is
struggling to recover. The Bank of England will publish its
forecasts for growth and inflation on Feb. 13. U.K. government
bonds were little changed.  “In the U.K. you have a middling performance in the
economy and that’s not good enough to help sterling,” said
 Peter Frank , global head of foreign-exchange strategy at Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA in London. “Growth simply isn’t
good enough. The market had to get out of the net longs.” A
long position is a bet an asset will rise.  The pound declined 1.3 percent to 85.67 pence per euro at
4:26 p.m. London time after appreciating to 84.45 pence, the
strongest level since Jan. 24. The U.K. currency weakened 0.9
percent to $1.5664.  A  gauge  of employment prospects dropped to minus 45 from
minus 42 in December, Lloyds Banking Group Plc said in an e-
mailed report today. A monthly index of job security increased 6
points to minus 16 in January.  Net Longs  The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on an advance in the pound compared with
those on a drop -- so-called net longs -- declined to 1,174 on
Feb. 5 from 10,622 a week earlier.  Futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. The figures reflect holdings in currency-
futures contracts at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as of
Tuesday.  The pound has weakened 3.5 percent this year, making it the
second-worst performer after the yen among 10 developed-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The euro rose 2.5 percent and the dollar advanced 0.6 percent.  The Bank of England’s Inflation Report, due to be published
on Feb. 13 “will most likely show an uncomfortable mix of low
growth and high inflation projections,”  Paul Robson , a senior
currency strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in
London, wrote in a note to clients. “Our baseline is that
policy remains unaltered during 2013.”  The London-based central bank left its benchmark interest
rate at a record-low 0.5 percent and its asset-purchase target
unchanged at 375 billion pounds at a policy meeting last week.  The 10-year gilt yielded 2.11 percent. The 1.75 percent
bond due September 2022 was at 96.91.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 2 percent this year
through Feb. 8, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bunds dropped 1.4 percent and Treasuries fell 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
