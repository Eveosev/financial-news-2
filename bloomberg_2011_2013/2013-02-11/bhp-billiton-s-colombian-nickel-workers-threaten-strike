Workers at BHP Billiton’s Colombian
Cerro Matoso mine, the world’s second-largest nickel producer,
are threatening to strike if the company disciplines a laborer.  The company will hold a disciplinary hearing Feb. 14 to
determine whether to sanction mine worker Jamer Ledesma for an
alleged breach of a safety procedure,  Sintracerromatoso  union
leader Domingo Hernandez said today. The union will decide by
Feb. 21 whether to halt work, depending on the company’s
decision, Hernandez said.  “Surely, if they discipline our colleague, we will have a
labor conflict” and will halt work at Cerro Matoso, Hernandez
said, speaking by phone from Cordoba province, where the mine is
located.  Ledesma is a member of the union’s board. The company
didn’t immediately respond to a phone call and e-mail requesting
comment.  Cerro Matoso is world’s number two producer of ferronickel,
according to BHP Billiton’s  website . A strike at the mine five
years ago contributed to a 16 percent increase in the price of
nickel during the first quarter of 2008. In December, the
company extended its lease on the mine until 2029.  Nickel for delivery in three months settled 0.8 percent
higher at $18,165 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
today. The metal gained 6.5 percent this year after falling 8.8
percent in 2012, the only one of the six LME metals to post a
decline that year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
