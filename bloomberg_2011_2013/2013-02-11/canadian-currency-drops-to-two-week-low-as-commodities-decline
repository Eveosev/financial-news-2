Canada’s dollar slid to the lowest
level in two weeks against its U.S. counterpart as commodities
including crude oil, the nation’s biggest export, fell.  The currency weakened for a third day after dropping Feb. 8
as data showed employment unexpectedly fell, the world’s 11-
largest economy posted its ninth straight monthly deficit and
housing starts sank to the lowest since the end of the 2009
recession. Canada’s dollar declined today against a majority of
its 16 most-traded peers.  “We’re looking at residual hangover from the economic news
Friday,”  David Tulk , chief Canada macro strategist at Toronto-
Dominion Bank’s TD Securities unit, said in a telephone
interview from Toronto.  The loonie, as Canada’s currency is known for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, depreciated 0.6 percent to
C$1.0080 per U.S. dollar at 8:39 a.m. It reached C$1.0084, the
weakest level since Jan. 28. One Canadian dollar purchases 99.21
U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
