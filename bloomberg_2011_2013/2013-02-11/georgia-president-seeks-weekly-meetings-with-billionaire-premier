Georgian President  Mikheil Saakashvili  said he’d like to schedule weekly meetings with
Prime Minister  Bidzina Ivanishvili  in a bid to calm tense
relations between the two.  “The situation isn’t good right now,” Saakashvili told
reporters today in Tbilisi. “The prime minister and president
should meet once a week. This is what the situation in the
country needs.”  Tension is rising between the U.S.-backed president and
Ivanishvili, who scored an upset win in October parliamentary
elections. Saakashvili called Feb. 8 for the two sides to work
together after he was forced to change the venue of his final
annual address because of protests against his opposition to
proposed constitutional changes. His last term ends in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
