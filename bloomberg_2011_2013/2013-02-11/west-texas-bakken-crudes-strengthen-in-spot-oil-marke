Crudes produced in West Texas
strengthened as two refineries in the region shut down units for
maintenance.  Western Refining Inc. said its 128,000-barrel-a-day
refinery in El Paso will run at reduced rates as a planned
turnaround began on the north side of the plant. Alon USA Energy
Inc. shut down a fluid catalytic cracker boiler at its 70,000-
barrel-a-day refinery in Big Spring, Texas, according a filing
with state regulators.  West Texas Sour  oil strengthened by $1.75 to a $4.25
discount to U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate oil at 1:40
p.m. New York time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 Midland WTI  narrowed the discount by 55 cents to 95 cents.  Bakken spot oil delivered in Clearbrook, Minnesota, on the
Enbridge North Dakota pipeline rose $2.25 a barrel relative to
WTI to trade at a $1 discount, according to Calgary oil broker
Net Energy Inc.  In Canada,  Western Canada Select  oil weakened for the first
time in six days, falling 75 cents against WTI to a $25
discount, according to Net Energy, which said today’s WCS
trading was more than six times the volume of Bakken trading.  Consumers’ Co-Operative Refineries Ltd. shut a coker at its
Regina, Saskatchewan, refinery after a fire late yesterday, said
Daryl Oshanek, a spokesman for the 130,000-barrel-a-day plant.  Western Canada  Western Canada Select has strengthened by more than $7 a
barrel against WTI this month as less oil from the U.S. Bakken
fields competed with Canadian crude. Extra production from the
Kearl oil sands project was delayed to the end of the first
quarter, freeing up pipeline space.  Crudes produced in the Gulf of Mexico strengthened as West
Texas Intermediate strengthened against Brent, the global oil
benchmark. Offshore domestic crudes tend to weaken along with
Brent, which is used to price competing overseas imports.  Light Louisiana Sweet ’s premium to WTI narrowed 45 cents to
$21.90 a barrel, and Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium fell $1.20
to $21.25.  Mars Blend ’s premium fell 80 cents to $15.55. Thunder

weakened $1.45 to a premium of $18.75. Southern Green Canyon’s
premium slipped by 80 cents to $14.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
