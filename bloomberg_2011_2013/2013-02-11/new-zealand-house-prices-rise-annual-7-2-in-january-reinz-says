New Zealand house  prices  rose 7.2
percent in January from a year earlier, led by demand in
Auckland, the nation’s biggest city.  Prices accelerated from 6.7 percent in the year through
December, the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand said in an e-
mailed statement. Auckland values jumped 11.8 percent from
January last year.  Central bank Governor  Graeme Wheeler  said Jan. 31 he is
closely watching house price inflation, adding he doesn’t want
to see financial stability or inflation risks accentuated by
housing demand getting too far ahead of supply. His comments led
to increased bets that he will raise interest rates from a
record-low 2.5 percent later this year.  “Agents across the country are reporting continuing
shortages of listings and positive buyer inquiry, even taking
into account the normal slowdown” in the summer vacation
period, Helen O’Sullivan, chief executive of the Auckland-based
institute said in the statement.  There were 4,933  house sales  in January, a 21 percent
increase from a year ago. The median time it took to sell a home
fell to 41 days from 47 days in January 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
