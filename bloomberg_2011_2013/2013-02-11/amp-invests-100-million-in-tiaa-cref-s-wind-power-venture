AMP Ltd ., the Australian pension
provider, invested $100 million in North American wind energy
developer Capistrano Wind Partners LLC.  The investment is “on behalf of a large Australian
superannuation fund client,” AMP said today in an e-mailed
statement. The investment was made by the Sydney-based company’s
AMP Capital Investors Ltd. unit.  Capistrano was formed last year by TIAA-CREF, Edison
Mission Energy and Cook Inlet Region Inc. to develop and own
North American wind energy projects. The company owns five
operating wind farms in Nebraska, Texas and Wyoming with 413
megawatts of generating capacity, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
