An Azeri Defense Ministry helicopter
crashed over the Caspian Sea today, killing all three crew
members.  The Mi-17 helicopter vanished off radar screens at 10:30
a.m. local time south of the capital, Baku, the  ministry  said in
an e-mailed statement. It gave no reason for the accident.  The crash 250 meters (820 feet) off the coast may have been
caused by limited visibility due to thick fog, according to the
Baku-based Trend news service.  The Mi-17 multipurpose helicopter is an upgraded version of
Russiaâ€™s Mi-8 aircraft. It is in service in 80 countries,
according to the manufacturer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
