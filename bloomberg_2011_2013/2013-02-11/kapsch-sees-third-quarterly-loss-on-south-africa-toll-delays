Kapsch TrafficCom AG , the Austrian
maker of road-toll systems, expects a third straight quarterly
loss because of repeated delays to the start of a project in
South Africa’s Gauteng province.  Profit in the three months to Dec. 31 will be on a similar
level as in the first and the second fiscal quarter, Vienna-
based Kapsch said in a statement today. The company had net
losses of 5.15 million euros ($6.9 million) in the second
quarter and 5.93 million euros in the first. Both quarterly
losses had already been caused in part by the delays in South
Africa.  “The executive board came to the conclusion that revenues
which were so far expected until the system start are no longer
to be realized,” Kapsch said in its statement. “This update
will burden the third quarter results, which will be released on
Feb. 27.”  Kapsch has been the second-worst performer, after  Telekom
Austria AG , in the Austrian ATX Prime index in the last six
months. While South Africa delayed and reduced tolls on systems
operated by Kapsch amid protests by trade unions, the company
also faced higher costs in Poland and a slow start of E-Z Pass
on-board toll-calculating unit sales in the U.S., exacerbating
the losses.  Kapsch fell 26 percent in the last six months to close at
42.845 euros today, while the 38-member ATX Prime rose 17
percent. The average estimate for net income this fiscal year is
14.3 million euros, according to the average of four analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
