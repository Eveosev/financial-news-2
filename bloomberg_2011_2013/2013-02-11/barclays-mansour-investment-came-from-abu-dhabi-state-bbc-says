The 2008 cash injection that helped
 Barclays Plc  avoid nationalization came from the government of
Abu Dhabi and not  Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan , the
British Broadcasting Corp.  reported .  Mansour’s investment of more than 3 billion pounds ($4.7
billion) was made through International Petroleum Investment
Co., an Abu Dhabi state-owned investor, the broadcaster said.  Britain’s second-largest bank by assets called it “simply
a drafting error,” according to the BBC. Mansour and IPIC
didn’t respond to questions, it said.  “Barclays is satisfied that the steps taken to disclose
the change in ownership of the companies which were investing in
the bank in 2008 were entirely appropriate in that, immediately
following receipt and verification of that information we made
overnight amendments to the relevant disclosures relating to the
investors in the prospectus documents,” the bank said in a
statement. “The change in ownership of the investing companies
had no bearing on the transaction or required approvals.”  A call to the IPIC switchboard by Bloomberg News wasn’t
answered.  -- Editors: Simone Meier, Edward Evans  To contact the reporter on this story:
