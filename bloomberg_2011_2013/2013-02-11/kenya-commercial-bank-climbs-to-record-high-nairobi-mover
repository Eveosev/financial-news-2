Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd ., the
country’s biggest lender by assets, rose to a record high on
speculation profit increased last year.  KCB, as the lender is known, climbed 3.5 percent to close
at 36.75 shillings a share in Nairobi, the highest since at
least May 1997. More than 2 million securities changed hands,
123 percent of the three-month daily average. The stock has
risen for six straight days, the longest streak in almost a
month.  The company will announce full-year earnings later this
month. Profit in the nine months through September surged 35
percent to 8.69 billion shillings ($99.3 million) as income from
loans grew, it said Oct. 25.  “We expect strong earnings based on what they had done by
the end of the third quarter,” Ted Macharia, a research analyst
at Nairobi-based AIB Capital, said by phone. Profit after tax
will be about 13 billion shillings, he said.  KCB’s earnings per share in the fourth quarter are
estimated to climb to 1.3 shillings from 1.11 shillings the
previous quarter,  George Bodo , head of Africa banking research
at Ecobank Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview.  The stock has climbed 25 percent this year, compared with a
gain of 19 percent for the  Nairobi Securities Exchange All Share
Index , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
