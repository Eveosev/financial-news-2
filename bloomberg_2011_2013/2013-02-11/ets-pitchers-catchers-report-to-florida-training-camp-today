New York Mets pitchers and catchers
officially report to spring training camp in Florida today as
they look to take the first steps in improving a club coming off
four straight losing seasons.  Two Major League Baseball teams -- the Chicago Cubs and
Colorado Rockies -- will hold their first workouts for pitchers
and catchers today, while 15 teams  start training tomorrow . The
Mets and New York Yankees are among the clubs that hold their
first official workouts for pitchers and catchers on Feb. 13.  While the Mets and Yankees both begin  full squad workouts 
Feb. 18, first baseman  Ike Davis  is among the Mets’ position
players who have already reported to camp in Port St. Lucie.  “I’m excited for the season to start,” Davis, who led the
Mets with 32 home runs last season, was cited as saying by
MLB.com. “Hopefully the players that were on the team last year
got a little better and we play a little better this year.”  Spring training games begin Feb. 21, with the Mets’ first
exhibition game two days later. The regular season starts March
31 and the first full day is April 1, when the Mets open at home
against the San Diego Padres.  To contact the reporter on this story:
