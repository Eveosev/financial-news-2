French Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  called for a coordinated international approach to
stabilizing exchange rates, denouncing the “aggressive”
currency-management policies of some countries.  “Exchange rates can’t be subject to moods or
speculation,” Moscovici told reporters before a meeting of
euro-area finance ministers in Brussels today.  “I’m pleading for a coordinated approach at the
international level which enables exchange-rate stability and
also that these exchange rates reflect the fundamentals of our
economies.”  Looking ahead to this week’s Group of 20 meeting in Moscow,
Moscovici said the easing of the European debt crisis and
“factors that relate to more aggressive practices by some of
our partners” are responsible for the euro’s rally. He didn’t
name the countries.  Earlier, the chairman of the euro ministers’ group, Dutch
Finance Minister  Jeroen Dijsselbloem , said the euro’s
appreciation is likely to come up today in the discussion of the
euro area’s economic situation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
