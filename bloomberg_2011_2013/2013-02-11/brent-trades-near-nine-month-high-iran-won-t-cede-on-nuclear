Brent traded near a nine-month high
in London amid concern that tension with Iran may lead to
disruption of Middle Eastern exports. Brent’s premium to U.S.
crude narrowed for the first time in nine days.  The European benchmark was little changed after rising for
a fourth week, the longest run of gains since July. Iran won’t
cede to pressure to halt its nuclear work, President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad said yesterday at a rally in Tehran to mark the 34th
anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. Egyptian President
 Mohamed Mursi ’s secular opponents geared up for marches today.
Bank of America Corp. said there is a “growing risk” the North
Sea grade will rally to $130 a barrel.  “The recent move higher for Brent came amid a combination
of geopolitical jitters over potential supply disruptions if
violence escalates in the Middle East,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in London.  Brent for March settlement was at $118.31 a barrel, down 59
cents, on the ICE Futures Europe exchange at 11:05 a.m. London
time. The number of futures exchanged was 34 percent below the
100-day average. The contract increased $1.66 to $118.90 on Feb.
8, the highest since May 1. The European benchmark grade was at
a premium of $22.80 to the U.S. benchmark, WTI. It closed at
$23.18 on Feb. 8, the widest since Nov. 26.  The Brent-WTI spread has widened since Enterprise Product
Partners LP said Jan. 31 that capacity will be limited until
late 2013 on its Seaway pipeline to the Gulf Coast from Cushing,
Oklahoma, the delivery point for the New York contract.  China Imports  WTI crude for March delivery was at $95.51 a barrel, down
21 cents, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract slid 11 cents to $95.72 on Feb. 8, the
lowest since Jan. 23. The volume of all contracts traded was 29
percent below the 100-day average.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reiterated its forecast that the
Brent-WTI spread will shrink to $7.50 a barrel in the second
quarter as new pipeline capacity relieves a build-up of crude at
Cushing, New York-based head of commodities research  Jeffrey Currie  wrote in a report.  Brent futures gained on Feb. 8 after China reported that
net crude imports were 24.87 million metric tons, according to
data from the General Administration of Customs. That’s
equivalent to about 5.88 million barrels a day, the most since
May.  $130 Risk  “With GDP growth set to accelerate in the second half of
2013 and limited supplies, we see a growing risk of Brent prices
spiking to $130 a barrel this year,”  Francisco Blanch , head of
commodities research at Bank of America Corp. in New York, said
in a report dated Feb. 10.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators cut their
net-long position in WTI for the first time in eight weeks,
according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. Managed
money bets that prices will rise outnumbered short positions by
 212,226 futures  and options combined, a decline of 6,378, or 2.9
percent, in the week ended Feb. 5, the regulator said in its
weekly Commitments of Traders report on Feb. 8.  The average price for regular gasoline at U.S. pumps rose
24.75 cents a gallon in the past two weeks to $3.5918 a gallon,
according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey covers the period ended Feb. 8 and is based on
information obtained from about 2,500 stations by the Camarillo,
California-based company. The average is up 8.17 cents from a
year earlier. It was the biggest jump since the two weeks ended
March 4, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
