The European Union auctioned 3.5
million spot carbon permits at the biggest discount to spot
market prices in more than three weeks.  The sale, held by the European Energy Exchange AG, cleared
at 4.19 euros ($5.61) a metric ton, according to bourse data.  The saleâ€™s closing price was 10 euro cents below the mid-
point of prevailing bids and offers for  day-ahead futures  on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange at 10 a.m. London time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prices for December futures dropped
as much as 5.5 percent to 4.30 euros a ton immediately after the
auction ended.  The exchange had bids totaling 8.1 million tons, giving a
so-called bid ratio of 2.3, the lowest for any carbon auction
since Feb. 1 when Germany offered 5 million allowances,
according to EEX data.  The EU sells permits every Monday, Tuesday and Thursday.
Germany offers allowances every Friday and the U.K. sells
permits every second Wednesday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
