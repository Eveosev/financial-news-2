U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline
strengthened to the highest level in almost a month as refiners
including Alon USA Partners LP and  Western Refining Inc.  began
maintenance in Texas.  Alon â€™s Big Spring refinery is conducting an internal
inspection of a  boiler  associated with a fluid catalytic
cracker, while Western Refining today entered a turnaround that
will reduce rates at the  El Paso plant , the companies said. The
two have a combined capacity of 198,000 barrels a day, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline on the Gulf Coast
strengthened 1.25 cent to  15.25 cents  a gallon below futures on
the New York Mercantile Exchange at 11:59 a.m., the narrowest
gap since Jan. 17.  Reformulated gasoline  to be blended with
ethanol, or RBOB, in the region also advanced 1.25 cent to 10.75
cents below futures. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel  declined  0.12
cent to 2.38 cents a gallon above heating oil futures.  Supplies  of gasoline in the region the week ended Feb. 1
fell 1.61 million barrels to 80.5 million, while distillate
stockpiles climbed  739,000 barrels  to 41.1 million, Energy
Information Administration data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
