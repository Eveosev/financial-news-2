Allstate Corp. Chief Executive
Officer  Thomas Wilson  reiterated his plan to invest in hard
assets such as toll roads and hotels as he scales back on bonds
with longer term maturities amid near record-low interest rates.  “We think investing in long bonds today is just not worth
the risk,” Wilson, who leads the largest publicly traded U.S.
auto and home insurer, said today in an interview with  Stephanie Ruhle  on Bloomberg Television’s “Market Makers” program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
