Tin advanced on prospects for a
fourth year of shortages as copper declined on concerns that
slowing industrial production from Europe to the U.S. may curb
demand amid the highest stockpiles since November 2011.  Tin for three-month delivery gained 0.7 percent to $25,029
a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at 3:39 p.m. in
Singapore. Copper lost as much as 0.2 percent to $8,280 a ton
and traded at $8,284. Markets in China, the world’s biggest
metals consumer, and in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Singapore and
Malaysia are closed today for Lunar New Year holiday.  While tin exports from Indonesia, the largest supplier,
climbed 5.4 percent in January to the highest level in three
months, sales may drop 24 percent to 75,000 tons this year
because smelters probably won’t meet a higher purity rule that
starts in July, according to exporter and analyst estimates last
month. LME copper stockpiles climbed 6.3 percent to 399,825 tons
last week, the highest since November 2011.  “In the near-term, you’re talking about more optimism and
recovery,”  Justin Smirk , economist at Westpac Banking Corp.,
said on Bloomberg Television today. “Once we get into the
second half of the year you’ll start to see what we think is
going to be softer-than-expected U.S. growth, the Europeans
struggling to get any form of traction and of course China
coming out of its growth and stimulus phase,” he said.  Prospects for slowing industrial production weighed on
copper. Output in France, Europe’s second-largest economy,
probably declined 0.2 percent in December from the previous
month, when it rose 0.5 percent, according to the median of
economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg before data today.
U.S. production may have risen 0.2 percent in January from a 0.3
percent gain a month earlier, data may show this week.  Zinc was little changed at $2,206 a ton after reaching
$2,218 on Feb. 8, the most expensive since Jan. 26, 2012. LME
inventories dropped for a third week to the lowest since
November, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Aluminum rose 0.4 percent to $2,127 a ton, lead lost 0.1
percent to $2,419 a ton and nickel was little changed at $18,325
a ton.  To contact the reporter for this story:
