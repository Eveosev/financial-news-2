Russian  equities sank for a fourth
day as  OAO Severstal , the steelmaker run by billionaire Alexey
Mordashov, fell the most in two weeks after an explosion at one
of its coal mines.  The  Micex Index  dropped 0.3 percent to 1,515.89 by the
close in Moscow. Of 50 stocks, 28 declined and 21 advanced. The
dollar-denominated  RTS Index  lost 0.5 percent to 1,581.95.  A gas blast at a Severstal mine in the north of the country
killed at least 16 miners, prompting President  Vladimir Putin  to
order the emergencies minister to fly to the site and handle the
response to the disaster. Severstal closed down 2.5 percent at
355.80 rubles.  Russian equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21 emerging markets tracked by
Bloomberg. The Micex trades at about 5.7 times  estimated
earnings  and has added 2.8 percent this year. That compares with
a multiple of 10.3 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index,
which has gained 0.3 percent over the same period.  Bank Rossii will hold the refinancing rate at 8.25 percent
for a fifth month at tomorrowâ€™s meeting in Moscow, according to
21 of 22 economists in a  Bloomberg survey . One predicted a cut.  Russia, the largest emerging nation to raise rates in 2012,
is facing growing government pressure to ease monetary policy
after economic growth last year slowed to 3.4 percent, the
weakest since a 2009 recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
