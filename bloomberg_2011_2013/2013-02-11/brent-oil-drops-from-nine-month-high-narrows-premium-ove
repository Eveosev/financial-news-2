Brent slipped from a nine-month high
in London, narrowing its premium to West Texas Intermediate
crude for the first time in nine days. WTI fell below $95 for
the first time since Jan. 23.  The European benchmark fell as much as 0.9 percent after
its fourth straight weekly increase, the longest run of gains
since July. European finance chiefs were set to meet in Brussels
today as a tightening election contest in Italy and corruption
allegations in Spain threaten to reignite the region’s debt
crisis. Iran won’t cede to pressure to halt its nuclear work,
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said yesterday in Tehran.  Brent for March settlement was at $117.57 a barrel, down
$1.33, on the ICE Futures Europe exchange at 1:38 p.m. London
time. The number of futures exchanged was 8 percent below the
100-day average. The contract increased $1.66 to $118.90 on Feb.
8, the highest since May 1. The European benchmark grade was at
a premium of $22.52 to the U.S. benchmark, WTI. The gap had
closed at $23.18 on Feb. 8, the widest since Nov. 26.  “The market in London is long due a correction,” said
 Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in London. Some
market participants “already eye resistance at $120. Demand
destruction advocates will become louder.”  The Brent-WTI spread had widened since Enterprise Product
Partners LP said Jan. 31 that capacity will be limited until
late 2013 on its Seaway pipeline to the Gulf Coast from Cushing,
Oklahoma, the delivery point for the New York contract.  China Imports  WTI crude for March delivery was at $95.05 a barrel, down
67 cents, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier today it dipped below $95. The volume of all
contracts traded was 28 percent above the 100-day average.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecast that the Brent-WTI spread
will shrink to $7.50 a barrel in the second quarter as new
pipeline capacity relieves a build-up of crude at Cushing, New
York-based Head of Commodities Research  Jeffrey Currie  wrote in
a report.  Brent futures gained on Feb. 8 after China reported that
net crude imports were 24.87 million metric tons, according to
data from the General Administration of Customs. That’s
equivalent to about 5.88 million barrels a day, the most since
May.  $130 Risk  “With GDP growth set to accelerate in the second half of
2013 and limited supplies, we see a growing risk of Brent prices
spiking to $130 a barrel this year,”  Francisco Blanch , head of
commodities research at Bank of America Corp. in New York, said
in a report dated Feb. 10.  Speculative behavior was mixed for the world’s two main
crude oil futures contracts in the latest weekly reporting
period.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators cut their
net-long position in WTI for the first time in eight weeks,
according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. Managed
money bets that prices will rise outnumbered short positions by
 212,226 futures  and options combined, a decline of 6,378, or 2.9
percent, in the week ended Feb. 5, the regulator said in its
weekly Commitments of Traders report on Feb. 8. In London, money
managers raised  bullish bets  on Brent crude to their highest
level in two years for a third consecutive week,  data from ICE
Futures Europe  show.  Brent Net-Longs  Speculative bets that prices will increase outnumbered
short positions by 192,195 lots, the London-based exchange said
today. That’s up by 12,460 lots, or 6.9 percent, from 179,735 in
the previous week, and brings net-longs to their highest since
at least January 2011, the earliest point for which the data are
available.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc will require buyers to pay a premium
for forward sales of North Sea crude to compensate for
differences in the quality of benchmark oil grades. The price of
Brent, Ekofisk and Oseberg oil sold under 25-day forward
contracts will be adjusted by a premium based on their price
difference relative to the Forties grade, Shell said in an
amendment to its so-called SUKO 90 terms and conditions
published on Feb. 8.  The average price for regular gasoline at U.S. pumps rose
24.75 cents a gallon in the past two weeks to $3.5918 a gallon,
according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey covers the period ended Feb. 8 and is based on
information obtained from about 2,500 stations by the Camarillo,
California-based company. The average is up 8.17 cents from a
year earlier. It was the biggest jump since the two weeks ended
March 4, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
