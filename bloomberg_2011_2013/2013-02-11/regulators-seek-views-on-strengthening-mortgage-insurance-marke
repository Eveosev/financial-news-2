Global regulators are seeking views
on how to ensure that the market for mortgage insurance is
robust and able to withstand crises.  “The events of the last few years, particularly those in
the global financial crisis that began in 2007, indicate that
mortgage insurance is subject to significant stress in the worst
tail events,” the regulators said today in an e-mailed
statement, referring to potential knock-on effects for the
mortgage insurers during a financial crisis.  The report includes draft recommendations aimed “at
reducing the likelihood of mortgage insurance stress and
failure,” according to the group, known as the Joint Forum.  The Joint Forum brings together banking, insurance and
markets regulators from industrialized and emerging economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
