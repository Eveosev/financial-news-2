The rupee dropped the most in more
than a month on speculation capital inflows have slowed after
India’s biggest equity offering in a year. Government bonds were
little changed.  The government raised 114.7 billion rupees ($2.1 billion)
last week, selling a stake in the nation’s biggest power
producer  NTPC Ltd. , the New Delhi-based company’s Chairman Arup
Roy Choudhury said Feb. 8. The rupee weakened for a fourth day
after the U.S. reported the smallest trade deficit in three
years, helping improve demand for the dollar. The Dollar Index,
which tracks the greenback against the currencies of six major
trading partners, traded near a four-week high.  “The rupee’s recent gains were due to bunched-up inflows
and now they are no longer there, we’ll see bunched-up dollar
demand in play,” said  J. Moses Harding , executive vice
president in Mumbai at IndusInd Bank Ltd. “I think the dollar
will stay strong” after the U.S. trade data, he said.  The rupee declined 0.7 percent to 53.8550 per dollar in
Mumbai, the biggest drop since Jan. 4, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 53.8650 earlier, the lowest
level since Jan. 29. The currency fell 0.6 percent in the five
days through Feb. 8, snapping a four-week advance.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the exchange rate used to price options, rose three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, today to 9.28 percent. Markets
in China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia
are closed today for the Lunar New Year holiday.  U.S. Trade  The U.S. trade gap narrowed 20.7 percent to $38.5 billion
in December, the least since January 2010 and lower than any
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 73 economists, government
figures showed Feb. 8. India’s current-account deficit, the
broadest measure of trade which widened to an all-time high of
$22.3 billion in the quarter through September, may be
“significantly higher” in the year through March 2014, Reserve
Bank of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said in Mumbai today.  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 was 7.86
percent today, compared with 7.84 percent at the end of last
week, according to the central bank’s trading system.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 54.72 per
dollar, compared with 54.66 on Feb. 8, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 54.61 versus 54.45. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
