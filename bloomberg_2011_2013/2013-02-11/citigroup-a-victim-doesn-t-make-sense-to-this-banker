Bob Wilmers, the chairman and chief executive of M&T Bank Corp., gave me a call after  my column last week  about some of the bizarre allegations in the Justice Department's lawsuit against Standard & Poor's and its parent, McGraw-Hill Cos. Before I get to his comments, a little backstory: The government's lawsuit last week listed about two dozen collateralized-debt obligations issued in 2007 as examples where S&P allegedly defrauded banks and credit unions. Citigroup was identified as a defrauded investor in nine CDOs that were created and sold by Citigroup itself. Bank of America Corp. was listed the same way for two CDOs it underwrote. The Justice Department suit  also named Â Buffalo, New York-based M&T as one of S&P's victims, in connection with the bank's purchase of subprime mortgage bonds through a deal called Gemstone CDO VII Ltd. However, M&T's fact pattern was much different than Citigroup's or Bank of America's. The notion that M&T might have gotten ripped off by someone other than itself actually makes sense. Gemstone was underwritten by Deutsche Bank AG -- not M&T. After the bonds defaulted in April 2008, M&T sued Deutsche Bank. M&T last year said it settled the case and  received $55 million . The government's lawsuit against S&P said M&T "based its decision to invest in Gemstone VII in part on S&P's ratings of the CDO." (M&T hasn't sued S&P.) So I asked Wilmers: Did it seem right to him that Citigroup and Bank of America were listed among the defrauded investors on CDOs that they themselves underwrote? Here's what he said: Or maybe you have to be a government lawyer. (Jonathan Weil is a Bloomberg View columnist.  Follow  him on Twitter.)
