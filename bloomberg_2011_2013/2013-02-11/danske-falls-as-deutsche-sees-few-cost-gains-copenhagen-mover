Danske Bank A/S  fell the most in
more than two weeks in Copenhagen trading after Deutsche Bank AG
said Denmark’s biggest lender has delivered the cost cuts within
its reach, limiting scope to further boost profitability.  Danske lost as much as 3.3 percent, the most since Jan. 23.
The stock fell 3 percent to 106.90 kroner at 1:27 p.m. in the
Danish capital with trading volume at 75 percent of the three-
month daily average.  Danske, which has cut jobs and raised prices to compensate
for loan losses caused by burst housing bubbles in Ireland and
Denmark, said last week that 2013 profits may double as
impairments drop “slightly.” Deutsche analyst  Jan Wolter  today
lowered his recommendation on Danske to hold from buy, saying
the 2013 forecast is “soft” and that he estimates the
Copenhagen-based lender has now completed about 70 percent of
its planned cost cuts.  “The issue is that management indicates most of the re-
pricing is behind us,” Wolter, who’s based in Stockholm, said
in a note. “The normalization trade is behind us.”  Danske said on Feb. 7 that profit after tax will be as high
as 10 billion kroner this year, compared with a reported 2012
profit by the same measure of 4.7 billion kroner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
