Naftna Industrija Srbije AD , the
Serbian oil and gas company controlled by  OAO Gazprom Neft , said
profit jumped 22 percent last year on higher output and lower
costs.  Net income rose to 49.5 billion dinars ($593 million),
while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization climbed 27 percent to 66.5 billion dinars, Chief
Executive Officer  Kirill Kravchenko  said today. NIS, as the
company is known, increased output 11 percent to 1.69 million
tons of oil equivalent and cut debt 10 percent to $403 million.  “The results show that 2012 was the most successful in
NIS’s  history ,” Kravchenko said at a news conference today.  Serbia’s sole oil producer and refiner, based in Novi Sad,
expanded its market share 5.3 percentage points to 73.9 percent
in 2012 even as consumption fell 9 percent to 2.92 million tons,
he said. NIS plans further expansion in Serbia and other Balkan
countries of Bulgaria, Romania and Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Its shares climbed for a second day, rising 1.2 percent to
846 dinars and valuing the company at 138 billion dinars.  NIS, majority-owned by Gazprom Neft since 2009, plans to
start paying a dividend this year, proposing to return to its
shareholders 15 percent of profit, Kravchenko said.  Investment spending will increase 16 percent to 59 billion
dinars this year, of which 40 percent is earmarked for
exploration and production. The company also plans investments
in its trading and oil processing businesses and expansion into
power production.  “We plan to diversify as well as to boost our resource
base” for oil and gas, Kravchenko said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
