Investors will provide $5.7 billion
annually to finance residential solar systems by 2016, up from
$1.2 billion last year, according to a report from GTM Research.  The third-party financing model accounts for more than half
the solar projects installed atop homes in markets including
California, Arizona, Colorado and Massachusetts, Boston-based
GTM said in a statement today.  With third-party financing, outside investors typically
provide funds for companies that develop solar projects at no
upfront cost for homeowners, who sign long-term contracts and
pay monthly fees to buy the electricity. That’s appealing to
both consumers and financers, and the arrangement is getting
more common,  Shayle Kann , vice president of research at GTM and
the report’s author, said today in an e-mail.  “There is virtually limitless growth potential relative to
the current size of the market,” he said. The solar providers
often offer homeowners “something akin to 10 percent savings on
their current bill.”  SolarCity Inc ., the San Mateo, California-based developer
that raised $92 million in its December initial public offering,
leads the industry with about $1 billion raised from investors
to pay for solar systems, followed by Sunrun Inc.,  SunPower
Corp. , Clean Power Finance Inc., Sungevity Inc. and Vivint Inc.  Investors have provided $3.1 billion in 28 funds, led by
U.S. Bancorp, which has provided more than $1.35 billion to 14
funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
