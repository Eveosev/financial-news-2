Georges  Ralli , former deputy
chairman of Lazard Ltd., is raising a private debt fund of at
least 150 million euros ($200 million) to invest in European
health-care companies.  The IPF Growth Debt Fund 1 seeks to deliver an annual
return of 15 percent to 20 percent by providing senior-ranking
debt to medical technology, diagnostics and life sciences
companies, according to a statement from London-based Avebury
Capital Partners LLP, which is arranging the fundraising. The
fund could also invest in equity to boost returns, it said.  Financing health-care businesses is a “compelling strategy
right now” because of demand from aging populations in Europe
and the U.S. as well as increasing spending in emerging markets,
Ralli said in the statement. The former head of Lazard’s
European investment bank said companies in the region find it
difficult to get financing.  European banks are cutting lending as new standards from
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision more than triples the
amount of core capital they must hold. The banks provided $131.3
billion of high-yield loans to European borrowers last year,
down from $181.4 billion in 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “There is strong interest among traditional private equity
investors and others for debt strategies right now,” Avebury
Managing Partner James Newsome said in the statement. “Growth
debt funds typically pay high cash interest at a time when
interest rates are very low.”  IPF will look to make six to 12 investments at 5 million
euros to 30 million euros each, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
