Thailand’s baht fell to a one-week
low on speculation the central bank will take action to stem the
flow of foreign money into local assets. Government bonds
advanced for an eighth day.  Overseas investors have bought $1.2 billion more sovereign
notes than they sold this month through Feb. 8, Thai Bond Market
Association data show. Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said
on Jan. 31 there’s concern the strong baht, which has rallied
2.5 percent against the dollar this year, will hurt tourism and
exports. The Bank of Thailand may unveil measures to curb
foreign inflows at a meeting on Feb. 20, according to Disawat
Tiaowvanich, a currency trader at Bangkok Bank Pcl.  “There’s demand for the dollar against the baht because
the market is cautious that the central bank may do something to
slow down the capital inflows,” Tiaowvanich said. “That’s why
the Thai baht hasn’t moved on the strong side these days.”  The baht fell 0.1 percent to 29.82 per dollar as of 8:29
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 29.94 earlier, the weakest level since Feb. 1.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 5.62 percent.  Overseas shipments, which account for about two-thirds of
Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy, rose 14 percent in
December after a 27 percent increase the previous month,
official data showed on Jan. 31.  The yield on the 3.625 percent government bonds due June
2023 declined one basis point to 3.54 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
