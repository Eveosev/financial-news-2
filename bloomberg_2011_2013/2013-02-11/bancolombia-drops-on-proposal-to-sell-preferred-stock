Bancolombia SA , Colombia’s largest
bank, dropped the most in six months after saying it will
propose a preferred stock sale at a shareholder meeting.  The  preferred shares  fell 3.2 percent to 30,000 pesos at
the close in Bogota, the biggest drop since August. It was the
worst performance on the benchmark Colcap index, which slipped
0.6 percent.  Shareholders will consider the preferred stock proposal at
the Medellin-based bank’s March 4 meeting, according to a
regulatory filing on Feb. 8 after markets closed.  “This is the procedure the bank goes through in order to
have their regulations up to date in case there’s an opportunity
in the market,” the company said in an e-mailed statement.  The proposal “took us by surprise” and its purpose is not
clear yet,  Juan Camilo Dominguez , an analyst at brokerage
Correval SA, said in a report today. The sale is likely to “not
be materialized in the mid-term,” according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
