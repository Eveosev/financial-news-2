A stampede at a railway station in
northern India killed at least 36 people as Hindu devotees drawn
by one of the holiest days of the world’s largest religious
gathering rushed to board trains.  About 39 people were injured in the crush yesterday evening
near a platform foot bridge in  Allahabad  station and are being
treated at various hospitals in the city, said Anil Kumar
Saxena, a spokesman at the  railways  ministry in New Delhi.  Authorities ordered an inquiry to find out the cause of the
incident. Indian Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  said victims’
families will be compensated and instructed the railway ministry
and the Uttar Pradesh provincial government to provide
assistance.  About  30.5 million  visitors were expected to bathe
yesterday at a place where Hindus consider the Ganges and Yamuna
rivers converge with the mythical Saraswati, according to the
festival administration’s website. Pilgrims believe that bathing
at the confluence of the rivers will wash away their sins and
free them from the cycle of rebirth.  The Kumbh Mela at Allahabad, which is held every 12 years,
expects 100 million bathers during the festival’s 55 days. The
Mela, which means fair, alternates between the cities of Nasik,
Allahabad, Ujjain and Haridwar every three years.  The one
celebrated at Allahabad is considered the holiest of the
locations.  Stampedes during religious gatherings are not uncommon in
India. In 2010, 76 people died in four incidents while in 2011 a
stampede in southern Kerala state killed 102, according to
government figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
