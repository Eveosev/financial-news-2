US Airways Group Inc . and  AMR
Corp .’s American Airlines still are working on details of an $11
billion merger agreement, and any announcement would come no
earlier than midweek, people familiar with the matter said.  The carriers had been heading last week toward board votes
tomorrow and a possible announcement Feb. 12, said two of the
people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are
private. That time line will slip to later this week, they said.  The creditors committee in AMR’s bankruptcy, which has a
meeting set for tomorrow, also would have to support any plan
for a combination before the Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier
could exit court protection.  Todd Lehmacher , a spokesman for Tempe, Arizona-based US
Airways, declined to comment about the deliberations, as did
 Sean Collins , a spokesman for American. A tie-up between
American, the third-largest U.S. airline, and No. 5 US Airways
would create the world’s biggest carrier by passenger traffic.  Reuters reported earlier today on the new timetable for a
merger announcement.  The case is in re AMR Corp., 11-15463, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
