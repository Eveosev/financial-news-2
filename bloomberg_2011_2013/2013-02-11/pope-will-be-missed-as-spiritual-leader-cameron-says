U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron

from the papacy at the end of the month.  “I send my best wishes to Pope Benedict,” Cameron said in

Britain’s relations with the Holy See. His visit to Britain in
2010 is remembered with great respect and affection. He will be
missed as a spiritual leader to millions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
