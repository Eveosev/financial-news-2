Turkish stocks headed for the lowest
close this year and the lira weakened after a car-bomb attack at
a crossing on the border with Syria killed at least 10 people.  The  Istanbul Stock Exchange  National 100 Index tumbled 1.6
percent to 77,438.34 points at 4:59 p.m. in Istanbul, poised for
the lowest close since Dec. 24. The lira retreated 0.3 percent
to 1.7769 per dollar, the lowest in a month.  Dozens were wounded in the blast at the Cilvegozu border
point, according to a report by the state-run Anatolia news
agency. Turkey has supported Syrian rebels in their fight to
topple President  Bashar al-Assad .  “The blast hit market sentiment,”  Mehmet Gerz , the chief
executive officer of Istanbul-based Ata Invest, said by phone.
“What concerns investors is the possibility that Turkey might
be dragged into the turmoil in the region.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
