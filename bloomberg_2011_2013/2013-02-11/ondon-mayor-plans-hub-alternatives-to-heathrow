London Mayor  Boris Johnson  said
he’ll make recommendations this year on a future airport
bypassing the existing Heathrow hub to help shape a government
review on capacity that he reckons is progressing too slowly.  Feasibility studies will start next month with the aim of
backing one or two options in October,  Daniel Moylan , Johnson’s
aviation adviser, told the U.K. Parliament’s Transport Committee
today. The bill for a new hub might top 70 billion pounds ($110
billion).  The British government plans to issue an interim report
this year on its airport strategy, though the final verdict will
not come until after the next general election in 2015 to
mitigate the political fallout. Johnson’s three main options
include two new facilities -- one closer to London and one
further away -- as well as expansion of Stansted, northeast of
the capital.  “That agenda could be accelerated and it would be possible
by early next year to come up with what is the right way to
go,” Johnson told legislators, adding that a new hub will need
four runways and that Heathrow is unlikely to continue as it is.  Johnson said much of the bill would be paid for by private
business. The public cost would be around 25 billion pounds.  The mayor’s office said today it hired engineering
consulting company WS Atkins Plc, Zaha Hadid Architects and
Pascall & Watson architects to help develop plans. Ernst & Young
LLP will explore commercial viability, with others hired for the
impact assessment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
