Australia’s dollar reached a more
than three-month low as traders increased bets on how much the
nation’s central bank will cut benchmark rates, damping demand
for the country’s assets.  The so-called Aussie weakened after the Reserve Bank of
Australia lowered on Feb. 8 its forecasts for inflation and
growth, citing a soft labor market and high currency. It
remained lower after dropping yesterday against New Zealand’s
dollar as reports in the smaller economy showed new house prices
and spending on electronic cards rose.  “The RBA has trimmed inflation and growth forecasts so
that puts us in line for at least one or two more rate cuts in
the next few months,” said  David Greene , a senior corporate
currency dealer at Western Union Business Solutions, a global
payment services network. “Domestic weakness and lack of flow
from a fairly worried offshore market are keeping the Aussie
weak.”  Australia’s dollar touched $1.0241, the least since Oct.
23, before trading at $1.0255 as of 4:42 p.m. in Sydney from
$1.0256 yesterday, when it dropped 0.6 percent. It slid to 96.33
yen after climbing 1.2 percent to 96.73 yen in New York. It fell
0.1 percent to NZ$1.2266 after declining 0.6 percent yesterday.  New Zealand’s currency traded at 83.64 U.S. cents from
83.53 and declined 0.3 percent to 78.54 yen.  Traders estimate Australia’s Reserve Bank will cut its key
rate by 0.49 percentage point over 12 months from the 3 percent
rate now, according to a Credit Suisse AG  index  based on
overnight indexed swaps. The gauge showed expectations for 33
basis points of reductions on Feb. 4.  The yield on Australia’s 10-year government bond was little
changed at 3.46 percent.  Technical Level  The Australian dollar may halt its recent drop versus the
U.S. currency after finding so-called support toward $1.0225,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. said, citing trading patterns.  The area from $1.0255 to $1.0225 contains the 38.2 percent
Fibonacci retracement of the currency’s advance from last year’s
low of 95.82 U.S. cents to $1.0625 on Sept. 14. It also includes
the 76.4 percent retracement from the October low of $1.0149,
 Niall O’Connor , a technical analyst at JPMorgan, wrote today in
a note to clients.  “We continue to see risk of a short-term reprieve to the
recent weakness,” he wrote.  New Zealand’s dollar was supported after a report showed
purchases on debit, credit and store cards rose for a fourth
month. The value of  transactions  on electronic cards rose 0.3
percent in January, Statistics New Zealand said today.  N.Z. House Prices  The nation’s house prices rose 7.2 percent in January from
a year earlier, led by demand in Auckland, its biggest city, the
Real Estate Institute of New Zealand said in an e-mailed
statement.  Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Graeme Wheeler said
Jan. 31 he is closely watching house-price inflation, adding he
doesn’t want to see financial stability or inflation risks
accentuated by property demand getting too far ahead of supply.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates which is sensitive to interest-rate
expectations, rose three basis points to 2.93 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
