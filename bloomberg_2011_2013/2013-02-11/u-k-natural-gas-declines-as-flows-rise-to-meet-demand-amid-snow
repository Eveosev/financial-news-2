U.K. natural gas for next working-
day delivery fell for a second day as supplies rose to meet
increased demand after snow swept much of England.  Same-day and month-ahead gas also declined, according to
broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  Total flows  of gas were as
high as 368 million cubic meters a day compared with a 10-day
average of 324 million, National Grid Plc data show.  Demand  in
the 24 hours to 6 a.m. was predicted at 357 million cubic
meters, the most since Jan. 25, grid data show.  Tomorrow will be mostly dry in London and the southeast
with a low temperature of 1 degree Celsius (34 Fahrenheit), the
Met Office said on its website.  Gas for  tomorrow  dropped 1.5 percent to 66.9 pence a therm
at 4:14 p.m. London time, broker data show.  Month-ahead gas  slid
as much as 1.4 percent to 65 pence a therm, the least since Jan.
3. That’s equivalent to $10.18 per million British thermal units
and compares with $3.24 per million Btu of front-month U.S. gas.  Prices for the fuel may rise as cold weather increases
demand in the coming two weeks, Deutsche Bank AG said in a
research note today. Average demand in the U.K. will be 258
million cubic meters a day in the next 14 days, compared with a
seasonal norm of 225 million, and will reach 281 million in the
three days starting Feb. 18, according to the bank.  Flows from  Norway , the U.K.’s biggest source of gas
imports, were at 110 million cubic meters a day versus a 10-day
average of 106 million, Gassco AS data show.  Dutch  imports
touched 38 million cubic meters a day, the most since Jan. 25,
National Grid data show.  Pipeline imports from  Belgium  were at 19 million cubic
meters a day, after reaching 25 million Feb. 9, the most since
Jan. 21, Interconnector data show.  The average U.K. temperature through Feb. 17 will be 3.4
degrees Celsius, according to the GFS weather model supplied to
Bloomberg by MetraWeather at 4:23 p.m. London time. The previous
forecast was for 4.3 degrees.  Gas accounted for 37 percent of U.K. power production at
4:15 p.m., grid data show. Coal generated 38 percent, nuclear 15
percent and wind 4.5 percent.  Wind  will produce as much as 1,564 megawatts of power
tomorrow, according to Bloomberg calculations, after peaking at
4,040 megawatts today, grid data show.  Electricity  for the next-working day fell 2.9 percent to
50.50 pounds a megawatt-hour, broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
