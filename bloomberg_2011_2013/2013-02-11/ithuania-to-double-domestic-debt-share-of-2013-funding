Lithuania plans to double the
proportion of its borrowing from domestic debt and may stay out
of the international market for the rest of this year,  Finance Minister Rimantas Sadzius  said.  The government will look to local investors for 75 percent
of the 7 billion litai ($2.7 billion) of issuance planned for
this year, Sadzius said in an interview in the capital Vilnius
on Feb. 8. The domestic market accounted for just 37 percent of
the 11 billion litai raised by Lithuania last year.  Lithuania sold 400 million euros ($535 million) of 2018
bonds in euros at a yield of 2.631 percent on Jan. 28. Analysts
had been expecting a further $1 billion or more of foreign bonds
this year, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s
Mohammed Kazmi.  “The minister’s comments are a little surprising, given
that Lithuania faces external interest and principal repayments
of close to $2 billion this year,” Kazmi, an emerging-markets
strategist in London, said by e-mail today. “The reduced supply
will likely be positive for Lithuanian foreign bonds.”  The yield on Lithuania’s 2018 euro bond rose less than one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.69 percent, as of
11:50 a.m. in Vilnius.  “Our strategy has shifted toward the internal market,
where we see huge possibilities,” said Sadzius, who took office
in December.  Market Surprise  Lithuania plans to use some of the money it borrows at home
for projects including housing, which Sadzius said would
generate jobs and business.  Lenders in Lithuania have cash to invest as companies and
households reduced their debts and increased savings after the
global economic turmoil that began in 2008, according to the
minister. The government wants to take advantage of that “large
amount of cheap credit resources,” he said.  The government today sold 35 million litai of 2016 bonds at
an average yield of 2.035 percent through an auction on the
Nasdaq OMX Vilnius exchange today.  Lithuania is due to repay 1 billion euros of bonds on March
5 that it first issued in 2003, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “If everything goes as planned, perhaps we will have no
further need to go to international financial markets this year,
unless perhaps we decide to shift borrowing that’s planned for
the first quarter of 2014 forward to the last quarter of this
year,” Sadzius said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
