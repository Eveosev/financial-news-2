At least 10 coalminers died in an
explosion, which may have been caused by a build-up of methane,
at a deposit owned by OAO Severstal, according to the Emergency
Ministry.  Nine workers are still missing, while four escaped to the
surface at the Vorkutinskaya mine in Russia’s northern Komi
region, the ministry’s regional division said on its  website .  About 20 workers at were in the area where the blast
occurred at about 10 a.m. Moscow time, the regional police said
in a statement on their  website .  The  Vorkutinskaya  mine, built in 1973, has annual capacity
of 1.8 million tons of coal, according to Severstal’s website.
The steelmaker confirmed the blast in an e-mailed statement,
without commenting on the cause or death toll. Severstal shares
fell as much as 2.4 percent and traded down 2.1 percent at
357.40 rubles by 2:05 p.m. in Moscow.  “Reputational and political risks may be more important
than financial losses,”  Kirill Chuyko , head of equity research
at BCS Financial Group in Moscow, said by phone. Severstal’s
coal output is unlikely to suffer much, he said.  An investigation has been opened into potential safety
violations at the mine, Interfax reported, citing  Vladimir Markin , the Investigative Committee’s spokesman.  Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev ordered the government to
provide aid to the families of the victims and those injured,
