Philippine five-year bonds fell for
the first time in four days on speculation demand cooled after
the yield declined to a record last week. The peso was steady.  The yield on the government notes due 2018 reached 3.5
percent on Feb. 8, the lowest level since they were issued in
2011. The rate slid 43 basis points last month as the central
bank cut the interest rate on almost 1.7 trillion pesos ($42
billion) in its special-deposit accounts to 3 percent, while
holding the benchmark overnight rate at 3.5 percent.  “The rally in the local government securities market is a
little bit overdone,” said  Rafael Algarra , executive vice
president at Security Bank Corp. in Manila. “The market has
already absorbed the effects of the cut in special-deposit
account rates. We are going to start seeing defensive postures
as some people take profit.”  The yield on the 5 percent bonds due August 2018 rose seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 3.57 percent as of
4:44 p.m. local time, according to prices from Tradition
Financial Services.  The peso closed at 40.690 per dollar, compared with 40.678
at the end of last week, data from Tullett Prebon Plc show. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, was unchanged at 4.25
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
