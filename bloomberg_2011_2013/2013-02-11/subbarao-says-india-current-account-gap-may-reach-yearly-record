Reserve Bank of India Governor
 Duvvuri Subbarao  comments on inflation, the current-account
deficit and monetary policy. He was giving a speech to students
in Mumbai today.  On the current-account deficit:  “Today, the external sector is vulnerable. Last year, the
current-account deficit was 4.2 percent of gross domestic
product. This year, 2012-13, we expect the current-account
deficit is going to be significantly higher than that. So, it’s
going to be historically the highest current-account deficit
measured as a proportion of GDP.”  On economic situation:  “If you take the macro-economic context today, we’ll find
that growth has moderated, inflation has come off from the peak
but even at 7-plus percent is still high. Investment has not
only decelerated but has actually declined. The external sector
is very vulnerable. That’s the macro-economic context in which
we have been formulating our monetary policy.  ‘‘Declining growth demands that the Reserve Bank ease and
reduce interest rates but stubborn inflation requires that we
keep interest rates high. So, how do we calibrate that balance,
how do we calibrate interest rates? That’s been a constant
struggle at the Reserve Bank.”  On investment:  “Growth has slowed because consumption has fallen, net
exports have fallen, and most importantly investment has
declined. That is a matter of great concern because today’s
investment is tomorrow’s production capacity. So if investment
is not taking place today, our growth potential on the way
forward is going to be hurt.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
