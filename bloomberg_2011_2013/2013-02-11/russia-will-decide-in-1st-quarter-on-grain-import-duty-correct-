Russia, the world’s third biggest
wheat exporter last season, will decide on measures to cancel
the country’s 5 percent import duty on grains before April.  “The decision will be made in the first quarter,” Aliya
Samigullina, Deputy Prime Minister  Arkady Dvorkovich ’s
spokeswoman, said by phone in Moscow today. Duty-free proposals
from the ministries of agriculture and economy are being
considered, she said.  The Agriculture Ministry wants the duty-free period to last
until at least July 1, or mid-summer, while the Economy Ministry
wants it to go until Aug. 1, she said. Last week, Dvorkovich
expressed support for the Agriculture Ministry’s proposal,
however a final decision still needs to be made, Samigullina
said.  Crops in Russia were seared by drought this season and the
country aims to increase domestic grain supplies by selling
cereals from state stockpiles. Cutting the import duty on wheat,
barley, rye and corn could be positive for the domestic market,
Dvorkovich said last week.  Russia harvested 70.7 million metric tons of grain in
2012-13, or 25 percent less than a year earlier, according to
state statistics data.  Wheat for March delivery dropped 0.6 percent to $7.515 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 1:26 p.m. Moscow time,
and is down 3.4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
