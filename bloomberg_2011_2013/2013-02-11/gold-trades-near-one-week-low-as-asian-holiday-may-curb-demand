Gold fell to the lowest in more than
a month on speculation that physical demand will slow during
this week’s Lunar New Year holiday in Asia.  The absence of the Chinese market this week means demand
from other regions has a larger gap to plug, thus exposing
prices to a “fragile floor,”  Suki Cooper , an analyst at
Barclays Plc in New York, wrote today in a report. Prices also
fell as ministers from the 17-member euro area met in Brussels
today to discuss a possible bailout for Cyprus as a tightening
election contest in Italy and a political scandal in Spain
threaten to reignite the region’s debt crisis.  “Lack of physical demand, coupled with worries about
Europe, pushed the market lower,”  David Meger , the director of
metals trading at Vision Financial Markets in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview.  Gold futures for April delivery retreated 1.1 percent to
settle at $1,649.10 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, extending this year’s drop to 1.6 percent. Prices earlier
touched $1,644.10, the lowest for a most-active contract since
Jan. 7. Trading volume was about 20 percent higher than the
average in the past 100 days.  The metal fell below the 200-day moving average near
$1,665.36, a bearish signal to some analysts who study
historical price patterns.  “Today’s fall was exaggerated by the technical weakness,”
Meger said.  Silver futures for March delivery retreated 1.7 percent to
$30.91 an ounce in New York, the biggest drop in more than a
week.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
April delivery fell 1.1 percent to $1,696.10 an ounce, the third
straight loss.  Palladium futures for March delivery jumped 0.9 percent to
$758.60 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
