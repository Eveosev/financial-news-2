Banks should have tougher internal
auditors to stand up to senior decision makers within the firm
and oversee risk taking, said  Andrew Bailey , head of banking
supervision at the Financial Services Authority.  Regulators now expect banks to have internal auditors that
can provide a challenge to management, “driving improved
governance, risk management and internal controls,” Bailey said
in an e-mailed statement.  “The expectations of internal audit functions within
financial services firms have hitherto been set too low,”
Bailey said.  Bailey’s comments came in support of draft guidelines
published today by the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors
that seek to improve governance within banks. Internal auditors
assess whether organizations are managing risk properly and warn
members of the firm’s board if they anticipate problems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
