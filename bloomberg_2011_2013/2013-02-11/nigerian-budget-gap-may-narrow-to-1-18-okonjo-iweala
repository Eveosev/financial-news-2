Nigeria’s budget deficit may narrow
to 1.18 percent of gross domestic product this year after
adjustments were made by the National Assembly, Finance Minister
 Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala  said.  That compares with the 2.17 percent target estimated by
President  Goodluck Jonathan  in October, Okonjo-Iweala said today
at a conference in Lagos, the commercial capital. She didn’t
elaborate on what changes were made by lawmakers.  The National Assembly on Dec. 20 approved a 4.98 trillion
naira ($32 billion) budget for 2013, higher than the 4.92
trillion naira spending plan presented by Jonathan. Lawmakers
increased the benchmark oil price by $4 to $79 a barrel,
providing more funds to the government to spend. The country
expects to produce 2.53 million barrels of oil a day this year,
according to the budget.  The government will create a housing finance institution
that may begin operating by the end of the year with investments
from the government, businesses and multilateral finance
institutions, Okonjo-Iweala said. The World Bank is providing
$300 million liquidity finance for the project, she said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
