The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in Japan against non-payment declined, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell three basis points to
124 basis points as of 9:06 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Deutsche
Bank AG prices. Japanâ€™s financial markets were closed yesterday
for a national holiday.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed half a basis
point to 116.5 as of 11:09 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp. The benchmark yesterday closed at its lowest level
since Jan. 28, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
private market.  Markets in Hong Kong and Singapore are shut today for lunar
new year celebrations.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
