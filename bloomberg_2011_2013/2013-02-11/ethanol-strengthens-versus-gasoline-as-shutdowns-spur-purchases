Ethanol strengthened against
gasoline as mill shutdowns spurred purchases by customers and
producers of the biofuel.  The spread narrowed 4.15 cents to 60.53 cents a gallon at
10:39 a.m. New York time as gasoline plunged. More than 1.4
billion gallons of the country’s 14.7 billion of ethanol
production have been suspended because of expensive
manufacturing costs.  “We’re seeing a lot of producer buying with the
shutdowns,” said  Jim Damask , a manager at StarFuels Inc. in
Jupiter, Florida. “You already have end-users buying and now
you have ethanol producers buying. It’s created frenzy.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery slipped 0.3 cent to
$2.415 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have
advanced 10 percent this year.  Gasoline for March delivery dropped 3.85 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $3.0203 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol.  Ethanol companies may have signed contracts to deliver the
fuel before they shut plants as a result of higher-than-normal
corn prices caused by drought.  “They sold the ethanol already so they need to buy to
fulfill commitments,” Damask said. “Sometimes if they shut
down the plant they figure it’s cheaper to buy the ethanol than
to make it.”  Plants Shut  At least 19 plants have been idled since June because of
production costs and a supply glut, according to the Renewable
Fuels Association, a Washington-based trade group.  Corn for March delivery gained 2 cents to $7.11 a bushel in
Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread, or the profit that can be made from
turning a bushel of corn into ethanol, was minus 16 cents a
gallon, up from minus 17 cents Feb. 8 and 23 cents a week ago,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol will consume about 42 percent of the 10.78 billion
bushels of corn in this year’s harvest, the USDA said Feb. 8, up
from 41 percent last year and 40 percent in 2011.  The plant closings have helped ease a glut of the fuel as
stockpiles in the week ended Feb. 1 totaled 20 million barrels,
4.6 percent lower than a year earlier, according to the U.S.
Energy Information Administration, the statistical agency of the
Energy Department.  Production  rose 0.5 percent to 774,000 barrels a day from
the previous week, the lowest level since the EIA began tracking
weekly data for the biofuel in June 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
