Soybeans fell in Chicago, extending
the biggest drop in almost three months and leading farm
commodities lower after the U.S. government raised its outlook
for world inventories of the oilseed.  Global  soybean stockpiles  will be 60.1 million metric tons
before this year’s Northern Hemisphere harvest, more than the
59.5 million estimated last month on higher output in Brazil,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Feb. 8. Analysts had
expected inventories to fall to 59.1 million tons, a Bloomberg
survey showed.  “People expected a bigger drop in Argentina, so that
disappointed, and the USDA forecast higher-than-expected
production in Brazil,” Antoine Liagre, an oilseeds analyst at
Bourges, France-based farm adviser Offre et Demande Agricole,
said by phone. “The result was an unexpected outlook for higher
world stocks.”  Soybeans for delivery in March slid 1.4 percent to $14.315
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 12:53 p.m. Paris time.
Prices reached $14.2925, the lowest level since Jan. 25, after
retreating 2.3 percent by the close on Feb. 8, the largest
decline since Nov. 12. The oilseed headed for a fourth retreat
today, which would match a streak ended Jan. 11.  The harvest in  Brazil , the biggest grower, will climb to a
record 83.5 million tons, against last month’s forecast of 82.5
million, the USDA said. Farmers in Argentina will reap 53
million tons this marketing year, below 54 million estimated in
January, the USDA said. Its outlook exceeded the average
estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg of 82.7 million tons
for Brazil and 52.9 million tons for Argentina.  Chinese Imports  There may also be concern about cancellations of Chinese
purchases of U.S. soybeans later in the season, said Kieran
Walsh, a commodities broker at Aurel BCG in Paris. The Asian
nation is the world’s biggest importer of the oilseed.  Harvests in South America will help satisfy “rampant”
global soybean demand, according to  Luke Mathews , a commodity
strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.  Soybeans are 2.03 times more expensive than corn, the  least 
in a week, compared with a 10-year average of 2.4 times. The
crops compete for acreage.  Corn for delivery in March slipped 0.4 percent to $7.0625 a
bushel, on course for a seventh drop in a row, and wheat for
delivery the same month fell 0.6 percent to $7.52 a bushel.
Milling wheat for delivery in May traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris
declined 0.2 percent to 241 euros ($322) a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
