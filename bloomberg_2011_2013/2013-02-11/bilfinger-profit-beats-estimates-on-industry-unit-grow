Bilfinger SE  forecast an increase in
profit in 2013, driven by savings and demand for engineering
work and services in the power industry.  The German builder is budgeting for an increase in the
volume of work, even as it reduces the number of low-margin
construction projects it takes on, the company said in a
statement today. Bilfinger reported a 2 percent gain in sales
last year to 8.64 billion euros ($12 billion). Its shares rose
as much as 2.4 percent in Frankfurt.  Chief Executive Officer  Roland Koch  said last month that
the company has an 850 million-euro strong warchest for
acquisitions, which are part of his strategy to reorganize the
company.  HeidelbergCement AG , the world’s third-largest maker of
cement, posted quarterly profit last week that exceeded
analysts’ estimates as growth in North America, higher prices
and cost cuts offset a slump in Europe.  Koch last year improved Bilfinger’s earnings before taxes
and amortization margin to 5.4 percent from 4.7 percent.
Earnings on that basis gained 25 percent to 277 million euros.  Bilfinger traded 1.7 percent higher at 75.25 euros as of
9:39 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
