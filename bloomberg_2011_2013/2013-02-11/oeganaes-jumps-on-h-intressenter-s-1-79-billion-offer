Hoeganaes AB  rose to a record after
holding company H Intressenter made an offer for the Swedish
maker of iron and metal powders, valuing it at about 11.5
billion kronor ($1.79 billion).  Hoeganaes  jumped  as much as 17 percent to 320 kronor, the
highest intraday price since April 1994, and was trading at
319.5 kronor as of 9:40 a.m. in Stockholm, giving the company a
market value of 11.2 billion kronor.  H Intressenter, jointly owned by closely held Lindengruppen
AB and Foundation Asset Management Sweden AB, is offering 320
kronor a share in cash, according to a statement today. The
price is 17 percent higher than the Class B-stock closing price
on Feb. 8. H Intressenter currently controls 34.4 percent of the
stock and 47.9 percent of votes in the Hoeganaes, Sweden-based
company.  “Lindengruppen’s ambition is to develop the businesses we
own in a private context,” Chairwoman  Jenny Linden Urnes  said
in the statement. Foundation Asset Management “shares our view
on long-term ownership.”  The bidder said it has great confidence in Hoeganaes’s
current management team and existing strategies, and that the
offer was announced before the board of Hoeganaes has had the
opportunity to evaluate it. Three members of the Hoeganaes board
are also members of the Lindengruppen board.  Lindengruppen has been the largest shareholder in Hoeganaes
both before and since the manufacturer’s listing in 1994 and
prior to the offer held 21.8 percent of shares and 37.8 percent
of votes. H Intressenter has also acquired Industrivarden AB’s
12.6 percent share stake at 320 kronor a share.  Foundation Asset Management will contribute with
“significant experience from owning and developing industrial
companies and a strong global network,” according to the
statement. The fund, with headquarters in Stockholm, is owned by
the three largest Wallenberg-family foundations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
