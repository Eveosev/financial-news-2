Weather will be “mainly
satisfactory” for Russian winter crops today and during the
next nine days, the state weather forecaster said.  In the first 10 days of February, temperatures of as much
as 11 degrees Celsius (51.8 degrees Fahrenheit) melted snow and
helped plants resume growth in the southern part of Krasnodar,
Russia’s biggest regional crop area this season, and in some
southern parts of the North-Caucasus Federal District, the
weather center said on its website.  Krasnodar harvested 8.8 million metric tons of grains this
season, or 13 percent of the national crop. The North-Caucasus
district harvested about 6.7 million tons, or 9.4 percent of the
national crop, according to the state statistics data.  Crops face some risk of damage from excessive wetness in
parts of Tver, Novgorod, Yaroslavl and Kostroma regions, which
are north-east of Moscow, and covered by 45 centimeters (18
inches) of snow, while frost is weak, the center said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
