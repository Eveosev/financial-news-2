Gasoline fell after a winter
snowstorm blanketed the Northeast, reducing driving demand, and
as Brent crude slipped.  Futures slid as much as 1.7 percent after more than 2 feet
of snow fell in parts of the Northeast, shutting roads. Brent
crude sank 0.7 percent in London as the Brent-WTI spread
tightened for the first time in nine days, shrinking 92 cents to
$22.26 a barrel. Gasoline’s crack spread versus Brent narrowed
17 cents to $9.40 a barrel.  “In the run-up to last week, everybody was worried about
supplies in New York Harbor, but we got a little bit of a break
because nobody could get out of their house,” said  Phil Flynn ,
senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.
“Before the storm everybody filled their gas tank, and now
nobody can find their cars.”  Gasoline for March delivery fell 2.26 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $3.0362 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Volume was 5.9 percent above the 100-day average at
11:04 a.m. in New York.  Heating oil for March delivery declined 0.8 cent to $3.2304
a gallon on volume that’s 21 percent below average.  Gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.5 cent to
$3.587 a gallon, AAA said on its website today. Prices are the
highest since Oct. 24, and 8.1 cents above a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
