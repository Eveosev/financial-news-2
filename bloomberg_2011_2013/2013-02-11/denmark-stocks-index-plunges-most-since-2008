Denmark’s benchmark Copenhagen OMX
20 Index headed for its worst retreat since 2008 after its
largest constituent Novo Nordisk A/S failed to obtain U.S.
approval for an insulin medicine.  The OMX Copenhagen 20 index lost 5.7 percent to 525.21 at
10:30 a.m. local time, headed for the worst performance since
falling 6.4 percent on Nov. 6, 2008. Novo Nordisk, which
accounted for  46 percent  of the benchmark as of last week, fell
as much as 17 percent.  Today’s drop pushes the benchmark gauge to the 12th rank
this year among 24 developed markets tracked by Bloomberg News.
The measure has still advanced 5.7 percent so far in 2013.  Novo Nordisk’s gains in the past four years helped the  OMX
Copenhagen 20  beat European stocks every year since 2008. The
300 percent rally in the drug company’s shares since April 2009
prompted NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen this month to ask media outlets
to use an existing version of the index that caps any member
weighting at 20 percent.  Novo Nordisk, the world’s largest insulin maker, failed to
win approval for a new insulin as regulators sought a study to
assess heart risk, dealing the company a setback in its contest
with Sanofi for the diabetes market.  The Food and Drug Administration issued a so-called
complete response letter Feb. 8, saying the insulin, Tresiba,
can’t be approved without more data on heart safety. Novo
Nordisk said it’s unlikely to be able to provide the information
next year. The FDA said Novo Nordisk also must resolve a warning
letter on one of its plants before Tresiba is approved.  Shares in the Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based company dropped 12
percent to 946 kronor at 10:30 a.m. in Copenhagen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
