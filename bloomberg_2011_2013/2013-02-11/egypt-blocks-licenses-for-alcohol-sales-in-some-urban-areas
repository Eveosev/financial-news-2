Egypt will stop issuing licenses for
stores to sell alcoholic drinks in some urban areas, a
government official said.  The new rule will apply in satellite cities, newly built
districts on the fringes of the main population centers, Nabil
Abbas, vice-president of the New Urban Communities Authority,
said in a phone interview today. Existing liquor stores in such
areas will not be allowed to renew their licenses, he said.  “We cannot allow stores spreading debauchery in our
society,” Abbas said. He said the decision reflected
“religious, social and health considerations” and came after
complaints from residents and city councils requesting a ban.  The measure may add to concerns that restrictions on
alcohol will tighten under President  Mohamed Mursi , elected in
June as the Muslim Brotherhood’s candidate, hurting a tourism
industry that is already struggling amid political unrest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
