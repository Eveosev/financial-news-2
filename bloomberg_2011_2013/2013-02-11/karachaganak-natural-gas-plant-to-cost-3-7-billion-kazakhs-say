Kazakhstan plans to spend $3.7
billion on a natural gas processing plant at the BG Group Plc-
led Karachaganak field next year as it seeks to supply the fuel
to its domestic market.  The facility will supply the capital Astana and northern
regions by 2017, state-owned KazMunaiGaz National Co. said today
in an e-mailed reply to questions today. It may be expanded from
2019 to 2021 and have a capacity of 5 billion cubic meters a
year, or more than half the country’s demand in 2011.  Kazakhstan last year acquired 10 percent of the
Karachaganak oil and gas project after more than two years of
disputes over tax payments and recovery costs, opening the way
for the field’s expansion, estimated by KazMunaiGaz to cost
$14.5 billion in 2010. The Oil and Gas Ministry plans by July to
agree with Russia on creating a joint venture at the Orenburg
plant in Russia, which imports gas from Karachaganak, adding
that the agreement must “take into account” the building of
the Kazakh facility and the oilfield expansion, it said on its
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
