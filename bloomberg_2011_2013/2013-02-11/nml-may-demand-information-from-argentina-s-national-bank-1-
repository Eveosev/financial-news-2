A hedge fund that holds defaulted
Argentine bonds won approval from a federal judge in New York to
demand information about the nation’s assets worldwide from
Banco de la Nacion Argentina, to help it understand Argentina’s
“financial circulatory system.”  U.S. District Judge  Thomas Griesa  said Elliott Management
Corp.’s NML Capital may go forward with a subpoena requiring BNA
to produce documents “relating to any assets or accounts
maintained at BNA by Argentina or for Argentina’s benefit, any
debts owed by BNA to Argentina and transfers into or out of
Argentina’s accounts” as part of NML’s attempts to seize assets
to pay what it’s owed on the bonds.  Griesa overruled BNA’s objection that complying with the
subpoena would violate Argentine law and the laws of Spain,
Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Panama, Paraguay, the Cayman Islands and
Uruguay. Griesa said he will schedule a hearing to determine
what additional steps need to be taken.  “The court finds that with the exception of Uruguay,
complying with this court’s orders would not violate the various
countries’ laws,”  Griesa said in a Feb. 8 opinion. “However,
even if disclosure violated the foreign countries’ laws, as in
the case of Uruguay, this court still orders disclosure.”  Argentina defaulted on a record $95 billion in sovereign
debt in 2001. Griesa is overseeing lawsuits filed by investors
in the U.S. seeking to collect on the defaulted bonds.  The case is NML Capital 03-cv-8845, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
