Nigeria’s naira gained the most this
month after the central bank increased the amount of dollars it
sold at an auction.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer climbed 0.1
percent, the most on a closing basis since Jan. 31, to 157.25
per dollar as of 3:35 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital.  The Central Bank of Nigeria sold $180 million to lenders,
it said in an e-mailed statement, the highest in three auctions.
The regulator sells dollars on Mondays and Wednesdays to support
the naira.  “The increase in dollar supply was a boost to the
naira,” Sewa Wusu, a currency analyst at Lagos-based Sterling
Capital Ltd., said by phone today.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
in January 2022 fell 4 basis points to 10.88 percent in the
secondary market, according to today’s data compiled on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Borrowing costs
on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021 were
little changed at 4.179 percent today.  Ghana’s cedi appreciated 0.3 percent to 1.9005 per dollar
in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
