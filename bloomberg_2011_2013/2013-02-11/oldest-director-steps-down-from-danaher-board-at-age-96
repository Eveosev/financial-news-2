Mortimer Caplin , the former
commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service who became the
oldest director of a Standard & Poor’s 500 Index company, plans
to step down from the board of Danaher Corp in May.  Caplin, 96, told the company Feb. 8 that he won’t stand for
re-election at the May 7 annual meeting, and will step down
after the session, the Washington-based provider of measurement
and diagnostic equipment said today in a regulatory filing.  A founder of Caplin & Drysdale, a Washington law firm, he
graduated from the University of Virginia in 1937 with a
bachelor’s degree, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
IRS commissioner from 1961 to 1964, he joined the Danaher board
in 1990 and was identified in a 2011 Bloomberg article on
corporate directors as the oldest in the U.S.  “It’s a question of competence,” Caplin said in an
interview for that story. “In a way, I feel age is
irrelevant.”  Matt McGrew , vice president, investor relations at Danaher,
didn’t respond to a request for comment. Caplin didn’t
immediately respond to a message at the law office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
