Detroit Tigers pitcher  Justin Verlander  will skip next month’s World Baseball Classic, leaving
the U.S. team without the American League’s top two pitchers.  Verlander, 29, told reporters about his decision at the
Major League Baseball team’s spring training camp today in
Lakeland, Florida, according to a report on the Tigers’ website.  Verlander was runner-up to Tampa Bay’s  David Price  in
voting for last season’s American League Cy Young Award, given
to the league’s best pitcher. He threw  266 2/3 innings  last
year, including his final start on Oct. 24 in Game 1 of the
World Series, and finished the regular season with a 17-8 record
and a 2.64 earned-run averaged. Verlander won the Cy Young and
the AL’s Most Valuable Player award in 2011.  Price previously said he would skip the tournament. The
U.S. team is schedule for opening pool play March 8-10 at Chase
Field in Phoenix.  To contact the reporter on this story:
