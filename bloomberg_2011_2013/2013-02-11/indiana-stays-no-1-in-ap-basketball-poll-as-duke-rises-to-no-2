Indiana University, which lost to
Illinois before beating then-No. 10 Ohio State yesterday, held
on to its No. 1 ranking in the  Associated Press poll  of menâ€™s
college basketball teams.  It was the first time in six weeks that a school retained
the top ranking and comes after a weekend in which four of the
five highest-ranked teams lost at least one game.  The  Hoosiers  received 26 first-place votes and 1,559 points
from a nationwide media panel, just ahead of Duke, which
received 20 first-place votes and 1,515 points.  The  Blue Devils , who were No. 1 twice earlier this season,
were the only top-five team to avoid a loss. Duke beat Boston
College 62-61 to move up two spots to No. 2 in the poll. No. 3
is the the University of Miami, which beat Duke last month in
Coral Gables, Florida, and is undefeated in the Atlantic Coast
Conference.  Michigan, which lost an overtime game at Wisconsin
Saturday, fell one place to fourth, while Gonzaga moved up one
spot from sixth to complete the top five.  Syracuse, Florida, Michigan State, Arizona and Kansas State
complete the top 10. They are followed by Butler, Louisville,
Ohio State, Kansas, Georgetown, Pittsburgh, Oklahoma State,
Marquette, New Mexico and Wisconsin.  Notre Dame, Memphis, Oregon, Colorado State and Kentucky
complete the poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
