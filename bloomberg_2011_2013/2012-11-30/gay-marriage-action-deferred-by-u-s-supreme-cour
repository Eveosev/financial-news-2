The U.S. Supreme Court deferred
saying whether it will consider gay marriage for the first time,
taking no action on 10 pending appeals touching on the rights of
same-sex couples.  The justices, who were scheduled to consider the appeals
during a private conference today, released a list of orders
that made no mention of the gay-marriage cases while granting
review to two other cases. The court will have another
conference in a week and may make an announcement after that
session.  The court is weighing whether to hear clashes over the U.S.
Defense of Marriage Act, which blocks gays from receiving
federal marriage benefits, and a  California  ballot measure that
outlawed same-sex nuptials there in 2008.  Advocates on both sides say the court is all but certain to
review the Defense of Marriage Act, which two federal appeals
courts have said is unconstitutional. Less clear is whether the
justices will take up the potentially more sweeping fight over
Californiaâ€™s Proposition 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
