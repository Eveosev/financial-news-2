The  U.S. Senate  passed a bill that
would allow more state and local government employees whose
agencies receive federal funding to participate in partisan
politics.  The measure, passed by unanimous consent, would make
changes to the Hatch Act, a law that prohibits some government
workers from seeking partisan public office if their employment
relates to an activity at least partly financed with federal
funds. Democrat  Daniel Akaka  of  Hawaii , who’s retiring at the
end of this term, introduced the legislation in March.  Increased federal  government spending  for state and local
law-enforcement, first-responder and health-care agencies after
Sept. 11, 2001, has meant that more employees are prohibited
from running for partisan office, even when those public
positions are unpaid.  The bill also would change the penalties for violating the
Hatch Act. The Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal
investigative and prosecutorial agency, would be given a range
of options for punishment.  The measure would allow state and local government
employees to run for office unless their entire salary is paid
by the U.S. government, allowing hundreds of thousands of
workers to run for office, according to testimony from Carolyn Lerner, head of the Office of Special Counsel.  The legislation would take effect 30 days after the bill’s
enactment.  The House hasn’t acted on related measures.  The bill is S. 2170.  To contact the reporter on this story:
