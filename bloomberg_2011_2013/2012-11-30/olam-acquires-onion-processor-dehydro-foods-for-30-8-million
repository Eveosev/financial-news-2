Olam International Ltd. (OLAM) , the
commodity trader fighting allegations it may collapse, acquired
a processor of dehydrated onions and herbs in  Egypt  for $30.8
million.  The cost to buy Dehydro Foods Ltd. includes an estimated
$3.5 million for net working capital, Singapore-based Olam said
in a stock exchange statement today. The investment is expected
to deliver a 28 percent margin in Ebitda, it said.  “The consideration was arrived on a negotiated basis
taking into account the historical performance and the prospects
of the business,” Olam said in the statement. “The
consideration shall be discharged on a cash basis from internal
accruals and shall be paid at completion.”  The transaction is part of Olam’s “strategic thrust” to
become the leading supply chain partner to its major global
customers, the company said in the statement. The investment is
expected to be immediately earnings accretive to Olam, according
to the statement.  Olam, the world’s second-largest rice trader, is suing
 Muddy Waters  and the researcher’s founder  Carson Block  for
defamation following comments initially made by Block on Nov. 19
in London questioning Olam’s accounting methods and debt level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
