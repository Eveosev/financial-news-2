Honduran soldiers confiscated a
record 15 tons of illegal narcotics hidden underground as the
Central American nation becomes the biggest destination for
South American drug flights.  The drugs, likely cocaine or methamphetamines, were found
yesterday by a counter-narcotics team investigating a hidden
underground storage room on a farm in the country’s northern
Yoro region, said Melvin Duarte, a spokesman for the Public
Prosecutor’s Office in the capital, Tegucigalpa.  “Investigators have said that much of the drugs came in
various shipments out of  Venezuela ,” Duarte said. The narcotics
are being tested today by a toxicology lab, he said. The total
haul may have a street value of $450 million, newspaper La
Prensa reported.  Honduras, which has one of the highest per capita murder
rates in the world, is a landing spot for an estimated 79
percent of cocaine-smuggling flights departing  South America ,
according to a  March report  by the U.S. State Department.  The U.S. military and Drug Enforcement Administration have
been assisting the Honduran government to reduce drug-
trafficking through programs including the Central American
Regional Security Initiative, which began in 2008. The U.S. did
not assist in the operation yesterday, Duarte said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
