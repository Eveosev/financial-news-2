SandRidge Energy Inc. (SD) , the energy
producer that’s lost 28 percent of its value this year, should
allow its shareholders to vote on replacing the company’s
directors, clearing the way for the company to be sold, said
hedge fund manager  Dinakar Singh .  Singh, whose TPG-Axon Management LP increased its stake in
SandRidge to 6.5 percent from 6.2 percent on Nov. 13, asked the
board to set a date for a shareholder vote to remove directors.
He wants rule changes that would allow the directors to be
replaced at once and removed without cause, he said today in a
letter to the board.  TPG-Axon and Mount Kellett Capital Management LP, which
owns 4.5 percent of SandRidge, have called for the company to
put itself up for sale, fire Chief Executive Officer Tom Ward
and add outside directors. The stock has  declined  78 percent
from its IPO value in November 2007, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  “An outright sale of the company is the most realistic
path to restoring the shareholder value that has been
destroyed,” Singh wrote.  Greg Dewey, a spokesman for Oklahoma City-based SandRidge,
said the company is reviewing the letter.  Airing Out  A formal vote request is likely to increase communication
between SandRidge and its shareholders and “air out” the
issues that the company can address, Duane Grubert, an analyst
at Susquehanna Financial Group in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said in
an interview.  “Otherwise, you have very private pro-and-con discussion
going on behind the scenes,” said Grubert, who rates
SandRidge’s shares the equivalent of a buy and doesn’t own any.  Ward founded SandRidge after leaving  Chesapeake Energy
Corp. (CHK)  in 2006 and owns 5.2 percent of the company’s shares,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  SandRidge began as a gas producer and switched to exploring
for oil when natural gas prices fell in 2008. The company said
Nov. 8 it would sell its Permian Basin property in  Texas  to
raise money to drill its 1.8 million acres in the Mississippian
Lime field in Oklahoma and  Kansas .  The company “bet the ranch,” by acquiring far more
acreage than it can realistically develop, Singh said. “As a
result, funding has become a constant drama in recent
quarters.”  High Costs  SandRidge is burdened by high overhead costs and overpays
Ward, Singh wrote. SandRidge paid Ward $67.3 million in 2008 to
compensate him for personal investments he made in the company’s
gas wells, according to company filings.  A third shareholder, Prem Watsa, CEO of  Fairfax Financial
Holdings Ltd. (FFH) , increased his stake in SandRidge to 10.4 percent
and praised Ward in a Nov. 19 interview as “one of the best
operators in the business.”  SandRidge adopted a shareholder rights plan Nov. 19 that
will allow existing shareholders to buy more stock at a discount
if an outsider tries to gain control of the company, making a
takeover more difficult.  SandRidge rose 3.2 percent to $5.85 at the close in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
