A  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  affiliate
agreed to buy Apple REIT Six Inc., a real estate investment
trust focused on hotels, in a $1.2 billion deal as the private-
equity firm expands its hospitality holdings.  The price includes transaction costs and debt, Apple REIT
Six said in a statement today. The acquirer is BRE Select Hotels
Corp., an affiliate of Blackstone Real Estate Partners VII.  Blackstone, based in  New York , has been buying lodging
properties from lower-priced chains to luxury hotels. Earlier
this year it agreed to purchase the Motel 6 chain from  Accor SA (AC) 
for about $1.9 billion, adding to investments such as Hilton
Worldwide and a stake in Extended Stay America Inc.  Apple REIT Six, which focuses on upscale, extended-stay and
select-service hotels, owns 66 hotels with 7,658 guest rooms
across 18 states. The properties operate under brands including
Courtyard by Marriott, Fairfield Inn and Hilton Garden Inn,
according to its website.  The deal is expected to be completed in the first half of
2013, subject to shareholder approval, Apple REIT Six said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
