Japanese  stocks  rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  capping its biggest monthly gain since
February, as the yen dropped after nation’s cabinet approved
additional stimulus ahead of next month’s election.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , which gets 79 percent of its revenue
outside Japan, reversed earlier losses to rise 0.8 percent as
the yen dropped.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , Japan’s largest construction-
machinery maker, rose 1.2 percent after industrial production
unexpectedly advanced. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and
Hitachi Ltd. gained after agreeing to merge their thermal-power
businesses.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 0.5 percent to close at
9,446.01 in  Tokyo , with trading volume 25 percent above the 30-
day average. The gauge has risen 0.9 percent this week and 5.8
percent this month on speculation  Japan ’s opposition will win
the Dec. 16 election and call for more monetary easing. The
broader Topix Index climbed 0.3 percent to 781.46.  “A weaker yen is giving the biggest support for shares,”
said Isao Kubo, a Tokyo-based equity strategist at Nissay Asset
Management Corp., which oversees about 5 trillion yen ($61
billion). “Investors are betting pressure will mount for more
monetary easing. You find it hard to buy the yen ahead of the
election, and the share market is sensitive to that and is being
bought when the yen drops.”  The Topix traded at 0.9 times book value today, compared
with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the
Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number less than one means that
companies can be bought for less than the value of their assets.  Second Stimulus  Japan’s cabinet approved a second round of fiscal stimulus
worth 880 billion yen using budget reserves as Prime Minister
 Yoshihiko Noda  tries to boost the economy before the election.
The yen declined against all of its 16 major counterparts,
lifting the earnings outlook for Japanese exporters.  Nissan gained 0.8 percent to 799 yen after falling as much
as 1 percent.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets 80 percent of
its sales outside Japan, rose 1.2 percent to 2,883 yen.  Machinery makers advanced after Japan’s industrial
production rose 1.8 percent in October from the previous month,
the Trade Ministry said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had
been expecting a 2 percent fall.  Komatsu advanced 1.2 percent to 1,847 yen.  Hitachi
Construction Machinery Co. (6305)  gained 1.6 percent 1,443 yen.  Futures on the  S&P 500  fell 0.2 percent today. The gauge
gained 0.4 percent yesterday as Senate Majority Leader  Harry
Reid  said Democrats were all on the same page on budget talks to
stave off the fiscal cliff, automatic tax increases and spending
cuts that will kick in next year unless a compromise is reached.
Stocks also gained on a report U.S. gross domestic product grew
at a 2.7 percent rate, beating estimates for a 2 percent rise.  Mitsubishi Heavy Merger  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Hitachi rose after agreeing
to merge thermal-power units with combined revenue of 1.1
trillion yen. Mitsubishi Heavy gained 3 percent to 383 yen and
Hitachi added 4.2 percent to 476 yen.  Mitsubishi Heavy also plans to merge its forklift
operations with Nippon Yusoki Co., according to a statement to
the Tokyo Stock Exchange yesterday. Nippon Yusoki surged 36
percent to 303 yen, leading gains on the Topix.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 0.2 percent
to 17.24, indicating traders expect a swing of about 4.9 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
