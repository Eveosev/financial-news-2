India’s rupee headed for its first
weekly gain since October as Moody’s Investors Service
maintained its stable outlook on the nation’s credit rating and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised local shares to overweight.  Moody’s said Nov. 26 that the Baa3 ranking, the lowest
investment grade, is supported by economic growth and investment
that’s more than emerging-market averages. The outlook for
 Asia ’s third-largest economy is improving, Goldman Sachs said in
a report yesterday. The global economy is in the best shape in
18 months, according to the latest Bloomberg Global Poll of
investors released this week.  “Sentiment seems to have turned for the rupee,” said J.
Moses Harding, executive vice president at IndusInd Bank Ltd. in
Mumbai. “There have been positives late in the month.”  The rupee advanced 1.8 percent this week to 54.5250 per
dollar as of 9:36 a.m. in Mumbai, paring its loss in November to
1.3 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
monthly drop is the sharpest among the 10 most-traded Asian
currencies excluding the yen. The currency strengthened 0.6
percent today.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange-rates used to price options, rose 41 basis points,
or 0.41 percentage point, this week to 9.91 percent. The rate
climbed 46 basis points today, paring its monthly increase to 11
basis points.  Growth Outlook  Foreign funds bought $247 million more Indian stocks than
they sold in the first two days of this week, taking monthly
inflows to $1.3 billion, exchange data show.  India ’s $1.8 trillion economy probably  expanded  5.3 percent
in the three months through September, according to the median
of 42 estimates in a Bloomberg survey before data due around 11
a.m. today. That would match the pace in the first quarter that
was the slowest since the three months through March 2009.
IndusInd predicts the central bank will begin lowering its
benchmark repurchase rate next year and Goldman said growth will
pick up to 6.5 percent in 2013 from 5.4 percent this year.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards were at 55.38 per dollar,
compared with 55.75 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were at 55.39
versus 55.78. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
