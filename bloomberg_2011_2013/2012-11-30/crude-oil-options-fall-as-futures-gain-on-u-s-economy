Crude oil options volatility dropped
for a third day as the underlying futures rose on signals that
U.S. economic expansion is accelerating.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 25.88 percent as of 4 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , down from 27.84 in the previous
trading session.  Crude oil for January delivery gained 84 cents to $88.91 a
barrel on the Nymex, the highest settlement since Nov. 19.
Futures gained 0.7 percent this week and 3.1 percent this month.  The MNI Chicago Reportâ€™s  business barometer  showed activity
in the U.S. grew in November for the first time in three months.
Democrats and Republicans discussed how to avoid the so-called
fiscal cliff, which would lead to more than $600 billion a year
in spending cuts and tax increases.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
January $92 calls, which rose 5 cents to 64 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,280 lots at 4:06 p.m. January $85 puts were the
second-most active, with 2,261 lots exchanged as they fell 30
cents to 56 cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 53 percent of the 33,686 lots traded.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, puts and calls were almost evenly
divided among the 113,049 lots traded.  January $80 puts were the most actively traded options
yesterday with 9,524 contracts. They declined 13 cents to 17
cents a barrel. February $102 calls rose 8 cents to 33 cents on
volume of 4,674 lots.  Open interest was highest for January $105 calls, with
45,804 contracts. Next were January $60 puts with 34,922 lots
and January $110 calls with 31,161.  To contact the reporter on this story:
