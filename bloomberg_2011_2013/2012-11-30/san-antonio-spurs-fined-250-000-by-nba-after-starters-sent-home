The San Antonio Spurs were fined
$250,000 by the National Basketball Association a day after four
of their starters skipped a game at the Miami Heat.  The NBA said in an e-mailed release yesterday that the move
violated league policy “against resting players in a manner
contrary to the best interests of the NBA.”  Among the players pulled from the lineup and sent back to
San Antonio were 36-year-old Tim Duncan, 30-year-old Tony Parker
and 35-year-old Manu Ginobili. The shorthanded Spurs kept the
game close until the final minute, ultimately falling 105-100
two nights ago to the defending champion Heat.  “The team did this without informing the Heat, the media
or the league office in a timely way,” NBA Commissioner David Stern said. “Under these circumstances, I have concluded that
the Spurs did a disservice to the league and our fans.”  San Antonio was playing its fourth road game in five nights
and finishing a six-game road trip. The Spurs tonight host
 Memphis , which has a league-best 12-2 record. The Spurs, 13-4,
are a half-game behind the Grizzlies in the Southwest division.  Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said he decided to rest players
for the game when the league schedule came out in July.  The nationally televised game at Miami posted a 1.7
overnight rating, according to TNT, which averaged a record 1.7
for the network’s NBA coverage last season. The NBA receives
about $930 million a year from  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN and ABC
and  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s TNT to show games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
