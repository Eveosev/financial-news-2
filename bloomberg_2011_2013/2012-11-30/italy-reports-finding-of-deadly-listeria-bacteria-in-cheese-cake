Italy found the deadly bacteria
listeria monocytogenes in gorgonzola and mascarpone cheese cake,
a notice to the European Union’s food alert system showed.  The bacteria was found during official checks in cheese
cake past its best-before date, and no action was taken,
according to a  notice  updated today on the EU’s Rapid Alert
System for Food and Feed. The cake was also distributed to
 Germany  and the Netherlands, the notice showed.  The finding follows detection of the pathogen earlier this
month in Italian raw-milk cheese.  Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that can
cause listeriosis, which can lead to brain infection and death.
An outbreak in the U.S. this year linked to imported ricotta
salata cheese contributed to at least  two deaths , according to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  To contact the reporter on this story:
