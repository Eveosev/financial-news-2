A Chinese court sentenced the leader
of a gang that paid a 17-year-old boy 22,000  yuan  ($3,533) for
his kidney to five years in prison.  Nine people involved in recruiting the boy and performing
the operation in April 2011 have “voluntarily” paid the
teenager’s family 1.48 million yuan in compensation, according
to the ruling posted yesterday to the  website  of the Chenzhou
Intermediate People’s Court in Hunan province.  The gang found the boy, a high-school student in Anhui
province, through an Internet chatroom, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported yesterday. The teenager bought an  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
iPhone and iPad with the money given to him for his kidney,
according to the report.  China has about 1.5 million people who need organ
transplants, Xinhua reported, citing the Ministry of Health.
Only about 10,000 transplants are performed each year, according
to the report.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
