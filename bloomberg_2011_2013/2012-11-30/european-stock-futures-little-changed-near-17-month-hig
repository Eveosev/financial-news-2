European stocks  fell, dragging the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index from a 17-month high, as U.S. consumer
spending unexpectedly declined and American lawmakers continued
to negotiate a deal on the  federal budget .  Bankia SA (BKIA) , the nationalized Spanish lender, slumped 25
percent for the biggest drop in the Stoxx 600. Bank of Ireland
Plc and  National Bank of Greece SA (ETE)  also declined more than 5
percent.  Gecina (GFC)  SA retreated 4.2 percent as Grupo PRA sold a
stake in Paris’s largest publicly traded office landlord.
Porsche SE increased 2.3 percent as carmakers rallied.  The Stoxx 600 dropped 0.2 percent to 275.78 at the close of
trading, erasing gains in the final hour as Spanish and
Portuguese bond yields rose. The measure has still climbed 0.9
percent this week and 2 percent in November as speculation grew
that Congress will agree on a U.S. budget deal that avoids the
so-called fiscal cliff. The index has climbed for six straight
months, the longest streak of gains in more than six years.  “There is tension coming back into the  bond market ,” said
 Arnaud Scarpaci ,  fund manager  at Montaigne Capital in Paris,
which oversees $221 million. “We’ve also had a disappointment
with the economic data out of the U.S. The market is
consolidating a bit.”  Spending by U.S. consumers unexpectedly declined and
incomes stagnated in October as superstorm Sandy kept some in
the Northeast from getting to work or from shopping at malls and
car dealerships. Purchases decreased 0.2 percent, the weakest
reading since May, after a 0.8 percent gain in the prior month,
Commerce Department figures showed.  Old Proposals  Congressional Republicans  complained that a budget plan
outlined yesterday by Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner  was
little more than a rehash of old proposals. This set the stage
for more contentious negotiations over the coming weeks to
prevent $607 billion in spending cuts and tax increases from
coming into effect at the start of 2013.  President  Barack Obama  visited a manufacturing plant in
Hatfield, Pennsylvania, today to emphasize his call for an
extension of George W. Bush-era tax rates for middle-income
households. Speaker of the House  John Boehner  said to reporters
in Washington yesterday that there’s been “no substantive
progress” in budget talks.  In Europe, the yield on Spanish two-year  government bonds 
rose six basis points to 2.86 percent, while Portugal’s climbed
four basis points to 4.03 percent.  German lawmakers approved Greece’s latest rescue package as
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  warned that a default in the
country where the European debt crisis began could trigger the
collapse of the euro. Legislators in Germany’s lower house of
parliament, or Bundestag, voted 473 in favor, with 100 against
and 11 abstentions.  National Indexes  National benchmark indexes declined in 11 of the 18 western
European markets. France’s  CAC 40 Index (CAC)  slipped 0.3 percent and
the U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. Germany’s DAX Index added
0.1 percent.  Bankia, the nationalized Spanish lender, slumped 25 percent
to 72 euro cents for the biggest drop in the  Stoxx 600. (SXXP)  Bank of
Ireland sank 5.1 percent to 11 euro cents. National Bank of
Greece lost 5 percent to 1.32 euros, the lowest price in more
than three months.  Gecina declined 4.2 percent to 84.99 euros, the biggest
retreat in almost two months, as Grupo PRA sold a 1.5 percent
stake for 83 euros a share.  Automakers Advance  Porsche, the maker of the 911 sports car, advanced 2.3
percent to 57 euros and  Fiat SpA (F) , the majority owner of Chrysler
Group LLC, gained 2.7 percent to 3.56 euros.  Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/)  advanced 3 percent to 61 pence as UBS AG
raised the U.K.’s second-largest homebuilder by volume to buy
from neutral.  HeidelbergCement AG (HEI)  rallied 2.3 percent to 41.79 euros, a
second day of gains. The world’s third-biggest maker of cement
was upgraded to overweight, the equivalent of buy, from equal
weight at Morgan Stanley, which named the stock as its top pick
in the cement business.  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC)  added 1.3 percent to
134.90 euros, the highest since March, as Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. upgraded the luxury-goods company to buy.  Other luxury-goods makers also climbed.  Christian Dior SA (CDI) 
gained 1.9 percent to 124.25 euros and Cie. Financiere Richemont
SA added 1.7 percent to 71.45 Swiss francs. Both stocks have
risen to the highest levels in at least two decades.  To contact the reporters on this story:
