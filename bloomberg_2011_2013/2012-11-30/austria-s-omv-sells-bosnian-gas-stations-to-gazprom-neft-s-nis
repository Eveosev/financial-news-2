--  Naftna Industrija Srbije AD (NIIS) , the
Serbian oil and gas company controlled by  OAO Gazprom Neft (GAZP) , said
it bought all 28 gas stations in Bosnia-Herzegovina owned by
 Austria ’s  OMV AG. (OMV)   The purchase from OMV BH d.o.o., a unit of the Austrian
refiner, “represents a step in the strategy of NIS’s regional
development” that includes the expansion of retailing in the
Balkans, the Novi Sad, Serbia-based company said in an e-mailed
statement. It didn’t disclose the purchase price.  The transaction, pending regulatory approval, will allow
NIS to expand sales of motor fuels as it tries to increase its
presence in neighboring markets including Bulgaria and Romania,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
