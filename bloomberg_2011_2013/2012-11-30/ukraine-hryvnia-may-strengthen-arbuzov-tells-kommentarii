Ukraine’s hryvnia may strengthen
against the dollar after the central bank forced exporters to
sell half of their foreign-currency revenue, the regulator’s
Governor, Serhiy Arbuzov, told the  Kommentarii  newspaper.  The hryvnia may strengthen to less than 8 per dollar,
Arbuzov said in an interview published today by the newspaper.
If that happens, the central bank will buy dollars on the market
more “actively”, he said, according to Kommentarii.  The hryvnia, which has lost 1.65 percent against the dollar
this year, traded at 8.1750 at 2 p.m. in Kiev compared with
8.1899 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  -- Editors: Andrew Langley, Balazs Penz  To contact the reporter on this story:
