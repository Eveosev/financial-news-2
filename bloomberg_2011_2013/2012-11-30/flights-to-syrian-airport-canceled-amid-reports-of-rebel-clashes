Damascus International Airport is
closed to flights today as government troops fight with rebels
on the main road leading to it, Al Arabiya television reported.  The clashes follow a communications blackout as Internet
and phone lines went down yesterday. Government officials have
blamed rebels for the shutdown, Arabiya said. Emirates Airlines
and EgyptAir are among carriers to cancel flights to Damascus.  Communications including cellular networks, landlines and
the Internet in many parts of  Syria  were cut yesterday, the
opposition Local Coordination Committees said in an e-mailed
statement. Renesys Corp., a Manchester, New Hampshire-based Web
monitoring company, said it was the most significant country-
wide outage since Egypt’s Internet was shut down amid violent
protests in January last year.  Syria’s civil war began in March last year and has left at
least 40,000 people dead, according to the U.K.-based Syrian
Observatory for  Human Rights , as rebels fight to oust the
government of President Bashar al-Assad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
