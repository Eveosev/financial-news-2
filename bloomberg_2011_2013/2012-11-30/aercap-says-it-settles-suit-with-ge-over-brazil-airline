AerCap Holdings NV (AER)  said it settled a
lawsuit against units of  General Electric Co. (GE)  over servicing
agreements relating to leases with the defunct Brazilian airline
Transbrasil SA Lineas Areas.  AerCap said in a statement today that it has settled the
lawsuit and withdrawn the complaint. Details of the agreement
are confidential, Schiphol, Netherlands-based AerCap said.  AerCap’s Irish unit sued GE Capital Corp. and GE Capital
Aviation Services in New York State Supreme Court in  Manhattan 
in February, accusing the units of Fairfield, Connecticut-based
General Electric of failing to inform the aircraft-leasing
company about a court case involving Transbrasil.  “Information exchanged since the initiation of AerCap’s
lawsuit has satisfied AerCap that GECAS did not commit fraud and
otherwise has a reasonable basis for the position that it did
not breach the standard of care owed under the servicing
agreements,” AerCap said. “GECAS was the servicer of aircraft
owned by AerCap and leased to Transbrasil. The GECAS servicing
relationship with AerCap ended in 2001.”  The airline had sued GE and AerCap in February 2001 to void
promissory notes issued in 1999 in connection with the leases of
two engines and an aircraft, according to the complaint filed in
 New York . GE lost an appeal of a 2007 judgment entered against
AerCap and other defendants, and Transbrasil asked Brazilian
courts to enforce the judgment, according to the complaint.  The settlement couldn’t be immediately confirmed in court
records. Daniel Whitney, a spokesman for GE Capital Aviation
Services, didn’t immediately respond to a voice-mail message
seeking comment on AerCap’s statement.  The case is AerCap Ireland Ltd. v. General Electric Capital
Corp., 650341/2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
