Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , anticipating a
return to profit in its current business year, said a plant it’s
building in Mexico that will also make cars for  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203)  is going to be larger than planned.  Mazda this month said it will make 50,000 small cars a year
for Toyota starting in 2015 at the Salamanca, Mexico, factory
under construction. The plant will be fully utilized and need
more than the planned 190,000 units of production capacity that
includes 140,000 Mazda vehicles, Chief Executive Officer Takashi Yamanouchi said in an interview at the Los Angeles Auto Show.  “As a strategic production location, total volume for the
Mexico operation will be larger than the combination of the
two,” Yamanouchi said Nov. 28, without elaborating. “I think
we’ll be able to make an announcement very soon.”  Mazda’s move into Mexico follows similar announcements by
Japan’s  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , which are all
seeking lower-cost production facilities to make small cars for
 North America . Unlike Toyota, Honda and Nissan, Hiroshima,
Japan-based Mazda imports all its vehicles sold in the U.S. from
Japan, after ending production of Mazda6 sedans in Michigan.  In addition to low production costs, Mexico is an
attractive location from which to export vehicles because it has
free trade agreements with 37 nations, Yamanouchi said.  The Salamanca plant is to produce Mazda2 and Mazda3 small
cars when it opens in fiscal 2014 as a joint venture with
 Sumitomo Corp. (8053)  Details of any expansion must be worked out
between the partners, he said.  Mazda in June 2011 said the plant would cost $500 million
and have capacity to make 140,000 vehicles a year, prior to the
50,000-unit increase for Toyota production. Toyota is investing
an undisclosed amount in the factory, Mazda said.  Small Toyota  A small Toyota model based on the Mazda2 subcompact will go
into production in 2015, the companies have said. That car “may
be a variant” of the Toyota Yaris,  Jim Lentz , president of
Toyota’s U.S. sales unit said Nov. 28 in an interview in Los
Angeles.  The automakers have only a contract production arrangement,
and there are no plans for equity ties from the project, both
Yamanouchi and Lentz said this week.  Mazda also plans to develop a successor to  Fiat SpA (F) ’s Alfa
Romeo Duetto Spider, based on its MX-5 Miata roadster. Details
of that project should be set by year end, Yamanouchi said.  “That should be very soon,” he said. “I had a very firm
handshake” from Fiat CEO  Sergio Marchionne  at the Paris Motor
Show in August, Yamanouchi said.  Mazda’s U.S. sales rose 8.8 percent this year through
October to 228,106. The company last month cut its operating
income target for the fiscal year ending March 2013 to 25
billion yen ($303 million), down from an earlier goal of 30
billion yen, in part because of reduced sales in  China .  It still expects net income of 10 billion yen, after four
consecutive annual losses. The company earned 5.74 billion yen
in the fiscal first half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
