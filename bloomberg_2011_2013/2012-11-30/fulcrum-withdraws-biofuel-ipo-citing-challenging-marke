Fulcrum BioEnergy Inc. (FLCM) , a closely
held company that produces ethanol from garbage, withdrew its
registration for a planned initial public offering due to
“challenging” market conditions, Chief Executive Office James
Macias said.  The company has arranged $175 million in private financing
to build its first commercial plant, Pleasanton, California-
based Fulcrum said today in a statement. The project was awarded
a $105 million U.S. loan guarantee in August and will process
household garbage into 10 million gallons (38 million liters) of
ethanol a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
