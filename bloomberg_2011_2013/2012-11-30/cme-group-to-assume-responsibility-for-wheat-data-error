CME Group Inc. (CME) , owner of the world’s
largest futures exchange, said it will “assume responsibility
for actual losses” stemming from an erroneous report on
deliveries related to wheat contracts.  An exchange report at 4 p.m. local time yesterday excluded
2,000 wheat-shipping certificates registered from two terminals
in Maumee,  Ohio , owned by The Andersons Inc., citing only 164
certificates, Chicago-based CME Group said today in a statement.
The report was corrected at 5:46 p.m.  The company said it “will assume responsibility for actual
losses associated with this reporting error” and “will
establish a claims process for customers.” Grain futures trade
on CME Group’s Chicago Board of Trade. The market closed
yesterday at 2 p.m. and opened at 5 p.m.  Chris Grams, a CME spokesman, declined to say whether
losses have been reported or the exchange had previously assumed
responsibility for losses stemming from reporting errors.  Wheat futures for March delivery dropped 2.3 percent to
$8.65 a bushel at 12:16 p.m. on the CBOT. The price dropped 0.6
percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
