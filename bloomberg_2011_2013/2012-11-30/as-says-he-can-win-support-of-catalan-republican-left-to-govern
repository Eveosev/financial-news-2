Regional President Artur Mas said he
aims to persuade the Catalan Republican Left, known as ERC, to
support his government and push jointly for a referendum on
independence from  Spain .  Mas said today he can envisage forming an alliance with ERC
after speaking to party leader Oriol Junqueras earlier this
week. Junqueras said he sees himself leading the opposition in
the regional parliament,  Onda Cero  radio station reported on its
website yesterday.  “This could work out,” Mas said at a televised press
conference dubbed into Spanish from Barcelona. “My impression
was good though it’s not ideal.”  Mas is looking to patch together a government to run
Spain’s biggest regional economy after losing 12 seats in a Nov.
25 vote that left him short of an outright majority. Junqueras
was the biggest winner in the election that Mas called two years
early following a wave of support for independence.  ERC, the traditional home of Catalan separatist voters,
more than doubled its representation. It claimed 21 seats,
making it the second-biggest party.  Mas said any government would be focussed on two
priorities: pushing for a referendum, which Spanish Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy  says would be illegal, and pulling
Catalonia out of recession while shoring up the social-security
system to protect poorer people.  “There is a clear call from across society in favor of the
right to choose,” Mas said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
