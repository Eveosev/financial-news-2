Chrysler Group LLC, the automaker
majority owned by  Fiat SpA (F) , will pay the remainder of $3,500-
per-worker bonuses that are due to hourly employees early,
according to a statement today.  Chrysler will make payments of $1,750 each to its roughly
26,200 employees represented by the  United Auto Workers  on Dec.
21, the  Auburn Hills , Michigan-based company said. The first
half of the bonuses was paid after Chrysler and the Detroit-
based union agreed to a national contract in October 2011.  Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  is hastening the
payments to workers after the Auburn Hills, Michigan-based
automaker last month confirmed its forecast of about $1.5
billion in net income for the full year. Workers otherwise would
not have been eligible for the second half of their ratification
bonuses until 2013’s first quarter, according to the statement.  “This waiver of the four-quarter requirement is made in
recognition of the tremendous contribution you have all made to
the performance of our facilities and to the revival of
Chrysler,” Marchionne, 60, wrote in a letter to employees.  Marchionne is also CEO of Turin, Italy-based Fiat.  To contact the reporters on this story:
