U.S. stocks closed higher, erasing
losses in the final 15 minutes of trading, as investors bought
shares before changes to MSCI Inc. indexes while investors
prepared for developments in budget negotiations over the
weekend.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index added less than 0.1 percent
to 1,416.25 at 4 p.m. after losing as much as 0.3 percent
earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
