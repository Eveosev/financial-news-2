There’s a head in a leather mask,
Weegee’s lurid crime scenes and a bone oozing marrow in a
plexiglass reliquary.  Warhol’s race riots and electric chair are here as well.  They’re all part of “Sinister Pop,” a new show at the
Whitney that reveals the darker preoccupations of the period.  Don’t miss the amusing “Dark and Deadpan: Pop in TV and
the Movies” just next door.  Runs through March 31 at the Whitney Museum of American
Art, 945 Madison Ave. Information: +1-212-570-3600;

shepherdesses sweep across the stage, as Marie has sweet dreams
with her Prince.  The Christmas tree magically grows from 12 to 40 feet and
eight polichinelles emerge from under Mother Ginger’s capacious
skirt -- all to the shimmering glory of Tchaikovsky’s music.  Runs through Dec. 30 at the David H. Koch Theater, Lincoln
Center. Information: +1-212-496-0600;  http://www.nycballet.com .  Saturday Night  Dave Matthews Band is at the Izod Center as they gear up

Riff,” and “Mercy.”  Reggae legend Jimmy Cliff opens.  At Izod Center, East Rutherford, New Jersey. Information:

Baba Brinkman puts evolutionary psychology to a practical test
with women he’s found on a dating site.  Well, maybe ovulation studies are not the best first date
ice-breakers.  Runs through Jan. 6 at Soho Playhouse, 15 Vandam St.
Information: +1-212-691-1555;  http://www.sohoplayhouse.com .  Then head over to Aquagrill for a  Manhattan  and some
saffrony bouillabaisse.  At 210 Spring St. Information: +1-212-274-0505.  Alternatively, hear Barber’s Violin Concerto played by the
Orpheus Chamber Orchestra and Anne Akiko Meyers, who’s bringing
her newly acquired 1741 “ex-Vieuxtemps” Guarneri de Gesu -- on
lifetime loan from a generous sponsor.  The violin has not been played in public in decades, so
now’s your chance.  Also on the program: Prokofiev’s Symphony No. 1 and
Mozart’s Jupiter.  At Carnegie Hall, 57th St. and 7th Ave. Information: +1-

Opera Orchestra perform Beethoven’s “Emperor Concerto.”  The composer wrote the heroic piece sheltering in his
brother’s basement as Napoleon shelled Vienna.  Also on the program, Sofia Gubaidulina’s “In tempus
praesens,” featuring the Met’s principal violinist David Chan,
and Stravinsky’s “The Firebird.”  At Carnegie Hall, 57th St. and 7th Ave. Information: +1-
212-247-7800;  http://www.carnegiehall.org .  Sunday Evening  Be touched with grace as you listen to a Chanticleer
Christmas at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  The a capella group sings “In dulci jubilo,” “Lo, How a
Rose E’er Blooming” and other favorites in front of the
Christmas tree aglow with candles, cherubs and silk-arrayed
angels.  The Neapolitan Nativity below has shepherds, flocks, the
three Magi, as well as townspeople and peasants drinking wine
and flirting.  Animals galore -- sheep, horses, goats, plus a camel and an
elephant -- enliven the eighteenth-century scene.  Performances at 6:30 and 8:30 p.m. at the Met, 1000 Fifth
Ave. Information: +1-212-570-3949;  http://www.metmuseum.org .  Make reservations for a special dinner in the Met’s Petrie
