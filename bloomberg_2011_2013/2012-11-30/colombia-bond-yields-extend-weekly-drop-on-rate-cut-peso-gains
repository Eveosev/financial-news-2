Colombia ’s peso bond yields posted
their biggest five-day drop since August after policy makers
unexpectedly cut borrowing costs last week.  The yield on the 9.25 percent peso-denominated bonds due in
May 2014 slid 19 basis points, or 0.19 percentage point, this
week to 4.95 percent, according to the central bank. The yield
was little changed today.  Banco de la Republica lowered the target lending rate by a
quarter-percentage point to 4.5 percent on Nov. 23, surprising
all except two of 33 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Policy
makers voted 4-3 to cut  borrowing costs  to the lowest in a year.  “We’re seeing that gains continued, although they are more
moderate, after the central bank’s rate cut,” said Jorge Cardozo, an analyst at Corredores Asociados brokerage in Bogota,
referring to the increases in bond prices.  Colombian congressional committees approved legislation
yesterday that would cut the tax on foreigners’ profits on local
bond holdings to 14 percent from 33 percent. The bill still
needs to be approved by the full Lower House and the Senate to
become law.  “The market lately has also been pricing in the impact of
the reform, but until it’s realized, we won’t be seeing major
gains,” Cardozo said in a telephone interview.  The peso was little changed at 1,814.83 per  U.S. dollar . It
has rallied 6.8 percent this year and 1 percent in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
