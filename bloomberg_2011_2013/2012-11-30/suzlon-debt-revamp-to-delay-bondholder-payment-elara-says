Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL)  bondholders will
get paid after Indian lenders, which agreed to revamp about $2
billion of the wind-turbine makers debt this week, Elara Capital
Plc said.  “It is unlikely that Suzlon will be able to pay any cash
upfront to the bondholders” of its 2012 convertible notes
because lenders led by the  State Bank of India  reduced the value
of Suzlon’s liabilities by $182 million, Rosita D’Souza, a
Singapore-based credit analyst for Elara, said in a note to
clients today.  Suzlon, which defaulted on those bonds last month, is
expecting to get a combined $260 million from the sale of its
Chinese manufacturing business and a payment from customer
 Edison International. (EIX)  That money will go to Suzlon’s secured
lenders in  India  first, D’Souza said.  The Pune-based manufacturer also wasn’t able to pay the
first coupon on its 2016 note last month. Failure to pay any
debt allows holders of Suzlon’s 2014 and 2016 notes to seek
immediate payment on an additional $311 million in liabilities,
offer documents show.  “It’s highly likely that the cross-default clause may be
triggered,” D’Souza wrote in the note.  Suzlon will probably try to restructure all its outstanding
convertible bonds at one go, she said. A partial rollover into a
new unsecured five-year note for those holding the 2012 bonds,
reducing the strike price and introducing a coupon for the 2014
notes are options that may be considered, D’Souza wrote.  Suzlon has gained 27 percent since Nov. 26 when its secured
lenders voted to allow it to restructure about 80 percent of its
140 billion rupees ($2.56 billion) of debt. The shares rose 5.9
percent to 19.65 rupees, the highest in almost five months, as
of 1:38 p.m. in Mumbai trading today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
