Following is the text of
 Canada ’s National Economic and Financial Accounts for
the third quarter as released by  Statistics Canada .  Real gross domestic product (GDP) rose 0.1% in the third
quarter, slowing from the 0.4% growth in the second quarter. The
slower pace of growth was the result of declines in exports and
business investment. Final domestic demand grew 0.4%. On a
monthly basis, real GDP by industry was unchanged in September.  Exports fell 2.0% in the third quarter, the largest decline
since the second quarter of 2009. Imports rose 0.4%, the fourth
quarterly increase in a row. Non-farm business inventories
increased $12.0 billion.  Business investment in non-residential structures and in
machinery and equipment decreased 0.6%, following consecutive
quarterly increases that began in the third quarter of 2009.  Residential investment declined 0.8%, as housing resale
activity slowed considerably.  Household spending on goods and services advanced 0.9%, the
fastest pace so far in 2012. Purchases of goods were up 0.8%,
while services increased 1.1%.  Final domestic demand expanded 0.4%, following six quarters
of similar gains.  The output of  service industries  increased 0.4% in the
third quarter, while goods production declined 0.6%. The public
sector as well as the finance and insurance, utilities,
transportation and retail trade sectors were the main
contributors to growth in the quarter. Mining and oil and gas
extraction (-2.0%) and, to a much lesser extent, manufacturing
and construction were the main sources of the decline.  Oil and gas extraction fell 1.4% as both crude oil and
natural gas production declined. Support activities for mining
and oil and gas extraction fell 6.8%, as both drilling and
rigging services declined. Mining excluding oil and gas
extraction (-2.8%) was also down in the third quarter, as
production declines at potash and at copper, nickel, lead and
zinc mines offset increases in coal mining.  Expressed at an annualized rate, real GDP expanded 0.6% in
the third quarter. By comparison, real GDP in the  United States 
grew 2.7% in the third quarter.  Exports fall  Exports of goods and services declined 2.0% in the third
quarter. This was the largest quarterly decrease since the
second quarter of 2009.  Exports of goods fell 2.1%. Energy products (-6.4%) and
 consumer goods  (-3.7%) contributed the most to the decrease.  Exports of industrial machinery, electronic and electrical
equipment, and aircraft and other transportation equipment and
parts were also down. However, motor vehicles and parts (+1.1%)
posted a fifth consecutive quarter of growth.  Exports of services declined 1.3%, as all categories of
services fell except for travel services (+0.1%).  Imports increase for the fourth quarter in a row  Imports of goods and services rose 0.4% in the third
quarter, as imports of services (+1.6%) outpaced goods imports
(+0.2%). Imports recorded a fourth quarterly increase in a row.  Imports of basic and industrial chemical, plastic and
rubber products (+4.7%) recovered in the third quarter,
contributing the most to the increase in goods imports. Metal
and non-metallic minerals products (+2.7%), and energy products
(+1.4%) were also significant contributors to the increase.  Most of the other major categories of imports declined.
Imports of aircraft and other transportation equipment and parts
fell 7.9%, while imports of motor vehicles and parts were down
2.0%. Imports of consumer goods also declined, led by paper and
published products (-3.7%).  Among service imports, travel services grew 1.2%, a third
consecutive quarterly increase. Transportation services (+3.9%)
and commercial services (+0.8%) also rose after second-quarter
declines.  Lower business investment in engineering structures  Business investment in non-residential structures fell 1.1%
in the quarter, as investment in engineering structures declined
1.9%. Investment in non-residential buildings increased 1.3%,
the fourth quarterly gain in a row.  Business investment in machinery and equipment grew 0.1%.
Outlays on industrial machinery and equipment grew 1.2%, the
fourth successive quarter of growth. Purchases of other
electrical and electronic machinery and equipment (+3.2%) were
also higher.  Nevertheless, there were widespread reductions in purchases
of machinery and equipment. In particular, computers and
computer equipment fell 2.1%.  Demand for housing lessens  Business investment in housing fell 0.9% in the third
quarter, after a 0.1% decline in the previous quarter. This
decrease was the result of a 10.7% decline in ownership transfer
costs as housing resale activity slowed considerably.  In contrast, renovation activity increased 0.9%, recovering
from the 1.3% decline in the second quarter. New housing
construction increased 1.6%, half the pace of the average 3.2%
growth over the previous five quarters.  Business inventories accumulate  Non-farm business inventories rose $12.0 billion in the
third quarter.  Manufacturers’ inventories of durable goods increased $3.2
billion. Wholesalers accumulated $3.0 billion of durable goods
in the third quarter, while retailers added $3.3 billion. There
was a large increase in motor vehicle inventories.  Farm inventories also accumulated in the third quarter,
especially livestock.  Consumer spending strengthens  Household spending on goods and services advanced 0.9% in
the third quarter, the strongest quarterly increase since 2010.
Consumers increased spending on goods by 0.8%, while services
grew 1.1%.  Household spending on durable goods grew 1.4%, followed by
semi-durable (+0.8%) and non-durable goods (+0.5%).  Transport purchases grew 1.2%, as vehicle purchases
increased 2.3% after declining 3.3% in the previous quarter.
Spending on transport services rose 1.5%.  Consumer purchases of furnishings, household equipment and
other goods and services related to the dwelling and property
increased 0.3%, after a decline of 0.4% in the previous quarter.  Spending on clothing and footwear increased 0.7%, after a
decline of 1.1% in the previous quarter.  Consumer spending  on
recreation and culture rose 0.6%, following two consecutive
quarterly declines.  Economy-wide income expands  Nominal GDP increased 0.7% in the third quarter, over three
times the pace of the previous quarter.  Compensation of employees rose 1.1%, which was less than
the second-quarter pace of 1.3%. Wages in goods-producing
industries advanced 1.0%, following a 1.9% increase in the
second quarter. Wages in service-producing industries grew 1.2%-
-close to the second-quarter pace.  The net operating surplus of corporations rose 1.1% in the
third quarter, following a decline of 4.4% in the second quarter.
Net operating surplus of non-financial corporations increased
0.7%, while that of financial corporations increased 4.5%.  Household saving declines  Household final consumption expenditures (in current
dollars) grew 1.0%, while household disposable income grew 0.8%.
The household saving rate was 3.9% in the third quarter, down
from 4.2% in the second quarter.  The  household debt  service ratio, defined as household
mortgage and non-mortgage interest paid divided by disposable
income, was 7.4% in the third quarter. This ratio was similar to
that of the previous two quarters, but lower than the average
rate of 7.6% recorded in 2011. This signifies that the servicing
of household debt now requires less household disposable income
than in 2011.  The national saving rate was 5.1%, compared with 5.5% in
the previous quarter. National disposable income increased 0.5%,
the slowest growth since the second quarter of 2009. The third-
quarter slowdown was mostly the result of reduced corporate and
household savings.  Improved terms of trade increase purchasing power  Canada’s real gross domestic income, a measure of
purchasing power, increased 0.6% in the third quarter. Canada’s
terms of trade, which measures export prices relative to import
prices, increased 1.2%.  The price of goods and services produced in Canada rose
0.6%, after declining 0.2% in the previous quarter. Export
prices fell 0.9%, while import prices declined 2.1%.  The price of final domestic demand rose 0.3%, following a
0.4% growth in the second quarter.  Gross domestic product by industry, September 2012  Real GDP was unchanged in September, after edging down 0.1%
in August. Declines were recorded in wholesale trade, mining and
oil and gas extraction, the arts and entertainment sector, and
utilities. The declines were offset by increases in the finance,
insurance and real estate sector, in the public sector, and in
professional and transportation services.  Wholesale trade fell 1.1% in September, mainly as a result
of declines in the wholesaling of personal and household goods
as well as motor vehicles and parts.  Mining and oil and gas extraction declined 0.4% in
September. Metal ore mining decreased 3.3% as a result of
declines in output at copper, nickel, lead and zinc mines as
well as at gold and silver ore mines. Non-metallic mineral
mining declined 2.1% as a result of decreases in output at
potash mines.  Oil and gas extraction (-0.3%) decreased for a fifth
consecutive month, as a decline in crude petroleum production
outweighed an increase in natural gas extraction. Maintenance
activities at some crude petroleum facilities affected crude oil
output in September. In contrast, support activities for mining
and oil extraction rose 2.5% as a result of an increase in
drilling and rigging services.  Construction grew 0.1% in September. An increase in
residential building construction more than offset the declines
in non-residential building and engineering construction.
Following four consecutive monthly declines, the output of real
estate agents and brokers rose 3.7% in September, as activity in
the home resale market increased.  The finance and insurance sector rose 0.2% in September on
the strength of increased volume of trading on the  stock
exchanges . Professional services grew 0.2%, mainly as a result
of increased legal services.  The public sector (education, health and public
administration combined) edged up 0.1% as a result of an
increase in education and health services and, to a lesser
extent, public administration.  The arts and entertainment sector declined 2.6% in
September, partly a result of a labour disruption that resulted
in the cancellation of pre-season games in professional hockey.  Manufacturing rose 0.1% in September, as the 0.6% increase
recorded by manufacturers of durable goods was partially offset
by lower manufacturing of non-durable goods (-0.7%).  Note to readers  For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal

statistics (such as personal expenditures, investment, exports,
imports and output) are calculated from volume measures that are
adjusted for price variations. Percentage changes for income-
based and flow-of-funds statistics (such as labour income,
corporate profits, mortgage borrowing and total funds raised)
are calculated from nominal values; that is, they are not
adjusted for price variations.  There are four ways of expressing growth rates for gross
domestic product (GDP) and other time series found in this
release.  1. Unless otherwise stated, the growth rates of all
quarterly data in this release represent the percentage change
in the series from one quarter to the next, such as from the
second quarter to the third quarter of 2012.  2. Quarterly growth can be expressed at an annual rate by
using a compound growth formula, similar to the way in which a
monthly  interest rate  can be expressed at an annual rate.
Expressing growth at an annual rate facilitates comparisons with
official GDP statistics from the United States. Both the
quarterly growth rate and the annualized quarterly growth rate
should be interpreted as an indication of the latest trend in
GDP.  3. The year-over-year growth rate is the percentage change
in GDP from a given quarter in one year to the same quarter one
year later, such as from the third quarter of 2011 to the third
quarter of 2012.  4. The growth rates of all monthly data in this article
represent the percentage change in the series from one month to
the next, such as from August to September 2012.  With this release of monthly GDP by industry, revisions
have been made back to January 2012. In the context of the
comprehensive revision to the Canadian System of National
Accounts, historically-revised data of monthly GDP by industry
are planned for release on January 31, 2013. These revisions
will extend back to January 2007 and will reflect conceptual,
classification and statistical improvements. For more

economic accounts ( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/nea-cen/index -
