OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) , the shipbuilder
controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , fell to a record low
after  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  canceled a contract for five
drillships it was expected to build.  OSX, based in Rio de Janeiro, fell 6.4 percent to 8.99
reais in Sao Paulo, the lowest since it started trading in 2010.
 Brazil ’s benchmark stock index fell 0.7 percent.  Petrobras, as the biggest producer in deep waters is known,
canceled plans to charter five drillships from  Ocean Rig UDW Inc (ORIG) 
because higher-than-expected production rates at deepwater wells
reduced its drilling equipment needs, the Rio de Janeiro-based
producer said yesterday.  OSX was expected to win the contract because it has the
only shipyard in Brazil with enough spare capacity to do the
job, Auro Rozenbaum, an analyst at  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) , said in a
telephone interview from Sao Paulo. OSX was also expected to get
part of the revenue from renting the vessels to Petrobras,
Rozenbaum said.  OSX’s press office declined to comment in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
