Russia , the world’s third biggest
 wheat exporter  last season, gathered 74.4 million metric tons of
grains as of Nov. 19, down 24 percent from a year earlier, the
Federal State Statistics Service said.  The harvest is before drying and cleaning, the service,
known as Rosstat, said in an e-mailed statement today. Farmers
harvested 95 percent a year earlier, it said.  The wheat crop was 39.7 million tons as of Nov. 19, down
from 59.4 million tons a year earlier, it said. Wheat yields
dropped to 1.86 tons a hectare (2.47 acres) from 2.37 tons a
hectare a year earlier, Rosstat said.  Sunflower seed output was 7.6 million tons, or down 10
percent from a year earlier, out of about 90 percent of the sown
area. The sugar-beet crop is 41.7 million tons, or 3.1 percent
smaller than a year earlier, with 95 percent of the area
harvested, Rosstat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
