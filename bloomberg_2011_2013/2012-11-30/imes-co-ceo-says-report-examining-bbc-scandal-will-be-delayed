New York Times Co. (NYT)  Chief Executive
Officer Mark Thompson, under scrutiny for the handling of a sex
scandal when he ran the British Broadcasting Corp., said the
results of a BBC inquiry into the matter have been delayed.  The report was expected to be submitted at the end of
November, though now that won’t happen until “some weeks
later,” Thompson said today in a memo to the Times staff.  The investigation has been a source of lingering
uncertainty for Thompson, who took charge of the New York Times
this month. He led the BBC when it canceled a segment by the
“Newsnight” program investigating claims that Jimmy Savile, a
popular BBC host, had sexually abused dozens of underage girls
over a period of decades. Thompson has said that he wasn’t
involved in the decision to scrap the program.  Nick Pollard, a former head of British Sky Broadcasting
Group Plc’s Sky News, is reviewing the decision to cancel the
“Newsnight” segment as part of an internal probe by the  BBC .
Since those results of that inquiry are being closely watched,
Thompson said today that he would push back a series of town-
hall meetings until 2013.  “I know that there’s been considerable -- and quite
understandable -- interest in this topic inside as well as
outside the Times,” Thompson said in the memo. “I wanted to
address questions about it at the town halls once the inquiry
was out and all the facts were known.”  Thompson appeared before a closed-door internal inquiry at
the BBC this month to testify on what he knew about the news
report and why it was canceled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
