University of Southern California
assistant Monte Kiffin will resign following the Trojans’ bowl
game, stepping down from the team coached by his son following a
7-5 season.  Kiffin, a 72-year-old with 47 years of coaching experience
in the college and pro ranks, is leaving to pursue opportunities
in the  National Football League , the school said yesterday on
its website.  “I wanted to make this announcement now so that our
players who are preparing for the bowl game and our recruits who
will be visiting campus are aware,” Kiffin said in a statement
posted yesterday on the Los Angeles school’s  website.   USC lost four of its last five games after entering the
season ranked third in the coaches’ poll.  Kiffin spent 26 years coaching defense in the NFL,
including 13 as the defensive coordinator of the  Tampa Bay
Buccaneers . He’s been USC’s assistant head coach since 2010
after following his son, Lane, from the University of Tennessee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
