JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  isn’t required
to turn over portions of e-mails sought by U.S. regulators in a
probe of potential energy-market manipulation after a judge said
they are protected by attorney-client privilege.  U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson in Washington
yesterday denied a request by the  Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission  to force JPMorgan to provide unredacted copies of 25
e-mails. Robinson said she reviewed the documents and agreed
that the redacted portions are confidential communications with
JPMorgan’s lawyers.  FERC sued New York-based JPMorgan on July 2 to release the
e-mails in an investigation of possible manipulation of power
markets in California and the Midwest by J.P. Morgan Ventures
Energy Corp. The agency opened the probe last year after
complaints from California and Midwest grid operators that
JPMorgan’s bidding practices were abusive.  Mary O’Driscoll, a spokeswoman for FERC, didn’t immediately
return a call yesterday after regular business hours seeking
comment on the ruling.  The case is Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. J.P.
Morgan Ventures Energy Corp., 12-mc-352, U.S. District Court,
 District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
