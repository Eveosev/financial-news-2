ReneSola Ltd. (SOL) , the third-largest
maker of solar wafers, rose the most in almost five months after
third-quarter shipments exceeded its forecast.  ReneSola’s American depositary receipts gained 10 percent
to $1.30 at the close in  New York , the most since July 3. The
Jiashan, China-based company’s ADRs, each worth two ordinary
shares, have fallen 15 percent this year.  The company shipped 533 megawatts of solar wafers and
panels in the quarter, according to a statement today, compared
with its August forecast of 510 megawatts to 530 megawatts. It
expects to deliver as much as 675 megawatts in the current
quarter. ReneSola said 2012 shipments will be about 2.2
gigawatts, the low end of a previous range of 2.2 gigawatts to
2.4 gigawatts.  ReneSola’s loss was $78.6 million, or 91 cents an American
depositary receipt, compared with a loss of $8.2 million, or 9
cents, a year earlier, according to the statement. The loss
exceeded by 56 cents the average of two analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 15 percent to $218.2 million.  China ’s  GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800)  and LDK Solar Co.
were the largest makers last year of polysilicon wafers used in
solar cells by capacity, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
