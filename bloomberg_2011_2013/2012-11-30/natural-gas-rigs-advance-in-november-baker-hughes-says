Natural gas rigs in the U.S.
advanced in November for the first monthly gain in more than a
year with gas prices up almost 20 percent in 2012.  The count increased by eight this month as nuclear power
plant refueling and maintenance helped support a rally in gas
futures, which settled last week at the highest price since Oct.
31, 2011.  Gas rigs  fell by four to 424 this week after rising by
15 in the previous two weeks, according to oil-services company
 Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   Gas rigs declined for the previous 12 consecutive months as
energy producers moved away from gas plays to focus on more
lucrative gas liquids and oil drilling. The total dropped to 413
on Nov. 9, the lowest level since 1999.  “Natural gas market fundamentals steadily improved” in
August, September and October,  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) , the
second-largest natural gas producer in the U.S., said in a Nov.
28 presentation at the Jefferies Global Energy Conference in
Houston. The company has cut dry-gas drilling to “almost the
bare minimum” because of low prices this year, Jeff L. Mobley,
vice president of investor relations, said at the conference.  The total U.S.  energy rig count  dropped by six to 1,811,
Baker Hughes said.  Oil rigs  declined by two to 1,386.  ‘Newer Plays’  “We’ve sort of gotten to that level in oil rigs that makes
sense at the current price,” James Williams, president of WTRG
Economics in  London ,  Arkansas , said by telephone. “Any major
increases we see going into next year will come from newer
plays.”  Natural gas for January delivery slipped 8.7 cents to
settle at $3.561 per million British thermal units on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange. Prices are up 87 percent from this
year’s settlement low of $1.907 on April 19.  “It takes about $4 gas to really bring folks back into
exploration and we’re nearing that number,” Williams said. “We
are at or at least near the bottom for gas rigs.”  Crude for January delivery on the Nymex increased 84 cents
to settle at $88.91 a barrel. Oil prices are down 10 percent for
the year.  Texas gained the most rigs this week, adding two to 855.
New Mexico, North Dakota and  Wyoming  each lost two.  Rigs on land  dropped by four to 1,741.  Rigs in inland
waters  rose by one to 20, the highest level since August.
 Miscellaneous rigs , which primarily drill for geothermal energy,
were unchanged at one.  Vertical rigs  slipped by one to 508. Horizontal rigs
declined by four to 1,110.  The  offshore rig count  lost three to 50, and rigs in the
 Gulf of Mexico  slipped by two to 48.  Canadian energy rigs  gained for a third week, rising by 12
to 399, the highest since March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
