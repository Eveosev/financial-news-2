  VeriSign Inc. (VRSN) , the main manager of
the Internet-address database, plunged the most in a month after
a new contract letting the company continue to control Web sites
ending in .com limited price increases.  The  shares  dropped 13 percent to $34.15 at the close in New
York, the biggest decline since Oct. 26. Reversing a prior gain,
the stock has now lost 4.4 percent this year.  The U.S. Department of Commerce approved a contract renewal
through Nov. 30, 2018 that lets VeriSign maintain current
pricing of $7.85 per domain name registration, the Reston,
Virginia-based company said in a statement. VeriSign no longer
has the right to four price increases of as much as 7 percent
over the term of the contract, an option that was included in
the previous accord.  “A major growth driver has been removed,”  Shaul Eyal , an
analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., said in a research note today.
“With $1.4 billion in cash, VeriSign could be considering its
capital utilization plan which currently focuses on buybacks.”  In October and November, VeriSign repurchased 1.4 million
shares for $62 million, leaving $548 million remaining in its
current buyback program, Chief Executive Officer Jim Bidzos said
on a conference call with investors today.  “We’re extremely well positioned even without the pricing
terms in the previous agreement,” Bidzos said on the call.
“We’re still a growth company.”  Internet Addresses  As overseer of the registry, VeriSign translates the words
in an Internet address, such as www.bloomberg.com, into the
numbers that a computer server understands. VeriSign also works
with others that sell .com addresses. Those companies pay
VeriSign for the service that connects words to each correct
Internet address.  Under the new contract, which was negotiated between
VeriSign and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers, price increases will be limited to instances when there
are “extraordinary expenses related to security or stability
threats, and now require Commerce Department prior approval,”
VeriSign said in the statement.  Michele Jourdan , a spokeswoman for ICANN, didn’t respond to
calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
