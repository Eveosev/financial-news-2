Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone 5 and iPad Mini
tablet will start selling in  China  next month, adding the
world’s most populous country to the more than 40 markets where
the devices are already available.  The iPad Mini will be available Dec. 7 in China and the
iPhone 5 will be sold a week later, Cupertino, California-based
Apple said today in a statement that didn’t specify which
wireless carriers will offer the smartphone.  China contributed revenue of $23.8 billion in Apple’s
fiscal year ended in September, accounting for 15 percent of the
total and up 78 percent from the previous year, Chief Executive
Officer  Tim Cook  said last month on a conference call.
He projected at the time the iPhone 5 would arrive in China in
December.  The company introduced the smaller version of the iPad last
month to help keep customers from buying low-cost tablets from
competitors such as Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Google
Inc. It debuted the new version of the iPhone, responsible for a
third of profit, in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
