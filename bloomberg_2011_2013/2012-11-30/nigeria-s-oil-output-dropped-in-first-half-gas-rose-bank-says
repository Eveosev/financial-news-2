Crude output from  Nigeria ,  Africa ’s
top oil producer, fell 2.3 percent in the first half to 382
million barrels while gas production rose almost 25 percent to
34 billion cubic meters, a central bank report showed.  Daily crude and condensate output averaged 2.09 million
barrels a day compared with 2.14 million a year earlier, the
Abuja-based  Central Bank of Nigeria  said in its review of the
economy for the first six months of the year published on its
 website . An estimated 6.02 billion cubic metres of gas was
flared during the period, a 7.38 percent decrease year-on-year.  The drop in crude production was due to “increased
vandalism of oil pipelines and crude theft in the Niger delta
region,” the bank said yesterday in the report.  Nigeria is a major source of U.S. crude imports. Attacks by
armed groups targeting the oil industry cut more than 28 percent
of  output  from 2006 to 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The West African nation lost $7 billion to these
thefts in 2011, the central bank said. At least 150,000 barrels
a day are siphoned by criminal gangs,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s
Nigerian unit said in February.  Income from oil, representing 78 percent of total revenue,
climbed 13.8 percent year-on-year to 4.36 trillion naira ($27.7
billion) and exceeded the budget estimate by 31.3 percent, the
report showed.  “The increase in federally-collected revenue relative to
budget estimate was largely attributed to the rise in oil
revenue arising from high crude prices which averaged $115.05 a
barrel in the international market,” the central bank said.  Africa’s most populous nation of more than 160 million
people rely on oil for more than 95 percent of export earnings
and 80 percent of government revenue, the  Finance Ministry  said.  Shell,  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , Chevron Corp., Total SA and  Eni
SpA (ENI)  run joint ventures with state-owned Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp. that pump about 90 percent of the country’s
crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
