Indonesia ’s rupiah rose this week,
poised to snap its longest losing streak since December 2010,
after foreign funds pumped money into the nation’s debt at a
time when issuance it tailing off.  Government bonds  rallied.  The yield on the five-year notes reached an eight-month low
today after overseas investors added 1.61 trillion rupiah ($167
million) to their holdings of local-currency  sovereign notes 
this week, taking them to an all-time high of 268.44 trillion
rupiah, finance ministry data show. The government has sold 98.9
percent of its 2012 bond sales target with only one more auction
this year, Loto Srianita Ginting, director of  government
securities  at the debt management office, said yesterday.  “Optimism on the global economy spurs demand for emerging-
market debt, including Indonesia’s, which supports the rupiah,”
said Gusti Kahari, a foreign-exchange dealer at PT Bank Artha
Graha Internasional in Jakarta. “Bonds can rally further due to
the limited supply ahead.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.3 percent this week to 9,630 per
dollar as of 8:29 a.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg show. The currency fell 0.3 percent today
and 0.2 percent this month. The rupiah has declined for the past
six weeks.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, dropped five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, this week to 4.45 percent. It
rose five basis points today and dropped 55 basis points in
November.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent notes due July
2017 fell three basis points this week to 5.02 percent, the
lowest level since March 6, prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association show. The yield was little changed today and
retreated 42 basis points this month, the biggest decline since
January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
