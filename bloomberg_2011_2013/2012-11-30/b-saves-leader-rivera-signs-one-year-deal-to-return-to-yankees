The  New York Yankees  re-signed relief
pitcher  Mariano Rivera  to a one-year deal, all but ensuring
Major League Baseball’s career saves leader will end his career
in the Bronx.  Rivera, 43, will rejoin the Yankees for his 19th MLB
season, the team announced yesterday in an e-mail that did not
provide financial details. The contract is worth $10 million,
the Associated Press reported, citing an unidentified person
familiar with the negotiations.  A 12-time All-Star and the team’s closer since 1997, Rivera
missed most of last season after suffering a knee injury while
catching fly balls before a May game. He hinted during spring
training that the 2012 season might be his last, then vowed to
return after the injury.  Rivera has a 2.21 earned run average with a MLB-record 608
saves in his 18-year career, spent entirely with the Yankees. He
first signed with New York as an amateur free agent in 1990,
made his MLB debut in 1995 and won World Series titles with the
team in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2009. He was voted World
Series Most Valuable Player in 1999.  Rafael Soriano , who took over the closer’s role following
Rivera’s injury in May, finished the 2012 season with a 2.26 ERA
and 42 saves, third most in the American League. Last month, the
32-year-old Soriano turned down a $13.3 million qualifying offer
from New York to explore free agency.  Rivera took a cut in guaranteed salary from a $30 million
two-year deal for the past two seasons, the AP said. The team
also has signed deals in the last two weeks with starting
pitchers  Andy Pettitte  and  Hiroki Kuroda .  The Yankees won the American League East with a 95-67
record last season, and were swept in the AL Championship Series
by the  Detroit Tigers .  -- Editor: Rob Gloster  To contact the reporter on this story:
