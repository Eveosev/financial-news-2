Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney ,
the first foreigner who will head the Bank of England, likely
will deliver more speeches than his predecessor, if history is
any guide.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that Carney, 47, has averaged
almost twice as many speeches since his appointment in 2008 as
 Mervyn King , 64, the man he will replace on July 1 as leader of
the 318-year-old institution.  Carney’s selection “probably reinforces the shift to
greater BOE transparency,”  Citigroup Inc. economists  Michael Saunders  and Dana Peterson wrote in a report on November 27.
“As BOC governor, Carney has tended to give wide-ranging
speeches to communicate on the outlook far more frequently than
the BOE governor.”  In April 2009, Carney said the Bank of Canada would keep
its benchmark overnight rate at a record low  0.25 percent  until
the end of the second quarter the following year, provided the
inflation outlook remained stable. He raised the rate in June
2010 to 0.5 percent, and it’s now 1 percent.  Ben Bernanke  made a similar commitment in August 2011 when
he said the  Federal Reserve  would keep its policy rate near zero
until at least mid-2013, a date he later extended by two years.
The Bank of England hasn’t followed the Canadian model by
specifying the length of its low-interest policy. Its key rate
has been  0.5 percent  since March 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
