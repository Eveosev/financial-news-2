Swaps prices rose a fifth day for
thermal coal for next year’s loading from  Indonesia , the world’s
largest exporter of the fuel for electricity generation,
according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte.  The swap for Indonesian sub-bituminous coal with a
calorific value of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram in the first
quarter of 2013 gained 5 cents to $62.70 a metric ton on a net-
as-received basis as of yesterday, Ginga said in an e-mail today.
The December contract was unchanged at $61.45 a ton.  Contracts for coal with heating value of 5,500 kilocalories
a kilogram for shipment to South  China  in the first quarter were
unchanged at $84.30 a ton on a net-as-received basis, the energy
broker said. The swap for December remained at $83.85.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period.  About 60 percent of Indonesia’s coal is classified as sub-
bituminous. Higher moisture levels and a lower carbon content
reduce the heating value compared with better-quality stock.
Sub-bit coal has kilocalories of less than 6,100 per kilogram,
according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
