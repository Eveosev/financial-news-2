Asian currencies  gained for a second
week, approaching an almost 15-month high, as optimism that U.S.
lawmakers will resolve the nation’s budget deadlock supported
demand for emerging-market assets.  Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said Nov. 29 there’s been
progress in talks to avert $607 billion in spending cuts and tax
increases as President  Barack Obama  said this week he hopes for
an agreement before Christmas. India’s rupee had its best week
since June after Moody’s Investors Service affirmed its stable
rating outlook, Indonesia’s rupiah ended a six-week slump and
 China ’s yuan traded at a 19-year high. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan
Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the region’s 10 most-active
currencies excluding  Japan , advanced for a sixth month.  “The biggest driver is the U.S. fiscal situation,” said
Sean Yokota, the Singapore-based head of Asia strategy at
 Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB. (SEBA)  “If you look at a one-month
time horizon, we think they’ll reach a deal on the fiscal cliff,
so Asian currencies will probably continue to appreciate.”  The rupee rallied 2.3 percent from a week ago to 54.2650
per dollar in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The rupiah gained 0.6 percent to 9,594, and the ringgit
strengthened 0.7 percent to 3.0380. South Korea’s won rose 0.3
percent to 1,082.85.  Global investors added $827 million of new money into
emerging-market bond funds in the week through Nov. 28,
according to EPFR Global data. Foreigners were net buyers of
stocks in India, The Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand this
month. Investors bought an extra $167 million of sovereign debt
in  Indonesia  this week, government data showed.  India Ratings  “Optimism about the global economy is spurring demand for
emerging-market debt, including Indonesia’s, which supports the
rupiah,” said Gusti Kahari, a foreign-exchange dealer at PT
Bank Artha Graha Internasional in Jakarta.  The Asia Dollar Index has climbed 3.7 percent since May as
European leaders pledged to support Greece and amid signs of an
economic rebound in China. It touched 118.26 yesterday, the
highest level since Sept. 13, 2011. The gauge’s 60-day
historical volatility fell to 2.18 percent from 2.21 percent on
Nov. 23.  Moody’s said on Nov. 26 its outlook on India’s Baa3
sovereign credit rating remains stable as Asia’s third-largest
economy recovers amid strong investment gains. Gross domestic
product expanded 5.3 percent in the three months through
September, official data showed yesterday, matching the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  China PMI  China’s manufacturing  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was 50.6
in November, the National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing reported today.  The reading compares with the 50.8 median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 28 economists and 50.2 in October. A
number above 50 indicates expansion.  The  yuan  gained 0.04 percent this week to 6.2267 per
dollar, according to China Foreign Exchange Trade System. It
touched a 1993 high of 6.2223 on Nov. 27 and tested the upper
limit of its trading band on each of the five days.  “There’s pent-up demand for the yuan,” said Andy Ji, a
Singapore-based foreign-exchange strategist at  Commonwealth Bank
of Australia. (CBA)  The currency is also supported by a  trade surplus 
that has surpassed $180 billion this year, he said.  Elsewhere, the Philippine peso appreciated 0.4 percent from
a week ago to 40.895 per dollar before a public holiday
yesterday. Thailand’s baht was little changed at 30.69 per
dollar, as was Vietnam’s dong at 20,850. Taiwan’s dollar climbed
0.2 percent to NT$29.116 per dollar, its second weekly advance.  To contact the reporters on this story:
