Monaco  soccer club, majority owned
by Russian billionaire  Dmitry Rybolovlev , is looking at David Beckham as a candidate for the squad, Rybolovlev’s press
representative Sergey Chernitsyn said by e-mail.  “We’re always looking to add quality and experience to our
squad,” said Tor-Kristian Karlsen, Monaco’s chief executive
officer, according to the e-mailed statement from Chernitsyn.
“And Beckham, among other names we’re looking at, would fit
this profile.”  Beckham, 37, announced this month that the Dec. 1 Major
League Soccer championship game will be his last competitive
match for the Los Angeles Galaxy, sparking a race to sign the
former England captain.  “We’re an ambitious club and when a top name becomes
available, it’s natural that we are alert to the situation,”
Karlsen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
