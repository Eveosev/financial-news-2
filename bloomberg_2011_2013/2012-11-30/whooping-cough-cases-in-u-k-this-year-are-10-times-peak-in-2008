More than 7,700 whooping cough cases
have been reported in England and Wales this year, almost 10
times the number seen in the last peak year for the illness in
2008, the  Health Protection Agency  said.  The number of cases in October reached 1,614, bringing the
total for the year to 7,728 including 13 infant deaths, the
agency said today in an e-mailed statement. Almost 800 cases
were reported in 2008, according to the HPA. More than 80
percent of the 2012 cases are in people age 15 and older.  Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is a highly
infectious bacterial disease that spreads when an infected
person coughs and another person inhales the bacteria, the HPA
said. Infants have the greatest risk of severe complications and
death because babies don’t finish their vaccination regimen
until they are four months old. Pregnant women are being offered
the vaccine in the U.K. to confer some protection to newborns,
the HPA said.  Children fully inoculated against pertussis become more
susceptible to the illness over time as the vaccine’s protective
effect wears off, a U.S. study found. The vaccine, known as
DTaP, which also inoculates against diphtheria and tetanus, is
sold in the U.S. by  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  and  Sanofi. (SAN)   To contact the reporter on this story:
