The board that’s winding up failed
Icelandic lender  Kaupthing Bank hf  will be unable to provide
creditors with a date for when it plans to present a repayment
plan amid reports the central bank may block such a move.  “Due to uncertainties on the timing of any formal response
from the central bank of Iceland, it’s currently not possible to
provide a revised target launch date for a potential composition
proposal,” the bank said today in an e-mailed statement. The
bank continues “to move forward with preparations for a
composition proposal and is prepared to work closely with the
central bank of Iceland to address any concerns or questions
that may arise.”  Morgunbladid reported earlier this month, without saying
where it got the information, that the Reykjavik-based central
bank opposes composition agreements with the creditors of
Kaupthing, Glitnir Bank hf and Landsbanki Islands hf, which
could lead to bankruptcy proceedings. Finance Minister Katrin Juliusdottir said last month that debt settlements with
creditors of Iceland’s failed banks will increase an overhang of
offshore krona assets and stoke volatility in the currency.  Iceland’s parliament will support the central bank if it
chooses to block composition agreements, said  Helgi Hjorvar ,
chairman of the legislature’s economy and tax committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
