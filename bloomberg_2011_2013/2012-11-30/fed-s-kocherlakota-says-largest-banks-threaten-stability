Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis
President Narayana Kocherlakota said banks deemed “too big to
fail” pose a significant risk to financial stability, while
noting their threat has waned in recent years.  “The size of the TBTF problem has fallen over the past
couple of years but remains large,” Kocherlakota said today in
the text of prepared remarks given in  Boston .  More than four years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., U.S. regulators are still grappling with how to
reduce the risk taxpayers will need to bail out too-big-to-fail
financial firms in a crisis. Kocherlakota stressed the need to
develop a way to measure the problem, saying current approaches
are inadequate.  “How will we know if these changes in laws and regulations
are working?” Kocherlakota said at a conference at the Boston
Fed, referring to the overhaul required under the Dodd-Frank
Act. “There is no way to answer this question without a measure
-- or preferably a range of measures -- of the size of the TBTF
problem.”  The Minneapolis Fed chief didn’t comment on his outlook
for the economy or monetary policy. He is not a voting member of
the policy-setting  Federal Open Market Committee  this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
