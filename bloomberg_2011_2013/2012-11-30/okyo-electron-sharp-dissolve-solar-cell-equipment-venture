Tokyo Electron Ltd. (8035)  said it
dissolved a venture with Sharp Corp. to develop equipment used
for solar cell production.  The venture was dissolved today and the liquidation of the
company will be completed by the end of February, Tokyo Electron
said in a statement.  Tokyo Electron had a 51 percent stake in the venture, while
Sharp held the rest. The venture, set up in February 2008 for
operations for five years, developed equipment for use in making
thin-film solar panels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
