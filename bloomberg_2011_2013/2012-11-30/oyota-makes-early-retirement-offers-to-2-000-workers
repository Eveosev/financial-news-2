Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  said it’s making
early retirement offers to about 2,000 of its veteran U.S.
employees, most of whom work at its Georgetown,  Kentucky , plant.  Toyota is trying to manage the retirement of the workers
who will have at least 22 years with the company as of March 31,
2013. About 1,600 of those 2,000 employees work in Toyota’s
Georgetown factory, where about 6,600 workers make the Camry,
Venza and Avalon, according to an Oct. 30  statement  on the
company’s website.  “As we look at the next two years, a large contingent of
those team members in the U.S., particularly in Kentucky, will
be thinking about exiting the company due to 25 years of
service,” the company said in a statement to employees on Nov.
29. “This program offers a strategic approach to managing for
this condition.”  The automaker, based in Toyota City,  Japan , has built
plants in  North America  to expand its market share in the
region. Toyota captured 14.4 percent of the U.S. market this
year through October, an increase from 12.6 percent a year
earlier, according to researcher Autodata Corp. The Kentucky
factory, Toyota’s in North America, began production in 1988.  Workers eligible for the retirement program will receive
two weeks of pay for each year with the company, capped at 25
years, in addition to eight weeks’ pay. Workers who accept the
incentive package will retire in staggered intervals starting in
February, the company said.  The retirement offers were reported earlier by the
Lexington Herald-Leader in Kentucky.  To contact the reporter on this story:
