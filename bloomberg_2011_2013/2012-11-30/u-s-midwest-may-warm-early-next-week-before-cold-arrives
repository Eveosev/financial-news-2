Temperatures may rise into the 70s
Fahrenheit (20s Celsius) in Chicago, St. Louis and other parts
of the Midwest at the start of next week, then give way to
colder air by mid-December.  Weather from Dec. 10-14 will be more seasonal in St. Louis
and average about 3 degrees Fahrenheit below normal in Chicago,
according to  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group
LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  “Potent warming is forecast to start the new week across
the Midwest and East,” Rogers wrote in a note to clients today.
“By midweek, a cold front puts a dent in this warmth, but there
is an opportunity for a burst of stronger cold through the mid-
continent” closer to Dec. 10.  Colder-than-normal weather in the high-population areas of
the Northeast and the large cities of the Midwest increases
energy use for heating, which may push up natural gas and
heating oil prices. The period from November to March is when
the most fuel is used for heating in the U.S.  MDA Weather Services ’s outlook differs from Rogers’s,
predicting the cooldown won’t be as severe. MDA forecasts
seasonal levels will dominate the Midwest and temperatures will
remain about 3 degrees above normal along the East Coast during
the Dec. 10-14 period.  In  New York , the average normal temperature for Dec. 7 is
about 41 degrees, according to MDA in Gaithersburg, Maryland. In
 Boston , it’s 38; in Chicago, 30; Houston, 55;  St. Louis , 37;
Calgary, 21; Seattle, 41; and in Burbank, California, 54.  To contact the reporter on this story:
