Syrians who enter  Turkey  with their
passports are being given one-year residence permits in
provinces that donâ€™t border  Syria , Interior Minister Idris Naim Sahin said, according to the state-run Anatolia news agency.  The measure is designed to allow Syrian nationals, fleeing
violence at home, to remain in Turkey without a visa for longer
than three months, Hurriyet newspaper reported, citing the
Interior Ministry.  About 60,000 Syrians have entered Turkey with their
passports and rented houses, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan
said this week. More than 125,000 others are being sheltered at
refugee camps along the border.  To contact the reporter on this story:
