The New York Jets haven’t decided
whether backup quarterback  Tim Tebow  will be active for the
team’s Dec. 2 game against the Arizona Cardinals as he recovers
from cracked ribs, coach  Rex Ryan  said today.  Tebow, who suffered the injury in a Nov. 11 loss at the
Seattle Seahawks, will be monitored over the next two days and
his availability should be a game-time decision, Ryan said at a
news conference shown on the team’s website.  “He’s been limited, really very limited, in some of the
snaps,” Ryan said. “He does take a few offensive snaps. We’re
just tracking it. Could it be a game-time decision? It could
be.”  Ryan said the team also hasn’t decided whether  Greg McElroy 
would be active as a third option if Tebow does dress for the
game.  Tebow, 25, played the week after suffering the injury,
rushing twice and attempting a pass in a win against the St.
Louis Rams. Ten days later, the Jets learned that he had cracked
his ribs, though he still dressed as the No. 2 quarterback
behind  Mark Sanchez  for the team’s Nov. 22 loss to the  New
England Patriots  and was available for use if absolutely
necessary, Ryan said after the defeat.  Both the Jets and Cardinals are 4-7 entering the game at
MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.  New York is tied with the Buffalo Bills for last place in
the American Football Conference’s East Division, four games
behind the New England Patriots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
