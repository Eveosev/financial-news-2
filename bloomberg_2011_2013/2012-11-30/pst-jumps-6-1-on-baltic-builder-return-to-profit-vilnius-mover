AB Panevezio Statybos Trestas (PTR1L) ,
 Lithuania ’s largest publicly traded construction company, rose
6.1 percent after reporting a third-quarter profit after a half-
year loss.  The shares gained as much as 8.6 percent in Vilnius before
closing at 0.987 euros, extending gains from a 39-month low on
Nov. 27 to 11.4 percent. Volume of 43,323 shares was more than
five times the three-month daily average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  PST posted a consolidated group net income of 9.1 million
litai ($3.4 million) in the third quarter after a first-half
loss of 6.6 million litai, the company reported on the Nasdaq
OMX Vilnius exchange today. That is almost four times last
year’s third-quarter profit of 2.4 million litai.  The recovery was mainly due to positive developments at a
construction project in Kaliningrad,  Russia , which had hurt
profitability earlier in the year, PST said.  PST has projects in Lithuania, Russia, Scandinavia and the
U.K., according to its  website . Its  shareholders  include funds
managed by Legg Mason, which owns 5.73 percent, and Eaton Vance
Management, with 1.98 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Lithuanian road and railway builder AB Panevezio
Keliai held 49.78 percent of shares at the end of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
