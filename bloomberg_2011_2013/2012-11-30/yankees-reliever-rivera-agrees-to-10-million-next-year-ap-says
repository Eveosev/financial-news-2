Mariano Rivera , Major League
Baseballâ€™s career leader in saves, agreed to a $10 million one-
year contract to remain with the New York Yankees, the
Associated Press reported, citing a personal familiar with the
negotiations.  Rivera, 43, missed most of last season after he tore the
anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee while catching fly
balls during batting practice May 3. He has a record 608 saves.  Rivera took a cut in guaranteed salary from a $30 million
two-year deal for the past two seasons because of the knee
injury, the AP said.  The Yankees, who ended the season 95-67 to lead the
American League East, also signed deals in the last two weeks
with starting pitchers  Andy Pettitte  and  Hiroki Kuroda .  To contact the reporter on this story:
