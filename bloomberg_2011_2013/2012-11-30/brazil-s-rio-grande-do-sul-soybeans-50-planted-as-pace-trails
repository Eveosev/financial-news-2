Soybeans in Brazil’s  Rio Grande  do
Sul state, the country’s third-biggest grower, were 50 percent
planted as of yesterday, compared with 59 percent sown at the
same time last year, farm advisory service Emater/RS reported.  Planting completion rose from 42 percent a week ago,
meaning 8 percent of the area was seeded in the past seven days
compared with 14 percent in the year-earlier period, Emater/RS
data show. The crop was 47 percent germinated compared with 38
percent a week earlier, the service wrote in an  online report .  Rain this week will improve germination and initial crop
development, after heat and a lack of rain hurt sprouting for
part of the crop and in some cases killed plants due to high
soil temperatures, the service wrote. Yields will be lower in
fields that had to be replanted, Emater/RS wrote.  Mato Grosso is  Brazil ’s biggest soybean producer, followed
by Parana, government  statistics  show. Rio Grande do Sul is also
Brazil’s fourth-biggest corn grower.  Corn planting was 80 percent done as of yesterday, compared
with 75 percent at the same time last year as well as a week
earlier, while 20 percent of the crop was flowering, from 15
percent at the same time last year, according to Emater/RS.  Rio Grande do Sul is forecast to get “regular and well-
distributed” rainfall in the period through Dec. 6, with more
than 150 millimeters (5.9 inches) of rain in the south and 50 to
80 millimeters in other regions, according to Emater/RS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
