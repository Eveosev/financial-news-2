Former New York Yankees catcher
 Russell Martin  reached a two-year, $17 million free-agent deal
with the Pittsburgh Pirates, the New York Times reported.  “I had a great time in New York,” Martin said from his
Montreal hometown, the Times reported last night. “It was
probably the best baseball experience of my life, but this is
the business and it was time to move on.”  Martin, 29, who spent two years with  Major League
Baseball ’s Yankees, will have a physical today before the deal
is finalized, the Times said.  The Yankees, who are left with Chris Stewart,  Francisco Cervelli  and Eli Whiteside as catchers, told Martin they didn’t
have the money to meet his contract demands, the player said,
according to the Times.  Martin, who signed a two-year, $11.5 million deal with the
Yankees before the 2011 season, hit .224 in his two seasons with
the team with 39 home runs and 118 runs batted in.  To contact the reporter on this story:
