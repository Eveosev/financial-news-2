Colombia  wants to replace foreign
debt with internal debt to help fight the appreciation of the
peso, Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said.  The Andean nation aims to cut foreign debt to 22 percent of
the total, from 28 percent, over a period of about four years,
Cardenas said at an event at the National Federation of Coffee
Growers in Bogota today. Colombia will only issue foreign debt
to repay other external debt that is maturing, Cardenas said.  “We won’t bring dollars into Colombia,” Cardenas said.
“We want to cut external debt so as not to generate exchange
rate pressures and to be protected against fluctuations in
international markets.”  The government has submitted legislation to Congress that
would cut the tax on foreigners’ bond profits to 14 percent from
33 percent, to lure foreign investors to the local  debt market .
Cardenas said Nov. 19 he expects the law to pass by the end of
the year.  The peso has rallied 7.5 percent in the last 12 months, the
best performance against the dollar among 25 emerging market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. In trading today, it was little
changed at 1814.83 per dollar  The yield on the  government bonds  due July 2024 was
unchanged at 5.98 percent at 3:22 p.m. in Bogota.  As of Oct. 31, 73 percent of Colombia’s $33 billion in
external debt is in dollars, 23 percent is in pesos, and 4
percent is in yen, according to the  Finance Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
