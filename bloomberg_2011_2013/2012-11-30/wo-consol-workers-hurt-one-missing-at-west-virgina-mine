An employee of  Consol Energy Inc. (CNX) ,
the largest U.S. coal miner by market value, is missing and two
others were injured at a West Virginia plant after a bulldozer
and two trucks fell into a pond.  The vehicles slid into the pond after an embankment gave
way at Consol’s Robinson Run preparation plan in Harrison
County, Lynn Seay, a spokeswoman for the Canonsburg,
Pennsylvania-based company said in an e-mail today. The company
doesn’t yet know if the accident will impact operations or
production at the facility, Seay said. The plant processes waste
from mining operations.  One of the injured employees is in stable condition at a
local hospital, while the other was flown by helicopter to a
nearby hospital, Seay said. A third employee is still
unaccounted for, she said.  The company is working with federal and state mining
officials at the site to determine the cause of the incident.  Consol  fell  2.7 percent to $31.08 at 3:09 p.m. in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
