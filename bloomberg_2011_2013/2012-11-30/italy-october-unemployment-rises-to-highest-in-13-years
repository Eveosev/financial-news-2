Italy ’s  unemployment rate  rose more
than expected in October to the highest level in 13 years as
businesses refrain from hiring after the recession entered its
second year.  The  unemployment rate  rose to a seasonally-adjusted 11.1
percent from 10.8 percent in September, Rome-based national
statistics office Istat said in a preliminary report today.
Economists had predicted a reading of 10.9 percent, according to
the  median  of eight estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.
Unemployment remained above 10 percent for a ninth month.  Italy entered its fourth recession since 2001 in the final
quarter of last year. The slump deepened amid the effects of tax
increases and public spending cuts passed by Prime Minister
 Mario Monti ’s government aimed at containing the euro-region’s
second-biggest debt. The Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development said this week Italy’s economy will shrink 2.2
percent this year. That compares with the government forecast of
a contraction of 2.4 percent.  Slumping household demand may have contributed to a drop in
consumer prices in November, with the European-Union harmonized
inflation rate slipping to 2.6 percent from 2.8 percent the
previous month, Istat also said today. Household confidence
declined this month to the lowest since records began in 1996 as
consumers grew more pessimistic about the economic outlook,
Istat said Nov. 26.  The unemployment rate in the third quarter reached 10.6
percent, up from 10.5 percent in the three months through June,
Istat said. Monthly unemployment data collection started in
2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
