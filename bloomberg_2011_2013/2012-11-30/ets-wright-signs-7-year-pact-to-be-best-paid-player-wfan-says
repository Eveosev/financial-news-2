New York  Mets third baseman  David
Wright  signed a seven-year, $122 million extension that will
make him the best-paid player in the baseball team’s history,
radio station WFAN said, without saying where it got the
information.  The 29-year-old will get a total of $138 million when the
new contract, which starts in 2014, and the final year of his
current deal, which pays him $16 million, are combined, the New
York station said. He’s played for the Mets for his entire nine-
year career.  The contract surpasses the six-year deal signed by pitcher
Johan Santana, who is being paid $137.5 million, WFAN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
