Gold capped its biggest weekly drop
in more than five months on concern that U.S. lawmakers may fail
to reach a settlement in talks aimed at avoiding self-imposed
tax increases and budget cuts known as the fiscal cliff.  Republican House Speaker  John Boehner  told reporters that
budget talks were in a stalemate and the Obama administration’s
offer yesterday wasn’t a “serious” proposal. The president
said today he expects prolonged negotiations. Gold tumbled 2.2
percent this week, the most since June 22.  “Fiscal-cliff concern is keeping investors on the
sidelines,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated
Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview.  Gold futures for February delivery slid 1 percent to settle
at $1,712.70 an ounce at 1:43 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Prices retreated 0.4 percent this month, the second straight
loss.  Silver futures for March delivery fell 3.3 percent to
$33.279 an ounce on the Comex. Prices dropped 2.7 percent this
week, the most since Nov. 2.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery slipped 0.9 percent to $1,604.60 an ounce,
extending the weekly loss to 0.8 percent.  Palladium futures for March delivery gained 0.1 percent to
$688.20 an ounce. Prices rose 3.1 percent this week, the fifth
straight gain.  To contact the reporters on this story:
