Australia’s bowlers had the upper
hand on the opening day of the final cricket Test against South
Africa in Perth.  Nathan Lyon took 3-41 as South Africa was dismissed for 225
after winning the toss and electing to bat. Mitchell Starc
claimed two wickets as Australia took 5-14 on either side of the
lunch break.  Faf du Plessis finished an unbeaten 78 and Robin Peterson
scored 31 for the visitors.  South Africa’s bowlers then struck quickly as  Ed Cowan 
edged the third ball to Jacques Kallis off  Dale Steyn . Shane Watson was then trapped leg before wicket by Vernon Philander
for 10 in the sixth over as Australia went on to reach 33-2 at
stumps.  David Warner will resume on 12 tomorrow, with night
watchman Lyon on seven.  Former Australia captain  Ricky Ponting  is playing the final
match of his career. The 37-year-old, Australia’s record run
scorer, announced yesterday he would retire after the Test.  The three-Test series has opened with two draws. South
Africa would retain the No. 1 spot in the International Cricket
Council’s Test rankings by avoiding defeat in the final contest,
while Australia can overtake the Proteas at the top with a win.  To contact the reporter on this story:
