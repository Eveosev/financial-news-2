Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , the second-
largest mobile-phone company, will reorganize the enterprise
businesses into one group and named Nick Jeffery as head.  The new unit, starting Jan. 1, will include Vodafone’s
global enterprise and carrier services business, as well as
machine-to-machine and hosting and cloud services, the Newbury,
England-based company said in a statement today.  Vodafone is reconfiguring its enterprise business as part
of a faster integration of  Cable & Wireless  Worldwide which it
bought for 1.04 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) this year. Jeffery
was named head of Cable & Wireless in July and had formerly run
the company’s global enterprise unit. New global enterprise
chief Jan Geldmacher will retain his position and report to
Jeffery, the company said.  “It has become clear that there is strong customer demand
for combined products and services,” Vodafone said in the
statement. “To realize this growth opportunity, we have decided
to accelerate the CWW integration process ahead of our original
schedule.”  Also starting Jan. 1, the two companies will combine their
U.K.-based enterprise businesses,  customer service , human
resources, finance and other departments.  Vodafone kept its forecast for about 500 million pounds of
integration costs and cash flow synergies of as much as 200
million pounds a year by 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
