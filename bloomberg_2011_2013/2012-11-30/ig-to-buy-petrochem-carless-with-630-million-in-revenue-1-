HIG Capital’s European investment
arm said it’s poised to acquire Petrochem Carless, a U.K.
blender and supplier of solvents and fluids used in the
automotive, crop and energy industries.  Talks with the company are at an “advanced stage,” Miami-
based HIG Capital said in a statement today, without disclosing
financial details. Petrochem Carless reported revenue of 390.3
million pounds ($630 million) in 2011, with operating profit of
about 25 million pounds, similar to the year before.  The purchase would add to HIG’s investments in chemicals,
giving scope for savings in procurement with Haltermann, a
German refinery products maker that the U.S. buyout firm
purchased last year serving a similar customer base to Petrochem
Carless. Leatherhead, Surrey-based Petrochem Carless has a
refining and blending plant in Harwich, east of  London .  HIG’s strategy is focused on building up the strength of
investments via acquisitions and market consolidation, before
exiting at a later stage. The latest deal, which may be
completed in early 2013, is subject to clearance from antitrust
regulators. Competitors include global energy companies such as
 Exxon Mobil (XOM)  Corp.  Petrochem Carless generated 16.6 million pounds in cash
last year and debt stood at 5.4 million pounds. The company said
at the start of this year that “strong customer demand” was
continuing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
