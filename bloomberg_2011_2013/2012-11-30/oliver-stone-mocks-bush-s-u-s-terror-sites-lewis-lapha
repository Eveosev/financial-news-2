The  Bush administration  did not
launch an investigation into the failure of U.S. intelligence
after the Sept. 11th terrorist attacks. It did, however, rush
the Patriot Act through Congress, expanding government
surveillance and investigative powers.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  According to  Oliver Stone , co-author with Peter Kuznick of
“The Untold History of the United States” and director of the
10-part Showtime TV series, the government began sending out
constant security alerts to keep fearful Americans from
protesting their eroding civil liberties.  Points of U.S. vulnerability were identified, beginning
with 160 potential terrorist targets. The number jumped to 1,849
in 2003, a year later reaching more than 28,000.  By 2007, 300,000 locations were on the list, with Indiana
in the lead: It had 8,591, three times as many as California.
The national targets included petting zoos, doughnut shops and
the Mule Day Parade in Columbia, Tennessee.  I spoke with Stone on the following topics:  1. American Wars  2. Supporting Tyrants  3. Economic Penetration  4. Dropping Nukes  5. Why Vietnam?
