The  Oakland Raiders  suspended
linebacker Rolando McClain two games for conduct detrimental to
the National Football League team.  The Raiders didn’t divulge the reason for the suspension in
a statement today. The ban ends Dec. 10, and the 23-year-old
McClain, a former first-round draft pick, is eligible to return
for the team’s Dec. 16 game against the  Kansas City Chiefs .  Raiders coach Dennis Allen said yesterday that he asked
McClain not to come to practice. He did not specify what caused
that decision.  “There’s going to be consequences to his actions,” Allen
said. “It’s a team-related issue and I don’t really want to get
into the details of it.”  McClain, who played college football at the  University of
Alabama , was selected by the Raiders with the eighth pick in the
2010 NFL Draft. He has 60 tackles, one forced fumble and one
sack this season.  McClain was arrested last year following a shooting in
Alabama, and in May was convicted of four misdemeanors. He
appealed the charges, which were dropped when the accuser told
prosecutors he did not want to pursue the case, according to
ESPN.  Omar Gaither is next on the linebacker depth chart behind
McClain, Allen said.  -- Editors: Jay Beberman, Rob Gloster  To contact the reporter on this story:
