(Corrects name of  AK Steel  in headline.)  ArcelorMittal (MT)  won a revival of its
patent-infringement case against AK Steel Corp. over a process
to make steel stronger so it can be used in automobile
manufacturing.  A trial judge erred in her interpretation of what an
ArcelorMittal patent covered, the  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the
Federal Circuit today said in an  opinion  posted on its website.
The Federal Circuit said the judge should consider whether the
patent was valid and infringed. It said she could consider
ruling on the issue without need for a new trial.  To contact the reporter on this story:
