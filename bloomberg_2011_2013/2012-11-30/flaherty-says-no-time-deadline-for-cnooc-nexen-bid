Canadian Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty  said he’s not aware of a “time deadline” for a
decision by the Canadian government on existing reviews of
foreign takeovers and the government’s new investment
guidelines.  Asked if he expects the government to release new
guidelines and decide by Dec. 10 on reviews of  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ’s bid
for  Nexen Inc. (NXY)  and Petroliam Nasional Bhd.’s bid for  Progress
Energy Resources Corp. (PRQ) , Flaherty said: “There is no time
deadline for which I’m aware. We’re having continuing
discussions on the subject.”  “It’s a very important decision for the government of
Canada, has long term consequences for foreign direct investment
in Canada,” he said.  Flaherty said he also expects to remain as finance minister
until the budget is balanced, which he has said will happen
before the next elections due in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
