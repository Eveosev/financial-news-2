Spain ’s olive oil exports, the
world’s biggest, rose 5.8 percent in the year through September,
farm and food-industry group Cooperativas Agro-Alimentarias
reported, citing government data.  Shipments climbed to 875,460 metric tons in 2011-12 from
827,711 tons in the previous year, the Madrid-based group wrote
in a  report  on its website today.  Spain has predicted olive-oil output will fall 58 percent
this year to 673,700 tons from 1.6 million tons last year, after
the country had its second-driest summer in 60 years.  Exports to  Italy , the biggest single customer for Spanish
olive oil, fell to 382,425 tons in 2011-12 from 409,390 tons a
year earlier, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
