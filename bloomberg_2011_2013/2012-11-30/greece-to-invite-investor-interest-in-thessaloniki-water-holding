Greece  plans to invite investors
next month to formally express interest in buying some or all of
its 74 percent stake in  Thessaloniki Water Supply & Sewage Co. (EYAPS) 
SA, the country’s second-largest water company.  The invitation, the first step of the sales process, is
scheduled to take place by the end of the year, according to the
Hellenic Republic Assets Development Fund’s plan for selling
Greek state assets.  While the fund has decided on the process to sell
Thessaloniki Water, its final decision will be made after the
plan has been presented to a parliamentary committee, HRADF said
Nov. 21. No date has been set yet for the presentation.  Greece’s stake in the water supplier is valued at 131.4
million euros ($171 million) based on current trading prices.
The share price has risen 53 percent since the beginning of the
year. France’s  Suez Environnement Co. (SEV)  has a 5 percent stake in
the company, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
