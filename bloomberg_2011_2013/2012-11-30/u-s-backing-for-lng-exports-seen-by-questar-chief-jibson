Ron Jibson, the incoming chairman of
the  American Gas Association  and top executive of an energy
company, said he expects the U.S. Energy Department to approve
“closely controlled” exports of natural gas.  “Hopefully we do proceed with some caution,” Jibson,
chief executive officer of  Questar Corp. (STR) , told reporters today
at the AGA’s Washington office.  The Energy Department is reviewing as many as 15
applications from companies to build export terminals to ship
gas to countries including  Japan . The department said it plans
to release an analysis of the economic impact of exports before
the end of the year.  Jibson said he thought the administration wouldn’t allow
unlimited exports because the sales might raise costs for
domestic gas users. At the same time, Jibson said exports can
“promote development of the product.”  AGA represents more than 200 natural-gas distribution
companies. Jibson will be chairman for 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
