Ethanol strengthened against
gasoline after a Hess Corp. refinery startup up in  New Jersey 
added to regional supplies and sent motor-fuel prices lower.  The grain-based additive’s discount to gasoline narrowed to
35.34 cents a gallon from 35.9 cents yesterday, based on
December futures prices. The difference has averaged 62.82 cents
this year and reached 99.8 cents on Sept. 28. Gasoline also fell
after Colonial Pipeline Co. returned service to its main
gasoline line from the  Gulf Coast  to  North Carolina . Ethanol was
buoyed by a drop in corn, the fuel’s feedstock in the U.S.  “Ethanol’s actually holding up pretty well today, all
things being considered,” said  Chris Wilson , an analyst at
Atten Babler Risk Management LLC in Galena,  Illinois . “It’s
still a tough margin environment.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery slipped 2 cents, or
0.8 percent, to settle at $2.408 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board
of Trade. The futures dropped 1.1 percent in November.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast fell 2
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.575 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive lost 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.425, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf declined 1.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.485 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel slipped
1.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.52.  Gasoline for December delivery fell 2.56 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.7614 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract, which expired today, covers reformulated
gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to
filling stations.  Corn Drops  Corn for March delivery fell 6 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$7.5275 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol. Corn rose to a record $8.49 on Aug. 10.  Based on December contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 31 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from
30 cents yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed
from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock, according to
data collected by Bloomberg.  “It’s just a slow bleed,” Wilson said. “It’s just that
fine line on how long can guys go with negative margins before
shutting down.”  He said ethanol in the U.S. has also been pressured by a
lack of export demand because higher corn prices make it less
competitive on the global market.  Ethanol on the Brazilian spot market  is fetching $2.04 a
gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The fuel is derived from sugarcane in  Brazil , giving that
country a competitive edge over U.S. manufacturers, Wilson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
