People’s Insurance Company (Group)
of China (1339) , the nation’s biggest property insurer, raised HK$24
billion ($3.1 billion) in Hong Kong’s largest initial public
offering in two years, people with knowledge of the matter said.  PICC Group sold about 6.9 billion shares at HK$3.48 apiece,
near the bottom of a marketed range, said the two people, asking
not to be identified because the information is private. The IPO
is the largest in Hong Kong since October 2010, when  AIA Group
Ltd. (1299)  raised $20.5 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The insurer defied a 78 percent slump in the value of Hong
Kong IPOs this year, thanks in part to $1.82 billion of pre-
negotiated investments with  American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
and 16 other so-called cornerstone investors, to complete the
offering. Before the sale, companies had raised $3.5 billion in
Hong Kong IPOs this year, the lowest for similar periods since
2001, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Liquidity is helping, and good companies with reasonable
valuations can attract investors,” said  Binay Chandgothia , a
Hong Kong-based portfolio manager at Principal Global Investors,
which oversees about $250 billion.  An external spokeswoman for PICC Group declined to comment
on the final price.  Founded in October 1949, PICC Group offers property,
casualty, life and health insurance products. It had about 130
million individual customers and 2.4 million institutional
clients at the end of June, according to the prospectus.  China’s Stake  PICC Group is the biggest property insurer in China with
163 billion yuan in premium income for the first 10 months of
this year, according to the website of  China Insurance
Regulatory Commission .  The shares were originally marketed at HK$3.42 to HK$4.03
each, according to a  prospectus  for the offering, which accounts
for about 16.7 percent of the insurer’s enlarged share capital.
Based on the percentage, the sale values PICC Group at $18.6
billion.  China’s Ministry of Finance, which held an 88.7 percent
stake in PICC Group before the IPO, will own 72.5 percent after
the sale, the prospectus shows.  The offering values PICC Group at 19.1 times earnings of
$975 million for the 12 months through June 30, Bloomberg data
show. That compares with 10.6 times for Hong Kong-traded  PICC
Property & Casualty Co. (2328) , in which PICC Group has a 69 percent
stake, and 34.6 times for China Life Insurance Co.  China International Capital Corp., Credit Suisse Group AG,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and HSBC Holdings Plc managed the
share sale as joint sponsors.  Cornerstone Investors  Cornerstone investments from companies including AIG,  Tokio
Marine Holdings Inc. (8766)  and China State Grid Corp. accounted for
about 59 percent of the IPO, compared with an average of 26
percent for eight other Hong Kong offerings worth at least $1
billion in the last two years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Cornerstone investors were allotted a guaranteed amount of
stock in exchange for the promise that they won’t sell PICC
shares within six months.  China’s  Social Security Fund  acquired 11.3 percent of PICC
Group for 10 billion  yuan  ($1.61 billion) in June last year,
according to a statement on the fund’s website. That transaction
valued the insurer at about 90 billion yuan.  PICC Group demanded a premium to the 90 billion yuan
valuation because the pension fund bought its shares at a
discount, people with knowledge of the matter said Nov. 12. The
Social Security Fund’s stake in the company will fall to 10.9
percent after the offering, PICC Group’s prospectus shows.  China’s insurance market expanded at an average 19 percent
annual pace in the past decade to become the world’s sixth
biggest, while insurers’ assets jumped 10 times, according to
the industry regulator.  The country’s improving economic outlook is helping boost
confidence in Hong Kong IPOs, said Michiya Tomita, a fund
manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which oversees
$70 billion. Confidence in the Chinese economy is at the highest
in more than a year, according to a Bloomberg investor poll.  “ China ’s fundamentals are coming back and an influx of
money to Hong Kong is also supporting the market,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
