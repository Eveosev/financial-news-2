Hire costs for Panamax vessels used
to ship minerals and grains declined for a fourth day as low
water levels in the  Mississippi River  cut cargoes available for
export, reducing vessel numbers booked for transits to  Asia .  Average rates for the ships declined 1.4 percent to $7,815
daily, according to the  Baltic Exchange , a London-based assessor
of freight costs. The Baltic Dry Index, a wider measure of
shipping costs, slid 1 percent to 1,086.  Delays in delivering grains along the waterway to port for
export because of low water levels is making the commodity more
expensive, slowing shipments to Asia, Braemar Seascope Ltd., a
London-based shipbroker, said in an e-mailed report today.  “Buying interest for U.S. Gulf grains and fresh stems have
been slow to develop, contributing to a general slowdown in
fronthaul activity,” the company said. Rates for so-called
fronthaul journeys, from the Atlantic Ocean to the  Pacific
Ocean , fell 0.7 percent to $14,903, exchange data show. A stem
is an industry term for a cargo to be booked.  Low water levels on the  Mississippi , a waterway used to
ship grains by barge to terminals in the U.S. Gulf, is
threatening to disrupt exports, Deutsche Bank AG said in an e-
mailed report today.  Average rates for Capesize ships, the largest tracked by
the index,  declined 2.2 percent to $15,869 daily, while
Supramaxes able to carry cargoes of about 50,000 metric tons,
advanced by 0.8 percent to $8,005 daily. Handysizes, the
smallest, rose by 0.4 percent to $6,605 daily.  To contact the reporter on this story:
