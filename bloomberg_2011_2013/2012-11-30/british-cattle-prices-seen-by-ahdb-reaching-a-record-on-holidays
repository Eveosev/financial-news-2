Cattle prices climbed to records
last week in Great Britain as meat buyers stocked up for an
anticipated increase in consumer demand for the holidays, the
Agriculture & Horticulture Development Board said.  Steer carcass, or deadweight, prices rose to 3.609 pounds a
kilogram ($2.60 a pound) on average in the week ended Nov. 24,
up 5 percent from a week earlier, according to an e-mailed
report from the Kenilworth, England-based researcher’s cattle
and sheep unit EBLEX. While prime cattle slaughtering rose from
a week earlier, processing was still 6 percent below the same
time in 2011, AHDB said.  “With the Christmas procurement period drawing to a close,
prime prices have continued to climb ever higher,” AHDB said.
“All reported deadweight categories rose on the week to reach
new record highs. Prices continue to be boosted further by what
is still a very tight supply situation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
