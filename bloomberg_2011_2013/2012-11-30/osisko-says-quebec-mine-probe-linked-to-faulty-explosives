Osisko Mining Corp. (OSK) , which operates
the Malartic gold mine in  Quebec , said an investigation by
provincial authorities at the project is connected to faulty
explosives supplied by a contractor.  Some of the explosives supplied by Orica Mining Services
Ltd. released levels of nitrous oxide that exceeded
environmental rules, Osisko Chief Executive Officer Sean Roosen
said yesterday in an interview.  “Some of it has been human error, most of it has to do
with the blasting products and that has been subsequently
rectified,” he said by phone.  Osisko said Nov. 28 that investigators from Quebec’s
environment ministry searched the mine that day and seized
documents related to drilling, loading and blasting activities
for dates between April 2011 and October 2012.  “Orica will assist the Canadian authorities with their
enquiries,” Ben Wilson, a spokesman for Orica Mining Services,
a unit of Melbourne-based  Orica Ltd. (ORI) , said today by phone.  Osisko said operations at the mine, which began commercial
production in May 2011, are continuing as normal. Fewer than six
blasts had problems out of more than 700 carried out this year,
Roosen said. The nearby town of Malartic wasn’t in danger
because the company won’t blast when the wind is blowing in that
direction, he said. Osisko reported the problems to regulators
and has cooperated with the investigation, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
