Indian stocks climbed to a 19-month
high on optimism the government will extend an economic-policy
overhaul to bolster investment after growth slowed last quarter
to match a three-year low.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 0.9 percent
to 19,339.90 at the close, taking this month’s advance to 4.5
percent. Volumes on the measure were almost triple the 30-day
average, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Housing Development
Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the biggest mortgage lender, extended gains from
a record.  Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL)  and  Jindal Steel & Power
Ltd. (JSP)  jumped more than 5 percent each.  Data today showed  gross domestic product  grew 5.3 percent
in the three months to Sept. 30 from a year ago, in line with
the median of 42 estimates in a Bloomberg survey and down from
5.5 percent in the previous quarter. The government yesterday
agreed to opposition demands for a vote on its plan to allow
overseas companies to set up supermarkets, paving way for the
functioning of parliament after four days of adjournments.  “The market is playing for the next fiscal year and the
measures the government is trying to push will bear fruit going
forward,” said Shishir Bajpai, senior vice president at IIFL
Wealth Management Ltd. in Mumbai. “There is intent from the
government on economic reforms.” IIFL has $1.8 billion in
stocks under management and advisory.  Foreign Fund Purchases  The Sensex has increased 25 percent this year, driven by
foreign flows and economic policy measures. Offshore investors
 bought  $360 million more local stocks than they sold yesterday,
the most in two months, taking monthly inflows to $1.7 billion,
exchange data show. They have purchased a net $19.8 billion of
shares this year, the highest among 10 Asian markets tracked by
Bloomberg, excluding  China , the data show.  The flows propelled the local currency to its first weekly
gain since October. The rupee advanced 2.3 percent this week to
54.2650 per dollar, paring its loss in November to 0.8 percent.  Housing Development Finance, the biggest mortgage lender,
soared 2.6 percent to 843.50 rupees.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the No.3
lender by value, added 1.7 percent to 1,099.85 rupees.  State
Bank of India , the second-largest by market value, added 1.8
percent to 2,170.3 rupees. The 14-member Bankex index increased
1.5 percent to its highest level since December 2010.  “If the economy improves then the stress on their balance
sheets comes down,” IIFL’s Bajpai said. “Banks’ earnings will
further improve if non-performing assets come down.”  Metal Producers  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT) , the biggest copper and
zinc producer, surged 3 percent to 108.55 rupees, extending this
week’s rally to 12.5 percent, the best performer among the 30
Sensex stocks. Aluminum maker  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL)  rose 3.1
percent to 116.6 rupees.  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , the largest producer
of the alloy, gained 2.5 percent to 386.2 rupees.  Bharat Heavy, the biggest power-equipment maker, jumped 5.5
percent to 234.35 rupees, its steepest climb since Oct. 4.
Jindal Steel rallied 5.8 percent to 403.05 rupees.  Oil & Natural
Gas Corp. (ONGC) , the largest state-owned oil explorer, soared 4.4
percent to 264.95 rupees, erasing this year’s loss.  The Sensex is the second-best performer since Jan. 1 among
global benchmark gauges with at least $1 trillion in market
value, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The  measure  has fallen
in December only once in the past nine years, the data show.  “The momentum is with the market and there are a lot of
tailwinds like reform expectations and foreign inflows,” Dilip Bhat, joint managing director of Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt., told
Bloomberg TV  India  today.  Moody’s, Goldman  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s government, striving to
avert a credit-rating downgrade, snapped months of paralysis in
September by curbing fuel subsidies and giving retailers such as
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. the chance to set up stores.  Opposition led by the Bharatiya Janata Party accused the
government of reneging on a promise to win legislative support
for the retail policy. Singh’s administration gave ground after
talks with allies and regional parties that have signaled they
are unlikely to vote against the ruling bloc.  Moody’s Investors Service maintained its stable outlook on
India’s investment-grade credit rating and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. yesterday raised local shares to overweight.  The S&P CNX  Nifty Index (NIFTY)  on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. added 0.9 percent to 5,879.85. The 50-stock measure
will reach 6,600 by December next year, Goldman said, joining
Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. in predicting a positive
outlook for Indian equities for 2013.  The Sensex may rally to 23,069 by December 2013, Morgan
Stanley analysts led by  Ridham Desai  wrote in a Nov. 26 report.
JPMorgan said Nov. 19 that Indian stocks are its top selection
among the so-called BRIC nations next year.  The Sensex is valued at 15.8 times estimated earnings,
compared with the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s 11.7 times,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
