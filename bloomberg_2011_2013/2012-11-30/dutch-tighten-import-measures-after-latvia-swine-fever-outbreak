The Netherlands tightened cleaning
requirements for trucks transporting livestock from  Latvia ,
after the Baltic country reported cases of classical swine fever
in domestic pigs.  The European Union has implemented a ban on transport of
pigs in the affected region, the Dutch Ministry of Economic
Affairs wrote in a  statement  on its website today. Trucks
unloading livestock from Latvia will be required to cleaned and
disinfected at a certified facility, it said.  Latvia found the hog disease in pigs on three farms since
Nov. 23, after detecting the virus in the organs of two wild
boars on Nov. 16, according to a notification two days ago to
the World Organisation for  Animal Health .  To contact the reporter on this story:
