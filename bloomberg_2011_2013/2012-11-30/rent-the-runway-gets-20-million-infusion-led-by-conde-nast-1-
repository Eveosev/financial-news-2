Rent the Runway Inc., a  New York 
startup that lets customers rent designer fashion, received a
$20 million investment led by Advance Publications Inc., the
parent company of magazine publisher Conde Nast.  Bain Capital Ventures, Highland  Capital Partners  and
Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers also provided financing, Rent
the Runway said today in a statement.  The company was founded three years ago to bring a Netflix-
style approach to fashion, letting women rent high-end gowns,
shoes and purses through the mail. The latest funding will allow
the company to improve its technology, helping customers find
items that better match their tastes, President Jennifer Fleiss
said in an interview. Rent the Runway also later may expand
internationally and move into new product lines.  “We need more personalization for the site -- the styling
elements and pairing things together -- and being able to handle
the traffic,” Fleiss said. “We’ve been growing over 100
percent year over year in pretty much every category.”  Rent the Runway previously raised more than $31 million in
 venture capital . With the new investment,  Conde Nast  President
Bob Sauerberg will join the board. The publishing company, owned
by the family of billionaire Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr., owns
magazines such as  Vanity Fair , Vogue and Glamour. It also has
made investments in other fashion startups, including Moda
Operandi.  “They’ve always held a high premium on creating
aspirational brands,” Fleiss said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
