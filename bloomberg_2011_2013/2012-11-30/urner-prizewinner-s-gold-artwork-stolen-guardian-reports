Thieves stole a Turner Prize-
winner’s gold sculpture insured for 500,000 pounds ($802,300)
from a storage facility run by fine art auctioneers  Christie
Group Plc (CTG) , the Guardian reported, citing police and the artist.  Douglas Gordon, who won the Turner art prize in 1999, said
he feared the work, of two hands sculpted in gold and made in
2007, may have already been melted down by thieves for its
estimated scrap value of about 250,000 pounds, the newspaper
reported.  The work, entitled “The Left Hand and the Right Hand Have
Abandoned One Another,” was being held by Christie’s pending a
private sale, the Guardian said.  Christie’s wouldn’t comment on security aarrangements, the
newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
