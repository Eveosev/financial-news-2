The European Union hasn’t reached an
agreement on leverage, liquidity and capital rules in its
efforts to implement the Basel accords on global banking
standards, according to a document prepared for a meeting of
finance ministers next week.  “Intensive efforts” to reach political agreement will
continue on the legislation on implementing the Basel rules,
according to the document, which notes that debate has been
“narrowed down to a limited number of key issues.” The paper,
obtained by  Bloomberg News , was prepared by Cyprus, which holds
the EU’s rotating presidency.  EU officials have agreed on some provisions of the new law,
such as reporting requirements for  repurchase agreements ,
according to the document. Elements such as disclosures,
treatment of covered bonds, small and medium-sized businesses
and other risk-weighting issues also have been agreed on, the
paper showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
