About 3,000 Jordanians demonstrated
in Amman today against a recent government decision to end
subsidies on fuel.  Protesters demanded the dismissal of Prime Minister
Abdullah Ensourâ€™s government, an end to corruption and the right
to elect governments. They also called for the release of
demonstrators who were arrested in recent rallies against the
subsidy decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
