Bharti Infratel Ltd. (BHIN)  will raise as
much as 45.3 billion rupees ($831 million) in India’s biggest
initial public offering in two years as billionaire Sunil Mittal
seeks funds to expand his mobile-phone tower business.  The unit of India’s largest wireless operator will offer
shares at 210 rupees to 240 rupees apiece, according to a term
sheet obtained by  Bloomberg News . Bharti Infratel’s offering
consists of 146.2 million new shares and 42.7 million existing
ones, the terms show.  The share sale, the largest since state-owned  Coal India
Ltd. (COAL) ’s $3.5 billion sale in October 2010, marks the revival of
the IPO market after India’s benchmark  Sensex index  increased 24
percent to a 19-month high. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are forecasting a positive
outlook for Indian equities for 2013. Initial share sales in
 India  tumbled 77 percent to 14 billion rupees this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Sensex’s gains, driven by foreign flows and policy
measures, have made it the second-best performer this year among
benchmark measures with at least $1 trillion in value, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. India’s  S&P CNX Nifty Index (NIFTY)  may
climb about 13 percent by the end of next year, Goldman Sachs,
said in a report yesterday.  The IPO of the unit of  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI)  will provide an
exit for companies such as Temasek Holdings Pte, Goldman Sachs
and Citigroup Inc., which bought a $1 billion stake in 2007.
Other Bharti Infratel investors include KKR & Co., the
leveraged-buyout firm led by  Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts ,
which agreed in February 2008 to invest $250 million in a deal
that valued the company at $12.5 billion.  Bharti Airtel, which has more mobile-phone users than the
population of Japan, fell 0.4 percent to 329.2 rupees at 11:24
a.m. in Mumbai. The shares have dropped 5 percent this year.  Bidding Dates  Investors will be able to bid from Dec. 11 to Dec. 14,
according to the terms. Bharti Infratel owns more than 34,000
telecommunications towers in 11 of India’s 22 operation zones.
The company has a 42 percent stake in Indus Towers Ltd., the
world’s largest tower company.  Bharti Infratel will use 10.9 billion rupees for adding
4,813 towers, according to the company’s prospectus. It will use
12.1 billion rupees to upgrade and replace existing towers.  “Operators’ spending indicates demand for towers is going
to increase,”  Akhil Gupta , managing director of Bharti
Infratel, said in New Delhi today. “The sale comes on the heel
of anticipated surge in data traffic.”  Bharti has hired Standard Chartered Plc, JPMorgan, Barclays
Plc, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Enam Securities Pvt., HSBC
Holdings Plc, Kotak Mahindra Capital Co., Deutsche Bank AG and
UBS AG for the tower unit sale.  Mittal, 55, is India’s eighth-richest man with a net worth
of $7 billion, according to the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index .  To contact the reporters on this story:
