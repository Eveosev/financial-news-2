Arabica-coffee futures fell, capping
the second straight monthly drop, on forecasts for higher
production in  Brazil , the world’s top producer, and  Colombia ,
the second-biggest. Orange juice slid, and cocoa and cotton
rose.  Brazil’s total coffee output in 2013 may reach 54 million
bags, a record for the smaller crop of the biennial harvest,
according to Volcafe, a unit of ED&F Man Holdings Ltd. In the
year started Oct. 1, Colombian production may rise 8.5 percent
to 8.3 million bags, a U.S. Department of Agriculture unit said
yesterday. Futures rose 5 percent the previous three days.  “There are no supply issues, and coffee had an impressive
performance” this week, Sterling Smith, a futures specialist at
Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “The
better levels probably brought some producer selling. The path
of least resistance for this market is down.”  Arabica coffee for March delivery tumbled 3.7 percent to
settle at $1.506 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, the biggest drop for a most-active contract since Nov. 13.
This month, the commodity dropped 2.6 percent, following an 11
percent plunge in October.  This year, coffee has tumbled 34 percent, the most among 24
raw materials in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI index.  Orange-juice  futures for January delivery slid 0.7 percent
to $1.2325 a pound in New York. This month, the price surged 16
percent, the most since January.  Cocoa futures for March delivery advanced 0.3 percent to
$2,498 a metric ton. In November, the price gained 4.6 percent,
ending a two-month slump.  Cotton futures for March delivery climbed 0.8 percent to
73.91 cents a pound. This month, the fiber jumped 5.5 percent,
the first increase since August.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery were unchanged at
19.34 cents a pound. The price declined 0.6 percent in November,
following a 4.7 percent slump in October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
