Slovak Premier  Robert Fico  said he
wants the new owner of a 49 percent stake in the country’s
biggest gas company, Slovensky Plynarensky Priemysel AS, to
accept “tighter” price regulation.  E.ON SE and  GDF Suez (GSZ)  are selling their stake in the
utility, which comes with a majority on its board, to
Energeticky a Prumyslovy Holding AS, Czech Republic’s private-
equity group. Fico’s government, which holds a majority in the
company, is negotiating with EPH conditions, under which it will
allow the transaction.  “I believe that a tighter regulatory framework will be
part of the conditions and Slovakia could be more involved in
price setting,” Fico said at a press conference in Slovak
capital, Bratislava, today.  Fico has criticized the current two foreign investors for
seeking increases in household prices that ignore living
standards in the euro-area’s second-poorest country. The Office
for Network Industries today rejected Slovensky’s request for a
25 percent increase in household gas prices, allowed only a 0.46
percent rise from January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
