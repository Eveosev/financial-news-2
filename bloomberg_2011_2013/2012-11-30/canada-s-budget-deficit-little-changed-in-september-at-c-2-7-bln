Canada ’s  federal budget  deficit was
little changed in September from a year earlier as rising
transfers to provinces and higher  unemployment insurance 
payments offset spending cuts to government departments.  The deficit was C$2.69 billion ($2.71 billion) in
September, from C$2.75 billion a year earlier, the finance
department said today in a monthly fiscal report from Ottawa.
Transfers to provincial governments were up 4.2 percent, while
spending on government programs and departments fell 4.9
percent. Transfers to individuals, including payments of
unemployment insurance, rose 6.5 percent.  Revenue in September was unchanged at C$18.5 billion as
higher insurance premiums and income taxes offset a drop in
sales tax income.  The deficit in the first six months of the fiscal year that
began April 1 shrank to C$8.89 billion from C$11.8 billion in
the previous period. Six-month revenue is up 2.8 percent to
C$120.9 billion, with expenses rising 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
