Germany ’s 10-year bonds advanced for
the first month since July after a report showed the jobless
rate in the euro area climbed to a record in October, indicating
the region is struggling to boost growth.  Austrian and Belgian 10-year yields fell, extending records
for a third day, as separate data showed  inflation  in the
common-currency region slowed for a second month in November.
Spanish 10-year bonds posted a third monthly gain after a Greek
aid agreement this week helped push yields to the lowest since
March yesterday. The benchmark German bund  yield  was four basis
points from its lowest since Nov. 20.  “The announcements we’ve had on the euro zone have been
relatively constructive but at the same time there’s evidence
that the economic situation is deteriorating,” said  Patrick Jacq , a senior fixed-income strategist at BNP Paribas SA in
Paris. “This is dragging core yields down,” he said, referring
to the region’s highest-rated securities.  The German 10-year yield rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.39 percent at 4:41 p.m.  London  time, set
for a seven basis-point slide since the end of October. It
reached 1.35 percent two days ago, the lowest since Nov. 20. The
1.5 percent bond due September 2022 lost 0.18, or 1.80 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,300) face amount, to 101.03.  Ten-year bund yields may fall toward 1.20 percent in the
first quarter of 2013, Jacq said.  Bunds Climbed  German securities climbed this week as reports signaling
 Europe ’s recession is deepening countered finance ministers’
Nov. 27 agreement to ease the terms of  Greece ’s bailout.  Unemployment in the 17-nation region rose to 11.7 percent
from 11.6 percent in September, the European Union’s  statistics
office  in Luxembourg said today. The  inflation rate  fell to 2.2
percent from 2.5 percent in October. That’s less than the median
forecast of 2.4 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of 38
economists.  Spanish 10-year bond yields fell three basis points to 5.31
percent today, having dropped 30 basis points this month and
yesterday touching the lowest level since March 20. The rate
earlier climbed as much as seven basis points to 5.41 percent.  “An ongoing drip feed of negative macro data certainly is
a potential trigger” for investors to sell Spanish bonds, said
 Richard McGuire , a senior rates strategist at Rabobank
International in London.  Similar-maturity Italian bond yields fell six basis points
to 4.50 percent. They dropped to 4.47 percent yesterday, the
least in almost two years.  Core Countries  Austria’s 10-year rate reached 1.732 percent and Belgium’s
fell to 2.15 percent, the lowest levels since Bloomberg began
collecting the data in 1993.  “In the core countries, the Austrias, the Belgiums,
there’s not that much juice left to be squeezed out of those
oranges,”  Andrew Bosomworth , managing director at Pimco, which
runs the world’s biggest bond fund, told  Mark Barton  on
Bloomberg Television’s “Countdown” in  Frankfurt .  Volatility on Greek bonds was the highest in developed
markets today, followed by those of  Switzerland , according to
measures of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt, the spread
between two- and 10-year securities, and credit default swaps.  The rate on Greek debt due February 2023 fell 19 basis
points to 16.129 percent, with the price rising to 35.275
percent of face value.  German bonds returned 3.8 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
debt gained 5.1 percent and  Italy ’s earned 20 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
