Business activity in the U.S.
expanded in November for the first time in three months, showing
superstorm Sandy is less damaging to the economy nationally.  The MNI Chicago Report’s business barometer rose to 50.4
from 49.9 in October. A reading of 50 is the dividing line
between expansion and contraction. The median estimate of 53
economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the gauge would rise
to 50.5.  The reading contrasts with earlier reports from the
Philadelphia and  New York  region that showed the largest
Atlantic storm ever to hit the U.S. had halted manufacturing in
that part of the country. At the same time, the prospect that
lawmakers will be unable to avert $607 billion in automatic tax
increases and spending cuts at the beginning of 2013 may prevent
the economy from strengthening further.  It’s “better than what we’ve been seeing,”  Carl Riccadonna , senior U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities
Inc. in New York, said before the report. The economy “is
lukewarm right now.”  Projections in the Bloomberg survey ranged from 48 to 53.  To contact the reporter on this story:
