Mexican swap rates fell to a two-
week low after the central bank damped speculation that it may
boost borrowing costs to contain inflation.  One-year swap rates dropped five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 4.91 percent today, the lowest closing
level since Nov. 16, according to data from JPMorgan Chase & Co.
The peso depreciated 0.2 percent to 12.9667 per  U.S. dollar ,
paring its monthly rally to 1 percent.  The central bank left its target lending rate at a record
low 4.5 percent, saying in a statement that it may still raise
borrowing costs if inflation doesn’t ease while eliminating an
assertion that it would do so “soon.”  Policy makers sounded “less hawkish,”  Pedro Tuesta , a
senior Latin America economist at 4Cast Inc., said in a phone
interview from  Washington . The falling swap rates show “reduced
bets” on increased borrowing costs.  The central bank bank’s board held the overnight lending
rate at an all-time low for a 31st consecutive meeting, as the
economy grew in the third quarter at the slowest pace in more
than a year and inflation slowed toward policy makers’ target.
Twenty-one out of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected the
bank to stay on hold. One economist forecast a quarter-
percentage point increase.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 fell seven basis points,
or 0.07 percentage point, to 5.52 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.74 centavo to 139.30
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
