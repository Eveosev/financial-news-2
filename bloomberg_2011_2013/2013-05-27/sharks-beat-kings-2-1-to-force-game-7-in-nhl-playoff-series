The San Jose Sharks held off the
defending Stanley Cup-champion Los Angeles Kings 2-1 to force a
decisive Game 7 in their National Hockey League playoff series.  The Chicago Blackhawks will try to push the other Western
Conference series to a seventh game tonight as they visit the
Detroit Red Wings, who lead the best-of-seven series 3-2.  The Sharks beat the Kings last night by a 2-1 score for the
third time in as many games in San Jose, with  Joe Thornton  and
T.J. Galiardi scoring goals for the hosts. The home team has won
each of the first six games, with Game 7 scheduled for May 28 in
Los Angeles.  “It’s followed the script -- home team wins, back and
forth,” Sharks coach Todd McLellan said at a news conference.
“It’s time for us to get there and change the story. They
earned the right for home ice. It’s our job to take it away.”  After being shut out in Los Angeles in Game 5, the Sharks
jumped out to a 1-0 lead last night as Thornton scored a power-play goal six minutes, nine seconds into the first period.
Thornton’s goal came after the Kings’  Mike Richards  and Anze Kopitar went to the penalty box 14 seconds apart.  Galiardi added a goal 4:10 into the second period for the
Sharks before  Dustin Brown  got the Kings’ lone goal with 6:07
left in the period. Sharks goaltender  Antti Niemi  stopped all
eight Los Angeles shots he faced in the final period.  The Pittsburgh Penguins and  Boston Bruins  meet in the
Eastern Conference finals for a spot in the Stanley Cup Final.  To contact the reporter on this story:
