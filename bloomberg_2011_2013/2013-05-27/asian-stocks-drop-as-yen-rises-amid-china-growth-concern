Asian  stocks  headed for their longest
losing streak since November as a stronger yen weakened the
profit outlook for Japanese exporters and China signaled it will
tolerate slower growth.  Nissan Motor Co., Asia’s third-largest carmaker, slid 6.8
percent in  Tokyo  as the yen gained against the dollar. Softbank
Corp. dropped 4.1 percent after U.S. Senator Charles Schumer
said the carrier’s $20.1 billion bid for Sprint Nextel Corp.

manufacturer projected a profit drop.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 1.2 percent to 136.97 as
of 5:11 p.m in Hong Kong, extending losses for a fifth day
toward the lowest since April 23. About three stocks fell for
every two that rose and all 10 industry groups on the gauge
retreated. The measure lost 2.7 percent last week, the most
since July, as speculation grew the Federal Reserve will reduce
its bond purchases as the economy improves and China
manufacturing data missed estimates.  “I wouldn’t be putting any risk on now,” Keith Poore, New
Zealand-based head of investment strategy at AMP Capital, which
has about $126 billion in assets under management, said in a
phone interview from Wellington. “We’ve had confirmation from
 China  that the recovery is going to be very shallow by their
standards. In Japan, we expect more volatility, and with bond
yields that low you don’t need a big move to end up with a
capital loss. Those that are overweight risk assets might want
to take some more risk off.”  Japanese Slump  Japan’s  Topix Index (TPX)  slid 3.4 percent, extending the worst
weekly decline in more than a year. The measure has lost 9.6
percent from May 22, when it closed at the highest level since

easing policies from the Bank of  Japan . The Standard & Poor’s

8.5 percent this year.  There’s “no sign at this point of excessively bullish
expectations in asset markets or in the activities of financial
institutions,” BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said yesterday in
Tokyo.  China Growth  Australia ’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  fell 0.5 percent and New

income for Chinese industrial companies last month rose 9.3
percent from a year earlier to 437 billion  yuan  ($71.3 billion)
after a 5.3 percent increase in March, the National Bureau of
Statistics said in Beijing. Profit in the first four months of
the year climbed 11.4 percent to 1.61 trillion yuan, it said.  Stronger profit growth may spur investment in factories and
equipment, helping sustain growth in the world’s second-biggest
economy as the government avoids adding stimulus. China’s
President Xi Jinping signaled a tolerance for slower expansion
to reduce environmental damage.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed. Markets in the U.S. and U.K. are closed for holidays.  A gain of 7.1 percent in 2013 on the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index through the end of last week left the measure trading at

compiled by Bloomberg.  Japanese exporters declined as the yen climbed 0.4 percent

Bravia televisions and PlayStation game consoles, sank 6.3
percent to 2,013 yen.  SoftBank sank 4.1 percent to 5,170 yen.  New York  Senator
Schumer wrote to the Treasury Department that SoftBank’s
purchase of Sprint could open “a backdoor for hackers”
targeting the U.S. because of a possible reliance on Chinese
networking equipment.  David Jones Ltd. (DJS)  slid 0.8 percent to A$2.56, fifth straight
decline, after the Australian retailer said third-quarter sales
dropped 3.4 percent on the previous year. That compares with a
forecast 1 percent decline.  361 Degrees International fell 7.7 percent to HK$1.93 in
