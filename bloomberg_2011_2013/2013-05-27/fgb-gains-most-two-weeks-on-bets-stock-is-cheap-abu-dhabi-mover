First Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB)  rose the most in
almost two weeks on investor bets the shares of the bank
controlled by  Abu Dhabi ’s ruling family are cheap.  The shares  gained 1.8 percent, the largest advance since
May 14, to 14.20 dirhams at the close in Abu Dhabi. The stock
was the biggest gainer  by index points  on the benchmark  ADX
General Index (ADSMI) , which increased 1.2 percent. The benchmark index
declined 3.8 percent in the previous five days.  First Gulf slumped 9.4 percent in the previous seven days,
closing yesterday at a 16 percent discount to the shares’
average 12-month price estimate of 16.69 dirhams, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Kuwait-based Global Investment House
raised the bank’s price estimate to 15.34 dirhams yesterday. The
shares trade at 9.5 times estimated earnings that compares with
11.7 for the STOXX 600 Banks Index, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  “Given that it has fallen from over 15 dirhams, it is
attracting some buyers,” said Amer Khan, a Dubai-based director
at Shuaa Asset Management. “The U.A.E. as a whole has tended to
attract bids on any sizable pullback.”  First Gulf, which reported an 12 percent jump in first-quarter profit, will probably post the U.A.E.’s fastest loan
growth in 2013, helping boost profit, EFG-Hermes Holding SAE
said in December. The bank will post a  7 percent increase  in net
income, according to the  mean estimate  of 13 analysts on
Bloomberg.  Twelve  analysts  recommend investors buy the shares, while
five say hold and one says sell, according  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  The stock’s rally of 22 percent this year compares with a
gain of 32 percent for the ADX General Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
