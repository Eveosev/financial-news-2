Iceland central bank Governor Mar Gudmundsson said the island needs a new strategy to lift its
 capital controls  as currency auctions have fallen short of
expectations.  “Iceland’s balance of payments crisis can lead to
considerable pressure on the krona and even the insolvency of
some parties,” he said today a meeting in Reykjavik.  The nation placed restrictions on its currency in 2008
after the collapse of its three largest banks sent the krona
down as much as 80 percent against the euro offshore. The bank
has been seeking to ease a currency overhang by using dual
auctions designed to take pressure off the krona while promoting
investments in the economy.  Parliament in March abandoned a 2013 deadline for the
removal of capital controls, which are blocking as much as $8
billion in assets from being offloaded. The new government,
which took power last week, has targeted a swifter removal of
the controls, which are hampering foreign investments.  Gudmundsson said today that the auctions had gone slower
than anticipated and that the amount of volatile krona assets
had been cut by 272 billion kronur ($2.2 billion) since 2008.  The bank has been discussing a potential exit tax with the
 finance ministry , he also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
