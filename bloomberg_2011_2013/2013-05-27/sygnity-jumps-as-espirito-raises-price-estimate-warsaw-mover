Sygnity SA climbed to a two-month
high as Banco Espirito Santo de Investimento SA raised its price
estimate for the Polish software maker after stronger earnings
boosted the profit outlook.  The  shares  advanced as much as 2.5 percent and traded 1.5
percent higher at 16.45 zloty by 3:22 p.m. in Warsaw, the
highest level since March 15. Trading volume was more than
double the stock’s three-month daily average, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The Portuguese brokerage increased Sygnity’s price estimate
to 24 zloty from 20.9 zloty and kept its buy recommendation on
the shares “due to better than previously expected
profitability and cost control, which we see as sustainable,”
Konrad Ksiezopolski, an analyst at Espirito in Warsaw, said in
an e-mailed report dated today.  Sygnity’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, rose to 8 million zloty ($2.5 million)
from 0.4 million zloty in the January-March period a year
earlier, while sales fell 11 percent to 96.7 million zloty, the
company said in a statement on its website May 20.  The fiscal second-quarter earnings “demonstrated that
Sygnity is moving in the right direction and has managed to
optimize costs and improve its revenue mix, resulting in higher
profitability,’ Ksiezopolski said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
