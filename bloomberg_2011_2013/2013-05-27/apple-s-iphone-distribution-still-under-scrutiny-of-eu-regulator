Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s distribution practices
for iPhones continue to be examined by the European Union’s
antitrust regulator as part of a preliminary investigation, the
European Commission said today.  The regulator “has received information from industry
players concerning Apple’s distribution practices for iPhones,”
Antoine Colombani, spokesman for Competition Commissioner
 Joaquin Almunia , said by e-mail.  “We are currently examining the situation,” Colombani
said. “This does not prejudge the commission’s position on the
issues raised.”  Antitrust officials at the Brussels-based commission said
in March they were looking at whether Apple’s distribution
methods for iPhones and iPad tablets were anti-competitive.
Apple last year settled an EU antitrust probe into e-books
pricing after it agreed to change agreements with four
publishers.  The Cupertino, California-based company previously ended
another antitrust case by pledging to reduce prices for U.K.
iTunes music downloads. The EU closed a probe over restrictions
on iPhone applications in 2010.  Alan Hely, a spokesman for Apple in London, declined to
comment beyond the company’s statement from March that Apple’s
contracts “fully comply with local laws wherever we do
business, including in the EU.”  The Financial Times yesterday reported the EU had sent a
questionnaire to EU mobile network operators focusing on Apple’s
distribution terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
