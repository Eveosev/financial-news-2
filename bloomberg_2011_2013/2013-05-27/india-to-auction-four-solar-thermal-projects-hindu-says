India  plans to auction four solar-thermal power projects with a combined 120 megawatts of
capacity, the Hindu Business Line reported, without citing where
it got the information.  The government-run Solar Energy Corp. of India will call
for bids in a year, the newspaper reported. The projects will be
eligible for 10.2 billion rupees ($183 million) of government
grants, it said.  Solar Energy Corp. has set a tariff of 5.83 rupees per
kilowatt-hour for the power generated. Developers offering the
biggest discount to that rate will win the auction, the paper
said.  Seven solar-thermal plants that India auctioned in December
2010 failed to meet a completion deadline this month due to a
lack of water, technical delays and financing issues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
