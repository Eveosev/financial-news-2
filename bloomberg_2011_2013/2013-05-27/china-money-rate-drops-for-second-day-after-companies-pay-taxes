China ’s money-market rate dropped for
a second day on speculation cash supply will improve once
companies have finished paying taxes for the month.  “In the short term, the cash shortage will ease,” said
Cheng Qingsheng, a bond analyst at Evergrowing Bank Co. in
Shanghai, adding that tax payments in April and May are the
year’s biggest.  Cheng estimates local firms paid a total of 500 billion
 yuan  ($81.6 billion) in taxes in May. The People’s Bank of China
asked lenders today to submit orders for 28-day repurchase
contracts and gauged demand for three-month  bills , all used to
drain funds from the financial system, according to a trader
required to bid at the auctions. It also requested orders for
seven- and 14-day reverse-repurchase agreements.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, declined eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 4.08 percent as of 10:28 a.m. in Shanghai,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. It touched a one-month high of 4.5
percent on May 23.  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, was unchanged at 3.27
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  --Judy Chen. Editors: Simon Harvey, Robin Ganguly  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
