Bank of Japan minutes show the
concern of “a few” board members that inflation expectations
may fail to flow through to actual price increases, leaving the
BOJ short of its 2 percent goal through March 2016.  Those policy makers say it’s “highly uncertain whether
changes in inflation expectations would lead to a rise in the
actual rate of inflation,” according to the record of an April
26 meeting, released today in  Tokyo . According to JPMorgan Chase
& Co., the BOJ uses the term “a few” to mean two.  Japanese stocks tumbled today, adding to volatility that
threatens to sap confidence in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s
campaign to revive the world’s third-biggest economy. The Topix
Index fell 3 percent as of 10 a.m. local time, adding to a 6.9
percent one-day plunge last week that was the biggest since the
March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The gauge is still up 35
percent for the year to date.  Before today’s minutes, the BOJ had already disclosed that
at least two members see inflation of less than 1 percent in the
fiscal year ending March 2016. The board’s median estimate is
1.9 percent, excluding the effects of a planned sales tax
increase.  Board members discussed perceptions of a contradiction
between applying downward pressure to  interest rates  through
large-scale purchases of  government bonds  and seeking to fuel
inflation, which would lead to pressure for higher yields. “A
few” members said this had led to fluctuations in financial
markets. One said that potential instability remained in the
 bond market .  To contact the reporter on this story:
