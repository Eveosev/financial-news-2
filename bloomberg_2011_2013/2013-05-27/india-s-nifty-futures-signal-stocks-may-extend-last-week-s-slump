Indian (SENSEX)  stocks advanced the most since
May 15 after last week’s drop in the benchmark index lured
investors.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)  led the gains.  The S&P BSE Sensex rose 1.7 percent to 20,030.77 at the
close in Mumbai. Reliance, the owner of the world’s largest
refining complex and the second-biggest stock in the gauge by
 weighting , jumped the most in eight months after discovering a
new natural gas field in its biggest block off India’s eastern
coast.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , the nation’s largest mobile-phone
operator, soared 3.6 percent.  The Sensex dropped 2.9 percent last week amid speculation
global central banks may taper stimulus. The decline dragged the
gauge’s  valuation  to 13.53 times  projected 12-month profits  on
May 24, a three-week low. The Sensex rallied to more than a two-year high May 17 amid monetary easing by policy makers from
India to Europe, and a slide in oil and gold costs that lowered
concern on the nation’s record current-account deficit.  “Valuations are looking better after last week’s fall,”
 Gajendra Nagpal , chief executive officer at Unicon Financial
Intermediaries, said by phone from New Delhi. “Increasingly
investors are convinced that a softness in commodity prices will
set in a virtuous cycle of lower inflation and interest rates,
and higher corporate profits.”  Reliance Industries rallied 5.3 percent to 828.3 rupees,
its steepest climb since Sept. 14. Reliance, with partners  BP
Plc (BP/)  and Canada’s Niko Resources Ltd., announced on May 24 a
“significant” discovery of gas in a deposit that lies under
the biggest producing areas in the KG-D6 block in the Bay of
Bengal. The find may help billionaire Mukesh Ambani-controlled
Reliance reverse a three-year decline in production from the
block and boost earnings that have dropped in four of the last
six quarters.  Reliance Upgrade  “This discovery opens up a new liquid-rich gas condensate
play offshore India,”  Neil Beveridge , a Hong Kong-based analyst
at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., wrote in a report today, while
upgrading Reliance to ‘outperform’ from ‘market perform’.  Bharti Airtel surged 3.6 percent to 309.15 rupees.  Housing
Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the biggest mortgage lender, added
2.6 percent to 929.5 rupees.  Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (SUNP) ,
India’s most valuable drugmaker, increased 4.6 percent to
1,013.7 rupees, a record.  Coal India Ltd. (COAL)  climbed for the fifth day, adding 1.2
percent to 313.8 rupees. The world’s biggest producer of the
fuel said after market hours its fourth-quarter profit climbed
35 percent to 54.1 billion rupees, beating analysts’ estimates.  Earnings Scorecard  Profit at four of the 22 Sensex companies that have posted
March-quarter results so far has  trailed  analysts’  estimates ,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The scorecard excludes Tata
Steel Ltd., which posted a loss. Net income at about 43 percent
of the 30 index companies missed forecasts in the three months
ended December, compared with 40 percent in the previous two
quarters.  Britannia Industries Ltd. (BRIT) , a biscuit maker which is not
part of the Sensex, jumped 16 percent to a record 665.65 rupees
after fourth-quarter profit surged 66 percent. Drugmaker
 Wockhardt Ltd. (WPL)  gained 3.6 percent, ending a six-day 33 percent
plunge, after reporting fourth-quarter profit of 3.35 billion
rupees compared with a loss of 1.92 billion rupees a year ago.  “This earnings season has been much better than expected
and that will support the rally,” said Unicon’s Nagpal  Monetary easing by global central banks has stoked inflows
into emerging markets including India, with foreigners having
bought a net $14.5 billion of local shares in 2013, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Flows have accelerated since the
 Reserve Bank  of India lowered interest  rates  on May 3.  The Sensex, which has  risen  3.1 percent in 2013, trades at
13.8 times  projected 12-month profits . Volume on the gauge was
32 percent lower than the 30-day average. The 50-stock  CNX Nifty
Index (NIFTY)  on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. added 1.7
percent to 6,083.15. Its May futures settled at 6,083.45.  To contact the reporter on this story:
