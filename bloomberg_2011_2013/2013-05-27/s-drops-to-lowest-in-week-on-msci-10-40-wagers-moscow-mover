OAO Mobile TeleSystems,  Russia ’s
largest mobile-phone company, fell to the lowest level in more
than a week as funds sold the stock on bets  MSCI Inc. (MSCI)  will cut
its weighting in a benchmark gauge.  MTS retreated 1.4 percent to 261.65 rubles by the close in
Moscow, the lowest since May 16. The number of shares traded was
equivalent to about 51 percent of the three-month average. U.S.
and U.K. markets are closed today for a public holiday.  MSCI will annouce it’s cutting the combined weighting of
MTS’s American depositary receipts and AFK Sistema’s global
depositary receipts to 4.5 percent from 9 percent in the Russia
10/40 Index after the market close today, according to an e-mailed note from VTB Capital today. The rebalancing will take
effect June 3.  OAO Magnit (MGNT) ’s GDRs will be lifted to a 9 percent
weighting, replacing the two stocks in the gauge’s top four.
That may trigger $251 million of outflows from MTS, $59 million
from Sistema and $331 million of inflows to Magnit, VTB said.  “The expected announcement tonight may be one of the
factors behind the stock’s decline,” Ilya Piterskiy, an analyst
at VTB Capital, which manages about 90 billion rubles ($2.9
billion), said by e-mail today. “For funds that track the
index, a sharp cut in MTS’s weighting can be a signal to sell.”  Sistema dropped 0.8 percent to 26.90 rubles in Moscow.
Magnit surged 48 percent in Moscow this year, Sistema added 5.8
percent and MTS increased 6.4 percent.  While  New York  and London trading is closed today, many
funds hold Moscow-listed MTS shares in their portfolios,
Piterskiy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
