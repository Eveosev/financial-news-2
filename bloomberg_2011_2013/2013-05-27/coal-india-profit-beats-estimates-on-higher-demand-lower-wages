Coal India Ltd. (COAL) , the world’s biggest
miner of the fuel, reported a better-than-expected 35 percent
increase in fourth-quarter profit, aided by increased shipments
and a decline in wage costs.  Net income climbed to 54.1 billion rupees ($973 million),
or 8.58 rupees a share, in the three months ended March 31 from
40.13 billion rupees, or 6.41 rupees, a year earlier, the
company said today in a statement. The median of 34 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was a profit of 49.6 billion
rupees. Sales rose 2.5 percent to 199 billion rupees.  Coal  India , which accounts for more than 80 percent of the
nation’s production of the fuel, plans to boost output this year
to bridge the gap between demand and local supplies. The company
had a cash reserve of 622.4 billion rupees as of March 31.  Shipments rose to 130 million metric tons in the quarter,
while output declined to 143.3 million tons from 144.6 million
tons a year earlier, the company said in the statement. Employee
expenses dropped 21 percent to 74.7 billion rupees.  Coal India  shares  gained 1.2 percent to 313.80 rupees at
the close of trading in Mumbai. The key S&P BSE Sensex rose 1.7
percent. The earnings were announced after trading ended.  To contact the reporter on this story:
