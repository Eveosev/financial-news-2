The Dominican Republic central bank
cut the benchmark  interest rate  for the fourth time in 12 months
yesterday after growth in the Caribbean’s largest economy slowed
and consumer prices dipped.  Policy makers led by bank Governor Hector Valdez Albizu
lowered the overnight rate 0.75 percentage point to 4.25 percent
and said they didn’t see any inflationary pressures in the next
few months, according to a statement on the bank’s website. The
reduction brings the drop in the key rate since May 2012 to 2.5
percentage points.  The central bank reported on May 24 that the economy
expanded 0.3 percent in the first quarter from the year earlier,
less than it had expected and down from 3.9 percent in the
previous three months. Consumer prices slid 0.06 percent in
April, the first decline in nine months. Annual inflation was
4.9 percent, within the central bank’s target range of 5 percent
plus or minus one percentage point.  “Production has been below its potential capacity and
during the January-March quarter the growth rate was below the
average from previous years as a result of weakened internal
demand,” policy makers said. “Macroeconomic models indicate
that, if measures are not taken, production would remain below
potential until the end of 2014.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
