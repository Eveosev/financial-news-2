Slowing inflation in the U.S. will
curb an increase in bond yields, while  interest rates  are likely
to stay subdued for “a very long time,” according to David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors Inc.  “Eventually, bond yields will be higher, maybe much
higher, but the process is a gradual one,” Kotok, whose firm
oversees $2.2 billion, wrote in a note to clients May 24. “That
means some tactical hedging in bond portfolios is appropriate.
Panic selling of bonds is not,” according to Kotok, who is
based in Sarasota,  Florida .  Consumer prices rose 1.1 percent in April from a year
earlier, the smallest gain since November 2010, according to
Labor Department data. The  U.S. economy  faces high unemployment
and government spending cuts, so tightening policy too soon
would endanger the recovery, Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said last week in testimony to the Joint Economic
Committee of Congress in  Washington .  U.S. 10-year  rates  climbed as high as 2.07 percent last
week, approaching 2.1 percent for the first time since April
2012, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. Treasuries were
closed today for a public holiday.  “Interest rates are very low and likely to stay low for a
very long time,” Kotok wrote in his report. Slow inflation will
also support stocks, he said.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed to a record last
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
