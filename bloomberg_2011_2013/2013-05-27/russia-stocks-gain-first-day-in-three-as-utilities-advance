Russian  equities  rose for the first
time in three days as power stocks advanced, paring the
benchmark stock gauge’s 12 percent slide from this year’s high.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 0.5 percent to 1,387.87 by 10:27 a.m.
in Moscow after a 1.5 percent retreat last week. Utilities
increased the most of nine industry groups, rising 1.2 percent.
EON  Russia , a power producer controlled by  Germany ’s biggest
utility, jumped 1.6 percent to 2.5867 rubles. OAO Russian Grids
rose 1 percent to 1.358 rubles.  Crude slipped 0.6 percent to $93.58 a barrel in  New York ,
declining for a fifth day. Markets in the UK and U.S. are closed
today for public holidays. The volume of shares traded on the
Micex was 22 percent below its 30-day average, while 10-day
price swings climbed to 29.023, the highest since Sept. 26.  The Micex tumbled the most in a year on May 23, after
manufacturing in  China  unexpectedly contracted and as concern
the U.S. Federal Reserve will crimp stimulus measures curbed
appetite for riskier assets. Russia left its  main interest rates 
unchanged for an eighth month this month, brushing off
government calls for lower borrowing costs.  Outgoing Bank Rossii Chairman Sergey Ignatiev has limited
room for policy easing with inflation more than a percentage
point above target, putting him at odds with an international
push for monetary stimulus this month.  Russia-dedicated funds posted a third consecutive week of
inflows in the period ended May 22, the longest stretch since
the third quarter of 2012,  Cameron Brandt , research director at
EPFR Global, said on May 24.  Russia’s equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
 emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg. The Micex trades at 5.2
times its 12-month estimated earnings and has lost 5.9 percent
this year, compared with a 10.5 multiple for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index, which has dropped 2.6 percent in the period.  The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  added 0.4 percent to
1,393.47. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in  stock futures , declined 2.2 percent to 23.97. The
Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded Russian
companies in the U.S. retreated 0.7 percent to 92.01 on May 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
