Renaissance Capital , the investment
bank owned by Russian billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov , cut
coverage of more than 60 companies in Russia, Kazakhstan,
Ukraine, Africa and Hong Kong.  Stocks axed include Russian retail companies OAO Rosinter
and OAO Synergy, agriculture producers OAO Razgulay and OAO
Rusgrain Holding, according to an e-mailed report today. Real
estate companies, AFI Development Plc, RGI International Ltd.
and Mirland Development Corp. will no longer be covered. London-listed energy companies Dragon Oil Plc and Tullow Oil Plc were
dropped as were Hong Kong-listed China Petroleum & Chemical
Corp. and PetroChina Co.  The changes were made “with a view to providing best
coverage of those names that are of more interest to our core
institutional client base,”  David Nangle , head of research,
wrote in e-mailed comments. No analysts have been fired as a
result of the coverage review, Nangle said.  RenCap shuttered sales, trading and research operations in
Almaty, Kiev, Bejing, Hong Kong and some offices in Africa last
year. RenCap, as the Moscow-based bank is known, is paring back
co-founder  Stephen Jennings ’s expansion into faster-growing
emerging markets. Prokhorov, who bought almost 50 percent of
RenCap for $500 million more than four years ago, ousted
Jennings in November after rebuffing a request for funding amid
losses, two people familiar with the matter said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
