Hong Kong police arrested a fifth
person in its investigation of Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange
Ltd., the failed commodities market set up by its chairman and
largest shareholder  Barry Cheung .  Police arrested a 35-year-old woman with the surname Zheng
yesterday on suspicion of possession of false instruments,
according to the Police Public Relations Branch. Four men were
arrested last week as part of the case begun by the Securities
and Futures Commission into suspected financial irregularities
at HKMEx.  HKMEx, as the exchange is known, surrendered its trading
license this month after failing to attract sufficient revenue
to support its operations. Cheung resigned from all public
service positions, including the city’s executive council,
because he’s under police investigation, the government said in
a statement May 24.  Cheung resigned as an independent non-executive director of
 AIA Group Ltd. (1299) , the insurer said in a May 25 statement, and as
an independent director at United Co. Rusal, the Russian
aluminum producer said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
