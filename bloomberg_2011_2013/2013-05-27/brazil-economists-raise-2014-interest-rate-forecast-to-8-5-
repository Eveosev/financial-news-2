Brazil  economists increased their
2014 benchmark  interest rate  forecast for the first time since
March as policy makers seek to slow inflation in the world’s
second-largest emerging market.  The central bank board will raise the Selic rate to 8.50
percent by the end of next year, down from the previous week’s
forecast of 8.25 percent, according to a central bank survey of
100 analysts published today. Economists kept unchanged
estimates that borrowing costs will climb to 8.25 percent by the
end of this year from today’s 7.5 percent.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration is seeking to
cool inflation without sacrificing economic growth. Central
bankers this week will raise borrowing costs by 25 basis points
for the second straight monetary policy meeting to 7.75 percent,
according to the median estimate of 37 economists polled by
Bloomberg.  Brazil’s $2.5 trillion economy will expand by 2.93 percent
this year, down from the previous estimate of 2.98 percent,
according to today’s survey. That compares to the central bank’s
forecast of 3.1 percent growth.  Analysts today raised their 12-month inflation forecast to
5.66 percent from last week’s 5.64 percent. Brazil’s annual
inflation through mid-May reached 6.46 percent. The central bank
targets annual inflation at 4.5 percent, plus or minus two
percentage points  To contact the reporter on this story:
