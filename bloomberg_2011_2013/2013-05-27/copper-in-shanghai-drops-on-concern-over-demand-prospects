Copper in  Shanghai  declined on
speculation that Chinese leaders’ tolerance for a slower growth
rate will curb demand growth at the largest user.  Metal for delivery in September fell as much as 1.3 percent
to 52,230  yuan  ($8,523) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange and was at 52,560 yuan at 10:02 a.m. local time. The
most-active contract lost 0.2 percent last week, falling for a
second week in a row. The London Metal Exchange is closed today
for a public holiday.  China’s President  Xi Jinping  said last week the country
won’t sacrifice the environment to ensure short-term growth,
while Premier  Li Keqiang  said growth in the first quarter was
“within reasonable range.” A  Purchasing Managers ’ Index for
China released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics on May
23 showed a preliminary reading of 49.6 for May, below 50, the
expansion level.  “The concern is how demand will be after the peak-consumption season for metals comes to an end, and as leaders
become unwilling to add any stimulus,” Xiong Dabiao, an analyst
at Minmetals Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai.  Profits of nonferrous metals mining and smelting companies
declined 3.5 percent and 8.3 percent in the first four months
from a year ago, according to  data  from the National Bureau of
Statistics today.  The July futures contract on the Comex in  New York  was
little changed at $3.2945 a pound. Net-short  positions , or
wagers on falling prices, held by funds fell to 9,033 futures
and options contracts as of May 21 from 13,115 a week earlier,
according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
