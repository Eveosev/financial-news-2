Spanish government bonds advanced for
the first time in three days after the biggest selloff in seven
months last week.  Italian bonds rose as European equities climbed.  Germany ’s
bunds declined as the nation alloted 2.125 billion euros ($2.8
billion) of 12-month bills at an auction.  France ’s two-year
notes were little changed as the country sold 7.79 billion euros
of securities due between three and 12 months. Markets in the
U.K. and U.S. are closed for public holidays.  “The overall trend for lower yields remains in place,”
said Allan von Mehren, chief analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in
Copenhagen. “There’s still a hunt for yield and a lot of
liquidity in the system. All eyes are going to be on how
European equities are holding up.”  Spain (GSPG10YR) ’s 10-year bond yield fell nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 4.33 percent at 4:06 p.m. London time. The
yield climbed 21 basis points last week, the most since the
period ending Oct. 26. The 5.4 percent security due in January
2023 advanced 0.705, or 7.05 euros per 1,000-euro face amount,
to 108.275.  The rate on similar-maturity  Italian (GBTPGR10)  bonds also dropped
nine basis points, to 4.05 percent.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.2 percent after sliding
1.7 percent last week. Spanish 10-year bonds have moved in the
same direction as Europe’s benchmark stock index for each of the
last seven trading days.  German Auction  Germany’s 10-year yield increased three basis points to
1.46 percent. Yields rose to 1.47 percent on May 24, the highest
since March 15.  Germany auctioned one-year bills to yield 0.001 percent,
compared with 0.002 percent on April 29.  The Netherlands is scheduled to sell as much as 3 billion
euros of 10-year bonds tomorrow, while Belgium and  Italy  are
also due to sell debt.  The  yield  on French two-year notes was 0.24 percent.  Volatility on Austrian bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of  Belgium  and the Netherlands,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  German government bonds handed investors a loss of 1
percent this month through May 24, according to indexes compiled
by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. French securities slipped 0.7 percent and Spanish
debt dropped 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
