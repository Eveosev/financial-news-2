Pandora A/S (PNDORA)  was the second-biggest
gainer among benchmark stocks in Copenhagen today after Nordea
Bank AB said declines in the price of gold and silver will lower
costs at the Danish jewelry maker.  Pandora rose as much as 2.2 percent, the biggest advance in
the Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen 20 Index after Vestas Wind Systems
A/S. Pandora’s stock rose 1.5 percent to 203 kroner at 9:41 a.m.
in the Danish capital with trading volume at 16 percent of the
three-month daily average.  Gold price futures have dropped 5.3 percent this month,
adding to April’s 7.8 percent decline, as some investors lose
faith in the metal as a store of value amid an improving U.S.
economy and a rally in equities. Silver spot prices have plunged
about 19 percent since April 9.  “Silver and gold are by far the most important raw
materials in Pandora’s production of jewelry,” Nordea said
today in a note to clients. “With the current development,
Pandora will be able to look forward to significant future cost
savings.”  Pandora’s shares jumped 12 percent on May 14 when the
Glostrup, Denmark-based company reported first-quarter profit
that beat analyst estimates. Eight days later, the stock dropped
11 percent as its majority shareholder, Prometheus Invest ApS,
sold 13 million shares to institutional investors for about 2.6
billion kroner ($450 million).  “We see the recent share price decline in Pandora as a
good opportunity to buy because the first-quarter earnings
report confirmed that the growth story is back,” Nordea said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
