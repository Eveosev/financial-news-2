Hedge funds and other money managers
raised  bullish bets  on  Brent crude  by 16,460 contracts in the
week ended May 21, according to data from ICE Futures  Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 146,679 lots,
the London-based exchange said today in its weekly Commitment of
Traders report. The increase marks the fourth weekly gain and
brings the level for net long positions to the highest since the
week ended Feb. 26.  Bearish positions by  producers , merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 350,842,
according to the report. That is near to the level reached in
the week ended May 7, when bearish bets were at their highest
since January 2011, the starting point for the data.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators such as  hedge funds  and
institutional investors, as well as commercial companies that
buy or sell futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and
investors follow changes in speculatorsâ€™ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
