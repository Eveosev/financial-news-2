Palm oil  traded near the highest
level in six weeks on speculation that demand may increase ahead
of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, boosting exports from
Malaysia, the world’s second-largest producer.  The contract for August delivery was little changed at
2,368 ringgit ($781) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives at the midday break in Kuala Lumpur. Futures closed
at 2,371 ringgit on May 23, the highest level for the most
active contract since April 10.  Purchases from the Middle East and South Asia usually climb
before Ramadan, which starts in July this year, when communal
meals boost total consumption. Shipments from Malaysia fell 5.2
percent to 1.06 million tons in the first 25 days of May from
the same period in April, surveyor Intertek said May 25. That
compares with a 9.4 percent drop in the first 20 days of this
month and a 17 percent decline in the first 10 days.  “People are expecting fresh buying,” Rajesh Modi, a
trader at Sprint Exim Pte., said by phone from  Singapore .
“After June 15, exports will be at a much higher pace” as
Ramadan demand picks up, he said.  Demand from China may continue to rebound as the weather
gets warmer, state-owned researcher Grain.gov.cn said in an e-mail today. Inventories of palm oil stored in the country’s
major ports totaled 1.36 million tons, compared with 1.35
million tons a week earlier, it said.  Refined palm oil for September delivery was little changed
at 6,110  yuan  ($997) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange ,
while  soybean oil  fell 0.3 percent to 7,508 yuan.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans for July delivery
closed 1.6 percent lower at $14.7625 a bushel on May 24 and
soybean oil for the same month lost 0.9 percent to 49.24 cents a
pound. The market is closed today for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
