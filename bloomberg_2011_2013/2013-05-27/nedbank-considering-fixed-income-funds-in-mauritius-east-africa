Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)  is considering
starting fixed-income funds in Mauritius and  East Africa  similar
to ones it runs with parent  Old Mutual Plc (OML)  in Namibia.  The funds would hold securities with a maturity of less
than 2.5 years and may hold as much as $250 million to $300
million, Kevin Whitfield, head of African treasuries at Nedbank
Capital, said today in an interview in Marrakech, Morocco.
Nedbank will decide whether to open the fund in Mauritius by the
end of the year and by early 2014 for East Africa, he said.  “We’re considering looking at East africa and Mauritius,”
he said. “This is based on our experiences in Namibia, which is
managed in partnership by Old Mutual and supported by Nedbank.
We are looking to extend that model.”  The fund would aim to draw investors with dollars and euros
that want higher returns for short-term investments than those
offered by local banks. The goal would be returns of 1
percentage point to 1.5 percentage point above deposit rates in
those markets, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
