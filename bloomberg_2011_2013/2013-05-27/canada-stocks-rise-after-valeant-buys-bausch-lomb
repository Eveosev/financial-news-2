Holdings Inc. in an $8.7 billion deal, including debt.  Wi-Lan

quiet today,” said  Ian Nakamoto , director of research with
MacDougall MacDougall & MacTier Inc. in Toronto. He helps manage
$4 billion with the firm. “What I’d watch for is gold equities
and the gold price, they could get a bit of a lift if equity
markets are taking a pause here.”  “Valeant is an acquisition-driven company and the shares
will continue rising until they make a bad investment,”
Nakamoto said.  Health Care  Health-care stocks paced gains in the S&P/TSX, rising 7.4
percent as a group for the highest close since March 2000.

LLC. Valeant will also pay $4.2 billion to repay Bausch & Lomb

percent to C$4.65 after agreeing to a licensing deal with Dell.

including Dell, Apple Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. for copyright
