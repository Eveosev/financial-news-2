Australia  is the world’s happiest
nation based on criteria including income, jobs, housing and
health, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development said.  Australia led Sweden and  Canada , the Paris-based group’s
 Better Life Index  showed, when each of 11 categories surveyed in
36 nations is given equal weight.  More than 73 percent of people aged 15 to 64 in Australia
have a paid job, above the OECD average of 66 percent, while
 life expectancy  at birth in Australia is almost 82 years, two
years higher than the OECD average, the survey showed.  Australia, the only major developed nation to avoid the
2009 worldwide recession, remains at the top of the OECD index
even as a mining boom powering economic growth crests and the
government forecasts unemployment will rise to 5.75 percent by
June 2014, from 5.5 percent last month.  “Australia performs exceptionally well in measures of
well-being, as shown by the fact that it ranks among the top
countries in a large number of topics in the Better Life
Index,” the OECD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
