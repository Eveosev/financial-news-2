Nigeria’s  central bank  shouldn’t rush
to cut  interest rates  even as inflation is forecast to remain
within its target this year, Governor Lamido Sanusi said.  Rate reductions will depend on whether the government can
control spending, Sanusi said in an interview in Marrakech,
Morocco, where he is attending the annual meetings of the
 African Development Bank .  The Central Bank of Nigeria left its  policy rate  unchanged
at a record high of 12 percent on May 21, concerned by the
threat of rising spending as the government battles Islamist
insurgents in the northeast. Inflation has stayed under 10
percent for four consecutive months, meeting the bank’s target.  “The central bank shouldn’t rush into cutting rates and
then raising,” Sanusi said. “How much room we have to cut
depends on what happens in the fiscal space.”  Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said last week the
economy needs lower interest rates to help spur output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
