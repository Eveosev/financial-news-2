Saudi Arabian Oil Co. production rose
to a record 9.51 million barrels a day of oil last year, the
company said in its annual review. Reserves stood at 260.2
billion barrels.  Daily output for Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest state-run producer, rose 4.8 percent from 2011, according to the
review posted on Aramco’s website today. The annual total was
3.48 billion barrels. Reserves of crude oil and condensates rose
from 259.7 billion barrels the previous year, and deposits of
natural gas increased 0.8 percent to 284.8 trillion standard
cubic feet.  Aramco, the largest crude exporter, started pumping from
Manifa, the world’s fifth-largest oil field, on April 10 of this
year, seeking to replace declining output at other fields and
maintain the company’s production capacity at 12 million barrels
a day. Aramco is exploring more aggressively for natural gas, a
fuel used in power plants, to help meet growing domestic demand
for electricity and free more crude for export.  Exports of crude were 2.521 billion barrels for the year,
or about 6.9 million barrels a day. The kingdom sent 53.2
percent of its crude exports to Asia and 16.5 percent to the
U.S., the report showed.  Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, boosted production in 2012 to the
highest level in three decades amid supply disruptions from
Libya and a European Union embargo on shipments from Iran crude
that took effect on July 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
