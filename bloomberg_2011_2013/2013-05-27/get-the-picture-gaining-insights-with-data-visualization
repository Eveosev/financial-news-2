As the volume of data flowing into our organization increases, we have a growing need to find ways to identify important information and make it easier to understand and analyze.  
Leaders have always understood the power of images, and now data visualization is becoming an important tool for making sense of streams of complex data quickly. It can create a "shared view" of information to help groups analyze problems. And teams can make better maps of information as they work to execute in a fast-moving environment.  In this HBR webinar  Jeremy Howard  discusses how you can build the basics and leverage a growing crowd of professional data visualizers to take your analysis to the next level.
