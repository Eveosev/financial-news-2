Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  fell to the lowest level in more than six months after
President  Xi Jinping  signaled that  China  may tolerate slower
economic expansion.  Rebar for delivery in October fell as much as 1.8 percent
to 3,506 yuan ($572) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange today, the lowest since Dec. 3, before trading at 3,517
yuan at 10:34 a.m.  The country won’t sacrifice the environment to ensure
short-term growth, Xi said on May 24 during a study session of
the Communist Party’s top leadership. A survey last week showed
manufacturing is contracting this month for the first time since
October.  “The market is interpreting the comments to mean that the
Chinese new leadership won’t resort to the kind of growth-boosting stimulus we saw in 2009,” Cai Yuehui, analyst at Ruida
Futures Co., said by phone from Fujian today. “Supply is bound
to outpace the demand if the government doesn’t boost it to
absorb all the surplus steel churned out by mills.”  Crude steel output  jumped to a record 709 million tons in
2012, up 25 percent from the level seen in 2009, according to
the National Bureau of Statistics.  Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to Tianjin port
was unchanged at $123.20 a dry ton on May 23, according to The
Steel Index Ltd. data. The average  spot price  for rebar fell 0.3
percent to 3,536  yuan  a ton on May 24, the lowest since Dec. 3,
according to data from Beijing Antaike Information Development
Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
