  Aer Lingus Group Plc (AERL)  climbed the
most in more than two months in Dublin trading after proposals
to fix a pension hole were less onerous that analysts feared and
a report that  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  will be forced to sell half
its stake in the company.  Aer Lingus rose as much as 7.7 percent in intraday trading,
the biggest intraday gain since March 15, and traded at 1.63
euros as of 10:20 a.m. in Dublin. The company said on May 24 it
will consider a Labour Court recommendation that it inject 110
million euros ($142 million) into an industry pension fund.  “The recommendation is well within our 200 million euross
worst-case scenario forecast,” said Donal O’Neill, an analyst
at  Goodbody Stockbrokers  in Dublin, with a buy rating on the
stock. “Notwithstanding that an agreement will also need to be
reached with pilots under a separate scheme, we believe the
resolution of this issue will remove a major risk for the
company and investors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
