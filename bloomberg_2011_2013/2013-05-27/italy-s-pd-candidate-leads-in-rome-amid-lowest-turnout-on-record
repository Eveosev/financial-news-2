Democratic Party candidate Ignazio
Marino won the most votes in the Rome mayoral race in the
broadest test for  Italy ’s political parties since inconclusive
general elections in February, projections indicated.  Marino, an ally of Prime Minister Enrico Letta, won 41.2
percent of vote, about 10 percentage points more than incumbent
mayor Gianni Alemanno, who is backed by former Prime Minister
 Silvio Berlusconi ’s People of Liberty party, according to
projections for state-run television network RAI and based on
about 30 percent of the  vote .  The mayoral vote was part of local elections across the
country with 7 million Italians eligible for the polls in more
than 500 cities and towns. The election came a month after Letta
formed a coalition government with Berlusconi to end three
months of political gridlock caused by the February vote.  About 53 percent of Romans cast ballots, compared with
almost 75 percent in 2008. National turnout was 62.4 percent,
down from more than 77 percent previously.  The votes marked new setbacks for candidates of the
insurgent Five Star Movement, led by comic-turned-politician
Beppe Grillo. Five Star won more than 25 percent of the vote in
February to become the country’s second-biggest political party
on the national level. In the city of Rome support for Five Star
reached 27.7 percent in February.  The Five Star’s mayoral candidate in the Italian capital
came in third with about 11 percent, according to the RAI
projections.  If the projections are confirmed and Marino falls short of
the 50 percent required for outright victory, he will face
Alemanno in a run-off election on June 8-9.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
