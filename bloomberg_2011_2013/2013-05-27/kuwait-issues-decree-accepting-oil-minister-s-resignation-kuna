Kuwait’s cabinet issued two decrees
accepting the resignation of Hani Hussein as oil minister and
appointing Finance Minister Mustafa Al-Shimali as acting oil
minister, state-run KUNA reported today.  The state news agency cited the state minister for cabinet
affairs, Sheikh Mohammed Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah, for the
information.  Al-Qabas newspaper earlier today reported Al-Shimali’s
appointment, a day after another newspaper, Al-Watan, said
Hussein’s resignation had been accepted. Hussein was first
appointed oil minister in February 2012.  Lawmakers were scheduled to question Hussein tomorrow over
a failed deal with Dow Chemical Co. and $2.19 billion in
compensation paid by Kuwait as a result. Hussein was given the
choice to either proceed with the questioning or resign,
according to Al-Qabas.  Legislators had also asked to quiz Hussein on the alleged
sale of liquor at Kuwaiti-owned fuel stations in  Europe ,
repeated breaches of a boycott of  Israel  and irregular
promotions of oil industry staff.  To contact the reporter on this story:
