Ibovespa futures  fell as economists
covering Brazil cut estimates for manufacturing growth for a
second week, adding to concern the recovery in Latin America’s
largest economy will falter.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the state-controlled  oil company ,
might move after saying it rejected all bids for its Argentine
assets.  CCX Carvao da Colombia SA  may be active after postponing
the date for a tender in which controlling shareholder  Eike
Batista  plans to buy all outstanding shares of the coal producer
to July 17 from June 4.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in June declined 0.2
percent to 56,420 at 9:10 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real was
unchanged at 2.0515 per dollar, after depreciating for four
consecutive weeks. Markets in the U.S. are closed for Capital
Memorial Day holiday today.  Brazil’s industrial output will expand 2.43 percent this
year and 3.10 percent in the next, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by the central bank. They had
forecast growth of 2.50 percent and 3.50 percent, respectively,
a week earlier.  The Ibovespa has declined 7.5 percent this year,
underperforming  emerging markets  including China, Russia and
 India , amid concern quickening inflation will curb the nation’s
economic recovery. Brazil’s main equity index  trades  at 12.9
times analyst earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with a multiple of 10.8 for the MSCI Emerging Markets
Index of 21 developing nations’ equities, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Trading volume for stocks in  Sao Paulo  was 7.43 billion
reais ($3.62 billion) on May 24, compared with a daily average
of 7.73 billion reais this year through May 23, according to
data compiled by the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
