Jet Airways (India) Ltd. (JETIN)  plans to
order more aircraft as it prepares to fend off competition from
Asia’s biggest budget carrier, which seeks to start operations
in the country this year.  Jet is considering an order for  Boeing (BA)  Co. 737 planes, K.G. Vishwanath, the Mumbai-based carrier’s vice president of
commercial strategy, told analysts in a conference call
yesterday. He didn’t disclose the number of aircraft or a time
frame.  The airline, which has agreed to sell a stake to  Etihad
Airways  PJSC, will boost domestic  seat capacity  by as much as 8
percent a year as it takes delivery of 46 aircraft, ordered with
Boeing earlier, over three years, Vishwanath said. The number of
airline passengers in the country may triple to 180 million by
2021, the government has forecast, as more people fly instead of
taking trains.  “They definitely need more aircraft,” said Harsh Vardhan,
chairman of New Delhi-based  Starair Consulting . “Jet has to
fight for market share. With Etihad on board, they’ve the
resource to do that.”  Jet rose 0.9 percent to 552.30 rupees at close of trading
in Mumbai. The stock has lost 1.3 percent since the start of the
year, compared with a 3.8 percent gain for the benchmark S&P BSE
Sensex.  Passengers Double  Carriers in India will need 1,450 new planes worth $175
billion over the next 20 years, Boeing forecast in February. The
 International Air Transport Association  has said India may be
the world’s fastest-growing aviation market after  Kazakhstan  by
2016.  Over the past seven years, airline passenger traffic in
India more than doubled to about 60 million annually. In
comparison, Indian railways carry 23 million travelers every day
on Asia’s oldest network.  AirAsia (AIRA)  Bhd. has partnered with  Tata Group  for its India
venture, which may start operations later this year.  Tony Fernandes , AirAsia group chief executive, has expanded the
Malaysian carrier into the region’s biggest discount operator by
setting up ventures in the  Philippines , Japan, Thailand and
Indonesia.  In December, AirAsia ordered 100 Airbus SAS A320s valued at
$9.4 billion, in addition to the 200 it had agreed in 2011 to
purchase. IndiGo, the discount carrier that last year overtook
Jet to become India’s biggest in terms of domestic market share,
ordered 180 A320s in January 2011.  Boeing, Airbus  Jet, the nation’s biggest listed carrier, may buy 50 737
MAX and about 10 777-300ER from Boeing and order 50 Airbus
A320neos at the Paris Air Show, the CAPA Centre for Aviation, a
Sydney-based consulting company, said this month. Vishwanath
yesterday said the carrier has no plans to order the A320neos.
The  Paris Air Show  begins June 17.  Jet, which started operations in 1993, has a fleet of 100
aircraft, according to the company’s website. IndiGo, which
began flying in 2006, has 65 aircraft.  Chairman Naresh Goyal last month agreed to sell a 24
percent stake to  Abu Dhabi ’s Etihad Airways for 20.6 billion
rupees ($370 million) after the Indian government eased aviation
investment rules. Jet plans to repay $350 million of debt,
including aircraft loans, to pare costs, Vishwanath said
yesterday.  The carrier last week posted a wider-than-estimated fourth-quarter  loss  of 4.96 billion rupees as aircraft lease costs
increased and the airline had a one-time expense. Jet hasn’t
posted an annual profit in the six years through March. As a
standalone business, it reported a profit of 96.9 million rupees
in the 12 months ended March 2011.  Jet will focus on increasing services to Abu Dhabi by
adding more direct flights to the emirate from smaller Indian
cities, Vishwanath said. The carrier will also look at expanding
services to Europe with new direct flights.  Starting 2015, Jet will take deliveries of 10 on-order
Boeing 787s to expand international operations, according to
Vishwanath. The airline will also look at leasing out six Airbus
A330-200 jets to Etihad, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
