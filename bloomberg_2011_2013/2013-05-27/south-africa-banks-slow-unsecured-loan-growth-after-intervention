South Africa ’s banks have slowed
growth in unsecured lending since a November warning, according
to the central bank.  Such loans, which aren’t backed by assets, increased by
about 25 percent annually in March, down from 30 percent in
November, Hendrik Nel, in charge of the financial stability unit
at the central bank, said at an event in Johannesburg today. The
bank’s supervision department met with the nation’s lenders last
year, Rene van Wyk, registrar of banks, said.  “There’s been a dramatic slowdown in unsecured lending,”
Van Wyk said. “We’re satisfied that our intervention worked.”  African Bank Investments Ltd. (ABL) , the nation’s largest
provider of unsecured loans, cut its dividend 71 percent on May
20 as net income decreased 26 percent. South African consumers
are struggling to repay debt with a 25 percent unemployment
rate, increasing fuel and electricity costs and an economy that
will grow 2.4 percent this year, the slowest since the 2009
recession according to central bank estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
