There is a new player emerging on the cultural and business scene today: the idea entrepreneur. Perhaps you are one yourself — or would like to be. The idea entrepreneur is an individual, usually a content expert and often a maverick, whose main goal is to influence how other people think and behave in relation to their cherished topic. These people don't seek power over others and they're not motivated by the prospect of achieving great wealth. Their goal is to make a difference, to change the world in some way. Idea entrepreneurs are popping up everywhere. They're people like  Sheryl Sandberg  (Facebook COO and author of  Lean In ), who is advocating a big new idea from within an organization. And like  Atul Gawande  (the checklist doctor), who is working to transform a professional discipline. Or like  Blake Mycoskie  (founder of TOMS shoes), who has created an unconventional business model. In my research into this phenomenon (which forms the basis of my book,  Breaking Out ), I have been amazed at how many different kinds of people aspire to be idea entrepreneurs. I have met with, interviewed, emailed or tweeted with librarians, salespeople, educators, thirteen-year-old kids, marketers, technologists, consultants, business leaders, social entrepreneurs — from countries all over the world — who have an idea, want to go public with it, and, in some cases, build a sustainable enterprise around it. The ones who succeed — whether it's disrupting an established way of doing business as  Vineet Nayar  has done with his company or bringing a mindset change to a small community like  Maria Madison  has done in Concord, Massachusetts — share the following methods: People who have shaped our thinking and our society over the decades, even centuries, and continue to do so today — from  Benjamin Franklin  to  Mohandas Gandhi t o  Hannah Salwen , an American teenager who modeled a disruptive approach to philanthropy — have followed the path of the idea entrepreneur.  These days, the model is well-defined and, thanks to the amazing range of activities we have for creating and sharing ideas, is within reach for just about anyone. If you have an idea, and want to go public with it, idea entrepreneurship can be one of the most powerful forces for change and improvement in the world today.
