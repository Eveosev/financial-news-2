Canadian Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty  says he wishes “bad luck” to short sellers seeking to
profit from declines in the nation’s housing prices.  Flaherty, speaking to reporters in Waterloo, Ontario, said
the government has taken measures to tighten mortgage lending
rules, helping to moderate price increases. Other countries that
have experienced sharp declines in housing prices hadn’t taken
such measures, Flaherty said.  Short sellers profit from price declines by selling
borrowed securities and repurchasing them at cheaper levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
