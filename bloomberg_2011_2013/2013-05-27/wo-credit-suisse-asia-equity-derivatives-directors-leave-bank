Two directors in  Credit Suisse Group
AG (CSGN) ’s Hong Kong equity-derivatives business left the bank.  Martin Boldt-Christmas, a director for equity-derivatives
sales, left Credit Suisse after working for about 10 years at
the bank, spokeswoman Noel Cheung said in an e-mailed response
to questions. Marty Sun, who joined the firm in 2011, quit as a
Delta One trader, the Hong Kong-based spokeswoman said,
declining to comment on the reason for the departures.  Boldt-Christmas declined to comment when contacted by
mobile phone today. Sun wasn’t immediately reachable by mobile
phone and didn’t respond to a text message seeking comment. The
pair’s exit from  Switzerland ’s second-biggest bank follows the
April departure of Min Park, who oversaw equity derivatives and
convertible sales for the Asia-Pacific region.  Equity-derivative products include options, equity index
swaps and convertible bonds and are also used to create
structured notes. Delta One traders typically help clients
speculate on or hedge the performance of a group of securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
