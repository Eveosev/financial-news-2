Famous Brands Ltd. (FBR) , a South African
fast-food chain owner, plans to open 55 outlets this year in
African countries where it already operates as sales growth
elsewhere on the continent beats the local market.  “Our brands are gaining traction in  Africa ,” Chief
Executive Officer Kevin Hedderwick said in a telephone interview
today. “There is significant promise” in the 15 African
nations outside its home country where Famous Brands has
restaurants including Steers burgers and Debonairs Pizza.  Sales on a like-for-like basis in the year to Feb. 28
jumped 28 percent in those markets, which now account for 7.3
percent of revenue, the Johannesburg-based company said in a
statement today. Growth in Zambia, Mauritius and  Nigeria  is
“gaining traction,” Hedderwick said. Sales in  South Africa 
rose 7.7 percent.  Full-year net income advanced 23 percent to 328.8 million
rand ($34.2 million), the company said. Revenue increased 17
percent to 2.5 billion rand. The restaurant owner plans to boost
the full-year dividend 25 percent to 2.50 rand a share.  Outside of Africa, Famous Brands will open its first Steers
outlet in the U.K. and its first Debonairs Pizza restaurant in
 India  in July, the company said.  Famous Brands  fell  for the time in five days, declining 0.8
percent to 93.23 rand at the close in Johannesburg, trimming its
rally over the past year to 76 percent.  Having bought Europa and Fego Caffe brands in the past
year, the company has also entered rural South African markets
in which it was “previously under-represented,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
