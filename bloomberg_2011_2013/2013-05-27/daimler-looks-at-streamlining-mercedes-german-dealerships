Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz division,
the world’s third-biggest maker of  luxury vehicles , is looking
at streamlining its German dealership network because a rebound
in the European auto market is unlikely soon.  Daimler wants its own sales outlets to meet profitability
levels of independently owned Mercedes dealers, Bettina Singhartinger, a spokeswoman for the Stuttgart, Germany-based
carmaker, said today in an e-mail.  Four-month sales in Europe by Mercedes rose 4.2 percent
from a year earlier, counter to a 7 percent industrywide decline
amid a sixth consecutive annual drop in the market. German trade
magazine Automobilwoche reported earlier today that Daimler may
revamp its German dealer network, including a possible sale,
closing or merger of some outlets.  “Our sales structures are being examined continuously to
create efficiency and position ourselves according to changing
market developments,” Singhartinger said. “Daimler pursues a
strategy of its own profitable sales organization within a
strong, independent dealership network.”  Daimler directly controls 34 Mercedes distributors in
 Germany  with 144 outlets, out of a total of almost 1,400 dealers
for the brand in the country, Singhartinger said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
