Swiss stocks  were little changed
after the benchmark Swiss Market Index posted its first weekly
drop in more than a month.  The SMI (SMI)  declined 0.1 percent to 8,161.14 at 10:05 a.m. in
Zurich. The gauge fell 1.4 percent last week, its first retreat
in five weeks. The broader Swiss Performance Index also
decreased 0.1 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 32 percent lower than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Markets in the U.K. and
the U.S. are closed today for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
