The mayor of  Rio de Janeiro , Eduardo Paes, apologized today after a physical altercation with a
musician in a restaurant.  Paes was dining at a restaurant located in the leafy Jardim
Botanico neighborhood this weekend when Bernardo Botkay, an
author and musician known as Botika, began hurling insults
including “turd” and “bum” at him.  Botkay alleges that Paes approached him and punched him in
the face, according to his Facebook page. Paes said the insults
resulted in an argument and an ensuing “physical
misunderstanding” that prompted his security detail to
intervene, according to a statement.  “Personal attacks during private moments with my wife are
not acceptable,” Paes said. “Despite the couple’s attacks, I
should not have reacted as I did. I ask for forgiveness from the
population of my city for the way I acted.”  Rio de Janeiro,  Brazil ’s second-largest city, will host the
finals of the 2014  World Cup  as well as the 2016 summer Olympic
games. Brazil’s former capital has labored to recast itself as a
modern hub ripe for investment and tourism, after increased
policing and economic growth reduced the violence that
characterized Rio for decades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
