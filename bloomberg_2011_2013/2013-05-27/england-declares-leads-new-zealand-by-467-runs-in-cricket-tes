England needs four wickets on the
last day to sweep its cricket Test with  New Zealand  after
restricting the visitors to 158-6 today.  Tim Southee, on 4, and Brendon McCullum, with no runs, were
batting at stumps today on the fourth day of the second Test.
Graeme Swann, who took 4-42, and  Steven Finn , who took 3-36,
lead the attack.  England set New Zealand a victory target of 468 after
declaring on 287-5 in its second innings. Captain Alastair Cook
led England with 130 runs before he was caught off the bowling
of Kane Williamson, who took 3-68 in the second innings at
Headingley in Leeds. England declared after 76 overs, with Jonny
Bairstow on 26 and Matt Prior on 4.  Rain wiped out play on the opening day of the match.
England leads the two-match series 1-0 following its 170-run win
at Lordâ€™s in London.  The weather forecast for tomorrow is for a cloudy day, with
light rain in the afternoon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
