Hidili Industry International
Development Ltd. (1393) , a Chinese coking coal producer, is poised for
its biggest gain in six weeks after announcing it plans to sell
assets to help repay short-term debt.  Shares rose 4.1 percent, the most since April 10, to
HK$1.78 as of 12:23 p.m. in  Hong Kong  trading after climbing as
much as 7.6 percent. Hidili agreed to sell a 50 percent stake in
its coal mines, washing plants and other facilities in Yunnan
and Guizhou provinces for 2.4 billion  yuan  ($392 million) to a
unit of state-owned Yunnan Coal Chemical Industry Group Co., the
company said in an exchange filing today.  The shares had been suspended since May 20 pending an
announcement. The proceeds will be used to help repay short-term
borrowings, according to the statement.  “This move helps mitigate short-term liquidity issues,”
 Helen Lau , a Hong Kong-based analyst with UOB Kay Hian Ltd.,
said today in an e-mailed note. “But revenue and earnings will
also be reduced by approximately 15 percent accordingly on an
annual basis.”  Hidili swung to a 147 million yuan  net loss  in 2012 from a
profit a year ago because of lower coal prices and production
volume.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
