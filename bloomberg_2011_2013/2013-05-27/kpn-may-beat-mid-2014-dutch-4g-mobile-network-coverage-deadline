Royal KPN NV (KPN) , the Dutch phone
operator partly owned by  Carlos Slim ’s  America Movil SAB (AMXL) , may
complete its domestic 4G, or fourth generation, high-speed
wireless network sooner than its original target.  “We are on schedule and getting to 50 percent coverage and
if we can get to 100 percent before the summer next year, I
won’t hesitate to do it,” Joost Farwerck, managing director of
KPN Netherlands, told Bloomberg at an event in Rotterdam today.
“It makes sense to keep up the pace as there’s demand, and
customers are really excited about 4G.”  To stay ahead of the competition, The Hague-based KPN began
its Dutch rollout in the first quarter after paying 1.35 billion
euros ($1.7 billion) in December to buy frequencies to serve
consumers seeking faster mobile networks as they use smartphones
to surf the Web, download music and watch videos.  KPN raised about 3 billion euros through a share sale to
invest in operations and reduce debt. The company has scrapped
dividends planned for 2013 and 2014 and originally said it would
complete its Dutch 4G network by the summer of 2014.  “We paid much more than we had hoped for, but given this
is for 17 years and the billions of euros that are involved in
this business, I think investors understand that,” Farwerck
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
