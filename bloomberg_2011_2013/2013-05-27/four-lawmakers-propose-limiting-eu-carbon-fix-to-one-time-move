Four members of the European
Parliament are seeking a one-time delay to carbon-permit sales
to tackle a record glut, limiting a proposal by the region’s
regulator, according to a document obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Bas Eickhout of the Greens group in the assembly, Linda
McAvan of the Socialists and Democrats group, Corinne Lepage of
Alliance of Liberals and Democrats, and Sabine Wils from the
European United Left-Nordic Green Left proposed a total of 9
amendments to the stopgap carbon fix designed by the European
Union’s regulatory arm, according to the document.  The changes will be voted on by the Parliament’s
environment committee in June.  The lawmakers proposed the European Commission may “in
exceptional circumstances” adapt the auctioning timetable to
ensure an orderly functioning of the market. The wording they
are seeking is in line with a modification of the draft measure
sought by Ireland, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency in
the first half of this year, according to the document.  The environment committee is scheduled to vote on the
emergency plan to prop up carbon prices on June 19 after the
whole Parliament declined to support it last month, referring it
to the panel for further talks. The next plenary vote is planned
on July 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
