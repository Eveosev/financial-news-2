South African wheat futures gained to
the highest level in more than three months as the rand weakened
against the dollar, making imports more expensive and increasing
demand for locally produced cereal.  Wheat for delivery in July, the most active contract, rose
for a fifth day, adding 0.2 percent to 3,575 rand ($372) a
metric ton, the highest since Feb. 11, by the midday close on
the South African Futures Exchange.  The rand traded at 9.5941 per dollar by noon. That’s within
10 cents of 9.6948 reached on May 23, the weakest level since
March 30, 2009.  “This is as a result of the weaker rand,” Lindy van Blommestein, a trader at Johannesburg-based Farmwise Grains
(Pty) Ltd., said by phone. “Wheat prices will move up as the
rand is very volatile.”  South Africa  is sub-Saharan  Africa ’s largest producer of
the grain after  Ethiopia  and the region’s biggest importer after
Nigeria and  Sudan , according to U.S. Department of Agriculture
data.  The nation produced 1.87 million tons in 2012, 7 percent
less than a year earlier, the Crop Estimates Committee said on
May 7.  White corn for delivery in the same month rose 0.2 percent
to 2,201 rand a ton, while the yellow variety gained 0.4 percent
to 2,176 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
