Japanese  stocks  fell, with the Topix
Index extending the biggest weekly drop since August 2011, as
the yen rose a third day after  Bank of Japan  Governor Haruhiko
Kuroda said the country could withstand higher  interest rates .  All but 15 companies fell on the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) ,
with Toyota Motor Corp., Sony Corp. and Panasonic Corp. losing
more than 4 percent. Softbank Corp. dropped 4.1 percent after
U.S. Senator  Charles Schumer  said the carrier’s $20.1 billion
bid for Sprint Nextel Corp. raises national security concerns.
Nipro Corp. surged 19 percent after an initial public offering
was announced for ReproCell Inc., a biotech company part-owned
by the maker of medical products.  The Topix lost 3.4 percent to close at 1,154.07 in  Tokyo ,
with 32 of 33 industry groups falling. The gauge, which plunged
6.9 percent on May 23, the most since the aftermath of the March
2011 disaster, is trading within half a percentage point from a
correction, defined as a 10 percent drop from a recent high.  “The market is way ahead of fundamentals,” said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-based head of dynamic  asset allocation  at AMP
Capital Investors Ltd., which manages $126 billion. “The market
is going to be drifting lower -- from its high to its bottom,
it’ll be a 20 percent fall over a few weeks. We may add on our
positions then.”  The Nikkei 225 dropped 3.2 percent to 14,142.65 today on
volume 15 percent above the 100-day average. The gauge’s
volatility index, which cooled a second day from a two-year
high, showed traders expect a swing of 11 percent for the
benchmark in the next 30 days.  Shares Retreat  More than 750 of the 3,730 stocks listed in  Japan  have
declined more than 25 percent from their one-year highs,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The  Topix (TPX)  is still up
about 34 percent this year, more than double the advance for the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) , amid unprecedented monetary easing
from the BOJ.  Carmakers and electronic companies exerted the biggest  drag 
among Topix industry groups today. The yen rose as much as 0.5
percent to 100.79 per dollar after jumping 1.9 percent last
week, the most since the five days ended June 1, 2012.  Toyota, the world’s biggest carmaker, lost 5 percent to
5,920 yen today, while Sony dropped 6.3 percent to 2,013 yen.
Panasonic, which gets nearly half its sales from outside Japan,
tumbled 7.1 percent to 831 yen.  SoftBank sank 4.1 percent to 5,170 yen.  New York  Senator
Schumer wrote to the Treasury Department that SoftBank’s
purchase of Sprint could open “a backdoor for hackers”
targeting the U.S. because of a possible reliance on Chinese
networking equipment.  China Growth  Shares also fell after  China ’s President  Xi Jinping 
signaled a tolerance for slower expansion to avoid environmental
degradation. A separate report showed gains in Chinese
industrial companies’ profits quickened in April as sales
increased.  There’s “no sign at this point of excessively bullish
expectations in asset markets or in the activities of financial
institutions,” BOJ Governor Kuroda said yesterday in Tokyo.  The central banker also cited an April report indicating an
increase of between one to three percentage points in interest
rates would be manageable, as improving lending margins and
rising stocks offset some negative effects.  “The BOJ dominates asset markets for better or worse,”
 Bill Gross , co-chief investment officer at Pacific Investment
Management Co., said yesterday in a post on Twitter. “Watch
JGBs, the Yen and the exodus from each.”  Among stocks that gained, Nipro surged 19 percent to 1,330
yen, the most on the Topix. ReproCell, which is developing stem-cell drugs, said it would list on Osaka’s Jasdaq exchange for
start-ups in June. Nipro is ReproCell’s second-biggest
shareholder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
