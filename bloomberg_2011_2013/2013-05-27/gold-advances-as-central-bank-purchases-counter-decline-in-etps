Gold rose, extending gains after the
best week in a month, as buying by central banks and signs of
increased physical demand countered continued outflows in
investor holdings. Silver, platinum and palladium advanced.  Spot gold gained as much as 0.6 percent to $1,395.38 an
ounce before trading at $1,394.15 by 6:18 p.m. in Singapore.
Prices advanced 2 percent last week, the best showing since the
five days to April 26, on speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve
will maintain asset purchases and as  China  manufacturing slowed.  Russia and Kazakhstan expanded  gold reserves  for the
seventh straight month in April, when prices tumbled into a  bear
market , International Monetary Fund data show. The volume for
the Shanghai Gold Exchange’s benchmark cash contract jumped to a
three-week high on May 24, while assets in gold-backed exchange-traded products dropped for a 15th week last week.  “We expect the trend of central bank buying to continue,
especially in the emerging economies,” said Alexandra Knight,
an economist at National Australia Bank Ltd. in  Melbourne .
“While expectations are for lower prices at the end of the
year, physical demand, especially in  Asia , has been very
supportive.”  Gold is 17 percent lower this year as some investors lost
faith in the metal as a store of value, reduced holdings in ETPs
and shifted into riskier assets including equities. Asian stocks
dropped for a fifth day today as China’s President  Xi Jinping 
signaled a tolerance for slower economic growth. Markets in the
U.S. and U.K. are shut today.  Gold Longs  Bullion for August delivery gained 0.5 percent to $1,393.70
an ounce on the Comex in  New York . Money managers cut their net-long position by 9 percent to 35,686 futures and options in the
week to May 21, the lowest since July 2007, U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data show.  IMF data showed Turkey, Belarus, Azerbaijan and Greece
joined Russia and Kazakhstan in adding gold to reserves last
month. Mexico and Canada reduced holdings, the data showed. In
China, the volume for cash bullion of 99.99 percent purity rose
to 22,455 kilograms on May 24 from 12,521 kilograms on May 23,
according to data on the Shanghai Gold Exchange’s website.  Cash silver climbed 1.3 percent to $22.695 an ounce,
platinum rose 0.5 percent to $1,459.15 an ounce, and palladium
gained 0.7 percent to $732.25 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
