The European Union may consider
giving  Portugal  more time to meet its deficit targets if
economic conditions worsen, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the
group of euro-area finance ministers, said.  “If, on the basis of the effort of complying to the
programs and reaching structural targets, more time is necessary
because of the economic setback, then more time might be
considered at that time,” Dijsselbloem said in Lisbon today.
“Now it’s time to continue with the program and meet the
structural targets agreed.”  The Portuguese government announced less ambitious targets
on March 15 for narrowing its deficit as it predicted the
economy will shrink twice as much as previously estimated this
year. It projects a budget shortfall equivalent to 5.5 percent
of gross domestic product in 2013 and 4 percent in 2014, while
forecasting economic contraction of 2.3 percent and growth of
0.6 percent, respectively.  Dijsselbloem said the government hasn’t yet requested
another change of timetables and targets.  “The  Portuguese government  is fully committed to work on
that basis with the European partners and the European partners
are fully committed to support Portugal where and when
necessary,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
