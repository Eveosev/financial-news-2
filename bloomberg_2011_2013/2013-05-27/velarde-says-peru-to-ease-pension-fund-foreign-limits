Peru ’s central bank President Julio Velarde said limits on local pension funds’ foreign holdings
will continue to be eased gradually.  The central bank lifted the ceiling on pension fund foreign
portfolios for the third time in four months on April 7, taking
the limit to 36 percent from 30 percent in December last year.  “Our position is to keep increasing that over time, we
don’t have a precise date,” Velarde told reporters today in
Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
