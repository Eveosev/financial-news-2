Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science and
Technology Co. ,  China ’s second-largest construction equipment
maker, halted  stock trading  and saw its bonds decline after a 
report on Sina.com accused it of falsifying sales.  The Shenzhen-listed  shares  were halted because of the
report and trading will resume after the company posts a filing 
on the issue, Changsha-based Zoomlion said in a statement. The 
Hong Kong-traded  stock  was also suspended.  Zoomlion’s $600 million of 6.125 percent bonds due December
2022 slumped 2.1 cents on the dollar to 95.4 cents as of 11:21
a.m. in  Hong Kong , the lowest level since March 6 and heading
for the biggest daily decline since Feb. 4, Bloomberg prices
show.  Zoomlion's Hong Kong-traded stock has  slumped  31 percent 
this year as its first-quarter profit plummeted 72 percent.
Construction-equipment makers, including bigger rival  Sany Heavy
Industry Co. (600031) , face a drop in orders as slowing economic growth
and government curbs on the property market sap demand.  Hong Xiaoming, a Zoomlion vice president in charge of the
finance department, said in a mobile-phone text message that the
company will issue a clarification today. She didn’t elaborate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
