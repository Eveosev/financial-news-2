Most Slovenians expect the European
Commission to affirm the country is on the right track to
recovery with its overhaul program, a survey showed.  A  Delo  poll showed 48 percent think the European Union’s
executive arm will support the program presented on May 9 by the
government of Prime Minister Alenka Bratusek. Forty-four percent
said they expect a negative assessment, according to the poll
published today in the Ljubljana-based newspaper. The survey
queried 402 people on May 22-23. No margin of error was given.  Slovenia, mired in a banking crisis and recession, is
pushing a bank recapitalization plan of 900 million euros ($1.2
billion) that will clean up its lenders’ balance sheets along
with a proposal to create a bad bank that’s meant to ease the
credit crunch and aid an economic recovery. The Adriatic nation
will also sell some state assets to offset a widening budget
deficit.  The European Commission will release its assessment of the
Slovenian program on May 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
