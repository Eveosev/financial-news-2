Japanese and Australian  stock futures 
fell, indicating the Asia-Pacific equities benchmark index will
extend its longest losing streak in more than six months, as
investors await a speech by a Bank of Japan policy maker.  American Depositary Receipts of  National Australia Bank (NAB) ,
the country’s largest lender by assets, lost 0.8 percent from
the close of trading in Sydney. ADRs of Honda Motor Co. gained
2.6 percent as the yen weakened, indicating shares of the
carmaker will rebound from the lowest level in nearly a month.  Futures on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average traded at 13,925 in
Chicago, down from 14,030 at the close in Osaka, Japan. They
were bid in the premarket at 13,930 at 8:05 a.m. in Tokyo.
Futures on  Australia ’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  lost 0.3 percent and
New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 0.3 percent.  “Markets are starting to price in a lessening of the
monthly purchases of the  Federal Reserve ’s unprecedented policy
stimulus,” said Matthew Sherwood, Sydney-based head of
investment market research at Perpetual Ltd., which manages
about $25 billion. “This process is now a question of when, not
if.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell the past five days, its
longest losing streak since November, as speculation grew the
Fed will reduce its bond purchases as the  U.S. economy  improves
and China manufacturing data missed estimates.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures rose 0.1 percent.
Markets in the U.S. reopen today after a holiday.  Hong Kong  Futures on the  Hang Seng Index  gained 0.3 percent and
futures on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index were little
changed.  A gain of 5.8 percent in 2013 through yesterday on the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index left the measure trading at 13.4 times
 estimated earnings , compared with a multiple of 15 on the S&P
500 and 13.4 on the Stoxx 600, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Japan’s Topix Index yesterday slid 3.4 percent, extending
the worst weekly decline in more than a year. The measure has
lost 9.6 percent from May 22, when it closed at the highest
level since August 2008. The exporter-heavy Nikkei 225 Stock
Average fell 3.2 percent yesterday.  The two gauges have risen more than 30 percent this year to
outperform all major equity indexes amid unprecedented monetary
easing policies from the  Bank of Japan . The  S&P 500 Index  is up
16 percent and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 8.8 percent this
year.  Bank of Japan board member Ryuzo Miyao is due to speak in
Tokyo today.  The yen fell 0.2 percent to 101.12 as of 8:06 a.m. in
Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
