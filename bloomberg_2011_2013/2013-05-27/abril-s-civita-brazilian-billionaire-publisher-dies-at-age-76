Billionaire Roberto Civita, an
Italian-born publisher who created  Brazil ’s biggest weekly news
magazine, has died. He was 76.  Grupo Abril’s chairman died yesterday at the Sirio-Libanes
hospital in Sao Paulo after three months battling an abdominal
aneurysm, according to his company’s website. He is survived  by
his wife Maria Antonieta and three children.  After an 18-month internship at Time Inc., Civita returned
to Brazil in 1958 and told his father Victor, the founder of
Grupo Abril, he wished to publish a weekly similar to Time, a
business journal along the lines of Fortune and a magazine like
Playboy.  In 1968, Civita created Veja magazine, the most read
general news weekly in Latin America’s biggest economy. Abril
publishes seven of the 10 most-read magazines in Brazil,
including Exame and the local version of Playboy, according
Abril’s website.  “I like being an editor,” Civita used to say, according
to the website. “And I know how to make a magazine.”  Civita, who had a net worth of $4.9 billion, according to
Forbes World’s Billionaires list, took over the group when his
father died in 1990. He expanded the business into education,
founding  Abril Educacao SA (ABRE11) , which was taken public in 2011.  He was born in Milan and was a naturalized Brazilian.  To contact the reporter on this story:
