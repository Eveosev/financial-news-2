The United Arab Emirates sees current
crude prices as “suitable and fair” and not hurting consumers,
the nation’s energy minister said as OPEC prepares to review the
group’s target for oil production.  Global demand for crude is expected to stay “relatively
weak this year” at around 800,000 barrels a day more than in
2012, Suhail Mohammed Al Mazrouei told the U.A.E.’s official WAM
news agency today.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries , set to
meet on May 31, is ensuring that supply is sufficient to meet
demand, said Al Mazrouei, who in March took charge of the
ministry previously headed by Mohamed Bin Dhaen Al-Hamli. OPEC
is now producing 30.4 million barrels a day, “only little above
the organization’s target, and this reflects the demand on its
crude,” he said.  Benchmark Brent crude futures were at $102.38 a barrel on
the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange today at 1:32 p.m.
local time. U.S. West Texas Intermediate contracts for July were
at $93.50 in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange.  The U.A.E. was OPEC’s fifth-largest producer in April,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 12-member group
supplies 40 percent of the world’s oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
