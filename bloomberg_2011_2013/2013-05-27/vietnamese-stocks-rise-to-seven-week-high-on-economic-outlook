Vietnam ’s  stocks  rose, driving the
benchmark index to a seven-week high, after the government said
the economy improved and foreign direct investment increased.  The  Ho Chi Minh City  Stock Exchange’s  VN Index (VNINDEX)  advanced 1.7
percent to 508.69 as of 10:49 a.m. local time, poised for the
highest close since April 9. Vietnam Dairy Products Joint-Stock
Co., the second-biggest publicly traded company by market value,
surged 2.3 percent to a record. Bao Viet Holdings, an insurance
company, climbed 1 percent.  The nation’s macroeconomic situation is improving as
companies’ inventories decline and direct foreign investment
increases, Vu Duc Dam, chairman of the government office, said
at a briefing in Hanoi yesterday. The VN Index has climbed 8.6
percent from a six-week low on April 22 as the central bank cut
interest rates and as the government took steps to resolve
banks’ bad loans.  “Most of the news out recently is very positive for the
market,” Pham Ngoc Bich, managing director of institutional
sales at Saigon Securities Inc., said by phone today from Ho Chi
Minh City. “Investor optimism” is continuing after Dam’s
comments, he said.  Vietnam’s Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung approved the
formation of an asset-management company to acquire non-performing loans from the nation’s lenders, the central bank
said on May 21. The  State Bank  of Vietnam cut  interest rates  on
May 13, the eighth reduction since the start of 2012.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
