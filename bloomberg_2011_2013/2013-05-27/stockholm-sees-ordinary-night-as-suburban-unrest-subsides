Sweden’s capital experienced what
police described as “an ordinary night” as the burning and
rioting that gripped Stockholm’s suburbs last week tapered off.  Fewer than 10 cars were set on fire overnight and there
were no reports of stones being thrown at  emergency services  or
police and no major vandalism, Kjell Lindgren, a spokesman for
the Stockholm police, said by telephone today. Between Saturday
and Sunday, some 20 cars were set on fire and a school and store
in a southern suburb were vandalized, according to police. Rocks
were also thrown at police in the Vaarberg suburb.  “We’ll not lean back and relax and will continue with an
increased presence in the suburbs,” Lindgren said, adding that
community groups and adults have helped calm the situation.
Yesterday was “like a normal night,” he said.  Cars and schools have burned for a week across Stockholm’s
outer suburbs, which are dotted by high-rise blocks built in the
1970s that are predominantly home to immigrant families.  While the shooting by police of a man of Portuguese descent
in the Husby area and alleged police brutality have been cited
by community group Megafonen and Swedish media as the trigger
that started the riots, social exclusion, high unemployment and
low education among youths and immigrants are seen as the deeper
causes of the unrest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
