El Al Israel Airlines Ltd. (ELAL)  declined
for the second time in three days after the carrier reported a
wider first-quarter loss and on concern competition and fuel
prices will weigh on results.  The shares of  Israel ’s flagship airline declined 4 percent
to 0.643 shekel at 2:30 p.m. in  Tel Aviv , trimming the company’s
market value to 319 million shekels ($87 million). The company
signed an agreement in April with Fimi Opportunity Funds for an
investment of as much as $75 million, which helped push the
stock 37 percent higher this year.  Fuel costs in the quarter rose 4.8 percent and its market
share declined to 34.7 percent from 36.6 percent in the year-earlier period, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.
The Israeli cabinet in April approved an accord with the
European Union, designed to increase competition and lower fares
by allowing airlines to fly to more destinations.  “The sector continues to be competitive and investment in
the industry is seen as risky because it’s dependent on macro
factors such as fuel prices,” Eyal Dabby, head of research at
 Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd. (LUMI) , said today by phone.  The loss widened to $32.5 million from $23.3 million in the
year-earlier period. The continued impact of the Pillar of
Defense operation last year, which turned tourists away, and
competition hurt the results, El Al said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
