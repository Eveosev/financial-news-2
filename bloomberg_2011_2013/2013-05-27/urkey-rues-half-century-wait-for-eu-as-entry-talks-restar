Turkey  voiced disappointment with the
dawdling pace of its bid to join the European Union after the EU
moved to restart entry talks following a three-year hiatus.  “With one flower, spring doesn’t come,” Turkish Foreign
Minister  Ahmet Davutoglu  told reporters in Brussels today.
“With this speed, we might have to wait another half century to
complete the process.”  Davutoglu was reacting to an EU pledge to move ahead next
month with a process that had been stalled by objections by
European countries such as France and Cyprus and by Turkey’s own
concentration on the  Middle East .  European interest in Turkey has been revived by concern
about the spillover from Syria’s civil war and by the need to
reanimate the economy of EU member Cyprus, which is part-occupied by Turkish troops.  Since starting down the EU road in October 2005, Turkey has
opened  talks  in 13 of 35 EU policy areas and completed one. The
EU is likely to open another policy area, regional development,
in June, Irish Deputy Prime Minister  Eamon Gilmore  said.  Detecting new momentum in EU-Turkish ties, EU Enlargement
Commissioner Stefan Fule said the aim is to “turn this one-flower policy into a full flourishing garden.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
