A Japanese government fiscal advisory
panel warned that a failure to improve the nation’s finances
could trigger a spike in bond yields that makes central bank
easing less effective.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe needs to map out a plan to curb
the world’s largest public debt and maintain confidence in the
nation’s bonds, the panel, which includes academics and company
executives, said in a  report  released in Tokyo today.  “If the government fails to show concrete success in
fiscal reform, the large bond purchases by the  Bank of Japan 
over the next two years could be seen as debt monetization, and
this may cause a sharp spike in yields, weakening the effect of
monetary easing,” the report said.  Abe and Bank of  Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda are
grappling with reviving the economy without blowing out the
nation’s debt burden, projected by the  International Monetary
Fund  to reach 245 percent of gross domestic product this year,
the highest in the world. Volatility in stocks and bonds is
underscoring the challenge, with the Topix Index falling 3.4
percent today after a one-day 6.9 percent decline last week.  The panel also said Japanese policy makers will need
eventually to be alert to the risks associated with exiting from
monetary easing. Cutting back on bond purchases could lead to a
“spike” in long-term yields, it said.  The panel has sent  reports  to the Ministry of Finance 10
times since 2001, and last submitted a  report  in January this
year, the ministy's website shows.   To contact the reporter on this story:
