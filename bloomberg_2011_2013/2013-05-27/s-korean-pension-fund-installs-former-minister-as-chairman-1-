Choi Kwang, a former South Korean
government minister, took office today as chairman of the
National Pension Service, the nation’s biggest investor, the
agency said.  Choi, who headed the Ministry of Health and Welfare in
1997-1998, will lead the  pension service , which has about $350
billion in assets, the NPS said in a statement to media
organizations today. The 66-year-old official was chosen by a
seven-member committee and his nomination was announced in a May
24 statement from the health and welfare ministry, which
oversees the NPS.  The ministry has been seeking to diversify the NPS’s
investments to boost returns for its members. The agency is
aiming to increase the amount of funds invested in overseas
stocks to more than 10 percent by 2017 from 5.7 percent in 2011,
according an asset-allocation  plan  posted on the ministry’s
website on May 31, 2012. The plan calls for the percentage of
investments in foreign bonds to rise to less than 10 percent in
2017 from 4.2 percent in 2011.  “We will work toward securing liquidity, stable and long-term profit and also diversifying our investment portfolio as
well as fulfilling our social responsibilities,” Choi said in
notes for a speech to be presented at his inauguration ceremony
at the pension service’s office in  Seoul  today.  Choi taught economics at Hankuk University of Foreign
Studies from 1985 to February this year and served as the head
of the Korea Institute of Public Finance from 1995-1997 before
taking office as health minister, the NPS said in today’s
statement to the media.  Former NPS Chairman Jun Kwang Woo offered his resignation
in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
