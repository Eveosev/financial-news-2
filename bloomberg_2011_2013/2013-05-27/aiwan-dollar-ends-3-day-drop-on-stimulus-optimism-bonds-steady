The  Taiwan dollar  climbed, halting a
three-day decline, on speculation policy makers will this week
roll out measures to boost the economy after the government
lowered the island’s growth forecast for the year.  The stimulus may include steering life insurance funds to
public construction projects, the Commercial Times reported,
citing officials. The economy grew a revised 3.97 percent in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said
on May 24 while cutting its 2013 estimate to 2.4 percent from
3.59 percent. The U.S. dollar’s strength has contributed to a
weakening of Asian currencies, and the Taiwan dollar and  Thai
baht  are most at risk, Societe Generale wrote in a note.  “There’s some optimism the Taiwan government may announce
an economic stimulus plan this week following the sharp downside
growth revision,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a strategist at  Societe
Generale  SA in  Hong Kong . “The local dollar’s strength is
unlikely to be long-lasting amidst weakening Asia currency
pressure across the region.”  The Taiwan dollar rose 0.4 percent to NT$29.91 against the
greenback as of 9:48 a.m. local time, show prices from Taipei
Forex Inc. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, climbed one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.93 percent.  The yield on the 1.125 percent government bonds due March
2023 traded at 1.289 percent, little changed from 1.294 percent
at the end of last week, according to Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
