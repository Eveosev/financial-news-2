Hong Kong’s transport department will
take over an investigation into allegations of past negligence
at the city’s marine agency that arose after a ferry collision
killed 39 people last year.  The probe will be taken over from the Marine Department
itself, which was looking into reports of problems within its
ranks that surfaced as part of an inquiry into the October 2012
crash.  Hong Kong Transport and Housing Secretary Anthony Cheung
said in a statement yesterday he was making the move “to ensure
the procedural integrity and impartiality of the
investigation.” Investigators will look for “possible
maladministration and neglect of duty,” Cheung said.  The collision, the city’s worst maritime disaster in four
decades, occurred as the ferry brought employees of Hongkong
Electric Co. and their relatives to Victoria Harbor to watch a
fireworks display. An April report found poor maintenance and
the absence of children’s life jackets on the ferry caused some
of the deaths.  To contact the reporter on this story:
