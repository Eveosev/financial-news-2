Indian bonds rose for a second day on
concern the slowest economic growth and pace of inflation since
2009 will prompt the central bank to cut borrowing costs.  Gross domestic product  increased  4.8 percent in the three
months through March, according to the median of 25 estimates in
a Bloomberg survey before data due May 31. That compares with a
4.5 percent rise in the previous quarter, the slowest pace since
2009.  Wholesale prices  rose 4.89 percent in April, the least in
41 months, official data show. The  Reserve Bank  of  India  has
reduced the repurchase rate by 75 basis points so far this year
to 7.25 percent. The rupee was little changed after a three-week
slump.  “There is little to suggest that the economy will witness
a V-shaped recovery,” Radhika Rao, an economist at DBS Bank
Ltd. in  Singapore , wrote in a research report today. “A much
weaker-than-consensus number is likely to strengthen the case
for the central bank to deliver more rate cuts, especially as
inflationary pressures decelerate.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent government bonds June 2022
dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.33
percent as of 10:16 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system.  The rupee was steady at 55.7050 per dollar, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 56.0150 on May 23, the
lowest level since Sept. 6. One-month implied volatility, a
gauge of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, fell 11 basis points to 8.99 percent.  Technical charts indicate the dollar is “overbought” and
this may result in the rupee strengthening to around 55 against
the greenback, according to Edelweiss Financial Advisors Ltd. If
the dollar rises past 56.10, it could advance to 57.30, which
would be near the record reached in June last year, the company
said in a research report today.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 56.59 per
dollar, compared with 56.52 on May 24, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 56.54 versus 56.70. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
