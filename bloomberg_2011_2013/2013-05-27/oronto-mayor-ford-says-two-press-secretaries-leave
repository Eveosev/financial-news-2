Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, facing
allegations he was video-taped smoking crack cocaine, said his
two press aides have left, joining his former chief of staff who
was ousted last week.  Press Secretary George Christopolous and communications
assistant Isaac Ransom are “no longer employed” in the mayor’s
office. Sunny Petrujkic will be the interim press secretary
until further notice, according to a statement today from the
office of the mayor of  Canada ’s biggest city. Amin Massoudi,
executive assistant to city councilor Doug Ford, Rob Ford’s
brother, will be communications director for Rob, the mayor
said.  The departures come less than two weeks after the Toronto
Star newspaper reported that two of its reporters watched a
cellphone video allegedly showing Ford smoking from a crack
cocaine pipe. Ford said last week he doesn’t use crack cocaine
and isn’t a cocaine addict.  Ford’s former chief of staff Mark Towhey was fired last
week.  “I’m not going to comment on personnel issues,” Ford told
reporters today, while declining to answer questions related to
the scandal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
