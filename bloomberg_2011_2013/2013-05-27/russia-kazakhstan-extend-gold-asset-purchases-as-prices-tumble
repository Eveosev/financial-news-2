Russia and Kazakhstan expanded their
gold reserves for a seventh straight month in April, buying the
metal to diversify assets even as prices slumped the most in
three decades.  Russian holdings, the seventh-largest by country, climbed
8.4 metric tons to 990 tons, taking gains this year to 3.4
percent after expanding by 8.5 percent in 2012, International
Monetary Fund data show. Kazakhstan’s hoard grew 2.6 tons to
125.5 tons, taking the increase to 8.9 percent this year after a
41 percent expansion in 2012, data on the website showed.  Gold plunged into a  bear market  April 12 and by the end of
the following session had lost 14 percent, the biggest two-day
drop since 1983. The drop was driven by some investors losing
faith in the metal as a store of value, spurring record
reductions from holdings in  exchange-traded products  amid
speculation that the global economy is recovering.  “Some central banks would have taken advantage of the
lower prices to build their gold assets,” said Alexandra Knight,
an economist at National Australia Bank Ltd. in  Melbourne .
“With the general mood in the market quite bearish, perhaps
some others are factoring in the potential for lower prices and
holding off purchases for now. But the longer-term trend for
central banks to increase  gold reserves  remains intact.”  Gold for immediate delivery, which dropped to a two-year
low of $1,321.95 an ounce on April 16, traded 0.4 percent higher
at $1,391.43 at 10:53 a.m. in Singapore. Bullion has declined 17
percent in 2013 after advancing for the past 12 years.  Portfolio Diversification  Central banks bought 534.6 tons of gold last year, the most
since 1964, and may add as much as 550 tons in 2013, the World
Gold Council estimates. While central-bank purchases fell 5.2
percent in the three months through March, they totaled more
than 100 tons for the seventh straight quarter, according to
council data.  The banks are less attracted to bullion as an overall
strategy of portfolio diversification and the price drop should
not lure them away from a long-term policy of gold accumulation,
according to HSBC Securities (USA) Inc.’s  James Steel . Still,
reserve managers tend to be conservative and expecting central
banks to step in and support a falling market is unrealistic,
Credit Suisse analysts including Ric Deverell wrote in a May 22
report.  Turkey’s holdings rose 18.2 tons to 427.1 tons in April,
increasing for a 10th month as it accepted gold in its  reserve
requirements  from commercial banks. Belarus’s holdings expanded
for a seventh month, while Azerbaijan’s and  Greece ’s holdings
climbed for a fourth month, according to the IMF data.  Mexico  cut its gold reserves for a 12th month and  Canada 
reduced holdings for a fourth month, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
