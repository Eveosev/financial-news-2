Bank Indonesia  is studying whether to
impose stricter loan-to-value rules for mortgages in regions
where property demand is expanding too quickly, Deputy Governor
Perry Warjiyo said.  The central bank may implement such a plan if the
government doesn’t increase the price of subsidized fuel,
Warjiyo said in Jakarta today. Higher energy costs would lead to
a slowdown in the economy and curb demand for homes, he said.
Finance Minister Chatib Basri said May 22 the government plans
to raise subsidized fuel prices in June.  “If there’s no fuel-price policy, our choice of instrument
will tend to be” loan-to-value ratios, Warjiyo said. Higher
fuel costs will lead to “a self-correction in properties so
that we can focus more on the interest-rate policy to curb
short-term inflation expectation.”  The central bank may tighten the loan-to-value, or LTV,
ratios for buyers of second or third properties such as houses
and apartments, Warjiyo said.  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy has grown more than 6
percent for  10 straight quarters , boosted by record-low
borrowing costs and foreign investment.  Bank Indonesia  began
requiring lenders to demand minimum down-payments for housing
and vehicle loans in June last year.  The rule includes setting the LTV ratio for property
borrowings at a maximum of 70 percent and the minimum initial
payment for motorcycles at 25 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
