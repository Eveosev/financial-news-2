Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. surged
by the 10 percent daily limit in Shanghai trading on speculation
a proposal to allow unlimited reuse of license plates in the
city where its based will spur vehicle sales.  The automaker, which has manufacturing ventures with  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203)  and Honda Motor Co., rose to 9.15  yuan  as of 2:45
p.m. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was little changed.
The stock has climbed 86 percent since last year’s low in
November as Japanese brands recovered from the consumer backlash
triggered by a territorial dispute.  The government of Guangzhou, where the company is based,
released a consultation paper on May 25 outlining revisions to
its policy of distributing license plates. The proposed changes
come less than a year after the city government imposed an
annual quota of 120,000 new license plates to rein in congestion
and air pollution.  “The proposals are good news for auto sales in the city,”
 Harry Chen , an analyst with Guotai Junan Securities Co. in
Shenzhen, said in a telephone interview. “Guangzhou Auto is
also benefiting from the recovery in sales and introduction of
new models.”  Guangzhou uses both an auction and lottery to distribute
the license plates. Other cities in  China  that cap the number of
new vehicles include Beijing, which uses a monthly lottery, and
Shanghai, where successful bids exceeded 90,000 yuan ($14,700)
this year.  Guangzhou Auto, which also produces the Viaggio car with
 Fiat SpA (F) , will manufacture some Jeep models with the Turin,
Italy-based carmaker.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
