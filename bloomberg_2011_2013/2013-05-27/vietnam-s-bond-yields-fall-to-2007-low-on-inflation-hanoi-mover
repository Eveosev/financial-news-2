Vietnam ’s bonds rose, sending the
benchmark five-year yield to the lowest level since 2007, after
the government reported the slowest inflation in nine months.
The dong was little changed.  Consumer prices  climbed 6.36 percent this month from a year
earlier after rising 6.61 percent in April, the General
Statistics Office in Hanoi said May 24. Living costs declined
0.06 percent from last month. Slower inflation boosts returns
from fixed-income securities.  The five-year yield slid nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 8.11 percent, the least since November
2007, according to a daily fixing from lenders compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate on three-year notes fell 13 basis points to
7.08 percent, the lowest since June 2007.  “The drop in monthly inflation and surplus liquidity have
prompted banks to increase investments in government debt,”
said Hoang Thanh Tam, head of the fixed-income department at
Vietnam Maritime Commercial Joint-Stock Bank in Hanoi. “Bonds
are still good investments, given the economic situation.”  Bank credit in Vietnam expanded 2.29 percent as of May 22
from the end of 2012, the central bank said on its website
today. The monetary authority targets a 12 percent lending
expansion for the year.  Interest rates  on dong deposits dropped
to as low as 5 percent at local lenders, compared with a
regulatory limit of 7.5 percent, according to the statement.  Debt Sales  Vietnam’s State Treasury will increase total bond sales
this year to 170 trillion dong ($8.1 billion), from an initial
plan for 150 trillion dong, Dau Tu Chung Khoan magazine reported
today, citing a treasury official it didn’t identify. The
government will offer 50 trillion dong of three-year notes and
raise the remaining amount selling two-, five-, 10- and 15-year
securities, according to the report.  The dong was at 21,000 per dollar as of 4:45 p.m. in Hanoi,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set
its  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since December 2011,
according to its website. The currency is allowed to trade as
much as 1 percent on either side of the daily fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
