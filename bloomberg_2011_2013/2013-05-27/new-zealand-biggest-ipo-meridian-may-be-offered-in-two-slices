New Zealand ’s government may offer
shares in Meridian Energy Ltd., the nation’s largest power
company, in two separate sales to ensure that most of it remains
in local hands, Prime Minister John Key said.  “We wouldn’t have to float 49 percent in one day,” Key
told reporters in Wellington, referring to the maximum size of
the stake in Meridian that will be offered. The government
“might choose to do that if that’s what the interest is, but it
could always do that in two slices.”  Key this month raised NZ$1.7 billion ($1.4 billion) selling
almost half of Mighty River Power Ltd. in the nation’s largest
initial public offering and the first government share sale in a
program aiming to raise up to NZ$7 billion. Shares in Meridian
will be offered in the second half of the year and it will be a
larger IPO, Key said today.  The government expects to raise about NZ$3 billion from
selling the Meridian stake and is targeting 85 percent local
ownership, including its majority portion, Key said. It wants
retail investors to take up about a third of the offer, which
may lead to “digestion” issues that require selling Meridian’s
shares in more than one block, he said.  Mighty River  shares  fell 4.5 percent to NZ$2.36 at the 5
p.m. close in Wellington, the lowest finish since the shares
began trading on May 10. They were issued to investors at
NZ$2.50 apiece.  Key said he wasn’t concerned by the stock’s decline and any
implications for demand for Meridian shares.  “That’s something way into the future,” he said. “We are
comfortable where things are at.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
