John Q. Hammons, who developed 210
hotel properties in 40 states during a 52-year career, died in
Springfield,  Missouri . He was 94.  Hammons created John Q. Hammons Hotels in 1969 and became
the largest private, independent upscale-hotel manager in the
U.S., working with brands including Marriott, Renaissance and
Embassy Suites, the company said yesterday in a statement. Today
the company operates 78 hotels in 24 states.  “Hammons was a giant in the hospitality industry and was
unwavering in his commitment to exceptional quality and service
and to giving back to the community,” Jacqueline Dowdy, chief
executive officer of John Q Hammons Hotels & Resorts, said in
the statement. “He was a great mentor and friend and will be
missed by all who came to know him.”  Hammons, whose proper name is James, is survived by his
wife Juanita Hammons.  Hammons started in the hotel industry in 1958 and, with Roy
Winegardner, purchased 10 Holiday Inn franchises, according to
the statement. In the past 50 years, Hammons donated to
Springfield and other organizations, including funding of the
Hammons Heart Institute and Hammons Life Line helicopter for St.
John’s Regional Health Center in Springfield.  To contact the reporter on this story:
