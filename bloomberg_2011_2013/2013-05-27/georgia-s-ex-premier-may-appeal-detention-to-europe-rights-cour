 Vano Merabishvili, a former Georgian
premier and an ally of President Mikheil Saakashvili who was
detained this month, may appeal his pre-trial detention to the
European Court of Human Rights, his lawyer said.  Merabishvili, who has been charged with abuse of office and
embezzlement, has several months to challenge a May 22 ruling by
a city court in Kutaisi, the lawyer, Giorgi Chiviashvili, told
reporters today in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi.  Merabishvili was denied bail and sentenced to two months in
pre-trial detention by the Kutaisi court. He denies any
wrongdoing and denounces his prosecution as politically
motivated, his lawyer said.  Merabishvili, who’s also served as interior minister and
led a revamp of the police, was arrested on May 21 along with
former Health Minister Zurab Tchiaberashvili. Tchiaberashvili
was released on bail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
