The yield on  Malaysia ’s five-year
government bonds climbed to a three-week high as speculation the
Federal Reserve will rein in monetary stimulus damped demand for
emerging-market assets. The ringgit fell.  Orders for U.S. durable goods increased more than forecast
in April, a May 24 report showed, while Fed Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke said last week the authorities could slow debt
purchases if the economy showed sustained signs of improvement.
Malaysia’s opposition alliance held a series of rallies around
the country, the latest on May 23, alleging fraud in May 5
elections that kept Prime Minister Najib Razak in power.  “People have some concerns that the Federal Reserve may
slow down the pace of asset purchases a bit,” said Jackit Wong,
a regional economist at Natixis Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. The
protest rallies in Malaysia are “something that investors would
have concerns about,” she said.  The yield on the 3.26 percent notes due March 2018 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, from the May 23 close to
3.16 percent as of 10 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, the highest level
since May 3, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Malaysian
financial markets were shut on May 24 for a public holiday.  The ringgit declined 0.2 percent to 3.0385 per dollar, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price
options, dropped eight basis points to 7.34 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
