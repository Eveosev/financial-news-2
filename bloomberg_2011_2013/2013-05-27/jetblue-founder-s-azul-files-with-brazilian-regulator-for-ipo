Azul Linhas Aereas Brasileiras SA,
the Brazilian air carrier created by JetBlue Airways Corp.
founder  David Neeleman , filed with the country’s securities
regulator to sell shares in an initial public offering.  The company applied on May 24 to list preferred shares on
the BM&FBovespa, according to an e-mailed statement.  Azul may raise as much as 1.1 billion reais ($540 million)
in a primary offering that should take place in the following
two months, Sao Paulo-based newspaper Valor Economico reported
today without saying how it got the information. The company’s
goal is to buy more airplanes and expand the number of flights
it currently offers, the newspaper reported, adding that Banco
Santander Brasil SA will lead the sale, and  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Itau BBA SA and  Banco do Brasil SA  will
help manage the operation.  The air carrier’s press office declined to comment on
details of the deal when contacted by phone by  Bloomberg News .  Azul started in 2008 and is Brazil’s third-biggest airline
by market share. It has 118 planes, 9,000 employees and operates
875 daily flights, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
