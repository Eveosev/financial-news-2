The  Vancouver Canucks  fired coach
Alain Vigneault and two assistants after the team was swept by
the  San Jose Sharks  in the National Hockey League playoffs.  The 52-year-old Vigneault, associate coach Rick Bowness and
assistant coach Newell Brown were dismissed yesterday by Canucks
President Michael Gillis.  The Canucks finished the regular season with a 26-15-7
record and won the Northwest Division title before losing to the
Sharks in the first round of the postseason. The Canucks were 1-8 in the playoffs during the past two seasons.  “There comes a point in time where the message has to
change and we have to be better,” Gillis said during a news
conference. “We simply didn’t get the result we expected and,
in this business, you have to get results.”  The Canucks’ career leader in coaching wins, Vigneault had
a 313-170-57 regular-season record during his seven seasons in
 Vancouver  and a 33-32 playoff record. He led the club to six
division titles and an appearance in the 2011 Stanley Cup finals.
He also was the Montreal Canadiens’ coach in 1997-2001.  “To work in a city with such passionate and loyal fans is
a privilege,” Vigneault said on the team’s website. “I enjoyed
every moment of it. I am a career coach and it is what I love to
do. I hope to coach again in this league and will always have
good memories of my time and the fans in Vancouver.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
