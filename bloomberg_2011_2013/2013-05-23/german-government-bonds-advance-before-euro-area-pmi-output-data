Spanish and Italian bonds led losses
among the securities of  Europe ’s so-called peripheral nations as
 China ’s manufacturing and euro-area services and factory output
all contracted, sapping demand for higher-yielding assets.  Spanish  five-year  yields climbed the most in eight weeks as
the nation’s borrowing costs increased at a 4.08 billion-euro
($5.26 billion) sale of debt maturing between 2016 and 2026.
Portuguese and Greek bonds also slid as Europe’s benchmark stock
index slumped 2 percent and  Japan ’s Topix index tumbled the most
since March 2011. German bunds were little changed.  “There’s a bit of a reduction in risk appetite following
the big moves down in Japanese equities, so it’s more the macro
theme,” said  Peter Chatwell , a senior fixed-income strategist
at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in  London . “Of
course, we’ve got the supply factors also.”  Spain’s five-year note yield rose 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, to 3.09 percent at 4:42 p.m. London time. It
advanced as much as 17 basis points, the steepest gain since
March 27. The 4.5 percent bond due January 2018 fell 0.56, or
5.60 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 106.055.  Spanish  10-year yields  climbed 11 basis points to 4.29
percent after gaining as much as 15 basis points, the most since
March 18. Rates on similar-maturity Italian debt rose 12 basis
points to 4.03 percent.  Manufacturing Shrinks  An index of China’s manufacturing based on a survey of
 purchasing managers  fell to 49.6 in May from 50.4 in April, HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said. A composite index of
euro-area manufacturing and services industries was 47.7 in May
below the 50 level that divides contraction from expansion for a
16th month, London-based Markit Economics said.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index of shares slid as much as 2.6
percent. Japan’s  Topix Index (TPX)  slumped 6.9 percent amid the
highest volume on record.  Portugal’s  10-year yields  climbed 19 basis points to 5.44
percent and  Greece ’s increased 70 basis points to 8.83 percent.  The Spanish Treasury sold five-year notes at an average
yield of 3.001 percent, up from 2.789 percent at a previous
auction on May 9. The nation sold three-year debt at 2.442
percent, compared with 2.247 percent on May 9, and bonds due in
2026 at 4.54 percent, versus 4.336 percent on May 9.  “Despite Spain achieving its targeted issue volume this is
a fairly weak auction result,” Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International in London, wrote in
a note to clients. “Today we have seen a relatively aggressive
risk-off move with  Spain  and  Italy  both widening significantly
versus bunds. It appears that this risk-off is largely an equity
led move.”  German Bunds  The extra yield, or spread, that investors get for holding
Spain’s 10-year bonds instead of bunds rose 10 basis points to
285 basis points, after reaching the most since May 17. The
Italian-German 10-year yield spread rose 10 basis points to 259
basis points.  Spain is considering selling 15-year bonds through banks
this year as well as issuing inflation-linked and dollar-denominated debt as it seeks to tap investor demand, Deputy
Treasury Head Ignacio Fernandez-Palomero Morales said yesterday.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yielded 1.44 percent after dropping
by the most since May 16.  Volatility on Portuguese bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Belgium and  France , according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Spanish bonds lost 0.2 percent this month through
yesterday, cutting their returns this year to 8.1 percent,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian debt earned
5 percent in 2013 while German bunds are little changed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
