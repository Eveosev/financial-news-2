Lois Lerner of the Internal Revenue
Service was asked to resign and refused, said Senator  Charles
Grassley , an Iowa Republican.  Grassley made the comment in an e-mailed statement. Lerner
is the mid-level IRS employee at the center of the controversy
over scrutiny of small-government groups seeking tax-exempt
status.  She was replaced on an acting basis today, the IRS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
