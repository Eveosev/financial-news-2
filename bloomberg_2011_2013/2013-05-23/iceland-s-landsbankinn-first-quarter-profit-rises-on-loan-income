Landsbankinn hf , the Icelandic state-created successor to failed Landsbanki Islands hf, said first-quarter profit rose on income from loans and advances acquired
at a “deep discount.”  Net income increased 4 percent to 8 billion kronur ($64.7
million) from 7.7 billion kronur a year earlier, the Reykjavik-based bank said today in a statement. Net interest income
climbed 15 percent to 9.9 billion kronur, while net fee- and
commission-income increased to 1.4 billion kronur from 1 billion
kronur.  Landsbankinn was created in 2008 from the domestic
operations of Landsbanki Islands hf, which collapsed after it
was unable to secure short-term funding. Landsbanki’s failure
left 350,000 depositors in the lender’s Icesave Internet
accounts in the U.K. and Netherlands at risk of losing their
life savings. The liquidated assets from Landsbanki’s estate are
now expected to cover all the deposits in full.  The bank’s capital adequacy ratio rose to 26.6 percent by
the end of March from 22.1 percent at the start of 2013.
Impairments fell to 659 million kronur from 1.3 billion kronur,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
