The European Union is weighing plans
for an EU-wide system to allow damages claims from price-fixing
victims, in a move that would stop short of forcing nations to
allow group lawsuits.  Proposals on private enforcement actions will seek to
remedy “marked differences” between countries on lawsuits for
compensation in cases of national or EU competition law
violations, according to draft plans obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Such differences “lead to uncertainty concerning the
conditions under which injured parties can exercise the right to
compensation,” according to the draft. “As injured parties
often choose” their own country’s courts “to claim damages,
the discrepancies between the rules of the different member
states lead to an un-level playing field as regards actions for
damages.”  Private damages lawsuits are rare in national courts across
 Europe . The Brussels-based European Commission has championed
such lawsuits as a way to compensate victims of illegal
monopolies and cartels ranging from plots to fix air-cargo fuel
and security surcharges to the price of television tubes.  While EU nations won’t be obliged to introduce provisions
for group lawsuits for EU antitrust breaches, such a possibility
could also be “of value” for data-privacy violations as well
as consumer and environment protection, according to separate
guidelines on group lawsuits, also known as collective redress.  “A possibility of joining claims and pursuing them
collectively may constitute better means of access to justice,
in particular when the cost of individual lawsuits would deter
the harmed individuals from going to court,” according to the
commission document.  Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for competition commissioner
 Joaquin Almunia , declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
