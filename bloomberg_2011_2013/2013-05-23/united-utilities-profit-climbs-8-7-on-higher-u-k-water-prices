United Utilities Plc (UU/) , the U.K.’s
largest publicly traded water company, said fiscal full-year
profit rose 8.7 percent as higher prices helped counter lower
volumes and a shift by customers to meters from fixed rates.  Pretax profit climbed to 304.7 million pounds ($458
million) in the year through March from 280.4 million pounds a
year earlier, the Warrington, England-based company said today
in a statement. Sales advanced 5 percent to 1.64 billion pounds.
The company will pay a dividend of 34.32 pence a share.  The results reflect an increase in regulated prices, which
are determined by industry regulator Ofwat every five years
based on a formula linked to inflation. The higher rates helped
offset a switch by more customers to water meters, which tend to
cut household consumption and reduce bills.  United Utilities invested 787 million pounds in its network
in the 12-month period, taking its total investment since 2010
to more than 2 billion pounds. The company plans to invest 800
million pounds in the current fiscal year to meet regulatory
targets that require it to spend more than 3 billion pounds
through 2015 on its facilities and network.  “We are improving the quality and reliability of our
infrastructure and, across the 2010-15 period, expect to
reinvest around 200 million pounds of capital expenditure
outperformance for the benefit of our customers and the
environment,” Steve Mogford, chief executive officer, said in
the statement.  United Utilities dropped 0.6 percent to 777 pence in  London 
as of 8:02 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
