The Netherlands became the last
shareholder of Urenco Ltd., the processor of uranium for atomic
reactors, to announce plans to sell its stake.  The Dutch government wants to sell its one-third stake in
Urenco when the “public interest in terms of non-proliferation,
nuclear safety and supply security” has been safeguarded,
Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem wrote today in a letter to
parliament.  Its intention comes after EON SE and RWE AG,  Germany ’s two
largest utilities which together hold a one-third stake, as well
as the British government, which owns the remaining interest,
all said they’d like to sell. Urenco may be valued at about $14
billion, the Financial Times reported last month.  “Together with the other shareholders preparations for the
sale of shares have begun,” the government said in a statement.
“The Dutch government expects to see positive interest in the
sale of its shares.”  The proceeds of the sale will be used to pay off the
national debt, the minister said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
