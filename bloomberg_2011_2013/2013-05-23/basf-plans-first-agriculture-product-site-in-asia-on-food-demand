BASF SE (BAS)  plans to build its first
crop-protection chemical plant in Asia as growing food needs in
the region boost demand for herbicides.  The new formulation and packaging plant will be built in
Rudong, Jiangsu Province in  China , the Ludwigshafen, Germany-based company said today in a statement. The site, to cost a
“double-digit-million” euro amount, will be ready next year
and employ more than 100 people.  BASF, which spends 430 million euros ($554 million) on
research and development at its herbicide and fungicide unit,
will invest an average of 300 million euros annually on
additional production sites, it said today. The chemical maker
is counting on Asia to be one of the main growth drivers to help
it achieve a goal of 110 billion euros in revenue by the end of
the decade.  “We are specifically investing in research, development
and production in  Asia  Pacific as part of BASF’s globalization
efforts, which will enhance our collaboration with growers in
the region,” Markus Heldt, head of the company’s crop
protection unit, said in today’s statement.  BASF is also considering a second R&D hub in the region and
will more than double the number of scientist there by 2020, it
said. A total of 250 people will be hired.  To contact the reporter on this story:
