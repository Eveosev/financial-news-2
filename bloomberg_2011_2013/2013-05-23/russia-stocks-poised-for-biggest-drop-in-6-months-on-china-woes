Russian  equities  fell for the first
time in five days as crude oil tumbled and disappointing Chinese
manufacturing data spurred declines in metal producers. Price
swings on the benchmark gauge surged.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  decreased 2.2 percent to 1,416.13 by 10:36
a.m. in Moscow, a 9.4 percent drop from this year’s high and
poised for the biggest retreat since Nov. 13. The volume of
shares traded was 96 percent above the measure’s 30-day average,
while 10-day price swings jumped to 23.844, the highest since
Sept. 26.  OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , OAO Severstal and OAO Novolipetsk Steel fell at
least 3 percent as manufacturing in  China  unexpectedly
contracted for the first time in seven months, a report from
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics showed. Crude,  Russia ’s
main export earner, declined 1.2 percent to $93.17 a barrel in
 New York . Russia receives about half of its budget revenue from
oil and natural gas. The Standard & Poor’s  GSCI Commodities (SPGSCI) 
Index dropped 0.8 percent to 620.69, dropping for the third day.  “It will be difficult for emerging market equities to
attract new investor funds if the largest EM economy continues
to slow ahead of expectations,” Slava Smolyaninov, a Moscow-based analyst at UralSib Capital, said in an e-mailed note
today. “Commodities are also taking a hit. That sets a very
cautious backdrop for the Russian ruble and equities.”  VTB Group dropped 3.7 percent to 4.79 kopeks after it sold
102.5 billion rubles ($3.3 billion) of shares on the Moscow
Exchange in an offering that closed yesterday. China
Construction Bank bought $100 million VTB shares in the
placement, RIA Novosti reported yesterday, citing an
unidentified person. Norges Bank Investment Management was the
biggest investor in VTB’s sale, according to RIA.  Open Interest  Utilities led the declines among nine industry groups on
the Micex, losing 3.7 percent on average.  Open interest  on RTS stock futures climbed to the highest
level in eight months yesterday. Volumes surged amid comments
from Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  that raising
 interest rates  or reducing asset purchases too soon would
endanger the U.S. recovery. The number of contracts that have
yet to be closed, liquidated or delivered on Moscow’s dollar-denominated  RTS index (RTSI$)  exceeded 1 million this week, the highest
level since September, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Russia’s equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
 emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg. The Micex trades at 5.2
times its 12-month estimated earnings and has lost 4 percent
this year, compared with a 10.5 multiple for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index, which has dropped 2.7 percent in the period.  The dollar-denominated RTS Index fell 3.1 percent to
1,416.67. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in  stock futures , rose 7.6 percent to 21.85 today, poised
for the highest since April 23. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity
Index of the most-traded Russian companies in the U.S. declined
1.2 percent to 94.51 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
