Portugal ’s Finance Ministry said the
government posted a wider deficit in the four months through
April after spending rose more than tax revenue.  Based on comparable figures, the deficit of the central
administration and social security agency was 2.5 billion euros
($3.2 billion) compared with a deficit of 1.9 billion euros in
the same period of 2012, the Finance Ministry’s budget office
said in a  report  on its website.  Spending rose 5.1 percent. Tax revenue increased 3.4
percent, with revenue from indirect taxes falling 4.8 percent
and revenue from direct taxes rising 17.9 percent.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  on May 3 announced
measures intended to generate savings of about 4.8 billion euros
through 2015 that include reducing the number of state workers
as he tries to meet the terms of a 78 billion-euro aid program
from the European Union and International Monetary Fund.
Government ministries will have to reduce spending on purchases
of goods and services by at least 10 percent next year, Coelho
said on May 3.  The government on March 15 announced less ambitious targets
for narrowing its budget deficit as it forecast the economy will
shrink twice as much as previously estimated this year. The
government targets a deficit equivalent to 5.5 percent of gross
domestic product in 2013, 4 percent in 2014 and below the EU’s 3
percent limit in 2015, when it aims for a 2.5 percent gap. It
forecasts debt will peak at 123.7 percent of GDP in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
