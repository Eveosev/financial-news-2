Suez Environnement will remain a
“spectator” to talks on the future of Saur as it has no
interest in acquiring  France ’s third-largest water utility,
according to Chief Executive Officer Jean-Louis Chaussade.  “Saur’s water services are low-cost and don’t correspond
to my concept of water distribution in France and elsewhere,”
he told the company’s annual general meeting today. Saur’s debt
“has to be resolved and we can’t do much about that.”  Talks are ongoing between shareholders and lenders of Saur
on the future of the utility.  Le Figaro  newspaper reported today
talks have hit hurdles over Saur’s debt and capital needs.  Seche Environnement Chief Executive Officer Joel Seche has
long sought to gain a majority stake in Saur, increasing his
holding from the 33 percent he holds now. Saur’s other
shareholders include the investment fund FSI with 38 percent,
Axa Private Equity with 17 percent and Cube Infrastructure Fund
with 12 percent, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
