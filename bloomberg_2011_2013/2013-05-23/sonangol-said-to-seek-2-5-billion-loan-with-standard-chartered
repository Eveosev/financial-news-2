Sonangol EP,  Angola ’s state-owned oil
company, is raising a $2.5 billion loan arranged by  Standard
Chartered Plc (STAN) , according to two people with knowledge of the
matter.  The five-year debt will pay an interest margin of more than
300 basis points, or 3 percentage points, greater than the
London interbank offered rate, said the people, who asked not to
be identified because the terms are private. Additional lenders
will join the deal, which is due to be funded at the end of May.  Luanda, Angola-based Sonangol regularly borrows from
international banks and obtained a $1.5 billion five-year  term
loan  in September 2012.  Standard Chartered  was bookrunner of
that deal which pays a margin of 350 basis points more than
Libor, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Joao Rosa Santos, a Luanda-based spokesman for the company,
didn’t answer two telephone calls seeking comment on the
financing. Telephone calls and e-mails to the company weren’t
immediately answered.  Sonangol boosted oil output by 4.5 percent last year and
plans to spend $8.8 billion on exploration in the next decade,
Francisco de Lemos Jose Maria, chief executive officer of the
company, said in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
