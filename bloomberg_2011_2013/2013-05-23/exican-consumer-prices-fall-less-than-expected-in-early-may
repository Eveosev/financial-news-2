Mexico’s  consumer prices  fell less
than expected in early May, pushing  annual (MXCPYOY)  inflation further
above the central bank’s target range.  Prices slid 0.35 percent in the first two weeks of the
month, the national statistics agency said today on its website,
compared with the 0.42 percent drop that was the median estimate
of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Annual inflation
quickened to 4.72 percent from 4.65 percent in April, above the
central bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target range. Core prices,
which exclude energy and farm costs, rose 0.14 percent in early
May, compared with an increase of 0.10 percent forecast in a
Bloomberg survey.  Slowing economic growth, including retail sales that
contracted for two consecutive months, have supported
economists’ and traders’ forecasts that the central bank will
cut rates again this year after slashing them half a point in
March to 4 percent. Policy makers, who left borrowing costs on
hold in April, said inflation will slow to within their target
range in the second half of the year.  The yield on inflation-linked bonds maturing December 2013
fell 4 basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.31 percent,
at 8:11 a.m. in  Mexico  City. The peso weakened 0.6 percent to
12.4959 per dollar and has risen 2.9 percent this year, the most
of 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Six-month interest rate swaps rose 1 basis point to 4.20
percent. The current swap rate indicates traders see a 60
percent chance the bank will lower rates by October. As recently
as May 3, the likelihood was 32 percent.  Retail sales  surprised analysts in March by shrinking 2.4
percent from a year earlier after plunging 2.6 percent in
February, the first back-to-back decline since the 2009
recession, the statistics institute reported yesterday.  Gross
domestic product  rose 0.8 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier, less than the 1.1 percent forecast in a Bloomberg
survey and the slowest pace since the aftermath of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.’s collapse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
