Treasuries rose after investors won
the largest share of 10-year inflation-indexed notes sold today
at any auction since at least 2003 amid renewed debate over
whether the  Federal Reserve  will slow monetary stimulus.  Investors bought about 69 percent of the $13 billion in
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities issued, according to
data going back to July 2003 that was compiled by Bloomberg.
TIPS maturing in 10 years or more lost 5.4 percent this year as
inflation expectations fell, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data.  “They’ve certainly cheapened up,” said  Christopher Sullivan , who oversees $2.1 billion as chief investment officer
at United Nations Federal Credit Union in  New York . “Investor
demand is certainly there.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year  note  fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.02 percent at 4:59 p.m.
New York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The
price of the 1.75 percent security due May 2023 rose 7/32, or
$2.19 per $1,000 face value, to 97 19/32. The rate earlier
climbed to 2.07 percent, the most since March 14.  The 10-year TIPS were sold today at a yield of negative
0.225 percent, compared with a Bloomberg News forecast of
negative 0.244 percent. A previous auction of $13 billion of the
securities on March 21 yielded negative 0.602 percent.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and similar-maturity TIPS was at 2.25 percentage points, at almost the 2.23
percentage points reached May 17, the least since Aug. 9. The
 consumer price index  decreased 0.4 percent, the biggest decline
since December 2008, after falling 0.2 percent in March,
according to Labor Department figures released last week.  Negative Returns  Trading volume dropped by 27.5 percent to $480.1 billion
from $660 billion yesterday, the highest level in data going
back to 2004, according to ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer
broker of  U.S. government debt . The average daily volume for
this year is $291 billion.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index measuring price
swings in Treasuries rose to 68.2 basis points, the highest
level since November. It dropped May 9 to an all-time low of
48.87 basis points. The measure averaged 62.37 basis points
during the past 12 months.  Inflation-protected Treasuries have fallen 2.8 percent,
compared with a loss of 0.6 percent for fixed rate U.S.
government debt, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. For the month, TIPS have declined 3.2 percent, on
track for their worst monthly performance since October 2008,
when they lost 8.5 percent as investor expectations for
inflation collapsed in the wake of the financial crisis.  Annual Returns  The longer-term TIPS are on track to lose money for the
first time since 2006, when the Fed ended a two-year cycle of 17
consecutive increases to its overnight benchmark rate that
boosted it to 5.25 percent from 1 percent in 2004.  Bonds (USGG10YR)  tumbled yesterday after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said the central bank may cut the pace of bond purchases at the
next few meetings if policy makers see indications of sustained
growth.  Before closing at the highest yield since March yesterday,
yields earlier dropped as Bernanke referenced the risks
associated with ending easy monetary policy.  “A premature tightening of monetary policy could lead
 interest rates  to rise temporarily but would also carry a
substantial risk of slowing or ending the economic recovery and
causing inflation to fall further,” Bernanke said yesterday in
testimony prepared for a hearing at the Joint Economic Committee
of Congress in  Washington .  Fed Minutes  Minutes of the Fed’s April 30-May 1 policy meeting released
yesterday showed that a “number” of officials were willing to
taper bond buying or quantitative easing as early as the next
meeting in June should economic reports show evidence of strong
and sustained growth.  The market is dealing with “a Fed confusion premium,”
said  Jim Vogel , head of agency-debt research at FTN Financial in
 Memphis ,  Tennessee . “We’ve seen it exercised several different
times, all around the topic of QE.”  Treasuries due in a decade or more are still cheaper
relative to global peers with comparable maturities, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Yields on Treasuries
were 49 basis points higher than those in an index of other
sovereign debt yesterday. As recently as March 25, the gap was
at 57 basis points, the cheapest level since August 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
