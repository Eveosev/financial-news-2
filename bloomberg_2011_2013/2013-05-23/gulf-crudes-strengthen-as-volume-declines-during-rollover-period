Gulf Coast crude oils strengthened on
the  spot market  during the three-day rollover period
characterized by below-normal volume and erratic pricing.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to benchmark West Texas
Intermediate oil strengthened by 35 cents to $8.60 a barrel,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of 2:01 p.m.  New York 
time. Southern Green Canyon gained 40 cents a barrel to a $1.40
premium to WTI, while Poseidon’s premium gained 25 cents to
$3.30. Light Louisiana Sweet oil bucked the trend, weakening 35
cents to $9.25 over WTI.  Spot WTI for delivery at Cushing, Oklahoma, was priced 25
cents below July WTI futures on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . June futures expired May 21. Today is the second of
three days that physical-market traders have to close their
books for the trading month.  In Canada, heavy  oil prices  weakened in out-of-index
trading. Western Canada Select fell 15 cents against WTI to a
$19.75-a-barrel discount, according to Calgary oil broker Net
Energy Inc.  Most of the trading volume for June Canadian crude
shipments occurred from May 1 to May 16, when the average price
for next month’s delivery was set.  To contact the reporter on this story:
