The International Monetary Fund’s
board of directors is backing Managing Director  Christine Lagarde , who is being questioned by a French court over a
decision she made as finance minister, a fund spokesman said.  “The executive board has been briefed on this matter,
including recently, and continues to express its confidence in
the managing director’s ability to effectively carry out her
duties,” IMF spokesman Gerry Rice told reporters at a press
conference in  Washington .  Lagarde, who was finance minister under former President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  and has denied any wrongdoing, arrived for the
questioning in Paris today. The Cour de Justice de la
Republique, which focuses on ministers’ actions in office, is
looking into whether she erred in agreeing to an arbitration to
end a dispute involving business tycoon  Bernard Tapie , an ally
of Sarkozy, that awarded him about $500 million.  Rice also said Lagarde’s immunities were waived “some time
ago” at her request “to the extent necessary to enable her to
appear before the French judicial authorities in this matter.”  Separately, Rice said the fund is still awaiting a revised
economic program from the Egyptian authorities before scheduling
any visit to discuss a loan.  Asked whether the IMF’s preferred creditor status in being
put in question in  Greece , Rice said that such status “is not
under discussion in Greece or anywhere else.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
