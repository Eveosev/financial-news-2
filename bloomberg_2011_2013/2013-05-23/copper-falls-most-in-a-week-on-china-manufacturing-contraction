Copper dropped the most in a week
along with other industrial metals after a report showed
manufacturing in China, the world’s biggest metals consumer, is
contracting for the first time in seven months.  Copper for delivery in three months declined as much as 2.7
percent, the most since May 14, to $7,276.25 a metric ton on the
London Metal Exchange and was at $7,310 at 11:47 a.m. in  Seoul .
The contract for September delivery fell 1.7 percent to 52,690
($8,617)  yuan  a ton in  Shanghai , while futures for July delivery
declined 2 percent to $3.3135 a pound on the Comex.  The preliminary reading of 49.6 for a  Purchasing Managers ’
Index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
compares with a final 50.4 for April. The number was also below
the 50.4 median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 13
analysts. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  “Copper is falling after the worse-than-expected index
along with the strengthening dollar,” said Lelia Kim, a metals
trader at Seoul-based Tong Yang Securities Inc. “Prices could
fall further to $7,200 in the near term.”  Prices also fell after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke yesterday said the central bank could “step down” the
pace of asset purchases in the next few meetings if the labor
market continues to improve and “we have confidence that that
is going to be sustained.”  New rules from  China ’s State Administration of Foreign
Exchange, effective from June, are likely to end commodity-financing deals, according to a report today by Goldman Sachs
Group Ltd. An end to Chinese copper-financing deals would be
bearish for prices, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
