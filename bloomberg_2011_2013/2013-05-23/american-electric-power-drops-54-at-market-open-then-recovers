American Electric Power Co. (AEP) , a
Columbus, Ohio-based utilities company, plunged 54 percent in
the first second of trading before recovering.  American Electric Power fell as much as $26.31 to $22.28 a
share as the market opened today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The shares rebounded, trading down 1.6 percent to
$47.82 as of 10:21 a.m. in New York.  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE) , which
sells electric energy, sank as much as 62 percent to $30.37. The
shares bounced back, with a 1.7 percent loss to $77.85.  The trades weren’t subject to the new system of limiting
swings in individual stocks on American exchanges, a program
known as limit-up/limit-down, because they came before 9:45 a.m.
New York time, before the restrictions begin. The changes are
going into effect gradually for stocks and will be expanded to
the full trading day in August.  Under limit-up/limit-down, trades aren’t allowed to occur
at more-than-specified percentages above or below a stock’s
rolling five-minute average price.  Rich Adamonis , a spokesman for NYSE Euronext, where the
shares are listed, didn’t immediately respond to a phone call
and an e-mail requesting comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
