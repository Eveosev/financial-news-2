The Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc.
is raising the margin requirements for speculators in Japanese
stock futures after prices fell the most in two years.  The initial margin for  Nikkei 225  Stock Average futures
will rise 33 percent to $3,300 per contract at the close of
trading tomorrow, Chicago-based CME Group Inc. said in a
 statement . Initial margin is the minimum amount of cash or
eligible securities investors must deposit to cover the risk of
default.  About  $314 billion  was erased from Japanese market value
today when the Nikkei 225 tumbled 7.3 percent, the most since
March 2011, after a 50 percent surge this year on speculation
that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the  Bank of Japan  would end
two decades of deflation. For the first time since April 2005
every company in the Nikkei 225 fell.  Nikkei 225 futures traded in Osaka were up 0.1 percent in
the May 24 session as of 7:46 a.m. Tokyo time.  The stocks fell as factory output in China shrank for the
first time in seven months, a report from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics showed. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  told lawmakers yesterday a premature withdrawal of
stimulus could endanger economic recovery as policy makers
debated tapering the pace of bond purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
