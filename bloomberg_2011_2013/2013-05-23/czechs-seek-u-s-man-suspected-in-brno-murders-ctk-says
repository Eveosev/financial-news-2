Czech police are looking for a 20-year-old native Californian in connection with the murders of a
family of four in Brno, the country’s second-largest city, state
newswire CTK reported, citing police spokeswoman Petra Vedrova.  The suspect has been working as an English language teacher
and living in the victims’ house for about three weeks,
according to CTK.  The police have asked the public to help locate the man,
who is suspected of being on the run, CTK said. Officials have
also warned that he may be dangerous and is probably armed, the
newswire said.  The suspect may be related to the mother, CTK said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
