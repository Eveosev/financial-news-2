The Australian dollar fell before
U.S. data forecast to show orders for durable goods rose in
April, adding to signs of a sustained recovery in the world’s
largest economy and diminishing the need for monetary stimulus.  The Aussie is set for a third weekly decline amid
speculation a strengthening U.S. economy will prompt the  Federal
Reserve  to pare back on its bond-buying program.  New Zealand ’s
dollar weakened, trimming this week’s advance, after a
government report showed the nation’s trade surplus for April
was less than economists estimated. Both South Pacific nation’s
currencies were lower against the yen as stock declines
worldwide spurred investors to sell higher-yielding assets.  “There’s a lot of negative sentiment around the Aussie,”
said Peter Dragicevich, a Sydney-based currency economist at
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the nation’s largest lender.
“The discussion has shifted toward when will the Fed taper its
asset purchases,” boosting the  U.S. dollar , he said.  The Australian dollar fell 0.6 percent to 96.92 U.S. cents
as of 9:52 a.m. in Sydney after yesterday touching 95.94, the
least since June 1. It fell 0.2 percent to 99.23 yen. The kiwi
declined 0.4 percent to 81.01 U.S. cents and yesterday fell as
low as 80.06, the weakest since Sept. 7. It slid 0.1 percent to
82.94 yen.  For the week, Australia’s currency has weakened 0.4 percent
versus the greenback and the kiwi is up 0.4 percent.  U.S. orders for durable goods climbed 1.5 percent last
month from a revised 6.9 percent drop in March, Commerce
Department data may show today according to economists surveyed
by  Bloomberg News . Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said this week
the central bank may taper monthly bond purchases if it’s
confident of sustained gains in the economy.  New Zealand had a trade surplus of NZ$157 million ($127.1
million) in April, less than the median estimate for a NZ$515
million reading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
