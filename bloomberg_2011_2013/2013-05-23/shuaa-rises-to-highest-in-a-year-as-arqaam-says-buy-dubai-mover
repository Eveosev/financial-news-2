Shuaa Capital PSC (SHUAA)  advanced to the
highest in more than a year after the investment bank controlled
by Dubai’s ruler was raised to buy at Arqaam Capital Ltd.  The shares climbed 3.4 percent to 0.76 dirham, the highest
close since May 8, 2012. About 5.7 million shares traded, or
almost four times the three-month daily average. Shuaa was the
second-biggest mover after Commercial Bank of Dubai on the
emirate’s benchmark DFM General  Index (DFMGI)  in percentage terms. The
measure lost 0.8 percent.  Shuaa, which reported a narrower first-quarter loss, said
in October it plans to boost lending to small- and medium-sized
businesses and high-net-worth individuals. The company completed
a restructuring program to reduce non-core assets, cut jobs and
generate recurring revenue. Shuaa has reported annual losses
since 2008 as the global financial crisis led to a drop in
volumes on local stock markets.  “We upgrade Shuaa to buy, after its successful expansion
in SME lending,”  Jaap Meijer , a director of equity research at
Dubai-based Arqaam Capital, wrote in a report. He also cited the
“reduction in losses from its investment banking platform” as
a reason for raising the stock from hold. Arqaam increased its
share-price estimate to 0.89 dirham.  The shares have jumped 38 percent this year, trailing
Dubai’s benchmark’s 42 percent surge.  Arqaam also raised the price estimate of Commercial Bank of
Dubai to 5.9 dirhams from 5.3 dirhams, according to the report
dated May 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
