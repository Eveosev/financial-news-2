The body of a man thought murdered
dangled from a rope in an attic at the Mariinsky Theater complex
in  St. Petersburg  during a black-tie gala attended by President
 Vladimir Putin  this month.  The body was discovered hanging from a beam in Mariinsky’s
main building on 1 Teatralnaya Ploschad on May 21, five months
after he went missing, the Investigative Committee in  Russia ’s
second-largest city said on its  website .  The man, 22, worked as a roofer at the storied theater
until his disappearance Dec. 5, prompting police to open a probe
into suspected murder, the committee said. Investigators now
believe he committed suicide, according to the statement.  The 230-year-old theater held a three-day celebration this
month to mark the opening of $700 million stage connected to the
main building that cemented its place among the world’s top
cultural institutions.  “It has always been and remains one of the flagships of
Russian culture,” Putin told a champagne-drinking, jewel-wearing crowd May 2 amid scenes from Mozart’s “ Don Giovanni ”
that were performed by Placido Domingo, Russian-born soprano
Anna Netrebko and German bass Rene Pape.  To contact the reporter on this story:
