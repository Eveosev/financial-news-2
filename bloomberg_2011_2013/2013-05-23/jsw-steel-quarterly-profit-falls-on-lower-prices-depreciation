JSW Steel Ltd. (JSTL) ,  India ’s third-biggest
producer of the alloy, reported a 62 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit as prices in the local market fell and
depreciation expenses climbed.  Group net  income , including unit  JSW Ispat Ltd. (JSWI) , fell to
2.96 billion rupees ($53 million) in the three months ended
March 31 from 7.70 billion rupees a year earlier, the Mumbai-based company said today. The median profit estimate of 26
analysts compiled by Bloomberg was 3.78 billion rupees. Sales
dropped 3 percent to 98.5 billion rupees.  Hot-rolled steel coil, a benchmark product used in
automobiles and buildings, declined 10 percent in India
according to Bloomberg calculations based on data from Metal
Bulletin.  JSW Steel  shares  fell as much as 2.9 percent to 665 rupees
and traded at 684.45 rupees as of 2:22 p.m in Mumbai. The stock
has fallen 16 percent this year, compared with a 1.5 percent
gain in the key Sensitive Index.  Depreciation and amortization expenses rose 13 percent to
5.95 billion rupees, according to the statement. Income from
sources other than JSW Steel’s main business fell to 466.1
million rupees from 2.08 billion rupees in the year earlier
period. The drop in profit was partially countered by a fall in
costs of coking coal, a key raw material used in making steel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
