Hong Kong  police arrested a fourth
man in its probe of Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange Ltd., widening
a case begun by the Securities and Futures Commission for
suspected irregularities in financial affairs.  Police arrested a 60-year-old man yesterday, identified
only by his surname Zhu, on suspicion of possession of false
instruments, according to the Police Public Relations Branch.
Three others were arrested the day before in the same probe.  HKMEx surrendered its trading license this month after
failing to attract sufficient trading revenue to support its
operations.  Barry Cheung , the chairman of HKMEx who is a member
of Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying’s Executive
Council, took a leave of absence from his public positions
because of the investigation.  The SFC referred the case to the police’s Commercial Crime
Bureau as it said “the suspected irregularities are serious
ones,” according to a May 21 statement. The three people
arrested earlier aren’t current or former employees of HKMEx,
Cheung said yesterday. He hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
