NKT Holding A/S (NKT)  snapped a two-day
advance in Copenhagen trading after Nordea Bank AB said it’s too
early to buy the stock, arguing the Danish maker of industrial
vacuum cleaners risks losing money on its price strategy.  NKT fell as much as 1.8 percent. The stock declined 1.7
percent to 230.80 kroner at 9:56 a.m. in the Danish capital with
trading volume at 34 percent of the three-month daily average.  NKT, which this year unveiled plans to raise sales prices
for its vacuum cleaners by about 2 percent to cover higher
costs, said yesterday it is encountering delays in implementing
the strategy. Nordea said today price issues for the NKT’s
Nilfisk-Advance unit are “a concern” and repeated a hold
 recommendation  on the stock of the Broendby, Denmark-based
company.  An “unfavorable mix and increased price pressure in
 Europe ” is causing a “weaker gross margin than forecast for
Nilfisk-Advance,” Patrik Setterberg, a Copenhagen-based analyst
with Nordea, said in a note to clients.  Setterberg said yesterday’s first-quarter earnings
statement, in which NKT reported net income that  missed  analyst
estimates, was “a mixed bag.” Earnings progress for NKT’s
other unit, a cable division, is surrounded by “uncertainty,”
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
