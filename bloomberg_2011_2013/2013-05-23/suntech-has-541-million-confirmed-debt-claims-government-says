The restructuring administrator of
 Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) ’s Wuxi unit, which was forced into
bankruptcy in March, has confirmed 3.32 billion yuan ($541
million) of debt claims, the Wuxi city government said.  Administrators have reviewed 300 out of 529 debt claims as
of May 20, the Wuxi city government said in a  statement .  Suntech, once the top solar-panel manufacturer, may become
the largest renewable-energy insolvency after its main
manufacturing unit was pulled into bankruptcy by Chinese banks
on March 20 following a default on a $541 million bond
repayment. The eastern Chinese city is considering how to
restructure Wuxi Suntech’s debts.  The Wuxi Municipal Intermediate People’s Court held its
first meeting with Suntech creditors yesterday afternoon, the
statement said. Creditors have claimed a total of 17.4 billion
 yuan  of debts owed by Wuxi Suntech, the Economic Observer
 reported  on its website late yesterday, citing an unidentified
person at the debt restructuring committee.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
