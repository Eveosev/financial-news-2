Steel reinforcement-bar futures
declined after data showed an unexpected contraction in  China ’s
manufacturing this month, hurting the outlook for bulk
commodities.  Rebar for delivery in October dropped as much as 1.2
percent to 3,551  yuan  ($579) a metric ton on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange and traded at 3,565 yuan at 10:49 a.m. local
time. The price has lost 11 percent this year.  Manufacturing in the second-largest economy is shrinking
for the first time in seven months, adding to signs that growth
is losing steam for a second quarter. The preliminary reading of
49.6 for the  Purchasing Managers ’ Index from HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics compares with a final 50.4 for April and
50.4 median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 13 analysts.  “The surprisingly weak PMI release today is deemed bearish
for all industrial commodities,” Ren Xinlei, analyst at Luzheng
Futures Co., said by phone from Qingdao. Industrial metals
including copper declined on the London Metal Exchange.  A drop in  iron ore  also weighed down rebar, according to
Ren. Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to Tianjin port
fell 0.3 percent to $123.20 a dry ton yesterday, according to
The Steel Index Ltd. data. The price touched $123 on May 20, the
lowest since Dec. 7.  The average  spot price  for rebar was little changed at
3,550 yuan a ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
