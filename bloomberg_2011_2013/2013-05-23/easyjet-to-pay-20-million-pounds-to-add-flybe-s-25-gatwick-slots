EasyJet Plc (EZJ) , Europe’s second biggest
discount carrier, said it agreed to buy 25 pairs of take-off and
landing slots at  London ’s Gatwick airport for 20 million pounds
($25.7 million) from  Flybe Group Plc. (FLYB)   The slots at the discount carrier’s largest base will allow
EasyJet to boost frequencies on existing routes and add
destinations, the Luton, England-based company said in a
statement today. The transfer will take effect in mid 2014.  Flybe, Europe’s biggest regional airline, said  this month
that it was in talks to sell all its slots at Gatwick as part of
a cost-cutting plan aimed at returning the carrier to profit.
The airline’s pilots agreed May 3 to a 5 percent reduction in
pay to avoid job losses. Its regional focus means Flybe has
higher unit costs than discount carriers like EasyJet.  “This looks a sensible deal,” Investec analyst James Hollins said in a note to investors today. “This will enhance
EasyJet’s share dominance at Gatwick where we estimate the group
has a greater than 40 percent market share currently.”  The exchange is subject the approval of the International
Air Transport Association, as well as acceptance by shareholders
expected in July, Flybe said in a separate statement. The
airline flew 550,000 passengers from Gatwick in the year ending
March 31 and today operates seven routes in and out of the
airport.  Flybe also said that it has agreed with  Embraer SA (EMBR3)  to defer
16 E175 aircraft due in 2014 and 2015, and the models will not
be delivered until 2017 to 2019, helping the carrier cut pre-delivery payment by 20 million pounds during the winter season
of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
