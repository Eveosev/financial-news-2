India ’s rupee fell to a six-month low
and bonds dropped after the Federal Reserve flagged the
possibility of trimming its debt purchases, raising concern
inflows to higher-yielding emerging-market assets will slow.  The currency declined for a sixth day, the longest losing
streak since December 2011, as Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
yesterday the central bank may taper its $85 billion a month of
securities purchases if it sees clear signs of a sustained
improvement in the economy. Overseas investors have poured a net
$14.2 billion into Indian shares this year, the most in Asia
after  Japan , helping fund a record current-account deficit.  “There’s concern portfolio capital flows may drop if the
Fed scales back stimulus,” said Shubhada Rao, chief economist
at Yes Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “Sustained inflows are crucial for
supporting the rupee given the current-account shortfall.”  The rupee weakened 0.6 percent to 55.8100 per dollar as of
10:11 a.m. in Mumbai and reached 55.8787, the lowest level since
Nov. 26, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the exchange
rate used to price options, rose 16 basis points, or 0.16
percentage point, to 8.63 percent.  The yield on the 8.15 percent government bonds June 2022
climbed five basis points to 7.41 percent in Mumbai. Today’s
move is 20 times the average of the past three months, the most
among 22  emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg.  Current Account  The nation’s sovereign debt has returned 7.5 percent this
year, the second-best performance among 10 Asian indexes
compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc, after the  Philippines .  The Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council estimates
the current-account deficit widened to 5.1 percent of gross
domestic product in the year ended March 31, compared with 4.2
percent in the previous 12 months. The currency dropped 2.4
percent this quarter, after gaining 1.3 percent in the prior
three months.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 56.80 per
dollar, compared with 56.53 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 56.76 versus 56.46. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
