The Nazi party had a strong following
in  Austria ’s central bank years before the Alpine nation was
annexed by  Adolf Hitler ’s  Germany , a historical review found.  Out of 800 employees, 120 probably were party members
before 1938, according to the report released today by the
central bank, 75 years after Austria’s annexation by Germany.
The members were part of a Nazi operating cell set up in 1930
that remained active from 1933, when the party was banned in
Austria, to 1938, the report said.  “The factory cell was popular for many reasons, above all
the virtual collapse of the Austrian economy toward the end of
the 1920s” and public-sector austerity measures, the authors of
the  report , Oliver Rathkolb and Theodor Venus, wrote. While
socialist trade unions had a strong base at private banks,
right-wing German national recruitment networks were more
effective at the central bank, they said.  The study, commissioned by the central bank in 2010, is the
first to show the history of the institution during the Nazi era
in detail. Rathkolb, a history professor at the  University of
Vienna , earlier this year published a report about the Vienna
Philharmonic’s Nazi past.  By 1944, 331 central bank employees had joined the Nazi
party. From 1933, after the party was banned, 35 percent of top-level employees were members of the National Socialist German
Worker’s Party, the researchers found.  Dismissals  After Germany’s Reichsbank took control of the Austrian
central bank and seized the bank’s gold and foreign currency
reserves, 26 employees were dismissed and another 54 were were
sent into retirement, the study found. Then-director general
Franz Bartsch was sent to the Dachau concentration camp, from
which he was released the same year. Several other officials,
including Eugen Kaniak, Franz Stoeger-Marenpach, and Wilhelm
Tomaschek were also interned in concentration camps.  Two Jewish women who left the bank in 1938 and 1939 died in
concentration camps. Hilda Schafranek, who worked in the foreign
exchange unit, was deported to Theresienstadt in the former
 Czechoslovakia  in 1943 and died in Auschwitz in 1944, according
to the report. Karoline Winkler, who worked in the cashier’s
department, died in Theresienstadt in 1943.  In 1946, about 200 employees, or 35 percent of total staff
of the former Reichsbank office in Vienna, were dismissed at
least temporarily pending denazification measures, according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
