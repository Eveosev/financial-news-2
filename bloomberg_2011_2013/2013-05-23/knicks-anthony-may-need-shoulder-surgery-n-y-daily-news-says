Carmelo Anthony, the  New York  Knicks’
leading scorer, may need surgery to repair his left shoulder,
the New York Daily News reported, citing a person familiar with
the player’s medical condition.  Anthony, who played 12 National Basketball Association
playoff games with a partially torn labrum, will rest for four
weeks before being re-evaluated for surgery, the Daily News
said.  Anthony has complained of pain in his shoulder since April
14 when the Knicks played the  Indiana Pacers  in the regular
season. He re-injured it in Game 5 against the  Boston Celtics  in
the playoffs, the newspaper said.  If surgery is needed, Anthony would require as long as five
months to recover, which could interfere with the start of
training camp in October, the Daily News said.  Anthony averaged an NBA-high 28.7 points per game, as well
as 6.9 rebounds and 2.6 assists during the regular season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
