Herakles Farms needs to obtain the
correct permits before it can proceed with its plans to develop
an oil palm plantation and processing plant in southwest
Cameroon, the government said.  The New York-based company needs a Public Utility
Declaration Certificate and another certificate showing
effective transfer of the plantation land before proceeding with
its activity, the Ministry of Forestry and Wildlife said in a
statement yesterday.  On May 18 Herakles said it suspended work in Cameroon and
furloughed its 690 workers there after being ordered to halt
operations by the government.  A Sept. 17, 2009 agreement between government and Herakles’
subsidiary Sithe Global Sustainable Oils Cameroon for the
development of a plantation on 73,086 hectares (180,595 acres)
of land doesn’t “exempt” the company from respecting “legal
procedure and environmental constraints,”  Forestry Minister
Ngole Philip Ngwesse said in the statement.  The Minister of Forestry and Wildlife authorized the
clearing of the forest around the plantation within an area of
2,500 hectares close to the village of Talangaye but following
complaints from the local community, the minister was obliged to
act, the ministry said in the statement.  Herakles  has obtained all necessary permissions, it said
in its statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
