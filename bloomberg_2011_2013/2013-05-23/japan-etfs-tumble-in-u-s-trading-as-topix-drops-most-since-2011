Japanese exchange-traded funds, the
most popular ETFs in the world this year, fell in U.S. trading
as the Topix index posted the biggest drop since the aftermath
of the March 2011 tsunami and nuclear disaster.  The  iShares MSCI Japan Index Fund , the largest U.S. ETF of
Japanese shares, slid 4.2 percent to $11.62 in New York for the
biggest drop since 2011. The WisdomTree  Japan  Hedged Equity
Fund, which saw assets rise sevenfold this year, sank 4.3
percent to $50.36. Both have received more cash than any other
ETF in 2013. The Bank of New York Mellon Japan ADR Index fell as
much as 7.2 percent for the worst drop since 2008.  “Everybody’s concerned about the market being overvalued
and Japan in particular has had massive positive returns,” Greg Peterson, director of investment research at Ballentine Partners
LLC in Waltham,  Massachusetts , which manages about $4 billion,
said by telephone. “People are ready to pull the trigger at any
sign that any thing’s going wrong.”  About $314 billion was erased from Japanese market value
today when the Topix tumbled 6.9 percent after a 48 percent
surge this year on speculation that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
and the Bank of Japan would end two decades of deflation. For
the first time since April 2005 every company in the Nikkei 225
Stock Average fell, dragging the gauge down 7.3 percent.  Nikkei 225 futures traded in  Osaka  were up 0.1 percent in
the May 24 session. The yen strengthened against its 16 major
peers, gaining 0.1 percent to 101.97 per dollar.  Stimulus Withdrawal  Factory output in  China  shrank for the first time in seven
months, a report from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
showed. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told lawmakers yesterday a
premature withdrawal of stimulus could endanger economic
recovery as policy makers debated tapering the pace of bond
purchases.  About 146 million shares of the iShares MSCI Japan changed
hands today, the highest since April 11, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Toyota Motor Corp.’s American depositary receipts slid 2.5
percent to $124.66. Honda Motor Co. ADRs lost 2.5 percent to
$40.24 and those for Sony Corp. fell 2.4 percent to $21.63.  To contact the reporter on this story:
