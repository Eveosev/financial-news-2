State Bank of India , the nation’s
largest lender by assets, posted a 19 percent decline in fourth-quarter profit, missing analysts’ estimates, as provisions for
bad debt climbed.  Net income  fell to 33 billion rupees ($591 million), or
49.13 rupees a share, for the three months ended March 31, from
a record 40.5 billion rupees, or 63.76 rupees, a year earlier,
the Mumbai-based lender said in an exchange filing today. The
figure, reported on a standalone basis, missed the 37.2 billion-rupee median of 42 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Provisions for bad loans and a drop in borrowing costs as
the central bank cuts interest rates may erode the lender’s
earnings as  Asia ’s third-largest economy grapples with a decade-low pace of growth, said Nitin Kumar, a Mumbai-based analyst at
Quant Broking Ltd. SBI reduced its  base rate , the minimum at
which it lends, twice in the last nine months.  “Narrowing margins and higher provisions for bad loans may
put further pressure on the lender’s profitability,” Kumar said
by phone before the earnings were announced. “It is a tough
task to cut bad loans in the current economic environment.”  Provisions for nonperforming assets rose to 39.7 billion
rupees from 28.4 billion rupees a year earlier, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
