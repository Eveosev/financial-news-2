Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) 
Chief Executive Officer Herbert Stepic is being probed by the
company’s compliance department after press reports showed he
used an offshore account to manage real estate investments.  Stepic employed  UBS AG (UBSN)  to set up the account, which was
used to buy and manage properties in  Singapore , the CEO told
Vienna’s News magazine in an interview published today.
Raiffeisen spokesman Michael Palzer confirmed the comments.  “Internal compliance has been instructed to consider this
information and to determine whether it meets with relevant
regulations and internal rules,” Palzer said from Vienna.
“Once this analysis is complete, the competent bodies will
evaluate the result and then draw the necessary conclusions.”  The probe doesn’t come as the first into Stepic’s
investments. Austria’s financial regulator, the FMA, ended an
investigation into the CEO’s land deals in  Serbia  this week
after Stepic showed he had already exited the investment. In
April, he returned 2 million euros ($2.6 million) to the bank
after his 2012 salary swelled despite falling profit and job
cuts.  The FMA has asked Stepic for more details about the
offshore accounts and his investments, spokesman Klaus Grubelnik
in Vienna said today via telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
