A summary of two reports on Cyprus’s
track record in combating money laundering doesn’t reflect the
main findings of the reports and only gives a description of
perceived weaknesses, the Central Bank of Cyprus said.  “The failure to refer to any of the positive aspects
mentioned has resulted in erroneous and distorted conclusions,”
the Nicosia-based bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  In contrast to the summary, the reports by Deloitte
Financial Advisory Srl and  Moneyval , the Council of Europe’s
money-laundering watchdog, indicate that “anti-money laundering
preventative measures and procedures in banks are generally
sound” and “generally the banks have a high level of
compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements, which
in some areas are more demanding than European Union and
international requirements,” the central bank said.  An audit of Cyprus’s attempts to prevent money laundering,
required as part of a 10 billion-euro ($12.9 billion)
international rescue, showed “systemic deficiencies in the
implementation of preventative measures by the audited
institutions,” according to a summary of a report by Deloitte’s
Italian unit distributed to reporters in Helsinki on May 15.  “There is no reference to, or indication of systemic
deficiencies” in the reports as a whole and “the general
picture portrayed is not negative,” the central bank said.
Cypriot authorities are in the process of providing a detailed
response to the International Monetary Fund, the European
Commission, the European Central Bank as well as to euro-area
finance ministers, it said.  Deloitte’s report found that only four of 27 areas
concerning customer due diligence needed further attention while
only 29 of over 570,000 transactions analyzed warranted further
investigation by the bank, according to the statement. Moneyval
established that there was nothing unique to Cyprus in the way
international banking business is conducted, the central bank
said.  Countries including  Germany  had insisted that  Russia  carry
some of the cost of rescuing Cyprus, alleging that Russian
businesses were using the island to launder money.  To contact the reporter on this story:
