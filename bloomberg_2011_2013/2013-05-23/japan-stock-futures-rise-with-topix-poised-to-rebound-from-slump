Japanese stock futures rose,
indicating the market may rebound from yesterday’s rout that
erased $314 billion in market value during the biggest drop in
the country’s shares since the 2011 earthquake.  American Depositary Receipts of Honda Motor Co. advanced
1.8 percent from the close in  Tokyo  after yesterday’s 5.2
percent drop. ADRs of  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker, added 1.7
percent after a 3.9 percent loss. Shares of  SoftBank Corp. (9984) ,
 Japan ’s third-largest wireless carrier, may be active after
saying it will let the U.S. government have veto power over one
nominee to Sprint Nextel Corp.’s board to ease security concerns
if its $20.1 billion takeover bid succeeds.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring next
month traded at 14,800 at the close in Chicago yesterday, up
from 14,590 at the close in  Osaka , Japan. They were bid in the
pre-market at 14,730 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures
on  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index advanced 0.3 percent and New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.2 percent.  “While no small matter, Thursday’s stomach-turning
correction in Japan and Asia ultimately strikes us mostly as a
mere step-back on a continuing upward path for Japanese and
Asia-Pacific equities,” said Michael Kurtz, Hong Kong-based
head of global equity strategy at Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan’s
largest brokerage. There has been no “fundamental impairment of
Japan’s medium-term growth and equity-return prospects.”  Hong Kong  Futures on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index and contracts on the
Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies trading
in Hong Kong both retreated 0.2 percent. The Bloomberg China-US
Equity Index of the most-traded Chinese shares in the U.S.
dropped 1.3 percent in New York yesterday.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 plunged 7.3 percent yesterday and the
Topix Index slumped 6.9 percent, their biggest daily drops since
March 15, 2011, in the immediate aftermath of Japan’s earthquake
and tsunami. Financial companies led the decline as every stock
in the Nikkei 225 retreated for the first since April 2005.  Both gauges were up almost 40 percent this year through
yesterday as the Bank of Japan stepped up efforts to end
deflation. Gains for the Topix remain more than twice as big as
in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index this year even after the
drop.  The  Chicago  Mercantile Exchange Inc. is raising the margin
requirements for speculators in Japanese stock futures after
prices fell the most in two years. The initial margin for Nikkei
225 Stock Average futures will rise 33 percent to $3,300 per
contract at the close of trading today, Chicago-based CME Group
Inc. said in a statement. Initial margin is the minimum amount
of cash or eligible securities investors must deposit to cover
the risk of default.  Relative Value  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, has gained 7.2 percent this year through
yesterday, leaving the measure trading at 13.7 times average
estimated earnings compared with 15 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 13.4 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rose 0.1
percent. The gauge yesterday fell 0.3 percent, giving the index
its first back-to-back drop in one month, as a contraction in
China manufacturing offset American housing data and investors
weighed Federal Reserve stimulus comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
