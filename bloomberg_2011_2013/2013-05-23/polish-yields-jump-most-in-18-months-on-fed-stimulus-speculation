The yield on Poland’s 10-year
government bonds  soared  18 basis points, the biggest daily
increase since November 2011, on growing concern the  Federal
Reserve  will taper its stimulus program.  The yield on the benchmark notes due in October 2023 surged
to a one-month high of 3.48 percent at 6:21 p.m. in Warsaw. The
rate on the bond has increased 41 basis points, or 0.41
percentage point, since hitting a record-low on May 9. The zloty
weakened 0.3 percent to 4.1977 per euro, declining for a second
straight day to the lowest level since April 4.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S. central bank may
cut the pace of bond purchases at the next few meetings if
policy makers see indications of sustained growth. Such a move
would curb liquidity flows which have boosted emerging-market
assets, including Polish debt, in past months. Minutes of the
Fed’s April 30-May 1 meeting released yesterday showed that a
“number” of policy makers were willing to taper bond buying
from the $85 billion a month pace if the economy improved.  “This is a huge sell-off, which may be continued,” Lukasz Witkowski, who manages the equivalent of $1.1 billion in bonds
at mutual fund PKO TFI SA in Warsaw, said by phone today.
“Bernanke and Fed minutes were the trigger,” he said.  Poland ’s statistics office will release April retail sales
and unemployment rate data at 10 a.m. in Warsaw tomorrow. Retail
sales grew 1.1 percent from last year and the jobless rate fell
to 13.9 percent from 14.3 percent in March, according to median
forecasts from Bloomberg surveys.  To contact the reporter on this story:
