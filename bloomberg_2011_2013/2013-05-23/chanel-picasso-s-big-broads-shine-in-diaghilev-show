A security guard in the art gallery burst into dance, suddenly leaping and turning. I was surprised, but his compulsion was completely understandable.  The scene was a partial recreation of the stage set for Serge Diaghilev’s 1924 ballet “The Blue Train.”  It had walls painted like a Mediterranean coastline, original Coco Chanel costumes and Picasso’s 39-foot-wide stage cloth depicting two enormous women running hand-in-hand like lovers along the beach.  It’s the penultimate gallery in “Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes 1909-1929: When Art Danced with Music.” This exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in  Washington  D.C. features ballet film footage, paintings, drawings, prints, posters, photographs, sculptures, sets, costumes and music.  It is pure enchantment. You do not simply move through this show -- you descend ever-deeper into its storybook magic.  Installed chronologically, it follows the 20-year-reign of Russian impresario Diaghilev’s revolutionary Ballets Russes.  He mined the talents of Leon Bakst, Balanchine, Cocteau, Debussy, Robert and Sonia Delaunay, Michel Fokine, Natalia Goncharova, Matisse, Rouault and Stravinsky.  Any one ballet, player, artist or designer here is worthy of an entire exhibition. What we get instead is a fluid dreamscape that combines Russian folktales, classical mythology and Cubist geometries with gods, fauns, nymphs, harlequins, princes and sea creatures.  Magical Firebird  Though the tone changes from ballet to ballet, the entire show feels moonlit. The buffoonery of “Chout” is subsumed by the heat of “Firebird,” which is then submerged by the underwater world of “Sadko.”  In a section devoted to Nijinsky, and especially “The Spirit of the Rose,” we see his flower-petal costume and Rodin’s bronze portrait of the dancer: He’s wound up as taut as a cobra ready to strike.  While watching the ballet, Renoir observed that Nijinsky leaped across the stage “like a panther.” Don’t be surprised if this otherworldly exhibition inspires you to do the same.  “Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes 1909-1929: When Art Danced with Music” runs through Sept. 2 at the National Gallery of Art, 6th Street and Constitution Avenue, Washington, D.C.

I loved reuniting with old friends like Renoir’s “Luncheon of the Boating Party,”  Paul Klee ’s “Picture Album” and Chardin’s “A Bowl of Plumbs,” but among the installations of contemporary art, I almost didn’t recognize the place.  With varying success, the Phillips -- America’s first museum of Modern art -- is reassessing its place in a postmodern world.  Artworks have been moved around, changed out and spiced up. In the misguided “Intersections” exhibition “Vanitas!,” Jeanne Silverthorne’s cumbersome rubber sculptures were interspersed with still life paintings in the permanent collection.  The spice is literal. A room was given over permanently to Wolfgang Laib, who has lined it with about 440 pounds of golden beeswax. Its pungent fragrance can make you dizzy two galleries away.  The thrilling, compact exhibition of sculpture and drawings, “Giorgio de Chirico: Myth and Archaeology,” felt right at home.  In De Chirico’s bronze sculptures, archaeologists were conflated with ruins, Orpheus became his lyre and architectural muses were transformed into classical temples.  My only regret was that De Chirico’s works hugged the staircase. But that at least is in keeping with the spirit of the Phillips.  “Intersections: Jeanne Silverthorne Vanitas!” runs through June 2 and “Giorgio de Chirico: Myth and Archaeology” runs through June 15 at the Phillips Collection, 1600 21st St., NW, Washington, D.C.
