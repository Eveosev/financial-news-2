Ivory Coast ’s electricity monopoly,
which has a stock that’s soared 95 percent in the past year,
will increase exports as rising domestic demand boosts profit
amid an economic recovery in the world’s biggest cocoa producer.  Ivory Coast’s capacity is 1,421 megawatts, which will rise
by 100 megawatts by the end of the month when Glasgow-based
 Aggreko Plc (AGK) ’s power plant in Abidjan boosts capacity, Stephan
Dauriac,  Cie Ivoirienne d’Electricite ’s deputy director-general
in charge of finance management and logistics, said in an e-mailed response to questions yesterday. Ivory Coast’s neighbor,
Ghana, has capacity of about 2,500 megawatts and  Nigeria ,
Africa’s biggest oil producer, generates about 4,000 megawatts.  Ivory Coast is planning to spend $4 billion over the next
six years in energy infrastructure to boost electricity output
by 1,100 megawatts, Mining and Energy Minister Adama Toungara
said in November. The expansion comes as the country recovers
from a five-month crisis sparked by a disputed election in late
November 2010. CIE’s profit rose 32 percent to 8.39 billion  CFA
francs  ($16 million) in 2012, it said last month.  After contracting 4.7 percent in 2011, Ivory Coast’s
economy grew 9.8 percent last year. The government forecasts
expansion of 9 percent this year and above 10 percent by 2014.  “With economic growth on the rise and strong economic
prospects, household consumption should grow as people will use
more household goods,” Dauriac said.  Mining Demand  Paris-based Finagestion SA, a holding company that’s 60
percent controlled by U.S. private-equity investor Emerging
Capital Partners LLC, holds 54 percent of CIE while the Ivorian
government has a 15 percent stake, according to its website. The
shares were unchanged at 43,000 francs on the Bourse Regionale
des Valeurs Mobilieres at the close yesterday in Abidjan. The
BRVM’s composite  index  has gained 39 percent in the past year.  Ivory Coast exports an average of 73 megawatts, or 645
annual gigawatt hours, to neighboring countries including  Mali ,
 Burkina Faso , Ghana, Togo and  Benin , he said. The figure will
rise to 1,000 gigawatt hours this year and 2,000 gigawatt hours
by 2016-17, Dauriac said. Guinea,  Sierra Leone  and Liberia have
asked for electricity from the biggest economy in the eight-member Economic and Monetary Union of West Africa. One megawatt
is enough to power 500 to 1,000 U.S. homes.  South Africa  has
generating capacity of 41,000 megawatts.  Demand for energy is rising in Ivory Coast’s mining,
infrastructure and agricultural processing industries, Dauriac
said.  Randgold Resources Inc. (RRS)  opened its Tongon gold mine in
October 2011 in northern Ivory Coast, where CIE cut back
operations following a 2002 army mutiny that split the country
between a government-controlled south and rebel-held north.  CIE, which got just 15 percent of its bills paid in the
north from 2002 to 2011, is in talks with the government for the
money owed, Dauriac said. The company now has a collection rate
of about 50 percent in the region, which is still not enough to
make operations there profitable, he said. CIE has 190,000
customers in the north and 1.15 million nationwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
