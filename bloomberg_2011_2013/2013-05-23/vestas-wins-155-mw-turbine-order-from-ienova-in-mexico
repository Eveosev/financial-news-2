Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the wind-turbine maker with the highest installed capacity, won a 155-megawatt order from Infraestructura Energetica Nova SAB, the
Mexican unit of U.S. natural-gas utility  Sempra Energy. (SRE)   The order is for 47 V112 3.3-megawatt machines, new
variants that are 10 percent more powerful than the standard
model, Aarhus, Denmark-based Vestas said today in an e-mailed
statement. Theyâ€™ll be installed at the Energia Sierra Juarez
wind power plant in Baja California, with first deliveries due
in the third quarter of next year, Vestas said. The plant is due
to be commissioned in the first quarter of 2015, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
