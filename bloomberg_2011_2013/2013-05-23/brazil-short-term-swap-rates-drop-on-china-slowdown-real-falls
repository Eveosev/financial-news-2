Brazil ’s shorter-term swap rates fell
as manufacturing in  China , the South American country’s biggest
trading partner, slowed, fueling speculation policy makers will
limit increases in borrowing costs.  Swap rates on the contract due in January fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.11 percent at 9:42 a.m.
in Sao Paulo. The real declined 0.2 percent to 2.0543 per
dollar, its lowest level on a closing basis since Dec. 24.  China’s manufacturing is contracting for the first time in
seven months in May, adding to signs growth in the world’s
biggest emerging-market economy is losing steam. Brazilian
policy makers raised the target lending rate last month by a
quarter-percentage point to 7.50 percent to curb inflation. The
central bank’s next rate-setting meeting is scheduled for May
28-29.  To contact the reporters on this story:
