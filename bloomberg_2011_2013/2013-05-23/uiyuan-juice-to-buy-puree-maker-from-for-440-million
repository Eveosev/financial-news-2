China Huiyuan Juice Group Ltd. (1886) , the
nation’s biggest juice maker by market share, said it will buy a
concentrates-and-puree maker from its chairman for HK$3.42
billion ($440 million) in new stock.  Huiyuan will issue 447.3 million new common shares and
655.3 million in new convertible preferred shares to a company
owned by Chairman Zhu Xinli, according to a  Hong Kong  stock
exchange filing yesterday.  The Beijing-based juice maker said it will also assume
HK$1.52 billion of debt. Huiyuan fell 4.3 percent, the biggest
drop in more than a month, to close at HK$3.13 in Hong Kong
today.  “The stock dropped as investors are worried about its
rising debt level,” Todd Yang, an analyst at Guosen Securities
(HK) Brokerage Co., said by phone. Huiyuan had net debt of 3.2
billion  yuan  ($522 million) as of December, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Huiyuan, which says it holds 54 percent of  China ’s 100
percent juice market, has attributed a decline in earnings to
pressure from China’s slowing economy and consumer concerns
about food-safety issues. Last year profit sank 95 percent to
16.2 million yuan, the company said in March.  The target company China Huiyuan Industry Holding Ltd. had
profit of 358 million yuan last year and 275 million yuan in
2011, according to the filing.  “In the mid to long term, the business should improve from
this deal,” Yang said.  The purchase “secures long-term access to key raw
materials,” Huiyuan said in yesterday’s filing. It also boosts
quality control and helps diversify revenue and profits, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
