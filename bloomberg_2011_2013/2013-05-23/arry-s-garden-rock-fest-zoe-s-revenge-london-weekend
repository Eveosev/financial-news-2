Prince Harry’s flowers, a play about infidelity, a new City restaurant and some garden sheds turned into artworks are among Muse’s arts and leisure recommendations for  London  this weekend.  STAGE  Zoe Wanamaker is drawing rave reviews for her role as a wife who has to bring her cheating husband back into line.  She stars in Peter Nichols’s “Passion Play” with Owen Teale as her adulterous husband. The Duke of York’s Theatre comedy gets unexpected twists as she plans revenge. Then both characters get alter-ego roles who express their real thoughts.  http://www.atgtickets.com  or +44-844-871-7615.  It’s your last chance to catch Terence Rattigan’s 1946 hit “The Winslow Boy,” based on a real Edwardian legal battle. The curtain comes down Saturday on the current staging, which has fine performances from Charlie Rowe and Peter Sullivan.

This Covent Garden restaurant dates back to 1991. It’s housed in a 19th-century casino and is known for its burgers, martinis and brunch.

The restaurant now has a new outpost near the City financial district. Chabrot Bistrot des Halles, at Smithfield, is open for dinner on Saturdays, serving dishes such as warm duck-liver pate, Comte cheese choux pastry, and confit duck leg with green bean salad.

She’s now done the same to three disused wooden sheds bought on e-Bay; they’re on display at the Gagosian in a show ending tomorrow. You can still see the keyholes and the slots from which garden tools once hung.  In the adjacent room are candy-colored resin casts of age-old doors and windows; they too bear traces of past lives.  To see Whiteread’s more classically attractive recent work, head for the  Whitechapel Gallery  and admire her gold-leaf frieze on the facade.  Ends May 25 at the  Gagosian Gallery , Britannia Street, WC1X 9JD:  http://www.gagosian.com  or +44-207-841-9960.  MUSIC  The Field Day festival in  Victoria Park , now in its seventh year, has one of its most eclectic line-ups, ranging from poet John Cooper Clarke to pop from Bat for Lashes. The May 25 bill also includes indie rockers Django Django and Everything Everything, two bands who have in common both the repetitive names and explosive guitar sound.  Victoria Park, E3 5SN.  http://www.fielddayfestivals.com ,  http://towerhamlets.gov.uk/victoriapark , +44-20-7364-7905.  The English National Opera has a hit on its hands with Carrie Cracknell’s production of Alban Berg’s “Wozzeck.” Leigh Melrose is superb in the title role as a downtrodden ex-soldier, matched by James Morris as a corrupt doctor.

The prince commissioned a display garden for the  Sentebale  charity (based in southern  Africa ) which he co-founded in memory of his late mother Diana. The display features plants from  Lesotho , and evokes the country’s mountains and circular homes.  Visitors may buy plants from some of the displays as the event ends on May 25.
