Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand signed a one-year extension to his contract after the
team won its 20th English league title.  The 34-year-old has been with United for 11 years, winning
six Premier League championships.  Ferdinand, who’s made 432 appearances for the club, last
week ended his career with the English national team to focus
on playing for United, where  David Moyes  is succeeding  Alex Ferguson  as manager.  “I am delighted to have signed a new contract,” Ferdinand
said on  United’s website . “Who wouldn’t want to play in this
fantastic team in front of 76,000 fans each week? It has been an
incredible journey and I am glad it will continue. We are now
moving into a new era with the club which is very exciting. I
have met with David. I am really looking forward to working with
him.”  Moyes said Ferdinand has just had one of his best seasons
with United.  “Even from the outside you can see what a big character
Rio is around the dressing room, so I am delighted he has signed
a new contract,” he said.  Ferdinand previously played for West Ham and Leeds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
