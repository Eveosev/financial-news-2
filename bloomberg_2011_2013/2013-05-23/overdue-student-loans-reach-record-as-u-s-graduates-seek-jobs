Overdue  student loans  reached an all-time high as students struggle to find work after college,
according to a government report renewing alarms about the
rising burden of higher-education debt.  Eleven percent of student loans were seriously delinquent
-- at least 90 days past due -- in the third quarter of 2012,
compared with 6 percent in the first quarter of 2003, according
to the report by the U.S.  Education Department . Almost 30
percent of 20- to 24-year-olds aren’t employed or in school, the
study found.  The research is being released amid concern in Congress and
President  Barack Obama ’s administration about rising college
costs and $1 trillion in outstanding student loans, the largest
category of  consumer debt  besides mortgages. Borrowers say the
burden is affecting their choice of jobs and their ability to
buy homes and get married.  “Today’s economy puts young graduates in a difficult
position,” Jack Buckley, commissioner of the National Center
for Education Statistics, which published the report, said in a
statement. “A college diploma no longer guarantees a direct
pathway to the middle class, making it harder to justify the
expense of a degree.”  Still, college graduates have an edge in the job market,
showing the need for higher education, Buckley said. The
employment rate for young adults who are college graduates is 87
percent, compared with 64 percent for those with only a high-school diploma, the report found.  To contact the reporter on this story:
