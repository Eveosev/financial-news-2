Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  will introduce its
first Datsun model in  India  by March 2014 as the Japanese
carmaker offers cheaper vehicles in a push for a fivefold
increase in its share of Asia’s third-biggest auto market.  Nissan plans initially to sell Datsun-brand cars at
existing Indian dealerships, Kenichiro Yomura, head of its local
unit, told journalists in Mumbai yesterday. Nissan is expanding
its network in the country to 145 outlets by then from 95
currently, he said.  Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn revived the brand,
phased out in 1981, to widen Yokohama-based Nissan’s appeal to
customers in countries such as India,  Russia  and  Indonesia . In
India, Datsun will compete against local market leader  Maruti
Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL)  and Seoul-based  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  as Nissan
targets a 10 percent market share by 2016.  “It’s going to be a challenge for Datsun” as Nissan uses
the division to bring out entry-level models that can be priced
lower than its current cars, said Ammar Master, an analyst at
LMC Automotive in Bangkok. “It will take some time for Datsun
to build up its brand name” and win drivers away from larger
manufacturers.  Nissan plans to almost triple sales in India to 100,000
vehicles in the year through March 2014, Yomura said. That would
outpace the industrywide gain of as much as 7 percent projected
by the  Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers .  “We know that the competition like Hyundai and Suzuki are
strong, but nobody can dominate the market indefinitely,” said
Yomura, who moved to India from the Middle East two months ago.
“Datsun is not a cheaper version of Nissan. It’s a real car
built specifically for customers in India.”  Micra Compact  Nissan needs to gain sales in smaller models to achieve its
market-share target. Compacts and minicars accounted for about
75 percent of passenger-car deliveries in India in the year
ended March 31, according to the auto manufacturers’
association. Maruti controlled 45 percent of the car market,
while Hyundai held 20 percent, according to the group. Nissan’s
French partner,  Renault SA (RNO) , ranked ninth in passenger-vehicle
sales, which also include vans and utility vehicles, and the
Japanese company was No. 10.  “It is an intelligent strategy not to be bogged down and
to be able to position its vehicles lower than it would under
the Renault or Nissan brand names,” LMC Automotive’s Master
said. “It will be very important to Renault-Nissan to succeed
as that will bring in entry level buyers that will generate
volumes” to sustain profitability.  Car Prices  At present, Nissan’s lowest-priced car in India is the
 Micra  compact hatchback that starts at 430,122 rupees ($7,700).
Yomura declined to say how much the Datsun model will cost.  Maruti Suzuki derives the majority of its sales from the
minicar and compact segments that include models with 1.2-liter
engines and a span no longer than 4 meters (13 feet).  Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269) ’s New Delhi-based unit offers its best-selling Alto model starting at 246,500 rupees. Hyundai’s
cheapest model, the Eon, was introduced in 2011, priced from
279,883 rupees.  India is likely to expand to become the world’s third-biggest car market by 2020 from No. 6 in 2010, according to an
 estimate  in 2011 by industry researcher J.D. Power & Associates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
