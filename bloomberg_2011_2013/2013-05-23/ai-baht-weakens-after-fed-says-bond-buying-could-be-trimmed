Thailand’s baht fell by the most in
almost two weeks as speculation the Federal Reserve will scale
back its bond-buying damped demand for emerging-market assets.  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said yesterday the central
bank may taper its $85 billion a month of purchases if it’s
confident of a sustained improvement in the U.S. economy. Thai
first-quarter growth trailed analysts’ estimates, boosting odds
policy makers will cut borrowing costs next week to curb inflows
that helped push the baht to a 16-year high last month.  “The theme of the Fed exiting from the aggressive
quantitative easing is still in the market, making the dollar
strong generally,” said  Tsutomu Soma , manager of Rakuten
Securities Inc.’s fixed-income business unit in  Tokyo . “On the
other hand, Thailand may cut rates to curb the currency
appreciation.”  The baht dropped 0.4 percent, the most since May 10, to
29.92 per dollar as of 9:14 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It declined 0.2 percent this week, paring
its gain this year to 2.2 percent, the best performance in Asia.
The currency reached 28.56 on April 22 and April 19, the
strongest level since July 1997. Onshore markets will be shut
tomorrow for a public holiday.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, fell seven basis
points today to 6.3 percent.  Slowing Growth  Gross domestic product increased 5.3 percent in the first
quarter, less than the 6 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey, official data showed May 20. The Bank of  Thailand  will
cut its policy rate by 25 basis points to 2.5 percent on May 29,
according to two of three economists surveyed by Bloomberg. One
expects no change.  The National Economic and Social Development Board scaled
back its forecast for Thailand’s 2013 economic expansion to as
much as 5.2 percent this week from 5.5 percent. Central bank
Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said May 21 that monetary policy
could be eased if economic growth slows.  The yield on the 3.625 percent government bonds due May
2015 rose one basis point today and this week to 2.7 percent,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
