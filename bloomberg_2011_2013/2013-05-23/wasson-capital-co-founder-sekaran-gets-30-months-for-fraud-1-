(Corrects information from U.S. attorneyâ€™s office on
restitution amount in second paragraph of story published May
23.)  Wasson Capital Advisors co-founder
Anand Sekaran was sentenced to 30 months in prison for
perpetrating a $2.3 million fraud in which he misled investors
about the value of his fund.  U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson in  Manhattan  also
ordered Sekaran, 44, to pay $2.3 million in restitution, U.S.
Attorney Preet Bharara said in an e-mail today.  Sekaran, of Miami, who started New York-based Wasson in
1997, pleaded guilty in November, telling Patterson that he
began to operate a Ponzi scheme after his fund sustained
substantial losses in the 2008 financial crisis and several
redemption requests.  Sekaran pleaded guilty to a count of  securities fraud  and
mail fraud. As part of a plea agreement, he faced 41 to 51
months in prison under sentencing guidelines, Patterson said in
November.  The case is U.S. v. Sekaran, 12-cr-00821, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
