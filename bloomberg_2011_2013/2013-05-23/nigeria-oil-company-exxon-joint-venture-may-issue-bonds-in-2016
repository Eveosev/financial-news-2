Nigeria ’s state-owned oil company and
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s local unit may decide to tap the  bond market 
in 2016 as an alternative source of funding for their joint
venture.  “The challenge of today is that a lot of people are going
into the bank market, and the avenue is being crowded, making it
difficult for us to obtain sufficient funding,” Mobil Producing
Nigeria’s Chief Financial Officer Segun Banwo said in a
 statement  on the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.’s website.
“From the years 2013 to 2015, we will continue to use the
external financing option, but by the year 2016 we would switch
to the bond market.”  Exxon Mobil, the second-largest producer in Nigeria, is the
operator of a joint venture in which it holds a 40 percent
stake, with NNPC holding the rest. The company has daily output
capacity of about 550,000 barrels of crude from 90 offshore
platforms and about 300  oil wells , according to its  website .  Exxon in June said it concluded a $1.5 billion financing
arrangement with NNPC, with a $900 million loan sourced from a
group of Nigerian and international banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
