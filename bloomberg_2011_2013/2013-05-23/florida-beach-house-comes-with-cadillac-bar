111 Bonaire Ln, Bonita Springs FL For sale: $8.85 million The Cadillac inside the house is a real Cadillac, a 1959 Caddy that was driven from the beach into the house and turned into a working bar. “It was backed into the house, and they cut the gas tank out and the back seat and put in a tank and beer taps in the trunk,” said listing agent Barry DeNicola Jr. of  Barry DeNicola Realty . “The whole room is covered in collector license plates and model cars.” The car was put in the game room just a few years ago, DeNicola said, and it’s just one of the features in the beachfront game room. “It’s got a full sports theater with TVs, slot machines, darts, an authentic ice cream bar that came out of the Midwest,” he said. “It’s the ultimate party room, and of course it sits on the beach.” The whole beachfront home was designed to be a party home — a place to set up and entertain. From the Cadillac bar to the commercial-style theater upstairs, the Florida residence has unique amenity atop unique amenity. Looking to star gaze? The house also has an observatory with a professional telescope under a retractable roof. There’s also a commercial elevator, a regulation beach volleyball court, an 8-car garage with a 3-car lift as well as a pool and spa. “It’s just one thing after another,” DeNicola said. “It’s for someone who wants to show off every toy and gizmo and still be on one of the most beautiful beaches in the world.” In terms of the normal house features, the house measures 8,000 square feet with 5 bedrooms and 7 baths. A monthly payment on the home would be $31,390,  using Zillow’s mortgage calculator  and assuming a 20 percent down payment on a 30-year mortgage. Related items from  Zillow Blog :
