Rue21 Inc. (RUE) , the operator of more than
900 teen apparel shops, agreed to be bought by private-equity
firm  Apax Partners  in a $1.1 billion deal.  The purchase price of $42 a share will be paid in cash, the
companies said today in a statement. That represents a 23
percent premium to Rue21’s closing price in  New York  yesterday.
The deal has been approved by Rue21’s board and the company has
40 days to find a superior offer.  Rue21 has been expanding, with plans to open its 1,000th
store by the January and eventually boost its presence to more
than 1,700 locations. The chain, based in Warrendale,
 Pennsylvania , is projected to more than triple its free cash
flow this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “That price is pretty fair,” said Amy Hu Sunderland, a
Hong Kong-based analyst at Grandeur Peak Global Advisors LLC,
which oversees $950 million and owns shares of Rue21. “They can
get a lot of  cash flow  out of it. These guys are not levered at
all, they should be able to get much higher return because they
can lever it up.”  Rue21 shares climbed 23 percent to $41.95 at 10:25 a.m. in
New York, after earlier reaching $42, for the biggest intraday
gain since November 2009. The stock has  advanced  20 percent this
year through yesterday compared to a 21 percent gain for the
Standard & Poor’s SmallCap Consumer Discretionary Index.  Deal Valuation  Apax is paying about 9.2 times earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That compares with the median of 8.4 in a survey
of about 30 comparable deals, the data show.  Funds advised by Apax have invested about $6.3 billion of
equity in retail and consumer businesses, with current and
previous investments including Tommy Hilfiger Corp. and Calvin
Klein Inc.  The SKM II funds, which have been associated with Apax
since 2005 and own about 30 percent of Rue21’s outstanding
shares, have agreed to vote in favor of the transaction. The
deal also will require the approval of investors holding more
than half of Rue21’s shares that aren’t owned by those funds,
the company said.  The SKM fund was formerly managed by Saunders Karp &
Megrue, a middle-market U.S. buyout shop that Apax acquired in
2005. London-based Apax has raised more than $35 billion in
committed capital since it was founded in the early 1980s.  The acquisition follows 38 private-equity deals last year
for apparel and shoe retailers that reached $5.7 billion, the
highest volume since the onset of the U.S. recession in December
2007, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Rue21, whose stores in regional malls and strip centers
compete with low-priced clothing at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and
 Target Corp. (TGT) , is the industry’s latest target after the $835
million buyout of  True Religion Apparel Inc. (TRLG)  earlier this month
and the $600 million deal for retailer  Hot Topic Inc. (HOTT)  in March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
