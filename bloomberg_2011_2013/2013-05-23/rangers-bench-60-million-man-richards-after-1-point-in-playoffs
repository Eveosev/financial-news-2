Brad Richards , the second highest
paid skater on the  New York Rangers , will not be in the lineup
tonight as the National Hockey League team seeks to avoid a
four-game playoff sweep against the  Boston Bruins .  Richards is a healthy scratch for the game at Madison
Square Garden after recording one point in  New York ’s first 10
playoff games, the Rangers said on their website.  The 33-year-old center is in the second year of a nine-year, $60 million contract, with an annual salary cap hit of
$6.66 million, according to ESPN. Only Rick Nash ($7.8 million)
is paid more among Rangers forwards and defensemen.  Richards said on the team website that he needs to “work
harder and try my best so that this will never happen again.”  Winner of the NHL’s postseason Most Valuable Player award
in 2004 with the  Tampa Bay Lightning , Richards was demoted to
the fourth line at the end of New York’s seven-game first-round
series against the Washington Capitals, and had 8:10 of ice time
in the team’s 2-1 loss to the Bruins on May 21, less than half
of the 18:49 he averaged in the regular season.  The Rangers have been outscored 10-5 through the first
three games of the Eastern Conference semifinals against Boston.  Only three teams in NHL history have won a best-of-seven
series after trailing 3-0.  -- Editor: Jay Beberman  To contact the reporters on this story:
