Brazil ’s first auction for the so-called pre-salt region that holds the country’s largest
discoveries will be limited to one field, the government  said .  Brazil’s oil regulator, known as ANP, will conduct the
bidding round in October, according to a statement in the
official gazette published today. The auction will be Brazil’s
first to use a profit-sharing model that was approved by
Congress in 2010, according to the statement.  The Libra field, located in deep waters of the Atlantic
Ocean near Tupi, Brazil’s largest discovery, holds an estimated
5 billion barrels in recoverable reserves, making it the
country’s second-biggest discovery. Brazil’s most productive
wells are located in the pre-salt region, where oil is trapped
miles below the seabed under a layer of salt.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR3) , the state-controlled company, is
required by law to operate all new concessions in the region
with a minimum 30 percent stake. In March the ANP said it would
auction areas holding about 10 billion barrels of recoverable
reserves in the pre-salt region in November.  The region as a whole has surpassed the company’s output
targets. In 2010 Petrobras, as the world’s biggest producer in
waters deeper than 1,000 feet (304 meters) is known, planned to
be pumping 241,000 barrels a day from the pre-salt by 2014. In
March Brazil’s pre-salt oil and gas output reached 349,600
barrels a day, according to the ANP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
