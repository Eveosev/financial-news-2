SoftBank Corp. (9984)  will let the U.S.
government have veto power over one nominee to  Sprint Nextel
Corp. (S) ’s board to ease security concerns if its $20.1 billion
takeover bid succeeds, a person familiar with the matter said.  The government-approved director will monitor national-security issues relating to SoftBank’s takeover of the third-largest U.S. wireless carrier, said the person, who asked not to
be named because the negotiations are private. Mitsuhiro Kurano,
a spokesman for Tokyo-based SoftBank, declined to comment.  SoftBank also has pledged not to integrate equipment from
Huawei Technologies Co. into Sprint’s network because of U.S.
lawmakers’ concerns the Chinese company could aid intelligence
agencies. The SoftBank deal is being reviewed by the Federal
Communications Commission, the U.S. Justice Department and the
inter-agency Committee on Foreign Investment that checks for
security implications of foreign purchases of U.S. companies.  The issue has provided ammunition to  Dish Network Corp. (DISH) ,
the satellite-TV provider that made a $25.5 billion counterbid
for Sprint last month. Dish said today that the steps SoftBank
is taking “do not adequately protect our national security
interests.” As a U.S. company, Dish wouldn’t face the same
review from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the  United
States , or CFIUS.  ‘Security Risks’  “If the news reports are accurate, SoftBank’s agreement to
an extraordinary board structure and the concerns of CFIUS with
respect to the use of Chinese-manufactured equipment on a
foreign-controlled Clearwire network, which reportedly could add
as much as $1 billion to the cost of the proposed SoftBank-Sprint transaction, confirm the serious national security risks
of SoftBank acquiring Sprint,” Stanton Dodge, Dish’s executive
vice president and general counsel, said in a statement.  Sprint agreed to SoftBank’s takeover plan in October,
forging a deal that would give the Japanese company a 70 percent
stake. The  Overland Park , Kansas-based carrier continues to
recommend the SoftBank transaction, even as it opens up its
books to Dish. Sprint said this month that it would give private
financial data to the satellite company, letting Dish build a
case for its competing bid.  California Approval  SoftBank’s bid got a momentum boost today after
California’s Public Utilities Commission signed off on its
Sprint transaction, giving the deal the final state approval it
needed. The process of 23 state reviews took seven months.  “Dish, on the other hand, has not even begun the
regulatory process,” Ron Fisher, president of SoftBank Holdings
Inc., said in a statement.  Sprint shares  were little changed at $7.31 at the close in
New York. The stock has climbed 29 percent this year, putting it
above the per-share price offered by SoftBank and Dish, a sign
investors expect a bidding war to ensue.  The use of Huawei equipment became a bigger issue after a
House Intelligence Committee report last year urged U.S.
companies to steer clear of Huawei and  ZTE Corp. (000063) , citing
concerns that the Chinese government could install malicious
hardware or software in U.S. telecommunications networks. Sprint
owns more than 50 percent of Clearwire Corp., which uses Huawei
gear, and is in the process of trying to acquire the rest of the
business. After the takeover, Sprint would absorb Clearwire’s
assets and have to address the Huawei question.  Removing Equipment  SoftBank,  Japan ’s third-largest wireless carrier, has said
it will remove the Huawei equipment from Clearwire’s system. In
its home country, SoftBank uses base band units and antenna
systems from Huawei and ZTE for its fourth-generation mobile
network. Alcatel-Lucent and Ericsson AB provide the core
network.  Dish hasn’t said how it would handle the existing Huawei
gear in Clearwire’s network, making it unfair for the satellite
provider to criticize SoftBank, said  Paul Kranhold , a U.S.-based
spokesman for the Japanese company. SoftBank also disclosed in
February that the CFIUS review may affect who is on the new
Sprint board, so the idea of giving the government veto power
over a nominee shouldn’t be a surprise, he said.  “Only SoftBank has publicly committed to removing
equipment already located inside a U.S. network that the
government has national security concerns about,” Kranhold
said. “SoftBank’s proposal, therefore, enhances U.S. national
security. Dish has made no such commitment to remove this
 network equipment  and to do so would require Dish to further
increase the amount of debt it will need to complete any
transaction.”  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on SoftBank’s plan
to allow government approval of a board member.  To contact the reporters on this story:
