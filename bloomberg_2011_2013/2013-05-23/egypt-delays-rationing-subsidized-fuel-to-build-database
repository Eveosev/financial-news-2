Egypt  has delayed a plan to ration
subsidized gasoline and diesel as it builds a database that will
help to implement subsidy cuts, Oil Minister Sherif Haddara
said.  The government will soon invite citizens to register online
for eligibility to use smart cards to purchase unlimited amounts
of subsidized fuel for vehicles or agricultural machines, in a
system due to start in July, Haddara told reporters in Cairo
today.  Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous nation, is struggling
to finance its fuel and food imports after  foreign-currency
reserves  shrank following the 2011 uprising against  Hosni Mubarak . Cutting subsidies is central to negotiations with the
 International Monetary Fund  on a $4.8 billion loan. The new
rationing system had initially been planned for April.  Haddara said the delay was caused by a “technical reason
only” and that the proposed system hasn’t changed. He said the
government will collect information such as the quantity of fuel
bought by each card-holder and the level of demand at each
filling station.  “We first want to know the quantity people consume and
what the current consumption pattern is,” Haddara said. “We
need a month or two to know the pattern,” after which the
government will decide how to ration the subsidized fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
