International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) 
and Waterfund LLC, a risk-management provider, agreed to add
 Uganda  to their global Water Cost Index, the first African
member of the investing tool the companies announced in January.  The agreement with Uganda’s Ministry of Water and
Environment will let IBM collect data to calculate the cost of
producing water, in dollars per cubic meter, said Peter Williams, chief technology officer of Big Green Innovations at
IBM.  Global water use has grown at more than twice the rate of
population increase over the last century, according to the
 United Nations . A growing number of nations are turning to the
private sector to build and maintain water networks, and
information such as the water index may facilitate investment,
Williams said.  “The primary purpose is to enable more  capital investment 
in a sector that desperately needs it,” Williams said today in
an interview from Uganda. “This is not a  price index  -- it’s a
cost index. The price that you charge for water is an entirely
different decision than the cost of getting it there in the
first place.”  The first version of the index will be released next month
with information from about a half-dozen nations, he said. “The
goal is to build it out to 25 percent of the world’s GDP.” The
index will also include countries in Asia and the Americas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
