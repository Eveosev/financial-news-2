Asian  stocks  sank, with the regional
benchmark index headed for the biggest drop since September
2011, as Japanese shares plummeted after preliminary China
manufacturing data unexpectedly signaled a contraction and the
yen strengthened.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average and the broader Topix
Index both fell more than 6 percent, the most since the
aftermath of the 2011 earthquake, and futures trading in Osaka
was suspended. Every Asian market outside Sri Lanka retreated
after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke yesterday said a
premature withdrawal of quantitative easing would put the U.S.
economic recovery at risk.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 3.4 percent to 138.59
as of 6:28 p.m. in  Tokyo , with about 12 shares falling for each
that rose. The measure rose 11 percent this year through
yesterday as Japanese shares surged amid record stimulus by the
Bank of Japan and signs of improvement in the U.S. economy.  “The market has been looking for an excuse for a
correction,” said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based head of investment
strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which oversees $126
billion. “Bernanke’s comments and China’s PMI data provided the
trigger for a sell-off. Technically, Japanese shares have been
overbought and were vulnerable for a correction.”  Trading Suspended  Futures trading in  Osaka  was halted at 14,780 yen at 2:28
p.m. in Tokyo as circuit-breakers were triggered, Yoshifumi
Hanatani, an official at the Osaka Exchange, said by phone. It
is the first time trading of the contracts have been halted
since March 15, 2011, in the immediate aftermath of Japan’s
earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster. The contracts
retreated 1.3 percent after markets shut, signaling further
declines tomorrow.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 plunged 7.3 percent and Topix slumped
6.9 percent, their biggest daily drop since March 15, 2011.
Financial companies led the decline as every stock in the Nikkei
225 retreated for the first since April 2005. Both gauges were
up almost 40 percent this year through today as the Bank of
 Japan  stepped up efforts to end deflation.  Former Ministry of Finance official Eisuke Sakakibara
predicted a drop last week. Japanese equities have risen “too
much, too fast,” particularly financial stocks, and need “some
kind of correction” before they can resume their climb,
Sakakibara, known as known as “Mr. Yen” for his efforts to
influence exchange rates in the late 1990s, said in a Bloomberg
interview on May 15. The BOJ’s unprecedented stimulus is showing
signs of success, he said.  The 14-day  relative strength index , a measure of trading
momentum, held above 70 for both Japanese gauges for the
previous nine days. That level is considered by some traders as
a signal to sell as the market has risen too fast.  Volatility Jumps  The Nikkei Volatility Index jumped 58 percent to 43.74, the
biggest advance since March 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The 50-day volatility for the Topix climbed to 28.83,
the highest since May 2011, the data showed.  “There’s a lot of profit-taking going on,” said  Tomomi Yamashita , a fund manager who helps oversee the equivalent of $5
billion at Shinkin Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “When
volatility is high,  investors want to take off risk.”  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  dropped 2.5 percent while
China’s Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.2 percent. South Korea’s
 Kospi Index (KOSPI)  decreased 1.2 percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
slid 2 percent, while New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index lost 0.5
percent. Taiwan’s  Taiex Index  retreated 1.9 percent.  Chinese Manufacturing  China’s manufacturing is contracting in May for the first
time in seven months, adding to signs that economic growth is
losing steam for a second quarter. The preliminary reading of
49.6 for a Purchasing Managers’ Index released today by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics compares with a final 50.4 for
April. The number was also below the 50.4 median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 13 analysts. A reading below 50
indicates contraction.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 1.1
percent. The gauge yesterday fell 0.8 percent, reversing an
earlier 1.1 percent advance, as Bernanke said the central bank
could “step down” the pace of asset purchases if the labor
market continues to improve.  “Bernanke is making it very clear to markets that at some
point they will be likely to reduce the level of bond purchases
and that’s an important point for the market to digest,” said
 Angus Gluskie , managing director at Sydney-based White Funds
Management, which oversees more than $350 million. “He’s saying
we’re going to wind this down at some point, but not with the
economy the way it is.”  Exporters Drop  Exporters dropped.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest
automaker, slipped 5.1 percent to 6,290 yen. Canon Inc., the
world’s biggest camera maker, sank 3.9 percent to 3,735 yen.  Li
& Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes to retailers
including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., declined 4.4 percent to HK$10.88
in Hong Kong.  Japanese developers and lenders dropped as bond yields
increased. Mitsubishi Estate Co., Japan’s biggest developer by
market value, sank 9.3 percent to 2,603 yen. Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc., the nation’s largest publicly traded
lender, plunged 9.3 percent to 634 yen.  Raw-material producers declined on concern demand for
commodities in  China  will weaken amid signs growth in the
world’s second-biggest economy is slowing.  Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s biggest producer of the metal,
slid 2.6 percent to HK$15.52 in Hong Kong.  Aluminum Corp. of
China Ltd. , the nation’s biggest producer of the lightweight
metal, sank 2.8 percent to HK$3.14. Cnooc Ltd., China’s largest
offshore oil producer, fell 2.5 percent to HK$14.06.  ComfortDelgro Corp. slumped 12 percent to S$1.925.
Singapore Labour Foundation raised S$329.8 million ($260
million) selling 170 million shares at S$1.94 apiece, 11 percent
lower than yesterday’s closing price, according to terms for the
deal obtained by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
