Hungary charged 45 people for taking
part in a global soccer match-fixing crime ring, chief
investigating prosecutor Imre Keresztes said in a statement.  The cheating affected 32 games, including an international
match between two countries, a first-division game in the
Italian league, three in the Finnish league and 11 Hungarian
first-division matches, Keresztes said in an e-mail today.  Europol police agency in February said a Singapore-based
operation tried to fix games across  Europe , including  World Cup 
and European Championship qualifiers, and generated more than 8
million euros ($10.3 million) in profit. An 18-month probe found
425 match officials, club executives, players and criminals in
15 countries worked to cheat in more than 380 matches, with
another 300 targeted in other regions.  The suspects charged included Eng T.S. of  Singapore ,
against whom authorities issued an international arrest warrant,
as well as current and former Hungarian soccer players, umpires,
club owners and coaches, the prosecutor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
