A proposed $500 million fund to help
developers of geothermal power explore new sites for projects
may leverage about $9.6 billion of new investment, unleashing as
much as 2,400 megawatts of capacity, a report found.  A geothermal exploration drilling fund, pooling money from
either private investors and banks or government entities and
development banks, would help finance about 473 megawatts across
24 projects, London-based researcher Bloomberg New Energy
Finance said today. This would encourage another 1,927
megawatts, it said.  “It is $5 million to $9 million to develop each well, and
so it costs about $10 million to $36 million just to know
whether or not a particular resource merits development, since
any developer would need to drill between two and four wells per
site,” Jessica Thompson, president of Rinova International,
which worked with BNEF on the report, said.  The high costs and high risks associated with drilling
exploratory wells mean developers find it difficult to raise
equity or debt. Only about six percent of the world’s estimated
geothermal potential has been tapped, according to BNEF. The
fund would offer debt financing to exploration-phase projects at
rates that would be attractive enough to make geothermal
projects viable, it said.  Geothermal energy harnesses steam or hot water from
underground to generate electricity. Unlike other renewables,
geothermal technology is proven and it provides constant power
at a cost close to that of fossil-fuels,  Mark Taylor , lead
geothermal analyst at BNEF, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
