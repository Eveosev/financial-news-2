New Zealand forward  Ali Williams 
retired from international rugby after playing 77 Tests in a
decade-long career for the All Blacks.  Williams, 32, made the announcement today in a video posted
on his  Twitter account . The second-rower said he’ll continue to
play for the Auckland Blues in the Super Rugby competition.  “Guys, I just want to let you know first that I’m retiring
from international rugby,” Williams said. “I’m hanging up the
black jersey. It’s been an amazing 10 years but it’s time to
call it quits. But I’m not hanging up the boots yet.”  The 6-foot-6, 262-pound Williams, who made his Test debut
in 2002, played in three Rugby World Cups for  New Zealand ,
picking up a winners’ medal after the All Blacks’ victory over
 France  in the 2011 final in his hometown of Auckland.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
