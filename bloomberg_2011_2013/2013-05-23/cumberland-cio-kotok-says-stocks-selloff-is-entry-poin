A selloff in equities has created an
opportunity for investors to buy assets that will rebound and
reach new highs, according to David Kotok, chief investment
officer at Cumberland Advisors Inc.  “This is an entry opportunity,” Kotok said in a
television interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” from  New
York . “The entry point is going to come very robustly and then
this market goes much higher. All the central banks are still
committed to quantitative easing.”  Global stocks fell today, led by the biggest drop in
 Japanese (NKY)  shares since the aftermath of a tsunami and earthquake
that caused the Fukushima power-plant disaster two years ago,
while metals sank as Chinese manufacturing unexpectedly
contracted and speculation mounted the  Federal Reserve  will cut
bond purchases.  Cumberland is “fully invested” in stocks, with about 80
percent of its money placed in the asset class and 20 percent in
bonds, Kotok said. The firm oversees $2.2 billion, according to
its website.  The  U.S. economy  remains hampered by high unemployment and
government spending cuts, and tightening policy too soon would
endanger the recovery, Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
yesterday in testimony prepared for a hearing at the Joint
Economic Committee of Congress in Washington.  Still, Bernanke signaled that the central bank will scale
back stimulus if economic conditions improve. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.8 percent yesterday after his comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
