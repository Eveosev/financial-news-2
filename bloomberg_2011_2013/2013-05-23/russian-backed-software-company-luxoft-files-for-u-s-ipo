Luxoft Holding Inc. , a Russian-backed
 software developer  providing services to  Deutsche Bank AG (DB) ,  UBS
AG (UBSN)  and  Boeing Co. (BA) , filed for an initial public offering in New
York.  The company is preparing for a $80 million offering,
according to a regulatory  filing  yesterday. The amount is a
placeholder that may change. UBS,  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  VTB Capital (VTBR)  and Cowen & Co. are managing
the sale.  Luxoft is a unit of Moscow-based  IBS Group Holding Ltd. (IBSG) ,
which is traded in Germany. IBS President and main shareholder
Anatoly Karachinsky said in November he sought to spin off
Luxoft, which sells to global corporations, to unlock value for
shareholders who aren’t interested in the Russian part of the
group’s business.  The idea of a Luxoft IPO was inspired by  Epam Systems Inc. (EPAM) ,
a software developer with roots in the Commonwealth of
Independent States that sold shares in New York  last year ,
according to Karachinsky. Epam shares almost doubled since the
IPO, valuing the company at $1.07 billion.  Luxoft, based in Zug, Switzerland, increased revenue 16
percent for the year ended March 31 to $315 million, while net
income was $38 million, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
