Residual-fuel inventories in
 Singapore , Asia’s largest oil-trading and storage center, fell
for the first time in four weeks, according to a unit of the
Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Stockpiles including fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy residue
and excluding bitumen declined 1.7 million barrels, or 7.4
percent, to 20.7 million in the seven days to yesterday,
 International Enterprise Singapore  said today in an e-mailed
statement. Supplies dropped from 22.3 million the previous week,
the highest level in five months.  Light-distillate inventories including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate climbed 800,000 barrels, or 8.3 percent, to 10.5
million, according to the data. That’s the first increase in
three weeks.  Stockpiles of  middle distillates  including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene decreased 237,000 barrels, or 2.5 percent,
to 9.3 million, the ministry’s data showed. Supplies slid to a
four-week low.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
