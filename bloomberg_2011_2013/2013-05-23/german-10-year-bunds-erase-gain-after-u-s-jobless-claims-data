German 10-year bunds erased an
advance after a report showed fewer Americans than projected
filed applications for  unemployment benefits  last week.  The 10-year bund yield was little changed at 1.43 percent
as of 1:36 p.m. London time, after earlier dropping five basis
points to 1.38 percent.  Spanish and Italian  government bonds  extended declines. The
rate on Spainâ€™s 10-year securities rose eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 4.26 percent. Similar-maturity Italian
yields climbed 12 basis points to 4.03 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
