Lundin Petroleum  AB, a Swedish gas
and oil exploration company, fell to its lowest level in two
months after the company said a wildcat well in the  North Sea 
was abandoned as a dry hole.  The shares declined as much as 3 percent to 139.30 kronor,
the lowest level since March 27. Lundin Petroleum had declined
2.5 percent as of 12:44 p.m. in Stockholm.  The 7/4-3 well is the first exploration well in licenses
PL495 and PL495B, Lundin Petroleum said today in a statement.
The Stockholm-based company had expected to find proof of
petroleum in the upper triassic reservoir rocks and in the upper
cretaceous chalk reservoir. The costs of drilling 7/4-3 will
probably be booked in the second quarter, the company said.  The rig will now be moved to the Lundin Petroleum-operated
Brynhild field, located 24 kilometers (15 miles) from the dry
well, to start drilling of development wells, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
