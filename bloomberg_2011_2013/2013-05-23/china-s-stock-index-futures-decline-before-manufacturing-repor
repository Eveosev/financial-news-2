more than 3 percent, sending consumer-discretionary stocks to
the biggest loss among industry groups.  Jiangxi Copper Co. (600362) , the

avoiding stocks related to traditional manufacturing
industries,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based  fund manager  at

selloff in  Japan  has spread risk-off sentiment across the
region.”  Chinese stocks extended losses in the afternoon after

2011, as financial companies plunged amid rising bond yields.  The Shanghai Composite has rebounded 4.7 percent from this

official PMI in April was 50.6, down from 50.9 in March.  A

now that China’s GDP growth rate in the second quarter will be
lower than in the first quarter,” he said, referring to gross
domestic product. After today’s PMI report, Societe Generale SA
said it expects official manufacturing data due on June 1 to
also show a contraction, according to a note to clients.  Metal Stocks  A gauge tracking consumer-discretionary stocks retreated 2
