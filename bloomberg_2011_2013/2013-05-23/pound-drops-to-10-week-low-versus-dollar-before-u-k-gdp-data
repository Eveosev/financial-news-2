The pound climbed from a 10-week low
versus the dollar amid speculation its 3 percent fall this month
was excessive and as a government report confirmed the U.K.
economy returned to growth in the first quarter.  Sterling advanced against most of its 16 major peers as the
report showed inventories increased and  consumer spending  rose.
 Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King  said on May 15 that a
recovery was in sight. The central bank also boosted its
economic forecast, predicting growth will quicken to 0.5 percent
this quarter. U.K. government bonds were little changed.  “In view of the scale of the move there may be an
opportunity to pick up some sterling at cheaper levels,” said
 Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce in  London . “We could be getting to the stage
where we’re pricing in too much concern. There’s a fair amount
of event risk priced into the pound already.”  The pound strengthened 0.3 percent to $1.5101 at 4:43 p.m.
London time after dropping to $1.5014, the weakest since March
14. Sterling depreciated 0.1 percent to 85.54 pence per euro.  Gross domestic product  rose 0.3 percent, matching an
estimate published on April 25, the  Office for National
Statistics  said. Inventories increased by 2.5 billion pounds in
the quarter, adding 0.4 percentage point to GDP. Consumer
spending rose 0.1 percent.  “There is a welcome change in the economic outlook,” King
said on May 15, when the central bank published its quarterly
Inflation Report. “We don’t see a particularly rapid recovery
in the next few quarters but we do see a recovery and I think
there are good reasons for that.”  Pound Recommendation  Investors should buy the pound versus the dollar, targeting
an advance to $1.54, according to Adrian Schmidt, a currency
strategist at Lloyds Banking Group Plc in London. They should
exit the trade if the U.K. currency declines to $1.4980, he
wrote in a note to clients.  The pound has weakened 3.2 percent this year, the second-worst performer after the yen among the 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar gained 5.1 percent and the euro rose 2.7 percent.  The 10-year gilt yielded 1.91 percent. The price of the
1.75 percent bond maturing in September 2022 was at 98.61.  Gilts lost 1.9 percent this month through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds dropped
1 percent and Treasuries fell 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
