The South African Reserve Bank said
it’s comfortable with its holdings of gold, which make up about
10 percent of  foreign reserves .  South Africa doesn’t have plans to boost gold reserves
because they already account for 10 percent of the total, unlike
many central banks that are buying bullion to reach that ratio
as prices fall, Deputy Governor  Daniel Mminele  told reporters in
 Pretoria  today.  “At this particular point in time we seem quite
comfortable,” Mminele said. “Some of these central banks would
come off very low levels and are looking at getting to levels of
around 10 percent of holdings in gold and we’re already there.”  Gold has fallen as much as 29 percent from its September
2011 record of $1,923.70 an ounce after rallying for 12 straight
years. South Africa’s central bank holds four million fine
ounces in gold, Mminele said.  South Africa’s gold and foreign currency reserves rose 0.6
percent to $50 billion in April, according to the Reserve Bank.
Gold holdings fell 8.3 percent from a month earlier to $5.9
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
