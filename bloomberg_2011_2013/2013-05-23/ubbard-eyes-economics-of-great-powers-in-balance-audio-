Glenn Hubbard , dean and professor 
at the Columbia Business School, explains the thesis of his book
"Balance: The Economics of Great Powers from Ancient Rome to 
Modern America," co-authored with Tim Kane of the Hudson 
Institute, and why the U.S. must cut its debt to avoid the fate 
of previous "empires." Hubbard speaks with Bloomberg's Kathleen
