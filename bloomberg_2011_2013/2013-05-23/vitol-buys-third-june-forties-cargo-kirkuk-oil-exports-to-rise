Vitol Group bought its third North
Sea Forties crude cargo for loading in June at a lower price
than the previous trade. No bids or offers were made for Russian
Urals blend.  Iraq plans to increase exports of its Kirkuk crude in June
from the Turkish port of Ceyhan to 18 cargoes, three more than
this month, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  North Sea  Vitol bought Forties cargo F0606 for loading on June 7 to
June 9 from  BP Plc (BP/)  at 30 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window. That compares with a
discount of 20 cents it got for a purchase on May 21.  Last week Vitol booked a very large crude carrier Maersk
Sandra to load crude on June 4 from Hound Point in the U.K.,
reports from shipbrokers, including ICAP Shipping International
Ltd., showed on May 20. Hound Point is the loading terminal for
Forties. A VLCC typically holds 2 million barrels of crude.  BP withdrew its offer for Oseberg grade for June 7 to June
9 loading at a premium of 85 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, the
survey showed.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  withdrew two offers. One was for
Forties for June 3 to June 5 at 25 cents less than Dated Brent,
and the other for Oseberg for the same period at a premium of 80
cents, according to the survey. The Oseberg cargo was originally
planned to be exported from May 29 to May 31, said two people
with knowledge of the loading program.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days fell by 11 cents to a discount of 37 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent, the lowest since May 1, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for July settlement traded at $101.26 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window, compared
with $103.30 yesterday. The August contract was at $101.09 at
the same time today, a discount of 17 cents to July.  Mediterranean/Urals  Socar Trading SA failed to sell 600,000 barrels of Azeri
Light for June 3 to June 7 at $2.35 a barrel more than Dated
Brent, according to the survey. That compares with a premium of
$2.60 for a cargo it sold yesterday.  Urals in the Mediterranean fell by 22 cents to a discount
of 15 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was at 34 cents a
barrel to the benchmark, compared with 20 cents yesterday.  Shipments of Kirkuk will total 9.07 million barrels, or
302,333 barrels a day, the plan showed. That compares with
248,710 barrels planned for May.  OAO Surgutneftegas sold three cargoes of Urals for loading
from two Baltic ports, according to three people with knowledge
of the matter who asked not to be identified because information
is confidential.  The producer sold one cargo for June 6 to June 7 loading
from Primorsk to Total SA and another for June 7 to June 8 from
the same port to  Neste Oil Oyj (NES1V) , they said.  The third shipment for June 8 to June 9 from Ust-Luga was
sold to Glencore Xstrata Plc. All consignments are for 100,000
metric tons each.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend fell by 13 cents to $2.70
a barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg

July to four cargoes of 950,000 barrels each, one more than
June, according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
