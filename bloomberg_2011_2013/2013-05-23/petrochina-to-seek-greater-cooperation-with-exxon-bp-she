PetroChina Co. (857) , the country’s biggest
oil and gas producer, will seek to increase cooperation with
companies including  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,  BP Plc (BP/)  and  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  as it looks to add overseas resources.  The Beijing-based company will also seek to work with  Eni
SpA (ENI)  and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  as its makes expansion abroad a priority,
Chairman Zhou Jiping told reporters today in Beijing. The
cooperation could involve teaming up to make acquisitions or
joint exploration activities, Mao Zefeng, the company’s Beijing-based spokesman said after the press conference.  PetroChina and its state-owned parent China National
Petroleum Corp. have announced plans to spend about $7 billion
in the past six months on assets from Mozambique to Australia,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Zhou was appointed as
chairman in April after  Jiang Jiemin  was promoted to the
minister of China’s state-owned enterprises supervisor.  The publicly traded unit plans to invest at least $60
billion this decade in global oil and natural gas assets to
increase the share of overseas output to half of its total,
former Chairman Jiang Jiemin said in 2010.  PetroChina fell 2.2 percent to HK$9:50 as of 11:59 am in
Hong Kong. The stock has dropped 13 percent this year, compared
with a 1 percent gain at the city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
