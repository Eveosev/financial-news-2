Chicago billionaire  Penny Pritzker 
probably will be confirmed as U.S. Commerce secretary, Senator
 John Thune  of  South Dakota , top Republican on the Senate
Commerce panel, said today after she testified at a hearing.  “She acquitted herself really well today,” Thune told
reporters, referring to questions about her role in a Illinois
bank’s collapse and income from offshore trust investments. “I
can’t see that there’s anything that would keep her from getting
through the process in pretty good shape.”  Thune said he can’t say at this time how he’ll vote,
because “loose ends” needed to be tied up. He said he was
satisfied by Pritzker’s answers on the bank and offshore
investments.  “We haven’t seen anything disqualifying in her record or
her background,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
