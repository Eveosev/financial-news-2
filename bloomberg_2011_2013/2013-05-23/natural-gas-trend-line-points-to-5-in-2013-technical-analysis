Natural gas futures have reversed a
two-year downtrend over the past several weeks and may top $5 in
the third quarter, according to a technical analysis by Piper
Jaffray Cos.  A five-year weekly chart of trading ranges shows that gas
prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange are posting higher
highs and higher lows that crossed and stayed above a bearish
trend line in March, said Craig Johnson, technical market
strategist with the company in  Minneapolis .  That reverses a downward path from a January 2010 peak of
$6.108 per million British thermal units, when gas began to post
lower highs and lower lows, he said. Prices rallied to $4.444
per million Btu on May 1, the highest intraday price in 21
months, after dipping to this year’s low of $3.05 in January.  “Natural gas is finding support on the short-term trend
line at the 50-day moving average, and next on the horizon is
going to be $4.444,” Johnson said. “We are setting ourselves
up for $5 natural gas if we can break that top-side level.”  A test of the $4.50 resistance level is about 30 days away,
and after topping that gas may close the gap to $5 sometime in
the third quarter, Johnson said. Hot weather driving demand for
the power-plant fuel to run air conditioners may provide
fundamental support in that drive upward, he said.  Johnson used the same five-year weekly trend line in early
December to predict that gas prices, which rallied near $4 in
November, would plunge back to the $3.20 to $3.30 range within a
month or so.  Gas for June delivery fell 0.6 cent, or 0.1 percent, to
$4.186 per million Btu yesterday on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange, up 25 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
