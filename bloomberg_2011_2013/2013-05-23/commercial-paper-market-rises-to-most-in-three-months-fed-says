The market for corporate borrowing
through  commercial paper  expanded to the most in almost three
months as issuance from industrial and financial firms rose.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
increased for a second week, climbing $19.8 billion to $1.033
trillion outstanding in the period ended yesterday, the Federal
Reserve said today on its website. Thatâ€™s the highest level
since $1.063 trillion for the period ended Feb. 27.  Commercial paper sold by non-U.S. financial institutions 
increased $1.7 billion to $242.5 billion outstanding, the
highest level since the period ended Feb. 6, while the  amount
issued by U.S.-based banks  rose $9.3 billion to $302.8 billion
outstanding, the most since March 27, according to the Fed.  IOUs issued by  non-financial  companies jumped $9.9 billion
to $209.2 billion, the most since March 13, the Fed said.  Corporations sell commercial paper, typically maturing in
270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such as rent and
salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
