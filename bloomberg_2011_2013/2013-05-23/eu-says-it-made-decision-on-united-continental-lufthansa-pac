 European Union regulators said they
reached an unspecified decision on a proposed settlement by
 Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  and  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  to
end a European Union antitrust probe of their A++ trans-Atlantic
venture also involving  Air Canada. (AC/A)   Regulators “are in the process of establishing a version
of the decision that does not contain any business secrets or
other confidential information, no public version of this text
is available for the time being,” the European Commission said
on its  website  today. Officials are “trying to settle
this issue as soon as possible with a view to a quick
publication.”  EU regulators said in December they were seeking views from
competitors and customers on a settlement offer from the
airlines that would enable rivals to start as many as seven
weekly flights between  Frankfurt  and New York’s  John F. Kennedy 
or Newark Liberty airports. A settlement would permit the
venture to go ahead without the risk of EU fines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
