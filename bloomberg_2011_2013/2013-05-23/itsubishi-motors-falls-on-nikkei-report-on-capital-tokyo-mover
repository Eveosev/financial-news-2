Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211)  fell the most
in more than two years after the Nikkei newspaper reported the
carmaker is planning a capital reorganization to offset
accumulated losses.  The  stock  fell as much as 11 percent to 162 yen, headed
for the biggest decline since March 2011, before trading at 173
yen as of 10:44 a.m. in Tokyo trading. The benchmark Nikkei 225
Stock Average rose 1.6 percent.  Mitsubishi’s  board  plans to meet this week to discuss a
reduction of capital and raising the limit on the company’s
ability to issue new shares, the Nikkei reported today, without
saying where it got the information. Separately, the Tokyo
Shimbun reported the company is planning to sell stock. The
company said in a statement today that it wasn’t the source of
reports related to future financing.  Mitsubishi was saddled with  924.6 billion yen  ($8.9
billion) in negative retained earnings as of the end of March,
according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
