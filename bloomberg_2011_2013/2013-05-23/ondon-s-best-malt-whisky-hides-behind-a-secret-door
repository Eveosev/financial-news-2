For years, when I've been in London, I've gone to a place in Soho that is a magnet for lovers of single malt whiskies—the Vintage House in Old Compton Street. It keeps a stock of 1,400 whiskies including many extremely rare single malts. In the past 20 years, Scottish distillers have built single malts into a worldwide cult, displacing cognac as the connoisseur's spirit of choice. In all my visits to this whiskey den, I've been so mesmerized by the array of golden liquid glittering on the shelves—in bottles of many shapes, sizes, and vintages—that I never noticed the unmarked door to the left as you enter. Then, the other day, I was taken there by a friend who led me through the door and up a flight of stairs into a long, light, and airy room, paneled with blond wood. One wall was lined with more than 400 single malts. I had discovered the shrine of malt connoisseurs, the  Soho Whisky Club . There was another lure, too: a collection of fine hand-rolled Cuban cigars. (If you want to smoke, there is an outdoor terrace.) My own favorite single malt comes from the treeless and wind-scoured Orkney Islands, where there are only two distillers, Highland Park and my choice, Scapa. (The Orkneys are linked to the Scottish mainland by the world's shortest scheduled flight, 1 minute and 14 seconds.) Scapa, founded in 1885, was mothballed in 1994 but reopened and re-equipped in 2004; the oldest vintage available generally (including at the Soho Whisky Club) is the 16-year-old variety, which, unlike many single malts that leave a taste in the mouth of smoky peat, has a more emollient and lingering honey flavor. You can find an extremely rare and much-prized 25-year-old Scapa, but even the Soho Whisky Club didn't have it. (A bottle was available at Amazon at £200, too much for me to swallow.) There is also an American connection to the club. After World War II, an officer in the U.S. Army Air Force, George Mullin, married the daughter of the Italian owners of the Vintage House and eventually took it over. His son, Malcolm, now runs the store and the club. And I imagine that there are many whisky connoisseurs in the U.S. who also like the forbidden pleasure of Cuban cigars and who would willingly the pay the £200 annual fee to go through that secret door in Old Compton Street when they are in London.
