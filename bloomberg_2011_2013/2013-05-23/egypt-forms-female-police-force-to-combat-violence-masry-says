Egypt ’s Ministry of Interior has
formed its first, all-female police unit to combat sexual
harassment and other violence against women, Al-Masry Al-Youm
newspaper reported.  The 10-member unit will coordinate the ministry’s campaign
in a country of more than 80 million where women have long
complained of daily sexual harassment. The newspaper report
yesterday on its formation cited Mervat Tallawy, head of the
state-backed National Council for Women, and Hussein Fikry, the
Interior Minister’s Assistant for Human Rights.  Tallawy said her group had asked for a female force and
units at police stations to deal with violence against women,
Al-Masry reported. The  Interior Ministry  will issue a newsletter
to inform the public of the unit’s efforts, Fikry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
