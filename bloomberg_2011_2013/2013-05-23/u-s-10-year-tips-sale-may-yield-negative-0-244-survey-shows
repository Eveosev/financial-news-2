The government’s $13 billion auction
of 10-year inflation-indexed notes may draw a yield of negative
0.244 percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey of eight of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary
dealers.  The Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, which mature
in January 2023, yielded negative 0.255 percent in trading
before the auction. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New York  time.  The last offering of 10-year TIPS, a $13 billion sale on
March 21, drew a yield of negative 0.602 percent, the eighth
consecutive time an auction of the securities yielded less than
zero. The record auction low of negative 0.75 percent was
reached on Sept. 20.  TIPS pay interest at lower rates than nominal Treasuries on
a principal amount that’s linked to the Labor Department’s
consumer price index.  The March sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.74,
versus an average of 2.69 for the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , a category of investor that includes
foreign central banks, bought 51.3 percent of the securities at
the March auction, compared with 53.3 percent at the January
sale. The average for the past 10 offerings is 44.5 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 5.7 percent of the
notes at the last sale, versus 11.3 percent in January and an
average of 14.8 percent at the past 10 auctions.  TIPS Returns  U.S. inflation-linked debt maturing in 10 or more years
returned 12 percent last year, compared with a 7.3 percent gain
in the broader TIPS market and a 2.2 percent advance in the
overall Treasury market, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes.  This year, longer-term inflation-protected Treasuries have
lost 5.4 percent, while all TIPS have fallen 2.8 percent. That
compares with a negative 0.6 percent for regular  U.S. government
debt , the indexes show.  For the month, TIPS have declined 3.2 percent, on track for
their worst monthly performance since October 2008, when they
lost 8.5 percent as investor expectations for inflation
collapsed in the wake of the financial crisis.  Primary dealers trade  government securities  with the
central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
