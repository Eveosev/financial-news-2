The Australian dollar fell to its
lowest level in almost a year before U.S. data that may show a
recovery in the world’s largest economy is being sustained.  The Aussie extended its decline this month to 6.8 percent,
set for the biggest drop since September 2011, after Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday the central bank
may taper monthly bond purchases if it’s confident of sustained
gains in the economy. The  New Zealand dollar  dropped to its
weakest in eight months before a private report forecast to show
Chinese  manufacturing  growth stalled in May.  “It’s the question now of when does the stimulus start to
be wound back?” said  Imre Speizer , a strategist in Auckland at
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  “There will be further fallout to
Bernanke’s remark over the next few days and that will probably
push the  U.S. dollar  higher and push currencies like the Aussie
and kiwi lower.”  The Australian dollar dropped 0.3 percent to 96.69 U.S.
cents as of 9:54 a.m. in Sydney after touching 96.55, the least
since June 4. It fell 0.3 percent to 99.72 yen. The kiwi
declined 0.4 percent to 80.45 U.S. cents and touched 80.33, the
weakest since Sept. 7. It slid 0.4 percent to 82.97 yen.  Fewer Americans filed claims for  jobless benefits  last
week, the U.S. Labor department is forecast to say today.  The number of applications for unemployment insurance
payments fell by 15,000 to 345,000 in the week ended May 18,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Minutes of the Fed’s last meeting released yesterday showed
that a “number” of officials were willing to taper bond buying
as early as the next meeting in June if economic reports show
“evidence of sufficiently strong and sustained growth.”  A  Purchasing Managers ’ Index for  China  from HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics was probably unchanged at 50.4 in May,
according to a Bloomberg survey before the report today. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
