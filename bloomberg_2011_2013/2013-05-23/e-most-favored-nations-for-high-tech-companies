For tech startups looking to go public, there's no better place than the U.S., as  Tableau Software reminded us last week .  The provider of digital charting tools raised $254 million, the largest initial public offering for a U.S. tech company this year. Tableau delivered an  off-the-charts return of more than 3,000 percent  on its opening day to New Enterprise Associates, an early investor.  But  beyond the U.S. , what other countries are hospitable to high-tech public offerings? Bloomberg Rankings set out to answer that question by examining about a hundred countries to determine which had the highest percentage of public companies in high-tech. Companies in that industry specialize in aerospace and defense, biotechnology, hardware, software, Internet software and services, semiconductors, and renewable energy. Here's what they found: Country (% of public companies in high-tech) (Note: Only companies that have been public a year or longer and have a market value of at least $1 million were included. Also, countries with fewer than 100 publicly listed companies overall were excluded.)
