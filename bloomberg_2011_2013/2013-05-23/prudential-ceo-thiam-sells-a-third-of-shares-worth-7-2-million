Prudential Plc (PRU)  Chief Executive
Officer Tidjane Thiam sold a third of his shares in the U.K.’s
largest insurer after a 2010 performance-based compensation plan
paid out in full and the stock soared.  Thiam, 50, sold 400,000 shares at 11.93 pounds apiece,
realizing about 4.8 million pounds ($7.2 million) on May 22, the
London-based insurer said in a statement today. Chief Financial
Officer Nic Nicandrou, 47, sold 2.4 million pounds in shares and
 Michael McLintock , 52, CEO of fund-management arm M&G, sold
stock valued at 3.6 million pounds.  Prudential, which got 55 percent of its new business profit
from Asia in the first quarter, has doubled since Thiam took
charge in 2009 as markets rebounded after the financial crisis
and the firm expanded sales in Asian markets such as  Indonesia 
and the  Philippines . Thiam this year became the first-serving
CEO of a FTSE 100 Index company to be publicly reprimanded by
the U.K. regulator for failing to inform the authorities early
enough of a $35.5 billion takeover bid for Asian  AIA Group Ltd. (1299) 
in 2010.  “These are the first shares he has sold since he joined
the company except those that were required to be sold for tax
purposes,” Prudential said in an e-mailed statement. “All the
executive directors retain substantial stakes in Prudential,
which are well above the shareholding guidelines required by the
company for board members.”  Thiam still owns stock valued at 10.4 million pounds and
has 14.6 million pounds locked up under share-award plans,
according to the statement. Shareholding guidelines published in
the firm’s  2012 annual report  state Thiam should own shares
valued at 350 percent of his 1.03 million-pound salary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
