Ukraine may agree on an  International
Monetary Fund  loan by September because of a wide current-account gap and limited access to global financial markets,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  “The current-account deficit is likely to come in at
around 8 percent of gross domestic product, or $12 billion to
$14 billion,” Andrew Matheny, a Moscow-based analyst at
Goldman, said today in an e-mailed note. “This would bring
reserves from the current $25 billion down to $13 billion to $15
billion, in our view an unsustainably-low level.”  Ukraine will probably sign its delayed Association
Agreement with the European Union this year and may succeed in
renegotiating a natural gas supply pact with  Russia , which could
save the government about $2 billion a year, Goldman said.  Ukraine is seeking IMF aid after plunging global prices for
exports such as steel pushed its economy into recession. While
the Washington-based lender has visited the former Soviet
republic twice this year, it hasn’t agreed on a new loan because
its demands to reduce heating subsidies, make the  exchange rate 
more flexible and tighten fiscal policy haven’t been met.  GDP  contracted  1.3 percent from a year earlier in the first
quarter, state statistics data show. Growth may rebound in 2014
should the country get IMF aid this summer, according to
Matheny.  To contact the reporters on this story:
