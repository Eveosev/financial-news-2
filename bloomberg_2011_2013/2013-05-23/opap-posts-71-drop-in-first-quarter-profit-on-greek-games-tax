Opap SA (OPAP) , Greece’s biggest gambling
company, said profit in the first quarter dropped 71 percent as
a new gaming tax weighed on earnings.  Net income fell to 38.9 million euros ($50.2 million)
compared with 131.9 million euros in the same period a year
earlier, according to an Athens bourse filing today. Earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization dropped 69
percent to 57.6 million euros from 184.4 million euros a year
ago.  Sales marked an 18 percent decline to 869.3 million euros
as a sixth year of recession in the country hurt earnings. Sales
were also affected by fewer effective trading days, Athens-based
Opap said. While the economic outlook in Greece remains
“adverse”, Opap said it would stick to its target of profit of
116 million euros this year.  Greece ’s government imposed a 30 percent tax on gross
gaming revenue from this year and a tax on winnings from the
company’s games as the country strives to boost tax revenue and
meet terms set under a 240 billion-euro financial rescue from
the euro area and International Monetary Fund.  Revenue for fixed-odds sports betting game Pame Stihima
declined 27 percent to 289.8 million euros while revenue for the
Kino game dropped 11 percent to 480.8 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
