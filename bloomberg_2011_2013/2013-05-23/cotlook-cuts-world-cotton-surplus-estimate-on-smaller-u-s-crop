Cotlook Ltd. cut its forecast for the
global-cotton surplus in the year starting Aug. 1 to 1.441
million metric tons from 1.745 million last month because of
lower output in the U.S., the leading exporter.  Production will be 24.869 million tons, down from 25.133
million projected in April, Birkenhead, England-based Cotlook,
the publisher of a benchmark cotton index, said today in a
report. The U.S. harvest may yield 3.116 million tons, down from
3.365 million estimated a month earlier because of “the
persistence of drought conditions” in  Texas , the largest
producing state, the research company said.  Consumption will be 23.428 million tons, up from 23.388
million estimated in April, the data show.  China , the world’s
biggest user, will import 2.5 million tons, more than the 1.5
million forecast last month, according to the report.  The estimated surplus for next year will be down from 3.222
million in the current season, when output of 26.226 million
tons will outpace demand of 23 million tons, Cotlook said.  Cotton for July delivery fell 2 percent today to settle at
81.78 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, after
touching 81.52 cents, the lowest for a most-active contract
since Feb. 26..  To contact the reporter on this story:
