Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , continental
Europe’s biggest bank, said some investors are probably
underestimating the ramifications of the  European debt crisis 
and a political stalemate over the U.S. debt ceiling.  “The highly optimistic mood in the financial markets
indicates a risk that some market participants may be
underestimating the fiscal policy difficulties in the U.S. and
the consequences of the European debt crisis,” co-CEO  Juergen Fitschen  said in a speech to shareholders in Frankfurt today.  Global stocks have climbed in the past four weeks, boosting
market capitalization by $2.3 trillion and pushing the MSCI All-Country World Index to the highest level since 2008 amid growing
confidence in the global economy. A stock rally in the U.S. will
last at least through 2015, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecast
two days ago.  The  Stoxx 600 Europe index  dropped 2.3 percent to 303.08 at
10 a.m. in  London , the biggest decline in 10 months, on concern
the Federal Reserve will scale back stimulus measures and data
showed Chinese manufacturing was shrinking. The index gained 27
percent over the past 12 months. Contracts on the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index fell 1.1 percent.  Deutsche Bank sees “good prospects” for stabilization in
markets this year, after expectations for a recovery were
thwarted by the crisis in 2011 and 2012, Fitschen said in a
translated copy of the speech handed to reporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
