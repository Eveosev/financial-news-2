International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) 
Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge predicted earnings this
quarter will rise 8 percent from a year earlier, in line with
estimates.  The forecast suggests that  profit  will rise to about $3.79
a share in the period, excluding some items, up from $3.51 a
year earlier. That matches the average analyst  prediction ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Loughridge repeated his view that the Armonk, New York-based company’s growth in the second half of the year would be
stronger, with “double-digit performance” in the fourth
quarter.  He was speaking at the Barclays Global Technology, Media
and Telecommunications Conference in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
