Creative Group OJSC, a Ukrainian
maker of oils and margarine, will boost its 2013 earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization as much as 30
percent on improved output, the head of the company said.  “The main growth will be from processing sunflower oil,”
Chief Executive Officer Yuriy Davydov said in an interview in
his Kiev office yesterday. The company plans to increase
sunflower oil output by 37.5 percent to 440,000 tons, he said.
Creative Group’s 2012 Ebitda was $143 million, he said.  Ukraine, the world’s largest producer of sunflower seeds
and the biggest exporter of sunflower-seed oil, increased the
crop’s 2013 planting 43 percent to 2.85 million hectares (over 7
million acres) this year,  statistics  show. The country may
harvest between 8.8 million and 9.4 million tons of sunflower
seed this year, compared with 9 million tons in 2012, according
to Hamburg-based researcher  Oil World .  The share of export revenue for the company, based in
Kirovohrad, central Ukraine, will probably be unchanged in 2013
at 68 percent of total revenue or a “little higher,” Davydov
said. Last year’s revenue totaled $681 million, he said.  Creative Group, Ukraine’s third-biggest producer of bottled
sunflower oil according to its own estimates, is planning to
lower the debt-to-Ebitda ratio to under 2.5 this year from 2.54
at the end of 2012, the CEO said. The debt level will be the
same or slightly lower, he said. The company seeks to keep its
Ebitda margin at 19 percent to 20 percent, he said.  The company is planning to keep investments at about $40
million a year this and next year, compared with $168 million in
2012, Davydov said. The investments are to be used mainly for
logistics and increasing the  land bank .  Market Watching  “If the situation is favorable on the market” Creative
Group will consider the acquisition of a sunflower seed crushing
company with annual crushing capacity of 300,000 to 400,000
tons, Davydov said.  The company delayed selling Eurobonds last month because of
low market demand. It now has offers from foreign banks
including from Russian, and Ukrainian banks to refinance around
$350 million of long-term debt with a view to cut  interest
rates , according to the CEO.  Interest rates offered by the banks for what is going to be
bilateral deals are “lower than what bond investors proposed,”
Davydov said.  An initial public offering is one of the company’s main
goals and between 20 and 25 percent of shares can be sold on one
of  Europe ’s stock exchanges, Davydov said without giving a time
frame.  By Kateryna Choursina  May 23 (Bloomberg) --  To contact the reporter on this story:
