While much of the government is
shrinking because of automatic budget cuts that went into effect
in March, the Federal Reserve System’s budget is poised to
increase 8 percent in 2013 to $5.07 billion, as the central
bank’s regulatory efforts grow.  The Fed doesn’t receive appropriations from Congress and
instead funds itself through the income left over from its
monetary policy actions. The projections were released today by
the Fed in Washington as part of the central bank’s  annual
report .  “The Federal Reserve System budget is  funding  increases
for several initiatives, specifically in supervision and
monetary policy to address resource needs and for modernization
efforts in cash operations and Treasury services,” the report
said.  The Fed has been expanding its balance sheet through three
rounds of large-scale asset purchases designed to lower the 7.5
percent unemployment rate and reverse the damage from the
longest and deepest recession since the Great Depression. The
central bank has also expanded its scope due to new regulatory
authorities.  With the Fed’s  balance sheet  at an unprecedented $3.35
trillion, the central bank has earned record profits in recent
years. In 2012, the Fed paid its expenses from its earnings and
still remitted $88.4 billion back to the U.S. Treasury.  Total Expenses  The Fed’s total expenses are split between $3.69 billion
for the 12 reserve banks and $587 million for the Board of
Governors. Currency expenses for the Fed total an additional
$798 million. The $5.07 billion total is up from $4.7 billion in
2012 and $4.36 billion in 2011.  The operating expenses for the Board’s Division of Bank
Supervision and Regulation are budgeted at $102.6 million for
this year, a 10 percent rise over $92.9 million last year. The
bank supervisors have the second-largest budget at the Board of
Governors. Staff in the division is authorized to rise to 412
this year from 347 at the end of 2011.  The supervisory staff is expanding to deal with its
expanded role in financial oversight following the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. The Fed staff now performs annual stress tests on the
largest banks, and is implementing several parts of Dodd-Frank.  The documents released today also reveal the salaries
received by top central bank officials in 2012.  New York  Fed
President William C. Dudley earned $410,780 last year, according
to the report, followed by San Francisco’s John Williams who
earned $367,500.  Bernanke Salary  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s salary is set by Congress
and was $199,700 in 2012, according to the  Fed’s website .  Fed officials aren’t totally exempt from the austerity
that’s sweeping through government budgets. The report noted
that “no incumbent president and no other officers, except for
those who received a promotion with a significant increase in
responsibility, received a salary increase in 2011 or 2012, due
to the Board’s application of the pay freeze to Reserve Bank
officers.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
