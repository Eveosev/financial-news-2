New York  Yankees pitcher Hiroki Kuroda, who had the team’s best record this season, was injured
when he was hit in the calf by a line drive off the bat of the
Baltimore Orioles’ Manny Machado.  Kuroda, 38, left the game with a bruised right calf in the
third inning last night after giving up five runs on eight hits
in the Yankees’ 6-3 loss at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. He was
given the loss for a 6-3 record and 2.67 earned-run average
after entering the game with a 1.99 ERA.  The Yankees have 11 players on the disabled list, including
starting pitchers Andy Pettitte, Ivan Nova and Michael Pineda,
as well as Derek Jeter, Mark Teixeira and Alex Rodriguez.  Kuroda gave up a solo home run to Nick Markakis and a two-run homer to Chris Davis in the first inning. After Machado hit
him in the second, he came back in the third and surrendered a
double to Adam Jones and a single to Davis before being
relieved. Preston Claiborne then gave up a three-run homer to
Matt Wieters.  Robinson Cano had a run-scoring single in the third inning
for the Yankees. Curtis Granderson hit a solo home run in the
fifth and David Adams added a solo homer in the ninth inning.  Jason Hammel (6-2) allowed two runs on six hits and struck
out six in 6 2/3 innings for the Orioles (25-21), who are in
third place, three games behind the American League East-leading
Yankees (28-18).  To contact the reporter on this story:
