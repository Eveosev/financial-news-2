Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  Chief
Executive Officer Peter Sands said the U.K. bank faces an
“avalanche” of new rules set by both international and local
regulators.  The bank has “a number of challenges in the current,
really quite turbulent global economy,” Sands, 51, said today
in an interview with Bloomberg TV  Indonesia ’s Tommy Tjokro in
Jakarta. “We are facing an avalanche of regulatory changes,
some at the international level, but increasingly at the
national level. There’s a degree of fragmentation in the
regulatory agenda.”  Sands said in December 2011 the U.K.,’s bank levy and
additional regulations would cost the lender “north of $500
million” a year. The London-based firm, which gets most of its
profit in Asia, was fined $667 million by U.S. regulators last
year for breaches of U.S sanctions on  Iran .  Carson Block , the short seller who runs Muddy Waters LLC,
said in a May 10 conference he’s betting against the debt of
Standard Chartered because of the “deteriorating” quality of
the loans it has provided.  Sands said he hasn’t talked to Block and declined to
comment further other than to say he is “very comfortable about
the quality” of the bank’s loans.  Standard Chartered is the oldest bank in Indonesia, having
started operations in the country 150 years ago.  -- With assistance from Berni Moestafa and Yudith Ho in Jakarta.
