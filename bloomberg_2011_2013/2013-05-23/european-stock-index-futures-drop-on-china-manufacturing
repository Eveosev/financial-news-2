European stocks  dropped the most in
10 months after the Federal Reserve signaled it will scale back
its stimulus if the U.S. economy improves and as data showed
Chinese manufacturing shrank.  PSA Peugeot Citroen and Anglo American Plc led carmakers
and mining companies lower, respectively, on concern demand from
 China  will weaken. St. James’s Place Plc tumbled the most in 4
1/2 years after Lloyds Banking Group Plc sold 77 million shares
in the British wealth manager.  SBM Offshore NV (SBMO)  jumped to the
highest price in 13 months after saying its first-quarter
revenue increased 35 percent.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 2.1 percent to 303.99 at
the close of trading, as all but 26 of the 600 shares in the
gauge fell. The benchmark yesterday climbed to its highest level
since June 2008 as Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke initially told a
Joint Committee of Congress in  Washington  that reducing stimulus
too soon would endanger economic recovery.  “This morning, we got the perfect storm for risky assets,
with negative signals from both monetary policy and macro-fundamentals,” Witold Bahrke, who helps oversee $55 billion as
senior strategist at PFA Pension A/S in Copenhagen, wrote in a
message. “Quantitative-easing fears got boosted yesterday,
which can have quite an effect in an extremely central-bank
manipulated market.”  Later Comments  U.S. stocks  fell for a second day. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index yesterday tumbled 0.8 percent, erasing earlier gains,
as Bernanke signaled the central bank will scale back stimulus
if economic conditions improve. The flow of purchases could be
reduced “in the next few meetings” if the Fed is confident
gains in the economy can be sustained, he said in response to a
question from Representative Kevin Brady.  In Asia,  Japan ’s  Topix (TPX)  tumbled 6.9 percent today, the most
since the aftermath of the March 2011 tsunami and nuclear
disasters. The rout triggered a halt in Nikkei 225 Stock Average
futures trading in  Osaka .  A release from China showed  manufacturing  in the world’s
second-largest economy is contracting for the first time in
seven months. The preliminary reading of a purchasing managers’
index declined to 49.6 in May from 50.4 in April, HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics said. That missed the 50.4  median
estimate  in a Bloomberg News survey. Fifty is the dividing line
between expansion and contraction.  Volume Surges  The number of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600 companies
was 24 percent greater than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge’s  relative
strength index , a measure of how rapidly prices are increasing,
fell to 55 from 77 yesterday. A reading above 70 signals stocks
are rallying faster than average.  National benchmark indexes declined in all 18 western-European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 lost 2.1 percent, its
biggest drop in a year.  France ’s CAC 40 and  Germany ’s DAX also
decreased 2.1 percent each.  All 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600 fell, with gauges
of automotive and mining companies posting the worst
performances.  Peugeot, Europe’s second-largest carmaker, tumbled 5.3
percent to 6.99 euros. Renault SA lost 4 percent to 59.66 euros,
while Daimler AG slid 3.3 percent to 48.05 euros.  Anglo American, the world’s biggest platinum producer, slid
5.1 percent to 1,570 pence. Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-largest mining company, fell 4.3 percent to 2,913 pence.  Banks Drop  HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe’s biggest bank, slid 3.4 percent
to 741.8 pence, while UBS AG, Switzerland’s largest lender, lost
3.8 percent to 17.32 Swiss francs. An  index of banking shares 
slipped 3.2 percent, the most since September.  St. James’s Place plummeted 10 percent to 573 pence, the
most since October 2008. Lloyds sold 77 million shares in the
company at 580 pence a share for total proceeds of 450 million
pounds ($678 million).  Man Group Plc, the world’s biggest publicly traded hedge
fund manager, slumped 6.4 percent to 124.9 pence, its largest
drop since October. Berenberg Bank started coverage of the stock
with a sell recommendation. The brokerage said that Man’s sales
will probably remain slow and its margins will come under
pressure as its seeks funds from institutional investors.  ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) , whose chip designs power Apple Inc.’s
iPhone and iPad, plunged 5.2 percent to 995 pence. Exane BNP
Paribas downgraded the shares to neutral from outperform, saying
that Intel Corp.’s new platform may enable it to outperform
ARM’s designs.  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  lost 2.1 percent to 3,462 pence. The world’s
second-largest brewer said earnings before interest, taxes and
amortization in the year to March 31 rose to $6.42 billion. That
missed the  median estimate  of 13 analysts in a Bloomberg News
survey that called for $6.46 billion.  SBM Offshore NV rose 3.6 percent to 14.23 euros, for the
biggest gain on the Stoxx 600. The world’s largest supplier of
floating oil rigs reported a 35 percent increase in  first-quarter revenue  to $1 billion. The order portfolio increased 49
percent to a record $21 billion, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
