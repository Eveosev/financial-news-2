The U.K. markets regulator fined a
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  unit 3 million pounds ($4.5 million) for
failing to keep up-to-date records of clients and lacking risk
and compliance controls.  Senior management at JPMorgan International Bank didn’t
have “sufficient information and oversight tools” to correct
the problem in its wealth management business for two years, the
London-based  Financial Conduct Authority  said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “Customers of wealth managers should be able to expect the
firm to keep complete, up-to-date client records so that they
can give the right advice,” Tracey McDermott, director of
enforcement and financial crime at the FCA, said. “In this case
the firm did not have complete records, nor did its management
have the information they needed to recognize this.  The regulator said that the bank’s computer-based record
system didn’t hold sufficient information and that its
suitability reports didn’t have adequate statements about client
needs.  “We have fully cooperated with the FCA and have enhanced
our procedures to ensure that they are compliant with regulatory
requirements,” the bank said in an e-mailed statement. “As the
FCA has noted in its press release, there has been no detriment
to customers identified to date.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
