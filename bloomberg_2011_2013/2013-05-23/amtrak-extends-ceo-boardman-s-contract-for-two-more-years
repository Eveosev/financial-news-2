Amtrak , the U.S. intercity passenger
railroad, extended the contract of Chief Executive Officer
Joseph Boardman for another two years, with the board saying
it’s pleased with his performance.  Boardman has led the government-supported business for 4
1/2 years to record rail ridership of 31.2 million passengers
last year. The railroad announced the extension today in an e-mailed statement.  Boardman, 65, guided Amtrak’s first rail equipment
purchases since 2002 and this year proposed buying more and
faster trains to serve the U.S. Northeast. The railroad, based
in  Washington , last year reported its lowest operating loss in
almost 40 years. Boardman this year asked Congress to more than
double its capital budget so it can buy more trains and improve
infrastructure.  “We do feel very confident in him and we wanted to share
that confidence with the world,” Amtrak board chairman Tony Coscia said on a conference call today with reporters.  Before coming to Amtrak in November 2008, Boardman was the
U.S. Federal Railroad Administration head during President
George W. Bush’s administration. Congress passed a law requiring
technology known as positive-train control that can
automatically stop a train to prevent a crash, accepting
Boardman’s recommendation. He was previously  New York  state’s
transportation commissioner.  Boardman’s salary will continue to be set at $350,000 per
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
