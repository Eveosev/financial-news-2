Hong Kong  stocks  fell, with the
benchmark index headed for its biggest drop in almost seven
weeks, as a preliminary survey showed China’s manufacturing
unexpectedly contracting. Concern that the Federal Reserve will
scale back stimulus also dragged shares lower.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., slumped
2.3 percent. PetroChina Co., the country’s biggest energy
producer, declined 2.9 percent on lower  oil prices .  The Hang Seng Index slid 1.8 percent to 22,830.32 as of
10:25 a.m. in Hong Kong, headed for its steepest drop since
April 5. All but two companies fell on the 50-member gauge, with
trading volume 25 percent higher than the 30-day intraday
average. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland
companies lost 2.1 percent to 10,817, erasing the month’s gain.  Futures on the  Hang Seng Index  declined 2 percent to
22,774. The HSI Volatility Index rose 2 percent to 16.64,
indicating traders expect a swing of 4.8 percent for the equity
benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
