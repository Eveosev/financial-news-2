Mexico ’s peso fell for a third day on
growing concern the Federal Reserve will taper a stimulus
program that has boosted demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency depreciated 0.6 percent to 12.4917 per U.S.
dollar at 10:14 a.m. in Mexico City, paring its rally this year
to 2.9 percent.  The peso was the biggest loser among major Latin America
currencies as Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said yesterday that
the flow of bond purchases could be reduced “in the next few
meetings” if the U.S. central bank is confident gains in the
economy can be sustained.  “With all the liquidity we’ve seen in recent years and all
the flows that emerging-markets like Mexico have received, our
sensitivity has increased significantly,”  Rafael Camarena , an
economist at the local unit of Banco Santander SA, said in a
telephone interview from Mexico City.  Mexico’s consumer prices fell 0.35 percent in the first
half of the month, the national statistics agency said today on
its website. The median estimate of 19 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a 0.42 percent drop.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 rose 14 basis points, or
0.14 percentage point, to 5.07 percent today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 1.50 centavos to 143.14
centavos per peso.  Factory output in  China  shrank in May for the first time in
seven months, a report from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
