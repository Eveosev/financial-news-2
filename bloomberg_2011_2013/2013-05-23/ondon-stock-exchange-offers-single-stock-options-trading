London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  will
introduce trading in single-stock options next month, offering
19 contracts on energy and mining companies listed in the U.K.  The exchange’s Turquoise unit will offer to trade options
on companies from BP Plc to Rio Tinto Group from June 10,
according to an e-mailed  statement  today. The products will
clear through LSE’s LCH.Clearnet Ltd. business.  The move to trade options puts LSE in competition with NYSE
Euronext’s  Liffe  unit and  Deutsche Boerse ’s Eurex platform,
which both offer trading in U.K. options. LSE’s Chief Executive
Officer,  Xavier Rolet , is seeking to diversify the company’s
business away from traditional equities trading after losing
market share to new entrants.  “For the first time, customers will be able to trade U.K.
single-stock options through our markets, alongside existing
FTSE 100 futures and options,” Nicolas Bertrand, LSE’s head of
equity and derivatives markets, said in the statement.  LSE’s shares fell 2 percent to 1,395 pence at 2:10 p.m. in
 London  today, trimming their rally this year to 28 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
