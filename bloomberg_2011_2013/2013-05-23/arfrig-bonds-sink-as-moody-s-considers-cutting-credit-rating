Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3) ’s bonds fell the
most in five weeks after Moody’s Investors Service put the
Brazilian meatpacker’s rating under review for a reduction on
concern it’s not generating enough cash to meet debt payments.  The yield on the company’s dollar debt due in 2016 soared
1.86 percentage points to 11.75 percent at 11:12 a.m. in  Sao
Paulo , the steepest increase since April 18, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The bonds’ price fell 5.15 cents to 94.08
cents on the dollar. Shares dropped 0.5 percent to 7.43 reais
after paring a decline of as much as 2 percent.  Marfrig may have trouble paying the 3.3 billion of reais of
debt ($1.6 billion) coming  due  in the next two years as it
struggles to generate cash, Moody’s analysts including Marianna Waltz wrote in a report published after the close of trading
yesterday. The meatpacker is rated B2, five steps below
investment grade.  Marfrig last month announced plans, which include selling
South American plants, to cut its debt by $1 billion after
posting a net loss of 81.2 million reais in the first quarter.  The Sao Paulo-based meatpacker’s press office didn’t
immediately respond to a phone call from  Bloomberg News  seeking
comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
