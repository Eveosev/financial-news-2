U.S. gasoline consumption in April
dropped to the lowest level for the month in 13 years, the
 American Petroleum Institute  said.  Total deliveries of gasoline, a measure of demand, fell 3.9
percent from a year earlier to 8.47 million barrels a day, the
industry-funded group said today in a report. Year-to-date
consumption has averaged 8.38 million barrels a day, down 2.1
percent from the same period in 2012.  “The weak gasoline consumption numbers are related to the
weak economy,”  John Felmy , chief economist with the Washington-based API, said in a telephone interview. “Gasoline demand
tends to be a reflection of employment and retail sales, both of
which are anemic. There was also a rise in prices, which
probably trimmed demand.”  Total petroleum demand in April climbed 0.3 percent from a
year earlier to 18.4 million barrels a day, the API said.  Consumption of distillate fuel, a category that includes
diesel and heating oil, rose 1.4 percent to 3.76 million barrels
a day. Demand for ultra-low sulfur diesel, the type used on
highways, increased 1.3 percent to 3.47 million. Heating oil use
advanced 0.7 percent to 280,000 barrels a day.  Jet fuel consumption slipped 1.8 percent to 1.33 million
barrels a day.  “Demand for jet fuel is down because the airlines have
gotten a lot more efficient and are packing more people onto
each plane,” Felmy said.  U.S. crude-oil production increased 16 percent to 7.26
million barrels a day. Output rose 17 percent to 6.71 million in
the lower 48 states and 0.7 percent to 556,000 in  Alaska .  To contact the reporter on this story:
