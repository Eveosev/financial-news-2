Canadian Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty  said steps he took to tighten mortgage lending rules
over the past four years have helped to moderate price increases
in the nation’s housing market.  “There’s been some beneficial effect in the retail housing
market, particularly the condominium market,” Flaherty told a
committee of senators in Ottawa today. “We’ve seen a softening
in demand, in the condominium market for sure in Canadian big
cities. This is a good thing. I welcome this. We don’t have a
bubble.”  The central bank has indicated the policy rate is unlikely
to rise “for some time,” which is a “persisting problem”
because it leads to residential  mortgage rates  being so low that
people may take on debts they can’t afford, he said. Still,
Canadians are keeping up with credit card payments, Flaherty
said.  “On credit card payments, people paying their credit cards
on time has gone up, and that’s a good thing,” the finance
minister said.  The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions
will continue to monitor Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. “very
closely,” because it’s become a “major financial institution”
and needs to operate like one, Flaherty said.  OSFI “has been over there doing some stress testing, and
we’re going to continue monitoring CMHC very closely,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
