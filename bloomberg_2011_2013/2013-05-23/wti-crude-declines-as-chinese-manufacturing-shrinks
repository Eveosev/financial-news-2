West Texas Intermediate oil fell for
a third day as Chinese manufacturing contracted and speculation
mounted that the Federal Reserve will cut bond purchases.  Futures dropped as much as 2.2 percent after a preliminary
reading of  China ’s Purchasing Managers Index slipped to 49.6 for
May, the lowest since October and less than forecast. Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke signaled yesterday that the central
bank may reduce the monthly acquisition known as quantitative
easing. A government report yesterday showed that U.S. gasoline
supplies rose  3.02 million barrels  last week.  “The Chinese manufacturing number was a huge blow,” said
John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based
hedge fund that focuses on energy. “China is the swing oil
demand center, much like Saudi Arabia is the swing producer, and
what happens there is of outsize importance. We might see a
correction because this will cut demand while supply grows.”  WTI crude for July delivery fell $1.49, or 1.6 percent, to
$92.79 a barrel at 10:39 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. Futures dropped to $92.21, the lowest level since May
15. The volume of all contracts traded was 36 percent above the
100-day average.  Brent oil for July settlement declined $1.33, or 1.3
percent, to $101.27 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.
Volume for all contracts was 9 percent lower than the 100-day
average. The European benchmark grade traded at a $8.48 premium
to WTI.  Manufacturing Index  The China manufacturing index for May released today by
 HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and Markit Economics showed the first
contraction in seven months. It’s below a median estimate of
50.4 in a Bloomberg survey of economists, which was also the
final measure for April. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  The Chinese economic figures also sent equities lower. The
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  dropped 0.8 percent and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average 0.5 percent.  Bernanke said yesterday the Fed may taper its $85 billion a
month of purchases if confident of a sustained improvement in
the U.S. economy.  The Fed said May 1 it will keep buying bonds at the monthly
pace of $85 billion, while standing ready to raise or lower
purchases as conditions evolve. The Bank of  Japan  and Bank of
England have also purchased assets to bolster economic growth
while the European Central Bank cut interest rates to a record
low on May 2.  Stimulus Concern  “We’re down on concerns about the slowdown of stimulus by
the Fed,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research
at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The reason oil
has been higher all year has been due to quantitative easing and
other much measures. Now prices should drop to a level supported
by demand.”  The drop in prices occurred after the oil market failed to
breach key technical resistance at $97.17 a barrel, the high
touched on May 6, Armstrong said.  “We’ve formed a double top at $97.17 and should now
retrace at least to $90,” Armstrong said.  U.S.  crude supplies  slipped 338,000 barrels to 394.6
million last week, the Energy Information Administration said
yesterday. A 1 million-barrel decline was forecast in Bloomberg
survey. Stockpiles climbed to 395.5 million in the week ended
May 3, the most since 1931, according to the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical unit.  Crude supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
WTI, rose 449,000 barrels to 50.2 million in the week ended May
17, yesterday’s EIA report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
