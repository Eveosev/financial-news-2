The  Chicago Board Options Exchange 
and the CME Group Inc. started an index that measures the pace
of projected swings in U.S. 10-year Treasury futures.  The volatility index, based on options on the CME Group’s
10-year Treasury note futures, will be calculated and
disseminated by the CBOE to gauge the expected level of swings
in long-term Treasuries as signaled by the options market. More
than 56 million options contracts on 10-year Treasury note
futures traded last year on CME, the world’s largest futures
exchange, according to a note published today.  As well as being CME’s most active interest-rate options,
“interest-rate derivatives also represent the largest asset
class in the over-the-counter market,” Richard Dufour, an
executive vice president at the CBOE, wrote in the note. “We
believe this CBOE/CBOT Volatility Index will serve as a strong
benchmark to help our global customers manage their exposure to
market volatility.”  CBOT, as the Chicago Board of Trade is known, is a CME
Group exchange on which Treasury futures and options are traded.  The CBOE in coordination with the CBF, a futures exchange
also among firms held by  CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE) , plans to eventually
offer trading on the new volatility index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
