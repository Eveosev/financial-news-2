Pegas Nonwovens SA, a Czech maker of
non woven textiles used in construction, automotive and medical
industries, said first-quarter net slumped 66% on currency
swings.  Net income for the three months ended March 31 fell to 3
million euros ($3.9 million) from 8.7 million euros, the  Czech
Republic , Znojmo-based company said in a statement today.
Revenue rose 13 percent to 49.9 million euros.  The koruna rate against the euro and changes linked to
revaluation of balance sheet items denominated in euros resulted
in 3 million euros expense in the period, compared with a gain
of 5.2 million a year earlier, the company said in the
statement.  Ebitda, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization rose 6 percent to 10.1 million euros in the first
quarter, it said.  “Our entry into 2013 has been very good,” Chief Executive
Officer Fratisek Rezac said in the statement. “We have not only
been successful in booking all of our production but over the
course of the previous quarter we also managed to significantly
lower our inventory levels.”  The construction of a  production line  in  Egypt  is
proceeding as scheduled and Pegas expects to start it in the
third quarter of this year, it said.  Pegas reiterated its 2013 forecast for Ebitda to grow
between 5 percent to 15 percent from 38.1 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
