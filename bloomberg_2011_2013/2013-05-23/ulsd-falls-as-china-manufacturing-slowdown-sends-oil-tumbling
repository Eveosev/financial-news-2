Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fell as a
slowdown in  China ’s manufacturing sent oil tumbling and raised
concern that global demand for distillates will decline.  ULSD slid along with the U.S. and  London  benchmark crudes
after China’s manufacturing contracted in May for the first time
in seven months, indicating slowing economic growth in the
world’s second-largest energy consumer. Gasoil slid in Europe,
reducing the incentive to export distillates to that region.  “China’s growth, the minute it starts to disappear, the
longs who have piled into the market have to think if they want
to expose themselves to risk,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst
and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for June delivery fell 4.03 cents,
or 1.4 percent, to $2.8333 a gallon at 9:49 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange on trading volume that was 37 percent above
the 100-day average for the time of day.  July ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate
crude oil shrank by 1.5 cents to $26.19 a barrel. July ULSD’s
 premium over Brent  fell 24 cents to $17.64 a barrel.  Gasoil for delivery in June on the ICE Futures Exchange in
London declined $18.25 to $848.50 a metric ton.  Gasoline for June delivery slid 1.8 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $2.8014 a gallon on trading volume that was 5 percent above
the 100-day average for the time of day.  Futures dropped as much as 1 percent following an Energy
Information Administration report showing that supplies of the
motor fuel gained 3.02 million barrels in the week ended May 17,
the most since April 12. A Bloomberg survey predicted a drop of
300,000 barrels.  The fuel’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 96 cents to
$24.79 a barrel. July gasoline’s  premium  over July Brent rose 64
cents to $16.15.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.1 cent to
$3.659 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the nation’s
largest motoring organization, said today on its website. Prices
are 1.9 cents below a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
