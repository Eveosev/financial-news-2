TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  won another of the
remaining  Texas  state-court challenges by landowners trying to
block construction of the Keystone XL tar-sands pipeline across
their property.  A state appeals court in Beaumont, Texas, denied a bid by
David Holland and his partners in a southeast Texas rice farm to
overturn a lower-court order that let TransCanada install its
pipeline before the landowners’ appeals were completed.  Holland challenged Keystone’s status as a common carrier,
with the right to use eminent domain statutes to condemn an
easement across his land. He argued that a 2012 Texas Supreme
Court decision required the pipeline to prove it was a common
carrier before it could take possession of the land through
eminent domain.  The three-judge appellate panel, in a unanimous ruling
today, said the state high-court decision didn’t apply to the
specific statute TransCanada used to access eminent domain in
this case. Under the Texas Property Code, TransCanada could
proceed before appeals were done, the judges said.  TransCanada, based in Calgary, has been fighting court
challenges from a handful of landowners who object to the
Keystone XL’s route in East Texas. This portion of the pipeline,
which connects Beaumont with Cushing,  Oklahoma , forms the
southernmost leg of a 2,151-mile (3,461-kilometer) system that
will carry tar-sands crude from western  Canada  to refineries on
the Texas Gulf coast.  The case is In Re Texas Rice Land Partners Ltd.,
09-12-00484, Court of Appeals, Ninth District of Texas
(Beaumont).  To contact the reporter on this story:
