U.S.  nuclear-power generation  rose to
an 11-week high after reactors in  Massachusetts ,  New Jersey  and
 Maryland  returned to service.  Nationwide production rose  0.9 percent  to 84,982 megawatts,
or 83 percent of capacity, the most since March 9, according to
Nuclear Regulatory Commission data compiled by Bloomberg. Output
was  3.4 percent higher  than a year ago with 14 of 104 plants
offline.  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG)  started the 1,174-megawatt Salem 1 reactor in New Jersey after shutting it for
more than five weeks for refueling and planned maintenance. The
unit, about 18 miles south of Wilmington,  Delaware , was
operating at 2 percent of capacity today.  Constellation Energy Group Inc. began generation at the
862-megawatt Calvert Cliffs 2 reactor, about 38 miles south of
Annapolis. The reactor, which today operated at 3 percent of
capacity, tripped offline on May 21 because of equipment failure
associated with the steam generator feed pump, according to the
NRC.  The 685-megawatt Pilgrim 1 reactor owned by  Entergy Corp. (ETR) 
restarted and was operating at 1 percent of capacity. The unit,
about 4 miles east of Plymouth, Massachusetts, had been shut
since mid-April.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The
average refueling down time was 46 days in 2012, according to
the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
