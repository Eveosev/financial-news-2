SAIC Motor Corp. (600104) ,  China ’s largest
automaker, will resume delivery of its electric Roewe E50 at
prices based on government subsidies that ended last year.  The Shanghai-based  carmaker  introduced the battery-powered
car in November and sold about 200 units before government
rebates for so-called new-energy vehicles expired. While state-owned SAIC stopped delivering the model this year, it has
continued taking orders, said Judy Zhu, a spokeswoman.  “Consumers have been waiting quite long for the cars, we
feel that we shouldn’t let them wait so long,” Zhu said by
telephone yesterday.  SAIC’s move signals anticipation among automakers that
China may announce new policies on subsidies for new-energy
vehicles, after a three-year trial program was allowed to lapse.
The government has formulated new measures that will last
through at least 2015 and will backdate the incentives to the
start of this year, the China Securities Journal reported
yesterday, without saying how it got the information.  The Roewe E50 costs about 128,000  yuan  ($21,000) after
94,000 yuan in subsidies from the central and  Shanghai 
governments, said David Zhang, chief executive of TZGEV Ltd.,
which distributes electric vehicles in Shanghai.  Orders for electric vehicles at TZGEV have declined by
about 20 percent this year to about 300 units for various brands
after the subsidies ended, according to Zhang.  In Shanghai, buyers of electric cars are also exempt from
auctioning for license plates, which exceeded 90,000 yuan this
year.  To contact Bloomberg News
