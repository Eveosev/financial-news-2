The law firm of the trustee
liquidating the Lehman Brothers Inc. brokerage asked a judge to
approve fees and expenses of $37.5 million for the period from
July 1 through February 28.  A bankruptcy judge previously approved $212.7 million in
fees and expenses for James Giddens and the law firm of Hughes
Hubbard & Reed LLP for the four-and-a-half years since September
2008, according to a federal court filing in Manhattan
yesterday. Giddens hasnâ€™t yet told brokerage customers when they
will be paid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
