The Swiss franc rose the most against
the euro since the day before the central bank imposed its cap
on the currency in 2011 as the prospect of a reduction in U.S.
monetary stimulus boosted demand for haven assets.  The franc strengthened against all but one of its 16 major
peers as stocks slid around the world after a report showed
Chinese manufacturing unexpectedly contracted.  Switzerland ’s
currency, which yesterday weakened through 1.26 per euro for the
first time since May 2011, is sought as a haven at times of
heightened global stress, according to a Swiss National Bank
study published last month. The  Federal Reserve  may slow monthly
bond purchases, Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday.  “Bernanke’s comments turned markets to a risk-off mode and
are pushing investors toward haven currencies,” Peter Rosenstreich, chief foreign-exchange analyst at Swissquote Bank
SA in Geneva, said in a telephone interview.  The Swiss franc advanced as much as 1.3 percent to 1.2420
per euro, the biggest gain since Sept. 5, 2011, the day before
the SNB set a cap of 1.20 francs per euro to ward off deflation
and a recession. It was at 1.2462 at 12:34 p.m Zurich time.
Against the dollar it climbed 1.1 percent to 96.75 centimes.  The franc slumped yesterday, when SNB President Thomas Jordan said that a shift of the limit on the euro exchange rate
was in the SNB’s toolkit.  While Jordan’s comments raised the level of uncertainty on
what the SNB would do next, “the market got ahead of itself”
in expecting a move from the central bank, said Rosenstreich.  To contact the reporter on this story:
