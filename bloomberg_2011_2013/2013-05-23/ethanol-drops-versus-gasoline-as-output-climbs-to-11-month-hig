Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened a day after a government report showed production of the
biofuel climbed to the highest level in 11 months.  The spread, or price difference, expanded 2.77 cents to
20.11 cents a gallon, a day after an Energy Information
Administration report showed  production  last week gained 2.1
percent to 875,000 barrels a day, the most since June 22, aided
by cheaper manufacturing costs.  “The production margin has been improving, so it was
expected that we would see some pick-up in output,” said
Beatriz Pupo, a Montreal-based analyst at Kingsman SA, a sugar
and biofuels research firm in Lausanne, Switzerland.  Denatured ethanol for June delivery fell 1.9 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.627 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 23 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for June delivery gained 0.87 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.8281 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  The biofuel also declined on speculation that ethanol’s
narrowing discount to gasoline this year will curb refiner
demand, said Jim Damask, a manager at StarFuels Inc. in Jupiter,
 Florida .  Ethanol traded as much as 78.76 cents cheaper than gasoline
as recently as Feb. 14.  “It matters,” Damask said. “It’s the blending economics
for the refiner.”  Gasoline Supply  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 94 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline supply, down from 95 percent the previous
week and the smallest amount since April 19, EIA data show.  Corn for July delivery rose 3.5 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$6.62 a bushel in Chicago.  The corn crush spread for July was 9 cents, down from 12
cents yesterday and compared with minus 35 cents on Dec. 31. The
amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can
be fed to livestock.  Corn-based ethanol Renewable Identification Numbers, or
RINs, for 2013 fell 1.2 percent to 88.13 cents as of 4:37 p.m.
New York time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs,
which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol,
rose 0.2 percent to 98.36 cents.  Stockpile Declines  Below-average production this year has helped deplete
stockpiles of the fuel. Inventories last week fell 1.5 percent
to 16.2 million barrels, the lowest level since Nov. 5, 2010, a
report from the EIA, the Energy Department’s analytical arm,
showed yesterday.  The U.S. hasn’t  imported  any ethanol since April 19, EIA
data show, the longest streak since March 2012.  Pupo said that may change as cheaper sugar makes Brazilian
supplies of the biofuel more competitive.  Anhydrous ethanol in Sao Paulo cost $2.53 a gallon last
week, down 2.1 percent from the week ended May 10, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf increased
3 cents to $2.75 a gallon and in  Chicago  climbed 1.5 cents to
$2.64, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In New York the
additive slipped 2 cents to $2.74 and on the West Coast prices
dropped 1.5 cents to $2.77 a gallon.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the Gulf shrank 4.5 cents
to 2 cents, while Chicago’s  discount  to New York Harbor narrowed
3.5 cents to 10 cents, the lowest level since May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
