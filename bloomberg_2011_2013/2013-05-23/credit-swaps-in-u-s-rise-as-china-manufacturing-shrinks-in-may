A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
rose as data showed  China ’s manufacturing is contracting in May
for the first time in seven months.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, increased
1.8 basis points to a mid-price of 73.5 basis points at 8:10
a.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
measure has increased for three of the last four days.  A preliminary reading of China’s  Purchasing Managers ’ Index
fell to 49.6 in May, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said
today. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. Signs of
faltering world growth may trigger concern that U.S. firms will
face difficulty repaying debt maturities.  The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
