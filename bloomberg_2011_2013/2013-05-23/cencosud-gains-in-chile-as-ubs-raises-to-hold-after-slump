UBS AG ended its sell rating on
 Cencosud SA (CENCOSUD) ,  Chile ’s largest retailer by sales, saying the stock
price’s 14 percent drop from an 11-month high in March already
reflected increased risks to Argentine operations.  UBS raised its rating to the equivalent of hold and kept
the price target unchanged at 2,900 pesos a share. The stock
rose 0.1 percent today to 2,624.3 pesos at the close in
Santiago. The benchmark Chilean Ipsa index retreated 0.8
percent.  In Argentina, “the macro situation is still challenging
with price freezes, high inflation, rising labor costs” among
other risks, Gustavo Piras Oliveira, an analyst at UBS, wrote in
a note today. Even so, the stock is “already pricing in a sharp
deterioration of results.”  Argentina accounted for 26 percent of Santiago-based
Cencosud’s revenue in the fourth quarter, according to its most
recent filing to Chile’s securities regulator. Cencosud’s shares
have retreated 9.4 percent in the last three months, while its
peer  SACI Falabella (FALAB)  has increased 1 percent in the same period
and department store operator  Ripley Corp SA (RIPLEY)  has fallen 8.7
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
