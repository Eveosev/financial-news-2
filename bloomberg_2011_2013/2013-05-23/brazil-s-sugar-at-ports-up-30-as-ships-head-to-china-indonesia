The amount of sugar awaiting loading
at ports in top producer  Brazil  rose 30 percent in a week as
vessels head for China,  Indonesia , Algeria and Bangladesh,
according to Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda.  Sugar waiting to be loaded onto ships at Recife, Maceio,
Paranagua and Santos, the country’s biggest port, totaled 1.35
million metric tons, figures e-mailed yesterday from the Recife,
Brazil-based shipping agency showed. That compares with about
1.04 million tons a week earlier.  Vessels scheduled to go to China were set to take 128,950
tons of the sweetener, while those bound for Indonesia would
carry 112,723 tons, the data show. Ships headed for Algeria were
set to take 110,499 tons and Bangladesh would get 100,000 tons,
according to the shipping agency.  China  was the world’s biggest
raw sugar importer last season and Indonesia is forecast to be
the top buyer this year.  Raw sugar for delivery in July was little changed at 16.67
cents a pound by 5:51 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
