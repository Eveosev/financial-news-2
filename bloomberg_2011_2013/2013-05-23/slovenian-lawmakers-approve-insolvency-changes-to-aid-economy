Slovenian lawmakers approved changes
to the country’s insolvency legislation designed to accelerate
corporate restructuring and aid the ailing banking industry.  Lawmakers voted for changes the government said will lower
the debt burden at companies and spur an economic recovery,
according to a live broadcast on public broadcaster TV Slovenija
in the capital Ljubljana. The overhaul is supported by the
central bank, which said in February previous legislation
allowed owners to drag out the insolvency process, causing an
“unnecessary” wave of bankruptcies that in turn affected
banks’ business.  Slovenian banks, including Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d., the
nation’s largest, are struggling with bad loans that represent
almost a fifth of the nation’s total output as the government
pushes forward an economic overhaul meant to reassure investors
and the European Union the country can make it without outside
assistance.  Banks in the Adriatic nation will transfer bad loans to the
bank asset-management company starting next month to help clean
up their balance sheets.  Slovenia’s export-dependent  economy , in its second
recession since 2009, will shrink this year and next before
recovering in 2015, according to the forecast by the European
Commission. Gross domestic product will contract an annual 2
percent and 0.1 percent next year, the European Union’s
executive arm said in a May 3 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
