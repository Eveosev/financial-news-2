Canadian  stocks  fell for the first
time in five days amid a global equity selloff as China’s
manufacturing industry unexpectedly contracted.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , Canada’s largest diversified miner,
and First Quantum Minerals Ltd. fell at least 2.8 percent as
base metal prices declined.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  lost 0.6 percent
as crude retreated for a third day. Toronto-Dominion Bank,
Canada’s second-largest bank, dropped 0.5 percent after
reporting adjusted earnings that missed estimates. Kirkland Lake
Gold Inc. and Kinross Gold Corp. rallied more than 1.9 percent
as gold snapped two days of losses.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 94.41
points, or 0.7 percent, to 12,658.09 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
benchmark equity gauge has gained 1.8 percent this year. Trading
was 15 percent below the 30-day average.  “Manufacturing data tells you a lot about where markets
are going, and they’ve been weak for some time,” said  John Stephenson , a fund manager with First Asset Investment
Management Inc. in Toronto. Stephenson helps manage C$2.7
billion ($2.6 billion) at the firm. “Seeing the slowdown in the
China data confirms that. It’s a negative for stocks.”  China manufacturing is contracting in May for the first
time in seven months. The preliminary reading of 49.6 for a
 Purchasing Managers ’ Index released today by HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics compares with a final 50.4 for April and
the 50.4 median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. A reading
above 50 indicates expansion.  Global Stocks  The MSCI All-Country World Index slumped 1.3 percent for
the biggest decline since April.  Japan ’s Topix Index plunged 6.9
percent, the most since March 2011. The  S&P 500  lost 0.3
percent.  “It’s a combination of the China data and the reaction
that’s happening in the rest of the world,” Anish Chopra, a
 fund manager  with TD Asset Management Ltd., said from Toronto.
He helps manage C$204 billion with the firm. “Japan has fallen
quite a bit and it’s rippled through the rest of the markets
worldwide. The Japanese equity market has been up substantially
year-to-date, so a pullback seems reasonable.”  All 10 groups in the S&P/TSX fell, with industrial and
health-care stocks dropping at least 1.2 percent.  Teck Resources dropped 4.3 percent to C$28.20 and First
Quantum slid 2.8 percent to C$18.69 as raw-materials producers
declined 0.9 percent as a group. Copper, used in building
construction, fell 2.3 percent to settle at $3.304 a pound in
New York, the biggest decline since May 1. Aluminum, nickel,
lead, tin and zinc prices were also lower in  London .  Oil Slides  Suncor,  Canada ’s largest oil producer by market value, lost
0.6 percent to C$32.32. Athabasca Oil Corp. dropped 2.7 percent
to C$6.42 and Penn West Petroleum Ltd. fell 2.1 percent to
C$10.14. The price of crude retreated 3 cents to settle at
$94.25 a barrel in New York, paring earlier losses of as much as
2.2 percent.  TD Bank dropped 0.5 percent to C$83.65 after reporting
adjusted second-quarter earnings of C$1.90 a share, missing the
C$1.91 average estimate of 13  analysts  compiled by Bloomberg.  Kirkland Lake Gold rallied 5.7 percent to C$4.46 and
Kinross Gold Corp. climbed 1.9 percent to C$6.02. The precious
metal’s price advanced 1.8 percent to settle at $1,391.80 an
ounce in  New York , the biggest gain since April 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
