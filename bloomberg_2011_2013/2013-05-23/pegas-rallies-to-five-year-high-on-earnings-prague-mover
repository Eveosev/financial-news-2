Pegas Nonwovens SA, a Czech maker of
textiles used for diapers and furniture, jumped to a five-year
high after its first-quarter revenue and profit increased.  The shares climbed 12.6 koruna, or 2.3 percent, to 547
koruna in  Prague , advancing to the highest level since April
2008 and extending this year’s gain to 13 percent.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose 6 percent to 10.1 million euros ($13 million)
in the first quarter while revenue increased 13 percent to 49.9
million euros, the Czech Republic, Znojmo-based company said in
a regulatory statement today.  “The results were above expectations,” Ceska Sporitelna
analyst Josef Novotny in Prague said in a note. “Ebitda was
positively affected by higher sales of finished products as well
as sales of inventories accumulated in prior periods and also by
an increase in polymer prices.”  Pegas maintained its forecast for Ebitda to grow from 5
percent to 15 percent this year, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
