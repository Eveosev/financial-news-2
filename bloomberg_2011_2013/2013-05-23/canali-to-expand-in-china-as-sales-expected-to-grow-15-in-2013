Canali Holding SpA, the Italian
menswear retailer, expects sales in  China  to grow 15 percent
this year as the company expands its footprint in the world’s
second-largest economy.  The closely-held retailer, whose sales also grew 15 percent
in 2012, plans to open five new boutiques across China to tap
the rising income of the Chinese consumers.  While the growth in the Chinese economy “is slowing a
little bit, it will be one of the most important markets for
us,” Stefano Canali, Canali’s group general manager, said today
in an interview in Hong Kong where the company has opened a
flagship store.  The Italian clothier, whose 60 outlets in China include
stores by the iconic Shanghai Bund and Beijing Season Place, is
expanding in the country as rising incomes boost consumer
purchases. Men’s clothing market in China may grow 15 percent
annually over the three years from 58 billion  yuan  in 2012, as
more males get fashion conscious, according to industry analyst
Mintel Group Ltd.  Greater China , which accounts for 17 percent of the group
sales, is the company’s second-largest market after the U.S.
which makes up 27 percent, Canali said. It will take China at
least 10 years to to overtake the U.S. market, the executive
said.  Canali, which gets about a fifth of its sales from the Asia
Pacific region, posted a turnover of 210 million euros ($270
million) last year, according to data from the company.  Slowing economic growth is weighing on luxury purchases on
the mainland this year. Luxury sales will rise about 7 percent
in the Asian nation in 2013, about a third of last year’s rate,
Bain & Co. estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
