The rand weakened to its longest
losing streak in 25 years as manufacturing in China, the biggest
buyer of South African raw materials, probably slowed and as
labor unrest ignited concern about growth before the Reserve
Bank’s rate decision.  The worst-performing emerging-market currency this year
depreciated for an 11th day and traded at its weakest level
against the dollar on a closing basis since March 2009 after
about 10,000 South African textile workers said yesterday they
went on strike and after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said a premature withdrawal of stimulus could endanger
the U.S. recovery as policy makers debated scaling back the pace
of its bond purchase program. Investec Asset Management said the
rand may weaken to 9.86 per dollar in the short term before
rebounding, without giving a time frame.  “Currencies are being driven by the stronger dollar on the
view that the Fed will start tapering later this year,”
Vivienne Taberer, who helps manage about $14 billion in
emerging-market debt and currencies at Investec Asset
Management, said in e-mailed comments. The rand’s weakening is
“overdone” and its “positioning is getting stretched,” she
said. The currency may strengthen to 9.30 in the medium term,
she said.  The rand, which lost 12 percent this year, slipped 0.3
percent to 9.5965 by 1:52 p.m. in Johannesburg. Yields on South
Africa’s benchmark 10.5 percent rand bonds due December 2026
rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.06
percent.  Work Stoppages  Labor unrest has flared up in Africa’s largest economy this
month, with a two-day work stoppage at  Lonmin Plc (LMI) ’s Marikana
operations following the assassination of an Association of
Mineworkers and Construction Union official on May 11. Members
of the Southern African Clothing & Textile Union downed tools in
the southeastern KwaZulu-Natal province for two days from May 21
demanding higher wages.  Seven people, including two shot by rubber bullets, were
injured in clashes between workers and security personnel over
annual performance-related payments at  Lanxess AG (LXS) ’s chrome unit
near Rustenburg in North West province yesterday.  China’s manufacturing probably contracted in May for the
first time in seven months, supporting the view that the
country’s economic growth is losing steam for a second quarter.
The preliminary reading of 49.6 for a  Purchasing Managers’ Index (EC11FLAS) 
released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
compares with a final 50.4 for April and the 50.4 median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. A reading above 50
indicates expansion. China is the biggest buyer of South African
raw materials.  Interest Rate  Reserve Bank Governor  Gill Marcus  will announce South
African  interest rates  today, with 19 of 20 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg expecting the rate to be held at a 30-year low of 5
percent.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index dropped 2 percent, poised
for the biggest slide in 10 months. The  FTSE/JSE Africa All-Share Index (JALSH)   fell  1.7 percent, the most since April 15 on an
intraday basis.  “Bernanke’s comments to Congress have hit the markets
badly,”  John Cairns , a currency strategist at  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) ’s
Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said in a note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
