Lithuania ’s budget deficit has become
a bigger hurdle than inflation to adopting the euro in 2015 as
economic growth slows and tax collection falters, central bank
Deputy Chairman Raimondas Kuodis said.  “The main obstacle, as we now see it, is the budget,”
Kuodis told reporters today in Vilnius, the capital, citing
“serious problems with value-added tax collection” this year
and high rates of  tax evasion .  Economic growth will slow more than previously estimated
this year to 2.8 percent, from 3.7 percent in 2012, the central
bank said today. As a result, “the risk is very big” that the
fiscal gap won’t shrink below the euro-adoption limit of 3
percent of gross domestic product, central bank economist Ruta
Rodzko said at the same news conference.  Lithuania is set to become the last of the three Baltic
countries to join the euro region, with Estonia making the
switch in 2011 and  Latvia  planning to follow suit next year. An
inflation limit that was seen as Lithuania’s main challenge to
qualify for the currency bloc is now within reach, Rodzko said.  The central bank now sees this year’s average inflation
rate falling to 2 percent, from 3.2 percent in 2012.  The 2013 government budget adopted in December is based on
a forecast of 3 percent GDP growth, with plans to cut the
deficit to 2.5 percent of economic output from 3.2 percent last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
