A former  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
investment banker will pay $100,000 to resolve U.S. regulatory
claims that he made improper contributions to a Massachusetts
treasurer while seeking state underwriting business.  Neil Morrison, who worked on then-Treasurer  Tim Cahill ’s
unsuccessful run for governor from November 2008 to October 2010
while he was employed by Goldman Sachs, also agreed to be barred
from the securities industry for five years, the Securities and
Exchange Commission said in a statement today.  “These tough sanctions against Morrison show that we take
abuses of the pay-to-play rules in the municipal securities
industry very seriously and will hold individuals accountable
for their violations,” Elaine Greenberg, head of the SEC
enforcement division’s municipal securities unit, said in a
statement.  Goldman Sachs in September agreed to pay about $14 million
to resolve the SEC’s claims. Morrison, who was fired by Goldman
Sachs in December 2010, and the New York-based bank settled
without admitting or denying wrongdoing.  “We certainly agree with Ms. Greenberg of the SEC that
these sanctions are tough,” said Tom Kiley, Morrison’s
attorney. “The fact that this is the first time there has been
an industry bar for a violation of the pay-to-play rule is a
pretty good indication the law wasn’t clear at the time of the
conduct.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
