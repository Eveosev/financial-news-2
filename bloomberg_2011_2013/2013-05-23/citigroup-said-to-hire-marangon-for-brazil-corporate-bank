Citigroup Inc. (C) , the  U.S. bank  that
sold its Credicard unit in Brazil last week, hired Marcelo Marangon, a former executive director of Banco Itau BBA SA, to
lead its corporate bank in the country, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  The discussions with Marangon, who spent 15 years at
Citigroup earlier in his career, have been under way since he
left Sao Paulo-based Itau BBA in the middle of April, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the hiring hasn’t
been announced yet.  Marangon, the former head of global banking in Brazil for
 HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , was hired by Itau in October 2011 to handle a
newly created unit catering to large corporations. He left Itau
amid a restructuring that included management changes. Banco
Itau BBA is the wholesale arm of Itau Unibanco Holding SA, the
biggest Latin American bank by market value.  Before HSBC, Marangon was head of corporate banking and
corporate finance at Citigroup. He was also a consultant at
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  In March 2011, Citigroup hired Itau’s former head of
 investment banking , Andre Kok, to lead global banking for
Brazil.  Marangon and Citigroup declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
