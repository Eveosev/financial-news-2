European Central Bank Governing
Council member Jens Weidmann expressed discomfort with the  Bank
of Japan ’s monetary-policy stance.  “I wish the Japanese good luck in their experiments,”
Weidmann, who also heads  Germany ’s Bundesbank, said in Paris
last night. “We see that monetary policy can be pushed into a
very difficult spot.”  In a plan to battle deflation, the Bank of  Japan  on April 4
announced a doubling of its monthly bond purchases and set a
two-year horizon for achieving inflation of 2 percent. Governor
Haruhiko Kuroda said this week he may adjust the unprecedented
stimulus program, which will expand the supply of money by 60
trillion to 70 trillion yen ($688 billion) a year, after a jump
in bond yields highlighted risks.  “The Japanese central bank buys 70 percent of the
emissions of the government, I am just telling you, I am not
commenting,” said Weidmann, who has also criticized the ECB’s
pledge to buy  government bonds  if certain conditions are met.  “What concerns me” is “not fully visible yet,” he said,
adding he’s worried that monetary policy is being asked to solve
Japan’s problems at the expense of fiscal and structural
reforms.  “I’m not saying this is what is happening. This is my
concern.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
