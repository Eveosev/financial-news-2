Swiss stocks  plunged the most in six
months as equities fell around the world amid concern the
 Federal Reserve  will scale back its bond purchases, while a
report showed Chinese manufacturing contracted.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, the owner of the Cartier
brand, posted the biggest decline on the benchmark  Swiss Market
Index. (SMI)   UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Switzerland’s two
largest banks, fell more than 2.5 percent.  Logitech
International SA (LOGN) , the world’s biggest maker of computer mice,
rose 2.8 percent after its chief executive officer announced a
dividend and gave sales forecasts that exceeded estimates.  The SMI slid 2.7 percent to 8,178.68 at 3:10 p.m. in
Zurich, its largest plunge since Nov. 1. The equity benchmark
rose to its highest level since December 2007 yesterday. The
gauge has  rallied 20 percent  so far in 2013, its best start to a
year since 1998. The broader Swiss Performance Index lost 2.6
percent today.  “This is a correction within a  bull market ; now the
question is how many days can it last?” said Luis Benguerel, a
trader at Interbrokers Espanola de Valores in Barcelona.
“Investors should at one point see this as an opportunity to
add positions in equities.”  The Swiss franc strengthened the most against the euro
since the day before the central bank imposed its cap on the
currency in 2011 as the prospect of a reduction in U.S. monetary
stimulus boosted demand for haven assets. The Swiss franc
advanced as much as 1.3 percent to 1.2420 per euro, the biggest
gain since Sept. 5, 2011.  Volume Jumps  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 52 percent greater than the daily average of the past 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.8 percent yesterday
after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled that the U.S.
central bank will scale back stimulus if the recovery improves.
Bernanke made the comments in testimony to the Joint Economic
Committee of Congress in  Washington .  Switzerland’s exporters fell after a report showed China’s
manufacturing output shrank for the first time in seven months.
The preliminary reading for May of 49.6 for the purchasing
managers’ index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics compared with a final 50.4 for April. The number
missed the 50.4  median estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of 13
analysts. A reading below 50 means activity contracted.  Richemont, which also owns  Alfred Dunhill , declined 4.8
percent to 88.35 Swiss francs, the biggest slide in four months.
Swatch Group AG, the biggest maker of Swiss watches, retreated 3
percent to 575.50 francs.  ABB Ltd. (ABBN) , the world’s largest maker of
power transformers, fell 3 percent to 21.38 francs.  UBS Slides  UBS,  Switzerland’s largest bank , dropped 3.5 percent to
17.37 francs. Credit Suisse, the second-biggest, decreased 2.5
percent to 28.41 francs.  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER) , Switzerland’s
third-largest wealth manager, fell 3 percent to 38.30 francs.  Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN)  declined 1.2 percent to 159.40
francs, its first drop in four days, even as Switzerland’s
biggest life insurer said its premiums climbed 14 percent in the
first quarter. Gross premiums rose to 6.97 billion francs ($7.2
billion) from 6.11 billion francs a year earlier, the Zurich-based company said in a statement. The shares had  surged 33
percent  this year before today.  Logitech added 2.8 percent to 6.60 francs. The company
plans to pay a recurring annual dividend starting this year and
may consider buybacks, CEO Bracken Darrell said at an investor
day. The company said it will pay a  dividend  of 21 centimes a
share. Logitech also forecast sales of $2.1 billion in 2015 and
$2.25 billion in 2016. The average analyst estimate had called
for  revenue  of $2 billion and $2.03 billion, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
