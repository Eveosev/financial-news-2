U.S. mortgage rates rose, pushing
borrowing costs for a 30-year loan to a two-month high, after a
jump in  yields (USGG10YR)  for the Treasuries that guide consumer debt.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage climbed to
3.59 percent in the week ended today from 3.51 percent, McLean,
Virginia-based  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  said in a statement. The average 15-year rate increased to 2.77 percent from 2.69 percent.  Yields for 10-year U.S. Treasuries topped 2 percent
yesterday for the first time since March after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told Congress that the central bank
will scale back stimulus efforts if the  employment  outlook shows
sustainable improvement. Home-loan rates increased for a third
week after hovering close to record lows early this month.  “A sustained move upward for a number of weeks can push
buyers off the fence,”  Keith Gumbinger , vice president of
HSH.com, a Riverdale, New Jersey-based mortgage-information
website, said in a telephone interview yesterday. “It can be a
signal that the time is becoming right to move before rates go
up further.”  Sales (ETSLTOTL)  of previously owned U.S. homes climbed to an annual
pace of 4.97 million in April, the most since November 2009,
even as tight  inventory  and strict borrowing rules constrained
deals, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday.  Rising rates are threatening to restrain refinancing. The
 Mortgage Bankers Association ’s index of home-loan applications
dropped the most in almost five months in the week ended May 17,
with the  refinancing  gauge falling 11.7 percent.  The record rate for a 30-year mortgage is 3.31 percent,
reached in November, according to  Freddie Mac . The 15-year
average fell to a record-low 2.56 percent this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
