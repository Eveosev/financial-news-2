Spain ’s borrowing costs rose at an
auction of  government bonds  in Madrid today after European Union
leaders held off calls to boost public spending.  The Madrid-based Treasury sold 4.08 billion euros of debt
($5.25 billion), compared with its maximum target of 4 billion
euros. Its three-year benchmark notes were sold to yield 2.442
percent, compared with from 2.247 percent on May 9, and its
five-year benchmarks 3.001 percent, compared with 2.789 percent
the same day. The yield was 4.54 percent for the 2026 bonds,
after 4.336 percent on May 9.  Spain’s Treasury is seeking to benefit from improving
confidence in the euro area’s fourth-largest economy even as the
European Commission forecasts its public debt load will top the
euro region average next year for the first time in the
currency’s history. German Chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday
said national governments won’t put up more cash to tackle the
euro region recession until they have plans for how to spend it.  “It’s not a matter of money,” Merkel told reporters after
meeting EU leaders in Brussels. “It’s a matter of looking at
how to spend this money most productively.”  The yield on Spain’s  10-year benchmark bond  rose 7 basis
points to 4.252 percent at 11:08 a.m. in Madrid, leaving the
spread with similar German maturities at 2.85 percentage points.
That compares with a euro-era high yield of 7.75 percent in
July, before European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi 
pledged to do whatever is necessary to hold the single currency
together.  Bond Demand  Demand for the 2016 notes was 2.24 times the amount sold
today, compared with 2.34 times at the last sale, while the bid-to-cover ratio was 1.94 for the 2018 securities, compared with
2.24. It was 1.55 for the 2026 bonds, down from 1.62 earlier
this month.  While yields were slightly higher at a three- and nine-months bills sale on May 21, the Treasury last week sold about 7
billion euros of a new 10-year benchmark through banks at a
yield 100 basis points lower than the same benchmark issued via
a syndication in January. It also sold 12-months bills at a
yield of less than 1 percent for the first time in three years.  The Treasury, which plans to return to the markets to sell
bonds on June 6, this week said it had covered about 54 percent
of its planned mid- and long-term gross funding needs for 2013.  To contact the reporters on this story:
