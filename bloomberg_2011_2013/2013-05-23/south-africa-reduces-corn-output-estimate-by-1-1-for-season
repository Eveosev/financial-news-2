South Africa , the continent’s biggest
corn producer, reduced its forecast for production this season
by 1.1 percent as dry weather curbs output, the Crop Estimates
Committee said.  The country may reap 11.4 million metric tons of corn,
Marda Scheepers, a spokeswoman for the committee, said by phone
from  Pretoria . That compares with a median estimate for 11.4
million tons by six analysts in a Bloomberg survey and last
month’s forecast of 11.6 million tons.  “Dry conditions experience earlier in the season in the
North West and Free State provinces impacted negatively on maize
yields,” Scheepers said. Corn is also known as maize.  Some of South Africa’s main growing regions, including the
Free State province, which produces 40 percent of the country’s
corn, hadn’t received sufficient rain for crops to grow during
the planting season, which analysts and traders from BVG (Pty)
Ltd., Senwes Ltd. and Farmwise Grains (Pty) Ltd. said will lead
to lower-than-average yields.  South Africa produced 11.8 million tons last year, more
than the 10.4 million tons harvested in the 2011 season and less
than 2010’s 12.8 million tons, the biggest crop since 1982.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
gained 1.6 percent to 2,192 rand ($228) a ton, the highest since
May 3, by the close in Johannesburg. The yellow variety for
delivery in July rose 1 percent to 2,168 rand a ton.  The committee kept the sunflower-production forecast at
554,500 tons, while the prediction for soybean output was
trimmed 3 percent to 825,600 tons, the committee said. The
sorghum-production estimate remained at 168,114 tons and that
for groundnut output was cut 13 percent to 50,600 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
