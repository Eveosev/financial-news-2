Tsogo Sun Holdings Ltd. (TSH) ,  South
Africa ’s biggest hotel and leisure operator by market value,
said sales will outpace inflation this year as an economic
recovery resuscitates depressed demand for rooms.  Growth during April and May, the first two months of fiscal
2014, has been “slightly above inflation,” Chief Executive
Officer Marcel von Aulock said in a phone interview today. It’s
a continuation of last year’s gains, he said.  Annual inflation in April was 5.9 percent, while  Africa ’s
biggest economy is forecast to grow at its slowest pace since
2009, as labor wage demands slows mining industry output. Tsogo
is highly geared toward the South African consumer in gaming,
and toward corporations through its hotels, with both segments
still experiencing difficult economic conditions, the
Johannesburg-based company said in a statement today.  “The results for the year continue to reflect the growth
potential of the group should these sectors of the South African
economy continue to improve,” it said.  Net income for the 12 months through March declined to 1.63
billion rand ($170 million) from 1.72 billion rand a year
earlier. Revenue rose 10 percent to 9.9 billion rand with 6.8
percent growth in gaming win, 19 percent growth in hotel-rooms
revenue and a 16 percent advance in food and beverage revenue.  Refurbishing Casinos  Tsogo  shares  declined 0.7 percent to 24.80 rand at 11:16
a.m. in Johannesburg, giving the company a market value of 29.3
billion rand. The stock has gained 4.5 percent this year,
compared with a 0.5 percent increase for competitor  Sun
International Ltd. (SUI)   Tsogo, partly controlled by brewer  SABMiller Plc (SAB) , owns and
manages 14,347 rooms in South Africa, other countries in the
continent, the Seychelles and the  Middle East  after the recent
termination of management contracts on hotels in Dubai,
according to von Aulock. It’s investing $179 million in
refurbishing casinos, hotels and expanding in Africa.  “We are focusing on countries where we already operate,”
Von Aulock said. “Africa is not one homogeneous spot.”  Group adjusted headline earnings for the year rose 24
percent to 1.65 billion rand. The company said it will increase
its dividend by 28 percent to 51 cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
