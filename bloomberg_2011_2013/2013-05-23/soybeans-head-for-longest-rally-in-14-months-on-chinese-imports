Soybean futures capped the longest
rally since March 2012 on signs of rising demand from  China , the
world’s largest buyer.  China bought 531,000 metric tons of U.S. soybeans in the
week ended May 16 for delivery after Sept. 1, and an additional
115,000 tons of purchases overnight, government reports showed
today. Sales last week for delivery before Sept. 1 rose nearly
12-fold to 183,480 tons, and inventories before this year’s
harvest will drop to the lowest in nine years, U.S. Department
of Agriculture data show. Exports of  soybean meal  since Oct. 1
are up 33 percent from the same period a year earlier.  Prices have jumped 7.2 percent in May, heading for the
biggest monthly rally since July, when the worst U.S. drought
since the 1930s eroded production and sent soybeans to a record
$17.89 a bushel in September. While the USDA forecasts this
year’s harvest will jump 12 percent to a record, farmers in the
Midwest won’t collect most of those crops until October.  “China is buying, and that has put a strong bid into the
futures market,”  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Co.
in Fowler,  Indiana , said in a telephone interview. “Meal
exports are superb, and that’s a problem with U.S. soybean
supplies falling.”  Soybean futures for July delivery gained 0.4 percent to
close at $14.995 at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
after touching $15.4675, the highest since Nov. 2. Prices rose
for a sixth straight session, the longest rally since March 2,
2012. Soybeans for delivery in November, after the harvest,
climbed 0.3 percent to $12.43, after touching $12.4925, the
highest since April 3.  China Imports  China’s soybean imports will start surging from this month
and jump 17 percent in the season beginning Aug. 1 to 68 million
tons, Hamburg-based researcher Oil World said May 21. U.S.
reserves on Aug. 31 will shrink to 125 million bushels, the
lowest since 2004, the USDA predicted on May 10. As a percentage
of consumption, inventories will be the smallest since at least
1961.  Prices also rose on speculation that new rules from China
to control capital inflows may end commodity-financing deals,
forcing the country’s importers to buy futures to lock in
purchases, Gerlach said. The National Business Daily reported
yesterday some banks have stopped issuing letters of credit for
copper importers after a government crackdown on hot-money
flows.  “Talk that Chinese crushers are buying futures to lock in
shipments because of the crackdown on financing is adding to the
surge in prices today,” Gerlach said. “The only way to ration
supply is to make it uneconomical to use the commodity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
