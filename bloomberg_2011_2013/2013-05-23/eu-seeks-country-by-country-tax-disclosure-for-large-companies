The European Union will seek to make
large companies disclose the taxes they pay and profits they
make on a country-by-country basis as it seeks to crack down on
firms evading their obligations.  Michel Barnier, the EU’s financial services chief, will
seek to put the transparency rules in place “as quickly as
possible,”  Chantal Hughes , his spokeswoman, said in Brussels
today. The measures would also cover subsidies that companies
receive, she said.  “It’s the equivalent of what we already do for  banks ,”
Hughes said. “The idea is therefore to expand that to all large
companies operating in the European Union.”  Barnier’s push comes amid international controversy on
whether companies like  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG)  are taking
excessive advantage of cross-border tax loopholes. EU leaders
vowed this week to investigate “aggressive” tax planning, and
pledged support for tougher corporate transparency rules.  The EU has already taken some steps toward introducing such
country-by-country reporting requirements.  European Parliament lawmakers insisted earlier this year
that draft bank capital rules be expanded to include
transparency on taxes, profits and subsidies. The EU has also
agreed on similar rules for gas, oil and mining companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
