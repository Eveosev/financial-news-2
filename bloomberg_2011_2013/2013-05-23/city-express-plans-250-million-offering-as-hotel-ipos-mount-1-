Hoteles City Express SAB, a Mexican
operator of hotels for business travelers, plans to raise about
$250 million in an initial public offering this year, said
Abelardo Loscos, a company investor relations official.  The hotel operator plans to carry out the offering next
month, Loscos said in a telephone interview today from  Mexico 
City, where City Express is based. About 75 percent of the
offering will consist of new shares, with the remainder coming
from current holders, according to Loscos.  City Express said in a regulatory filing that it has hired
 Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and Corp. Actinver SAB to help
manage the IPO.  The company is seeking to benefit from business travel
demand as  Latin America â€™s second-biggest economy is poised for a
fourth year of growth, according to forecasts compiled by
Bloomberg. City Express plans to use the proceeds to build
hotels and buy stakes in some others, according to the
prospectus.  Grupo Hotelero  Santa Fe , a hotel operator part owned by
private equity firm Nexxus Capital SC, is also among companies
seeking to go public in Mexico this year, according to three
people with knowledge of that transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
