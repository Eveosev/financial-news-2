The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
recovered most of a 1.2 percent morning slide as Hewlett-Packard
Co. led gains in technology shares. Global equities slid, with
Japanese shares plunging the most since the aftermath of the
Fukushima disaster. Copper sank and the yen rallied.  The S&P 500 fell less than 0.3 percent at 4 p.m. in  New
York  after decreasing 0.8 percent yesterday. The MSCI All-Country World Index declined 1.3 percent and  Japan ’s Topix Index
slumped 6.9 percent, the most since March 2011. The yen rose
against its 16 major peers, gaining 1.3 percent to 101.84 per
dollar. Ten-year Treasury yields lost 2.5 basis points to 2.01
percent after topping 2 percent yesterday for the first time
since March. Copper sank more than 2 percent in London, leading
commodities lower.  Hewlett-Packard (HPQ)  jumped 17 percent, the most since 2001, as
cost cuts helped its earnings and forecast top estimates. The
drop in global stocks came as factory output in  China  shrank for
the first time in seven months and overseas investors reacted to
growing concern the U.S. Federal Reserve will scale back its
monetary stimulus program. Fed Bank of St. Louis President  James
Bullard  said today he wants to continue the current pace of bond
purchases as long as falling inflation is a concern.  The swing in stocks “really shows the nervousness in the
marketplace that at any given time a piece of exogenous news can
quickly change the psychology,”  Rick Bensignor , head of trading
strategy at  Wells Fargo Securities LLC  in New York, said in a
phone interview. “But you’re going to have your confirmed bulls
that will use any pullbacks at all to buy. There is enough of
the Street that thinks that the S&P 500 has a few more hundred
points to go.”  Fed Watch  While Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in prepared remarks
to Congress yesterday that a premature withdrawal of stimulus
would put the economic recovery at risk, he later told lawmakers
that the central bank will reduce the flow of purchases as the
outlook for the labor market improves.  The S&P 500 lost about 1.1 percent in two days, its biggest
retreat in more than a month. Utilities in the index tumbled 2.4
percent in the past two sessions as yesterday’s jump in bond
yields reduced demand for their dividends. Utilities pay 3.8
percent of their price in dividends for the second highest yield
among 10 groups, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  NYSE Euronext let stand trades that sent American Electric
Power Co. and NextEra Energy Inc. down at least 54 percent,
while labeling them as “aberrant” and excluding them from
records showing the stocks’ lows of the day.  American Electric Power fell as much as 54 percent to
$22.28 a share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
shares rebounded, trimming the loss to 0.6 percent and closing
at $48.28. NextEra Energy, another electricity supplier, sank as
much as 62 percent to $30.37 before bouncing back to pare the
day’s drop to 1.2 percent and closing at $78.22.  ‘Key Reversal’  Yesterday’s 0.8 percent drop in the  S&P 500  may signal a
“garden variety correction” that will result in a 6 percent to
9 percent retreat in the index, according to Oppenheimer & Co.
technical analyst Carter Worth. The drop met the requirements of
being a “key reversal day,” as well as an “outside day”
because both the session’s  high and low  points exceeded those of
the previous day. Outside days and key reversal days signal
changes in direction more often than not, he wrote.  U.S. stocks pared losses today as government data showed
sales of new homes climbed 2.3 percent to a three-month high of
454,000 homes at an annualized pace from a 444,000 rate in March
that was faster than first estimated. The median estimate of 76
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a gain to 425,000.
The median selling price rose to a record on sales of more
expensive properties. A gauge of 11 homebuilders in S&P indexes
jumped 1 percent.  Jobless Claims  Jobless claims decreased more than forecast, falling by
23,000 to 340,000 in the week ended May 18, Labor Department
figures showed. The median forecast of 50 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a drop to 345,000.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index retreated from the highest level
in almost five years, sliding 2.1 percent for the biggest drop
since July. Trading volume was 24 percent more than the 30-day
average as all 19  industry groups  retreated. HSBC Holdings Plc,
Europe’s biggest bank, sank 3.4 percent. Daimler AG, the world’s
third-largest maker of  luxury vehicles , lost 3.3 percent.  Topix Drops  The  drop  in Japanese shares erased $314 billion in market
value amid record volume, shaking bulls who pushed the  Topix
Index (TPX)  to five-year highs and highlighting their vulnerability to
shocks at home and abroad.  This year’s best performing major equity gauge plunged
after government bond yields rose to the highest levels in a
year and Chinese manufacturing missed estimates. The slide
triggered a halt in Osaka-traded index futures and cut the
measure’s 2013 advance to 38 percent from 48 percent. Gains for
the Topix remain more than twice as big as the S&P 500’s this
year.  JPMorgan Asset Management and Pinebridge Investments LLC
said the selloff was overdue after $1.2 trillion was added to
equities on speculation Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the  Bank
of Japan  would end two decades of deflation. The Topix traded at
as much as 24.8 times earnings this week, higher than 86 percent
of days since 2004, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Mark Matthews , who helps oversee $282 billion as head of Asia
research at Bank Julius Baer & Co., said the rally will resume.  Japan, Emerging  For the first time since April 2005 every company in the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell, dragging the gauge down 7.3
percent. Nikkei 225 futures traded in  Osaka  were up 0.1 percent
in the May 24 session.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index sank the most in 10 months,
losing 2 percent. Russia’s Micex Index slid 3.6 percent, the
biggest drop in a year, while Brazil’s Ibovespa closed little
changed.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies
listed in  Hong Kong  dropped 2.8 percent, the most in six weeks.
The preliminary reading of 49.6 for a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index
released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
compares with a final 50.4 for April. The number was also below
the 50.4 median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 13
analysts. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Oil Falls  West Texas Intermediate oil closed little changed in New
York, slipping 3 cents to $94.25 a barrel, while copper dropped
2.3 percent in London. China is the biggest buyer of industrial
metals and energy. The  S&P GSCI (SPGSCI)  gauge of commodities declined
0.2 percent, the third consecutive drop. Gold futures climbed
1.8 percent to $1,391.80 an ounce.  The yen climbed as much as 2.3 percent against the dollar,
the most since Feb. 25. It reached a 4 1/2 year low of 103.74
per dollar yesterday. Japan’s currency gained 0.7 percent to
131.73 per euro.  The Swiss franc pared gains after climbing as much as 1.3
percent against the euro, the most since Sept. 5, 2011, the day
before the  Swiss National Bank  imposed its currency floor.  Spain’s 10-year  bond yield  climbed 11 basis points to 4.29
percent. Borrowing costs increased as the government sold 4.08
billion euros ($5.26 billion) of debt maturing in 2016, 2018 and
2026.  To contact the reporters on this story:
