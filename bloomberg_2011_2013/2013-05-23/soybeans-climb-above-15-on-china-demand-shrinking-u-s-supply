Wheat futures jumped the most in two
weeks on signs of increasing demand for supplies from the U.S.,
the world’s biggest exporter. Corn prices dropped.  In the week that ended May 16,  exporters  sold 952,561
metric tons of wheat, the most since April 11, U.S. Department
of Agriculture data showed.  Shipments  of 162,900 tons for
delivery in the 12 months that start June 1 were for unknown
destinations, and the  Dominican Republic  bought 68,100 tons.  “We must be fairly well in line with world prices,”  Larry Glenn , an analyst at Frontier Ag in Quinter,  Kansas , said in a
telephone interview. “Wheat is demand-driven.”  Wheat futures for July delivery jumped 2 percent to $7.0225
a bushel at 9:56 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. A close at
that price would mark the biggest gain for a most-active
contract since May 9. Through yesterday, the grain dropped 12
percent this year on speculation that global production will
rise to a record.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$5.30 a bushel.  In the U.S., corn is the biggest crop, followed by
soybeans, hay and wheat, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
