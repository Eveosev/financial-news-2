The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment increased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 1 basis point to 103 basis points
as of 8:44 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. The measure is on course for its
highest close since May 15, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index gained 0.5 of a basis
point to 101 as of 10:46 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp.
prices show. The benchmark has fallen 5 basis points this month,
according to Westpac and CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index climbed 2 basis points to
76.5 basis points as of 9:33 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc.
prices show. The gauge, which has ranged from 74 basis points to
148.1 basis points this year, is set for its first increase this
week, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
