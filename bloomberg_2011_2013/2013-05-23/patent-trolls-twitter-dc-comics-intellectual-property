A  Texas  patent-licensing company that
demands royalties from businesses for simply scanning a document
was sued by Vermont in what the state said is the first such
consumer-protection lawsuit in the U.S.  MPHJ Technology Investments LLC is violating the state’s
consumer protection laws by sending letters and demanding the
businesses pay as much as $1,200 or be sued for patent-infringement, the state contends. It’s the first time a patent
owner has been sued for violating such a law, state Attorney
General William Sorrell said yesterday in a statement.  Congress and technology companies are trying to curtail a
practice in which certain patent owners use the threat of high
legal expenses to extract cash from a large number of businesses
rather than going after software developers or electronic-device
makers. Through the use of mass mailings, the patent owners can
ask for relatively small sums of money and reap a lot of cash.
The strategy is pejoratively known as “patent trolling.”  The letters sent to businesses “are false, deceptive and
likely to mislead the businesses that received them,” the state
said in the complaint filed in  Vermont  state court. MPHJ
“performed little, if any, due diligence to confirm that the
targeted businesses were actually infringing its patents prior
to sending these letters.”  MPHJ contends its patents cover anyone who scans documents
so they can then be sent through e-mail. Among the entities
receiving letters demanding cash were two non-profit agencies
that provide care to disabled people, according to the
complaint.  The state asks that MPHJ be barred from doing any business
in Vermont and be ordered to stop threatening Vermont
businesses. The state seeks civil penalties of as much as
$10,000 for each violation and restitution for any costs to the
businesses.  A lawyer who has represented MPHJ said the company stopped
its activity in Vermont after it was first contacted by the
state attorney general. He defended the company’s practices.  “There are lots of people using the technology,”  Bryan
Farney , a lawyer with Farney Daniels in Georgetown, Texas, said
in a telephone interview. “The company is simply trying to get
people to get licenses to use the technology.”  The case is State of Vermont v. MPHJ Technology Investments
LLC, 282-5-13, State of Vermont, Superior Court,  Washington 
Unit.  Twitter Gets New Patent, Company Will Use It Only for Defense  Twitter Inc., the San Francisco-based company offering
real-time short-messaging service, received a patent and says it
will use the patent only defensively.  Patent 8,448,084, which was issued May 21, covers the use
of a scrollable refresh trigger to update a display of a
scrollable list of contents.  Benjamin Lee, Twitter’s legal director, said in a May 21
blog posting that the patent is the company’s first patent under
its  Innovator’s Patent Agreement . Under the terms of this
agreement, the company agrees with the named inventor that the
patent is to be used only for defensive purposes. If it is used
otherwise, the inventor’s permission will be required.  Twitter will use this agreement, which it announced last
year, on all of its patents, Lee said. The aim of the agreement
is the development of “constructive dialogue making patent
system work better for companies, inventors, and policy makers
alike,” Lee said in the posting.  For more patent news, click here.  Trademark  DC Comics Makes Sure ‘Superman Fitness’ Won’t Fly in  Australia   Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s DC Comics unit has prevailed in a
trademark dispute with a  Melbourne , Australia-based fitness
company, the Sydney Morning Herald  reported .  Cheqout Pty. Ltd. filed an application to register
“Superman workout” as an Australian trademark and was opposed
by DC Comics on the grounds it infringed the marks associated
with the “Superman” comic-book hero and would cause consumer
confusion, according to the newspaper.  Initially the Registrar of Trademarks said that confusion
was unlikely because DC Comics had never been in the business of
offering fitness classes, according to the Herald.  A judge from Australia’s federal court disagreed, and in a
May 22 ruling, barred the registration and found that Cheqout
had filed the application in bad faith, the newspaper reported.  No contact information for the company could be found to
seek comment on the decision.  North American Breweries Unit Sues Kentucky Brewery Over Marks  A small  Kentucky  craft brewery has responded to a trademark
suit from a unit of North American Breweries Inc. by asking its
own customers to petition the larger company to drop the suit.  Rochester, New York-based North American Breweries Inc.’s
Independent Brewers United filed suit in federal court in
Lexington, Kentucky, on May 16, claiming that  West Sixth Brewing
Co. ’s label, featuring the number 7 and a compass star inside a
circle infringed the mark used for its Vermont-based  Magic Hat
Brewing Co. ’s #9 beer. The Magic Hat label is also circular, and
containing #6.  Both breweries’ labels are orange, according to court
papers, and both use many of the same distributors for their
products. North American and Magic Hat claim the public is
confused by the similarity between the two labels.  Magic Hat has used its mark since 1995, and registered it
with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in December 1996.  West Sixth, based in Lexington, is asking each customer to
sign a petition as a “passionate craft-beer drinker” who
opposes the suit and asks Magic Hat to drop it immediately and
“quit being a corporate bully.”  In a  posting  on the brewery website, West Sixth says its
logo was professionally designed by Cricket Press LLC of
Lexington and clearly can’t be confused with Magic Hat’s. The
Kentucky brewery said it tried to no avail to resolve the
dispute with Magic Hat amicably.  It claims that lawyers it has consulted maintain there is
no merit to the suit.  Magic Hat has asked the court to declare that the West
Sixth label infringes, and for an order barring further
infringement. Additionally, it asked for an award of all profits
the Kentucky brewer realized through its use of its allegedly
infringing label, money damages, attorney fees and litigation
costs. The company asked that the damages be tripled.  The case is Magic Hat IP LLC v. West Sixth Brewing Co,
8:13-cv-00136-DCR, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Kentucky (Lexington).  ‘Vampire’ Wine Maker Sues Brewer of ‘Vampire Slayer’ Beer  A  Los Angeles  winery sued a  Massachusetts  brewery for
infringing vampire-related trademarks.  TI Beverage Group Ltd. , which does business as Vampire
Brands, produces a range of products with vampire-themed names,
including Chateau du Vampire, Vampyre, Dracula, and Dracula’s
Blood. The products, which also include beer and vodka, are
marketed through websites with “vampire” as part of the domain
name.  Mercury Brewing and Distribution Co.  of Ipswich,
Massachusetts’ Vampire Slayer beer infringes the  California 
company’s “vampire” trademarks, according to the complaint
filed May 17 in federal court in Los Angeles.  TI claims that the Vampire Slayer brand and design so
closely resembles its Vampire Pale Ale that the public would
“naturally assume it is a spinoff” of the TI vampire brands.
Mercury is using the name deliberately in order to trade off the
goodwill TI has built with its Vampire products, according to
the complaint.  Mercury Brewing didn’t respond immediately to an e-mailed
request for comment on the lawsuit.  TI is seeking a court order barring the Massachusetts
brewery’s use of “vampire” in connection with its products.
Additionally, the company seeks all of Mercury’s sales proceeds
related to the alleged infringement, money damages, litigation
costs and attorney fees.  The case is Vampire Brands LLC v. Mercury Brewing and
Distribution Co., 2:13-cv-03568-SVW-SH, U.S. District Court,
Central District of California (Los Angeles).  For more trademark news, click here.  Copyright  Frontier Custom Builders Must Pay $1.3 Million in Suit  Frontier Custom Builders Inc., a Houston-area homebuilder,
was ordered to pay a $1.3 million judgment in a copyright
infringement case.  Hewlett Custom Home Design of Houston sued Frontier in a
Texas federal court in December 2010, claiming that Frontier was
building homes to designs that belonged to Custom Home.  Frontier was displaying the infringing designs on its
website, and was promoting them through a wide range of
promotional media, according to the lawsuit. Hewlett said it
registered the copyrights on the disputed designs, and asked the
court to bar their unauthorized use.  The design company sought money damages, including
Frontier’s profits from the sale of homes based on the designs.  On May 8, a jury in Houston found that 19 houses Frontier
built infringed Hewlett copyrights. The jury said that no
percentage of the profits Frontier derived from the homes could
be attributed to anything but infringement.  In the final judgment entered May 20, U.S. District Judge
Ewing Werlein Jr. ordered Frontier and Ronald W. Bopp, its
principal, to pay Hewlett $1.3 million in damages. He also
ordered the destruction of any plans that are derived from
Hewlett’s work, and of plans and marketing materials for the 19
homes the jury said had infringed the copyrights.  The case is Hewlett Custom Home design Inc., v. Frontier
Custom Builders Inc., 4:10-cv-04837, U.s. District Court,
Southern District of Texas (Houston).  For more copyright news, click here.  Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage  Sanctions Proposed by U.S. Commission to Deter China Trade Theft  The U.S. should consider new laws to let American companies
better defend themselves against cyber-attacks from Chinese-based hackers, said a commission led by two former advisers to
President  Barack Obama .  The Treasury Department should be empowered to deny access
to the U.S. banking system to companies from  China  and other
countries that benefit from stolen data, and sanctions could be
imposed on those found to benefit from theft, the commission
said in a report released yesterday.  “New laws might be considered for corporations and
individuals to protect themselves in an environment where  law
enforcement  is very limited,” the  Commission on the Theft of
American Intellectual Property  said. The commission is headed by
 Jon Huntsman , Obama’s former ambassador to China who sought the
Republican nomination for president, and Dennis Blair, Obama’s
first director of national intelligence.  The commission didn’t conclude that U.S. companies should
be able to conduct retaliatory cyber-attacks, known as hacking
back, which has been the subject of a policy debate among U.S.
policy makers and computer security experts.  The Pentagon this month for the first time directly accused
the Chinese military of intruding into U.S. computers to steal
sensitive data. The Alexandria, Virginia-based computer security
company Mandiant Corp. released a report in February concluding
that the  People’s Liberation Army  in China may be behind the
hacking of at least 141 companies worldwide since 2006.  Obama will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping June 7 and 8
at the 200-acre Walter and Leonore Annenberg estate in Rancho
Mirage, California, in their first face-to-face talks since
China’s power transition ended in March. Obama’s national
security adviser, Tom Donilon, is scheduled to be in Beijing
next week.  Hong Lei, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, told
reporters May 21 the U.S. has no hard evidence China is behind
cyber-attacks. He said cybersecurity is an issue faced by both
countries.  The group in China identified in Mandiant’s February report
continues its intrusions after being identified publicly,
Richard Bejtlich, the company’s chief security officer, said in
an interview.  Shawn Henry, president of CrowdStrike Services based in
 Palo Alto , California, told a conference in Washington in April
that U.S. laws should be clarified regarding what companies can
do to protect their networks from attacks and raise the cost for
hackers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
