Greenfield Chemical Holdings Ltd. (582) , a
maker of coatings and solvents whose shares surged as much as 28
percent in Hong Kong before trading was halted today, said its
parent company was approached about a possible share sale.  Hong Han Ltd., the parent, doesnâ€™t plan to sell any shares
until a separate acquisition announced in March is completed,
Greenfield said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
today, without identifying the potential purchaser.  Greenfield rose 22 percent to 23 Hong Kong cents when
trading was halted. Trade will resume tomorrow, according to the
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
