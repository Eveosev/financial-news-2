Freddie Mac , the government-controlled mortgage financier, said that it’s begun packaging
modified home loans into bonds that it guarantees, with $1
billion of securitizations already completed.  The “vast majority” of the mortgages reworked to help
homeowners had previously been contained in its bonds and were
bought out after  delinquencies , the McLean, Virginia-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement. Since November
2011, the firm has been repackaging into bonds those loans that
were once delinquent and began performing again without
modifications, it said.  “Securitizing loans that have been modified and are now
performing will allow Freddie Mac to better manage its mortgage-related investments portfolio,” Adama Kah, a vice president of
distressed assets management, said in the statement. “We are
taking another important step that creates liquidity and
taxpayer value.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
