Panasonic Corp. (6752) , a Japanese
electronics maker which began developing solar panels in 1975,
will end solar wafer production at a plant in Oregon.  The Osaka-based company plans to stop making wafers at the
end of June, a spokeswoman Chieko Gyobu said today by phone in
Tokyo. The Nikkei newspaper reported the plan earlier also
saying that the company wants to consolidate production at its
plant in  Malaysia .  The decision will affect about a quarter of the workers at
the Oregon factory that also makes silicon ingots for solar
panels, the spokeswoman said, declining to say how many people
it employs at the plant.  Panasonic closed a solar wafer factory in California last
year, the spokeswoman said. The  Oregon  factory will continue
producing silicon ingots, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
