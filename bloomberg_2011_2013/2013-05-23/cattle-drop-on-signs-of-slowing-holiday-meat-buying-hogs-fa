Cattle futures fell for a second
straight day on speculation that U.S. beef demand is easing. Hog
prices also declined.  Retailers probably have already filled meat orders for
grilling demand for the Memorial Day holiday weekend, which
starts May 25, said Dick Quiter, an account executive at
McFarland Commodities LLC. Meatpackers processed 373,000 cattle
during the first three days of the week, down 0.5 percent from a
year earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  “Demand seems to be a little bit lighter than what they
hoped,” Quiter said in a telephone interview from  Chicago .
“Most of the retail buying for Memorial Day and maybe out even
into Father’s Day, they pretty much have got that locked up.”  Cattle futures for August delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$1.1915 a pound at 10:28 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices were down 9.9 percent this year through
yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement slid 0.1
percent to $1.442 a pound.  Hog futures for July settlement declined 0.4 percent to
93.025 cents a pound. As of yesterday, prices climbed 9 percent
in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
