U.K. stocks  dropped from the highest
level since December 1999, as concern grew the Federal Reserve
will scale back its stimulus measures if the U.S. economy
improves and as data showed Chinese manufacturing contracted.  St James’s Place Plc plunged 9.8 percent after Lloyds
Banking Group Plc said it sold 77 million shares of the British
wealth manager. Halfords Group Plc tumbled 10 percent as the
bicycle retailer cut its final dividend for the fiscal year. BTG
Plc slipped 2.4 percent after saying it will place as many as
32.8 million new shares to help fund its acquisition of Nordion
Inc’s Targeted Therapies unit.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  fell 111.73 points, or 1.6 percent, to
6,728.54 at 9:07 a.m. in  London , its biggest decline since April
5. The benchmark has still  surged 14 percent  this year as
central banks maintained stimulus measures. The broader FTSE
All-Share Index lost 1.8 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index retreated 1 percent.  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100 companies
was almost double the average of the past 30 days, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  China’s manufacturing  is contracting in May for the first
time in seven months, a report showed. The preliminary reading
of a purchasing managers’ index retreated to 49.6 in May from
50.4 the previous month, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
said today. That missed the 50.4 median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey. A reading below 50 signals a contraction.  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, responding to a question from
Representative Kevin Brady as he spoke to a Joint Committee of
Congress in  Washington  yesterday, said the flow of asset
purchases could be reduced “in the next few meetings” if the
Fed is confident gains in the economy can be sustained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
