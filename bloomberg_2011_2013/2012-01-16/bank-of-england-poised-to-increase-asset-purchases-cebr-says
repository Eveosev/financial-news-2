The  Bank of England  will increase
its asset-purchase program next month to support the U.K.
economy, the Centre for Economics and Business Research said.  The economy shrank in the previous quarter and is set to do
so in the current period, the London-based research group said
in a report released today. It cut its forecast for expansion in
2012 to 0.4 percent from 0.6 percent and warned of a 1.1 percent
contraction if the euro-area debt crisis worsens substantially.  The central bank will keep its benchmark  interest rate  at
0.5 percent until 2016 and increase so-called quantitative
easing to 400 billion pounds ($611 billion) this year, according
to the report. The bank last week maintained its bond-purchase
target at 275 billion pounds.  “We take no pleasure in outlining such a bleak forecast,”
said Douglas McWilliams, the CEBR’s chief executive. “But the
world is going through a fundamental change.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
