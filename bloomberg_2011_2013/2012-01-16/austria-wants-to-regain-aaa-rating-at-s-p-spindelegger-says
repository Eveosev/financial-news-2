Austria  wants to regain its AAA
rating at  Standard & Poor’s , Vice Chancellor Michael Spindelegger told reporters in Vienna today.  “We now have to start reforming the system with a cool
head,” Spindelegger said, before a meeting with Chancellor
Werner Faymann, Finance Minister Maria Fekter, Central Bank
Governor Ewald Nowotny and the heads of the financial regulators
on the country’s banks.  “I don’t see a big danger coming from the banking industry
in Austria,” Spindelegger said. The meeting is about the “risk
that Austrian banks have because of their activities in other
countries, which we will now evaluate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
