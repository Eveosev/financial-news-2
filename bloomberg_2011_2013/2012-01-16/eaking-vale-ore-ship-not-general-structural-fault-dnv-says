The leak in  Vale SA (VALE3) ’s Vale Beijing
vessel was not caused by a “global strength issue” or
“general structural problem” for the largest ore carriers,
classification society  Det Norske Veritas (DNVR)  said.  The Vale Beijing, one of the world’s six largest ore
carriers with a capacity of 400,000 metric tons, was damaged
while loading its first cargo in  Brazil  in December. The
incident was “presumably” related to weakness in some areas of
the rear ballast tanks, Oslo-based DNV said in a  statement  on
its website today.  The company, which monitors compliance with design and
structural rules for ships, certified that the Vale Beijing was
safe when it was built and when it entered service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
