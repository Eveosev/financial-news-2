Serbian police stepped up security
after receiving a warning message about a plan to assassinate
President  Boris Tadic  and other political leaders, Belgrade-
based  Blic  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  A text message from a mobile phone sent to police listed
Tadic, Serbian Patriarch Irinej, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic
and Police Chief Milorad Veljovic as targets of a planned
assassination.  The report comes a week after Bosnian Serb police arrested
a man suspected of bringing explosives and weapons into a sports
hall where Tadic and the Serbian leadership attended the 20th
anniversary of the Bosnian Serb Republic, one of the two
entities in ethnically divided Bosnia. Tadic leads the
 Democratic Party , whose former leader Zoran Djindjic, the first
prime minister after the fall of  Slobodan Milosevic , was
assassinated in Belgrade in 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
