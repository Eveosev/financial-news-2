The  European Central Bank  increased
its government bond purchases last week.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said it settled 3.77 billion euros
($4.77 billion) of bond purchases in the week through Jan. 13,
up from 1.1 billion euros the previous week. The ECB will take
seven-day term deposits tomorrow to absorb the 217 billion euros
of liquidity created since its  bond program  started in May 2010,
a practice it employs to ensure the purchases don’t fuel
inflation.  Italian and Spanish borrowing costs fell last week and ECB
President  Mario Draghi  said there are “tentative” signs of
stabilization in the economy even as the sovereign debt crisis
poses downside risks.  Standard & Poor’s  on Jan. 13 downgraded
nine euro-area nations including France and  Austria , saying
efforts to combat the crisis are falling short.  The ECB has refused to ramp up its bond program to help
indebted nations, saying the purchases are aimed solely at
ensuring monetary-policy transmission and it’s up to governments
to solve the crisis. European leaders will this week resume
efforts to agree new fiscal rules to win back investor
confidence in the monetary union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
