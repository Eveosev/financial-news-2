Bank customers will mainly operate
their accounts using digital systems by 2015 as younger
consumers drive demand for mobile and computer platforms,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP said.  Digital banking could prove a significant source of revenue
for banks as most consumers say they’re willing to pay as much
as 10 pounds ($15.29) a month for the service, PwC said. Social
media notifications, electronically-protected loyalty cards and
tailored financial services are popular draws for customers
mostly in their teens and twenties.  “Banks are clearly missing a trick if they don’t start to
invest in their digital offerings and only see digital as a way
to reduce costs,” Stephen Whitehouse, a PwC partner, said in a
statement. “The majority of banks still only provide basic
mobile and Internet banking services.”  Increased regulation and a weak economic environment means
banks are struggling to increase revenue.  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc , Britain’s biggest government-owned bank, is to cut
about 4,800 jobs as it jettisons unprofitable units, it said
last week, citing volatile markets and regulation costs.  In the U.K. almost 65 percent of respondents said they
would pay just over four pounds a month for a bank loyalty card
that converted points into cash. PwC interviewed more than 3,000
banking customers globally for the study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
