German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
backs a proposal by her  Christian Democratic Union ’s
parliamentary group to take measures to lessen the influence of
rating companies on the investment decisions of large
institutional investors, Financial Times Deutschland said today.  Changing the rules may force banks and insurance companies
to rate the creditworthiness of states themselves, reducing
their reliance on credit-rating companies, the newspaper said.  Merkel, speaking after a CDU party conference in the city
of Kiel, said it’s worth looking into possible legal changes on
the role of rating companies, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
