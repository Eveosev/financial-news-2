Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , known
as Sabic, and  China  Petroleum and Chemical Corp. will have
annual polycarbonate capacity of 260 kilo metric tons from a
plant in Tianjin, China, when operations start in 2015.  “The new polycarbonate production will help meet the
projected growth in demand for North East Asia, which includes
China,” Sabic said in an e-mailed statement today. “Satisfying
this demand is essential for producing petrochemical materials
from China’s vast manufacturing industries.”  Sabic, the world’s largest maker of petrochemicals, and
China Petroleum and Chemical, known as Sinopec, yesterday signed
a memorandum of understanding for the construction of the
polycarbonate plant, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.
The agreement was signed during a visit to  Saudi Arabia  by
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.  Wen arrived in  Riyadh  on Jan. 14 for the first visit to
Saudi Arabia by a Chinese premier in 20 years, China’s official
Xinhua News Agency said. Wen will also visit Qatar and the
United Arab Emirates during a Persian Gulf tour ending Jan. 19.  Sabic is “is keen to continue its investments in China’s
marketplace,” Chairman Prince Saud bin Abdullah said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
