Egypt ’s Freedom and Justice Party,
the political affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood, will nominate
its secretary-general, Mohamed Saad El-Katatni, to be the next
parliament speaker.  Freedom and Justice agreed with parties including secular
groups and the Islamist Nour Party to take the speaker’s post,
chairman Mohammed Morsi told reporters today in Cairo. The two
positions of deputy speaker would go to the groups that ranked
second and third in parliamentary elections, he said.  The Brotherhood’s party is leading polls in the legislative
vote, which started in November, while the bloc headed by the
more conservative Nour party ranks second. Final results have
not been announced yet with voting continuing in a number of
constituencies.  Egypt’s first parliament since the ouster of  Hosni Mubarak 
in February “will not exclude anyone” and will cooperate with
the government and the military council in the transitional
period, el-Katatni told reporters today. “The next phase is one
of cooperation between all sides, not of competition.”  Egypt has been governed by the military council since the
ouster of Mubarak. Parliament, scheduled to convene for the
first time on Jan. 23, is supposed to pick a 100-member
committee to draft a new constitution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
