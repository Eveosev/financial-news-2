Azerbaijan is buying up modern
weaponry to be able to regain control of the breakaway Nagorno-
Karabakh region quickly and with few losses should peace talks
with neighboring Armenia fail, President  Ilham Aliyev  said.  Defense spending will rise 1.8 percent this year to $3.47
billion, which Aliyev said tops Armenia’s entire state budget.  “It’s not a frozen conflict, and it’s not going to be
one,” Aliyev said today in remarks broadcast on state
television channel AzTV.  Oil-rich Azerbaijan fought a war with Armenia over Nagorno-
Karabakh, a majority Armenian-populated enclave that broke free
from Baku’s control following the disintegration of the  Soviet
Union  in 1991. The territory remains a potential flash point in
a region where  Russia  fought a five-day war with Georgia in 2008
after separatist tensions flared up over the breakaway regions
of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
