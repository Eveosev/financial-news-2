The  London 2012 Olympics  ticket
resale website, which has been suspended for ten days because of
technical problems, may be up and running again this week,
organizers said.  The site, which is run by Live Nation Entertainment Inc.’s
 Ticketmaster  division, allows ticket holders to resell their
seats at face value. The website was partially suspended Jan. 6
after thousands of people went online to buy and sell tickets on
the opening day.  “We’re due to go back up this week,” a spokeswoman for
the London 2012 organizing committee who declined to be
identified, said in an interview today.  Local organizers said they didn’t know what day the site
may be running normally. “We’re waiting for Ticketmaster to
come back to us with a solution.”  Ticketmaster said it would be releasing a statement on
“the revised resale ticketing strategy” soon.  The resale of London 2012 tickets bought directly from the
organizers runs until Feb. 3 via the buyer’s ticketing account
on the official London 2012 website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
