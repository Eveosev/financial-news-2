Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA (BBVA) , Spain’s second largest bank by assets, are to
launch a databank that will be used to forecast hotel and
tourism demand in the country, the Financial Times reported,
without citing anyone.  The forecasts will be based on Google’s search engine
results, and will help tourism companies predict hotel demand a
month ahead of official data, the newspaper said, adding the
plan would be announced today.  To contact the editor on this story:
