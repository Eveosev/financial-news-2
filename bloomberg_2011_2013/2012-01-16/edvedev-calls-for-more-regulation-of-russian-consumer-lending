Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
called for additional protection for consumers taking out loans,
saying they need more rights in a market dominated by financial
institutions.  Citizens need protection from the “enslaving conditions”
banks and other financial institutions impose on them in loan
agreements, Medvedev told a government meeting in Saransk in
central  Russia  today.  “The price of abuse is too high,” he said. “Banks
themselves aren’t interested in preserving this situation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
