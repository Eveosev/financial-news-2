National Bank of Greece SA , the
country’s largest lender, increased its core Tier 1 capital by
approximately 302 million euros ($383 million) after
repurchasing bonds and hybrid securities.  The Athens-based lender on Jan.3 offered to buy back 1.5
billion euros of 3.875 percent covered bonds due in October 2016
as well as five series of preferred securities in euros, dollars
and pounds. National Bank offered to pay 70 percent of face
value for the covered bonds and 45 percent for the hybrids,
which is below where they were issued and above where they were
trading at the time.  Holders validly tendered securities with an aggregate
nominal value of 753.3 million euros for securities denominated
in the single currency, $47.5 million for dollar-denominated
securities and 39.2 million pounds ($60.1 million) for sterling
denominated securities, National Bank said in an e-mailed
statement today. The settlement date for the purchases by the
lender is Jan. 19.  Buying back debt at a discount to face value generates a
gain in so-called core Tier 1 capital after Greek banks’
holdings of  government bonds  diminished this cushion against
losses, sent stock prices plummeting and prompted depositors to
move savings overseas. The government in  Athens  is negotiating a
debt swap with bondholders to secure more international
financing, which may further hurt lenders’ capital.  To contact the reporters on this story:
