Saudi Arabia  can make up for any
loss of crude production if sanctions are placed on  Iran , CNN
said, citing the country’s oil minister Ali al-Naimi.  “I believe we can easily get up to 11.4, 11.8 almost
immediately, in a few days,” al-Naimi said in an interview with
CNN today. Saudi Arabia has the capacity to produce 12.5 million
barrels a day “and we are idling now between 9.4 and 9.8, so we
have substantial spare capacity,” he said.  “Our wish and hope is we can stabilize this oil price and
keep it at a level around $100,” al-Naimi said, when asked
about the outlook for 2012 amid tensions in the  Persian Gulf .
al-Naimi said he doesn’t expect the Strait of Hormuz to be shut
for an extended length of time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
