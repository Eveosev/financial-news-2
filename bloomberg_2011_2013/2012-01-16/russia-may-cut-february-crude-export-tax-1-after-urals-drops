Russia , the world’s biggest  oil 
producer, may lower its  export duty  on most crude shipments by 1
percent from Feb. 1 after Urals prices fell.  The standard duty may drop to $393.70 a metric ton, or
$53.71 a barrel from $397.50 a ton in January, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on Finance Ministry data. The
discounted rate on some Eastern Siberian and Caspian Sea oil may
fall to $191.20 a ton from $194.10.  Russia bases the export duties on the average Urals crude
price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th of the next.
 Urals (EUCRURNW) , Russia’s benchmark export blend, averaged $108.23 a
barrel during the most recent period,  Alexander Sakovich , a
Finance Ministry adviser, said by phone today. Urals averaged
$109.09 in the previous period, according to the ministry.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  must sign off on the duties
before they take effect. The government lowered the crude  tax
rate  in October, applying a coefficient of 60 percent, down from
65 percent, and unifying the duty on most refined products at 66
percent of that levy.  The duty for middle distillates and heavy products may fall
to $259.80 a ton next month, from $262.30 in January.  A gasoline tax that Putin imposed in May to counter
domestic shortages is expected to drop to $354.30 a ton from
$357.70 this month. That is 90 percent of the crude oil duty.
The government may set the duty on liquefied petroleum gases,
such as butane and propane, at $181.70 a ton, down from $201.  To contact the reporter on this story:
