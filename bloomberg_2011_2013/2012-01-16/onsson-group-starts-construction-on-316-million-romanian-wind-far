Monsson Group, a privately-held
Romanian wind-park developer, started the construction of a 150-
megawatt wind farm in southeastern  Romania , which will require
an investment of about 250 million euros ($316 million),
according to an e-mailed statement.  Vestas Wind Systems AS will supply 50 wind turbines for
Monsson’s farm, located in Constanta County, which will be
finished “in the summer,” Andrei Muntmark, the commercial
manager of Monsson Group, said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
