China Resources Land Ltd. (1109)  signed a
loan for the equivalent of HK$1.3 billion ($167 million) after
initially seeking HK$1 billion, according to a person familiar
with the matter.  The loan was split into a Hong Kong dollar-denominated part
and a yuan-denominated portion. The former pays an interest
margin of 175 basis points more than the Hong Kong interbank
offered rate while the latter pays a fixed rate of 2.75 percent,
the person said, asking not to be identified as details are
private.  DBS Bank Ltd., which coordinated and arranged the loan,
lent HK$500 million. Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. supplied
HK$500 million and Nanyang Commercial Bank Ltd. lent the
equivalent of HK$300 million, split equally between Hong Kong
dollars and yuan, the person said.  Proceeds from the two-year facility will be used for
refinancing and general corporate funding requirements, with
this being the first  Hong Kong dollar  and yuan dual-currency
loan for the borrower, the person said. The loan was signed on
Jan. 12, according to the person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
