The  Bank of Japan  cut its economic
assessment of seven of the country’s nine regions as a global
slowdown and the yen’s gain threaten the nation’s recovery from
the March earthquake.  Conditions in Hokkaido, Hokuriku, Kanto, Tokai, Kinki,
Chugoku and the Kyushu-Okinawa area have deteriorated from
October, the central bank said today in its quarterly Sakura
Report on regional economies. It left its evaluation of Shikoku
and the eartahquake-stricken region of Tohoku unchanged, citing
reconstruction demand in the disaster area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
