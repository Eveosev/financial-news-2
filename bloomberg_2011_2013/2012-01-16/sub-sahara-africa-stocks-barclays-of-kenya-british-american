lender by market value, rose 3.6 percent to 12.80 shillings, the
biggest gain since Dec. 21, on speculation full-year profit will
increase.  “People expect a good performance when they announce their
profit for 2011 because of the cost rationalization they
undertook,” Brenda Kithinji, a research analyst at Nairobi-
based Old Mutual Securities Ltd., said by phone today.
“Barclays is one of the stocks that have fallen below their
valuation in terms of price to earnings and price to book.”  British-American Investments Co. (BRIT)  (BRIT KN), the Kenyan
financial services group that began trading its shares in
September, dropped 2.2 percent to 4.50 shillings, the lowest
since Dec. 15, after saying last week annual profit would fall
at least 25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
