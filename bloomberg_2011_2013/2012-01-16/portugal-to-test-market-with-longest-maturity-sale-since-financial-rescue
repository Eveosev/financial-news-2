Portugal  will test the markets’
appetite for debt tomorrow when the country auctions the longest
maturity bills since it sought rescue funds last year from the
European Union and  International Monetary Fund .  Investors will be asked to bid for 11-month Portuguese
bills as 10-year yields hover at record highs. The rise in rates
followed the Jan. 13 decision by  Standard & Poor’s  to cut
Portugal’s credit rating to non-investment grade, or junk,
meaning the nation’s debt can no longer be held by some index-
tracking funds.  The country sold 12-month debt on April 6, 2011, at an
average yield of 5.90 percent in what was the last sale before
Portugal followed Greece and Ireland in requesting a bailout
from the EU and IMF. Portugal is receiving 78 billion euros
($100 billion) of aid and aims to sell securities maturing in
more than a year at the end of 2013.  “At least in 2012, Portugal will not default,” said
Filipe Silva, who manages 60 million euros of debt securities at
Banco Carregosa SA in Oporto, northern Portugal. “There is some
optimism.”  IGCP, the nation’s debt agency, announced plans Jan. 12 to
offer as much as 2.5 billion euros of three-, six- and 11-month
bills tomorrow. Portugal’s borrowing costs fell at a Jan. 4
auction of 1 billion euros of three-month bills, with the
securities issued at an average yield of 4.346 percent, down
from 4.873 percent at the previous auction on Dec. 7. The sale
attracted bids for 2.4 times the amount offered, compared with a
bid-to-cover ratio of 2 in December.  Initial Rebound  Portuguese bonds rose this year before the Jan. 13
downgrade, returning 5.2 percent with reinvested interest,
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies show. The securities dropped 24
percent last year, the most since at least 1994.  Ten-year Portuguese yields rose as much as 2.03 percentage
points yesterday to an all-time high 14.48 percent, widening the
spread over benchmark German bunds to a record 12.70 percentage
points. The yield slipped to 14.31 percent today and the gap
narrowed to 12.51 percentage points.  Portugal's 3.85 percent bond due April 2021 yesterday 
fell 6.41 0, or 64.10 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 
47.805, and was at 48 today.                                                      French borrowing costs fell yesterday at the country’s
first bill sale since S&P stripped the nation of its top  credit
rating . The rate on 10-year French debt declined 4 basis points
to 3.03 percent as investors shrugged off the downgrade.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. research shows that 10-year yields for the
nine sovereigns that lost their AAA status between 1998 and 2011
rose by an average 2 basis points in the next week.  Index Trackers  Investors ignored S&P in August when it cut the U.S. to AA+,
with the yield on the country’s benchmark government bond
falling to a record low of 1.6714 percent seven weeks later.  For Portugal, “I don’t see any problem with completing the
sale of this larger maturity,” said Artis Frankovics, an
interest rate analyst at Nomura International Plc in  London .
“The problem with Portugal is that following Friday’s downgrade,
its rating is now below investment grade from all major  credit
rating agencies , and thus its bonds don’t meet the eligibility
criteria for some of the index-tracking funds” that typically
hold the securities, he said.  Portugal’s central government needs to borrow about 17.4
billion euros in 2012, the country’s debt agency said on Dec. 29.
It has no bond redemptions until June 2012, when it faces a 10
billion-euro maturity.  Portuguese residents hold almost 40 percent of the
country’s government debt, the IMF said in a Dec. 20 report,
adding that foreign investors are willing to purchase the bonds
“at reasonably higher rates.”  Negative Outlook  S&P lowered Portugal’s credit rating last week two levels
to BB with a negative outlook, indicating a one-in-three chance
of another downgrade within 12 months. The country’s rating was
cut to below investment grade in July by Moody’s Investors
Service as the long-term government bond ratings were lowered to
Ba2 from Baa1, while Fitch on Nov. 24 reduced the rating one
level to BB+ from BBB-.  The downgrade reflects “deepening political, financial,
and monetary problems within the  euro zone , with which Portugal
is closely integrated,” S&P said in its Jan. 13 statement. The
decision also stems from “sustained external financing
pressures on Portugal’s private sector, and what these may imply
for growth performance and, in turn, public finances,” the
company said.  IMF’s View  The IMF said Dec. 20 that the European debt crisis is a
“serious” risk to Portugal as the nation seeks to meet the
targets of its financial aid program and return to bond markets
in two years. “Portugal’s program has remained broadly on track,
but rising stress in  Europe  is a serious risk,” the Washington-
based lender said.  Greece and creditors are discussing a reduction in the face
value of its debt as the country tries to avoid default. S&P
estimated holders of Portuguese government debt could achieve an
average recovery of 30 percent to 50 percent in the event of a
default or debt restructuring.  Portugal aims to trim its  budget deficit  to 4.5 percent of
gross domestic product in 2012 from 9.8 percent in 2010, and to
the EU ceiling of 3 percent in 2013.  The country’s  economic growth  has averaged less than 1
percent a year for the past decade, placing it among Europe’s
weakest performers. The economy will shrink 3 percent in 2012
and may then expand 1.1 percent in 2013, the European Commission
forecast on Nov. 10. The euro area is forecast to expand 0.5
percent in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
