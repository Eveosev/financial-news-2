The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars rose to an 11-week high versus their U.S. counterpart
after  China’s economy  grew more than forecast, adding to signs
the country will grow enough to support demand for the South
Pacific nations’ exports.  The Aussie and New Zealand’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi,
advanced versus most major peers as global stocks rose. They
remained higher as a report showed  manufacturing  in the New York
region climbed this month, adding to signs of a U.S. recovery.  Today’s Chinese data “certainly allays fears that  China  is
going to see a hard landing, and that is generally seen as a
positive for the world,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency
strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in  Singapore . “It’s hard to
get too downbeat in the near term” about the Australian and New
Zealand dollars, he said.  Australia ’s currency appreciated 0.8 percent to $1.0392 at
12:01 p.m. New York time. It touched $1.0450 earlier, the
strongest level since Nov. 1. The Aussie rallied 0.8 percent to
79.81 yen. It rose 0.2 percent to 81.58 euro cents, after
earlier reaching a record high 81.77 euro cents.  New Zealand’s dollar advanced 0.9 percent to 80.05 U.S.
cents and touched 80.31 cents, also the highest since Nov. 1.
The kiwi strengthened 0.9 percent to 61.47 yen.  China is Australia’s biggest trading partner and New
Zealand’s second-largest export destination. China’s gross
domestic product expanded 8.9 percent in the fourth quarter from
a year earlier, the statistics bureau said in Beijing today.
That compared with an 8.7 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey of economists.  The MSCI World Index of equities gained 1 percent and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.98 percent.  The Federal Reserve Bank of  New York ’s  general economic 
index increased to 13.5, the highest level since April, from a
revised 8.2 in December. Economists in a Bloomberg survey
projected a rise to 11. Readings higher than zero signal
expansion among companies in the Empire State Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
