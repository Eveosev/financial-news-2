Telekom Austria AG (TKA) , the partly
state-owned telephone operator, said Ronny Pecik’s RPR
Privatstiftung holds 20.118 percent of the company through
shares and options.  RPR’s Marathon Zwei Beteiligungs GmbH holds more than 15
percent of Telekom Austria’s shares and 5.1 percent in  call
options , which are exercisable until June 18, the company said
in a statement late yesterday.  The Alpine republic’s former phone monopoly said in
November that Marathon Zwei held 15.8 percent via shares and
options, after acquiring options to buy 5.4 percent of the
company’s rights in October. Pecik, who said in October that
he’s teamed up with Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris to buy a
stake in Telekom Austria, told Format magazine on Dec. 16 that
he was aiming for 25 percent of  Telekom Austria .  To contact the reporter on this story:
