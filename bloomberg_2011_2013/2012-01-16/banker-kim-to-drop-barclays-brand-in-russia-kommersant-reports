Igor Kim, who last year acquired
 Barclays Plc’s (BARC)  Russian unit, intends to restore the lender’s
former name of Expobank, Kommersant  reported , citing
unidentified people with knowledge of the plans.  The lender will switch its emphasis to the mass retail
segment away from a focus on wealthy clients, Kommersant said.  Barclays agreed to sell Expobank to a group of investors
including Kim in October for an undisclosed amount three years
after buying Expobank for $745 million, the newspaper said.  Barclays declined to comment and Kim was available for
comment, according to Kommersant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
