Portugal is “dissatisfied” with
the decision by  Standard & Poor’s  to cut the country’s  credit
rating , Tanjug news agency reported, citing Portuguese Foreign
Affairs Minister Paulo Portas as saying.  Portas, in Belgrade for an ambassadorial conference, said
yesterday that S&P’s action was based on “regional, rather than
national evaluations” and if the same national evaluation
methodology was applied as the one in March last year,
“Portugal would have shown a satisfactory progress,” Tanjug
said.  Portugal was one of nine countries downgraded by S&P on
Jan. 13, with its credit rating lowered by two levels to BB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
