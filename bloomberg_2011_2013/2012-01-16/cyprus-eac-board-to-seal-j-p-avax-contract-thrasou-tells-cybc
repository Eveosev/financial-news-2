The board of the Electricity of
Cyprus will have to formally approve a renegotiated deal with
 J&P-Avax SA (AVAX)  for the completion of a unit at the Vasilikos plant,
chairman Haris Thrasou told CyBC.  The new contract will allow the Athens-based construction
company to complete construction work before summer on the
plantâ€™s fifth 220-megawatt unit, which had been halted by an
explosion on July 11, Thrasou told the Nicosia-based state radio
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
