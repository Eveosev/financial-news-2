Rahul Khullar, the top bureaucrat in
 India ’s Commerce Ministry, comments on the government’s
inability to offer exporters a stimulus package. India’s export
growth accelerated in December, climbing 6.7 percent to $25
billion, Khullar said today. Merchandise shipments rose 82
percent in July 2011 from a year earlier, the fastest pace since
April 1995.  “I think there is no financial or fiscal leeway for
stimulus packages at this point of time. There is a very large
fiscal deficit. That’s causing a crowding-out problem. It’s also
causing pressure on  interest rates , on monetary policy, choking
investment, choking growth. If you ask me will somebody throw
dollops of money at the export sector, my answer is no.”  On Kingfisher Airlines Ltd.’s request to import jet fuel:  “No decision as yet. They’ve applied to the Director
General of  Foreign Trade , who has examined the issue. I have
also had a look at it. There’s no decision at this point of
time.”  On trade with  Iran  after U.S. sanctions:  “That’s being resolved. A team from the department of
economic affairs is going out this week, today or tomorrow,
they’re leaving for Iran. They will work out, in terms of the
new sanctions under section 1,245 of the U.S. act, how you work
around it, both in terms of importing oil and promoting Indian
exports.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
