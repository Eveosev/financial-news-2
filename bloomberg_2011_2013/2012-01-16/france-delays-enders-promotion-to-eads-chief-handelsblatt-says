France is delaying the nomination of
 Tom Enders  as chief executive officer of  European Aeronautic,
Defence and Space Co. ,  Handelsblatt  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  France, as a shareholder in EADS, has requested more
information before deciding to extend contracts for more than 10
managers, the German newspaper reported, citing a top executive
that it didn’t identify.  Enders, currently head of the company’s  Airbus (EAD)  unit, has
plans to move the finance and personnel departments to the
planemaker’s headquarters in Toulouse, France from EADS’s head
offices in Paris and Munich, the German newspaper said. In
return, the government in Paris wants to control the finance
department and have a French national head the helicopter unit
Eurocopter, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
