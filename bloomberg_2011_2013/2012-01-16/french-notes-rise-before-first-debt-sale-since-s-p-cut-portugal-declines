French bonds advanced as borrowing
costs fell at the nation’s first debt sale since  Standard &
Poor’s  stripped it of its top  credit rating  and cut the grades
of eight other euro-area countries.  Portuguese bond yields reached a record after they were
downgraded by S&P to the second-highest non-investment grade,
with a negative outlook, and Citigroup Inc. said the nation’s
debt will be removed from its European Government Bond Index.
 France  sold 1.895 billion euros ($2.41 billion) of one-year
bills at a yield of 0.406 percent, down from 0.454 percent on
Jan. 9. Greek bonds  climbed  for a fifth day before a resumption
of negotiations this week on a plan to reduce the nation’s debt.  “The bill auctions have been carried out without a
problem, which is helpful for  market sentiment  toward the euro
area,” said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist at Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “The reaction
to the S&P downgrade has been somewhat muted. The move wasn’t a
surprise and was well-flagged for a number of the issuers.”  French 10-year bond  yields  slid four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3.04 percent at 4:12 p.m. London time. The
3.25 percent security due October 2021 rose 0.325, or 3.25 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.775. France’s two-year note
yield was five basis points lower at 0.66 percent.  Ratings Cuts  France joined  Austria  in losing its top credit rating after
government-bond markets closed on Jan. 13, leaving  Germany 
holding the euro region’s only stable AAA grade with S&P. The
nations were cut one level to AA+ from AAA and face the risk of
further reductions, the rating company said. While Finland, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg kept their AAA ratings, they were put
on negative outlook. Spain and  Italy  were also among the nations
downgraded and  Portugal  was cut two steps to BB.  Volatility on Portuguese sovereign debt was the highest in
euro-area markets today, according to measures of 10-year bonds,
two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps. The
move in the 10-year yield was 17.3 times the 90-day average.  The bond’s decline pushed the rate as much as 203 basis
points higher to 14.48 percent, the most since Bloomberg began
collecting the data in 1997. The price fell to 48.69 percent of
face value. Two-year note yields climbed 311 basis points to
15.78 percent.  The drop is “a function of Portugal’s absolute rating now
which sees it dropping out of various indices,” said Eric Wand,
a fixed income strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in
 London . “By keeping a whole swathe of nations on negative
outlook, this keeps the pressure on the ECB to keep buying.”  ECB Bond Purchases  German five-year note  yields  were little changed at 0.75
percent after matching a record low 0.733 percent. Ten-year
bunds,  Europe ’s benchmark security, yielded 1.77 percent.  Italian and Spanish bonds rose after the ECB was said by
four people with knowledge of the transactions to have bought
the securities. The people declined to be identified because the
deals are confidential.  The ECB increased its government bond purchases last week,
settling 3.77 billion euros of acquisitions in the week through
Jan. 13, up from 1.1 billion euros the previous week.  Italian 10-year yields were three basis points lower at
6.62 percent after climbing as much as 22 basis points.  Spain ’s
benchmark 10-year yield fell four basis points to 5.19 percent.  Greek bonds maturing in October 2022 advanced as the
nation’s government and its creditors said they would return to
the negotiating table this week in an attempt to revive stalled
talks on a debt swap.  Greek Negotiations  European officials and bondholders agreed in October to
implement a 50 percent cut in the face value of Greek debt by
voluntarily exchanging outstanding bonds for new securities,
with a goal of reducing the country’s borrowings to 120 percent
of gross domestic product by 2020.  The two sides, which broke off negotiations on Jan. 13,
have struggled to reach an accord on the coupon and maturity of
the new bonds to determine losses for investors, raising the
danger of a sovereign default. The yield on the 5.9 percent
security dropped 26 basis points to 34.11 percent. The price
rose to 20.665 percent of face value.  Bill Gross , who runs the world’s biggest bond fund at
Pacific Investment Management Co., said  Greece  is heading for
default.  Dutch (GNTH10YR)  10-year yields dropped to a record low 2.019 percent
after the Netherlands sold 2.19 billion euros of 100-day bills
at a yield of 0.011 percent. The nation also sold 1.02 billion
euros of bills due in June at a yield of 0.013 percent.  Solid Result  The auction saw “a very solid result suggesting that the
market was encouraged by S&P’s decision to keep its Dutch rating
as AAA despite assigning it a negative outlook,” Sercan Eraslan, a fixed-income strategist at WestLB AG in Dusseldorf,
wrote in an e-mailed note.  Finland ’s 10-year yields fell to a euro-era record of 2.10
percent. Belgian bonds also rose as S&P left the nation’s AA
rating unchanged and took it off negative watch. The country
plans to sell 10-year bonds through banks in “the near
future,” its  finance ministry  said today. The 10-year yield
slipped seven basis points to 4.09 percent.  Bunds have handed investors a return of 0.4 percent this
year, after gaining 9.7 percent in 2011, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. French and Greek bonds have both advanced
0.1 percent and Portuguese debt has gained 5.2 percent, the
indexes show.  The leaders of Italy, France and Germany will probably
delay planned talks on the euro-area debt crisis until after the
next European Union summit on Jan. 30, an Italian government
official said.  Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti , German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  and French President Nicolas Sarkozy were due to
meet in  Rome  on Jan. 20. The meeting was canceled at Sarkozy’s
request because of a scheduling conflict, the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity because the governments haven’t
announced the change yet, said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
