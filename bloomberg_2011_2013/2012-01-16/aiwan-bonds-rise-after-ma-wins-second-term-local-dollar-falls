Taiwan’s government bonds rose on
speculation global funds were adding to holdings after President
Ma Ying-jeou was elected for a second term. The local dollar
fell on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will curb global growth.  Ma, whose first term was characterized by the pursuit of
closer ties with China through trade agreements, defeated the
Democratic Progressive Party’s Tsai Ing-wen by a 6 percentage
point margin. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index dropped
for a second straight day after  Standard & Poor’s  stripped
France of its top rating and downgraded eight other European
nations.  “We’re seeing some foreign funds buying bonds after Ma’s
win,” said  James Wang , a fixed-income trader at Yuanta
Securities Co. in Taipei. “Investors are waiting for some
buying opportunities.”  The yield on the 1 percent notes due January 2017 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.96 percent, prices
from Gretai Securities Market show. The rate dropped three basis
points last week.  The  Taiwan dollar  weakened 0.2 percent to NT$30.070 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It earlier
advanced as much as 0.1 percent.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.4 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
