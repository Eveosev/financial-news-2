The Court of Arbitration for Sport
delayed a ruling in the case of three-time Tour de France winner
 Alberto Contador , citing “rumors” spread by media about the
fairness of the hearing.  Contador failed a drugs test at the 2010 Tour and the  World
Anti-Doping Agency  is appealing his acquittal. The court said it
asked the cyclist and WADA whether they wanted to protest about
the three-man tribunal, and both declined. A ruling will be made
in about two weeks, the court added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
