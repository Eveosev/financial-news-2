LCH Clearnet Group Ltd.,  Europe ’s
biggest clearinghouse, comments on its AAA benchmark index after
the downgrade by  Standard & Poor’s  of the ratings on some euro-
area nations on Jan. 13.  LCH made the comments in an e-mailed statement today.  “We use an internal benchmark of AAA which is broadly
representative of European government bonds.  ‘‘Any change in the relationship between government
security and the benchmark which are driven by changes in the
benchmark, do not affect the ‘riskiness’ of the underlying
security. In such circumstances an increase in the spreads would
not be indicative of an increase in risk and is likely therefore
to be disregarded.  ‘‘Our risk managers are pragmatic and use their discretion,
based on a number of factors, to determine when a raise in
margin is required.  ‘‘The spread we monitor markets against is a representative
AAA benchmark for European  government bonds  with 10 year
maturity.  ‘‘The benchmark is calculated internally and broadly
represents the yield levels of AAA countries.  ‘‘We would always seek to use a benchmark that is broadly
representative of AAA yield levels.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
