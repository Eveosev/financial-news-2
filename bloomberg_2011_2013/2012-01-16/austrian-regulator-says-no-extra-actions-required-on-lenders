Austrian’s financial regulator said
there aren’t any additional actions required regarding the
country’s lenders, Co-Chief Helmut Ettl said in Vienna today.  “There is no action needed,” Ettl told reporters today
following a meeting between  Austria ’s Chancellor Werner Faymann,
Vice Chancellor Michael Spindelegger, Finance Minister Maria Fekter and Central Bank Governor Ewald Nowotny on the Alpine
republic’s banks.  The meeting took place three day’s after Standard & Poor’s
cut Austria’s AAA rating to AA+ with a negative outlook.  “We will make every effort to win back the AAA rating,”
Ettl said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
