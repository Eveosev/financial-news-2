Undefeated  Syracuse University 
retained the top spot in the Associated Press College Basketball
poll this week, as the  University of  North Carolina  dropped five
spots to No. 8 following its worst loss in more than eight
seasons.  The Orange (19-0) received 60 of the 65 first-place votes.
The  University of Kentucky  (17-1), ranked No. 2, received four
first-place votes and No. 3 Baylor (17-0) received one. Duke
(15-2) and  Missouri  (16-1) complete the top five.  The Tar Heels, who topped the rankings in the preseason,
fell 90-57 to unranked Atlantic Coast Conference-rival Florida
State on Jan. 14 in the team’s most lopsided loss since coach
Roy Williams took over the program in 2003.  Murray State University  (18-0), the only other undefeated
team in the country, jumped three spots to No. 12. The Racers
beat  Memphis , then No. 21, on Dec. 11 in their only game against
a ranked opponent this year.  Syracuse, the third team to hold the No. 1 ranking this
season, has been atop the polls since Dec. 12. UNC held the spot
for the first three weeks of the season, followed by  Kentucky .  The Orange will not play a team currently in the Top 25
until Feb. 8, when it begins a three-game stretch against No. 10
Georgetown (14-3), No. 13 University of Connecticut (14-3) and
No. 23 Louisville (14-4), all Big East rivals.  Baylor plays No. 7  Kansas  (14-3) and Missouri this week in
the only two match-ups between Top 10 teams.  No. 22 Illinois (15-3), which beat No. 6 Ohio State 79-74
on Jan. 10, and No. 24  St. Mary’s College  (17-2), which hasn’t
lost since a Dec. 22 defeat to Baylor, entered the Top 25 after
being unranked in the previous poll. Gonzaga and Seton Hall were
dropped after losses last week.  The Big Ten and  Big East  lead all conferences with five
teams each.  -- Editor: Michael Sillup  To contact the reporters on this story:
