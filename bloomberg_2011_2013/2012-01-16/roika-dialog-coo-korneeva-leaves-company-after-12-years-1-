Troika Dialog Chief Operating
Officer Maria Korneeva has left the company after 12 years as
 Russia ’s oldest brokerage completes its merger with  OAO
Sberbank (SBER) , the country’s biggest lender.  Korneeva would like to take “a short break” and consider
new career opportunities, she said today in e-mailed comments in
response to questions posed by Bloomberg. She previously worked
at Renaissance Capital and joined Troika Dialog in 2000 as risk
management director, before being promoted to deputy chief
executive officer and COO in 2009.  Troika has hired three senior bankers in the past month as
part of its plans to increase its investment banking staff of
100 by 25 percent to 40 percent in the next year to 14 months.  Sberbank Chief Executive Officer  German Gref , a former
economy minister, told employees on Dec. 2 the acquisition of
Troika would close by mid-February. Gref wants to turn the
savings bank into a full-service financial firm that can compete
at home and abroad on everything from bond underwriting to  stock
trading .  To contact the reporter on this story:
