Nigeria ’s government approved a
reduction in the gasoline price as a nationwide strike over the
abolition of fuel subsidies in Africa’s largest crude producer
entered a second week.  The West African nation will cut the pump price of gasoline
to 97 naira per liter, President  Goodluck Jonathan  said in an e-
mailed copy of a speech today. “The Petroleum Products Pricing
Regulatory Agency has been directed to ensure compliance with
this new pump price,” he said.  The government’s offer to reduce fuel prices falls short of
union demands for a full reversal, the Nigeria Labour Congress
and the Trade Union Congress, the country’s biggest labor
federations, said in a statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
