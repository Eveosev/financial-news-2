Oil shipments from West Africa are
rising as buyers seek additional cargoes after  Iran  threatened
to block the  Strait of Hormuz , Arctic Securities ASA said.  An increase in cargoes from West Africa has reduced the
supply of available ships, boosting charter rates for very large
crude carriers, Oslo-based analyst Erik Nikolai Stavseth wrote
in an e-mailed report today. Each VLCC can carry 2 million
barrels of oil. The strait is a chokepoint for shipments of
crude from the  Persian Gulf .  “Some buyers are positioning for other cargoes from West
Africa to compensate for any possible blockade of the Persian
Gulf by Iran,” Stavseth said by phone from Oslo. “An increase
in suezmax rates in West Africa results in less ships in the
Persian Gulf, and this is net positive for VLCC rates in the
gulf and West Africa.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
