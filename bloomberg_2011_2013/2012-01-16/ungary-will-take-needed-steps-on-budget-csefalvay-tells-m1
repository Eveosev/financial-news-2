The Hungarian government will take
all necessary steps to address any potential  budget  slippage and
meet its spending goal because a recession is possible, a
government official said today.  “Whenever it becomes necessary, the government will
implement the necessary adjustments to keep the  budget deficit 
below 3 percent of gross domestic product,” Economy Ministry
State Secretary Zoltan Csefalvay told public television M1.  Hungary ’s  economy  faces a “serious possibility” of a
recession this year, Csefalvay said, adding that the European
Union is unlikely to freeze development funds to Hungary as part
of an ongoing excessive deficit procedure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
