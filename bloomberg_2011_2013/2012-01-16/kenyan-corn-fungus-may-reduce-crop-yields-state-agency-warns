Corn production in  Kenya  may decline
as a result of a fungal disease reported to have destroyed more
than 1,000 acres (405 hectares) of the crop in the southwest of
the country, the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service said.  The agency is currently conducting laboratory tests on
samples of the fungi before identifying it, Esther Kimani, general
manager of phytosanitary services at Kephis, said in an e-mailed
response to questions today. The symptoms of the disease, which
has been reported in Bomet County, 175 kilometers (109 miles)
northwest of Nairobi, the capital, include leaf discoloration
and wilting, she said.  “It has a significant effect on yield of the crop,
hence the cause of concern,” Kimani said.  Bomet County is in Kenya’s Rift Valley region, which
accounts for 80 percent of the East African nation’s corn
output. The country was expected to produce 26 million bags of
the staple grain last year, Business Daily, a Nairobi-based
newspaper, reported in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
