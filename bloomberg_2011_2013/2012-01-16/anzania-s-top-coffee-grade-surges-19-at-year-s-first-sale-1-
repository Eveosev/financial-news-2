Tanzania’s benchmark coffee grade
rose 19 percent at the first auction of the year as supplies
fell and buyers replenished stocks amid improved global prices,
the Tanzania Coffee Board said.  The average price for the arabica AA grade climbed to
$273.86 a 50-kilogram (110 pounds) bag from $229.62 at the last
sale of 2011, the board said in an e-mailed report today. The
grade sold for as much as $331 a bag, compared with $316.80 at
the previous sale, and supplies of it plunged 65 percent to
2,092 bags, the report showed.  Farmers in the country reap their crops from April through
August. The arabica variety accounts for 75 percent of
production and robusta makes up the rest.  Following are details of the Jan. 13 auction in U.S.
