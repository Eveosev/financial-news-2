Russia ’s OAO Gazprom offered to buy
Ukraine’s natural-gas pipeline system for $4 billion,
 Kommersant-Ukraine  newspaper reported, citing an unidentified
aide to Ukrainian president  Viktor Yanukovych .  Ukraine has refused to take part in talks on selling its
pipelines and wants to establish an international group to
manage the network, in which it would have a 34 percent share
and Russia and European partners would each hold 33 percent, the
Kiev-based newspaper cited the official as saying.  Ukraine seeks to cut imports of Russian gas to 8 billion
cubic meters a year in the future, Kommersant reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
