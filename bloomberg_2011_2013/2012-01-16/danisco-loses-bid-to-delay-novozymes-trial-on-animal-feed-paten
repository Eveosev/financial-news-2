Danisco A/S (DCO)  lost a bid to delay a
U.K. trial in its patent battle with  Novozymes (NZYMB)  A/S over a type
of enzyme which aids digestion of animal feed.  Danisco, a unit of DuPont Co. that makes food additives,
sought to pause the case until the European Patent Office ruled
on the dispute.  Novozymes (NZYMB) , the world’s largest maker of industrial enzymes,
is fighting to defend its animal feed patent in Denmark,
 Germany , Finland and the Netherlands. Danisco has sold a product
that Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based Novozymes says has infringed the
patent since 2007, according to a previous ruling in the case.  The U.K. Court of Appeal today rejected Danisco’s second
application to push back the trial, and for permission to use
documents from the U.K. case in the European proceedings.  The  European Patent Office , which isn’t part of the
European Union but offers the closest protection available to an
EU-wide patent, revoked Novozymes’ patent in July. The decision
has been appealed by Novozymes and will be heard by the EPO
later this year.  Danisco’s lawyer Christopher Stothers and Novozymes’ lawyer
Morag Macdonald declined to comment after today’s hearing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
