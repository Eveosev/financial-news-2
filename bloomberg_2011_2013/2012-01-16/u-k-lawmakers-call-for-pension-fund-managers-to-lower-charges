U.K. opposition lawmakers are
calling for pension-fund managers to cut their fees in order to
boost the amount of money savers set aside for their retirement.  In a motion calling for a debate in the House of Commons,
33 Labour Party lawmakers urged the government today to take
steps to reduce fees and commissions from traders and fund
managers of as much as 67 billion pounds ($103 billion) a year.  “Hidden costs in pension and savings funds are the City’s
dirty secret,” said lawmaker Gareth Thomas. “They risk making
Britain less competitive than our major competitors. Worse, they
risk making the next generation of pensioners and the
communities they live in poorer and less resilient.”  Citing research presented to the Treasury by Christopher
Sier, a former consultant to investment managers, and David Norman, formerly chief executive officer of Credit Suisse
Asset Management, the lawmakers said fees are higher in Britain
than in France, Germany and the U.S.  Their proposal is contained in an Early Day Motion, a
formal submission designed to draw attention to an issue. Few of
them are actually debated in Parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
