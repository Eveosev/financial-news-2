The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment rose,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 7 basis points to 208 as of 8:17
a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.
The gauge is headed for its highest close since Jan. 9,
according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index increased 4 basis points to
189 as of 9:20 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. It
is set for its highest close since Jan. 12, according to CMA,
which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index rose 5 basis points to
180 as of 11:17 a.m. in Sydney, Royal Bank of Scotland prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
