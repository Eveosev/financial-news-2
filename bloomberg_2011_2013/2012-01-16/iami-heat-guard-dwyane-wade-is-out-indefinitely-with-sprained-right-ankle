The  Miami Heat  have lost three
straight games and now will be without All-Star guard  Dwyane Wade , who’s out indefinitely with a sprained right ankle.  Wade, who also has missed time this season with a bruised
right foot and strained right calf, injured his ankle during the
fourth quarter of Miami’s 117-104 loss in Denver on Jan. 13.  “He probably needed to sit down and rest in the first
place,” Miami forward Chris Bosh told reporters after practice
yesterday. “Sometimes the injury can do that. We need him to be
healthy when it’s time to make a run in the playoffs. He needs
to just chill out right now, get better and we’ll hold it down
until he gets back.”  Wade, 29, is averaging 19.6 points, 5.4 assists and 4.3
rebounds this season for the Heat, who have an 8-4 record.
Miami’s next three games, all at home, are against the  San
Antonio Spurs ,  Los Angeles Lakers  and Philadelphia 76ers, who
have a combined 26-12 record.  “He’s been in this league for a while. He knows when to
come back,” Bosh said of Wade. “You don’t want to push it,
because health is the most important thing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
