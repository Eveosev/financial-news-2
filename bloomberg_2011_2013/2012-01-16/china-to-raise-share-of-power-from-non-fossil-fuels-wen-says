China , the world’s biggest consumer
of coal, will increase the proportion of power it generates from
non-fossil fuels to 11.4 percent by 2015, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said.  China produced 8.4 percent of its electricity from non-
fossil fuels in 2010, he said today at an energy conference in
 Abu Dhabi , adding it will “vigorously” develop renewable
energy. China will focus on domestic sources of renewables,
natural gas and nuclear power, he said.  China, the world’s second-largest economy, will work more
closely with other countries to “build a new world of green and
sustainable development,” Wen said. Nuclear is a “safe,
reliable and mature source of energy,” he said.  The nation is switching to non-fossil energy sources for
power as the government seeks to cut carbon dioxide emissions by
as much as 17 percent per unit of gross domestic product in its
five-year plan through 2015, Wen said Feb. 27.  Wen is on a tour in the Persian Gulf amid concern that
tighter economic sanctions may disrupt exports from  Iran , OPEC’s
second-largest crude producer. Wen’s tour includes  Saudi Arabia ,
Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, which are all members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  To contact the reporters on this story:
