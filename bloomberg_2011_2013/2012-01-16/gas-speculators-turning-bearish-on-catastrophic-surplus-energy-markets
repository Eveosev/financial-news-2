Hedge funds  turned bearish on U.S.
natural gas for the first time in eight weeks as a surplus and
warmer-than-normal weather pushed the price of the heating fuel
to the lowest level in more than two years.  The funds and other large speculators switched from bets
that futures will rise to a bearish, or “short,” position of a
net 10,344 futures equivalents in the week ended Jan. 10,
according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s
Commitments of Traders report on Jan. 13.  Natural gas plunged 13 percent last week on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the biggest decline since August 2009,
after forecasts showed above-average temperatures through
January. Stockpiles in the week ended Jan. 6 stood at 3.377
trillion cubic feet, 17 percent above the five-year average, the
U.S. Energy Department reported on Jan. 12.  “The funds that got short are feeling good right now,”
 Kyle Cooper , director of research for IAF Advisors in Houston,
said in a telephone interview on Jan. 13. “As long as it stays
this warm, prices have to go lower. With this type of weather,
the storage surplus becomes catastrophic.”  Natural gas for February delivery fell 5.2 cents to $2.941
per million British thermal units on the Nymex in the week
covered by the report and dropped another 9.2 percent to $2.67
on Jan. 13, the lowest settlement price since Sept. 3, 2009.  The contract fell for sixth day today, dropping 12.2 cents,
or 4.6 percent, to $2.548 at 10:59 a.m. in New York.  Seasonal Record  Storage slipped  95 billion  cubic feet in the week ended
Jan. 6, compared with a five-year average decline of 128
billion, the Energy Department reported. Inventories rose to an
all-time high of 3.852 trillion cubic feet on Nov. 18.  Supplies may reach a  seasonal  record of 2.4 trillion cubic
feet in March, which is when heating demand usually ends and
producers begin piping more gas into storage, Cooper said.
Unless production falls or cold weather bolsters demand, prices
will drop to $2.40 per million Btu, and perhaps below $2, as gas
overflows storage caverns and clogs pipelines, he said.  “This is a situation that has never been seen before,”
Cooper said. “If we hit 2.4 trillion, you’re looking at storage
capacity constraints by July or August where you literally have
system problems because the system is so full.”  Mild Weather  U.S. gas production will rise to an all-time high next year
amid rising output from shale formations, according to Energy
Department estimates. Marketed gas output will average 67.34
billion cubic feet a day in 2012, up 2.2 percent from this year,
the department’s Energy Information Administration said in its
Jan. 10  Short-Term Energy Outlook .  Forecasts have shown higher temperatures,  Matt Rogers ,
president of Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland ,
said in a Jan. 13 telephone interview. His predictions for
January heating degree days, a measure of demand for fuel during
cold weather, fell by 115, or 12 percent, to 822 from his Dec.
30 estimate of 937.  “It’s nowhere close to what we were expecting,” Rogers
said. “It’s making everyone question whether there will be any
cold weather this winter.”  Heating demand will be 4.4 percent below normal in the U.S.
through Jan. 20, and 6 percent below normal in New York,  David Salmon , a meteorologist with Weather Derivatives in Belton,
 Missouri , said in a report to clients on Jan. 13.  About 51 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to the Energy Department.  Managed Money  Hedge funds and other large speculators, including
commodity pools and commodity-trading advisers, switched in the
week ended Jan. 10 from a  net-long position  of 14,318 the
previous week. The measure includes an index of four contracts
adjusted to futures equivalents: Nymex natural gas futures,
Nymex  Henry Hub  Swaps, Nymex Henry Hub Penultimate Swaps and ICE
Henry Hub Swaps. Henry Hub, in Erath,  Louisiana , is the delivery
point for Nymex futures, a benchmark price for the fuel.  In other markets, funds increased oil  wagers  on rising
prices by 1,365 to 201,672 contracts in the seven days ended
Jan. 10.  They boosted positions in  gasoline  to the highest in
records going back to 2006. Bullish bets advanced by 3,929
futures and options combined, or 5.8 percent, to 71,282 in the
week ended January 10, the CFTC said. Bets that  heating oil  will
rise increased by 3,841 futures and options combined, or 15
percent, to 30,103, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
