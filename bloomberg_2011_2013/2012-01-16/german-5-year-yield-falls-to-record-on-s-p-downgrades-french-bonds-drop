Portuguese bonds led declines in the
debt of Europe’s non-AAA rated nations after  Standard & Poor’s 
cut its  credit rating , as well as that of eight other euro-area
countries.  French two-year notes gained as the nation prepares to
auction as much as 8.7 billion euros ($11 billion) of bills.
 France  joined  Austria  in being stripped of its top rating by S&P
after government bond markets closed last week, leaving  Germany 
with the euro region’s only stable AAA grade.  Portugal ’s credit
rating was cut two levels to BB with a negative outlook.
Citigroup Inc. said Portugal will be removed from the bank’s
European Government Bond Index.  The declines are “a function of Portugal’s absolute rating
now which sees it dropping out of various indices,” said Eric Wand, a fixed income strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets
in  London . “The situation has brought home that politicians
need to get their act together. By keeping a whole swathe of
nations on negative outlook, this keeps the pressure on the ECB
to keep buying.”  Portugal’s 10-year yield advanced 101 basis points, or 1.01
percentage point, to 13.47 percent at 910:23 a.m. London time,
its biggest intraday surge since July 4. The 3.85 percent
security due April 2021 fell 3.435, or 34.35 euros per 1,000-
euro face amount, to 50.78.  That increased the yield difference, or spread, between the
securities and similar-maturity German bunds by 1 percentage
point to 11.69 percentage points.  ECB Bond Purchases  Volatility on Portuguese sovereign debt was the highest in
euro-area markets today, according to measures of 10-year bonds,
two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps. The
move in the 10-year yield was 8.7 times the 90-day average.  German five-year  yields  were little changed at 0.75 percent
after matching a record low 0.733 percent. Ten-year bunds,
 Europe ’s benchmark security, yielded 1.77 percent.  Italian 10-year yields were nine basis points higher at
6.73 percent after climbing as much as 22 basis points. Spain’s
benchmark 10-year yield added three basis points to 5.25
percent.  Italian and Spanish bonds pared declined after the ECB was
said to buy the securities, according to four people with
knowledge of the transactions, who declined to be identified
because the deals are confidential.  France and Austria were cut one level to AA+ from AAA and
face the risk of further reductions, S&P said on Jan. 13. While
Finland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg kept their AAA ratings,
they were put on negative outlook.  Spain  and  Italy  were also
among the nine nations downgraded.  ‘In The Price’  “So much as S&Ps previous warning was already in the
price, the fact that France escaped a two-notch downgrade stands
to limit any possible underperformance,”  Richard McGuire , a
senior fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International in
London, wrote in an e-mailed note.  French 10-year yields were little changed at 3.08 percent
and the yield on 10-year Austrian notes was also little changed,
at 3.07 percent.  Benchmark Greek bonds maturing in October 2022 advanced for
a fifth day as the nation’s government and its creditors prepare
to return to the negotiating table this week in an attempt to
revive stalled talks on a debt swap.  European officials and the nation’s creditors agreed in
October to implement a 50 percent cut in the face value of Greek
debt by voluntarily exchanging outstanding bonds for new
securities, with a goal of reducing  Greece ’s borrowings to 120
percent of gross domestic product by 2020.  Coupon Disagreement  The two sides, which broke off negotiations on Jan. 13,
have struggled to reach an accord on the coupon and maturity of
the new bonds to determine losses for investors, raising the
danger of a sovereign default. The yield on the 5.9 percent
security dropped 36 basis points to 34.01 percent. The price
rose to 20.74 percent of face value.  Bunds have handed investors a return of 0.4 percent this
year, after gaining 9.7 percent in 2011, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. French and Greek bonds have both advanced
0.1 percent and Portuguese debt has gained 5.2 percent, the
indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
