Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) ’s Lovefilm unit,
which streams movies and television to subscribers online,
signed a deal to offer  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  shows in the U.K.  Lovefilm will stream full seasons of shows from Disney’s
ABC unit including “Desperate Housewives,” “Happy Endings,”
“Grey’s Anatomy” and “Lost,” according to a statement today.  The service, branded ABC TV On Demand, will make shows
available for Lovefilm members after they run on British T.V.
Lovefilm has announced at least three content deals this month
to fend off competition from Netflix Inc., a U.S.-based
streaming company that started services in the U.K. and Ireland
last week. Globally, Netflix has about 10 times as many
customers as Lovefilm after dominating the U.S. market.  Amazon, based in  Seattle , rose 1.4 percent to $178.42 in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading on Jan. 13. Los Gatos, California-
based Netflix, which has declined 51 percent in the past 12
months, climbed 2.4 percent to $94.38.  To contact the reporter on this story:
