BYD Co. (1211) , the automaker partly owned
by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., rose to a two-month
high in  Hong Kong  after the People’s Daily today reported
 China ’s government will  exempt  three of the company’s electric
car models from vehicle-usage tax charges.  BYD  gained  as much as 6.7 percent to HK$22.20, the highest
intraday level since Nov. 15, before changing hands at HK$21.50
as of 1:45 p.m. in Hong Kong. The stock has risen 28 percent
this year, compared with a 3.1 percent increase in Hong Kong’s
benchmark Hang Seng Index.  As many as 42 electric passenger cars were exempted from
payment of vehicle-usage tax earlier this month amid efforts by
the Chinese government to encourage use of electricity and other
alternative energy in personal transportation. The existing
annual usage levy ranges between 60 yuan ($9.50) and 5,400 yuan
based on engine size.  BYD, which started sales of its E6 electric cars to
individual buyers in November, is counting on such vehicles for
future growth as it faces slowing demand and mounting
competition with gasoline-run autos. BYD sold a total of 309 E6
cars to taxi-fleet operators and individual motorists in the
first 11 months of last year, according to the  China Association
of Automobile Manufacturers .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
