The  New York Giants ’ upset of the
Green Bay Packers yesterday drew the best preliminary television
ratings for a National Football League second-round playoff game
on any network in 15 years.  The  Giants  entered the game 7 1/2-point underdogs against
the defending  Super Bowl  champion. New York quarterback Eli Manning passed for three touchdowns, and the Giants forced four
turnovers to end  Green Bay’s  13-game winning streak at Lambeau
Field with a 37-20 victory.  The game, on News Corp.’s  Fox network , was watched in an
average of 27.4 percent of homes in the top 56 U.S. television
markets, according to the network. The previous best for the
divisional round came in 1997 when the  Carolina Panthers  beat
the Dallas Cowboys 26-17 in a game televised by Fox that was
seen in 28.6 percent of U.S. homes, according to the network.  New York advances to the National Football Conference
championship game next weekend against the San Francisco 49ers
at Candlestick Park, with the winner playing the American
Football Conference champions, either the Baltimore Ravens or
 New England Patriots , in the Super Bowl on Feb. 5 in
Indianapolis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
