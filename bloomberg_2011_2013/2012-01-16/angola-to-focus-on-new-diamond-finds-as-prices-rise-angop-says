Endiama EP,  Angola â€™s state-owned
diamond company, will focus on finding new diamond deposits

investor interest in the industry, Angop said, citing Chairman
Antonio Carlos Sumbula.  The country plans to lower production when prices drop, the
state-run  news agency  cited Sumbula as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
