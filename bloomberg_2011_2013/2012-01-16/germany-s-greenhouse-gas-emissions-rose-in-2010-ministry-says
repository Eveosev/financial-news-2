Germany ’s greenhouse gas emissions
rose in 2010 as  Europe ’s biggest economy recovered from the
economic crisis, the Environment Ministry said.  Greenhouse gas emissions, mainly carbon dioxide from
fossil-fired energy production, increased 2.7 percent compared
with the year earlier, the ministry said today an e-mailed
statement.  The latest numbers available are 4 percent below 2008
levels and represent a 25 percent decrease over 1990 levels.
This puts Germany on course to reduce emissions 40 percent by
the end of this decade, the ministry said.  “We’re showing that economic growth and climate protection
can go hand in hand,” Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
