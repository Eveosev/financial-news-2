TowerPower, a joint venture between
 Kenya ’s Comcraft Group and Powergas International of the U.K.,
plans to build the East African nation’s first biomass power
plant, Business Daily reported.  The 11.5-megawatt facility will cost 1.8 billion shillings
($21 million) and will be built at Marigat, 220 kilometers (135
miles) northwest of Nairobi, the capital, the newspaper said.
The plant will be fueled by the Prosopis Juliflora tree, it
said, citing Damaris Akoth, an agronomist at TowerPower.  The company plans to build a second biomass plant at
Kinango, 420 kilometers northwest of Nairobi, at a cost of 2.1
