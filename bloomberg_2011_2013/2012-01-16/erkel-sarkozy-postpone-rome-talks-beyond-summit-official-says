The leaders of Italy, France and
Germany will probably delay planned talks on the euro-area debt
crisis until after the next European Union summit on Jan. 30, an
Italian government official said.  Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti , German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  and French President Nicolas Sarkozy were due to
meet in Rome on Jan. 20. The meeting was canceled at Sarkozy’s
request because of a scheduling conflict, the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity because the governments haven’t
announced the change yet, said today.  A French government official said earlier today that the
discussions may have to be rescheduled because of problems with
the coordination of agendas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
