The cost to hire the largest type of
dry-bulk commodity ship for a year fell 22 percent in two weeks,
the most since 2009, according to Clarkson Research Services
Ltd.  One-year time charters for capesize vessels slid to $17,000
a day in the two weeks ended Jan. 13, against $21,875 in the
prior period, according to figures from London-based Clarkson, a
unit of the worldâ€™s biggest shipbroker. That was the largest
two-week decline since March 13, 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
