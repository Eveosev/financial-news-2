TMX Group Inc. (X)  extended its control
of the Canadian market for equities trading in December after
taking market share from bank-owned Alpha Group and other
alternative trading platforms.  TMX, the Toronto Stock Exchange owner that’s facing a
C$3.73 billion ($3.66 billion) takeover bid from a group of
Canadian banks and pension funds, had 71 percent of the market
across its three venues last month, up from 65 percent in
November, according to monthly  statistics  from the Investment
Industry Regulatory Organization of  Canada .  Alpha, whose owners include Canada’s six largest banks, had
15 percent of the market by number of shares traded, down from
20 percent in November, IIROC said. Alpha halted trading for a
day last month due to technical issues.  The market share for CNSX Markets Inc.’s Pure Trading
platform also fell to 2.8 percent in December, from 4.3 percent
in November. TMX numbers include the Toronto Stock Exchange,  TSX
Venture Exchange  and TMX Select, the exchange owner’s
alternative trading system that began in July.  TMX’s  market share  slipped from a year earlier, when the
Toronto Stock Exchange and TSX Venture Exchange had 72 percent
of the market. TMX, which had 99 percent of  stock trading  at the
start of 2007, has seen its share decline with the emergence of
alternative trading systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
