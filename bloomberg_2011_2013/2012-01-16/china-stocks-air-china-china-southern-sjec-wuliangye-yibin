Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses as of the close.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, fell 38.39 points, or 1.7 percent, to
2,206.19. The  CSI 300 Index  declined 2 percent to 2,345.65.  Airlines stocks:  Air China Ltd. (601111)  (601111 CH), the nation’s
largest international carrier, dropped 1.7 percent to 6.56 yuan.
China Southern Airlines Co. (600029 CH), the nation’s biggest
carrier by fleet size, slid 2.5 percent to 4.72 yuan.  Chinese airline earnings may fall this year because of
slower growth and a possible increase in competition on domestic
routes caused by carriers paring overseas services, Vivian Tao
and Alan Wang, analysts at Citigroup Inc., said in a note today.
Carriers will also suffer from higher fuel costs, increased
wages, and slower yuan appreciation, they said.  SJEC Corp. (601313)  (601313 CH), an elevator manufacturer, dropped
11 percent from its offer price to 10.99 yuan on its first day
of trading.  Wuliangye Yibin Co. (000858)  (000858 CH), China’s second-biggest
maker of white liquor by market value, slumped 5.5 percent to
30.45 yuan, the most since May 17, 2010. Some liquor made by
Wuliangye failed tests conducted by the Guangdong Province
Administration for Industry & Commerce on the strength of
alcohol in the products, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported yesterday, citing the administration. It didn’t provide
further details.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Chan Tien Hin  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
