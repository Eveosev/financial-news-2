An increase in the losses, or the
size of the “haircut,” to be taken by Greek sovereign-debt
holders would hurt banks in the nation, Moody’s Investor’s
Service said in its Weekly Credit outlook.  The level of losses may be more than the 50 percent
initially planned by European officials, the report said.  “A disorderly default would probably set off a deposit
run, triggering the likely imposition of a moratorium on deposit
withdrawals by the Greek authorities” according to the report.  “A disorderly default could also be followed by an exit
from the euro area, accompanied by a return to a deeply devalued
national currency.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
