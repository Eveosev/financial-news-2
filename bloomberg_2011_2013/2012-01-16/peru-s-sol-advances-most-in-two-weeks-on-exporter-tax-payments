Peru ’s sol climbed the most in two
weeks as metal exporters paid local taxes, leading the central
bank to buy dollars to stem gains in the local currency.  The sol strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.6925 per dollar at
today’s close, from 2.6940 on Jan. 13, according to Deutsche
Bank AG’s local unit. That’s the sol’s strongest advance since
Jan. 3.  The sale of dollars by mining companies making monthly
profit tax payments led the central bank to buy $488 million in
the spot currency market last week to slow gains in the sol. The
bank  bought  dollars today as the companies continued to sell the
greenback, said Antonio Diaz, a Lima-based trader at Banco
Internacional del Peru.  “There’s been a good flow of dollar sales by the mining
firms, which has boosted local banks’ dollar holdings despite
the big purchases by the central bank last week,” Diaz said.  The central bank bought $2 million today and paid an
average 2.6920 soles per dollar, it said on its website.  Metals led by copper and gold account for two-thirds of the
Andean country’s sales overseas. The country’s total exports
rose 23 percent last year, according to the trade ministry.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 5.76 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The bond’s price fell 0.1 centimo to 113.87
centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
