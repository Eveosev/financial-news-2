Angola ’s foreign-currency reserves
rose 44 percent last year to reach $25.02 billion in December as
Africa’s second-biggest oil producer benefited from rising crude
prices, a document from Angola’s central bank showed.  Reserves climbed from $17.33 billion at the end of 2010,
according to the preliminary report from the Luanda-based Banco
Nacional de Angola obtained by Bloomberg News. The amount
increased in December from $23.27 billion in the previous month.  “Angola looks extremely well positioned to grow
sustainably going forward,” Stephen Bailey-Smith, head of
research for Africa at Standard Bank Plc in  London , said in a
phone interview.  Angola should continue to benefit from higher oil prices
and exports, which account for more than 90 percent of the
country’s foreign-currency earnings, Bailey-Smith said.  “We expect oil production to increase this year to 1.84
million barrels per day from about 1.69 million last year,” he
said. Angola may also record a  budget surplus  in 2012 of around
9 percent of gross domestic product, Bailey-Smith said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
