The zloty reached its strongest
level this year against the euro after Polish policy maker Jerzy Hausner was cited by the PAP newswire as saying that the central
bank may need to consider increasing borrowing costs.  The Polish currency appreciated as much as 0.6 percent to
4.3852 per euro, its strongest since Dec. 28, before paring the
gain to 0.4 percent as of 2:14 p.m. in Warsaw.  Interest-rate increases are “definitely more probable”
than rate cuts as inflation is likely to stay at “elevated”
levels, PAP quoted Hausner as saying today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
