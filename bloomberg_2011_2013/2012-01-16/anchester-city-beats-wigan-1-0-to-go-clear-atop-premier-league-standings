Manchester City  won 1-0 at last-
place Wigan to take a three-point lead over  Manchester United 
atop English soccer’s Premier League.  Edin Dzeko’s 22nd-minute header secured the victory at DW
Stadium last night that lifted City to 51 points. United has 48
points, with third-place Tottenham on 46. All 20 teams in the
elite division have now played 21 of the 38 games this season.  The victory, City’s first on the road in the league since
beating Queens Park Rangers on Nov. 5, followed back-to-back
defeats in domestic cup competitions.  “It was really important that we beat them after two
defeats in the cups,” City manager  Roberto Mancini  told his
team’s website. “It was a really important three points.”  City hosts Tottenham in five days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
