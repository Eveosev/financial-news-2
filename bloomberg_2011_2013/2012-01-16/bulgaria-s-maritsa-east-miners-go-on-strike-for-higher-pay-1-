Miners at Bulgaria’s Maritsa East
mining region, which services coal-fired power plants run by  AES
Corp. (AES)  and ContourGlobal LP., went on strike over demands for
higher pay.  The strike at the state-owned mines began at 8 p.m.
yesterday after the government rejected miners’ demands to raise
their wages to reflect increased output, union leader Valentin
Valchev said in an interview with state radio Horizont in Sofia
today. The mines produced 30 million metric tons last year, a
60-year record, according to their  website .  The Maritsa East mines produce 90 percent of Bulgaria’s
coal and service three power plants, including the state-run
Maritsa East-2, AES Galabovo AD and ContourGlobal Maritsa East-
3, which produce 25 percent of the country’s electricity output,
according to their website.  “There is no threat of power shortages,” Delian Dobrev,
the deputy minister of Energy and Economy, told reporters in
Sofia today. “We’ll reduce exports and increase output from
other power plants.”  The Kozloduy nuclear power plant produces some 40 percent
of  Bulgaria ’s electricity output.  The mines’ management considers the strike illegal and has
filed a claim with the court in the southern city of Stara
Zagora, Evegeni Staikov, executive director of the Maritsa East
mines, told reporters in Sofia today. The strike will cause them
losses of 3 million lev ($2 million) a day, he said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
