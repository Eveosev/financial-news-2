Italy ’s government would make a
“wrong” decision should it hold an auction to sell six new
digital-television frequencies,  Mediaset SpA (MS)  Vice Chairman Pier Silvio Berlusconi told La Stampa in an interview.  “An auction would not only be wrong but unfair, as
elsewhere in Europe frequencies have been assigned for free,”
Berlusconi, the son of Italy’s former premier, told La Stampa.
“It would also be an unrealistic decision because the real
issue for our business is the heavy investments needed to create
competitive content, not the frequencies.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
