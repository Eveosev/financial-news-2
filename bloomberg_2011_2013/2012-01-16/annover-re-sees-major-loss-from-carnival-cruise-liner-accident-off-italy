Hannover Re expects the capsizing of
a  Carnival Corp. (CCL)  cruise liner off  Italy â€™s Tuscan coast to result
in a major loss for the German reinsurer, said company
spokeswoman Gabriele Handrick.  Hannover Re defines a major loss as 10 million euros ($12.7
million) or more, she said. It is too early to tell what the

company.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
