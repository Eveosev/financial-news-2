Remittances (PHWRTTLY)  by Philippine citizens
abroad increased at a faster pace in November, providing support
for  consumer spending  and the economy as exports fall.  The  funds  rose 10.6 percent from a year earlier to $1.78
billion, the central bank said in a statement in Manila today.
Remittances grew 6.2 percent in October.  Money sent home by the more than 8.5 million Filipinos
living overseas is equivalent to about 10 percent of the economy
and helps support sales by companies such as  Vista Land &
Lifescapes Inc.  President  Benigno Aquino  is increasing
 government spending  to a record this year in an effort to
sustain growth at home as the global economy falters.  “Stable flows would mean there’s still household
consumption,” Marc Bautista, head of research at Metropolitan
Bank & Trust Co. in  Manila , said before the report. “We’re
still seeing good spending and although there are concerns about
deployment, it’s not worrisome at this point.”  The peso dropped 0.5 percent to 43.92 per dollar at the
noon break, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The benchmark
Philippine Stock Exchange Composite Index fell a second day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
