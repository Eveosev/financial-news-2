Asian  stocks  fell the most in almost
a month, the euro touched an 11-year low versus the yen and
metals retreated after  Standard & Poor’s  stripped France of its
top  credit rating  and cut eight other euro-zone nations.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index tumbled 1.3 percent as of 1:52
p.m. in  Tokyo , the most since Dec. 19. Standard & Poor’s 500
Index futures sank 0.6 percent. The euro dropped 0.4 percent to

Australian 10-year bond yields fell 15 basis points to 3.69

Stability Facility’s 1.5 billion-euro sale tomorrow.  Europe ’s
debt crisis will inevitably affect  Asia , Hong Kong Chief
Executive Donald Tsang said.  Japan ’s Prime Minister  Yoshihiko
Noda  said containing the country’s public debt load, the world’s
largest, is critical.  “It’s going to be a couple of days of real uncertainty in
markets,” Jim McCaughan, the chief executive officer of Des
Moines, Iowa-based Principal Global Investors LLC, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview. The company oversees about $230
billion. “The Standard & Poor’s news was really rationalizing
what the market knew already, which is that the credit quality
of those countries is not what it was and the probability of
default is much higher.”  Ratings Cut  S&P warned on Jan. 13 that Europe’s efforts to fight its
crisis are falling short as it lowered the top ratings of  France 
and  Austria  one level to AA+. The New York-based company
downgraded  Italy , Portugal,  Spain  and Cyprus by two steps and
cut Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia by one level. It affirmed the
ratings of countries including  Germany ,  Belgium , and Ireland.  The euro fell as much as 0.5 percent to 97.04 yen, the
lowest since December 2000. The shared currency slid 0.3 percent
to $1.2647. Greek officials will reconvene with creditors on
Jan. 18 after discussions stalled last week over the size of
investor losses in a proposed debt swap, raising the threat of
default.  Japanese machinery orders rose 14.8 percent in November,
the most in almost four years, and data later today may show
 India ’s inflation eased to a two-year low, based on the median
economist estimate from a Bloomberg survey.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  has climbed 7.5 percent since a
two-year low in October and capped four weeks of gains on Jan.
13, the longest stretch in a year. The equity benchmark  trades 
at 12.2 times estimates earnings, 27 percent less than the six-
year average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nikkei, Kospi  Five stocks fell for each that gained in the MSCI Asia
index. Financial and technology companies  contributed  the most
to the decline in the gauge. Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
slid 1.5 percent and South Korea’s Kospi Index retreated 1.2
percent.  S&P 500 futures declined to 1,281.90.  Wells Fargo & Co . and
Citigroup Inc. are among companies to report quarterly results
this week. U.S. stock markets are closed for a holiday today.  “It’s unrealistic to expect Europe to make progress in
dealing with debt issues in a straight line without having
hiccups,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage about $1 billion
at Platypus Asset Management Ltd. in Sydney. S&P’s ratings
downgrades are “not going to help investor sentiment.”  China  Markets  The Shanghai Composite Index declined for a fourth day,
losing 0.6 percent and the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  tumbled 1 percent.
Data tomorrow will probably show that China’s economy grew 8.7
percent in the last three months of 2011, the slowest pace in 10
quarters, as export demand slumps and officials prolong a
campaign against property bubbles, according to the median
economist estimate from a Bloomberg survey.  The yuan retreated 0.13 percent, the most since Dec. 20, to
6.3145 per dollar, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The People’s Bank of China set the currency’s fixing

currency maintained its decline even after data showed home
loans rose for an eighth straight month in November. New
Zealand’s dollar weakened 0.2 percent to 79.31 U.S. cents.  Japan’s 10-year government bond yield fell one basis point
to 0.94 percent, matching the lowest rate since November 2010.  Limited Fallout  History suggests fallout from S&P’s ratings downgrades of
European countries may be limited. JPMorgan Chase & Co. research
shows that 10-year yields for the nine sovereigns that lost
their AAA status between 1998 and last year’s U.S. downgrade
rose an average of two basis points the following week.  French 10-year yields climbed four basis points on Jan. 13
to 3.08 percent. The  extra yield  investors demand to hold French
10-year debt instead of German bunds has widened to 131 basis
points, compared with an average of 69 basis points over the
past year.  Copper for delivery in three months declined as much as 1.1
percent to $7,909.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.

percent to $19,442 a ton.  Oil climbed 0.2 percent to $98.86 a barrel as signs that
Europe’s debt crisis is worsening were offset by Iran’s call for
support to defy a ban on its crude exports. Mohammad-Ali
Khatibi, Iran’s OPEC governor, said support by Arab producers of
a European import embargo would be a “dangerous political
game,” according to the Shargh newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
