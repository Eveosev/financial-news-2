Vietnam ’s three-year bonds gained on
speculation investors have more funds to buy debt following cash
injections by the central bank. The dong was little changed.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam added a net 54.5 trillion dong
($2.6 billion) last week via open-market operations, after
withdrawing 4 trillion dong in the prior period, according to
Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst at Viet
Capital Securities.  “Bonds gained because some banks probably have surplus
cash and wanted to invest in the securities,” Phong said.  Yields (GGVN5YR)  on three-year debt fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 12.43 percent as of 4:17 p.m. in Hanoi,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong was little changed at 21,035 per dollar, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the
reference rate at 20,828, its website showed. The currency is
allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
official rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
