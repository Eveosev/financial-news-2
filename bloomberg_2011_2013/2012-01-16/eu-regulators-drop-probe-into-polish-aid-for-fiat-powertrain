European Union regulators dropped a
probe into  Poland ’s planned subsidies for Fiat Powertrain
Technologies SpA after the country reduced the grant.  Poland “will reduce the aid amount in order to respect the
limits,” the European Commission  said  in the EU’s Official
Journal.  The EU authority began an investigation last year into
Poland’s plans to grant aid of 40.9 million euros ($51.9
million) to help Fiat Powertrain build petrol engines in
Silesia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
