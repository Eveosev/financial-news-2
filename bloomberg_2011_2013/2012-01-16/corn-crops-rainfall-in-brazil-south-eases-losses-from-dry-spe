Rain on corn and soybean crops in
 Brazil ’s southernmost state is easing the harm from a drought
that parched fields in the past 10 weeks.  Showers have increased humidity in about 70 percent of corn
crops and 80 percent of soybean fields in Rio Grande do Sul
state since Jan. 13, Dulphe Pinheiro Machado Neto, a manager at
state crop-forecasting agency Emater, said today in a telephone
interview from the capital city of  Porto Alegre .  Crops in Rio Grande do Sul, which produces about 14 percent
of Brazil’s soybeans and 10 percent of the country’s corn, have
lacked enough humidity to develop properly since November
because of excessive heat and dryness caused by the La Nina
weather pattern. The state will harvest 38 percent less corn and
15 percent fewer soybeans than initially forecast because of the
drought, Emater said Jan. 12.  “Losses to corn are irreversible, but rains have prevented
further losses,” Machado Neto said. “Humidity also helped soy
crops, but we need to see more of that to start talking about a
recovery.”  Rio Grande  do Sul’s government declared a state of
emergency in 282 of its 496 cities, according to information on
the state civil defense department’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
