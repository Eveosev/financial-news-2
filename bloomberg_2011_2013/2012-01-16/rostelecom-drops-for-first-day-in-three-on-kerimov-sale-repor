OAO Rostelecom (RTKM) ,  Russia â€™s state-
controlled telecommunications operator, dropped for the first
day in three after Vedomosti reported billionaire Suleiman
Kerimov is in talks to sell his six percent stake.  The shares dropped 1 percent to 152.56 rubles as of 10:46
a.m. in Moscow, the biggest intraday fall since Jan. 11.  Rostelecom itself may buy back the shares from Kerimov, the
newspaper said, citing a person close to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
