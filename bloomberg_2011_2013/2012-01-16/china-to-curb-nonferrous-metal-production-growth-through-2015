China  will curb the expansion of
smelters producing nonferrous metals including copper and
aluminum in the five years through 2015 to reduce overcapacity
and energy consumption.  The country’s annual aluminum output will be capped at 24
million metric tons by 2015 and copper production at 6.5 million
tons, according to government plans posted on the  website  of
China Nonferrous Metals News. Lead output will be capped at 5.5
million tons and zinc at 7.2 million tons.  China, the world’s biggest user of aluminum, copper and
zinc, has stepped up efforts to slow metal production growth to
curb surging raw-material prices, protect the environment and
contain inflation. The government is also taking measures to
conserve electricity after missing its energy-reduction target
in the last five-year plan.  Aluminum production may rise 8.8 percent annually during
the period, while copper output may gain 7.3 percent a year,
according to the plans posted on the newspaper’s website.  By 2015, China will increase its bauxite capacity to
produce a total of 8 million tons of alumina, a semi-finished
product used to make aluminum, a year in Shanxi, Guizhou and
Guangxi provinces and overseas.  The nation plans to add 1.3 million ton of copper
concentrate capacity by 2015 by developing mines at home and
abroad and acquiring overseas assets.  China will also increase its annual lead and zinc output
capacity by 2.3 million tons each, while nickel concentrate
capacity will rise by 60,000 tons a year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
