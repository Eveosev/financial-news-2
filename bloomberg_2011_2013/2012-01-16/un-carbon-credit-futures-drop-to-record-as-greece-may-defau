United Nations emission credits
dropped to a record as  Bill Gross , who runs the world’s biggest
bond fund at Pacific Investment Management Co., said Greece is
heading for default, potentially dragging  Europe  into recession.  Certified Emission Reduction credits for December fell 5.6
percent to close at 3.36 euros ($4.26) a metric ton on  London ’s
ICE Futures Europe exchange. The contract was first offered on
March 14, 2008.  The European Union’s carbon market has the biggest demand
for UN greenhouse gas offsets.  Issuance of new credits  may rise
to 36 million tons this month, according to UN data compiled by
Bloomberg. That would be the fourth highest ever.  EU carbon permits fell 3.7 percent to 6.73 euros a ton,
their lowest close since Jan. 6 on ICE.  EU economic concerns and the sovereign-debt crisis may
drive carbon prices for the rest of 2012’s first quarter,  Trevor Sikorski , an analyst with Barclays Plc in London, said today in
an e-mailed report. Colder spells of weather may drive prices
higher via natural gas, power and coal contract prices, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
