Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,
Britain’s biggest government-owned bank, said it is still in
debt talks with U.K. clothing retailer Peacocks Stores Ltd.  “We have been and continue to be supportive of the
company. New investors willing to inject sufficient capital
could not be found,” RBS spokesman Erfan Hussain wrote in an
emailed statement today. “Each company restructure is judged on
its own merits, but clearly the difficult conditions retailers
face is an important factor.”  Cardiff, Wales-based Peacocks, which has 240 million pounds
($368 million) of debt, may go into administration “within
days,”  Reuters reported today , saying RBS had withdrawn from
the talks. The company has 611 Peacocks outlets and 394
Bonmarche stores in the U.K. and employs about 10,000 people,
Reuters reported.  “We continue to progress our restructuring discussions and
plans, with no decisions taken at this point,” Alex Brennan, a
spokesman for Peacocks based at Hudson Sandler Ltd., said in an
emailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
