Demand for ships that haul dry-bulk
raw materials may continue to weaken because of the New Year in
 China , the world’s biggest importer of  iron ore , according to RS
Platou Markets AS.  “As Chinese New Year holidays start next week and traders
and buyers are already pulling away from their desks, activity
levels could further slump the next fortnight, with any marked
return of activity only expected” after the celebrations, Rahul Kapoor, Singapore-based analyst for the investment bank, said in
an e-mailed note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
