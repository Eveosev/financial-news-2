The next coffee crop in  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer, may not be enough to meet domestic and
export demand even with record production forecast, according to
Escritorio Carvalhaes, a Santos, Brazil-based broker.  Coffee output in Brazil may rise to a record in the
2012-13 season starting in July as trees enter the higher
yielding half of a two-year cycle and rains boost yields, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said. Production is forecast at 49
million to 52.3 million bags, up from 43.5 million last year,
Conab, the ministry’s crop-forecasting agency, estimates.  “To meet current export and domestic demand, without
taking into account safety stocks re-building and annual growth
in global coffee consumption, Brazil will need average crops of
54 million bags,” the broker said in a Jan. 13 report.  Brazil exported a record 33.46 million bags of coffee last
year, according to data from the country’s Coffee Exporters
Council, known as Cecafe.  “Despite the historical record of shipments and
production, inventories both in producing and consuming
countries will remain at dangerously low levels,” the broker
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
