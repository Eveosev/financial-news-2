Hungary may receive about 30 billion
forint ($122 million) in a mobile frequency tender and the
telecommunications authority will probably award the frequency
to a group of state-owned companies, news website  Nol  said,
citing people in the market.  The authority may announce the final result of the tender
in the coming days, according to Nol.  The start of a new, state-owned mobile company will add
several tens of billions of forint to the  budget , Nol said,
citing an unidentified former Development Ministry official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
