Vietnam  Oil & Gas Group, a state-
owned oil producer, said revenue rose 28 percent to 320.6
trillion dong ($15.3 billion) in 2011 as it discovered new
offshore oilfields and put other ones into operation.  PetroVietnam, as the company is known, said crude oil
output reached 15.21 million metric tons last year, equal to
101.4 percent of its full-year target, according to an e-mailed
statement today.  In 2011, PetroVietnam discovered three oilfields and put
five new oilfields into operation, of which three are in Vietnam
and two are overseas, it said in the statement. Hanoi-based
PetroVietnam also said production from its Dung Quat oil
refinery of 5.43 million metric tons exceeded targets.  The company expects output of crude and condensate to reach
24.8 million metric tons this year, from 23.91 million metric
tons last year, according to the statement.  Crude production in 2012 may be 15.8 million tons while
revenue may total as much as 660 billion dong this year,
PetroVietnam said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
