There was no trading in the  Standard & Poor’s  GSCI  gauge  of 24
commodities and UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
because of the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday in the U.S.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas fell in New York, taking its decline in the
past six days to the biggest in more than five years, on
speculation that milder-than-average weather in the U.S. will
curb heating demand.  Natural gas for February delivery fell 12 cents to $2.555 a
million British thermal units on the Nymex and traded as low as
$2.54, the lowest since Sept. 4, 2009. Futures have declined
more than 16 percent in the past six days, the largest drop
since November 2006.  U.K. natural gas and electricity for this summer slumped as
supplies were ample, even as colder weather caused heating
demand to surge.  Gas for summer, the six months from April, slipped as much
as 1 pence to 51.6 pence a therm, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest since November 2010 and
equal to $7.90 a million British thermal units. Power for summer
fell 90 pence to 41 pounds ($62.69) a megawatt-hour, according
to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest since
April 2010.  U.K. natural gas: NI NUKMKT
