Johnson Wagner rallied for a two-
stroke victory at golf’s Sony Open in  Hawaii , the first full-
field event of the U.S. PGA Tour season.  Wagner, 31, shot a 3-under 67 in yesterday’s final round at
Waialae Country Club in Honolulu to finish at 13 under.
Americans  Sean O’Hair , Harrison Frazar and Charles Howell III
and Carl Pettersson of Sweden tied for second at 11 under.  Wagner, an American who was two strokes off the lead
entering the final round, receives $990,000 for his third career
victory. His previous PGA Tour titles came at last year’s
Mayakoba Golf Classic and the 2008 Shell Houston Open.  “I’m really excited, I worked really hard this
offseason,” Wagner, who missed the 36-hole cut for weekend play
at the Sony Open the past three years, said in a television
interview. “I kind of told everybody I was going to win early
this year and, man, it feels good to do it.”  The  PGA Tour  next moves to La Quinta,  California , for the
$5.6 million Humana Challenge from Jan. 19-22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
