The French government has “less
room for maneuver” on its budget, Moody’s Investors Service
said, adding that it’s still assessing its stable outlook on the
country’s top-rated debt.  “Relatively high levels of indebtedness, very high
government expenditure in relation to nominal GDP and important
structural fiscal deficits constrain the capacity for the
government to respond to future shocks and weigh on the
government’s fiscal strength,” Moody’s said in a “credit
opinion” today.  Moody’s statement follows  Standard & Poor’s  decision late
last week to strip France if its top  credit rating .  French Finance Minister  Francois Baroin  issued a statement
saying that Moody’s comment “confirms that the policies put in
place by the French government in favor of growth,
competitiveness and the control of public deficits are the right
ones to pursue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
