Malaysia’s ringgit retreated from
the strongest level in a month on concern Europe’s credit crisis
will slow Southeast Asia’s third-biggest economy.  The  MSCI Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares slid the most in
almost a month after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the ratings of nine
euro-region nations, including France, late last week.
Malaysia’s inflation cooled to 3.1 percent in December, the
least in nine months, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey before official data due
on Jan. 18. The government reported last week that export growth
and industrial production slowed in November.  “The downgrades validate existing fears everything isn’t
right in the euro zone,” said Radhika Rao, an economist at
Forecast Pte in Singapore. “That’s why Asian currencies are
weaker. I don’t see reason for  Bank Negara Malaysia  to come in
as of now.”  The ringgit dropped 0.4 percent to 3.1455 per dollar as of
4:06 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency reached 3.1260 on Jan. 13, the strongest
level since Dec. 8.  The yield on the government’s 3.434 percent bonds due
August 2014 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
3.01 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
