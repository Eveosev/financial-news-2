Joao Pereira Coutinho, the
Portuguese investor who sold his stakes in five Brazilian
shopping centers, plans to avoid investing in the country’s
real-estate market after prices rose to “historic” highs.  “Today our focus in  Brazil  is not in real estate,” he
said in an e-mailed response to questions. “The real-estate
market in Brazil is heated.”  Pereira Coutinho said he plans to keep investing in other
areas of Brazil’s “robust” economy after selling his share of
shopping centers in the states of  Rio de Janeiro , Paraiba and
 Sao Paulo  for 574.5 million reais ($322 million). His SGC SGPS
SA investment company holds a majority stake in  SAG Gest-
Solucoes Automovel Globais SGPS SA (SVA) , the Portuguese importer of
cars made by Volkswagen AG that also controls Brazilian car-
rental company  Unidas SA (UNID3) .  “The Brazilian economy has had very positive growth” and
that’s reflected in the property market, he said.  The  International Monetary Fund  estimated that Brazil’s
economy grew 3.8 percent last year, down from the 7.5 percent
pace in 2010 that was the biggest jump in two decades. The
country is preparing to host the soccer World Cup in 2014 and
the Summer Olympics two years later.  Pereira Coutinho still holds some real estate assets in
Brazil, he said without identifying them. His current plans for
Brazil include a clean energy project of “great dimension”
with  Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest producer of iron-ore. He
didn’t provide details of the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
