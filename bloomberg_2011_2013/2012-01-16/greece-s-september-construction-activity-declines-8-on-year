Greek public and private building
activity, measured by the number of permits issued, fell almost
8 percent in September from a year earlier, the  Hellenic
Statistical Authority  said.  The number of permits fell 7.7 percent to 3,663. The
surface area of planned buildings dropped 27 percent to 653,600
square meters and their volume fell 22 percent to 2.4 million
cubic meters, the agency said today in an e-mailed  statement .  Construction slowed most in western  Greece  and in the
central region of Thessalia and dropped almost 13 percent in
Athens and its metropolitan area. Private building nationwide
fell 7.1 percent.  Greece may reduce taxes for industries that have seen a
marked slowdown in economic activity such as real estate, the
Athens-based To Vima newspaper reported today.  Austerity measures agreed to in 2010 for 110 billion euros
($140 billion) of emergency loans, including a temporary special
property tax, have deepened Greece’s recession, as unemployment
has risen and people have spent less, including on building new
homes.  The prospects for construction in Greece remain “bleak”
with demand for building materials “all but evaporated” the
country’s largest cement producer,  Titan Cement Co. SA (TITK) , said in
November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
