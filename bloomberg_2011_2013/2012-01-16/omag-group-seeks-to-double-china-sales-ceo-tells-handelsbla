Homag Group AG (HG1)  seeks to double sales
in  China  in the long term, Chief Executive Officer Markus Flik
told  Handelsblatt  in an interview.  The Schopfloch, Germany-based maker of wood working
machinery, which generates sales of about 60 million euros ($76
million) in China, is investing 6 million euros in its Shanghai
unit, Flik told the newspaper.  The company is betting on Chinaâ€™s rising wages to spur more
companies to buy machines instead of relying on hand-made
production, Flik said.  Stefan Nicola in Berlin at +49-30-70010-6246 or
