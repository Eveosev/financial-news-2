Upasna Bhardwaj, an economist at  ING
Vysya Bank Ltd. (VYSB) , comments on India’s  inflation  rate, borrowing
costs. The wholesale-price index rose 7.47 percent in December
from a year earlier after a 9.11 percent gain in November, the
government said today. The median of 25 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey was for a 7.4 percent increase.  Bhardwaj spoke in a phone interview from Mumbai.  “The manufacturing sector data is showing a monthly
increase which is not acceptable for any softening of  interest
rates .  Core inflation  is also showing an uptick and that is a
cause of concern if we need easing of policy rates.  ‘‘The demand side pressures are not easing which the
central bank would be monitoring more closely.  ‘‘The central bank’s emphasis is going to be on inflation
for sustainable medium term growth. However, they are not
finding signs of considerable easing in the inflation
trajectory.  ‘‘Therefore, I don’t see any rate cut in the Jan. 24 policy
meeting. The earliest reduction we are expecting would be in
April.  ‘‘The central bank will have to continue with liquidity
easing measures because the situation is going to be tight. They
may step-up the bond purchases or reduce the  cash reserve
ratio .’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
