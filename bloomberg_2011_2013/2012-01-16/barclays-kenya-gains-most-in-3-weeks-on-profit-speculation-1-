Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd. ,  Kenya ’s
largest lender by market value, advanced the most in more than
three weeks on speculation full-year profit will increase.  The stock climbed as much as 5.3 percent before closing
trading 3.6 percent higher at 12.80 shillings by 3 p.m. in
Nairobi, the capital, the biggest gain since Dec. 21.  “People expect a good performance when they announce their
profit for 2011 because of the cost rationalization they
undertook,” Brenda Kithinji, a research analyst at Nairobi-
based Old Mutual Securities Ltd. said by phone today. “Barclays
is one of the stocks that have fallen below their valuation in
terms of price to earnings and price to book”.  The stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.89, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its ratio should be above 9,
Kithinji said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
