Rockhopper Exploration Plc (RKH) 
jumped to a 10-month high in London trading after a report that
 Cairn Energy Plc (CNE)  is in talks with the only company to have made
a potentially commercial oil find near the Falkland Islands.  Rockhopper rose as much as 12 percent to 309 pence, the
highest since March, and was at 304 pence as of 8:10 a.m.  The Sunday Times newspaper reported yesterday that Cairn is
in talks with Rockhopper, without saying where it got the
information. The Financial Times said today that discussions
last year didn’t lead to a deal, though talks could resume in
the next few weeks.  Rockhopper Chairman Pierre Jungels said last month the
company has a range of options for the Sea Lion prospect and
that it will open a data room to seek partners. The company
needs about $2 billion to develop the find off the islands that
 Margaret Thatcher  went to war to keep British in 1982.  Cairn Energy doesn’t comment on rumors, a spokesman, who
declined to be identified citing company policy, told Bloomberg
News by phone yesterday. Rockhopper spokesman Patrick d’Ancona
declined to comment.  Desire Petroleum Plc (DES) , which owns acreage next to
Rockhopper, climbed as much as 4.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
