Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) 
Chief Executive Officer Constantino de Oliveira Junior may
retain the Webjet SA brand to create an “ultra low-cost”
carrier, he said in an interview with O Estado de S. Paulo.  Constantino expects airlines to exercise better price
discipline in 2012 and said Gol and Webjet’s combined capacity
in seats per kilometer will probably vary by zero to 4 percent
this year, according to O Estado.  To contact the reporter on this story:
