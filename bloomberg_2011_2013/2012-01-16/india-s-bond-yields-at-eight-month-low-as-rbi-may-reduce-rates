India’s 10-year bonds declined on
speculation the government will exceed its fiscal deficit
target, spurring more borrowings from the market.  Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  aims to curb the fiscal
deficit within 4.6 percent of gross domestic  product  in the
fiscal year ending March. He has raised 11.44 billion rupees
from asset sales this year, or 3 percent of the budget target,
according to data provided by the Department of Disinvestment.
Wholesale  prices  increased 7.47 percent in December, the least
in two years, the commerce ministry said in a statement today.  “Bond yields are still vulnerable to rise although
inflation is cooling,” said Nagaraj Kulkarni, a Mumbai-based
fixed-income strategist at Standard Chartered Plc. “The key
risk to bonds is from worsening fiscal situation, particularly
if disinvestment target is not met.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.22 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.  Kulkarni forecasts the 10-year yield to touch 8.5 percent
by the end of March. The  shortfall  between revenue and spending
may be 5.6 percent of GDP in the current fiscal year, he said.  India  boosted its annual debt-sales target by 8.5 percent
last month to a record 5.1 trillion rupees.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
rose eight basis points to 7.95 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
