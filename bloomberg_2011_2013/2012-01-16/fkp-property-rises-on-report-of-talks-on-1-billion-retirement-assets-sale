FKP Property Group (FKP)  shares surged by
the  most  in almost 1 1/2 years after a media report that the
company may receive an offer for its A$1 billion ($1.03 billion)
retirement properties.  A large Chinese conglomerate has been in talks with  Mulpha
International Bhd (MIT) , FKP’s biggest shareholder, and may make an
offer for the retirement assets, the Australian Financial Review
reported today in its Street Talk column, without citing anyone.
The report didn’t name the potential bidder.  FKP jumped 11 percent to 62 Australian cents at the 4:10
p.m. close of trading in Sydney, the most since Aug. 28, 2009.  The company has had various discussions with third parties
on restructuring the retirement portfolio, FKP said in a
statement to the stock exchange after the market’s close.  “To date, none of these discussions have progressed to a
level of development which the company believes would require
disclosure,” according to the FKP statement.  Stockland (SGP) , FKP’s second-biggest investor with 14.5 percent
of shares, has first right of refusal over the retirement assets.
Stockland shares fell 2.1 percent to A$3.34.  To contact the reporter on this story:
