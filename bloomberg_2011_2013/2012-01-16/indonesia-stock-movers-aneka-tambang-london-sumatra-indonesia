Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  Indonesian trading . Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the close in Jakarta.  The  Jakarta Composite index  fell 0.7 percent to 3,909.69.  Nickel producers:  PT International Nickel Indonesia (INCO) 
, the nation’s biggest producer of the metal, declined
1.5 percent to 3,325 rupiah.  PT Aneka Tambang (ANTM)  , the
second largest, slid 1.2 percent to 1,700 rupiah. Nickel for
three-month delivery in  London  fell as much as 1.3 percent to
$19,355 a metric ton, dropping for a second day.  PT AKR Coporindo (AKR)  (AKRA IJ), a fuel and chemical distributor,
jumped 8.2 percent to 3,625 rupiah, closing at a record. The
shares gained on expectation the government’s plan to start
limiting the sale of subsidized fuel in April will improve the
company’s profit margin, said Ikhsan Binarto, an analyst at PT
Indo Premier Securities in Jakarta.  PT Bank OCBC NISP (NISP)  , owned by  Southeast Asia ’s
second-largest bank by assets Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.,
fell 7.7 percent to 1,080 rupiah, the biggest drop among banking
stocks. NISP fell after the stock’s 8.3 percent gain Jan. 13 was
deemed excessive, according to Joseph Pangaribuan, an analyst at
PT Samuel Sekuritas  Indonesia . NISP’s 14-day relative-strength
index, which measures how rapidly shares have gained or fallen
over a certain period, rose to 71 on Jan. 13. A reading of 70 or
above suggests to some investors the stock is poised to fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
