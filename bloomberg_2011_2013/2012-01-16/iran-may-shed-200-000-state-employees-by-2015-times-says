Iran  must transfer 10 percent of its
civil servants to the private sector by 2015 as part of long
term plans to reduce the size of government, the  Tehran Times 
reported, citing Lotfollah Forouzandeh, vice president for
management and human resources development.  Some 2 million employees are working in state-run
organizations, Forouzandeh said, according to the Tehran-based
newspaper.  Iran has privatized as many as 500 companies during the
last six years, Economy Minister Shamseddin Hosseini said in
August, according to the newspaper. The Iranian government
earned some $77 billion dollars by ceding shares of state-owned
companies to the private sector during this time, Hosseini said.  Iranâ€™s Supreme Leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  ordered the
government in 2006 to sell 80 percent of major state companies
to boost the economy, three-quarters of which was state-
controlled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
