A measure of banks’ reluctance to
lend to one another in  Europe  fell to the lowest in two months,
money markets show.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between euro
interbank offered rate and overnight index swaps, narrowed to 88
basis points at 9:45 a.m. in  London , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That’s the smallest gap since Nov. 17 and compares
with 89 basis points on Jan. 13.  The three-month cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was
unchanged at 86 basis points below Euribor. The gap shrank to as
little as minus 80 on Jan. 13, the narrowest in more than four
months.  The one-year cross-currency basis swap was 80 basis points
below Euribor from minus 76 on Jan. 13. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Overnight deposits  at the  European Central Bank  rose to an
all-time high as lenders parked 493 billion euros ($624 billion)
with the Frankfurt-based ECB on Jan. 13. Banks deposited 490
billion euros the previous day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
