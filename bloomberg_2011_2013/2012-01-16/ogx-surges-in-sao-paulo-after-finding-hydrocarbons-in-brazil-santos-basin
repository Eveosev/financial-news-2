OGX Petroleo (OGXP3)  & Gas Participacoes SA,
the oil company controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , said it found hydrocarbons in two separate sections of
a well it is drilling in shallow waters offshore Brazil.  OGX found hydrocarbons in the albian and aptian sections of
the 1-OGX-63-SPS well, also known as Fortaleza, in the BM-S-57
block, the company said in a regulatory filing today. OGX said
it found a reservoir about 110 meters (361 feet) thick in the
aptian section.  The Fortaleza well contains the thickest reservoir the Rio
de Janeiro-based company has found to date in the Santos Basin,
according to data on OGX’s website. OGX operates five
exploration licenses in  Santos Basin , where the company has 1.8
billion barrels of potential oil and natural-gas resources. OGX
has primarily discovered natural gas and condensates in the area
since it started drilling in 2010.  OGX rose 3.1 percent, or 44 centavos, to 14.60 reais in  Sao
Paulo  at 11:45 a.m., more than the 0.5 percent rise in Brazil’s
benchmark Bovespa stock index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
