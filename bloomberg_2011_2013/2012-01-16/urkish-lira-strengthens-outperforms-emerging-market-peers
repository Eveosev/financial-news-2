The lira rallied to a six-month high
against the euro amid speculation  Turkey ’s currency will
strengthen further as investors seek higher-yielding assets.  The Turkish currency advanced 0.5 percent to 2.3493 against
the euro at 6 p.m. in Istanbul, the biggest one-day gain
among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg after
the Russian ruble and South African rand. That took the lira to
its highest level since July 20. The lira rose 0.5 percent
versus the dollar to 1.8531.  The lira may appreciate to a fair value of 2.20 per euro,
Deutsche Bank AG said in a report on Jan. 12, citing an
“attractive” carry trade and “solid state finances.”
Turkey’s estimated total return is 4.9 percent by the second
quarter of 2012, the highest rate among developing nations,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We see investors based abroad continue to sell euros
versus the lira, there is demand for high-yielding currencies,”
Emir Baruh, a currency trader at Akbank TAS in Istanbul, said in
e-mailed comments.  The yield on Turkey’s 10-year bonds is 9.4 percent, the
second-highest in central and eastern  Europe  after  Hungary , data
compiled by Bloomberg shows. That compares with 1.8 percent for
the euro area and 1.9 percent in the U.S, the data show.  Turkey’s budget deficit narrowed to about 1.4 percent of
gross domestic product last year, the smallest gap since 2006,
from 3.6 percent in 2010, Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek said
today at a news conference.  The lira broke its 200-day moving average versus the euro
on Jan. 6 and has traded stronger than its 50- and 100-day
moving averages for the past month. The 200-day moving average
was 2.4043 today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Automatically traded portfolios sent orders to sell euros
for liras after the lira broke the 200-day average, Baruh said.  The Turkish central bank didn’t sell dollars today at its
daily auctions because of a U.S. holiday. The bank has sold at
least $15 billion since August to shore up the lira, which
dropped 18 percent last year in the biggest depreciation among
emerging-market currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
