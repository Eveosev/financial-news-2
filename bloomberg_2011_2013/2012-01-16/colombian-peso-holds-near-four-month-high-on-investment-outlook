Colombia’s peso fell for a second
day on speculation protests that have cut into the nation’s oil
production will lead to lower dollar inflows.  The peso erased earlier gains, declining 0.2 percent to
1,846 per  U.S. dollar  in the next-day market, according to the
stock exchange’s foreign-exchange electronic transactions
system, known as SET-FX. With markets closed in the U.S.,
Colombia’s currency trades in the so-called next-day market, in
which payment and delivery are made the following trading day.  Protesters have blockaded roadways and prevented workers
from entering the Cira Infantas field since this weekend,
reducing output, a company official from state oil company
Ecopetrol SA who can’t be identified because of corporate
policy, said today by telephone.  “There’s some concern about the oil protests given the
resulting reduced production,” said Omar Escorcia, an analyst
at Asesores en Valores SA brokerage in Bogota. “The oil
protests aren’t good news for  Colombia ’s investment
environment.” Oil accounts for about 40 percent of the
country’s total exports.  Foreign direct investment jumped 56 percent to $14.8
billion in 2011 from a year earlier, with 82 percent going into
oil and mining, according to preliminary trade balance data from
the central bank.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.37 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price fell 0.064
centavo to 120.934.  To contact the reporter on this story:
