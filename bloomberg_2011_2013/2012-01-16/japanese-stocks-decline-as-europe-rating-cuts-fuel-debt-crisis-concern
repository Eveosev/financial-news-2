Japanese  stocks  fell the most in a
month after  Standard & Poor’s  stripped France of its top  credit
rating  and cut eight other European countries, fueling concern
policy makers haven’t done enough to fight the debt crisis.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s top publicly
traded bank, sank 2.7 percent.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that
depends on Europe for almost a third of its sales, slid 2.2
percent.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , the nation’s largest oil explorer by
market value, fell 2.3 percent after crude prices declined.
Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. led declines among shippers after a
gauge of cargo rates dropped to an 11-month low.  “Europe’s crisis is gradually worsening,” said Koichi Kurose, chief economist in Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd., which
oversees the equivalent of $68 billion. “The ratings company
issued a warning to the Europe governments that their policies
are only kicking the can down the road.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 1.4 percent to 8,378.36
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, the biggest drop since Dec. 15.
The broader  Topix (TPX)  lost 1.3 percent to 725.24. Stocks also slid
as Europe’s leaders scrambled to restart stalled talks with
Greece’s creditors on the size of losses in a proposed debt swap.  The  Topix (TPX)  has declined 0.5 percent this year, compared with
a 2.5 percent gain by the  S&P 500  and a 1.9 percent increase by
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in  Japan ’s broadest benchmark
are valued at 15 times estimated earnings on average, compared
with 12.3 times for the S&P 500 and 10 times for the Stoxx 600.  U.S. Futures Drop  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 1 percent
today. The index lost 0.5 percent in  New York  on Jan. 13 before
S&P said it cut France’s debt rating one level to AA+, with a
negative outlook. Italy and Spain were cut two grades, while
Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, had its rating affirmed.  “The market has been expecting downgrades of France and
other European countries, but they can’t tell how much the
downgrades have already been priced in, which will likely drag
down stocks” said Norihiko Funatsu, a chief strategist in Tokyo
at Okasan Securities Co.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (8316)  lost 2.7 percent to 325 yen
and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., Japan’s No. 2 publicly
traded bank, fell 2.2 percent to 2,194 yen.  Attempts by European leaders to address economic woes
haven’t “produced a breakthrough of sufficient size and scope
to fully address the euro zone’s financial problems,” S&P said.
The region continues to face tightening credit conditions among
other problems, S&P said.  Exporters to Europe declined. Canon lost 2.2 percent to
3,280 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which depends on Europe for a fifth of
its sales, declined 2.3 percent to 1,297 yen.  The euro weakened for a second day, reaching an 11-year low
versus the yen. The shared currency depreciated to 97.04 yen
today, the lowest since December 2000.  ‘Negative Impression’  “Exporters that depend on  Europe  can’t avoid taking an
earnings hit from the weaker euro,” said  Yoshinori Nagano , a
senior strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $104 billion. “The downgrades give a negative
impression psychologically, but it’s unlikely the news will make
the situation keep getting worse.”  Greek officials will reconvene with creditors on Jan. 18
after discussions stalled last week over the size of investor
losses in a proposed debt swap, raising the threat of default.
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President Nicolas Sarkozy will also meet as the  European Central Bank  warns
governments against “watering down” a revamp of budget laws.  Machinery Orders Jump  Stocks fell today even after Japan’s machinery orders
surged the most since Jan. 2008. Bookings, an indicator of
future  capital spending ,  rose  14.8 percent in November from a
month earlier, the Cabinet Office said in  Tokyo  today.
Economists predicted a 5.1 percent increase.  Energy companies declined. Inpex slid 2.3 percent to
504,000 yen. Japan Drilling Co., an offshore drilling contractor,
dropped 2.2 percent to 2,177 yen.  Crude oil for February delivery fell 0.4 percent to $98.70
a barrel in New York on Jan. 13, the lowest settlement since Dec.
21. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six metals
including copper and aluminum lost 0.3 percent, its first drop
since Jan. 5.  Shipping companies declined the most among the 33 Topix
industry groups after the  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a measure of
shipping costs for commodities, sank 4.7 percent on Jan. 13 to
the lowest close since Feb. 7, falling in each of the last 18
trading sessions.  Mitsui O.S.K. (9104)  sank 3.9 percent to 247 yen. Smaller Kawasaki
Kisen Kaisha Ltd. lost 3.8 percent to 126 yen. Nippon Yusen K.K.,
Japan’s top shipping line by sales, fell 2.8 percent to 175 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
