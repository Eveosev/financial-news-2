The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate debt fell, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 16.5
basis points to 710.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. 4:30
p.m. in London. A decline signals improvement in perceptions of
 credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 4.75 basis points to 167 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers decreased 4.5 basis points to 266 and
the subordinated index dropped six to 479.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.7 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
