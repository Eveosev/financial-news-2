South Korea’s inventories of
liquefied natural gas rose to 80 percent of storage capacity in
December as warmer weather reduced demand for heating in the
country, according to two officials at state-run  Korea Gas Corp. (036460)   Stockpiles are up from 60 to 70 percent in the same month a
year earlier, according to the officials, who declined to be
identified because they aren’t authorized to speak to the media.
Korea can store about 3.97 million metric tons of the fuel,
including 3.6 million tons held by the state utility and 365,000
tons by  Posco (005490) , according to data from the companies.  The average temperature in Seoul was minus 0.9 degree
Celsius (30.4 degrees Fahrenheit) in December, compared with
minus 1.3 degrees Celsius in the same month in 2010, according
to the Korea Meteorological  Administration .  Imports of the fuel by South Korea, the world’s second-
biggest buyer, rose 47 percent from a year earlier to 4.81
million tons in December, according to data on the Korea Customs
Service’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
