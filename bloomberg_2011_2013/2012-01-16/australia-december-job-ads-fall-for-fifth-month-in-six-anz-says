Australian job notices declined in
December for the fifth time in six months as companies delayed
personnel decisions during a bout of global financial turmoil, a
private report showed.  Jobs advertised  in newspapers and on the Internet fell 0.9
percent last month after rising a revised 0.1 percent in
November, according to an  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd . report released in Melbourne today.  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia cut  interest rates  in
November and December in the first back-to-back reductions in
two years, lowering the benchmark to 4.25 percent to boost
demand as inflation pressure eased. Hiring has weakened this
year from a record in 2010 as Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis
weighs on global growth.  “A further modest rise in the unemployment rate, together
with continued heightened global risks, should keep domestic
inflationary pressures relatively benign for now,”  Katie Dean ,
head of Australian economics at ANZ Bank, said in a statement.
“This will provide the RBA with further scope to provide
another modest easing of monetary policy.”  National vacancies advertised in newspapers dropped 1.1
percent in December, and Internet notices rose 3.5 percent,
today’s report showed.  Australia ’s  unemployment rate  likely held at 5.3 percent in
December as employers added 10,000 jobs, a government report
will show on Jan. 19, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 23
economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
