The Ghana Cocoa Board plans to
revoke the licenses of four cocoa-buying companies for failing
to meet minimum purchases of 2,000 metric tons per season,
Business and Financial Times reported, citing the regulator.  Duapa Buyers Ltd., Ghana Co-Operative Marketing
Association, Farmers Alliance Ltd. and Abapa Golden Ltd. didnâ€™t
meet the requirement for the 2010-11 season, the Accra-based
newspaper said.  There are 27 licensed companies that buy  cocoa beans  from
farmers on behalf of the board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
