UPM-Kymmene Oyj (UPM1V) ,  Europe ’s second-
largest papermaker, rose the most in a week after closing down a
paper mill in Albbruck, Germany.  UPM  gained  as much as 3.8 percent in intraday trading,
adding 0.34 euros, to 9.25 euros at 3:42 p.m. in Helsinki,
giving the company market value of 4.8 billion euros ($6.1
billion).  “The mill has been unprofitable for several years due to
its age and small size of machines,” Duncan Lake, analyst at
Royal Bank of Scotland in  London , said in a note to clients. He
has a “neutral” rating on the stock. “We see this as a
positive in the longer term for the industry which has been
suffering structural capacity.”  UPM will cut 508 jobs on Jan. 31 at the mill that had
capacity of 320,000 tons of magazine paper. Shuttering the
Albbruck plant finalizes the paper capacity reductions announced
last August, the Helsinki-based company said in a statement
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
