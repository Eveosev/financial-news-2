Hungary hasn’t bought out private
investors from public-private projects so far and won’t have the
financial resources to do so in 2012 either,  Napi Gazdasag 
reported, citing the Development Ministry.  Terminating the “unfavorable” PPP projects would cost the
country about 200 billion forint ($813 million), excluding
highways, the Budapest-based newspaper said.  The government remains committed to ending these projects,
the ministry said, according to Napi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
