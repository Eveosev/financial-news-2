German Interior Minister  Hans-Peter Friedrich  has banned the use of  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPhones and  Research
in Motion Ltd (RIM)  BlackBerrys by his ministry employees because the
servers linked to the devices are located in the U.S.,  Bild-
Zeitung  reported, citing unnamed intelligence officials.  Confidential information may fall into the wrong hands, the
newspaper cited the officials as saying. Friedrich and his staff
are using phones made by  HTC Corporation (2498)  that run with a special
software supplied by the Federal Office for Information
Security, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
