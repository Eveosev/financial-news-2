PBG SA (PBG) , Poland’s third-largest
building company, extended gains to become the best-performing
stock in Warsaw’s benchmark index this year as Chief Executive
Officer Jerzy Wisniewski announced plans to raise his stake.  PBG climbed as much as 2.4 percent to 81.85 zloty and
traded 2.1 percent higher at 81.6 zloty as of 1:35 p.m. in
