Australian banks may scrap 7,000
jobs in the next two years as the nation’s lenders cut costs
that account for 58 percent of expenses to offset the weakest
credit growth since World War II, according to  UBS AG. (UBSN)   Lenders will reduce total staff numbers by 3.9 percent to
172,000 from 179,000, Sydney-based UBS analysts Jonathan Mott,
 Chris Williams  and Adam Lee said in a note to clients dated Jan.
13. Those figures don’t include  Australia  & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd.’s Asian staff, they said.  The focus on employment costs at banks, which are among
major employers in the biggest cities of Sydney and  Melbourne ,
mirror the challenge faced around the world by lenders battling
slower revenue growth amid weak household and business
confidence. ANZ Bank, the third biggest in Australia by market
value, is preparing to cut as many as 900 jobs in coming months,
the union that represents bank workers said last week.  “We expect the banks to be heavily focused on their cost
bases,” the UBS analysts said. “Solid reductions in headcount
and discretionary costs are anticipated as banks react to the
lower growth environment.”  Shares of  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , the nation’s
biggest lender, fell 1.1 percent in Sydney today.  Westpac (WBC) 
Banking Corp., the No. 2 lender, slipped 1.5 percent, ANZ Bank
shed 1.6 percent and  National Australia (NAB)  Bank Ltd. declined 1.6
percent.  Commonwealth, Westpac  Commonwealth Bank said in an e-mailed statement to
Bloomberg that it has “no target or short-term plan for major
staff reductions.” The bank may make redundancies “from time
to time in some areas, while in other areas more staff may be
needed,” it said.  Westpac “expects there will be a decrease in staff numbers
this year, but we have no specific targets,” the bank said in
an e-mailed statement from spokeswoman Supreet Gosal.  National Australia expects staff numbers to “fluctuate in
various parts of the business” as it completes and outsources
some projects and continues to “focus on efficiency,”
Melbourne-based spokesman  Brian Walsh  said in an e-mailed
statement.  Kevin Foley , an  ANZ Bank (ANZ)  spokesman in Sydney, said in an e-
mailed statement that “there is some belt tightening going on
in response to difficult market conditions.”  UBS continues “to be cautious on the outlook for credit
growth” and doesn’t expect a “significant pickup in the
housing market,” the note said.  Rate Cuts  To help spur borrowing, the central bank lowered the
benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point on Nov. 1 and Dec.
6 as  Europe ’s debt crisis dimmed prospects for global growth.  Zurich-based UBS estimates housing credit grew from 1977 to
2010 at a 14 percent annual pace, and is currently expanding at
5.7 percent, the weakest rate since World War II.  “We anticipate housing credit growth to continue to remain
subdued, probably staying in the 4 to 6 percent range for some
time,” the analysts said.  Australia’s banks in recent years became “more lax” in
managing staff numbers as they invested to meet expanding demand
for lending, after reducing headcount to 141,000 in 2002 from
166,000 in 1996, according to UBS.  Among Australia’s so-called big four lenders, ANZ Bank
employees individually delivered the least profit, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg and company reports. ANZ Bank made
A$109,424 ($112,389) in net income from each employee in the
year ended September 2011. That compared with A$138,819 at
 Commonwealth Bank (CBA) , A$185,379 at Westpac, and A$116,900 at
National Australia, the data show.  Best Performers  Still, Australia’s banks were among the best-performing
lenders in the world last year. While shares of banks in the
U.S. fell 13 percent,  Japan ’s lenders lost 23 percent and
Europe’s slumped 34 percent, Australian banks fell 7 percent,
according to UBS. Only Canadian lenders fared better, limiting
their 2011 decline to 3 percent.  Reducing headcount to 172,000 “should help absorb
underlying wage increases keeping total staff expenditure growth
to around 1 percent per annum,” the UBS analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
