The U.K. Treasury and North Sea oil
companies are studying plans for tax relief on dismantling
oilfields to attract investment in decommissioning the sites.  Government officials met with industry representatives
today for the first time since setting up the so-called Fiscal
Forum in September to discuss taxes and ways to spur investment
in marginal fields, the Treasury said in an e-mailed statement.  “The government committed to working with industry with
the aim of announcing further, long-term certainty on
decommissioning at budget 2012,” it said. The authorities will
consider introducing a new category of field that would qualify
for a field allowance, it said.  Last year, the oil industry criticized a U.K. tax increase
on oil producers’ profits to 62 percent from 50 percent. In
March, Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  also said he
was considering reducing the tax relief on dismantling
operations, known as decommissioning.  Oil and natural-gas projects on the U.K. continental shelf
will attract investments in the next three years as crude prices
top $100 a barrel,  Wood Mackenzie Consultants Ltd.  said Jan. 10.
Energy explorers spent a record 7.5 billion pounds ($11.5
billion) on U.K. projects in 2011, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
