French 10-year  government bonds 
rose, pushing the yield on the securities down four basis points
to 3.04 percent at 2:15 p.m. London time, after borrowing costs
at a sale of treasury bills fell.  The nation’s two-year note yield dropped six basis points
to 0.65 percent.  France sold 1.895 billion euros of 51-week notes at a yield
of 0.406 percent, down from 0.454 percent on Jan. 9, the first
sale since a rating downgrade by Standard & Poor’s. The
Treasury also sold 4.503 billion euros of three-month notes and
2.192 billion euros six month bills. Yields fell on both.  To contact the reporter on this story:
