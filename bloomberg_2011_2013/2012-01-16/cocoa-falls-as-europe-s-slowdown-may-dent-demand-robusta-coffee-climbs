Cocoa fell for a third day in  London 
on speculation  Europe ’s economic slowdown is curbing demand and
as exports from Nigeria, the world’s fourth-largest producer,
are set to resume. Robusta coffee and white sugar advanced.  Cocoa-bean processing in Europe rose 1.8 percent in the
fourth quarter, the European Cocoa Association said Jan. 13.
That was below the 7.5 percent estimate from analysts and
traders in a Bloomberg News survey and the third quarter’s 14
percent increase. Nigeria will resume cocoa exports
“immediately” after a national strike was called off, Olakunle
Akingbola, a business manager at Lagos-based Cobalt
International Services, said by phone today.  “Expectations of robust demand for cocoa in Europe were
disappointed,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in
 Frankfurt , wrote in a report e-mailed today. “The cooling of
demand is not sufficient to give additional buoyancy to prices,
given that a moderate market surplus had already been
anticipated for the 2011-12 season.”  Cocoa for March delivery slid 2 percent to settle at 1,481
pounds ($2,269) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in London. The ICE
Futures U.S. exchange, where cocoa, raw sugar and arabica coffee
trade in  New York , is closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.  The global cocoa market will have a “modest surplus” in
the current season, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report e-
mailed Jan. 13. It forecast prices for the beans traded in New
York of $2,450 in three to 12 months, compared with the close of
$2,269 a ton for the March contract on Jan. 13.  Standard & Poor’s  on Jan. 13 cut credit ratings for nine
euro-region nations including France.  Robusta coffee for March delivery gained 1.2 percent to
$1,854 a ton in London. White, or refined, sugar for March
delivery rose 0.5 percent to $625.50 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
