Ukraine’s grain exports won’t exceed
12 million metric tons from now until the end of June, possibly
missing the government’s target for the whole season, said
Volodymyr Klymenko, head of the country’s Grain Association.  The state target of 26 million tons for the marketing year
ending in June won’t be attained because of “inappropriate
government policies,” Klymenko told reporters today in capital
Kiev. Exports were 9.45 million tons so far this season,
according to government figures, bringing the total to 21.45
million tons including Klymenko’s estimate.  Grain producers and exporters are getting too few freight
cars from state managed railroad operator Ukrzaliznytsya,
according to Klymenko. Some traders are getting only 30 percent
of their needed cars, he said.  Ukraine’s grain exports advanced to 9.45 million tons this
season, up from 6.79 million tons a year earlier, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement today.
Ukraine had grain export quotas from October 2010 through May
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
