Cracker Barrel Old Country Store
Inc. (CBRL)  said founder Dan Evins died Jan. 14 in Lebanon,  Tennessee .
He was 76.  Evins opened the first Cracker Barrel location in Lebanon
in 1969 and the chain, which is still based there, now owns 608
locations in 42 states, the company said today in a statement.
He served as chief executive officer until 2001 and chairman
until 2004, when he retired and became chairman emeritus.  Cracker Barrel, which runs country store-themed restaurants
with attached gift shops, was criticized last year by
shareholder Sardar Biglari, who said the company didn’t disclose
enough financial data. Biglari’s attempt to gain a seat on the
board failed in December. He owned 13 percent of Cracker Barrel
as of Jan. 13, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Cracker Barrel rose 0.2 percent to $52.73 on Jan. 13 in  New
York . The shares fell 8 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
