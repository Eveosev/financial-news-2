Speculators increased wagers on
rising commodities to the highest level since November just as
prices headed for the biggest three-day slide in almost a month.  Money managers expanded combined net-long positions across
18 U.S. futures and options by 7.2 percent to 719,991  contracts 
in the week ended Jan. 10, Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data show. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw
materials fell 2.5 percent in the following three days.  While the index rose 14 percent from a 10-month low in
October, prices dropped last week after the U.S. government
predicted supplies of corn and soybeans that were bigger than
anticipated by analysts. A report on U.S. retail sales fell
short of forecasts while jobless claims exceeded estimates. The
dollar rose to a 15-month high, increasing the cost of dollar-
denominated raw materials outside the world’s biggest economy.  “The recovery is modest,” said Adrian Day, who manages
about $180 million of assets as the president of Adrian Day
Asset Management in Annapolis,  Maryland . “Is it too early to
say we’ve seen the turn? Probably. I’m not buying at these
prices after the rallies we had the past few weeks.”  The S&P  GSCI (SPGSCI)  fell 1.6 percent last week, the biggest drop
in a month. The MSCI All-Country World  Index (MXWD)  of equities rose 1
percent, with about $750 billion added to the value of global
stocks. The U.S. Dollar Index, a measure against six trading
partners, rose 0.3 percent, and the yield on 10-year Treasuries
fell 0.09 percentage point to 1.86 percent, the lowest in more
than three weeks, Bloomberg Bond Trader prices show.  Natural Gas Slide  Eleven of the 24 raw materials tracked by the S&P GSCI
gauge declined last week, led by a 13 percent drop in natural
gas. Corn fell 6.8 percent, the most since the end of September,
wheat retreated 3.6 percent and soybeans 3.2 percent. Natural
gas fell as much as another 4.9 percent today to a two-year low.  Sales at U.S. retailers climbed 0.1 percent in November,
missing economist forecasts for a 0.3 percent gain, the Commerce
Department said on Jan. 12. U.S. jobless claims climbed 24,000
to a greater-than-expected 399,000, the Labor Department said
the same day.  “Everybody came into the New Year feeling good, and maybe
things got a little ahead of themselves,” said Shonda Warner,
the managing partner of Chess Ag Full Harvest Partners in
Clarksdale,  Mississippi , which oversees about $75 million of
assets.  Agriculture Holdings  A measure of 11 U.S. farm goods showed speculators raised
bullish wagers in agricultural commodities by 8.7 percent, a
third consecutive gain, to 400,979 contracts, the highest since
the week ended Nov. 8. The bets came before a Jan. 12 report
that showed U.S. supplies of corn and soybeans were bigger than
forecast after ample harvests and slowing demand. The U.S. was
the world’s top grower and exporter of both crops last year.  Corn  stockpiles  may total 846 million bushels before this
year’s harvest, 12 percent more than analysts expected, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said. Soybean inventories on Aug. 31,
before this year’s harvest, will be 20 percent larger than
forecast last month at a five-year high of 275 million bushels.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its three-month corn forecast
to $6.30 a bushel from $6.85 on Jan. 12, citing the USDA report.
The grain closed 2 percent lower at $5.995 the following day.
The bank also trimmed its three-month outlook for soybeans to
$12.15 a bushel from $12.20 and its wheat estimate to $6.20 a
bushel from $6.70. Soybeans closed at $11.5825 on Jan. 13 and
wheat $6.0225.  Goldman ‘Overweight’  The bank reiterated an “overweight” recommendation on
commodities over the next 12 months, predicting a 15 percent
gain in the S&P GSCI Enhanced Commodity  Index. (MXWD)   Investors put $537 million into commodity funds in the week
ended Jan. 11, according to Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR
Global, which tracks money flows. It was the first inflow in
four weeks and the biggest since Nov. 23, said  Cameron Brandt ,
the director of research. Gold and precious-metals inflows
totaled $414 million, he said.  The  Federal Reserve  said Jan. 11 the economy improved in
December across most of the country. Inflation fell to a 15-
month low in  China , the world’s biggest consumer of everything
from zinc to copper to cotton, giving policymakers more leeway
in easing monetary policy to shore up growth.  “The mindset of the investor though is that no one wants
to miss a rally, so they’ve always got a toe in the water,”
said  Jon Fisher , a  fund manager  at Fifth Third Asset Management
in  Minneapolis , which oversees about $16 billion of assets. “It
doesn’t take much for them go get both feet in.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
