China  will consider relaxing
overseas listing rules to encourage smaller Chinese companies to
sell shares in Hong Kong, a top official at the nation’s
securities regulator said.  Standards to list so-called H shares are too high and the
approval process is time-consuming, Yao Gang, vice chairman of
The China Securities Regulatory Commission, said at a conference
in Hong Kong today. A relaxation will help private companies and
small-to-medium enterprises in China to sell stock, he said.  “Current H-share listing rules were set more than a decade
ago, and there haven’t been changes throughout these years,”
Yao said. “This year, the CSRC will conduct a comprehensive
revision on overseas listing rules,” Yao said.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  said on Dec. 20 that many enterprises
are suffering from higher credit costs, after gross domestic
product grew at the slowest pace since 2009 in the third quarter.
Six-month interbank borrowing rates in  Shanghai  have risen to
5.42 percent, up from 3.66 percent on Jan. 17 last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  First-time share sales by Chinese companies overseas raised
$15.3 billion last year, down 58 percent from 2010 and hitting a
three-year low, Bloomberg data show. There were 59 such deals
last year, compared with 124 in 2010, the data show.  In Hong Kong, first-time offerings by Chinese companies
raised $13.1 billion last year, a 59 percent decline from 2010,
according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
