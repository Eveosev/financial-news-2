Ryan Anderson scored a career-high
30 points, including seven three-pointers, as the  Orlando Magic 
rallied to beat the New York Knicks 102-93 today at Madison
Square Garden.  The Magic hit 17 three-point shots, tied for the most the
Knicks have ever allowed, and overcame a four-point fourth-
quarter deficit in the victory.  Carmelo Anthony  led all scorers
with 33 points, as the Knicks lost their third consecutive game.  Elsewhere in the  National Basketball Association  on the
Martin Luther King holiday it was the Memphis Grizzlies 102-86
over the Chicago Bulls, who played without last year’s Most
Valuable Player  Derrick Rose ; and Philadelphia 94, Milwaukee 82.  Anthony was 9-27 from the floor and added a team-high five
assists after missing the Knicks’ last game with a sprained
right ankle. The 27-year-old forward today was named one of 20
finalists for the 2012 U.S. Olympic Team. Knicks rookie guard
Iman Shumpert added 12 points.  Anderson has made 43 three-point shots this year, the most
in the NBA. Magic center  Dwight Howard , an All-Star in each of
the last five seasons, scored eight points and added 10
rebounds before fouling out with a minute remaining.  The Magic (9-3) have won four games in a row, and sit atop
the Eastern Conference Southeast division standings. The Knicks
(6-7) are second in the Atlantic Division, four games behind the
Philadelphia 76ers.  -- Editor: Michael Sillup  To contact the reporters on this story:
