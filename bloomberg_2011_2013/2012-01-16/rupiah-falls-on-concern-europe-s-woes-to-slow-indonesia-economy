Indonesia ’s rupiah fell, weakening
toward a seven-week low, on concern Europe’s credit crisis will
slow growth in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index retreated for a
second straight day after Standard & Poor’s cut France’s top
credit rating and downgraded eight other euro-zone nations last
week. The rupiah has lost 0.3 percent since Jan. 12, when  Bank
Indonesia  left its benchmark reference rate unchanged at 6
percent following a monetary-policy review.  “There is more  risk aversion  after the euro-zone
downgrades,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange
research at Malayan Banking Bhd. in Singapore. “Global factors
are hurting the overall sentiment.”  The rupiah slid 1.1 percent to 9,185 per dollar as of 3:15
p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg. The currency touched 9,218 earlier and reached
9,233 on Jan. 9, which was the weakest since Nov. 29.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, from the end
of last week to 6.13 percent today, according to the midday
prices by Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
