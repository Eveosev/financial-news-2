Foxconn Technology Group plans to
eliminate as many as 600 jobs at its Slovak liquid-crystal
display factory as demand has weakened,  Hospodarske Noviny 
reported, citing the regional Labor Office.  After the job cuts, Foxconnâ€™s plant in Nitra, western
Slovakia, will have 1,800 employees, the newspaper said. The
company bought the factory in 2010 from Sony Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
