Serbia  will seek a broad political
agreement with Kosovo while in talks on technical issues with
its former province as part of efforts to become a candidate for
European Union membership.  While it will refuse to recognize Kosovo’s 2008 secession,
Serbia wants a “sustainable and lasting peace” with Kosovo’s
ethnic Albanian majority, Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said
today in a speech outlining 2012 foreign policy goals. Serbia
needs “ironclad, internationally guaranteed assurances that
safeguard” the Serb population and their heritage in Kosovo,
including ancient Christian churches, as well as “settling
private and commercial property claims,” he said in Belgrade.  Serbia’s failure to make substantial progress in EU-
mediated talks with Kosovo over trade, border control and mutual
recognition of documents led to a delay in December on awarding
the country candidate status.  “Our diplomatic efforts will also focus on maintaining a
healthy international environment within which the technical
dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina can continue,” Jeremic
said.  Protests by an ethnic Albanian group that demands a
continued boycott of Serbian goods left 10  Kosovo  police
officers injured and 18 protesters arrested in the last several
days. In previous months, Serbs living in northern Kosovo led
rallies against the attempts by ethnic Albanians to control all
of the disputed territory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
