India ’s rupee rose, reversing
earlier losses, on speculation foreign funds will increase
purchases of the nation’s assets after inflation slowed to a
two-year low.  The benchmark  wholesale-price index  rose 7.47 percent in
December from a year earlier, after gaining 9.11 percent in
November. The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  of shares added 0.2
percent following the government report.  “The threat of higher inflation has been erased,” said J. Moses Harding, executive vice president at IndusInd Bank Ltd. in
Mumbai. “Indian stocks could now appear relatively cheap and
bonds still look very attractive, which will contribute to the
rupee’s stability.”  The rupee advanced 0.3 percent to 51.3950 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, after earlier
declining as much as 0.5 percent. Foreign funds boosted  holdings 
of Indian debt by $2.6 billion this month to a record $28.7
billion as on Jan. 12, while investments in stocks have
increased by $543.1 million.  Three-month offshore forwards traded at 52.57 a dollar,
compared with 52.55 on Jan. 13. Forwards are agreements to buy
or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
