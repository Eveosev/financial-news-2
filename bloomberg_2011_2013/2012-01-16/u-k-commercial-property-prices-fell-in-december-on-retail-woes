U.K. commercial-property prices fell
for the second month in December as demand for assets in all but
the best locations dropped amid concern that the country is
slipping back into recession.  The average value of stores, offices and warehouses
declined 0.1 percent in December from a year earlier,  Investment
Property Databank Ltd . said today on its website. Retail
properties led the decline, falling 0.2 percent.  Prices fell 0.02 percent in November after gaining 17.8
percent in the previous 27 months of continuous growth. Prices
dropped  44.2 percent  from their July 2007 peak to July 2009,
according to the London-based research company. U.K. commercial
real estate values may fall by 5.9 percent this year, JPMorgan
Chase & Co. said in a note to investors on Jan. 13.  “The outlook for 2012 is less than ideal,” Phil Tilly,
IPD’s managing director for the U.K. and Ireland, said in the
statement. “During the last three months of the year, as the
euro situation worsened and the threat of recession increased,
returns tailed off considerably.”  Office values in the City of  London  financial district
declined 0.1 percent in December, the first drop in 27 months.
They fell 50 percent from 2007 to 2009 before recovering 35
percent through November 2011, IPD said.  The total return, which combines the change in property
values and rental income, amounted to 8.1 percent in the 12
months through December, IPD said. The index was compiled from
appraisals of 3,595 properties valued at 33.6 billion pounds
($51.4 billion) at the end of December, IPD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
