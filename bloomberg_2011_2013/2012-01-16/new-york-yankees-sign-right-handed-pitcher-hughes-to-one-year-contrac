The  New York Yankees  signed right-
handed starting pitcher  Phil Hughes  to a one-year deal, the
Major League Baseball team said in an e-mailed statement.  The Yankees, who by reaching an agreement with the 25-year-
old Hughes avoided salary arbitration, didnâ€™t release details of
the contract yesterday. NBC Sports reported that the deal was
worth $3.2 million.  In 14 starts last season, Hughes was 5-5 with a 5.79 earned
run average, the highest among Yankees pitchers with more than
one start. He missed a portion of the season with inflammation
in his throwing shoulder.  An All-Star in 2010, Hughes is 36-23 with a 4.46 ERA in his
five-year career, spent entirely in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
