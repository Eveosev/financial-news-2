Six board members of the  Commercial
Bank of Kuwait SAK (CBK)  resigned today, acting Chief Executive
Officer Elham Mahfouz said.  “The board members resigned over how to implement the
bank’s strategy,” Mahfouz said in a phone interview today from
 Kuwait City , without providing more details on the strategy. The
board members will remain in their posts until elections are
held at the next  shareholders’ meeting , Mahfouz said.  Commercial Bank posted a 65 percent drop in third-quarter
profit last year to 6.8 million dinars ($24.3 million),
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank has been
embroiled in a legal dispute with  Investment Dar Co. (TID)  over the
ownership of shares in  Boubyan Bank KSC (BOUBYAN) , an Islamic lender
controlled by National Bank of Kuwait SAK.  Commercial Bank said in May 2009 it owned 19.2 percent of
Boubyan Bank.  Investment Dar (TID) , the owner of half of carmaker
Aston Martin, lost a buyback option on the stake, which it sold
for 94.1 million dinars in December 2008. Commercial Bank
subsequently agreed to sell its stake in Boubyan Bank to
 National Bank of Kuwait  for about 121 million dinars.  Investment Dar said in June 2009 it filed three lawsuits
against Commercial Bank demanding the return of the shares.  Commercial Bank shares lost 2.5 percent this year after
declining 14 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
