UBS AG (UBS) , Switzerland’s biggest bank,
named Chris Niehaus, head of its investment banking operations
in the Middle East, chief operating officer of the investment
banking department in Europe, Middle East and Africa.  Niehaus, who will be based in  London , replaces Andrew
Schaeffer, according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg
News. He will also become head of the Business Office,

will continue to work with some clients that region. Tony Iliya,
head of UBS’s operations in the  Middle East , will assume
