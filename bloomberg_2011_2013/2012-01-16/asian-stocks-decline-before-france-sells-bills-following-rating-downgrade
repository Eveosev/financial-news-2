Asian  stocks  fell ahead of a debt
sale today by France after  Standard & Poor’s  stripped the
country of its top credit rating and cut eight other European
nations on concern the region hasn’t done enough to contain its
debt crisis.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. ,  Australia ’s
third-largest lender by market value, slid 1.6 percent amid
concern Europe’s crisis will hurt the global financial system.
 Sony Corp. (6758) , which gets 21 percent of its revenue in Europe, lost
2.3 percent. Guangzhou R&F Properties Company Ltd., a Chinese
developer, fell 2.8 percent ahead of a report tomorrow forecast
to show  China ’s economy grew the least in 10 quarters.  BYD Co. (1211) ,
a Chinese carmaker partially owned by billionaire Warren
Buffett, rose 4.8 percent after a newspaper reported China will
grant tax exemptions to some electric passenger cars.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1.1 percent, the most
since Dec. 19, to 115.6 as of 8:36 p.m. in  Tokyo  after talks
between Greek officials and creditors stalled last week, raising
the threat of default. About four stocks fell for each that rose
in the measure. and all 10 industry groups declined. The measure
added 2.2 percent last week.  “It’s unrealistic to expect  Europe  to make progress in
dealing with debt issues in a straight line without having
hiccups,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage about $1 billion
at Platypus Asset Management Ltd. in Sydney. S&P’s ratings
downgrades are “not going to help investor sentiment.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slid 0.1 percent
today. The index lost 0.5 percent in  New York  on Jan. 13. After
the market closed, S&P said it downgraded France, while  Germany 
had its credit rating affirmed.  S&P Downgrades  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 1.4 percent even
after a report showed the nation’s machine orders in November
surged the most since January 2008.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slid 1.2 percent, while South
Korea’s Kospi Index lost 0.9 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng
Index fell 1 percent.  Taiwan’s Taiex Index (TWSE)  retreated 1.1 percent
even after Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou, a booster of closer
ties with China, was re-elected.  Germany, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg and
the Netherlands had their ratings affirmed by S&P as France lost
its AAA rating. France was cut to AA+ with a negative outlook,
S&P said in a statement. Cyprus, Italy, Portugal and Spain were
cut two grades, S&P said. The long-term ratings on Austria,
Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia were also cut.  Banks, Exporters Fall  Financial companies contributed the most to the decline in
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index before France sells as much as 8.7
billion euros ($11 billion) of bills today, followed by Spain’s
and  Greece ’s bill sales tomorrow. Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group lost 1.6 percent to A$20.86.  Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender, fell 2.7 percent
to 325 yen.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s biggest lender, lost 0.8
percent to HK$59.65.  Exporters to Europe dropped after the euro touched 97.04
yen today, the lowest price since November 2000. A weaker euro
erodes the value of Asian exporters’ sales to the region. Sony
slid 2.3 percent to 1,297 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a Japanese camera
maker that generates about a third of its sales in Europe,
declined 2.2 percent to 3,280 yen.  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , an
operator of retail chains and ports that gets 53 percent of its
 revenue  in Europe, slid 1.5 percent to HK$67.25.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 2.7 percent this year
through Jan. 13, compared with a 2.5 percent gain by the  S&P 500 
and a 1.9 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.3 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.3 times for the S&P 500
and 10 times for the Stoxx 600.  China Stocks  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, dropped 1.7 percent. Gross domestic
product, the value of all goods and services produced in the
economy, probably rose 8.7 percent from a year earlier, the
slowest pace since the second quarter of 2009, according to the
 median forecast  of 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The data, plus indicators for investment, retail sales and
industrial production, will be released tomorrow in Beijing.  “Private sectors, especially the property sector, have
caused a slowdown, which they seem to be happy about,” Patkar
at Platypus Asset Management said, referring to policy makers in
Beijing. “They have the ability and willingness to support
growth in 2012, so I see it as less of a concern from an
investor sentiment point of view.”  Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. fell 2.8 percent to HK$6.70.
 Country Garden Holdings Co. (2007) , a real estate developer, slid 5.2
percent to HK$3.13 in Hong Kong.  Electric Cars  BYD Co. gained 4.8 percent to HK$21.80 after rising as much
as 6.7 percent. China announced the first batch of electric
passenger cars that will be exempt from vehicle and vessel
taxes, People’s Daily reported, citing a government statement.
BYD was the worst performer last year on the  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies listed in Hong Kong,
falling 59 percent.  China Southern Airlines Co. (1055) , the No. 1 carrier by
passengers, fell 8.6 percent to HK$3.95 after Citigroup Inc. cut
