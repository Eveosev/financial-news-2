BAE Systems Plc (BA/) ,  Europe ’s largest
defense company, hired LEK Consulting LLP to conduct a review of
its shipbuilding division, a person with knowledge of the
situation said.  LEK will mainly provide modeling and analytical advice to
the London-based weapons maker, said the person, who declined to
be identified because details of the contract are private.  BAE is looking to sustain its 6,000-strong shipbuilding
workforce before contracts for aircraft carriers and Type 45
destroyers dry up, and as it waits for a U.K. frigate contract
to start. The company signed a 15-year, low-cost shipbuilding
agreement with the U.K. government in 2009, getting vessel
orders in return for ensuring Britain’s warship capability.  The British manufacturer is seeking export orders to ensure
the commercial viability of its Global Combat Ship program,
including a Type 26 frigate that could be in production until
2030. LEK provides strategic advice to manufacturers in
industries from energy to aerspace.  The U.K.’s Independent newspaper earlier reported BAE had
taken on LEK as a consultant and that Glasgow and Portsmouth
yards may face closure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
