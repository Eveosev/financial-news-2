PetroChina Co. (857)  and  China Petroleum
and Chemical Corp. (386) , the country’s biggest oil producers, fell in
Hong Kong trading after crude dropped to the lowest in almost
four weeks on concerns Europe’s debt crisis may curb demand.  PetroChina declined as much as 2.2 percent, the most since
Dec. 15, and was at HK$10.78 at 10:22 a.m. local time, down 1.8
percent. Sinopec, as China Petroleum is known, dropped 1.4
percent to HK$8.81, while  Cnooc (883)  Ltd. retreated 1.2 percent. The
benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 1 percent.  Crude slid to $98.70 a barrel in New York on Jan. 13, the
lowest close since Dec. 21, after Standard & Poor’s stripped
France of its top credit rating and cut eight other euro-zone
nations, prompting concerns energy demand may slow. The  MSCI
Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  sank 1.3 percent in Tokyo following a 2.2
percent gain last week.  “The overall market atmosphere turned negative after those
European countries lost their top credit rating,” Shi Yan, a
Shanghai-based analyst at UOB-Kay Hian Ltd., said by telephone.
Sinopec may lead a rebound in oil shares when the market
stabilizes, she said.  Sinopec has gained 14 percent in Hong Kong trading in the
past year, while PetroChina has climbed 1.7 percent. Cnooc, the
country’s largest offshore oil explorer, has declined 22 percent.  The unit of China Petrochemical Corp. signed an agreement
with Saudi Arabian Oil Co. Jan. 14 to develop a refinery in
Saudi Arabia, and the companies are in talks to build another in
China, their second in the country.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. and Sinopec signed a
memorandum of understanding for the construction of a
petrochemical plant in Tianjin, the official Saudi Arabia Press
Agency reported Jan. 15.  Crude for February delivery was at $98.81 a barrel, up 0.1
percent, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange at 10:21 a.m.  Hong Kong  time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
