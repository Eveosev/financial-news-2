Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , China’s biggest Internet
company by market value, said it will set up a new center for
international operations in southern China, stepping up efforts
to add overseas users and revenue.  International expansion is an “important way” for Baidu
to drive future growth, Chief Executive Officer Robin Li said
today in Shenzhen, where the company is building a 220,000
square-meter complex to be opened in 2015. The facility will
also accommodate the mobile Internet business, he said.  Baidu started services in Arabic and Thai last year as the
Beijing-based company boosted plans to expand internationally
after overcoming competition from  Google Inc. (GOOG)  to dominate in
China’s search-engine market. Chinese Internet rivals  Tencent
Holdings Ltd. (700)  and  Alibaba.com Ltd. (1688N)  have also acquired online
assets overseas.  The new Shenzhen office complex will be able to house
10,000 employees, Baidu spokesman Kaiser Kuo said by phone
today. Baidu at present has about 15,000 employees, he said.  In May, Baidu said it’s working on services in 12 foreign
languages. The Chinese company, which started a Japanese service
in 2008, rolled out products in Arabic and Thai in September.  Robin Li’s wealth increased to $9.2 billion from $7.2
billion a year earlier, ranking him behind only Sany Heavy
Industry Co. Chairman Liang Wengen among China’s richest,
according to Forbes Asia.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
