Serbia  wants a U.N.-mandated
investigation into the alleged murder of ethnic-Serb captives by
organ traffickers during the Kosovo conflict, Foreign Minister
Vuk Jeremic said.  The Balkan nation has faced resistance in its efforts to
investigate killings described in a report by the 47-nation
 Council of Europe , Jeremic said at a conference in Belgrade
today, without specifying the obstacles. Only the  United Nations
Security Council  can give “a universal mandate” and adequate
jurisdiction for a full probe, he said.  “Fostering international support for a genuinely impartial
and transparent criminal investigation into allegations of the
harvesting and smuggling of human organs” in the 1998-1999 war
is among Serbia’s foreign policy priorities, Jeremic said.  Several dozen Serbs were allegedly murdered for their
organs that were sold on the international black market,
according to the report that also implicated Kosovo’s Prime
Minister Hashim Thaci, a guerilla leader at the time of the
conflict. Thaci has refuted the allegations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
