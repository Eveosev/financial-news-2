OGX Petroleo (OGXP3)  & Gas Participacoes SA,
the oil company controlled by Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista, rose the most in three weeks after announcing an
offshore discovery just days before starting production for the
first time.  OGX rose 5.4 percent to 14.92 reais at 4:40 p.m. in  Sao
Paulo , the biggest gain since Dec. 20. OGX led gainers on
 Brazil ’s Bovespa Index.  The Fortaleza well contains the thickest reservoir OGX has
found to date in the  Santos Basin , according to data on the
company’s website. OGX operates five exploration licenses in the
Santos Basin, where the company has 1.8 billion barrels of
potential oil and natural-gas resources.  “This opens up a new exploration frontier, its a new play
in the basin,” Ricardo Correa, an analyst at brokerage Ativa
SA, said in a telephone interview from  Rio de Janeiro . “The
market took the news well.”  OGX, based in Rio, found hydrocarbons in two separate
sections of the Fortaleza well in the BM-S-57 block, the company
said in a regulatory filing today. OGX has primarily discovered
natural gas and condensates in the area since it started
drilling in 2010.  OGX is preparing to start producing oil in the Campos Basin
after moving its first production platform to the area last
week. The progress on producing oil after months of delays in
2011 contributed to today’s gains, Correa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
