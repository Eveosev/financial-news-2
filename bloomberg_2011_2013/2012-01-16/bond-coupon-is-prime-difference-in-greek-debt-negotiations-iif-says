Greek debt swap talks between
bondholders and government officials broke down last week
because of disagreements over the coupon on the new bonds, said
 Frank Vogl , a spokesman at the Institute of International
Finance.  Negotiations were also put on hold because there was no
agreement from the different authorities involved, Vogl said
today in an e-mail. The IIF is representing bondholders in talks
with officials from the  International Monetary Fund , the
European Union and the Greek government.  “A prime difference relates to the  interest rate  to be paid
on new Greek bonds,” the spokesman said. The IIF is “hopeful”
that Charles Dallara, the group’s managing director, can return
to Athens in coming days, he said.  Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said two days
ago that talks with the IIF will resume on Jan. 18. The
Washington-based IIF, which represents banks holding the bonds,
said on Jan. 14 there is a “tentative plan” to return to  Athens 
mid-week. The two sides broke off negotiations on Jan. 13.  “There have been differences of views among the official
parties to the negotiations, despite the best efforts of the
Greek government’s leadership,” Vogl said. It’s important that
the talks conclude “as soon as possible,” he said.  The coupon is the interest rate paid on a bond.  To contact the reporters on this story:
