Greek natural-gas supplier  Depa  has
conducted a preliminary study into building an underwater
pipeline between Cyprus and Greece, Environment and Energy
Minister  George Papaconstantinou  said.  The pipeline, which would carry natural gas from the
eastern Mediterranean, would run from Cyprus to the southern
Greek Peloponnese region via the island of Crete and is
“entirely feasible” from a technical aspect, Papaconstantinou
told a Cypriot newspaper, according to an e-mailed transcript of
his comments sent late yesterday from his Athens-based  Ministry .  The project’s economic viability must be investigated, and
Depa is also looking at building a liquefied natural-gas
terminal as a possible alternative, Papaconstantinou said. As
well as being destined for export markets, Greece has a growing
demand for natural gas, he said.  Both Cyprus and  Israel  have discovered natural-gas reserves
in their exclusive economic zones.  Greece  will start the process
to sell Depa and its fully owned gas grid operator Desfa SA by
the end of this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
