Finnprotein Oy , a soy processing
company in Finland, has obtained a 65 million-euro ($82 million)
project finance facility.  The seven-year credit line will be used to build a multi-
stage soy processing plant in Uusikaupunki, Finland, the largest
of its type in Europe, according to a statement from lenders.  Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  and  Pohjola Bank Plc (POH1S)  acted as mandated lead
arrangers. Finnvera OYJ is also involved in the deal “with a
significant stake,” the lender said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
