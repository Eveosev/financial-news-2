South Korea’s won retreated and
 government bonds  gained as  Standard & Poor’s  stripped France of
its top  credit rating  and cut eight other euro-zone nations,
sapping demand for riskier assets.  The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  of shares declined 0.9 percent after France
and Austria were cut one level to AA+ from AAA by S&P on Jan.
13. Spain and Italy were also among the nine nations downgraded.
The Bank of Korea kept  borrowing costs  unchanged at 3.25 percent
for a seventh month on Jan. 13, citing bigger downside risks for
the global economy.  “The won fell following rate cuts in Europe, but declines
were limited as the news was already expected and the stock
market reaction was not big,” said Lee Jung Ha, a Seoul-based
currency trader at Korea Development Bank. “Importers were
demanding the dollar to settle bills, which also put downward
pressure on the currency.”  The won fell 0.6 percent to 1,154.85 per dollar in Seoul,
after strengthening 1.3 percent last week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched a one-week high of 1,147.68 on
Jan. 13. Local financial markets will be closed on Jan. 23 and
Jan. 24 for a holiday.  The yield on  South Korea ’s 3.5 percent bonds due September
2016 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.48
percent, according to Korea Exchange Inc. prices. That’s the
lowest rate since Jan. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
