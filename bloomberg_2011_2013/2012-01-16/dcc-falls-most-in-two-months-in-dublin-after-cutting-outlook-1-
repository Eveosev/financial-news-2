DCC Plc (DCC)  fell the most in more than
two months in Dublin trading after cutting its full-year
operating profit forecast, as unseasonably warm weather hampered
demand for fuel.  DCC declined as much as 6.8 percent and traded 3.6 percent
or 67 euros cents lower at 17.73 euros in Dublin at 10:50 a.m.
after saying it expected operating profit of between 175 million
euros ($222 million) to 190 million euros. That compared with
earlier guidance for about 212 million euros.  “This is much lower than our downgraded forecasts,” Conor Harnett, an analyst at Dublin-based securities firm NCB
Stockbrokers, who has a buy rating on the company, said in a
note today.  While DCC has expanded by buying fuel distributors in
Ireland and the U.K., “exceptionally mild” Northern Europe
conditions hurt demand, the company said in today’s statement.
The average monthly temperature in the U.K., DCC’s largest
energy market, for the quarter to Dec. 31, was the warmest on
record, the company said.  “Temperatures have so far remained seasonally mild,”
since the end of the year, DCC said. “The absence of any
sustained cold weather along with the difficult economic
background and high  oil prices  are likely to continue to impact
adversely both volumes and margins for energy products.”  DCC said it said anticipates a return to growth in the
years through March 2013, without giving details. NCB expects
DCC’s operating profit for the year to March 31 to be 184
million euros and 226 million euros in fiscal 2013.  Brent Crude  Volumes at DCC Energy fell 12 percent in the quarter
compared with the same period in the previous year, DCC said.
Heating-related volumes fell 22 percent, as the average price of
Brent crude was 27 percent higher, DCC said.  Crude for February delivery rose as much as 78 cents to
$99.48 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  and was at $99.44 at 9:19 a.m. London time  DCC has fallen 23 percent in the past 12 months and 2.9
percent this year, giving the company a market value of 1.5
billion euros. The company plans to release its earnings for the
year through March 2012 on May 15.  “Much of the downgrade for the current fiscal year was
expected given the mild winter weather,” Caren Crowley at Davy,
who has an outperform rating on the company, said in a note.
“The earnings’ impact is bad luck rather than poor management.
The more cautious outlook for full-year 2013 is a reminder that
DCC is not immune to economic cycles.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
