European Union nations will sell 124
million metric tons of surplus carbon allowances originally set
aside for new entrants during the next 15 months, Tschach
Solutions GmbH estimated.  Of a total surplus of 220 million tons in the five years
through 2012, 124 million will be sold, 20 million will go to
new entrants and the remaining 76 million tons will be canceled,
Tschach Solutions in Karlsruhe,  Germany , predicted in a Jan. 12
report e-mailed today.  Germany and the U.K. may be forced to cancel at least some
of their new-entrant allowances because of rules that limit
sales to 10 percent of a nation’s cap in the five years, Ingo Tschach, managing director, said today by phone. Tschach
Solutions, which sells analysis on carbon and energy markets,
estimated Germany will probably be required to make 55 million
tons of the cancellations, while the U.K., which is already
selling from its reserve, may need to cancel 4 million.  The  European Investment Bank , which is selling at least 200
million 2013 carbon allowances on behalf of the EU through Oct.
2 from a regional new-entrant reserve, offloaded its first 12
million last month. EU carbon permits for December this year
dropped to a record 6.38 euros ($8.08) a metric ton on Jan. 4
because of surging supply and as demand is reduced by the euro
area’s sovereign-debt crisis.  They fell 3.9 percent today to 6.72 euros a ton on ICE
Futures  Europe  in  London  as of 10:50 a.m. local time.  In Germany, “new coal-power stations are severely delayed
and this reduces demand for new-entrant reserves
significantly,” Tschach said today in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
