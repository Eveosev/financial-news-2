The Canadian dollar strengthened to
its highest point in more than two weeks before a jobs report
expected to show the Canadian economy added positions for the
first time in three months in August.  The currency rose against the majority of its most traded
peers ahead of a report expected to show jobs were also created
in the U.S.,  Canada ’s largest trading partner. Canada created
20,000 jobs in August after shedding 39,400 positions the
previous month, according to the median estimate of a Bloomberg
survey of 22 economists. The  unemployment rate  was unchanged in
August at 7.2 percent, a separate survey showed.  “The labor market is expected to bounce back fairly
sharply after the decline we saw in the previous month,” said
 David Tulk , chief macro strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, by
phone from Toronto. “We think it’s going to be a little bit
more of a subdued bounce back to be honest, but that is how the
market is positioned.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, rose 0.6 percent to C$1.0446
per  U.S. dollar  at 7:50 a.m. in Toronto, the highest since Aug.
21. One loonie buys 95.71 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
