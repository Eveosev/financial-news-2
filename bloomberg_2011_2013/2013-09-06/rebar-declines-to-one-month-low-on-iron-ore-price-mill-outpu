Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai fell to the lowest in a month as a drop in  iron ore 
prices and rising output from mills encouraged selling.  Rebar for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
fell as much as 0.6 percent to 3,711 yuan ($606) a metric ton,
the lowest level for a most-active contract since Aug. 7.
Futures traded at 3,722 yuan at 10:46 a.m. local time and have
declined 0.8 percent this week.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port fell 0.7
percent yesterday to $137.10 a dry ton, the lowest price since
Aug. 7, according to a  price index  compiled by The Steel Index
Ltd. Chinese steel mills’ daily crude steel output reached an
average 2.1 million tons in the first 20 days of August,
compared with 1.9 million tons at the end of 2012, according to
China Iron and Steel Association.  “The steel mills’ output remained at a high level, which
will slow the destocking process in the market,” said Wu Zhili,
an analyst at Shenhua Futures Co. in Shenzhen. “Rebar prices
are under pressure from both high output and lower raw material
prices.”  The average  spot price  of rebar was little changed
yesterday at 3,603  yuan  a ton, according to Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
