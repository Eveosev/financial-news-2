Arsenic levels in rice and rice
products aren’t high enough to pose a short-term public health
risk, the U.S. government said.  Levels of inorganic arsenic in more than 1,300 samples
tested were too low to cause immediate health damage, the  Food
and Drug Administration   said  on its website today. The analysis
will be the crux of future study about the potential dangers of
arsenic in rice and related products, the agency said.  Rice is particularly vulnerable to absorbing arsenic, a
chemical element, because it’s grown in water. Rice and rice-based products such as cereal and baby foods were selected from
retailers and analyzed. The study occurred after consumer
advocacy groups raised concern that arsenic in rice threatened
the health of consumers.  The FDA said it will continue its investigation, including
looking into the potential for long-term health risks.  “These are the next steps,” Suzanne C. Fitzpatrick, the
senior adviser for toxicology at the FDA’s Center for Food
Safety and Applied Nutrition, said in a statement. “To look at
exposure levels, to analyze the risk, and determine how to
minimize that risk for the overall safety of consumers,
including vulnerable groups like children and pregnant women.”  Arsenic contamination can occur naturally from sources such
as eroding rocks or volcanic eruptions. The chemical element can
also be introduced into groundwater and soil by humans through
mining and the use of pesticides.  To contact the reporter on this story:
