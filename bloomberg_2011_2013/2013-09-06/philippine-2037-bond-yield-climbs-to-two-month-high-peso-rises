Philippine  government bonds  due 2037
fell, pushing the yield to a two-month high, before U.S. data
that may support the case for the  Federal Reserve  to reduce
stimulus. The peso strengthened.  The Labor Department may say today that payrolls in the
world’s largest economy rose by 180,000 in August, after a gain
of 162,000 in July, while the jobless rate held at 7.4 percent,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The
 Federal Open Market Committee  will meet on Sept. 17-18 to
discuss its debt-purchase program. The 10-year U.S. Treasury
yield climbed to 3 percent for the first time in two years.  “The market will remain cautious until the Fed meeting,
trading will remain thin and very focused on what’s happening
externally,” said Joric Nazario, treasurer at Philippine
Veterans Bank in  Manila . “Flush liquidity, manageable inflation
and strong growth will continue to work in the  Philippines ’
favor. Investors will probably resume taking notice once the Fed
issue is out of the way.”  The  yield  on the 6.125 percent bonds due October 2037 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.52 percent, the
highest since July 10, according to midday fixing prices at
Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp. The rate increased six basis
points this week.  The peso gained 0.2 percent to 44.48 per dollar at the
close in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency
rose 0.3 percent this week. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected exchange-rate moves used to price options,
added six basis points today to 6.98 percent.  ‘Tool Kit’  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will keep its benchmark
 overnight rate  unchanged at 3.5 percent on Sept. 12, according
to all 10 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Consumer prices rose
2.1 percent in August, the slowest pace in four years, the
government said yesterday.  The central bank “has room in its policy tool kit to
mitigate potential adverse effects” from the geopolitical
issues in the  Middle East  and their impact on prices, Governor
Amando Tetangco said yesterday. Bangko Sentral targets average
inflation of between 3 percent and 5 percent this year and next.  “If inflation was the only factor, then BSP clearly has
room for easing but there are so many concerns globally that
probably merit a no-change decision next week,” Nazario said.  The Fed will probably reduce its $85 billion monthly bond
purchases in its September meeting, according to 65 percent of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg Aug. 9-13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
