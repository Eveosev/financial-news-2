Novartis AG (NOVN)  entered a collaboration
with Regenerex LLC, gaining access to stem cell technology that
may help kidney  transplant  patients avoid taking anti-rejection
medicine for life.  Regenerex, a startup biology company based in Louisville,
Kentucky, and Novartis have entered an exclusive global
licensing deal and will work together on research, the Basel,
Switzerland-based company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Regenerex’s technology allowed five of eight kidney
transplant patients to stop taking about a dozen pills a day to
suppress their immune systems, according to research published
last year. The pills, which prevent rejection and stop tissue
from a donated kidney from attacking the patient, can damage the
transplant and cause diabetes, infections,  heart disease  and
cancer.  “With the global licensing agreement with Regenerex,
Novartis gains access to stem cell technology, which can be used
in the areas of cancer and transplantation,”  Andrew Weiss , an
analyst with Bank Vontobel AG in Zurich, said in a note to
clients today. “Novartis gains further expertise in this
area.”  The technology may also be used in a number of inherited
metabolic diseases with high unmet need such as  sickle cell
disease  or  metachromatic leukodystrophy .  Last year, Novartis agreed to fund a $20 million research
center at the  University of Pennsylvania  in a deal to gain
technology that uses manipulated immune-system cells to fight
cancer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
