Crude oil calls rose as underlying
futures climbed to a two-year high amid falling supplies at a
key U.S. hub and rising tensions between the U.S. and  Russia 
over a potential American strike against  Syria .  Implied volatility of calls protecting against a 10 percent
increase in October futures prices on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose to 32.76 percent at 4:35 p.m. from 31.64 percent
yesterday.  “They’re hedging against the worst-case scenario against a
possible disruption of supply,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market
analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “Call buying
accelerated as these tensions don’t seem to be going away.”  West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery gained
$2.16 to $110.53 a barrel on the Nymex, the highest settlement
since May 3, 2011.  Crude rose as Russian President  Vladimir Putin  said he will
continue supporting Syria if the U.S. launches a strike,
increasing concern that escalating tension will disrupt Middle
East oil exports. Supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for the Nymex contract, are the lowest since February
2012.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
October $115 calls, which rose 20 cents to 54 cents a barrel
with 2,980 lots trading as of 4:44 p.m. November $95 puts were
the second-most active, falling 7 cents to 34 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,742 contracts.  “On the put side, if history is any guide, usually any
actions cause a quick sharp rally and then a reversal,” Flynn
said.  October Volatility  At-the-money volatility for October options, a measure of
expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, slipped to
24.8 percent from 25.39 percent yesterday. Volatility for puts
covering a 10 percent drop rose to 29.8 percent from 29.58
percent.  Inventories at Cushing fell 1.83 million barrels last week
to 34.8 million, Energy Information Administration data show.  “At least some segment of the trading community is
focusing on Cushing inventories for moving the WTI price
higher,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures
Perspective in  New York .  Puts accounted for 54 percent of electronic trading volume
today. In the previous session, calls made up 56 percent of the
99,427 lots traded.  December 2015 $120 calls were the most-active options
yesterday with 6,000 contracts changing hands as they gained 3
cents to $1.12 a barrel. November $140 calls, the next-most
active, rose 1 cents to 12 cents on 3,997 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts, with
40,925 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 37,181 lots
and December $105 calls with 34,816.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
