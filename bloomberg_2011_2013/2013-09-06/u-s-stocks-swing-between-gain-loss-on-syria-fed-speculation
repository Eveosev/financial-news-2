U.S. stocks swung between gains and
losses as investors weighed tensions between America and Russia
over  Syria  and slower-than-forecast jobs growth that eased
concern about reductions in Federal Reserve stimulus.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index was little changed at
1,656.15 at 10:48 a.m. in New York after climbing as much as 0.4
percent and retreating as much as 0.9 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
