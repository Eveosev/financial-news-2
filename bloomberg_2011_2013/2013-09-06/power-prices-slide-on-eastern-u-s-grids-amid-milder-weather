Spot wholesale electricity declined
on grids in the eastern U.S. as milder weather reduced demand
for air conditioning.  Power consumption in  New York City  headed for a 12-week low
while demand dropped in New England and the Midwest. Prices on
the 13-state network operated by PJM Interconnection LLC slid
for a fourth straight day along with electricity use.  Temperatures will be mostly below normal from New England
through the Midwest and mid-Atlantic states until Sept. 10,
according to WSI Corp. in Andover,  Massachusetts . The high in
Manhattan today may be 73 degrees Fahrenheit (23 Celsius) and
 Washington  may be 77, 6 below normal for both cities, said
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  “We’ve got some weather that’s coming in that’s
alleviating some of the cooling load,” said Michael Harris,
chief executive officer of Unified Energy Services LLC, the
Houston-based retail energy consulting unit of brokerage Tullett
Prebon Group Ltd.  Spot prices for  New York  fell $12.34, or 29 percent, to
average $30.95 a megawatt-hour as of 1 p.m. from the same time
yesterday, grid data compiled by Bloomberg show. Boston fell
$11.77, or 28 percent, to $30.51.  The premium for New York City on-peak prices narrowed to 75
cents versus Boston from $2.66 yesterday.  The New York Independent System Operator Inc. expected
 demand  in Manhattan and its four neighboring boroughs to climb
today to 6,899 megawatts, the lowest hourly peak for a weekday
since June 14, grid data show.  Power use  on the PJM system, which serves more than 60
million people, including residents of Washington, Philadelphia
and Chicago, will peak at 101,982 megawatts, the least for any
weekday since Aug. 16, PJM data show.  Spot electricity at PJM’s benchmark Western hub, which
includes deliveries to Washington, slid $2.99, or 7.6 percent,
to $36.43 a megawatt-hour as of 1 p.m.  Prices were also lower at southern and western power hubs
serving  Los Angeles ,  San Francisco , Houston and Dallas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
