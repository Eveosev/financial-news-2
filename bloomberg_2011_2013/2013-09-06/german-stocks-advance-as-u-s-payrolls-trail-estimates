German stocks advanced, erasing an
earlier decline, as investors weighed whether the Federal
Reserve will reduce bond purchases after data showed U.S.
payrolls in August missed economistsâ€™ estimates.  The benchmark DAX Index climbed 0.3 percent to 8,260.69 at
2:34 p.m. in  Frankfurt , erasing an earlier drop of as much as
0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
