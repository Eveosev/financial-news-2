MGM Resorts International (MGM)  was
ordered to rehire a condominium sales employee and pay about
$325,000 in damages under whistle-blower provisions of the
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act .  The employee worked at  The Signature at MGM Grand , a
condominium and hotel complex on the  Las Vegas Strip , according
to a statement yesterday from the U.S. Department of Labor’s
 Occupational Safety and Health Administration .  The worker was terminated for disclosing that colleagues
were allegedly violating Securities and Exchange Commission
rules by providing revenue and occupancy estimates to potential
condominium buyers, while they were not licensed to do so, OSHA
said. If a condo is offered for sale with an emphasis on its
economic benefit from rent, it is deemed a security and such
properties require licensed securities brokers to sell them, the
agency said.  “This employee tried to ensure the employer was following
the law and paid a hefty price for speaking up,” Ken Atha,
OSHA’s regional administrator in San Francisco said in the
statement.  OSHA enforces the whistle-blower provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley. The department does not release employee names in
whistle-blower complaints.  “We view this preliminary finding as fundamentally wrong
on the facts and the law of this matter,” Las Vegas-based MGM
Resorts said in an e-mailed statement. “We intend to pursue
avenues for further review.”  OSHA’s order to rehire the employee was earlier reported by
the  Associated Press .  To contact the reporter on this story:
