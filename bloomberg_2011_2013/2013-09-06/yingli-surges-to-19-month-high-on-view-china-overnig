Chinese stocks traded in New York
posted the biggest weekly gain in eight months, led by real
estate companies and solar makers, amid signs the economy is
strengthening after two quarters of slowing growth.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity  Index (HSCEI)  of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. added 4.7 percent to 99.53, the most
since the week ended Jan. 4. The gauge, which entered a  bull
market  Sept. 4, has risen 22 percent from its June low. Real-estate brokerage  E-House China Holdings Ltd. (EJ)  soared 43 percent,
its biggest increase on record, while property website  SouFun
Holdings Ltd. (SFUN)  surged 19 percent. Solar-panel maker  Yingli Green
Energy Holding Co. (YGE)  advanced 30 percent to a 19-month high.  China’s home prices rose in August by the most since
December, data from SouFun showed last week. The official
 Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose more than estimated to a 16-month high, the government said on Sept. 1. Margins improved for
solar energy producers in the second quarter, a Bloomberg
Industries report showed Sept. 5. Since June 24, the Bloomberg
China-US gauge has outperformed the 3.9 percent gain in  India ’s
S&P BSE Sensex and the 17 percent jump in  Brazil ’s Ibovespa.  “In the past, the government talked about curbing
prices,” Michael Ding, lead manager of the  China Region Fund (USCOX)  at
the U.S. Global Investors Inc., which oversees $2.2 billion,
said by phone from  San Antonio ,  Texas  on Sept. 6. “The new
leadership, since they took over, never really talked about
curbing the real estate market. They’ve been more inclined to
use the market mechanisms instead of using government control.
That’s very positive.”  ETF Rallies  The iShares China Large-Cap  ETF (FXI) , the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., rallied 6.4 percent, the
biggest weekly advance since December 2011. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index added 1.4 percent for the week.  E-House’s American depositary receipts surged 11 percent to
$8.69 on Sept. 6, the highest level since October 2011. Trading
volume was more than six times daily average over the past three
months, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  SouFun, owner of  China ’s biggest real estate information
website, ended at $49.53 on Sept. 6, completing its third week
of gains.  Baoding, China-based Yingli advanced 1.5 percent to $5.59
on Sept. 6, the highest since Feb. 9. 2012. Trading volume on
the ADR, the most active on the Bloomberg China-US gauge, was
twice the three-month average.  Suntech added 2.7 percent to a two-week high of $1.15,
after surging 12 percent on Sept. 5.  “The solar companies are basically supported by Chinese
government policy,” said Ding. “The outlook for the U.S.
market is also better than two years ago, and that provides more
opportunities.”  Growing Fleet  China Southern Airlines Co., the biggest Asian carrier by
traffic, surged 11 percent last week, the most since January, to
$18.91, while China Eastern Airlines Corp., the nation’s third-biggest carrier by sales, jumped 6.5 percent to $16.09.  China will need 5,580 new planes costing $780 billion
through 2032, Chicago-based Boeing said in a statement
distributed at a briefing in Beijing. Boeing said last year that
China would need 5,260 new planes worth $670 billion through
2031. The planemaker said that the size of China’s airplane
fleet will triple over the next two decades as traffic in the
country grows by almost 7 percent a year.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index was little changed at
10,334.07, ending the week with a 5.2 percent jump, while the
Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.8 percent to 2,139.99 for a 2
percent gain on the week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
