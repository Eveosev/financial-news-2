Shane Victorino  had a run-scoring
single in the 10th inning to give the Boston Red Sox a 9-8
victory at the New York Yankees after closer  Mariano Rivera  blew
his sixth save of the Major League Baseball season.  The Red Sox (85-57), who lead the American League East, are
nine games ahead of the third-place Yankees (75-65). The
Baltimore Orioles (74-65), who beat the Chicago White Sox 3-1
last night, are one-half game behind New York in fourth place.  The Red Sox, who took the first game of a four-game series,
will meet the Yankees six more times over 10 days as the regular
season nears its end on Sept. 29.  The Yankees, trailing 7-2 in the bottom of the seventh,
started a six-run inning with  Brett Gardner ’s run-scoring single
at Yankee Stadium.  Robinson Cano , Alfonso Soriano and  Curtis Granderson  drove in runs before Lyle Overbay’s two-run single
gave New York an 8-7 lead.  Stephen Drew tied the game 8-8 in the ninth inning as
Rivera allowed one run on two hits to blow his sixth save in 47
opportunities, his most since 2003.  Victorino, who drove in three runs including a solo homer
in the fifth inning, hit his winning single off Joba Chamberlain
(2-1), who gave up two hits in 2/3 innings before he was ejected
for arguing balls and strikes. Boone Logan closed out the 10th.  Craig Breslow (5-2) struck out two and walked one in two
innings for the win. Koji Uehara earned his 18th save, extending
his scoreless streak to 26 innings over 23 games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
