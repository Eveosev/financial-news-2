Kenya  may release this month two
wheat varieties resistant to a stem-rust fungus that U.S.
intelligence views as one of the world’s biggest threats to food
production.  The varieties resistant to UG99, a strain identified in
neighboring Uganda in 1999, “will be named and released for
farm use in weeks,” Miriam Kinyua, a plant breeder at the
University of Eldoret, 165 miles (265 kilometers) northwest of
Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, said yesterday in an interview.  Tests to help find the varieties were partly done at the
Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency using nuclear
technology, and the University of Eldoret, the IAEA said in an
e-mailed statement Sept. 4. UG99 can destroy 70-100 percent of
the yield of wheat plants if no fungicides are applied, it said.  UG99, which can be transmitted by wind, spread from Uganda
to Kenya,  Ethiopia ,  Sudan ,  Mali ,  Jordan , Iran, Turkey, Syria and
Yemen in about four years and may “risk global wheat production
if not contained,” Qu Liang, Director of the Joint Food
Agriculture Organization/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in
Food and Agriculture, said in an interview in Eldoret.  In a statement to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence in March, James R. Clapper, the director of
national intelligence, said the disease may cause “a near-term
supply disruption” when it arrives in South Asia, “which is
likely to happen within the next few years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
