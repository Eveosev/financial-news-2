Former  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) ’s former
head of investor relations agreed to pay a $50,000 fine for
telling some analysts and investors in September 2011 the
company was unlikely to get a U.S. Energy Department loan
guarantee.  Lawrence Polizzotto told at least one analyst and one
institutional investor that “they should assume First Solar
would not receive the Topaz loan guarantee,” the Securities and
Exchange Commission said in an order today.  The 550-megawatt Topaz project in California was one of
three solar farms that had received conditional approval for
guarantees worth a total of about $4.5 billion. First Solar fell
the most in almost two years after announcing Sept. 22, 2011,
that Topaz hadn’t qualified for the support.  Warren Buffett ’s
MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. agreed to buy the $2 billion
project in December 2011.  The company notified the SEC of the selective disclosure in
2011. Polizzotto didn’t admit or deny the findings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
