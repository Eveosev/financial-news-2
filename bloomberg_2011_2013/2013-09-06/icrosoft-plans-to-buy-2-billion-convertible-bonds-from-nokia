Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  is to buy 1.5
billion euros ($2 billion) of convertible bonds from  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) 
to help the Finnish company repay loans it used to fund the
buyout of Nokia Siemens Networks.  The securities will be redeemed on completion of
Microsoft’s $7.2 billion acquisition of Nokia’s handset
business, according to a statement from the Espoo, Finland-based
company.  Nokia agreed to buy  Siemens AG (SIE) ’s 50 percent share in Nokia
Siemens Networks in July for 1.7 billion euros. It raised 1.2
billion euros of loans arranged by JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
borrowed 500 million euros from Siemens, people familiar with
the debt said at the time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
