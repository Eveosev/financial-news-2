Developers of solar and wind farms
in  Brazil  have registered 93 percent of the projects enrolled in
a government-organized auction for new power plants scheduled
for Nov. 18.  Companies registered 629 wind farms with a total 15,042
megawatts of capacity and 119 solar plants with 3,019 megawatts,
energy agency Empresa de Pesquisa Energetica, known as EPE, said
yesterday on its  website .  Developers proposed 17 hydroelectric dams with 340
megawatts of capacity and 19 plants that run on either biogas,
biomass or natural gas with a total of 1,012 megawatts,
according to the statement.  The so-called A-3 bid is for power plants coming online by
Jan. 1, 2016, and was originally planned for Oct. 25, EPE said
Aug. 19 in a  statement  on its website. It will be Brazil’s first
auction to include solar plants.  In Brazil’s power auctions, regulators set a ceiling rate
and developers bid down the amount at which they are willing to
sell power. The lowest bids win contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
