PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) ,
the second-largest U.S. regional bank, is winding down Market
Street Funding LLC, a commercial-paper company it administers.  Market Street had $5.9 billion of the short-term debt
outstanding as of June 30, Pittsburgh-based PNC said today in a
regulatory filing. The bank said it will fund Market Street’s
loans and commitments “utilizing its diversified funding
sources.”  The wind-down is part of PNC’s “strategy to diversify and
extend its borrowing base, particularly in light of ongoing
regulatory developments,” the bank said in the filing.  The  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ’s liquidity
coverage ratio, scheduled to be phased in starting in two years,
requires banks to hold enough “high-quality liquid assets” --
predominantly cash and government debt -- to survive 30 days of
stress. The Basel group earlier this year expanded the types of
assets that can be counted as liquid.  The decision isn’t expected to have a material impact on
PNC, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
