(Corrects to show pace of inflation was below median
estimate in third paragraph.)  Colombia ’s peso bond yields fell the
most since March as lower-than-forecast inflation fueled
speculation that the central bank will reduce borrowing costs as
soon as this month.  Yields on the government’s peso-denominated debt due in May
2014 dropped 23 basis points, or 0.23 percentage point, to 3.82
percent at 9:49 a.m. in Bogota, the lowest level on a closing
basis since May 28, according to the stock exchange. The price
rose 0.14 centavo to 103.565 centavos per peso.  The pace of annual consumer price increases  quickened  to
2.27 percent in August, the government said after markets closed
yesterday, below the 2.34 percent median estimate of 23
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Analysts projected
accelerating inflation after protests by farmers and truckers in
August pushed food prices higher.  “Inflation came in pretty low,”  Camilo Perez , head
analyst at  Banco de Bogota SA (BOGOTA) , the nation’s second-biggest bank,
said in a phone interview. “It increases the chances for a rate
cut soon.”  Banco de la Republica, led by Governor Jose Dario Uribe,
kept its overnight lending rate at 3.25 percent on Aug. 30.
Policy makers said in a statement released with the decision
that they aren’t ruling out the possibility of a reduction. The
next meeting is Sept. 27. The central bank targets inflation of
3 percent, plus or minus one percentage point.  The peso rose 0.4 percent to 1,948.24 per  U.S. dollar  today
and headed for a fourth straight weekly drop, depreciating 0.8
percent in the past five days.  Colombia’s Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas , who has
repeatedly said the peso’s “equilibrium” level is 1,900 to
1,950, said on Todelar Radio Sept. 3 that there is an “optimum
point after which a weaker  exchange rate  starts to become a
problem.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
