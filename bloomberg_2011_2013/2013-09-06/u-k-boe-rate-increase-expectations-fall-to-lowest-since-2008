The  Bank of England  said
expectations for a rate increase in the coming year fell to the
lowest since the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. after Governor  Mark Carney  introduced forward
guidance.  Twenty nine percent of people expect an increase, down from
34 percent in May, the BOE said in its quarterly Inflation
Attitudes survey published in  London  today. That’s the lowest
since November 2008 and the fourth lowest since the survey began
in 1999. The poll of 2,050 people was conducted Aug. 8-13.  Carney introduced his guidance framework on Aug. 7, when he
said policy makers won’t consider raising the benchmark interest
rate from a record-low 0.5 percent until unemployment falls to 7
percent. The pledge is subject to a “knockout” if inflation
expectations become dislodged.  In today’s survey, conducted by Gfk NOP Ltd., the median
expectation for inflation in the next 12 months was 3.2 percent,
down from 3.6 percent in May. Consumer-price growth was 2.8
percent in July, and has held above the bank’s 2 percent target
since December 2009.  The median expectation for inflation at a two-year horizon
was 3 percent in August, down from 3.3 percent in May, and the
five-year outlook was 3.5 percent, versus 3.6 percent, according
to today’s survey.  Respondents were also asked about the inflation target, and
46 percent said it was “about right.” Assessing how the BOE is
“doing its job to set  interest rates  to control inflation,”
the net satisfaction balance was 15 percent, compared with 17
percent in May. Carney took over the BOE from  Mervyn King  in
July.  The BOE kept its benchmark rate unchanged yesterday and
held its asset-purchase plan at 375 billion pounds. The MPC said
the decision was taken in light of the forward guidance
arrangements announced in August. Unemployment was 7.8 percent
in the second quarter and the BOE has forecast that it won’t
fall to its 7 percent threshold until the end of 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
