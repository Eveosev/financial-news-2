Newark  Mayor Cory Booker has earned
$3.86 million since 1998, according to disclosures released by
his U.S. Senate campaign, and will leave Waywire LLC, his
Internet startup, while donating his company shares to charity.  The Democratic U.S. Senate candidate detailed his Waywire
stake valued at $1 million to $5 million in a financial report
to the city just before the August primary in the special
election to serve the remainder of  Frank Lautenberg ’s term. In
June,  New Jersey ’s senior senator died in office.  While Booker won his party’s nomination, he has faced
questions about his wealth, which contrasts with his image of
living in a drug-infested neighborhood in the state’s most-populous city. Addisu Demissie, Booker’s campaign manager, said
in a statement that the release of tax returns for 15 years was
“an historic gesture of transparency,” and called on Steven Lonegan, the Republican nominee, to follow suit.  “What we want to be clear about is that at no point will
the mayor derive any economic benefits from his stake” in
Waywire, Kevin Griffis, a spokesman for Booker, said in an
interview. “We want to remove any lingering doubt that the
mayor wouldn’t be focused solely on his duties” as a senator.  Booker co-founded Waywire, a New York-based video-sharing
website operator, last year. Griffis said Waywire will hold a
board meeting in coming weeks to ratify the mayor’s resignation.  Lonegan Plans  Lonegan, 57, a former mayor of Bogota, New Jersey, released
three years of tax returns to the  New York  Post and plans to
make them available to other reporters on Sept. 9, according to
Will Gattenby, a spokesman.  Booker paid just over $1 million in taxes from 1998 to
2012, his returns show. His income grew from $40,797 in 1998,
when his sole source of earnings came from his position on the
Newark City Council, to a high of $715,981 in 2011.  That was the year his public-speaking engagements brought
in $406,304, and he received a $150,000 separation payment from
his former  law firm , Trenk DiPasquale, according to the returns.
His compensation from the firm on leaving was spread over
several years, and totaled about $690,000 from 2007 to 2012.  “ Cory Booker  has received massive six-figure payouts
following a brief association with a law firm that has received
millions of tax dollars from city agency contracts while he has
been mayor,” Gattenby said by e-mail. “Mayor Lonegan has built
a successful career in the private sector creating real jobs.”  Charitable Giving  Booker reported $149,347 in charitable giving for the 15-year period and a total income of $1.3 million from the
speeches.  A Rhodes Scholar and  Stanford University  and Yale Law
School graduate, Booker grew up in the northern New Jersey
suburb of Harrington Park. In 1996, he moved to Newark, where 26
percent of residents live in poverty.  Booker won the mayor’s race in 2006 and again in 2010. He
gained national attention last year for saving a neighbor from a
fire and for living on  food stamps  for a week to show the
difficulty of relying on the  government aid . A frequent user of
Twitter Inc.’s website, Booker has 1.4 million followers. He
spoke at the 2012 Democratic National Convention and helped lead
its platform committee.  The mayor faces Lonegan in the Oct. 16 special election.
Lautenberg, who died at 89 from complications of viral
pneumonia, would have come up for re-election next year.  In an Aug. 29 poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University’s
PublicMind, Booker led Lonegan among registered voters, 50
percent to 22 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
