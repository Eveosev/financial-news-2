Gemalto NV (GTO)  forecast a doubling of
its operating profit by 2017 amid greater demand for its chips
and software that make bank cards and mobile phones more secure.  Operating profit may reach 600 million euros ($788 million)
that year, doubling from 2012, the Amsterdam-based company said
in a statement yesterday. Revenue from the platforms and
services unit will grow more than 20 percent annually to reach 1
billion euros by 2017, accounting for about half of Gemalto’s
projected sales growth in the period, it said.  Under Chief Executive Officer Olivier Piou, Gemalto has
shifted away from commoditized chips to sell more lucrative
packages including security software. Its clients include
mobile-phone carriers and banks, as well as companies ranging
from Volkswagen AG’s Audi division to Facebook Inc.  Piou, who so far has bet on the need to improve the
security of new technologies -- the likes of mobile payments and
machine-to-machine transmissions -- predicts there are more
opportunities for Gemalto in mobile money and mobile
identification.  Piou returned Gemalto to profit in 2008, and last year net
income rose 25 percent to 201 million euros. Joining  France ’s
leading stock index, the CAC 40, in December, marked another
milestone for the executive. A 55-year-old engineer, Piou has
headed the company since the 2006 merger of Gemplus
International SA and Axalto Holding NV.  Shares of Gemalto have gained 27 percent this year. The
stock slipped 0.7 percent to 86.26 euros yesterday in Amsterdam
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
