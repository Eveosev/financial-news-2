Hong Kong   stocks  swung between gains
as losses as utilities led declines and investors await the
monthly U.S. employment report.  The  Hang Seng Index  gained 0.1 percent to 22,635.39 as of
9:33 a.m. in Hong Kong after falling as much as 0.1 percent. The
gauge is poised for a 4.1 percent advance this week, the biggest
such gain almost a year. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) 
slid 0.2 percent to 10,321.72.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  pared its decline this year to 0.3
percent through yesterday as global manufacturing data added to
signs of a worldwide economic recovery. The gauge traded at 10.8
times estimated earnings, compared with 15 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, also known as the H-share index, has risen 16 percent from its low in June through
yesterday. The measure traded at 1.24 times book value, compared
with a five-year average of 1.77.  Futures on the S&P 500 slipped 0.2 percent today. The
measure added 0.1 percent yesterday in New York, extending gains
for third day, its longest rally since July 22. Data yesterday
indicated the U.S. services industries expanded in August at the
fastest pace in almost eight years. Separate reports showed
fewer applications for  unemployment benefits  than estimated last
week while figures from the ADP Research Institute showed
companies boosted payrolls in August.  The Labor Department’s monthly jobs report, which is due
today, will is expected to show U.S. payrolls rose by 180,000 in
August, while the jobless rate remained at 7.4 percent, a
Bloomberg poll of economists showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
