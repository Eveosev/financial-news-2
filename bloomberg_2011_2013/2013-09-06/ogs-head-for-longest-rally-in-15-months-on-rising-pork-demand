Hog futures headed for the longest
rally in 15 months on speculation that U.S. consumers will buy
more pork as beef costs climb. Cattle rose.  Wholesale  pork  has dropped 6.3 percent since the end of
July, while  beef  jumped 5.1 percent, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. About 443,000 hogs were processed in the
week ending Aug. 31, up 7 percent from a week earlier, according
to the USDA. Through yesterday, futures gained 4.3 percent this
year.  “We’re seeing some consumers who are having trouble with
the high cost of beef,”  Rich Nelson , the chief strategist at
Allendale Inc. in McHenry,  Illinois , said in a telephone
interview. “The dramatic increase in prices we’re seeing in
beef” will prompt more Americans to choose pork, he said.  Hog futures for October settlement climbed 1.3 percent to
90.55 cents a pound at 10:21 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices are headed for the sixth straight gain, which
would the longest string of increases since June 1, 2012.  Cattle futures for October delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$1.2555 a pound in Chicago. Prices dropped 1.4 percent in the
previous four sessions.  Feeder-cattle futures for September settlement fell 0.1
percent to $1.586 a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
