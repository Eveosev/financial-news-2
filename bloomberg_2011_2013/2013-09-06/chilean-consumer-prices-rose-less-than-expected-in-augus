Chilean consumer prices rose less
than expected in August following a drop in health costs,
leaving annual inflation unchanged toward the lower end of the
target range.  Prices rose 0.2 percent in the month, the  National
Institute of Statistics  said in a report released in Santiago
today, compared with the 0.3 percent median estimate of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The inflation rate remained unchanged at
2.2 percent.  A pick-up in annual inflation from 0.94 percent in May has
coincided with stronger-than-expected consumer demand, damping
expectations of an imminent  interest rate  cut. Five of six
economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect policy makers to keep
the key rate on hold next week for the 20th consecutive month,
while one forecast a quarter-point reduction.  Policy makers are looking for “somewhat more significant”
indicators of a slowdown in demand before cutting rates, bank
President Rodrigo Vergara said on Aug. 26. Still, the bank
doesn’t have to “wait until consumer demand has braked,” he
said.  Inflation remains below the mid-point of the 2 percent to 4
percent target range.  The central bank lowered its growth forecast for 2013 on
Sept. 4 to between 4 percent and 4.5 percent from 4 percent to 5
percent citing global conditions  Core prices, which exclude fuel and produce, were unchanged
last month, the statistics agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
