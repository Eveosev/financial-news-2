Allianz SE (ALV) , Europe’s largest
insurer, bought a wind farm in northeast  France , bringing its
renewable-energy investments to more than 1,000 megawatts.  Allianz bought the 20-megawatt wind project in the Haut
Marne region of France from developer Eole-Res SA, Munich-based
Allianz Capital Partners GmbH said today in a  statement  on its
website. The project is being built and is expected to start
working in the middle of next year.  Allianz’s clean-energy capacity is enough to supply the
annual needs of more than half a million homes. It has 42 wind
farms in Germany, Italy, France and Sweden, and seven solar
parks in Italy and France, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
