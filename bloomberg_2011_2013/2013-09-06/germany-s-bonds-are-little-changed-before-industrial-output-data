Germany’s 10-year  government bonds 
rose, pushing yields down from the highest level in 17 months,
as a U.S. labor-market report added to signs a global selloff in
fixed-income securities was excessive.  Benchmark German bunds advanced for the first time in six
days as data showed the U.S. economy added fewer jobs in August
than analysts forecast, damping speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will slow its asset-purchase program at this month’s policy
meeting. Dutch, French and Italian bonds pared weekly declines
after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  pledged
yesterday to keep  interest rates  low. U.S. Treasury 10-year
yields dropped from a two-year high.  “The lower-than-expected U.S. payroll numbers are a
positive for bunds and Treasuries in the near term,” said
 Chiara Cremonesi , a fixed-income analyst at  Unicredit SpA (UCG)  in
 London . “It also increases the probability that the Fed might
delay the tapering of asset purchases, which should trigger some
further correction in bonds.”  Germany’s 10-year bund yield fell 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 1.94 percent at 4:29 p.m. London time after
reaching 2.05 percent, the  highest  since March 21, 2012. The 1.5
percent security due in May 2023 rose 0.835, or 8.35 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,317) face amount, to 96.115.  Hiring Slows  U.S. employers added 169,000 workers last month following a
revised 104,000 reading in July that was smaller than initially
estimated, Labor Department figures showed. The median forecast
of 96 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an August
increase of 180,000. The  unemployment rate  dropped to 7.3
percent, the lowest since December 2008.  The data come as Fed officials, who meet on Sept. 17-18,
are debating whether the economy and job market have improved
enough to warrant trimming monthly $85 billion bond purchases.  German industrial output fell 1.7 percent in July after
rising 2 percent in June, a report from the Economics Ministry
in Berlin showed today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of economists was for a decline of 0.5 percent.  French 10-year bond  yields  fell eight basis points to 2.55
percent, paring their weekly increase to seven basis points.
Dutch 10-year yields dropped nine basis points to 2.38 percent
after reaching 2.47 percent, the highest since April 2012.  Euro-area government bonds dropped 2.1 percent in the past
three months through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World
Bond Indexes, partly as a reaction to the Fed’s plan to
gradually withdraw stimulus from the  U.S. economy . Benchmark
Treasury 10-year yields topped 3 percent today for the first
time in two years before dropping back to 2.90 percent.  Yields Climb  German 10-year yields have increased more than 80 basis
points from a  record-low  1.127 percent set in June 2012 after
the ECB’s pledge to buy the bonds of highly indebted nations
damped demand for the safest assets and  Europe ’s economy emerged
from recession in the second quarter of this year.  Spain ’s 10-year bond yield dropped nine basis points today
to 4.53 percent, while the rate on similar-maturity Italian debt
declined five basis points to 4.50 percent.  Volatility on Finnish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of  Germany  and the Netherlands,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Portugal’s 10-year bonds fell for a fourth day as
Portuguese website Diario Economico reported representatives of
the European Stability Mechanism will visit the nation for the
eighth and ninth reviews of the country’s bailout program
starting on Sept. 16.  Portuguese 10-year  yields  rose 11 basis points to 7.11
percent after touching 7.15 percent, the highest since July 18.  German bonds lost 3.1 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italian securities
returned 2.9 percent, while Spain’s earned 7.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
