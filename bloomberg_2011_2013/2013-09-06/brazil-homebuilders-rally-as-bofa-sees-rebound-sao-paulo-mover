Brazilian homebuilders rallied,
sending  Gafisa SA (GFSA3)  to a three-week high, after  Bank of America 
Corp. predicted a rebound as the pace of construction quickens.  Gafisa advanced 3.2 percent to 3.20 reais at 1:59 p.m. in
 Sao Paulo , the biggest gain on the BM&FBovespa Real Estate
index, which added 0.9 percent. Shares of Rio de Janeiro-based
 PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos e Participacoes (PDGR3) ,  Brazil ’s second-biggest homebuilder by sales,  rose  2.6 percent to 2.36 reais.  Home construction climbed 20 percent in the first six
months of the year to 65,000 units, “boding well for cash
generation and margins normalizing at higher levels,” Guilherme Vilazante, Daniel Gasparete and Carlos Peyrelongue, analysts at
Bank of America, wrote in the note dated yesterday. “The market
still largely downplays this turnaround.”  The bank raised its recommendation on PDG to buy, making it
one of the top picks in the industry along with Gafisa.  Bank of America also increased its recommendation on  Rossi
Residencial SA (RSID3)  and  MRV Engenharia e Participacoes SA (MRVE3)  to hold
from sell. Rossi  gained  3.1 percent to 3.01 reais. MRV  added  2.6
percent to 9.02 reais, the highest since April 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
