Australian bonds fell, pushing the
benchmark 10-year yield to its highest in 17 months, before a
U.S. Labor Department report that may show jobs growth
accelerated last month in the world’s largest economy.  The Aussie and New Zealand dollars maintained declines from
yesterday on prospects the report will fuel expectations that
the  Federal Reserve  will reduce its bond purchases this month,
slowing a program that has devalued the greenback. Both
currencies are set to advance this week on data showing  China ’s
manufacturing expanded and the euro-area economy returned to
growth. The Aussie’s share of global currency turnover rose one
percentage point to about 8.5 percent, the central bank said
today citing a  survey  by the  Bank for International Settlements .  “The U.S. growth story is very important as is the better
economic data coming out of  Europe , because if you get a
recovery in global demand, that benefits Australian exports,”
said Philip Brown, a fixed-income strategist in Melbourne at
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia , the nation’s largest bank.
“There is scope for the  bond market  to keep selling off, though
it should slow a bit.”  Australia ’s  10-year bond yield  rose as much as eight basis
points to 4.151 percent, the most since April 2012, and was as
4.15 at 10:05 a.m. in Sydney. It has climbed 25 basis points
since Aug. 30, set for the largest increase in three weeks. The
three-year rate touched 2.986 percent, the highest since June
24. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Weekly Gains  The Aussie traded at 91.20 U.S. cents, little changed from
yesterday’s close of 91.22 and up 2.5 percent this week. It fell
0.1 percent to 91.26 yen, paring its weekly advance to 4.4
percent, the most since the period ended Dec. 2, 2011.  New Zealand ’s kiwi rose 0.1 percent to 78.90 U.S. cents. It
gained 2.1 percent since Aug. 30, ending a two-week slide. The
currency was little changed at 78.99 yen and traded 4.1 percent
higher from the end of last week.  The U.S. Labor Department is forecast to say today that
payrolls rose by 180,000 in August, from 162,000 the previous
month, while the jobless rate held at 7.4 percent, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg News poll.  A Bloomberg survey of economists last month showed that 65
percent expected that the Fed will start unwinding its $85
billion a month bond-buying program at this month’s meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
