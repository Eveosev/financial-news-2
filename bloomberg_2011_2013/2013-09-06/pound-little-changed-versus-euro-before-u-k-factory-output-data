The pound rose to a two-week high
against the dollar as data showed U.S. employers added fewer
workers in August than analysts forecast, damping bets the
 Federal Reserve  will pare currency-debasing stimulus measures.  Sterling had weekly gains versus the greenback, euro and
yen after the  Bank of England  yesterday kept its bond-buying
program unchanged and left the main interest rate at a record
low. Gilts climbed as Russian President  Vladimir Putin  said his
nation will assist  Syria  if it’s attacked, spurring demand for
the safest assets. A report today showed U.K. manufacturing
increased for a second month in July.  “The pound is benefiting from investors unwinding long
dollar positions following the data,” said  Neil Jones , the head
of European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in  London . “I
see further upside for the pound given the positive tone of
recent U.K. economic data.”  A long position is a bet that an asset’s value will rise.  The pound appreciated 0.3 percent to $1.5632 at 4:49 p.m.
London time after climbing to $1.5681, the highest since Aug.
21. It gained 0.8 percent this week. Sterling was little changed
at 84.23 pence per euro, erasing an advance that took it to
83.92 pence, the strongest level since Jan. 24.  The  U.S. economy  added 169,000 workers last month following
a revised 104,000 rise in July that was smaller than initially
estimated. That compared with an increase of 180,000 projected
by analysts.  The pound has strengthened 6.6 percent over the past six
months, the best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, amid optimism
U.K. growth is accelerating. The euro gained 3.7 percent and the
dollar climbed 2 percent.  Factory Data  U.K.  factory output  rose 0.2 percent from June, when it
gained a revised 2 percent, the  Office for National Statistics 
said today in London. The increase was in line with the median
forecast of 23 analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.
Industrial output was unchanged, the statistics office said.  A separate report showed the U.K.’s  trade deficit  increased
to 9.85 billion pounds in July from a shortfall of 8.2 billion
pounds in June. The median forecast of 17 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey was for a deficit of 8.2 billion pounds.  Ten-year gilt yields dropped seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 2.94 percent after reaching 3.01 percent
yesterday, the highest since July 27, 2011. The rate increased
16 basis points this week. The 2.25 percent security due
September 2023 rose 0.6, or 6 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 94.1.  Yield Spread  The extra yield  investors demand  to hold U.K 10-year gilts
instead of German bunds widened to 100 basis points for the
first time since May 2010 today.  The U.S. jobs data tempered speculation that the Fed will
start slowing monetary stimulus this month.  Fed policy makers are debating whether the economy is
strong enough to allow them to pare monthly purchases of $85
billion in Treasuries and mortgage debt. They next meet on Sept.
17-18.  The Bank of England’s nine-member Monetary Policy Committee
led by Governor  Mark Carney , meeting for the first time since
introducing forward guidance on  interest rates  last month, held
the asset-purchase  target  at 375 billion pounds yesterday. It
also kept its official  interest rate  at 0.5 percent.  Under the central bank’s guidance policy, the MPC plans to
keep its key interest rate on hold as long as unemployment
exceeds 7 percent. The jobless rate was at 7.8 percent,
according to data released on Aug. 14.  U.K. government bonds lost 5.1 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German
securities dropped 3.1 percent and Treasuries declined 4.3
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
