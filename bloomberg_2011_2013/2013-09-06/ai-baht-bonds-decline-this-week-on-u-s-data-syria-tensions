Thailand ’s baht was set for its
fourth weekly decline, the longest losing streak in three
months, and bonds fell before U.S. jobs data that may influence
expectations for when the Federal Reserve will rein in stimulus.  The baht dropped to a three-year low ahead of data today
that may show U.S. employers added 180,000 jobs in August after
an increase of 162,000 the previous month, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Global
investors sold $31 million more Thai equities than they bought
this week through yesterday, exchange data show, amid concern
the U.S. is moving closer to a military strike against Syria.  “The biggest focus in the market now is the U.S.
employment data to assess the outlook for the Fed’s reduction in
stimulus,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan
Center for Economic Research in  Tokyo . “Emerging-market
currencies and assets are under downward pressure and such
severe conditions will probably continue for a while. Syria
tensions are adding to weak sentiment.”  The baht lost 0.7 percent this week and 0.2 percent today
to 32.37 per dollar as of 8:38 a.m. in Bangkok, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 32.41 earlier,
the weakest level since July 2010.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, climbed 32 basis
points, or 0.32 percentage point, to 7.53 percent this week. The
gauge was little changed today.  The Fed will start to slow its $85 billion a month of bond
purchases at its Sept. 17-18 meeting, according to 65 percent of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg last month. The U.S. Senate
Foreign Relations Committee voted 10-7 this week in favor of a
resolution authorizing limited action against  Syria .  The yield on Thailand’s 3.625 percent sovereign bonds due
June 2023 rose 10 basis points from a week ago and two basis
points today to 4.42 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
That is the  highest level  for a benchmark 10-year note since
November 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
