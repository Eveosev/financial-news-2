Copersucar SA, the Brazilian sugar
and ethanol trader, will receive a 500 million-real ($217.7
million) loan from state development lender Banco Nacional de
Desenvolvimento Economico e Social to store renewable fuel.  The funds will be disbursed by Banco Itau BBA, Banco
Santander SA, Banco Bradesco SA and Banco Safra SA, Rio de
Janeiro-based BNDES said today in an e-mailed statement.  Copersucar traded 4.5 billion liters (1.2 billion gallons)
of ethanol during the last harvest season, about 20 percent of
the countryâ€™s total production, according to the statement.  BNDES will furnish the funds from its so-called PASS credit
line, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
