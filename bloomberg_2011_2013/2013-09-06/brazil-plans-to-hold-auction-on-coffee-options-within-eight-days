Brazil , the largest coffee grower,
will hold an auction on contracts for as much as 3 million bags
of the beans within eight days, a government official said.  The state-controlled bank  Banco do Brasil  will receive 1
billion reais ($434.6 million) to finance coffee growers’
inventories and costs to help farmers hurt by the lowest prices
in four years, Janio Zeferino da Silva, head of Agriculture
Ministry Coffee department, said.  “They need funds to keep producing,” Silva said in a
phone interview from Brasilia. “With the auction, we are taking
off the market coffee that could be exported.”  Coffee prices have dropped 20.76 percent this year in  New
York  trading. To help growers, Brazil President  Dilma Rousseff 
announced in August a series of measures such as the options
auction at 343 reais per 60-kilogram bag and 3.16 billion reais
in government loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
