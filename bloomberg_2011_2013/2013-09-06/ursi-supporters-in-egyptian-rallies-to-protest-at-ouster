Supporters of  Egypt ’s Muslim
Brotherhood and ousted President Mohamed Mursi filled the
streets of cities chanting “down with military rule.”  Protesters poured out of mosques after Friday prayers and
marched through Cairo, Giza, Assiut, Helwan and Alexandria, live
televised footage showed. They also held demonstrations in at
least six other locations including Port Said, Minya and Nasr
City, the Brotherhood said in an e-mailed statement.  Nasr City is the Cairo suburb where a bomb exploded near a
convoy carrying Egypt’s Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim
yesterday. A civilian died of wounds sustained in the attack,
deputy ambulance service chief Ahmed al-Ansari said by phone
today. At least 21 people, including 10 policemen, were injured
in the possible suicide blast, the  Interior Ministry  said
yesterday.  Last month, authorities forcibly broke up sit-ins by Mursi
supporters, triggering a week of bloodshed and violence that
left about 1,000 people dead. Ibrahim backed the military’s July
3 ouster of the Islamist president and his security forces led
the operation against the sit-ins.  Sherif Shawki, a prime ministerial aide, said today that
the government is considering revoking the Brotherhood’s
charitable status, though it hasn’t made a decision yet, the  BBC 
reported. Dozens of senior Brotherhood figures have been
arrested in the last two months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
