Sugar rose to the highest in almost
three weeks in  New York  as rising demand may mean a smaller
surplus and a stronger Brazilian real reduced the incentive for
exports from the world’s top producer. Coffee gained.  Sugar production will outstrip demand by 2 million metric
tons in the 2013-14 season that starts in October in most
countries, according to Czarnikow Group Ltd., which has clients
in 83 countries. That’s down from a previous forecast of 3.9
million tons. The Brazilian real gained yesterday for a fourth
session and reached the highest since Aug. 14. A stronger local
currency reduces the incentive for exports priced in dollars.  “We’ve had a couple of bullish news this week, with a
stronger real, some patchy rains in the center south of  Brazil 
and a large trade house reducing their surplus for 2013-14,”
 Kona Haque , an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in  London , said
by phone today. “Sucrose content is running behind last year,
so any additional rainfall will affect that further.”  Raw sugar for delivery in October rose 1 percent to 16.68
cents a pound by 6:26 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York and
touched 16.69 cents, the highest since Aug. 19. White sugar for
October delivery gained 1.4 percent to $491.70 a ton on NYSE
Liffe in London.  Rain this week disrupted harvesting in parts of center
south, Brazil’s main growing region, Sao Paulo-based weather
forecaster Somar Meteorologia said in a report two days ago.
Sucrose content in cane was 1.1 percent lower in the second half
of August compared to the first 15 days of the month, data from
industry group Unica showed.  Coffee, Cocoa  Arabica coffee for December delivery advanced 0.9 percent
to $1.1785 a pound on ICE. Robusta coffee for delivery in
November was 0.5 percent higher at $1,768 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Robusta coffee stockpiles with a valid grading certificate
in warehouses monitored by NYSE Liffe were 77,030 tons on Sept.
2, down 2.2 percent from 78,750 tons two weeks earlier.  Cocoa for December delivery gained 0.1 percent to $2,569 a
ton in New York. Cocoa for December delivery was down 0.1
percent to 1,703 pounds ($2,651) a ton in London.  Cocoa jumped 23 percent yesterday from a 14-month closing
low on March 4, entering a  bull market . Global demand will
outstrip supply by 209,000 tons in 2012-13, KnowledgeCharts, a
unit of Commodities Risk Analysis in Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania ,
estimates. That’s bigger than the 52,000-ton deficit forecast by
the International Cocoa Organization. The shortage next season
will amount to 188,000 tons, KnowledgeCharts data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
