Defending champion  Serena Williams 
strolled back into the U.S. Open women’s final with a straight-set defeat of Li Na, and will face  Victoria Azarenka  for the
title for the second straight year.  The top-seeded Williams, 31, of the U.S., a four-time U.S.
Open champion, won 6-0, 6-3 on her seventh match point against
the fifth-seeded Li, from China. Williams will be seeking her
17th Grand Slam singles title in the final in two days.  The second-seeded Azarenka, 24, from Belarus, who defeated
unseeded Italian Flavia Pennetta 6-4, 6-2 in the earlier
semifinal, lost in three sets to Williams in last year’s final
after serving for the match.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
