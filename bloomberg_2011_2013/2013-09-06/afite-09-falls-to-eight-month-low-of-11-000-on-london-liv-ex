Eighteen bottles of 2009 Chateau
Lafite-Rothschild sold for 7,080 pounds ($11,000) a case on the
London Liv-ex market this week, 15 percent down from its 2013
high amid selling pressure from investors in top Bordeaux wines.  The vintage changed hands at 7,850 pounds as recently as
mid-July, and the deal on Sept. 3 took it back down to the level
at which it was regularly trading between July and December
2012, according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, tracking leading Bordeaux
vintages, has declined since March 15, paring an eight percent
gain made in the previous 10 weeks to leave it four percent up
since the start of this year. Lafite, a first-growth wine estate
in the Pauillac region on the left bank of the Gironde estuary,
is one of the highest-priced growers of Medoc with Chateau
Latour, Chateau Mouton-Rothschild and Chateau Margaux.  In wine trading during August, “Bordeaux saw the biggest
drops, though many price dips were arbitrary,” according to a
commentary posted by Liv-ex on its website. The period saw
little index movement and “typically light” volumes, it said.  The vintage has declined 51 percent from its peak of 14,350
pounds a case attained in February 2011, and is 29 percent below
the level of 10,000 pounds at which it traded in May 2010 soon
after its release onto the market.  Family Estate  The 2009 Lafite is the estate’s most expensive since the
2000 vintage, and the third highest-priced of the past 20 years,
according to merchant data compiled by Liv-ex. It was rated 99+
on a 100-point scale by U.S. critic Robert Parker, putting it
among the vineyard’s top two of the past 10 years, lagging only
the 2003 vintage, which scored a perfect 100.  Parker described it in an online tasting note last year as
“a full-bodied wine revealing the classic elegance, purity and
delineated style of Lafite,” while going through a slightly
closed-down phase and needing another 10 to 15 years of bottle
age.  Chateau Lafite-Rothschild has more than 100 hectares (247
acres) planted with red-grape vines. Cabernet Sauvignon
typically makes up from 80 percent to 95 percent of its wine,
with Merlot from 5 percent to 20 percent, and smaller quantities
of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.  The vineyards, owned by  Domaines Barons de Rothschild
(Lafite) , date back at least to the 17th century and the estate
has been under the control of the Rothschild family since being
acquired by Baron James de Rothschild, then head of its French
branch, in August 1868.  To contact the reporter on this story:
