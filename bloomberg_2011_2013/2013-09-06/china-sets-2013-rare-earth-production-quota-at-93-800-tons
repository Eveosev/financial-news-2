China, the world’s biggest supplier
of rare earths, set its production quota for 2013 at 93,800
metric tons.  The full-year quota doubles the first-batch limit set in
January and is unchanged from 2011, according to a statement on
the Ministry of Land and Resources  website  and data compiled by
 Bloomberg News . The ministry didn’t provide information on the
output quota for last year. The production limit includes 75,900
tons for the so-called light rare earths and 17,900 tons for the
heavy group, it said.  China imposed production and export limits on rare earths,
a group of 17 chemically similar elements used in mobile phones,
hybrid cars and missile systems, in 2007 to conserve resources
and reduce pollution. The curbs raised trade disputes with the
world’s major users, including the U.S. and  Japan .  China also set a production quota for tungsten concentrate
at 89,000 tons and antimony ore at 98,000 tons, the ministry
said in the statement, without giving comparative numbers for
previous years.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
