Swiss  consumer prices  remained
unchanged for a second month in August after more than 1 1/2
years of annual declines.  Prices held steady percent from a year earlier, the same as
in July, the Federal Statistics Office in Neuchatel said in an
e-mailed statement today. That’s in line with the median
forecast of 16 economists in a Bloomberg News  survey . In the
month, prices decreased 0.1 percent.  The  Swiss National Bank  imposed a franc ceiling of 1.20
versus the euro two years ago, citing the risks of deflation and
a recession. While the measure has helped  Switzerland  dodge the
18-month slump that afflicted the neighboring euro area,
consumer prices declined for the longest stretch since at least
1971, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The SNB, which expects consumer prices to decline 0.3
percent this year, has “absolutely no reason” to give up the
cap, considering the need to keep prices stable and the chance
of the euro-area crisis flaring up again, President Thomas
Jordan said in a Berner Zeitung interview earlier this week.  The cost of imported  consumer goods  fell 0.3 percent from
the previous month and 1.8 percent from a year earlier, today’s
report showed. Prices of domestic goods remained unchanged from
July and rose 0.6 percent from a year earlier.  Under a European Union harmonized method, Swiss consumer
prices fell 0.4 percent from the previous month and advanced 0.4
percent from August 2012, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
