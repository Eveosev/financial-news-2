Asian  stocks  dropped, snapping a
six-day advance and paring the regional benchmark index’s
biggest weekly gain since July, as investors await the monthly
U.S. jobs report.  Sumitomo Realty & Development Co. (8830)  lost 1.4 percent as
Japanese developers retreated ahead of a decision this weekend
on whether Tokyo will host the 2020 Olympics.  SoftBank Corp. (9984) 
fell 2.2 percent after competitor NTT DoCoMo Inc., Japan’s
largest mobile-phone carrier, was said to be near an agreement
to offer Apple Inc.’s iPhone. BBMG Corp. rose 2.6 percent in
 Hong Kong  after the cement maker announced a share sale.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell less than 0.1 percent to
133.24 at 7:59 p.m. in Tokyo. The gauge has risen 2.4 percent
this week. U.S. payrolls figures today may add to signs of an
improving jobs market ahead of the  Federal Reserve ’s Sept. 17-18
meeting, when it will gauge whether the world’s biggest economy
can withstand a reduction in unprecedented stimulus.  The jobs data today “is a very important number because it
is the number that Fed policy is benchmarked against,” Peter Esho, chief market analyst at Invast Securities Co., said by
phone. “A discussion around employment is going to drive the
outcome of the Fed’s meeting later this month.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed. Japan’s Topix index slid 0.9 percent. The MSCI Asia
Pacific excluding Japan Index gained 0.4 percent, completing a
seven-day rally, its longest winning streak since December.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index added 0.1 percent, while
China’s Shanghai Composite climbed 0.8 percent. New Zealand’s
NZX 50 Index slid 0.2 percent. South Korea’s Kospi index rose
0.2 percent. Singapore’s Straits Times Index added 0.3 percent.  Australian Election  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  gained 0.1 percent ahead of
tomorrow’s election, which polls indicate will see Prime
Minister  Kevin Rudd ’s minority Labor government lose to  Tony
Abbott ’s Liberal-National coalition.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 3 percent this year
through yesterday, trailing a 16 percent surge on the  S&P 500 .
Benchmark gauges in Hong Kong and Singapore posted two of the
three biggest declines among 24 developed markets amid concern
about China’s slowdown, while the region’s  emerging markets  were
roiled by outflows as investors dumped risk assets.  Speculation the Federal Open Market Committee will dial
down bond purchases at its meeting this month has pushed up U.S.
bond yields and contributed to the worst rout in the currencies
of developing nations in five years.  Claims (INJCJC)  for U.S. unemployment benefits declined by 9,000 to
323,000 in the week ended Aug. 31, less than the lowest estimate
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Another report showed
companies boosted employment by 176,000 workers in August,
according to the ADP Research Institute.  Payrolls Forecast  The number of workers on nonfarm payrolls in the U.S.
probably increased 180,000 in August, compared with a gain of
162,000 for July, according to the median of 94 economists’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan’s Topix climbed 3.8 percent this week, extending this
year’s surge to 34 percent, best among developed markets tracked
by Bloomberg. Shares have jumped amid optimism Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe and the Bank of Japan can lead the country out of
deflation with stimulus and reforms.  China’s Shanghai Composite Index has declined 5.7 percent
this year. Slower growth was a conscious choice by the
government to allow it to adjust the nation’s economic
structure, President  Xi Jinping  said Sept. 3.  Olympic Bid  Losses in Japan today were driven by real-estate and
construction companies, which may suffer if Tokyo loses the vote
to select the host of the 2020 Summer Games. Madrid’s bid  has
the support of 50 out of 98 members of the International Olympic
Committee, Spanish newspaper El Mundo reported yesterday.  Sumitomo Realty slid 1.4 percent to 4,540 yen.  Tokyu Land
Corp. (8815)  lost 3.2 percent to 960 yen.  SoftBank competitor DoCoMo is near an agreement with Apple
to offer its iconic smartphone this year, people familiar with
the situation told  Bloomberg News . SoftBank slipped 2.2 percent
to 6,380 yen. DoCoMo gained 0.6 percent to 160,500 yen.  BBMG advanced 2.6 percent to HK$5.45 on plans to raise
about 2.8 billion  yuan  ($458 million) in a share sale to its
parent and a fund.  Shipping companies extended this week’s surge after the
Baltic Dry Index of commodity-shipping rates jumped yesterday to
its highest level since January 2012.  China Cosco Holdings Co. (1919) ,
the nation’s biggest cargo line, advanced 1.3 percent to
HK$3.91. China Shipping Development Co. rose 2.3 percent to
HK$4.43.  To contact the reporter on this story:
