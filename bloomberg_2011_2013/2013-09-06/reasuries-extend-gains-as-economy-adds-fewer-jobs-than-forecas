Treasuries rose, pushing 10-year
note yields down from 3 percent, after a report showed the U.S.
added fewer jobs than forecast in August, damping speculation
the  Federal Reserve  will slow bond purchases this month.  Yields advanced to a two-year high before the Labor
Department report showed the economy added 169,000 jobs last
month, compared with the median forecast of 180,000 in a
 Bloomberg News  survey. Yields remained lower as Russian
President  Vladimir Putin  said his nation will continue to assist
 Syria  if it’s attacked. Fed policy makers are discussing whether
the economy has improved enough to start reducing the asset
purchases they have used to keep borrowing costs low.  “The payroll print was going to draw the line in the sand,
and a stronger number would have confirmed a stronger
probability of tapering,” said  Sean Simko , who oversees $8
billion in assets at  SEI Investments Co. (SEIC)  in Oaks,  Pennsylvania .
“It creates a little more question around the possibility of
tapering. Syria is secondary after the payroll data. It’s a
lingering concern.”  The benchmark 10-year yield fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 2.93 percent at 5 p.m.  New York  time,
Bloomberg Bond Trader data showed. The 2.5 percent benchmark
note due in August 2023 rose 1/2, or $5.00 per $1,000 face
amount, to 96 9/32.  The yield fell as much as 13 basis points, the biggest drop
on an intraday basis since Nov. 7, 2012. It earlier touched
3.005 percent, breaching 3 percent for the first time since July
2011.  Thirty-year bond  yields  fell two basis points to 3.87
percent.  Volume Jumps  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government debt, rose to the most in more
than two months. Volume rose 7 percent to $440 billion, the most
since June 28. The figure is down from a 2013 high of $662
billion reached on May 22 and up from a low of $148 billion on
Aug. 9. The 2013 average is $315 billion.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their net-short  positions  in 10-year note futures in the week
ending Sept. 3, from the most since May 2012, according to U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  Speculative short positions outnumbered long positions by
103,094 contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade, down 7 percent
from 110,825 contracts a week earlier, according to the report.  Market ‘Correction’  U.S. government debt  has lost investors 4.3 percent this
year, which would be the biggest annual decline since data going
back to 1978, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes
as of yesterday.  The 14-day  relative strength  index for the Treasury 10-year
yield dropped to 63 after reaching 69 yesterday. A reading of 70
is a level that some traders see as a sign the market measure
has risen too fast and may be due to reverse course.  “We’ve had such an aggressive run, and the market had
priced in so much, that it was ready for a correction,” said
Kathy Jones, a New York-based fixed income strategist at Charles
Schwab & Co., which has $2.12 trillion in client assets.  Treasury yields tumbled as the gain in workers last month
followed a revised 104,000 rise in July that was smaller than
initially estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The  unemployment rate  fell to 7.3 percent, the
lowest since December 2008. It has remained above 7 percent
since November 2008.  ‘Low Gear’  “The economy has been stuck in low gear for years and
nothing seems to be breaking the paradigm of slow growth and
slow job gains,” said  Jay Mueller , who manages about $2 billion
of bonds at Wells Capital Management in  Milwaukee . “The data is
bond-market friendly.”  Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s July meeting
released on Aug. 21 showed members were “broadly comfortable”
with Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s plan to taper purchases this
year if the economy strengthens, with a few saying a reduction
may be needed soon.  The Fed will taper its monthly bond purchases to $75
billion from the current $85 billion pace, according to the
median estimate of 34 economists surveyed today by Bloomberg
News.  The central bank will keep purchases of mortgage-backed
securities at the current $40 billion per month pace, while
cutting Treasury bond purchases to $35 billion per month, from
$45 billion, economists said.  Gross’s View  Bill Gross , manager of the world’s biggest bond mutual
fund, said policy makers will go ahead with a plan to reduce the
central bank’s unprecedented asset purchases even with the
disappointing jobs report.  “I think Bernanke and company are committed to a taper,”
Gross, co-founder Pacific Investment Management Co., said today
in a radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “It will be taper ‘lite’ as opposed to a strong
tapering.”  Fed funds futures show a 7 percent probability that the
central bank will raise borrowing costs in January 2015 for the
first time since the 2008 financial crisis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
