Canada  today will probably report it
added 20,000 jobs in August, economists say, a level that would
keep it on track for the weakest annual payroll growth in a non-recession year since 2001.  Employment gains for the first seven months of the year
were 42,000, down from 126,400 in the same period in 2012. That
means the world’s 11th largest economy needs to add about 30,000
jobs a month for the rest of 2013 to avoid suffering the weakest
annual gain since 2001 except for the recession years of
2008-2009.  The hiring slowdown threatens to hobble the  consumer
spending  that has led economic  growth  since 2008 at a time when
exports, business investment and  government spending  have waned.
Canada, which regained jobs lost in the last recession faster
than all other Group of Seven nations, is also losing its edge
over the U.S. in terms of its jobless rate.  “Everybody has been saying Canada is OK as long as job
growth remains strong,” said  Derek Holt , vice president of
economics for Scotiabank in Toronto. “The wheels seem to have
fallen off in that sense, and that might position the housing
and consumer markets to face a little bit greater risk.”  Wage gains have also slowed, giving consumers less money
for new spending or to pay down near-record debts. Increases in
average  earnings  of permanent employees slowed in July to a
year-over-year pace of 1.35 percent, down from a post-recession
high of 3.9 percent in July 2012.  Spending Restrained  “Consumer spending is being restrained at the moment with
households trying to pay down debt,” said  Paul Ferley ,
assistant chief economist at  RBC Capital Markets  in Toronto.
“If the situation gets complicated further in terms of further
slowing in wage gains thus limiting income growth, it’s an
issue.”  Job gains have slowed this year amid layoffs at
manufacturers such as Milwaukee-based A. O. Smith Corp., which
said in April it’s closing a residential water heater plant in
Fergus, Ontario, with 350 employees, and as governments fire
workers as part of efforts to balance budgets.  Today’s report will show unemployment was unchanged at 7.2
percent in August, down from a peak of 8.7 percent in August
2009, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The U.S. will report at the same time from  Washington 
that  unemployment  was unchanged in August at 7.4 percent,
according to a separate survey.  Canada’s unemployment was 2.2 percentage points lower than
the U.S. rate in November 2010 as the country was hurt less by
the global financial crisis, in part because Canada’s banks
remained solvent and continued lending during the recession.  Employment (CANLNETJ)  in Canada grew by 1.8 percent in 2010, the year
after the slump, more than double the 0.8 percent job growth in
the U.S. That trend has begun to reverse. U.S. employment has
risen 1 percent since December, compared with 0.2 percent in
Canada. U.S. employment has risen 4.3 percent since the end of
2010, compared with 3.2 percent in Canada.  Canada’s relative underperformance is partly a matter of
timing, Holt said. “Our hiring was brought forward to a much
earlier point in the recovery than is evident in other cases
like the U.S.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
