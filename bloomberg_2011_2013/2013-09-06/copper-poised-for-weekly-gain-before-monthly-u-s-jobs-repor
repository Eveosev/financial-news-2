Copper rose for the first time in
three days as investors await a U.S. jobs report that may show
rising employment in the world’s second-biggest user of metals.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange climbed as much as 0.7 percent to $7,155.75 a metric
ton and traded at $7,142 at 9:48 a.m. in  Shanghai , putting it on
track for the first weekly advance since Aug. 16.  U.S. payrolls data today may add to signs of an improving
jobs market after reports yesterday showed service industries
grew at the fastest pace in eight years and jobless benefit
claims fell more than economists predicted. The Federal Reserve
will weigh the data when it meets Sept. 17-18 to gauge whether
the world’s biggest economy is strong enough to withstand a
reduction in unprecedented stimulus.  “The job data is likely to be positive, supporting the
metals market demand outlook,” said Xu Liping, an analyst at
HNA Topwin Futures Co. in Shanghai.  Futures for delivery in December on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 0.2 percent to 51,790  yuan  ($8,462) a ton. Metal
for delivery in December on the Comex in  New York  gained 0.2
percent to $3.25 a pound  On the LME, aluminum, zinc, nickel and lead advanced.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
