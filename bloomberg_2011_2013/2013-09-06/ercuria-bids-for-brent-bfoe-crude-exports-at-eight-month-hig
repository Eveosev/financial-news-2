Mercuria Energy Trading SA failed to
buy  North Sea  Brent crude for a third day even after raising its
bid. Glencore Xstrata Plc sought to sell Russian Urals blend in
the Mediterranean without success.  Daily exports of Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk
grades, which make up the Dated Brent benchmark, will jump to
the most in eight months, loading programs obtained by  Bloomberg
News  showed.  North Sea  Mercuria bid Brent for loading Sept. 28 to Sept. 30 at
$1.26 a barrel more than Dated Brent, 6 cents more than its bid
yesterday, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window.  The trading group was also unable to buy Forties at 74
cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, compared with its bid
yesterday at a premium of 65 cents, the survey showed.  Brent for October settlement traded at $116.45 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $115.33 from the previous session. The November
contract was at $114.75, a discount of $1.70 to October.  BFOE shipments will average 909,677 barrels a day, up 11
percent from 820,000 barrels in September, according to the
plans. This is the highest since February.  Exports of Forties will increase by 7.5 percent from
September to 387,097 barrels a day, the highest since June, a
shipping schedule showed. The volume includes three consignments
that were deferred from this month.  Ekofisk shipments will rise by 29 percent to 309,677
barrels a day in October after an unplanned outage at three
fields triggered a delay of all cargoes in the September
schedule. The plan also includes three deferred consignments.  Brent exports for October are planned at five cargoes of
600,000 barrels each, unchanged from this month, according to a
loading program.  Shipments from Dansk Undergrunds Consortium will be four
consignments of 600,000 barrels each, one less than this month,
a shipping schedule showed.  Exports of Aasgard for October will be five cargoes
totaling 4.275 million barrels, up from 1.455 million barrels
this month, while Alvheim loadings will fall to four lots of
780,000 barrels each from five in September, according to
loading programs.  Urals/Mediterranean  Glencore failed to sell 140,000 metric tons of Urals for
Sept. 18 to Sept. 22 loading at 40 cents a barrel less than
Dated Brent, the survey showed. The grade was last sold at a
discount of 20 cents for an 80,000-ton cargo on Aug. 30.  PKN Orlen SA bought 100,000 tons of Urals for Sept. 22 to
Sept. 26 loading from the  Baltic Sea  via a tender, said three
people who participate in the market, asking not to be
identified because the information is confidential. The cargo
was bought at a discount of about 85 cents to Dated Brent,
delivered to Rotterdam, two of them said.  OAO Rosneft was scheduled to award its tender for Urals and
CPC Blend for loading from October to March on Sept. 5. The
result was not known yet.  OMV AG’s oil production in  Libya  halted since the “last
few days” as unrest spread west,  spokesman Robert Lechner said
by telephone today.  West Africa  Indian Oil Corp. bought two cargoes of Nigerian Qua Iboe
from Exxon Mobil Corp., one Agbami from Chevron Corp. and one
Amenam grade from Total SA via a tender, said four traders who
participate in the market, asking not to be identified because
the information is confidential. All shipments are 1 million
barrels each, and for loading in November.  Vitol Group offered 950,000 barrels of Escravos for
Sept. 15 to Sept. 20 delivery to Rotterdam or Lavera,  France  at
$6.25 a barrel more than Dated Brent, the Platts survey showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
