Englandâ€™s first one-day
International cricket match against  Australia  was abandoned
today after heavy rains left the pitch waterlogged.  The game at Headlingley, Leeds, was abandoned without a
ball being bowled. It was the first of five one-day meetings
between the teams. The next match is scheduled be held in two
days at Old Trafford in Manchester. The series wraps up Sept. 16
in Southampton.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
