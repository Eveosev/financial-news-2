Canadian heavy crude strengthened on
the  spot market  for a second day, paring a weekly decline.  Western Canadian Select narrowed its discount to U.S.
benchmark West Texas Intermediate by 65 cents to $24.85 a
barrel, according to Calgary oil broker Net Energy Inc. The
grade, which was $24 below WTI a week ago, slipped early in the
week on expectations that output would rise and demand from
refineries would drop because of planned maintenance.  Syncrude, a light crude processed from oil-sands bitumen,
strengthened 5 cents to a $1.15 discount, Net Energy said.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  said yesterday that oil-sands production
increased 11 percent in August to a monthly record of 433,000
barrels a day.  Canadian Oil Sands Ltd. (COS)  said output from the
Syncrude project rose 15 percent to 210,000 barrels a day.  Several plants that buy Canadian crude are scheduled to
halt for maintenance:  --  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  said yesterday on a community hot
line that it shut its Scotford  refinery , which can process
97,870 barrels a day, for scheduled work.  --  Husky Energy Inc.’s (HSE)  82,000-barrel-a-day Lloydminster
 upgrader , which processes heavy crude into lighter grades, will
shut for 45 days starting in early September, executives said on
an earnings call last month.  -- Suncor said Aug. 1 that it’s planning four to five weeks
of maintenance on the 110,000-barrel-a-day Unit 2 at the Fort
McMurray  upgrader .  --  Northern Tier Energy LP (NTI) ’s 74,000-barrel-a-day St. Paul
Park  refinery  in Minnesota plans to halt a fluid catalytic
cracker during October, the company said during its earnings
conference call in August.  --  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Whiting,  Indiana ,  refinery  will shut a 75,000-barrel-a-day crude unit for 30 days of repairs starting in the
third week of September, according to IIR Energy, a Sugar Land,
Texas, energy information provider.  To contact the reporter on this story:
