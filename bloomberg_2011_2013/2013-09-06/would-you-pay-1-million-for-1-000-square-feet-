With  Celine Dion listing her lavish Jupiter Island, FL estate  for $72.5 million, it's easy to assume that million dollar price tags will get you water slides and 5+ bedrooms with walk-in closets. But in some parts of the country, a high price doesn't necessarily guarantee the largest or most extravagant home. In the Silicon Valley, for example, steep prices  are driving the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world to spend millions of dollars on relatively modest houses . Even actress Kristen Stewart's mom recently  dropped $1 million on a basic Hollywood Hills home . To see what your money buys you across the U.S., here's a look at $1 million listings for single-family residences 1,000 square feet or smaller. Southold, NY (undisclosed address), Southold, NY  For sale: $1.095 million  Size: 1,000 square feet  On the Long Island Sound, $1 million gets you a 1,000-square-foot house right on the beach. A back deck facing the water is a selling point of the cozy 3-bedroom, but don't expect to have multiple cooks in the kitchen. San Clemente, CA 1880 N El Camino Real SPC 11, San Clemente, CA   For sale: $1.899 million  Size: 1,000 square feet  San Clemente is one of several oceanfront locations in California with high home values. This home offers 2 bedrooms for close to $2 million. Fortunately, outdoor entertaining is possible year-round in SoCal, and this home has a spacious backyard with a spa and outdoor kitchen. Edgartown, MA 147 S Water St, Edgartown, MA   For sale: $1.395 million  Size: 864 square feet  On Edgartown's prestigious South Water Street, $1.4 million gets you 864 square feet built in the '70s. While the home's location is ideal, a buyer who favors contemporary design will likely want to make some cosmetic updates. New London, NH 112 Herrick Cove Ln, New London, NH   For sale: $999,000  Size: 954 square feet  You might think living on a lake would cost less than than living on the ocean, but on New Hampshire's Lake Sunapee, 954 square feet is priced at just under $1 million. The lot, however, spans 1.45 acres, providing plenty of space to add onto the home or do some luxe beachfront landscaping. Sammamish, WA 2823 E Lake Sammamish Pkwy SE, Sammamish, WA   For sale: $1.025 million  Size: 920 square feet  This home is a great example of how you often pay more for the location than the house itself. Measuring 920 square feet, the home is small but located about 30 minutes from Seattle on Lake Sammamish, an ideal escape for city commuters. It's also in close proximity to top-rated elementary, middle and high schools.
