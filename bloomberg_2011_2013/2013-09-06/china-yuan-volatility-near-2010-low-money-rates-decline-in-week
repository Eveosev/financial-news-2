Volatility in the yuan was near a
three-year low after the People’s Bank of  China  signaled it is
prepared to manage the impact of a stimulus reduction by the
 Federal Reserve . Money-market rates fell this week.  PBOC Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  said China has ample measures
to cope with any halt in quantitative easing policies, used to
pump money into markets via asset purchases, by developed
nations, the official Xinhua News Agency reported today. The
monetary authority has limited changes in the yuan’s daily
 reference rate  to a maximum of 0.05 percent in the past three
weeks, keeping the measure close to 6.17 per dollar.  “The PBOC has been setting the fix in a stable manner
despite the selloff in emerging-market currencies,” said Khoon Goh, a strategist at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) 
in  Singapore . “That has given comfort that the  yuan  will remain
resilient even as the Fed begins to taper the QE program at the
upcoming meeting.”  One-month implied volatility in the yuan, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell
to as low as 1.01 percent yesterday, the least since June 2010,
from 1.08 percent at the end of last week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It was little changed today at 1.08
percent as of 4:20 p.m. in Shanghai.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.06 percent
today and 0.03 percent this week to 6.2393, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts traded at a 1.9 percent
 discount  to the Shanghai’s spot rate, which was little changed
at 6.1205 versus 6.1199 yesterday and 6.1195 a week ago, China
Foreign Exchange Trade System prices show.  Best Performer  The Chinese currency, this year’s best-performer in  Asia 
with a 1.8 percent gain, is allowed to diverge a maximum 1
percent on either side of the  reference rate , which was lowered
0.05 percent to 6.1728 today. In Hong Kong’s offshore market,
the yuan was at 6.1144, from 6.1165 on Aug. 30, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  China’s money-market rates declined this week after the
central bank’s fund injections helped boost cash supply in the
financial system. The monetary authority added 10 billion yuan
($1.6 billion) to markets via 14-day reverse-repurchase
contracts at 4.1 percent yesterday, according to a statement
posted on its website. The monetary authority pumped in a
similar amount using seven-day reverse repos on Sept. 3.  The  seven-day repo rate , a gauge of cash availability in
the banking system, fell 26 basis points, or 0.26 percentage
point, from Aug. 30 to 3.47 percent in Shanghai, according to a
weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. It rose one basis point today.  The cost of one-year interest rate swaps, the fixed payment
to receive the floating seven-day repo rate, was little changed
today and fell four basis points this week to 4.09 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  China began treasury futures trading today for the first
time in 18 years, enabling investors in Asia’s second-largest
government bond market to limit risk as controls on  interest
rates  and capital flows ease. The most-active December contract
gained 0.02 to 94.192.  To contact the reporter on this story:
