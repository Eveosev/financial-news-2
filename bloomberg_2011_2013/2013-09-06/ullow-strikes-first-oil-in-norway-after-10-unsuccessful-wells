Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  discovered its first
crude off Norway after at least 10 unsuccessful wells this year.  The company together with partners, including  OMV AG (OMV)  and
 Statoil ASA (STL) , made the “breakthrough oil  discovery ” with the
Wisting Central exploration well in the  Barents Sea , Tullow said
today in a statement. The Hoop-Maud Basin find may hold between
60 million barrels and 120 million barrels of recoverable crude,
according to the London-based explorer.  “The discovery is a basin-opener with upside potential”
of as much as 500 million barrels,  Oswald Clint , an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., wrote in an e-mailed report.  The discovery follows the $372 million acquisition of
Spring Energy AS last year. Globally, the company drilled at
least 10 unsuccessful wells this year, including the Augunshaug
in Norway last month, Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. wrote in an
Aug. 29 report. In September, Tullow and Statoil said the
Buzio-1 exploration well in Area 2 offshore Mozambique was dry.  Tullow rose 1.7 percent to 1,050 pence by 10:40 a.m. in
London trading, paring the decline this year to 17 percent.  Separately, Tullow expanded in Namibia after securing a
stake in the EL 0037 permit from  Pancontinental Oil & Gas NL (PCL) ,
the Australian company said today in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
