(Corrects name of Berkshire venture in first paragraph.)  Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, a
venture formed by  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,
added nine real estate broker affiliates in seven states to its
network as it seeks to benefit from the U.S. housing rebound.  The network signed affiliate agreements with two brokerages
each in Texas and California, according to a statement released
today. It also added brokerages in Delaware, New York, Georgia,
Florida and Tennessee.  Berkshire owns HomeServices of America Inc., the second-largest residential broker in the U.S. The business has made
acquisitions in states including Pennsylvania, Missouri, Oregon
and Washington. Buffett, Berkshire’s 83-year-old chairman, has
positioned the Omaha, Nebraska-based firm to expand with the
housing market by investing in a brickmaker and building the
largest stake in  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the top U.S. mortgage
originator.  Realogy Holdings Corp. (RLGY) ’s NRT LLC is the largest U.S.
residential brokerage operator, with more than 700 company-owned
 offices  under brands including Coldwell Banker and ERA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
