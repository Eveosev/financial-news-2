A Spanish judge froze bank accounts
belonging to  Pescanova (PVA)  SA’s former Chairman Manuel Fernandez de Sousa-Faro and companies linked to him after his wife attempted
to send more than $5 million to China.  Judge Eloy Velasco Nunez blocked access to bank accounts in
the names of Fernandez de Sousa-Faro, his wife Maria Rosario
Andrade Detrell, and companies administered by Fernandez de
Sousa-Faro, according to a ruling e-mailed by the court in
 Madrid  today.  Andrade Detrell’s attempt to send funds to China from an
account in Portugal last month was thwarted by Portuguese
authorities, the ruling said. A spokesman for Fernandez de
Sousa-Faro declined to comment on the case.  Pescanova filed for protection from creditors in April and
an audit by  KPMG  found in July that the frozen-fish company used
accounting practices to hide part of its debt. Fernandez de
Sousa-Faro is being investigated by the court for possible fraud
and was ordered this week to put up 178.9 million euros to cover
possible liabilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
