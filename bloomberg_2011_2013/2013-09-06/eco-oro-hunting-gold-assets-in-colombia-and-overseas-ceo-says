Canadian gold explorer  Eco Oro
Minerals Corp. (EOM)  is looking to buy assets in Colombia and
elsewhere.  “There are certain interesting properties that we’ve had
our eye on,” Chief Executive Officer Joao Carrelo said in a
phone interview today. “We’re looking at companies that are
cash-strapped, that because of the gold price are having
difficulties in operating.”  Eco Oro is also looking to push ahead with its Angostura
project and expects a definition on paramo boundaries from the
Colombian government “sooner rather than later.”  The high-altitude ecosystem is not present in its Angostura
mining area, where the company hopes to start gold production as
soon as 2016, said Carrelo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
