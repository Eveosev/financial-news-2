If you think you're already paying too much for an iPhone, be glad you're not an Apple fan in France or Germany. The price of a 16-gigabyte iPhone 5 in those countries is about 40 percent more expensive than one sold in the U.S. Bloomberg Rankings  analyzed prices in 34 international stores Apple lists on its website. The prices were then converted to U.S. dollars on Sept. 3. In the U.S., Apple sells an unlocked iPhone 5 without a mobile contract for $649. So which country was the priciest? Try Brazil, where you'll pay about $368 more than in the U.S.  To see the full rankings of the 20 most expensive countries,  check out our slideshow .
