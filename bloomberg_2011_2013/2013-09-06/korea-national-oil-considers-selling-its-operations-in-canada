Korea National Oil Corp., the state-run energy company, is in initial discussions to sell its
operations in  Canada  as part of efforts to restructure loss-making overseas units.  “We’ve only just started to talk to companies that are
interested in buying the business in Canada,” Choi Hong Seok, a
spokesman at the Anyang, South Korea-based company that is known
as KNOC, said today by phone, without further identifying the
operations.  KNOC’s assets in Canada are mainly held in Harvest
Operations Corp., acquired in 2009 for C$4.1 billion ($3.9
billion), including debt. Harvest has a refinery and produces
about 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, according to
KNOC’s website. It also owns the BlackGold oil sands lease and
gets about 11,000 boe a day from the former Hunt Oil assets,
which it agreed to buy for C$525 million in 2010.  KNOC posted a 904 billion won ($825.7 million) loss last
fiscal year, mainly because of the failure of its overseas
investments,  South Korea ’s National Assembly Budget Office said
in a report on Aug. 27, saying it paid too much for the Harvest
assets.  “Public opinion hasn’t been so great since we haven’t been
doing well with our foreign units,” said Choi. KNOC has been
looking at various ways to improve the profitability of its
overseas assets, Choi said.  Import Reliance  South Korea, which relies on imports for almost all its
energy needs, had focused on investing in overseas assets
between 2009 and 2011 amid competition with  China  and  India  to
secure resources. KNOC completed a hostile takeover of
 Scotland ’s Dana Petroleum Plc for 1.8 billion pounds ($2.8
billion) in 2010. It bought a 50 percent stake in Petro-Tech
Peruana SA of  Peru , now known as Savia Peru, for $450 million in
February 2009 and purchased Harvest eight months later.  KNOC is involved in 26 production projects, 5 development
projects and 26 exploration projects in 23 countries. Daily
crude output from invested fields totaled 240,000 barrels a day
as of June and secured oil reserves reach 1.35 billion barrels,
according to its website.  The talks with potential partners were reported earlier by
MoneyToday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
