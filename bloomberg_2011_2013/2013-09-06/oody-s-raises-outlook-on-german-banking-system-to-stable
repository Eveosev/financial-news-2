Moody’s Investors Service increased
its outlook on  Germany ’s banking system for the first time since
2008, saying lenders have raised capital buffers and their
losses from the crisis are abating.  The upgrade to stable from negative “recognizes that
following a year of reduced crisis-related losses and improved
capital strength, German banks are now more able to withstand an
adverse market environment,” Moody’s said in a statement today.
“Capital levels will further strengthen, even though asset
quality will deteriorate mildly over the next 12 to 18 months as
banks work through their stock of impaired legacy investments.”  Germany has joined countries around the world in ordering
banks to bolster capital to avoid a repeat of the taxpayer-funded rescues of lenders following the 2008 collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. The likelihood of governments stepping in
to save banks is decreasing as policy makers seek ways to wind
down failed lenders, according to Moody’s.  Still, “Moody’s forecasts a deterioration both in earnings
and in efficiency for the German banking system during the 2013
to 2014 outlook period as low interest rates and overcapacities
continue to pressure profit margins,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
