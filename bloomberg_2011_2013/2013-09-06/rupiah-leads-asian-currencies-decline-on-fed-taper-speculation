Asian currencies fell this week, led
by the Indonesian rupiah’s decline to a four-year low, on
concern signs of a U.S. economic recovery will back the case for
a reduction in stimulus that has fueled emerging-market inflows.  U.S. service industries grew in August at the fastest pace
in almost eight years and companies added workers, data showed
this week. Non-farm payrolls are forecast to rise before the
Federal Reserve meets Sept. 17-18 to review its bond-buying
program. Barclays Plc says yields on 10-year Treasuries, which
reached a two-year high yesterday, will lure investors as
exchange data show global funds pulled $141 million from Indian,
 Indonesia , Philippines and Thai stocks this week.  “The battle, which all currencies in Asia are facing, is
rising U.S. Treasury yields and the Fed meeting later in the
month,” said Hamish Pepper, a currency strategist at Barclays
in  Singapore . “Ultimately, that’s going to cap any appreciation
in Asian currencies in the near term.”  The rupiah declined 2.3 percent this week to 11,175 per
dollar as of 10:44 a.m. in Jakarta and reached a four-year low
of 11,205 earlier, prices from local banks show. Malaysia’s
ringgit weakened 1 percent to 3.3170, the Thai baht retreated
0.9 percent to 32.425 and the Indian rupee depreciated 0.6
percent to 66.0638.  Morgan Stanley lowered its 2013 and 2014 growth forecasts
for the four largest Southeast Asian economies of Indonesia,
 Malaysia , Singapore and  Thailand , citing a  weaker-than-expected
first half and an uncertain outlook, economist Deyi Tan wrote in
Sept. 3 note.  Indonesia, Malaysia  Indonesia’s  trade deficit  reached a record $2.3 billion in
July as exports fell on lower global commodity prices, official
data showed Sept. 2. The nation’s current-account shortfall will
narrow in the third quarter, from about 4.4 percent of gross
domestic product in the previous three months as a slowing
economy and higher fuel prices curb imports, Finance Minister
Chatib Basri said in a Sept. 5 interview.  The ringgit was headed for its biggest weekly loss in three
on speculation outflows will accelerate should the Fed begin
tapering stimulus this month. Foreign holdings of Malaysian
government and corporate debt securities fell 5.7 percent in
July to 216 billion ringgit ($65 million), the biggest drop
since September 2011, the latest central bank figures show.  Prime Minister Najib Razak raised fuel prices on Sept. 3,
the first increase since 2010, and delayed some state building
projects with high import content to address a shrinking
current-account surplus. The measures came after Fitch Ratings
said that Malaysia faced the prospect of a rating cut due to its
weak fiscal position.  Won Advances  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index was little changed
this week at 114.26, as the South Korean strengthened 1.3
percent to 1095.45 per dollar and  Taiwan ’s dollar advanced 0.6
percent to NT$29.796.  Non-farm payrolls in the world’s largest economy probably
increased 180,000 in August after a gain of 162,000 in July,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
survey before data due today.  President  Barack Obama  is seeking diplomatic backing for a
U.S. military strike on  Syria  as he attends a meeting of the
Group of 20 nations in St. Petersburg,  Russia .  “The biggest focus in the market now is the U.S.
employment data to assess the outlook for the Fed’s reduction in
stimulus,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan
Center for Economic Research in  Tokyo . “Emerging-market
currencies and assets are under downward pressure at this
moment. Syria tensions are adding to weak sentiment.”  Elsewhere in Asia,  China ’s  yuan  was little changed this
week at 6.1203 per dollar, the Philippine peso climbed 0.2
percent to 44.515 and Vietnam’s dong strengthened 0.1 percent to
21,140.  To contact the reporter on this story:
