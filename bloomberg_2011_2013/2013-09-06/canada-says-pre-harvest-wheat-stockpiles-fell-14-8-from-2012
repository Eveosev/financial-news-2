Pre-harvest wheat inventories in
Canada, the world’s largest exporter after the U.S., fell 14.8
percent from a year earlier, as farmers begin collecting bigger
crops in 2013.  Stockpiles of all wheat varieties totaled 5.057 million
metric tons as of July 31, compared with a revised 5.932 million
in 2012,  Statistics Canada   said  today from Ottawa. On average,
six analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News  expected 5.672 million
tons. Canola reserves fell 14 percent to 608,000 tons, compared
with analysts’ forecast of a 2.8 percent increase to 727,000.  While supplies are down, grain bins will be refilled in
coming months. The government predicts wheat production in 2013
will reach a 22-year high of 30.6 million tons and canola will
jump to 14.7 million tons, the most ever. Minneapolis wheat
prices have tumbled 26 percent in the past year, while Winnipeg
canola futures that in May were the highest since 2008 have
plummeted since then, down 21 percent from a year ago.  “We knew there was a lot of disappearance of grain, and
certainly with prices being as high as they were, the signal was
very strong for farmers to get that grain into the system,”
Jonathon Driedger, a senior market analyst at Winnipeg-based
FarmLink Marketing Solutions, said today on a conference call.
Inventories of non-durum wheat are the lowest since 2007-2008
and reserves of canola are “extremely tight,” he said.  Yield Prospects  Warm, wet weather in late June and early July boosted yield
prospects across Western  Canada . Above-average yields are being
reported in  Saskatchewan , the largest grower of spring wheat and
canola. The yields for canola range between 30 bushels and 36
bushels an acre, the province’s agriculture ministry said. That
compares to an average yield of 24 bushels to 27 bushels across
most of the province a year  earlier , reports show.  “Early yield reports are indicating above-average barley
and spring-wheat yields with good quality and above-average
bushel weights,” Manitoba’s agriculture ministry said in a
Sept. 3  report .  “I don’t think this report is too relevant,” Jerry
Klassen, the manager of Canadian operations and trading at GAP
SA Grains & Produits, said in a telephone interview from
Winnipeg before the report. Reduced grain reserves will have
little impact on prices because good growing conditions across
the Prairies and above-average yield expectations will mean
ample crops this year, Klassen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
