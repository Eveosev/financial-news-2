New York Knicks guard J.R. Smith was
suspended five games without pay for violating the National
Basketball Association’s substance abuse policy.  Smith, 27, who is recovering from knee surgery, will have
to sit out the first five games of the 2013-14 season if he is
healthy by then, the league announced yesterday in an e-mailed
release.  While the league did not specify the nature of the
violation, the collective bargaining agreement calls for a five-game suspension following a third violation involving marijuana.
The first two violations don’t result in suspensions.  Knicks spokesman  Jonathan Supranowitz  declined in an e-mail
to comment on the discipline.  Smith was voted the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year in 2012-13,
coming off the bench to average a career-best 18.1 points, 5.3
rebounds and 2.7 assists per game. Those numbers all dipped in
the postseason as the Knicks were eliminated by the  Indiana
Pacers  in the second round of the playoffs.  The Knicks in July re-signed Smith to a four-year deal
worth about $25 million, according to the Wall Street Journal.  Smith had left knee surgery in mid-July and the Knicks said
then that he would be sidelined for 12 to 16 weeks, which means
he might not be ready for the start of the season.  New York opens the season Oct. 30 against the  Milwaukee
Bucks  at Madison Square Garden. If he is healthy to start the
season, Smith also will miss games against the  Chicago Bulls ,
Minnesota Timberwolves and a pair versus the  Charlotte  Bobcats.  -- Editors: Rob Gloster, Michael Sillup  To contact the reporters on this story:
