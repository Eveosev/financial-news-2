Palm oil headed for a fourth weekly
advance on speculation that rising demand in  India  and  China  may
counter a build-up in stockpiles in Malaysia as output expands
seasonally in the world’s second-largest producer.  Palm for November delivery rose as much as 0.6 percent to
2,427 ringgit ($732) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives, and was at 2,426 ringgit at 12:13 p.m. in Kuala
Lumpur. Futures are poised to climb 0.9 percent this week, set
for the best weekly run since June 7. Palm oil for physical
delivery in September was at 2,415 ringgit yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Futures have rebounded 14 percent since reaching the lowest
price since October 2009 on July 26 on speculation that a rally
in soybeans would boost demand for the cooking oil used in
everything from candy to biofuel. Reserves in  Malaysia  probably
expanded 3 percent to 1.71 million tons in August from 1.66
million tons in July, according to a Bloomberg survey. That
would be 19 percent lower than a year ago, according to data
from the Malaysian Palm Oil Board.  “The stock levels at this juncture are lower than a year
ago, so from a starting point we’re better off already as we
head into the high production season,” Ivy Ng, an analyst at
CIMB Investment Bank Bhd., said by phone in Kuala Lumpur.
“Demand is going to be strong ahead of festive events in India
and China’s Mid-Autumn festival.”  Festival Demand  India, the world’s biggest importer, celebrates the
festival of Diwali on Nov. 3, while markets in China will be
closed for the Mid-Autumn Festival on Sept. 19 and 20.  Futures may trade in a range of 2,200 ringgit to 2,600
ringgit in the near term, supported by a weaker ringgit and
higher crude oil prices, Ng said.  Soybeans for November delivery climbed 0.2 percent to
$13.70 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for
delivery in December advanced 0.8 percent to 43.87 cents a
pound.  Refined palm oil for January delivery climbed 1.2 percent
to 5,636  yuan  ($921) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange.
Soybean oil increased 1.2 percent to 7,278 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
