Gold rose from a two-week low after
U.S. payroll gains last month trailed estimates by analysts,
reviving prospects for extended economic stimulus by the Federal
Reserve and stoking demand for the metal as a store of value.  Employers added 169,000 workers after an increase in July
of 104,000 that was smaller than first estimated, government
figures showed today. The median forecast of 96 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for an August gain of 180,000. Gold
has fallen 17 percent this year partly on speculation that the
Fed would curb bond purchases as soon as this month.  “Today’s data makes it clear that the economy is still
weak,” Carlos Perez-Santalla, a New York-based broker at Marex
North America LLC, said in a telephone interview. “People think
that the Fed may have to delay tapering.”  Gold futures for December delivery gained 1 percent to
settle at $1,386.50 an ounce at 1:37 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price touched $1,358.80, the lowest for a
most-active contract since Aug. 22. The metal has dropped 28
percent from the record $1,923.70 two years ago.  Fed officials are considering whether a rebound in the
economy warrants curbing $85 billion of monthly bond purchases.
Policy makers start a two-day meeting on Sept. 17. Gold rose 70
percent from December 2008 to June 2011 as the Fed pumped more
than $2 trillion into the financial system by purchasing debt.  Gold has climbed 18 percent from a 34-month low in June as
sales of jewelry, bars and coins surged in Asia. Concern that
the U.S. will attack  Syria  for use of chemical weapons against
civilians boosted demand for the metal as a haven.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 2.7 percent to
$23.891 an ounce.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
October delivery advanced 0.9 percent to $1,495.70 an ounce.
Palladium futures for December delivery rose 1.4 percent to
$696.85 an ounce. The price dropped in the previous six
sessions, the longest slump in almost 16 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
