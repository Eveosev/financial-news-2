Taiwan  Minister of Justice Tseng Yung-fu resigned from his position without admitting any
wrongdoing in order to protect the reputation of the office,
according to a cabinet statement yesterday.  The resignation was accepted by Premier Jiang Yi-huah and
Chen Ming-tang, a deputy justice minister, became acting
minister, the cabinet said.  Investigators with Taiwan’s Supreme Prosecutors Office
yesterday  accused  Tseng of illegally interfering in a commercial
crimes prosecution of an opposition party lawmaker. Tseng denied
wrongdoing and pledged to prove his innocence, according to
statement posted on the justice ministry’s website before the
resignation.  President Ma Ying-jeou expressed “shock and regret” in a
statement yesterday and called for a thorough investigation of
the matter. Tseng had held the job since 2010, according to the
ministry’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
