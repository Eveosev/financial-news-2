Rupiah forwards plunged for a fourth
week and bonds declined on concern rising  oil prices  related to
the threat of U.S. military action in Syria will worsen
 Indonesia ’s trade deficit.  The rupiah slid 11 percent this quarter, the worst
performance among 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg, due to record current account and trade shortfalls.
Purchases of oil and gas by Indonesia, a net importer of crude,
increased 50 percent in July, while exports fell for a 16th
month, official data showed this week.  “Oil prices are the key issue, as they feed into the trade,
current account and budget deficits,” said Leo Rinaldy, a
Jakarta-based economist at PT Mandiri Sekuritas, a unit of the
nation’s largest bank by assets. The decline in foreign-exchange
reserves may have slowed in August, providing “some relief,”
Rinaldy said.  One-month non-deliverable forwards fell 4 percent this week
to 11,910 per dollar as of 10:28 a.m. in Jakarta and reached
11,945 today, the lowest level since March 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  In the  spot market , the currency dropped 2.3 percent to
11,175 per dollar from Aug. 30, declining for a ninth straight
week, the longest losing streak since 2004, prices from local
banks compiled by Bloomberg show. The forwards contracts traded
6.2 percent weaker than the spot rate today, the biggest gap
since Aug. 27, when the margin touched 6.6 percent, the widest
since September 2011.  Crude Climbs  The price of  Brent crude  climbed for a fourth week as
President  Barack Obama  meets other Group of 20 leaders in  St.
Petersburg  in an effort to win a measure of political cover for
a military strike on Syria in response to an alleged chemical
weapons attack.  Brent crude rose 1.1 percent this week to $115.29 per
barrel and reached $117.34 on Aug. 28, the highest level since
February. The price may climb to $120 to $125 if the U.S. and
its allies begin military action,  Michael Wittner , head of oil
market research at Societe Generale SA in New York, wrote in a
research report last month.  Indonesia’s  trade deficit  climbed to a record $2.3 billion
in July, while the current-account shortfall widened to $9.8
billion in the second quarter, the largest in data compiled by
Bloomberg going back to 1989.  Bonds Slide  The nation’s foreign-currency reserves fell 18 percent this
year to $92.7 billion in July, the least since October 2010.
 Bank Indonesia  is set to announce the August numbers anytime
through Sept. 10.  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose
260 basis points, or 2.6 percentage points, to 20.99 percent
this week, the highest level since September 2011, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  A  fixing  used to settle the rupiah forwards was set at
11,694 per dollar today, compared from 11,275 on Aug. 30,
according to the Association of Banks in Singapore.  The yield on Indonesia’s sovereign bonds due May 2023
climbed 46 basis points this week to 8.87 percent, the highest
since February 2011, according to prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association.  The  Finance Ministry  rejected all 847 billion rupiah ($73
million) of bids in a debt swap yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
