Treasury 10-year note yields rose to
3 percent for the first time in two years as a strengthening
U.S. employment market increases speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will announce plans to slow its bond-buying program this month.  The  yield  on the benchmark security for everything from
corporate to  mortgage loans  last breached that level on July 27,
2011, when lawmakers debated raising the nation’s debt limit.
Fed officials are monitoring progress in the labor market as
they consider dialing back their $85-billion-a-month program
designed to fuel the expansion. A Labor Department report today
may show companies added 180,000 workers last month and the
 unemployment rate  held at the lowest level since 2008. The Fed’s
next policy meeting is Sept. 17-18.  “U.S. data are driving yields,” said  Tony Morriss , the
head of interest-rate research at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. in Sydney. Prospects for a pickup in payrolls
have “quite clearly brought forward some expectations for when
actual short-term  interest rates  can be raised.”  Benchmark 10-year yields were little changed at 2.98
percent as of 8:11 a.m. London time, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader data. Today’s high was 3.005 percent, climbing from
2013’s low of 1.61 percent on May 1. The 2.5 percent note due in
August 2023 traded at 95 7/8.  Employment Market  Jobless claims declined by 9,000 to 323,000 in the week
ended Aug. 31, less than the lowest estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg, from a revised 332,000, according to
Labor Department data issued yesterday in  Washington . Another
report showed productivity climbed more than previously
estimated in the second quarter.  Companies boosted employment by 176,000 workers in August
from a 198,000 gain in July that was revised down, figures from
the Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Research Institute showed
yesterday. The median forecast of 43 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a 184,000 gain.  The Labor Department report may show the unemployment rate
held at 7.4 percent last month, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey.  The employment “data point will be the deciding factor”
for the Fed, said  Adrian Miller , director of fixed-income
strategies at GMP Securities LLC in  New York .  Value Measure  With yields rising, the 10-year  term premium  signaled that
the securities are the cheapest since 2011. The model, which
includes expectations for interest rates, growth and inflation,
was at 0.63 percent yesterday, the most since May 10, 2011. It
was negative as recently as June 18. The 10-year average is 0.23
percent. A positive reading indicates that investors are getting
yields that are above what is considered fair value.  Accelerating U.S. growth has prompted Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  to pledge to slow monetary stimulus if the economic
expansion meets policy makers’ forecasts. The U.S. central bank
will reduce its monthly purchases at its meeting this month,
according to 65 percent of economists in a Bloomberg survey last
month.  Three-month implied volatility on U.S. 10-year  interest-rate swaps  climbed to 118.8 basis points yesterday, the highest
since July 8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
average over the past year is 79.30. The gauge is a measure of
projected yield fluctuations over the next 90 days.  “We’ve had a strong move to the upside” in yields, said
 Karsten Linowsky , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Suisse
Group AG in Zurich. “Everyone is waiting for these events, like
the payrolls and the Fed meeting, and that’s why we’ve seen
pressure to the upside in yields.”  Rate Outlook  The Fed has kept its  target  for overnight lending between
banks at almost zero since December 2008. Investors see about a
70 percent chance policy makers will raise the so-called federal
funds rate to 0.5 percent or more by January 2015, data compiled
by Bloomberg from futures contracts show.  Pacific Investment Management Co.’s  Bill Gross , manager of
the world’s biggest bond fund, said investors should buy short-term Treasuries and credit securities that will be bolstered by
the Fed’s intent to keep benchmark lending rates at almost zero.  “The safest pitch to swing at may not be stocks, but the
asset that will soon be the nearly sole focus of central
banks,” Gross wrote in his monthly investment outlook posted on
 Newport Beach , California-based Pimco’s website yesterday.
“Instead of QE, central bankers are shifting to forward
guidance, which if reliable, allows financial markets and real
economies to plan several years forward in terms of financing
rates and investment returns.”  Gross’s Pimco  Total Return Fund (PTTRX)  has dropped more than $41
billion, or 14 percent of its assets, during the past four
months through losses and investor withdrawals. The $251 billion
fund suffered $7.7 billion in net redemptions in August,
Chicago-based researcher  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  said yesterday in an
e-mailed statement, the fourth straight month of withdrawals and
the second-highest amount this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
