Treasuries rose, snapping a four-day
rout on speculation benchmark yields approaching 3 percent are
enough to compensate investors for the risk that the  Federal
Reserve  will cut its bond purchases this month.  The 14-day  relative strength index  for the 10-year yield
climbed to 69 yesterday, nearing the level of 70 that some
traders see as a sign a security has moved too fast and is
poised to reverse course. Yields advanced to 2.999 percent
yesterday before a report today that may show gains in U.S.
payrolls accelerated, which would boost prospects for a
reduction in the Fed’s bond purchases as soon as this month.  “We’ve had quite a dramatic sell-off,” said Roger Bridges, who helps oversee the equivalent of about $21.3 billion
as the head of fixed income in Sydney at Tyndall Investment
Management Ltd., a unit of  Japan ’s Nikko Asset Management Co.
“When you start talking about 3 percent for the 10-year bond,
people might start reassessing.”  Benchmark 10-year Treasuries yielded 2.99 percent today as
of 11:38 a.m. in  Tokyo , based on Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The
price of the 2.5 percent security due in August 2023 rose 2/32,
or 63 U.S. cents per $1,000 face amount, to 95 27/32. The last
time the yield was 3 percent was July 2011.  Japan’s 10-year government bond yield climbed 1/2 basis
point to 0.78 percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The Labor Department may say today U.S. companies added
180,000 jobs last month after boosting positions by 162,000 in
July, and the  unemployment rate  held at 7.4 percent, according
to the median forecast of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  ‘Imminent’ Tapering  The Fed is buying $45 billion of Treasuries and $40 billion
in mortgage bonds each month in its quantitative easing program
to support the economy by putting downward pressure on borrowing
costs. A Bloomberg News survey of economists taken Aug. 9-13
showed that 65 percent of them expected a reduction when U.S.
central bank officials next meet on Sept. 17-18.  The yield on Treasuries due in a decade has climbed 20
basis points since Aug. 30, set for the first weekly advance
since the period through Aug. 16. The benchmark has surpassed
analysts’ year-end weighted average forecast of 2.79 percent.  Kazuyuki Takigawa, who oversees $6 billion of non-yen bonds
at Resona Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, said he’s not ready to buy
Treasuries. “It’s better to wait,” Takigawa said. “Tapering
of QE is imminent. The market isn’t ready.” Ten-year yields may
rise to 3.25 percent in two weeks, he said.  U.S. government securities maturing in a decade and longer
tumbled 5.6 percent since June, the biggest decline of 144 debt
indexes tracked by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies.  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , climbed 23 percent to
$410.6 billion yesterday, the most since Aug. 15. The 2013
average is $315 billion.  Three-month implied volatility on U.S. 10-year  interest-rate swaps  climbed to 118.8 basis points yesterday, the highest
since July 8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
average over the past year is 79.4. The gauge is a measure of
projected yield fluctuations over the next 90 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
