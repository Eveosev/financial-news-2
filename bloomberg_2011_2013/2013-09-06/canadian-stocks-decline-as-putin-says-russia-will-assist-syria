Canadian  stocks  fell, after reaching
a five-month high, as technology companies dropped and investors
weighed reports on domestic and U.S. jobs growth amid growing
tensions between America and  Russia  over  Syria .  BlackBerry Ltd. (BB)  dropped 2.7 percent, snapping three days of
gains. Bombardier Inc. lost 1 percent after rallying the most in
four months yesterday. Torex Gold Resources Inc. and B2Gold
Corp. added at least 4.8 percent as the price of gold climbed.
Air Canada, the nation’s largest airline, jumped 3.1 percent
after announcing it will refinance its long-term debt at a lower
cost. Suncor Energy Inc. rose 1.2 percent as crude rallied to a
two-year high.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 24.14
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,820.92 at 4 p.m. in Toronto,
paring the weekly gain to 1.3 percent. The S&P/TSX closed at its
highest level since March 12 yesterday.  “We’re seeing a bit of technical selling after the TSX
reached a short-term high yesterday and has had a pretty good
run the past few weeks,” said Youssef Zohny, a portfolio
manager with Stenner Investment Partners of Richardson GMP Ltd.
in  Vancouver . Richardson GMP manages about C$15 billion ($14.4
billion).  Data (CANLNETJ)  showed Canadian employment increased by 59,200 last
month and the  jobless rate  fell to 7.1 percent from 7.2 percent.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected a 20,000 job increase
and an unchanged jobless rate.  ‘Improved Tone’  “Given the improved tone in the global economy, Canada is
poised to enter a period of higher-than-potential growth
resulting in more consistent gains in hiring and a gradual
decline in the  unemployment (USURTOT)  rate,”  Dawn Desjardins , assistant
chief economist at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to
clients today.  In the U.S., employers added 169,000 workers in August,
following a revised 104,000 rise in July that was smaller than
first reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had called for
a 180,000 gain. Unemployment fell to 7.3 percent from 7.4
percent. The data fueled speculation that any reduction in
Federal Reserve stimulus will be limited.  “People were feeling pretty good about things going in
with the jobs data, but with a print like this, maybe the U.S.
economy isn’t ready for tapering,” said Michael O’Brien, fund
manager with TD Asset Management Inc. in Toronto. The firm
manages about C$216 billion ($207 billion).  Technology stocks declined 1.1 percent as eight of 10
 groups  in the S&P/TSX retreated. Trading volume was 14 percent
below the 30-day average.  BlackBerry dropped 2.7 percent to C$11.29. The smartphone
maker had risen 9 percent in the past three days amid
speculation BlackBerry may sell itself as soon as November.  Niko Resources  Niko Resources Ltd. (NKO)  slumped 10 percent to C$3.68 after
Darren Engels, an analyst with FirstEnergy Capital, lowered his
 rating  to underperform from market perform and cut his price
target to C$3 from C$8.50 after accounting for the company’s
financing needs and potential capital spending.  Suncor gained 1.2 percent to C$36.68 and Bankers Petroleum
Ltd. advanced 3 percent to C$3.80 as crude gained 2 percent to
$110.53 a barrel in New York, the highest since May 2011.  Bombardier lost 1.4 percent to C$4.91. The stock rallied
5.5 percent yesterday, the most since May 9, after announcing
the sale of one of its units along with a jet order worth a
minimum of $1.8 billion.  B2Gold added 4.8 percent to C$2.85 and Torex Gold jumped
8.1 percent to C$1.61. Gold rebounded from a two-week low,
rising 1 percent to $1,386.50 an ounce in New York.  Air  Canada  increased 3.1 percent to C$3.03. The airliner
plans to refinance about C$1.1 billion of its outstanding senior
notes to extend the maturity of Air Canada’s long-term debt and
lower costs of financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
