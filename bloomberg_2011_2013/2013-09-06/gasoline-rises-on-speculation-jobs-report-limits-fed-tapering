Gasoline rose for the first time in
six days on speculation that the Federal Reserve will limit or
delay cutbacks to stimulus efforts after August payrolls rose
less than projected.  Futures advanced as the Labor Department reported that U.S.
employers added 169,000 jobs last month and the  unemployment
rate  fell as more people left the workforce. The Fed, which
meets Sept. 17-18, has said it will consider the health of the
jobs market in timing a tapering of its $85 billion in monthly
bond purchases.  “The market’s interpretation of the jobs report is that
the Fed tapering will be at a slower rate than had been
previously anticipated,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow
Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for October delivery gained 1.99 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.8559 a gallon at 9:41 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange. Trading volume was 18 percent below the
100-day average. Prices have fallen 5.4 percent this week.  The gain of 169,000 workers in August followed a revised
104,000 increase in July that was less than initially estimated.
The jobless rate fell to 7.3 percent from 7.4 percent.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude slipped 13 cents to $10.61 a barrel. The
fuel’s  premium  over Brent widened 48 cents to $4.33 a barrel.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.3 cent to $3.584 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.
Retail gasoline is 23.9 cents below a year earlier.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for October delivery rose 1.53
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $3.155 a gallon on trading volume that
was 46 percent below the 100-day average. Prices are up 0.5
percent this week.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI narrowed 34 cents to $23.16
a barrel while the  premium  over Brent increased 25 cents to
