Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s largest
automaker, said Supervisory Board Chairman  Ferdinand Piech  has
no plans to step down from his post.  “Piech is in the best of health and will remain for a long
time as supervisory board chairman,” the Wolfsburg, Germany-based automaker said in an e-mailed statement today.  VW denied a Handelsblatt report that Chief Executive
Officer Martin Winterkorn, 66, may take over as chairman in the
coming months because Piech is in faltering health.  Piech plans to attend a Monday event in Frankfurt that VW
always hosts on the eve of major auto shows, Spiegel Online
reported today.  The 76-year-old “will also take part in such events as
supervisory board chairman in the future,” Spiegel Online
quoted Piech as saying. “Those who are reputed to be dead, live
longer,” he said of the report that he will step down.  To contact the reporters on this story:
