Billionaire hedge-fund manager  John Paulson  posted a 0.9 percent decline in his Paulson Partners
Enhanced fund last month as stock markets fell, according to a
person briefed on the matter.  The loss reduces gains this year in the fund to 21 percent,
according to the person, who asked not to be identified because
the information is private. Paulson Partners Enhanced is the
leveraged version of the firm’s merger-arbitrage strategy,
Paulson’s largest fund group by assets.  Paulson & Co., based in New York with $18 billion in
assets, posted gains last month in its Advantage and credit
funds and a loss in its Recovery fund.  Armel Leslie , a spokesman for Paulson & Co. with Walek &
Associates, declined to comment on the returns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
