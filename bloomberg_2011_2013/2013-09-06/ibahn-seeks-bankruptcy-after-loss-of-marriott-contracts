IBahn Corp., a provider of Internet
services to hotels, sought bankruptcy protection in Delaware,
citing a loss of contracts with largest customer  Marriott
International Inc. (MAR)  and patent litigation costs.  IBahn Chief Financial Officer Ryan Jonson said the company
had assets of $13.6 million and it listed liabilities of as much
as $50 million in the Chapter 11 filing today in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Wilmington, Delaware.  IBahn, based in Salt Lake City,  Utah , said in a statement
that it appointed Edward Helvey as its new chief executive
officer and that it will continue to operate as it restructures.
Marriott said in the statement that it would remain a “loyal”
customer through the restructuring. The company’s international
operations aren’t included in the bankruptcy filings, according
to the statement.  Marriott in 2009 sought vendor certification to establish
consistent standards at its hotels, according to Jonson’s
filing. IBahn didn’t achieve the certification until 2013, and
lost a third of the Marriott contracts between 2011 and 2013,
Jonson said.  “The loss of revenue has made restructuring of the iBahn’s
business essential to ongoing operations,” he said. Defending
patent litigation has also depleted cash and caused severe
financial strain on the company, Jonson said.  Ibahn was a target of China-based hackers, according to a
U.S. intelligence official familiar with the matter who spoke on
a condition of anonymity in December, 2011.  The case is In re: iBahn Corp. 13-12285. U.S. Bankruptcy
Court District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
