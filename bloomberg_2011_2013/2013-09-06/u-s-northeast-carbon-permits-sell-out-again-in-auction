Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative
Inc., the nonprofit that administers the U.S. Northeast’s
carbon-emissions program, raised $102.6 million as it sold every
available permit for the third consecutive auction.  RGGI sold 38.4 million allowances for $2.67 each at the
Sept. 4 event, according to a  statement  posted today on the New
York-based group’s website. The previous quarterly auction, on
June 5, generated a record $124.5 million as 38.8 million
permits sold for $3.21 each.  Demand has increased since RGGI said in February it would
reduce by 45 percent the number of available permits to emit
carbon dioxide, starting next year. That’s driving up prices as
companies stock up, said Paul Tesoriero, director of
environmental trading at Evolution Markets LLC in White Plains,
New York.  “There’s still a bullish tone for next year,” Tesoriero
said today in an interview. “For the markets to be able to soak
in 40 million tons when it was oversupplied, it’s definitely
people looking into next year and beyond.”  RGGI has sold every permit in its three quarterly auctions
this year. Before the group announced plans to revise the
program in February, the allowances hadn’t  sold  out since March
2011 and prices hadn’t exceeded $2 since March 2010.  Each permit gives a company the right to emit one ton of
carbon dioxide in a cap-and-trade initiative that includes the
six New England states, New York,  Delaware  and  Maryland . States
use the proceeds for renewable-energy and utility programs,
assisting consumers with bills or to pad their general funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
