Namibia ’s Treasury will finance the
building of a 2.87 billion Namibian dollar ($281.5 million) dam
that will be the country’s biggest source of inland water.  Construction of the Neckartal Dam on the Fish River in the
south of the country officially starts on Sept. 22. and will
take three years, Joseph Iita, permanent secretary in Namibia’s
Ministry of Water and Forestry, said in an e-mailed response to
questions today. Milan-based Salini Costruttori SpA, won the
building contract.  The southern African nation is in the grip of the worst
drought in at least three decades, compelling the government to
declare a state of emergency in May.  Neckartal will provide drinking water and irrigation for as
much as 5,000 hectares (12,355 acres) of crops, Iita said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
