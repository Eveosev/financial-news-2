Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ’s TD
Securities unit cut 10 jobs in its equities business in Toronto,
reflecting a slowdown in  stock trading .  “As a result of current market conditions and to achieve
synergies across functions, TD Securities made the difficult but
necessary decision to realign businesses within the equities
team,” Laurrell Mohammed, a spokesman for the Toronto-based
firm, said in a e-mail today. “The majority of those roles are
non-management.”  The cuts at Canada’s second-largest bank were earlier
reported in the Globe and Mail newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
