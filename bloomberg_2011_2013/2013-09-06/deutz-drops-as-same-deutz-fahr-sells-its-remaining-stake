Deutz AG (DEZ)  fell the most in more than
two years after SAME Deutz-Fahr sold its remaining 8.4 percent
stake in the German maker of  diesel engines  for about 70 million
euros ($92 million).  Deutz plunged as much as 11 percent to 6.56 euros, the
biggest intraday decline since August 8, 2011, and was trading
down 9.1 percent at 12:44 p.m. in  Frankfurt . Trading volume
exceeded the three-month daily average by 124 percent. The stock
has gained 89 percent this year, valuing the company at 810
million euros.  SAME Deutz-Fahr, the Treviglio, north Italy-based maker of
agriculture machines and tractors, completed the sale of the
stake at 6.88 euros a share, according to an e-mailed statement
today. Deutz will remain an important supplier and strategic
partner, SAME Deutz-Fahr said. The closely held Italian
manufacturer acquired the German company’s agricultural
machinery division in 1995.  “Maybe SAME wanted to focus on its core business of
tractors and agriculture machines,” Holger Schmidt, a Frankfurt
based analyst at Equinet AG said by phone today. “Their
strategy over the last few years was to reduce their stake, and
this is the completion.”  SAME Deutz-Fahr sold a stake of about 18 percent in Deutz
to Swedish truckmaker  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  in September 2012.  SAME Deutz-Fahr chose a “rather favorable” time to sell
as Deutz “seems fully priced” and has no further upside at the
moment, Schmidt said. He downgraded his rating on the shares to
hold from buy with a price estimate of 6.5 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
