Striking workers at Drummond Co. in
Colombia could return to the company’s coal mines and port as
soon as next week after workers voted to accept the firm’s pay
offer, according to two unions representing workers.  A majority of Drummond’s permanent employees in Colombia
voted in a Sept. 3-5 ballot to end a strike that has lasted more
than six weeks, Dionicio Machuca, president of the Agretritrenes
minority union, said by phone yesterday.  “If the documentation is presented in the labor ministry,
we could start work next week,” Machuca said. “As soon as
Monday.”  Drummond’s port and mine workers went on strike July 23,
halting output at Colombia’s No. 2 producer of coal, the
country’s main export after oil. Drummond produced 26 million
metric tons of coal in 2012, or about 29 percent of Colombia’s
total output, according to the country’s mining agency.  Alfredo Moreno, president of the minority union
Sintradrummond, also said a majority had voted to end the
strike. Cesar Flores, a negotiator for the majority
Sintramienergetica union, declined to comment on the vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
