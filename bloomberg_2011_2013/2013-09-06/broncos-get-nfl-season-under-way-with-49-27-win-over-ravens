The  Denver Broncos  scored 28 points
without reply in the second half as they beat the Super Bowl
champion Baltimore Ravens 49-27 in the opening game of the
National Football League regular season.  The start of the game at Sports Authority Field at Mile
High in Denver was delayed for 44 minutes by the threat of
lightning.  Baltimore scored on its second possession as quarterback
 Joe Flacco  found Vonta Leach from two yards to round out an 80-yard, 10-play drive.  Denver tied it three minutes, 20 seconds into the second
quarter when tight end Julius Thomas hauled in a 24-yard
touchdown pass from quarterback  Peyton Manning .  Wes Welker  muffed a punt catch to gift the Ravens
possession on Denver’s 1-yard line and Ray Rice converted the
error into seven points on the next play.  Manning then drove Denver 80 yards on six plays, connecting
with Thomas from 23 yards for a second touchdown to tie it
again.  After failing to breach Denver’s defense on three plays
from inside the Broncos 7-yard line, Baltimore took a 17-14 lead
on a 25-yard field goal by Justin Tucker with 10 seconds to play
in the second quarter.  Four unanswered touchdowns in the second half gave Denver
control at 42-17.  Andre Caldwell caught a 28-yard scoring pass 2:23 into the
third quarter. Two minutes later, after David Bruton blocked a
punt by Sam Koch to give Denver possession at Baltimore’s 10-yard line, Welker scored on a 5-yard pass. Manning linked with
Welker again from two yards for a score less than four minutes
later. The quarterback then found  Demaryius Thomas  with a 26-yard pass for a touchdown with 13:19 to play.  Missed Chance  Denver should have had a 32-point lead when Danny Trevathan
intercepted a pass by Flacco and ran into the end zone. However,
he dropped the ball before crossing the goal line, leading to a
touchback. Flacco then tossed a 13-yard pass to Marlon Brown for
a touchdown to make it 42-24.  Tucker added a field goal from 30 yards before Manning
became the sixth man in NFL history to toss seven touchdown
passes in a game. Manning threw a short pass to Demaryius
Thomas, who sprinted for a 78-yard score.  At the same venue on Jan. 12, the Ravens ended the Broncos’
11-game winning run to reach the American Football Conference
title game.  Denver led 35-28 until Flacco found Jacoby Jones with a 70-yard pass to tie the game with 31 seconds to play. The Ravens
won on a 47-yard field goal in double overtime and went on to
beat the  New England Patriots  before defeating the  San Francisco
49ers  in the  Super Bowl .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
