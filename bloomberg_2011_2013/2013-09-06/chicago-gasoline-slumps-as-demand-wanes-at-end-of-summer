Chicago  gasoline weakened to the
 smallest premium  versus futures in two weeks as demand dropped
with the end of the summer driving season.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline , or CBOB, slid 7 cents to
3 cents a gallon above futures on the New York Mercantile
Exchange at 12:48 p.m., the lowest level since Aug. 23. A
delivery cycle change this week helped pull the differential
lower over the past three days.  “The barrel into the new cycle is just a lot weaker,” Jim
Mosby, supply manager of ADMO Energy LLC, said by phone from
Kansas City, Missouri. “People don’t want to buy it.”  Nationwide demand  for gasoline rose 0.7 percent to 9.1
million barrels in the week ended Aug. 30 after dipping to a
five-week low a week earlier, according to Energy Information
Administration data. Consumption typically tapers off after the
Labor Day holiday weekend in early September when summer
vacations end and students return to school.  Stockpiles of gasoline  in the U.S. Midwest, known as PADD
2, fell 997,000 barrels to 46.8 million last week, the lowest
since Nov. 23, EIA data showed.  Distillate inventories  rose
511,000 barrels to 30.3 million.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel in  Chicago climbed  0.5 cent to
a discount of 1 cent against ULSD futures.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in the region, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate oil in Cushing,  Oklahoma , added 7 cents to $14.56 a
barrel, the first gain in four days, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
