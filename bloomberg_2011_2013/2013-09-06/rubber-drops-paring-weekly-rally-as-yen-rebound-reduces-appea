Rubber futures declined in  Tokyo  as
the Japanese currency rebounded against the dollar, reducing the
appeal of yen-based contracts, and as concern grew that the
Syrian conflict may harm the global economic recovery.  Rubber for delivery in February lost as much as 1 percent
to 280.8 yen a kilogram ($2,814 a metric ton) before trading at
282.1 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. Futures have gained
4.8 percent this week and touched 287.9 yen on Sept. 4, the
highest level since May.  The yen strengthened to 99.70 per dollar from the weakest
level since July 25 yesterday. Leaders of the Group of 20
nations at a summit in  Russia  grappled with threats to the
global economy as the effects of the Syrian conflict added to
the fallout from a potential stimulus exit.  “Futures came under pressure as the yen rebounded and
concerns grew that a U.S.-led attack on Syria could spark
further conflict in the Middle East,” said Takaki Shigemoto,
analyst at research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo.  Thai rubber free-on-board dropped 0.9 percent to 85.65 baht
($2.65) a kilogram yesterday, according to data from the Rubber
Research Institute of  Thailand . The contract for January
delivery fell 0.2 percent to 20,755  yuan  ($3,391) a ton on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
