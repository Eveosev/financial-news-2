Some safari lodges boast access to horses for an afternoon's outing, but a true African horseback safari unfolds over several days, with riders matched by ability to mounts, spending as many as five hours a day in the saddle, and possibly sleeping under the stars. Michael Lorenz, the CEO of  Passage to Africa  and a founding fellow of the new  Shackleton and Selous Society  of wilderness guides has led horseback safaris in Tanzania, Botswana's Okavango Delta, and other destinations. I have personally traveled with Michael (on foot in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and on elephant backs in the Okavango Delta) and recently asked for his tips about Africa options for horseback enthusiasts. SH: Can you get closer to wildlife on horseback than in a vehicle, and is it safe? ML:  "Riding among wildlife is a completely different experience from being on foot or in a vehicle. One can get very close to giraffe, zebra, and wildebeest, but it is essential that one has a good seat, since a horse may have to pivot or gallop to catch, keep up with, or get out of the way of animals. One wants to avoid getting too close to elephants, and obviously lion are to be avoided! A horseback safari is also more about experiencing beautiful and unusual habitats rather than taking photographs. In terms of regional differences, Kenya has more diverse scenery, and if chosen correctly more "big" wildlife. Botswana has the attraction of riding in the Okavango Delta, through water and with lots of elephants. The  Makgadigadi Pans  of the Kalahari Desert can be fabulous when the zebra migration is on. Namibia with its mix of ancient desert, mountain, and roadless plain offers otherworldly, extraordinary landscapes." SH: Which operator/guides do you recommend for advanced riders? ML:  "For the experienced rider, there are six great horseback safari operator-guides. In Botswana:  John Sobie  and  PJ Besterlink  are both situated in the Okavango Delta, while  David Foot  has 25 years' experience in the Makgadigadi Pans. In Kenya, I recommend  Gordy Church  and  Tristan Vorspuy . Sarah Jane Gullicks is a legendary pioneer of African horseback safaris. She started out in Botswana and now offers a choice of multi-day, long distance rides across  Namibia  for very advanced, fit, and adventurous riders." SH: What is the best option for a novice rider and why? ML:  "As a general rule, it is important to pick an operation that has many years experience, and riding that is more about scenery than wildlife.  Singita Grumeti Reserves  on the edge of Tanzania's Serengeti National Park has an outstanding stable set atop a dramatic plateau overlooking plains where wildebeest migrate in the spring. Alison Mundy, the riding manager, organizes half-day or full day trips suitable for novices. Singita Grumeti is also for the serious rider who wants luxurious lodgings and comforts. Other excellent options for novices are  Ride Kenya , a mobile safari traversing Amboseli and Chyulu Hills National Parks, and  Borana , a former cattle ranch now devoted to wildlife conservation on the edge of Laikipea Plateau, which has 26 horses, including some suited for children. The horses at all these operations are accustomed to the terrain and outstandingly well-schooled." Related: More From  Conde Nast Traveler :
