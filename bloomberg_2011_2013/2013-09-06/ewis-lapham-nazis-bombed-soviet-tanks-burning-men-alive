The fierce World War II battle of
Kursk, beginning July 5, 1943, marked the end of Nazi offensive
capacity on the Eastern Front.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  But it didn’t start out well for the Red Army as the
Luftwaffe pounded Russian tanks. Pilot Hans-Ulrich Rudel
described his first attack, “Four tanks exploded under the
hammer of my cannons; by the evening the total rises to 12.”  Extra fuel was carried on the rear deck, so a hit turned
the vehicle into a flaming torch. After the war, one veteran
wrote: “God forbid a living being from ever having to witness a
wounded, writhing person who is burning alive, or ever have to
experience the same.”  As a result, one unofficial badge of courage became the
number of times a soldier had been on fire inside a tank.  I spoke with Dennis Showalter, author of “Armor and Blood:
The Battle of Kursk,” on the following topics:  1. Nazis: Art of War.  2. Soviets: Science of War.  3. Regaining Momentum.  4. Role of Tanks.  5. Test of Will.  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
