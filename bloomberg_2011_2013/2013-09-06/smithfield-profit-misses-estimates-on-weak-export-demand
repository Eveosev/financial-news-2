Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD) , the U.S. pork
producer that China’s Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd. is
trying to buy for $4.7 billion, posted earnings that missed
analysts’ estimates after an increase in feed costs and lower
demand in some foreign markets.  Earnings dropped to 27 cents a share in the quarter ended
July 28 from 40 cents a year earlier, the Smithfield, Virginia-based company said today in a statement. That trailed the 47-cent average of five  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Fiscal
first-quarter sales rose 9.8 percent to $3.39 billion, beating
the $3.19 billion average of five estimates.  Higher hog-raising costs affected earnings in Eastern
Europe and  Mexico  while demand declined in Japan,  China  and
Russia, Chief Executive Officer C. Larry Pope said in the
statement.  “Normal seasonal weakness in fresh pork was exacerbated by
declines in key export markets,” Pope said.  Smithfield dropped 0.1 percent to $33.94 at 10:32 a.m. in
 New York . Hong Kong-based Shuanghui International announced its
$34-a-share cash offer on May 29. Smithfield shareholders will
vote on the takeover at a Sept. 24 meeting. The deal is subject
to a review from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the
U.S., or CFIUS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
