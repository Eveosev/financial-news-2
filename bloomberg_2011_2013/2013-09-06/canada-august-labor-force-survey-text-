Following is the text of  Canada ’s
labor force survey released by  Statistics Canada .  Employment increased by 59,000 in August, mainly in part-time work, and the unemployment rate declined 0.1 percentage
points to 7.1%. Over the six months to August, employment gains
averaged 12,000 per month, lower than the average of 29,000
observed during the preceding six-month period.  Since August 2012, employment has increased 1.4% (+246,000).
At the same time, the number of hours worked has grown 1.3%.  Provincially, employment increased in Ontario and  Alberta ,
while it declined in Manitoba.  Employment in health care and social assistance rose in
August, offsetting a decline in July. There were also more
people working in information, culture and recreation;
accommodation and food services; and in construction. At the
same time, there were fewer employed in educational services;
“other services”; finance, insurance, real estate and leasing;
and agriculture.  Employment gains were concentrated among people aged 55 and
over, while there was little change among youths and people aged
25 to 54.  The employment rate of returning students aged 15 to 24 was
up slightly this summer compared with last summer, but still low
compared with rates prior to the 2008/2009 labour market
downturn.  Employment up in Ontario and Alberta  In Ontario, employment increased by 44,000 in August,
mostly in part-time work, and the  unemployment rate  was 7.5%.
Compared with 12 months earlier, employment growth in the
province was 2.2%, higher than the national average of 1.4%.  In August, employment in Alberta rose by 15,000, the fourth
notable increase in five months. These recent gains have brought
year-over-year employment growth to 3.6%. As more people
searched for work in August, the unemployment rate rose 0.3
percentage points to 4.8%.  Employment in Manitoba declined for the second consecutive
month, down 3,100 in August. At the same time, the unemployment
rate decreased by 0.3 percentage points to 5.2% as fewer people
were looking for work. Compared with 12 months earlier,
employment in the province was little changed.  Despite little change in employment in  Quebec , the
unemployment rate declined 0.3 percentage points to 7.9% in
August as there were fewer people looking for work. On a year-over-year basis, employment was little changed, as gains in the
first five months of the period were offset by recent losses.  Industry perspective  In health care and social assistance, employment rose by
60,000 in August, more than offsetting the decline in July.
Employment in this industry has been on a long-term upward trend
and has increased by 2.5% since August 2012.  Employment increased by 33,000 in information, culture and
recreation in August, countering losses over the previous two
months. These gains brought employment to a level similar to
that of 12 months earlier.  In August, the number of people working in accommodation
and food services increased by 26,000. Employment rose by 3.9%
compared with 12 months earlier.  Employment in construction rose by 18,000 in August.
Following a recent low in August 2012, employment in this
industry has increased 9.1%.  Employment in educational services declined by 22,000 in
August and has fallen by 2.8% from 12 months earlier.  In August, employment in “other services” fell by 19,000,
contributing to a 12-month decline of 4.1% in this industry.  There were 19,000 fewer people working in finance,
insurance, real estate and leasing in August. Employment in this
industry has been relatively unchanged over the previous 12
months.  Agriculture employment was down by 11,000 in August,
bringing employment to the same level as 12 months earlier.  In August, there were 40,000 more people working as
employees, mainly within the private sector. Over the previous
12 months, the number of employees increased 1.5% in the private
sector, while it was little changed in the public sector. At the
same time, self-employment rose 3.6%, driven mostly by gains in
early 2013.  Employment gains among people aged 55 and over  In August, employment among people aged 55 and over rose by
52,000, with most of the gains among women. Compared with 12
months earlier, employment for men and women in this age group
increased by 146,000 (+4.5%), partly a result of population
aging.  Employment among youths aged 15 to 24 was little changed in
August, and the unemployment rate was 14.1%. Youth employment
has increased 1.7% since August 2012, mainly a result of gains
in the first half of the period.  Among people aged 25 to 54, employment was little changed
in August. Compared with 12 months earlier, employment for this
group was up 0.5% (+61,000), with the gains coming in 2012.  Student summer employment  From May to August, the Labour Force Survey collects labour
market data about young people aged 15 to 24 who were attending
school full time in March and who intend to return to school
full time in the fall. The published data are not seasonally
adjusted; therefore, comparisons can only be made on a year-over-year basis.  The average employment rate for May to August for students
aged 15 to 24 was 48.6%, up slightly from last summer (47.9%),
and the same as the rate in the summer of 2009 (48.6%), when
student employment was hard hit by the labour market downturn.
In contrast, the rates averaged 54.1% in the summers of 2006 to
2008.  The employment rate for students aged 15 and 16 declined to
24.4% this summer, the lowest rate since comparable data have
been available. On the other hand, employment rates rose for
students aged 17 to 19 and 20 to 24 compared with last summer.  The average unemployment rate over the summer for students
aged 20 to 24 was 11.2%, while it was 17.4% for those aged 17 to
19, and 28.8% for students aged 15 and 16.  The average number of hours worked at all jobs during the
summer of 2013 by students aged 15 to 24 was 23.7 hours per week,
down from 24.2 hours the previous summer. This was the first
decline in hours among these students since the summer of 2009.  Note to readers  The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. As a
result, monthly estimates will show more variability than trends
observed over longer time periods. Estimates for smaller
geographic areas or industries also have more variability. For
an explanation of sampling variability of estimates and how to
use standard errors to assess this variability, consult the
“Estimates quality” section of the publication Labour Force
Information (71-001-X).  The employment rate is the number of employed persons as a
percentage of the population 15 years of age and over. The rate
for a particular group (for example, youth aged 15 to 24) is the
number employed in that group as a percentage of the population
for that group.  The unemployment rate is the number unemployed as a
percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed).  The participation rate is the number of employed and
unemployed as a percentage of the population. For more detailed
information, see the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (71-543-G).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally
adjusted estimates, which facilitates comparisons by removing
the effects of seasonal variations. For more information on
seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal adjustment and identifying
economic trends ( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/colc-cel?catno=11-010-X201000311141&amp;lang=eng ) .  Each year, the LFS revises its estimates for the previous
three years, using the latest seasonal factors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
