Japanese  shares  fell, with the  Topix (TPX) 
index headed for its first decline this week, as developers and
other Olympics-related stocks retreated before a vote to select
the host of the 2020 Summer Games.  Topix gauges tracking real-estate and construction
companies, which would benefit from Tokyo being chosen, slipped.
Dentsu Inc., which has broadcast rights for the games in  Asia ,
sank 3.3 percent. SoftBank Corp. lost 1.8 percent as competitor
NTT DoCoMo Inc.,  Japan ’s No. 1 mobile-phone carrier, was said to
be near an agreement to sell Apple Inc.’s iPhone.  The Topix slid 0.7 percent to 1,149.35 as of 12:47 p.m. in
Tokyo, reversing an earlier gain of as much as 0.4 percent. All
but three of its 33 industry groups declined. The measure is
headed for its first weekly advance in three weeks after rising
for the past four days. The  Nikkei 225  fell 1.1 percent to
13,914.91. Investors awaited a monthly U.S. jobs report today
and the Olympics host announcement tomorrow.  “If Japan loses its bid for the Olympics, then stocks for
which a sure win had been priced in are likely to reverse
gains,” said Masahiro Ayukai, a senior strategist at Mitsubishi
UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. “Also, if the U.S. jobs
report today misses expectations, it’s going to lead to a cheap-stocks, strong-yen scenario. Investors don’t want to be keeping
hold of their positions ahead of such big events. Sentiment is
leaning toward taking profits.”  Madrid’s bid to host the games has the support of 50 out of
98 members of the  International Olympic Committee , Spanish
newspaper El Mundo reported yesterday.  U.S. Employment  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.1 percent
today. The measure climbed 0.1 percent in  New York  yesterday as
data showed fewer Americans than forecast filed for  unemployment
benefits  last week, companies boosted payrolls in August by
176,000 workers, and an index of non-manufacturing industries
expanded at the fast pace in almost eight years.  The Labor Department’s monthly jobs report, which will be
watched for signs of when the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  will reduce stimulus, is likely to show U.S.
payrolls rose by 180,000 in August, while the jobless rate will
remain at 7.4 percent, a Bloomberg poll of economists showed.  The Fed will probably decide to cut its $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases this month, according to 65 percent of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg on Aug. 9-13. The  Federal Open
Market Committee  holds a two-day gathering on Sept. 17-18.  “The US report is key for Bernanke and the Fed with regard
to the tapering decision,” said Stuart Beavis, head of
institutional equity derivatives at Vantage Capital Markets in
 Hong Kong . “Markets have been up every day this week -- there
is profit-taking for sure.”  Kyokuyo Tumbles  Kyokuyo Co., a seafood distributor, sank 3.7 percent to 261
yen as  South Korea  said it would ban imports of all fishery
products from the waters around the Fukushima nuclear plant amid
radiation concerns.  Among stocks that rose, Suntory Beverage & Food Ltd. gained
1.5 percent to 3,505 yen after three people familiar with
discussions said the soft-drinks maker is in talks to buy the
Lucozade and Ribena brands from drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc.  The Topix traded at 1.21 times  book value  yesterday,
compared with 2.43 for the S&P 500 and 1.72 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index yesterday. The Japanese measure’s 30-day historic
volatility was at 28.80 yesterday, compared with its five-year
median of 19.42.  To contact the reporters on this story:
