Canada hired a broker to sell its
diplomatic premises in London’s Mayfair district to combine its
ambassadorial properties in the U.K. capital and take advantage
of booming demand for luxury homes and hotels.  The Canadian High Commission will sell the site and
consolidate its diplomatic work in the U.K. at Canada House on
 Trafalgar Square , broker  Savills Plc (SVS)  said today in an e-mailed
statement. The property on Grosvenor Square is valued at about
250 million pounds ($390 million), according to a person with
knowledge of the sale process who asked not to be identified
because the information isn’t public.  “We expect interest from all over the world, with both the
hotel and residential sectors vying for this prime Mayfair
destination,” Tim Whitmey, a director at London-based Savills,
said in the statement.  The Canadians are following the Greek, Dutch and U.S.
governments, which have all offered diplomatic sites in west
London for sale. The U.S. government is relocation its embassy
to south London from Grosvenor Square. The Canadian High
Commission building at 1 Grosvenor Square was the U.S. Embassy
in  London  from 1938 to 1960.  Luxury-home values in neighborhoods such as Mayfair,
Knightsbridge and Chelsea will climb 6 percent in 2013, fueled
by demand from overseas investors and a weakened pound, Jones
Lang LaSalle Inc. said on Aug. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
