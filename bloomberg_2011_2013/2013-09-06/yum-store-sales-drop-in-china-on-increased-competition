Yum! Brands Inc., (YUM)  owner of the KFC
and Pizza Hut chains, posted August same-store sales in China
that trailed analysts’ estimates as rival restaurants lured
diners and a poultry quality issue kept customers away.  Sales at stores open at least 12 months fell 10 percent
last month in China, an improvement from a 13 percent drop in
July, the Louisville, Kentucky-based company said in a filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Analysts
estimated a 7.7 percent drop, according to the average of eight
projections from Consensus Metrix.  Yum, which gets about three-quarters of its  revenue  from
outside the U.S., is seeing more competition from expanding
local restaurants including Dicos and Hua Lai Shi in  China . The
company’s KFC stores also have faced a customer backlash in
China after a former chicken supplier was investigated for
selling food with too much antibiotics and an outbreak of avian
flu scared diners away.  “It has gotten more competitive there, especially in some
of the more popular first and second-tier cities,” Jack P. Russo, a St. Louis-based analyst at Edward Jones & Co. who
advises holding the shares, said in an interview.  Also, there is still some negative “overhang” from the
poultry supply issue, he said.  Yum has fallen 3.2 percent since the end of March, around
the peak of the avian flu, compared with a 4.4 percent increase
for the  Standard & Poor’s  500 Restaurants Index.  Same-store sales fell 10 percent in June in the Asian
nation, where the company has been advertising the quality of
its chicken to attract customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
