SABMiller Plc, (SAB)  the world’s second-biggest brewer, said Graham Mackay resumed his role as non-executive chairman after treatment for a brain tumor.  Mackay returned to the position yesterday after being off
work since May, the London-based company said today. John Manser, who had been acting chairman, will return to his former
role as deputy chairman and senior independent director.  “The directors are extremely grateful to John Manser for
stepping so ably into the breach as acting chairman during my
absence, and I personally have relied hugely on his support and
wise counsel during what has been a very difficult few months
for my family and me,” Mackay said in a statement.  In April, Mackay stepped down early as the brewer’s chief
executive officer after undergoing brain surgery. As CEO, he led
a slew of acquisitions, including the A$10.5 billion ($9.6
billion) takeover of Foster’s Group Ltd. in 2011. SABMiller
generated $23.2 billion in revenue last year and competes with
the world’s biggest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, as well as
Heineken NV and Carlsberg A/S.  Alan Clark, a company veteran of more than two decades,
replaced Mackay as CEO.  “I am delighted that the transition of the chief
executive’s management responsibilities to Alan Clark has gone
so well,” Mackay said in today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
