Banco Santander Chile (BSAN)  extended its
weekly rally to the biggest since December 2011 after Bank of
America Corp. projected that  Chile ’s second-largest lender will
benefit from accelerating consumer prices.  The shares climbed 4.7 percent to 31.30 pesos at 12:03 p.m.
in Santiago and are up 9.7 percent this week. The IPSA benchmark
index rose 1.7 percent today.  Bank of America raised its recommendation to buy from the
equivalent of sell after “strong” results in July and amid a
projection that faster inflation will boost the lender’s profit.
Chilean banks typically hold inflation-indexed instruments to
benefit from rises in consumer prices.  The results “point to a rebound in earnings and
profitability” for the second half of the year, Bank of America
analysts Jose Barria and Jorg Friedemann said in an e-mailed
research note to clients.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. reiterated in a research note an
“overweight” rating for Santander Chile and said it remains
the top pick for lenders in the region outside  Brazil .  Bank of America also raised  Banco de Chile , the country’s
largest lender, to a buy.  Banco de Chile (CHILE) ’s shares rose 0.8
percent to 74.40 pesos today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
