Treasury 10-year notes rose after
declines this week that pushed the securities to the cheapest in
two years made them attractive to buyers.  The  yield  on the benchmark security for everything from
corporate to  mortgage loans  breached 3 percent earlier today for
the first time since July 2011 amid concern the  Federal Reserve 
will pare its bond-buying stimulus program as soon as this
month. A payrolls report today may influence policy makers’
decision after data yesterday showed companies increased hiring
by less than economists had predicted. The Fed said in its  Beige
Book  two days ago that the recovery is “modest to moderate.”  “The recent selloff was very rapid and this may call for
some consolidation,” said  Patrick Jacq , a senior rates
strategist at BNP Paribas SA in Paris. “If data are not strong
then there will probably be a pause in the selloff, and
potentially a limited recovery.”  Benchmark 10-year yields fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.96 percent at 7:13 a.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. Today’s high was 3.005
percent. The 2.5 percent note due in August 2023 rose 10/32, or
$3.13 per $1,000 face amount, to 96 2/32.  The yield has climbed from 2013’s low of 1.61 percent on
May 1 as signs the economy is stabilizing raised the prospect of
the Fed curbing its $85 billion a month of bond purchases.  Term Premium  The 10-year  term premium  signaled that the securities are
the cheapest since 2011. The model, which includes expectations
for  interest rates , growth and inflation, was at 0.61 percent
today, from 0.63 percent yesterday, the most since May 10, 2011.  It was negative as recently as June 18. The 10-year average
is 0.23 percent. A positive reading indicates that investors are
getting yields that are above what is considered fair value.  The 14-day  relative strength index  for the 10-year yield
climbed to 70 yesterday, the level that some traders see as a
sign a security has moved too fast and is poised to reverse
course. The benchmark 10-year rate surpassed analysts’ year-end
weighted average forecast of 2.79 percent.  “We’ve had quite a dramatic selloff,” said Roger Bridges,
who helps oversee the equivalent of about $21.3 billion as the
head of fixed income in Sydney at Tyndall Investment Management
Ltd., a unit of  Japan ’s Nikko Asset Management Co. “When you
start talking about 3 percent for the 10-year bond, people might
start reassessing.”  Jobs Data  A Labor Department report today will show companies added
180,000 workers in August, and the  unemployment rate  stayed at
the lowest since 2008, according to Bloomberg News surveys of
analysts. Payrolls gained by 162,000 in July.  Companies boosted employment by 176,000 workers in August
from a 198,000 gain in July, according to figures from the
Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Research Institute yesterday. The
median of 43 economists’ prediction in a Bloomberg survey was
for a gain of 184,000.  Fed officials are debating whether the expansion and job
market have improved enough to warrant trimming monthly bond
purchases. The Fed is buying $45 billion of Treasuries and $40
billion in mortgage bonds each month in its quantitative-easing
program to support the economy by putting downward pressure on
borrowing costs. A Bloomberg News survey of economists taken
Aug. 9-13 showed that 65 percent of them expected a reduction
when U.S. central bank officials next meet on Sept. 17-18.  Treasuries have declined 4.3 percent this year, compared
with a 2.2 percent gain in 2012, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
