Poland’s government approved the
2014 draft budget, which envisages the deficit narrowing after a
revamp of the country’s privately managed pension funds.  The gap will drop to 47.7 billion zloty ($14.7 billion)
from 51.6 billion zloty estimated for this year, the government
said today after a two-day meeting. Revenue will reach 276.5
billion zloty, while spending will be 324.2 billion zloty, it
said.  Poland will take over and cancel state debt held by pension
funds and make future contributions “voluntary,” Prime
Minister Donald Tusk said this week. The government, which
trails in polls before 2015 elections, wants to spur recovery in
the European Union’s largest eastern economy with this year’s
growth forecast at the weakest pace since at least 1997.  “It’s a cautious budget,” Tusk told reporters in Warsaw
today. “Hence we will avoid any negative surprises and maintain
our reputation with financial markets.”  The economic slowdown forced the government last month to
widen the this year’s budget shortfall by 45 percent to 51.6
billion zloty and suspend limits on increases in public debt, a
move Fitch Ratings said “reduced fiscal credibility.” Next
year’s draft budget assumes economic growth will recover to 2.5
percent from 1.5 percent projected for 2013.  To trim public debt and allow higher spending, the
government said this week that it will assume control of 51.5
percent of pension-fund assets, including bonds, stopping short
of fully nationalizing the system.  Borrowing Costs  The revamp will allow government to lower borrowing costs
and reduce subsidies for state’s social security system next
year, Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski said today. The estimated
total savings will amount to about 9 billion zloty, including
4.8 billion zloty in lower debt costs and a reduction in social-security subsidies of about 4.5 billion zloty, according to
Finance Ministry Chief Economist  Ludwik Kotecki .  The changes, which are due to take effect in mid-2014, will
reduce the ratio of public debt to economic output by 0.5
percentage point, Kotecki said yesterday at an earlier briefing.  The social-security system will also gradually absorb
pension-fund assets for people due to retire in the 10 years
prior to reaching the official pension age. That will amount to
4.4 billion zloty in 2014 and 2.3 billion zloty in 2015, Deputy
Finance Minister Wojciech Kowalczyk said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
