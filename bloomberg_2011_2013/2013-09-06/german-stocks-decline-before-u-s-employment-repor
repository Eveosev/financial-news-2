German stocks  advanced, extending a
weekly gain, as investors assessed whether the  Federal Reserve 
will taper its bond purchases after a report showed U.S.
payrolls climbed less than economists had projected.  RWE AG (RWE)  jumped 6.4 percent, leading a gauge of utilities
higher.  Deutz AG (DEZ)  plunged the most in more than two years after
an investor sold a 8.4 percent stake in the manufacturer of
diesel engines.  ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (PSM)  dropped 1.1 percent
after Telegraaf Media Groep NV sold its stake in the company.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  climbed 0.5 percent to 8,275.67 at the close
of trading in Frankfurt. The equity benchmark gained 2.1 percent
this week as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi 
reiterated that interest rates will stay low for an extended
period. The broader HDAX Index increased 0.4 percent today.  “Tapering is less likely now -- at least in September --
after the payroll data,”  Robert Halver , head of capital-markets
research at Baader Bank AG in Frankfurt, said in a telephone
interview. “Liquidity is still the main driving factor in the
equity markets. Cash liquidity is still king.”  Payrolls in the U.S. climbed in August less than projected.
Employers hired a net 169,000 workers last month, fewer than the
median forecast of 180,000 in a Bloomberg survey.  German  exports , adjusted for working days and seasonal
changes, fell 1.1 percent in July, the Federal Statistics Office
in Wiesbaden said today. Economists had predicted an increase of
0.7 percent, according to the median of 13 estimates in a
 Bloomberg News survey . Imports rose 0.5 percent.  Industrial Production  A separate report showed that  industrial production  in
Europe’s largest economy dropped 1.7 percent in July. Economists
had predicted a decline of 0.5 percent, according to the median
of 41 estimates in a  Bloomberg News survey . The measure of
output from utilities, mines and factories jumped a revised 2
percent in June.  The DAX earlier dropped as much as 0.7 percent after
 Vladimir Putin  said Russia will help Syria if the U.S. takes
military action against the regime of Bashar al-Assad.  RWE, Germany’s second biggest utility, rallied 6.4 percent
to 23.28 euros.  Deutz AG tumbled 9.3 percent to 6.68 euros after Same
Deutz-Fahr Group SpA sold more than 10 million shares in the
manufacturer for 70 million euros ($92 million).  ProSiebenSat.1 Media  dropped 1.1 percent to 30.78 euros
after Telegraaf Media sold a 6 percent stake in the broadcaster
for 30 euros per share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
