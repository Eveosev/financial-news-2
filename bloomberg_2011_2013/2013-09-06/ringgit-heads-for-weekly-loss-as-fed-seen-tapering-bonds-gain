Malaysia ’s ringgit plunged this week
after the  trade surplus  fell to the lowest since April and on
prospects the  Federal Reserve  will soon trim monetary stimulus
that’s driven demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency extended losses today after a report showed
imports surged more than exports in July, narrowing the trade
balance to $2.86 billion versus $4.32 billion a month earlier.
The figures add to concern the surplus in the current account,
the broadest measure of trade, will shrink from a record low at
a time when the ringgit is Southeast Asia’s second-worst
performing currency after Indonesia’s rupiah this quarter.  “Worries that the current-account surplus will narrow
further are adding pressure to the ringgit,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in
Singapore. “That’s not helping in an environment where there
are prospects of potential tapering by the Fed.”  The currency dropped 0.6 percent to 3.3281 per dollar as of
2:21 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, taking losses this week to 1.3
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It reached a three-year low of 3.3377 on Aug. 28 and is down 5 percent this quarter.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose 76 basis points,
or 0.76 percentage point, to 9.84 percent this week.  Subsidy Cuts  Prime Minister Najib Razak announced fuel price increases
on Sept. 2 for the first time since 2010 to curb subsidies that
have strained the government budget, after  Fitch Ratings  cut its
outlook on the nation’s A- credit rating to negative from stable
on July 30. Fitch cited rising debt levels and a lack of
budgetary reform for its decision and said Malaysia risks a
downgrade in 18-24 months unless it improves the fiscal position.  The effort to rein in subsidies helped fuel a rally in the
 bond market . The yield on the 3.48 percent government notes
maturing March 2023 fell 13 basis points to 3.96 percent this
week after rising over the previous 10 days, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Malaysia’s imports climbed 6.2 percent from a year earlier
in July, compared with a 1.3 percent increase in June, the
official data showed, beating the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey for a 0.2 percent contraction. Overseas shipments rose
4.5 percent, after falling 6.9 percent a month earlier.  The current-account surplus shrank 70 percent last quarter
to 2.6 billion ringgit ($781 million). Malaysia also reports
foreign-exchange  reserves  today. Holdings were $137.9 billion as
of Aug. 15, down from $141.4 billion in May, the highest level
in data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1998.  U.S. data later today may bolster the case for the Fed to
cut stimulus. Non-farm payrolls climbed 180,000 in August, after
increasing 162,000 in July, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The  Federal Open Market
Committee  meets Sept. 17-18 to discuss its debt-purchase program.  “Bets on Fed tapering are the main play right now,” said
Zulkiflee Nidzam, head of foreign-exchange trading at Asian
Finance Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur .  To contact the reporter on this story:
