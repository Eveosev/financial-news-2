Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-bank lending  rate , is projected to open at 0.09 percent to 0.11
percent, within the  Federal Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25
percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.03 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.03 percent to 0.25 percent and averaging 0.07 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-mailed statement.  No temporary open market operations, which add or drain
 reserves  to the banking system, are expected. The Fed has no
Treasury purchases scheduled for today, which are permanent open
market operations.  In repos, the Fed buys  U.S. Treasury , mortgage-backed and
agency debt from its primary dealers for a set period,
temporarily raising the amount of money available in the banking
system. At maturity, the securities are returned to the dealers,
and the cash to the Fed. In reverse repos, temporary funds are
drained from the system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
