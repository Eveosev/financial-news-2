Buyers of coffee from  Vietnam , the
world’s largest producer of the robusta variety used in instant
drinks, are paying a higher premium for their beans amid low
supplies from farmers, according to Volcafe Ltd.  Vietnamese beans for shipment this month and the next are
at a premium of $130 a metric ton to the price on the NYSE Liffe
exchange in  London , the Winterthur, Switzerland-based coffee
unit of commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd. said in a
report e-mailed today. That’s up from $120 a ton last week.  The “local market unexpectedly tightened due to very thin
physical supply from farmers,” Volcafe said. The “farmgate
price continues to trade at par or at premium to Liffe and
farmers hold back if the price is lower than 39,000 dong ($1.85)
a kilogram (2.2 pounds), consequently exporters also hold back
offers.”  Vietnam will produce a record 30 million bags of coffee,
each weighing 60 kilograms, in the 2013-14 season that starts in
October, the trader estimates. That’s up from 26 million bags in
the season ending this month. Robusta coffee futures fell 5
percent in London last month. Stockpiles in  Ho Chi Minh City 
fell 700,000 bags to 1.9 million bags, according to the report.  The “main focus is on the new crop, with buyers expecting
prices to weaken in the next months as the harvest slowly gets
under way,” Volcafe said. “Warehouses are being emptied.”  In  Indonesia , the world’s third-biggest robusta grower,
bean deliveries from farms amounted to about 23,000 tons this
week, the trader said. That’s down from 24,000 tons last week.  Local prices were 19,400 rupiah ($1.68) to 20,600 rupiah a
kilogram compared with 19,500 rupiah to 20,300 rupiah a kilogram
last week, Volcafe data showed. Beans for shipment this month
and the next were at a premium of $130 a ton to the exchange
price, unchanged from last week.  In  India ,  Asia ’s third-biggest coffee grower, supplies have
“slowed down” and the local market is bidding at higher
prices, according to the report.  Robusta coffee for delivery in November was 0.5 percent
higher at $1,769 a ton by 12:38 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
