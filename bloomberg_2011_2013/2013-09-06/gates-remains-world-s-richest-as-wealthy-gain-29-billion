The world’s 200 wealthiest people
added $29.4 billion to their collective net worth this week as
slower-than-forecast growth in jobs eased investor concern about
cuts to Federal Reserve stimulus.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  co-founder  Bill Gates , 57, remains the
richest person in the world. Shares of the world’s largest
software maker fell 6.7 percent this week after the company
announced a $7.2 billion takeover of  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) ’s handset
business. Gates’s fortune has risen $8.2 billion this year to
$71 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  “Investors are questioning the need to buy the device
portion of Nokia and how that contributes to synergy with
Microsoft’s existing business and exactly what the strategy
is,” Walter “Bucky” Hellwig, who helps manage $17 billion at
BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama, said by phone.
“Investors, they voted and they voted against it. It took the
stock down pretty aggressively on the announcement.”  The Redmond, Washington-based company has lost more than
$18 billion in market value since the purchase of Nokia’s
mobile-phone assets was disclosed, erasing all of the gains that
followed the announcement last month that  Steve Ballmer , its
chief executive officer, will retire within a year.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1.4 percent during the
week to close at 1655.17. The MSCI World Index gained 2 percent.  Slim, Buffett  Payrolls in the U.S. climbed less than projected in August
and gains for the prior two months were revised down, pointing
to an expansion that’s struggling to gain momentum. The addition
of 169,000 workers last month trailed the 180,000 median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 96 economists. Unemployment
fell to 7.3 percent, the lowest since December 2008, as workers
left the  labor force .  Ballmer’s fortune jumped more than $900 million after
announcing his retirement from the world’s largest software
maker Aug. 23. The 57-year-old, who is No. 48 on the Bloomberg
ranking, is the company’s largest individual shareholder after
Gates. He has a net worth of $15.6 billion.  Mexico’s  Carlos Slim  is $6.7 billion behind Gates. The 73-year-old telecommunications tycoon’s fortune has fallen $10.9
billion this year as his main holding, a 44 percent stake in
America Movil SAB, the largest mobile-phone operator in the
Americas, has fallen 14.5 percent.  No. 3 on the Bloomberg ranking is  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) 
chairman  Warren Buffett . Shares of the Omaha, Nebraska-based
company are up 25 percent this year, elevating the 83-year-old’s
fortune to $57.2 billion.  The Bloomberg Billionaires Index takes measure of the
world’s wealthiest people based on market and economic changes
and Bloomberg News reporting. Each net worth figure is updated
