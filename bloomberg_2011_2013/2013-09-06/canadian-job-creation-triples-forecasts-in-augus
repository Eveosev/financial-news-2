Canadian  employment  rose faster than
economists forecast in August, gaining for the first time in
three months led by part-time work and service industries.  Employment increased by 59,200 and the  jobless rate  fell to
7.1 percent from 7.2 percent,  Statistics Canada  said today in
Ottawa. Economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  projected a 20,000
job increase and an unchanged jobless rate, according to the
median forecasts.  Canada ’s dollar jumped as the gain contrasted with a U.S.
report that showed payrolls rose by less than was forecast. Even
with the jobs increase, Canada’s labor market remains on pace
for the slowest advance in employment since 2001 outside of the
last recession.  “I don’t think this is a signal there is a lot of positive
momentum for the Canadian economy,” Sonya Gulati, senior
economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said of the jobs report.
“The employment growth that we are getting just isn’t
consistent enough to make some headway in lowering the
 unemployment rate .”  The U.S. reported today its jobless rate fell to 7.3
percent last month as people dropped out of the labor force and
payrolls expanded by a less-than-expected 169,000.  The Canadian dollar rose 1.1 percent to C$1.0388 per  U.S.
dollar  at 11:55 a.m. in Toronto. One dollar buys 96.26 U.S.
cents.  Government bonds  rose, with the yield on the benchmark
five-year note falling by 5 basis points to 2.11 percent.  Part-time Gains  Part-time employment in Canada rose by 41,800 in August,
with full-time jobs rising by 17,400, Statistics Canada said.
Service industry employment increased by 40,600 and goods-producing companies hired 18,600.  Canada has added 38,400 full-time jobs so far this year,
the second-least in that period since 1995.  Health care and social assistance employment rose by 59,500
in August, followed by a 33,200 gain for information, culture
and recreation workers. Accommodation and food service
employment advanced 25,500 and construction climbed 17,700,
according to the report.  The job surge follows an Aug. 30 report that showed
economic growth slowed to a 1.7 percent annualized pace in the
second quarter. The  Bank of Canada  kept its  policy rate  at 1
percent on Sept. 4, where it’s been for three years.  Slowing Average  Job gains have averaged 12,700 this year, compared with
25,900 in 2012. The world’s 11th largest economy needs to add
more than 22,000 jobs a month for the rest of 2013 to avoid
suffering the weakest annual gain since 2001, except for the
recession years of 2008-2009.  “What’s perhaps more important for the market today is the
very marked divergence with the U.S.,” said  Doug Porter , chief
economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. “While you can
punch some holes in the Canadian report, it’s still impressive
overall.”  Unemployment has stayed between 7 percent and 7.5 percent
since May 2011, after it dropped from a peak of 8.7 percent in
August 2009. The jobless rate will average 7 percent or more
through the first quarter of next year, according to a Bloomberg
economist forecast.  Education workers fell by 22,400 to lead declining
industries in August. The finance, insurance, real estate and
leasing group cut 18,500 jobs and public administration work
fell by 6,700 positions, Statistics Canada said.  Private companies added 30,900 workers in August, and
public-sector employment advanced 9,000. Workers designated by
Statistics Canada as employees rose by 39,900. The self-employed
category increased by 19,200.  Wage Growth  The figures “confirm a tendency that has been ongoing for
some time and that has been the steady growth of jobs in
Canada,” Prime Minister Stephen Harper said at a press
conference today shown on CTV News at a meeting of leaders from
the Group of 20 nations in  St. Petersburg ,  Russia .  Average hourly  wages  of permanent employees rose 1.55
percent in August from a year earlier, exceeding the prior
reading of 1.35 percent.  In a separate report, Statistics Canada today said that the
nation’s labor  productivity  rose 0.5 percent in the second
quarter. From a year earlier, productivity rose 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
