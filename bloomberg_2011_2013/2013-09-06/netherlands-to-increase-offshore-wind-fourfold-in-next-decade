The Netherlands plans to boost
offshore wind farms fourfold and curb energy use as it seeks to
revive a faltering economy and secure future power supplies.  The nation plans to increase to 4,450 megawatts wind farms
at sea by 2023 from about 1,000 megawatts installed or under
development currently, the government said in documents on its
website. It will also add onshore wind as it seeks to get 16
percent of its energy from renewables by the same year from 4
percent now, it said.  The plans are part of an energy accord to be signed today
that’s the culmination of negotiations between government,
industry and lobby groups. The agreement is meant to create
jobs, lure investors to build  power plants  and meet demand while
reducing emissions by as much as 95 percent in 2050.  “This sets the Netherlands up as the world’s newest
offshore wind market, after previous governments had turned away
from it because of cost,” Nico Tyabji, a London-based analyst
at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said today. The agreement will
also help it meet a separate European Union target of getting 14
percent of energy from renewables by 2020, after it lagged
behind other nations with EU goals, he said.  The agreement, which has 10 strands, also seeks to curb
energy use by about 1.5 percent a year. It will focus on savings
at buildings, including a 600 million-euro ($788 million)
national energy-saving fund, as well as reducing use from
industry, agriculture and other business. The accord will create
more than 15,000 full-time jobs, the government said.  Cheaper Technology  The nation, which had scaled-back offshore wind plans for
being too expensive, now proposes to add 3,450 megawatts through
cost reductions to the technology of about 40 percent, the
government said. It also plans to reach 6,000 megawatts of
onshore wind by 2020.  The Netherlands will limit burning of biomass because of
sustainability of the resource. It will also reduce coal plants,
with three closures in 2016 and two the year after. Gas will
remain important in the energy mix, it said.  The government will develop  carbon capture  and storage
technology, which traps emissions from power stations and
factories. The accord also seeks to reduce transport emissions
by 60 percent by 2050 compared with 1990 levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
