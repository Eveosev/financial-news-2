Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s
largest lender, is undertaking a review of its wealth-management
business in  Brazil .  “We continuously evaluate options and opportunities to
improve our business and enhance client service and over the
coming months we are undertaking a strategic review of our
Brazilian operations,” Aishling Cullen, a spokeswoman for the
Toronto-based bank, said today in an e-mailed statement.  Royal Bank, which has a wealth-management office in Sao
Paolo, said in August it was closing an office with about 40
employees in Montevideo, Uruguay, at the end of October as part
of its strategic review of its Latin American business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
