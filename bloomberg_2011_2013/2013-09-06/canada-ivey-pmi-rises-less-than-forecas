Canada’s purchasing managers boosted
spending in August by less than economists forecast, according
to a  gauge  released today by Western University’s business
school.  The Ivey Purchasing Managers Index rose to 51.0 in August
on a seasonally adjusted basis, following a July reading of
48.4, according to a statement on the  London , Ontario
university’s website. Readings of more than 50 indicate
purchasing by governments and companies increased.  Economists projected a reading of 53.0, according to the
median of a Bloomberg survey with nine responses.  Canada’s economy slowed to a 1.7 percent annualized growth
pace in the second quarter. Businesses reluctant to spend and
weak exports have hampered the expansion of the world’s 11th
largest economy this year even as its Group of Seven peers show
signs of improvement.  The Ivey Employment Index dropped to 43.6 in August, the
lowest  level  since April 2009, while a gauge of inventories fell
to 48.7 from 53.3 in July, according to the release.  A gauge of prices rose to 60.9 last month from 52.8 in
July. The supplier deliveries  index (IVEYSA)  rose to 45.6 in July from
38.9 the month before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
