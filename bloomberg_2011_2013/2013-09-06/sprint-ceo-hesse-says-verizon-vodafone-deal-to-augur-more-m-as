Sprint Corp. (S)  Chief Executive Officer
 Dan Hesse  said the U.S. telecommunications industry is bracing
for more deals after  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) ’s $130 billion
buyout of its venture with  Vodafone Group Plc. (VOD)   “More consolidation in the industry is inevitable as phone
carriers need more capacity to continue to invest and improve
services,” Hesse said in an interview at the IFA consumer-electronics conference in Berlin today. “That’s also been
reflected in what we’ve seen with Vodafone and Verizon. We
should see more deals in the coming future.”  Sprint, the third-largest U.S. wireless company, sold a
controlling stake to Tokyo-based SoftBank Corp. in July for
$21.6 billion. When asked about possible international expansion
after that transaction, Hesse said at the conference: “We have
the financial resources to consider it. It’s possible.”  The sale to SoftBank included a $5 billion cash infusion to
give  Overland Park , Kansas-based Sprint the flexibility to
bolster its network or pursue its own acquisitions. SoftBank’s
president, billionaire Masayoshi Son, has said he plans to make
SoftBank one of the biggest carriers globally.  Sprint was little changed at $6.47 at the close in New
York. The company this week raised $6.5 billion in a bond sale,
the biggest high-yield offering since 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
