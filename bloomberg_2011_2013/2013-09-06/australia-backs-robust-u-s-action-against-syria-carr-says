Australia  supports President Barrack Obama’s call for air strikes against Syria if the United Nations
Security Council fails to act, Foreign Minister Bob Carr said at
a Group of 20 summit in St. Petersburg,  Russia .  “Australia supports a robust U.S. response” to halt the
use of chemical weapons in Syria, Carr said in an e-mail sent by
his spokesman, Patrick Low.  Obama, who blames Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for a
chemical attack that killed more than 1,400 people near
Damascus, is seeking support for military action at the G-20
summit even though Russia,  China  and most of the other members
of the group are opposed.  Australia doesn’t plan to contribute militarily to a strike
because Obama plans a “quick response and ruled out boots on
the ground,” Carr said in an interview earlier today.  Carr’s ruling Labor party may not be in power much longer.
Australia holds a general election tomorrow that opposition
leader Tony Abbott’s Liberal-National coalition will probably
win, according to a Newspoll published in the Australian
newspaper on Sept. 2.  “If  Syria  appears to abuse chemical weapons without a
response, that would convey a message that chemical-weapon use
is an option for dictatorships,” Carr said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
