The combined carrying capacity of
oil tankers calling at Saudi Arabia’s Ras Tanura rose 19 percent
in the week ended Aug. 31, vessel-tracking data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The implied capacity of vessels calling at the world’s
largest crude-export complex gained to the equivalent of 9.27
million barrels a day from 7.79 million barrels for the prior
week, according to signals gathered by IHS Fairplay, a Coulsdon,
England-based maritime research company. The data may be
incomplete because not all transmissions are captured.  The Ras Tanura complex, including Ras al-Ju’aymah, is the
biggest global crude terminal, according to the website of Saudi
Arabian Oil Co., known as Saudi Aramco. Tankers hauling crude
from the Persian Gulf may call at other loading ports before or
after Ras Tanura, indicating they might have collected partial
cargoes elsewhere.  The table below lists the destination countries of tankers
calling at Ras Tanura in the latest week as of about 9 a.m.
London time today. The percentages represent the share of the
total number of ships loading at the terminal that each country
is due to receive.  Very large crude carriers are assumed to carry 2 million
barrels apiece, twice as much as Suezmax tankers. The tally
excludes vessels smaller than Aframaxes, each holding about
650,000 barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
