Copper futures rose on speculation
that the  Federal Reserve  will hold off on scaling back monetary
stimulus after U.S. companies added fewer jobs in August than
analysts expected.  Payrolls climbed by 169,000 workers, trailing the 180,000
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey, and the
July figure at 104,000 was smaller than the government
estimated, Labor Department statistics showed today. The Fed is
monitoring jobs as part of its evaluation on maintaining bonds
purchases in U.S., the world’s second-biggest copper consumer.  “All of the metals are going through a knee-jerk reaction
to the idea that the prospect of tapering is receding,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “Expectations for
immediate tapering have gotten a little bit dented by the jobs
report for now.”  Copper futures for December delivery rose 0.5 percent to
settle at $3.2615 a pound at 1:26 p.m. on the Comex in  New York ,
capping the first weekly gain since Aug. 16. The metal has
dropped 11 percent this year.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose 0.7 percent to $7,160 a metric ton ($3.25 a pound).
Stockpiles fell 0.5 percent to 600,275 tons.  Fed policy makers start a two-day meeting on Sept. 17 to
decide whether to keep buying $85 billion of debt a month.  China 
is the top copper consumer.  In  Chile , workers began a strike over pay yesterday at
Codelco’s Salvador mine, which has annual output of 76,184 tons
of copper.  Chile’s state-owned Codelco, the world’s biggest producer,
has total output of 1.7 million tons.  Nickel rose the most in three weeks in London. Tin,
aluminum, lead and zinc rose.  To contact the reporters on this story:
