Maxim Group LLC hired Hector Cortes,
formerly of PrinceRidge LLC, to sell structured notes.  Cortes started working at the firm in New York last month
and will report to Jamie Terranova, managing director and head
of fixed income, according to Terranova.  “Hector’s addition will broaden both our product mix and
our distribution base,” Terranova said in an e-mail.  Cortes said by telephone that before joining PrinceRidge,
he worked at Nomura Holdings Inc.,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Maxim Group, based in New York, is the latest of several
firms that have announced hires of brokers to sell structured
notes in the last four months. Incapital LLC and JVB Financial
Group LLC opened new offices in August, and PrinceRidge brought
on new managing directors earlier.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
