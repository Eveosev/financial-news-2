Soybeans headed for a fifth weekly
climb in the best run since May on speculation that the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  will cut its production outlook after
hot, dry conditions harmed crops in the world’s biggest grower.  The contract for November delivery rose as much as 0.4
percent to $13.7225 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and
was at $13.67 at 9:45 a.m. in  Singapore , poised to gain 0.7
percent this week.  Futures surged 13 percent in August as the hot weather in
the Midwest threatened yields. The USDA may reduce its domestic
harvest estimate to 3.134 billion bushels from 3.255 billion
forecast last month, according to a survey of analysts and
traders by  Bloomberg News . Rain should remain quite limited in
the eastern Plains, Midwest, and Delta this week, allowing
drought conditions to expand, MDA Information Systems LLC said.  “Weather forecasts for the U.S. Midwest still remain
unfavorable for U.S. soybean production, with above average
temperatures forecast over the next fortnight, leaving the
market concerned that U.S. soybean yields could still decline
further,”  Paul Deane , an agricultural economist at Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Melbourne, wrote in a note
today. The USDA will update the production estimate on Sept. 12.  About 54 percent of U.S. soybeans were rated in good-or-excellent  condition  as of Sept. 1 from 58 percent a week earlier,
according to the USDA. Crops have deteriorated for three
straight weeks, USDA data show.  Wheat for delivery in December declined 0.2 percent to
$6.39 a bushel, down for an eighth day in the worst streak since
July 1. Corn for December delivery advanced 0.2 percent to
$4.6175 a bushel after dropping to $4.57 yesterday, the lowest
price since Aug. 15. Prices are heading for the first weekly
loss in four.  To contact the reporter on this story:
