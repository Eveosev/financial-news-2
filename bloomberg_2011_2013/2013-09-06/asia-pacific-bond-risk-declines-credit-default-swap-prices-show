The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in  Asia  against non-payment fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan declined 2 basis points to 150 basis
points as of 8:34 a.m. in  Singapore , Westpac Banking Corp.
prices show. The gauge is set to fall 13.4 this week, the most
since the period ended July 19, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 1 basis point to 89
as of 9:20 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc. prices.
The measure last closed lower on May 28, according to CMA, which
is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was little changed at
119.5 basis points as of 10:22 a.m. in Sydney, according Westpac
prices. The benchmark is poised for its lowest close since Aug.
16, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
