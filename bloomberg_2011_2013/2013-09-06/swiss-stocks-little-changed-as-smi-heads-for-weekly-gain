Swiss stocks  were little changed,
with the benchmark Swiss Market Index heading for the biggest
weekly gain in eight weeks, as investors awaited a report on
U.S. payrolls to gauge the outlook for Federal Reserve stimulus.  Sonova Holding AG (SOON)  jumped 3.5 percent after UBS AG
recommended buying shares in the maker of hearing aids. Clariant
AG advanced as Nomura Holdings Inc. upgraded its recommendation
on the stock. Schindler Holding AG added 1 percent.  The  SMI (SMI)  fell 0.1 percent to 7,923.61 at 9:36 a.m. in
Zurich. The index has rallied 16 percent so far this year, the
third-best performance of 24 developed markets tracked by
Bloomberg, as the economy of the 17-nation euro area returned to
growth. The broader Swiss Performance Index also retreated 0.1
percent today.  The SMI has gained 2.3 percent so far this week as the
European Central Bank said it will maintain its accommodative
monetary policy and as Chinese manufacturing in August surpassed
estimates.  In the U.S., a Labor Department report at 8:30 a.m. in
 Washington  may show that employers added more workers in August.
Payrolls climbed by 180,000 last month, compared with 162,000 in
July, according to the median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The jobless rate probably held at a more
than four-year low, economists said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
