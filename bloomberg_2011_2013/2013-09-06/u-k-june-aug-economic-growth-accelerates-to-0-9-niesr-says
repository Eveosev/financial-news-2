The  U.K. economy  grew at the fastest
rate in more than three years in the quarter through August,
according to an estimate from the National Institute of Economic
and Social Research.  Gross domestic product  rose 0.9 percent after a 0.7 percent
gain in the three months through July, the London-based
institute, whose clients include the  Bank of England  and the
U.K. Treasury, said in a statement today. That would be the
strongest expansion since July 2010 and would leave GDP 2.7
percent below its early 2008 peak, Niesr said.  The estimate follows data today showing  factory output  rose
for a second month in July, adding to signs of an accelerating
recovery. Risks to growth remain, including related to global
demand after exports plunged in July, pushing the  trade deficit 
to a nine-month high.  “The rate of growth will likely soften, somewhat, over
coming quarters,” Niesr said. “The external environment in the
guise of weak demand from the euro area and slowing  emerging
markets  will likely limit the rate of the U.K.’s economic
expansion.”  The institute repeated its forecast that it doesn’t expect
GDP to regain its previous peak until 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
