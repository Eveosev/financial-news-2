The Spanish government is cutting
the amount of credits given to strategic industries by 12.5
percent to 408 million euros ($531 million) and plans to charge
interest,  Cinco Dias  reported today, citing unidentified people
in the government.  The interest applied to the credits may be in line with
what the Spanish Treasury pays for its long-term debt even as no
decision has been made yet, the newspaper said. Strategic
industries that boost competitiveness include automobiles,
pharmaceuticals and railways, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
