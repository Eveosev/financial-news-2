News Corp. (NWSA) ’s U.K. unit, facing
hundreds more lawsuits over phone-hacking by its now-defunct
News of the World tabloid, was sued by a British comedian and
his ex-wife who posed topless in another Rupert Murdoch paper.  The unit, London-based News International, and its ex-
private eye  Glenn Mulcaire , who was jailed for phone hacking in
2007, were sued April 10 by Robert Nankeville, known as Bobby
Davro, and his former wife Trudi Nankeville, according to court
documents.  Davro, performed on television in the 1980s and later acted
in TV shows including  BBC ’s “EastEnders,” according to IMDB.
His wife was a so-called Page Three Girl, a term used for women
who appear topless on the third page of Murdoch’s Sun daily
tabloid.  News Corp., based in  New York , has spent at least $195
million dealing with the scandal and settling with dozens of
celebrities, lawmakers and crime victims to avoid a public
trial. About 200 new cases are being prepared, lawyers have said
and recent cases were filed by ex-U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair’s wife Cherie and soccer player  David Beckham ’s father.  Murdoch, News Corp.’s chairman, shuttered the News of the
World in July in a bid to contain public anger after it was
revealed the tabloid hacked into the voice mail of a murdered
schoolgirl. London police have arrested more than 30 people in
three related probes of the company and identified more than 800
likely victims of the practice.  News International spokeswoman Mary Kearney declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
