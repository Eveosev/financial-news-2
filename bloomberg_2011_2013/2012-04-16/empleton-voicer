Michael Hasenstab , a senior vice
president who oversees more than $150 billion of global fixed-
income assets at Franklin Templeton Investments, said he would
prefer to gain exposure to  China  indirectly though Korean,
Singaporean and Malaysian bonds until Asia’s largest economy
opens up its capital account.  “If China moves to liberalize its interest-rate policy,
interest rates in China are going to go higher. Those Dim Sum
bonds are tied to Chinese yuan and interest rates so there’s
duration risk in renminbi offshore bonds. One needs to be
selective about yuan purchases.  “We have an  Asian Bond Fund (TEMASAA)  but only a handful of
renminbi-denominated bonds. They tend to be very short duration
and they tend to be very high-quality issues. We’re not taking a
lot of credit risk and we’re not taking a lot of interest-rate
risk, or renminbi  currency risk . We don’t have any direct
holdings off onshore assets because that’s restricted.  “All of Asia has a tremendous indirect exposure, whether
it’s macroeconomic exposure, or simple currency correlation. If
China moves down this path of solid, be it double-digit or 7
percent growth, that gives a boost to Asian exporters. If the
currency gradually appreciates, that’s going to pull the rest of
Asia along with it.  “Korea, Malaysia and Singapore are structurally very tied
to the China growth engine,” Hasenstab said. Investing in their
bonds “is the only meaningful exposure until China opens its
capital account and allows direct investment,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
