Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ) ,  Kazakhstan ’s biggest
copper producer, froze the salary of Chairman Vladimir Kim after
profit fell last year and the stock sank more than 40 percent.  Kim’s base salary will be 1.06 million pounds ($1.68
million) as of July, unchanged from a year earlier, Kazakhmys
said in its  annual report . The chairman received 1.77 million
pounds including benefits and bonus last year, it said.  The London-based company reported a 36 percent decline in
full-year net income on March 27 after booking losses from the
disposal of its petroleum division. Kazakhmys took an impairment
on the unit before selling it in December, leading to a $472
million loss from discontinued operations.  Kazakhmys also froze the pay of other senior management,
citing “economic and market conditions, and the emphasis on
salary restraint from shareholders.” Chief Executive Officer
Oleg Novachuk’s base salary will remain unchanged at 856,000
pounds, it said. He received 1.65 million pounds including
benefits and bonus last year.  Kazakhmys, seeking to boost copper output about two-thirds
to 500,000 metric tons a year by opening two mines, plans to
start production at its Bozshakol project in 2015 and bring the
Aktogay development on stream in 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
