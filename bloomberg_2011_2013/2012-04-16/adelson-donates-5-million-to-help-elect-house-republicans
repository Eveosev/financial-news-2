Sheldon Adelson , a Las Vegas
billionaire whose family had bolstered Republican presidential
candidate  Newt Gingrich ’s campaign, has donated $5 million to a
super political action committee for House Republicans,
according to campaign documents released last night.  Adelson, who is facing Justice Department and Securities
and Exchange Commission investigations, had underwritten the
former U.S. House speaker’s primary bid with $16.5 million.  The February donations were made to the Congressional
Leadership Fund, created last year to maintain the House
Republican majority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
