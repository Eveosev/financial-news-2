U.S. Gulf Coast crude premiums
slumped after Enbridge Inc. and  Enterprise (EPD)  Products Partners LP
said they plan to begin oil shipments on the reversed Seaway
pipeline on about May 17.  The initial transit time will be about 15 days on the
150,000-barrel-a-day line, which is being reversed to transport
oil from Cushing,  Oklahoma , to the U.S. Gulf Coast, said  Rick Rainey , a Houston-based spokesman for Enterprise. The line will
require about 2.5 million barrels of oil to fill.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s (USCSLLSS)  premium to West Texas Intermediate
decreased 90 cents to $19.90 a barrel at 2:05 p.m. New York
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana
Sweet (USCSHLSE)  lost $2 to a premium of $20 a barrel.  Thunder Horse ’s premium narrowed 85 cents to $17 a barrel
over WTI, and  Mars Blend (USCSMARS)  lost $1.50 to a premium of $12.50.
Poseidon’s premium decreased $1.05 to $11.35, while Southern
Green Canyon’s narrowed $1.45 to $11.30.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount was unchanged at $17.25 a
barrel. Syncrude’s held at $1.75 a barrel. Bakken oil’s discount
was unchanged at $7.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
