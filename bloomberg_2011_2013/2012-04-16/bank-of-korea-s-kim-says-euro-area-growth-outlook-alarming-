Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong- Soo said the “alarming” growth outlook in the euro area may be
one reason why government bond yields in Spain and  Italy  are
elevated.  While fiscal tightening may be needed in many countries,
“consolidation may unfortunately bear fruit only after a long
spell of painful economic contraction,” Kim said in a speech in
Frankfurt today. “And it could even defeat its purposes, at
least in the short run.”  Kim said unconventional central bank policy measures on
both sides of the Atlantic have “been pivotal in calming the
markets” and “bought us time for necessary fiscal
adjustment.”  However, “the welcome role of these policies in  crisis
management  is now rapidly approaching its limit,” he said.
“Further monetary easing could do more harm than good when the
financial markets are already flooded with cheap liquidity but
remain nonetheless timid in their lending to the private
sector.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
