Spain ’s bonds declined for a second
day after a minister called on the  European Central Bank  to buy
the nation’s debt and stem the financial-market turmoil.  Ten-year yields reached a four-month high as Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  said the country must cut its  budget deficit  to
maintain access to financing. The cost of insuring Spain’s
securities against default advanced to a record, while
Portuguese 10-year rates rose for an 11th day.  Germany ’s bund
futures climbed to an all-time high as investors sought the
safest assets.  “Clearly investors are again getting worried that Spain
may not be able to overcome its problems without external
help,” said Elwin de Groot, a market economist at Rabobank
Nederland in Utrecht. “One thing that could stop this is ECB
intervention but they are not extremely keen on taking that role
at this point in time. Sentiment is starting to crumble.”  Spain’s  two-year yield  advanced 20 basis points, or 0.2
percentage point, to 3.65 percent at 4:31 p.m.  London  time,
after jumping by as much as 30 basis points to 3.75 percent, the
most since Jan. 9. The 3.4 percent note due in April 2014 fell
0.385, or 3.85 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,307) face amount to
99.52. Ten-year yields rose nine basis points to 6.07 percent
after touching 6.16 percent.  Spanish Slump  Rajoy’s government is attempting to persuade voters and
investors it can avoid following Greece, Ireland and  Portugal  in
seeking a bailout. The country is due to sell as much as 3
billion euros of 12- and 18-month bills tomorrow and 2.5 billion
euros of notes due in October 2014 and January 2022 on April 19.  The government’s “fundamental objective at the moment is
to reduce the deficit,” Rajoy told a conference in  Madrid 
today. “If we don’t achieve this, the rest won’t matter: we
won’t be able to fund our debt, we won’t be able to meet our
commitments.”  Portuguese 10-year yields increased 12 basis points to
12.68 percent. French 10-year yields gained seven basis points
to 3.02 percent. Belgian 10-year yields climbed five basis
points to 3.44 percent and Italian  10-year rates  were seven
basis points higher at 5.59 percent.  The ECB “should step up purchases of bonds,” Jaime Garcia-Legaz, a Spanish deputy minister in Luis de Guindos’s
Economy Ministry, said in an interview on April 13.  Euro Weakens  The euro slid below $1.30 for the first time in two months
today and credit-default swaps insuring Spanish government debt
jumped 19 basis points to a record 521, according to CMA prices.  While ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure signaled on
April 11 the central bank may buy Spanish bonds, his Dutch
colleague Klaas Knot said two days later that the ECB is “very
far” from reactivating the measure. The ECB’s bond buying
program was put on hold a month ago after the central bank’s 1
trillion euros of three-year loans to euro-area banks in
December and February gave sovereign debt from the region’s most
indebted nations a boost.  Volatility in Spanish debt was the highest among euro-area
debt markets, according to measures of 10-year bonds, two- and
10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps compiled by
Bloomberg.  High Volatility  “We expect volatility to remain high also this week with
investors’ mood affected by concerns about Spain and uncertainty
on the evolution of the sovereign crisis,” Giuseppe Maraffino,
a strategist at Barclays Plc in London, wrote in an e-mailed
note. “The market’s focus in  Italy  and Spain is once again
shifting to fundamentals.”  The difference in yield between Spanish 10-year bonds and
similar-maturity German securities, Europe’s benchmark, was at
435 basis points, up from 356 basis points on March 30.  German  10-year government bond yields  were two basis points
lower at 1.72 percent. They reached 1.71 percent, the lowest
since April 10, when the rate dropped to 1.639 percent, within a
basis point of the record reached in September. The German 10-
year bund futures contract expiring in June was little changed
at 140.43, after rising to a record 140.51.  The technical environment is “encouraging” for bund
futures contracts, Viola Stork, an analyst at Helaba Landesbank
Hessen-Thueringen, wrote in an e-mailed note. There is a support
zone at around 139.45 to 139.49, she wrote, and the contract
should trade in a range between 139.79 and 140.70.  Support refers to a level where buy orders may be grouped.  French 10-year bond futures expiring in June were at 125.29
as they started trading today on Eurex,  Europe ’s largest
derivatives exchange. Italian contracts slid 0.5 percent to 101.  Germany will sell two-year notes on April 18, while  France 
plans to sell two-, three- and five-year notes and inflation-
linked bonds on April 19.  German bonds returned 1 percent so far this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish debt dropped 2.1 percent,
while Italy’s rallied 8.9 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
