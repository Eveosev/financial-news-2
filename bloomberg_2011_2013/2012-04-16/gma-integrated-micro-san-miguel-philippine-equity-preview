developer, rose 1.4 percent to 21.10 pesos, the highest close

overseas Filipinos grew at a faster pace, boosting the outlook
for consumer spending on homes and cars.  Robinsons Land Corp. (RLC)

November 2007. Remittances from Filipinos grew 5.8 percent in

owners are asking for 55 billion pesos, the newspaper said.

Philippine capital, increased 1.3 percent to 24.30 pesos, the
