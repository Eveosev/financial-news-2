Marriott International Inc. (MAR) , the
largest publicly traded U.S. hotel chain, agreed to sell its
ExecuStay corporate and temporary housing division to Oakwood
Worldwide for an undisclosed price.  ExecuStay, which offers furnished units to customers who
are usually seeking lodging for 30 or more days, has more than
700 locations nationwide, Bethesda, Maryland-based Marriott said
in a statement today. As part of the agreement with closely held
Oakwood, Marriott will refer customers looking for corporate
housing to the Los Angeles-based company for an eight-year
period, and ExecuStay customers will continue to earn points
under the Marriott Rewards program.  Marriott, which purchased ExecuStay in 1999, is shedding
operations that aren’t focused on hotels. In November, it
completed the spinoff of its timeshare business, which accounted
for about 13 percent of the company’s total revenue. ExecuStay
properties include such amenities as full kitchens and laundry
facilities.  The division’s focus on apartment-style units “was
meaningfully different from  Marriott International (MAR) ’s long-term
business strategy,” David Grissen, president of the Americas
for Marriott, said in the statement.  The sale is “not material” to Marriott’s finances, the
hotelier said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
