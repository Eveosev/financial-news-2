Paula Chan and Ronald Chan,
managing directors of fixed income at Manulife Asset Management
in Hong Kong, comment on the People’s Bank of  China ’s widening
of the yuan’s daily trading band to 1 percent from 0.5 percent.
They made the comments in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg
questions today.  “The timing of the move is in line with the authority’s
stance since end of 2011 and early 2012. The widening of the
currency band is part of the currency liberalization.  “This not only allows greater flexibility for China to
maneuver during the current global economic uncertainties, but
also helps to close the gap between the market volatility of the
onshore yuan and offshore yuan versus the dollar.  “This move will not change the currency forecast for the
yuan this year. A 2 to 3 percent annual appreciation is expected
with higher volatility.  “The implications for the Dim Sum bond market are positive
as the gap between the offshore yuan and the onshore rate is
expected to become tighter, which will reduce some of the
concerns investors may have about the volatility between the two
rates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
