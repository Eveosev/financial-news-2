Ford Motor Co. (F) ,  Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG (BMW)  and Honda Motor Co. are marketing $3.15 billion in
securities linked to loans and leases as vehicle sales rise.  Ford plans to sell $1.4 billion in debt backed by auto
loans, according to a person familiar with the offering who
declined to be identified because terms aren’t public. Honda is
offering $1 billion of similar securities, said another person.
BMW, based in Munich, plans to sell $750 million of bonds tied
to leases, the people said.  Bonds linked to auto debt are dominating asset-backed sales
as vehicle purchases climb. Bank of America Merrill Lynch
boosted its 2012 issuance forecast of the securities to $100
billion from $80 billion, according to an April 13 report.  “Higher vehicle sales and the potential for more bank
issuance have caused us to revise our gross new issue,” said
the New York-based analysts led by  Chris Flanagan .  Companies have sold about $55 billion of bonds backed by
consumer and business lending this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Securities linked to automobile sales
accounted for $28 billion of those offerings, the data show.  Bank of America sold $2.37 billion in bonds backed by auto
loans on April 13 in the largest offering of the debt this year,
Bloomberg data show. The deal “may signal a broader return of
banks to the auto loan ABS market,” the analysts said.  March Car Sales  U.S. sales of cars and light trucks rose 13 percent in
March, sending the industry to the best quarterly pace since
2008, according to researcher Autodata Corp. Deliveries
accelerated to a 14.4 million at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate from 13.1 million a year earlier, according Autodata.  Investors are demanding 59 basis points more than
Treasuries to hold top-ranked asset-backed securities linked to
auto loans, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.
The spread had climbed to 94 basis points as of Dec. 31 from 60
basis points at the start of July. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Ford sold $1.6 billion debt backed by auto loans on Jan.
18, according to Bloomberg data. The top-ranked securities
maturing in 2.3 years priced to yield 23 basis points more than
the benchmark swap rate. Honda paid 18 basis points over the
benchmark at its most recent sale of similar debt on Feb. 14.  The sale from BMW is the automaker’s first offering of its
kind this year, the data show. The company sold $1 billion of
the debt in April 2011, paying a spread of 37 basis points more
than swaps. Issues composed of lease payments are more dependent
on used car values and typically pay a higher spread.  To contact the reporter on this story:
