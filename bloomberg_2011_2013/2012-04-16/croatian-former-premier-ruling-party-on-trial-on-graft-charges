A Croatian county court said it
will begin a corruption trial today involving the  Croatian
Democratic Union , which lost elections in December to an
opposition bloc, and former premier Ivo Sanader.  The party, which ruled for 17 of the 21 years since
 Croatia ’s independence in 1990, Sanader and three other party
officials were charged by the Public Prosecutor for allegedly
siphoning money from state companies, the court in Zagreb said
in a statement on its  website .  The party is accused of illegally gaining 31.6 million-kuna
($5.5 million), while Sanader illegally gained 15 million kuna,
prosecutors have alleged. Both Sanader and party officials have
denied the accusations.  The  Croatian Democratic Union  lost a Dec. 4 election to a
group led by the  Social Democrats  amid several corruption
scandals involving top party officials. Sanader was premier from
2003 to July 2009, when he left without explanation. He was
arrested in Austria in 2010 on an international warrant and
extradited to Croatia in July 2011.  This is the third indictment for Sanader, who is also on
trial for alleged corruption in cases involving  Hungary ’s  Mol
Nyrt. (MOL)  and Austria’s Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
