Asian currencies fell the most in
four weeks on speculation  Europe ’s debt crisis will sap demand
for riskier assets, overshadowing  China ’s decision to widen its
currency trading band for the first time in five years.  Malaysia’s ringgit fell the most since March 20, snapping a
three-day rally, after the cost of insuring Spain’s bonds
against default surged to a record last week. South Korea’s won
retreated from a one-week high after the central bank trimmed
its 2012 growth forecast and the yuan slid the most in three
months after People’s Bank of China weakened its daily reference
rate.  “A weakening in Europe’s economy would hurt export
sentiment since  Asia  exports a lot of goods to Europe,” said
Sean Yokota, a currency strategist at UBS AG in Singapore.
“ Risk aversion  encourages people to buy dollars and Treasuries
as a safe haven, and that hurts Asian currencies.”  The ringgit weakened 0.6 percent to 3.0720 per dollar as of
3:55 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. India’s rupee fell 0.7 percent to a three-month low
of 51.65, the won lost 0.3 percent to 1,138.63 and the
Philippine peso lost 0.4 percent to 42.785. The yuan dropped 0.2
percent to 6.3147, touching as low as 6.3250.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar  Index (ADXY) , which tracks the
region’s 10 most-used currencies excluding the yen, fell 0.24
percent, the most since March 20. The MSCI  Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  of
stocks declined 0.8 percent.  Outlook Dims  Yields on Spain’s 10-year  notes  exceeded 6 percent today,
approaching the 7 percent level that prompted Greece, Ireland
and Portugal to seek bailouts. South Korea’s central bank
lowered its 2012 growth forecast today to 3.5 percent, from a
December estimate of 3.7 percent, amid volatile oil prices and
concern about Europe’s debt crisis.  The People’s Bank of China weakened its daily fixing for
the yuan by 0.13 percent to 6.2960 per dollar after doubling the
limit of the currency’s moves to 1 percent from the  reference
rate . The yuan fell to as much as 0.46 percent versus the
fixing, not making use of the new limit. The trading band was
last widened in May 2007, to 0.5 percent from 0.3 percent.  “The message of this move is that the renminbi’s
appreciation story is over,”  Qu Hongbin , chief economist for
China at HSBC Holdings Plc, said on April 14 after the
announcement. “Greater two-way volatility will be the name of
the game going forward.”  Yuan Volatility  Yuan volatility has risen since February as bets for
appreciation waned amid an economic slowdown and Chinese
officials said the  exchange rate  may be near its equilibrium.
Three-month implied volatility jumped as much as 50 basis points
today to 2.9 percent, the highest level since Jan. 6.  Indonesia’s rupiah depreciated 0.6 percent to 9,194 per
dollar. Global funds cut ownership of local stocks by $44
million last week and trimmed their holding of local-currency
debt by 540 billion rupiah ($59 million) in the four days
through April 12, according to stock exchange and finance
ministry data.  Elsewhere, Taiwan’s dollar slipped 0.1 percent to NT$29.564
versus the greenback and Vietnam’s dong appreciated 0.4 percent
to 20,838. Financial markets in  Thailand  are closed for a public
holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
