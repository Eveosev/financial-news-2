Azerbaijanâ€™s economy expanded 0.5
percent from a year earlier in the first quarter, President
 Ilham Aliyev  said today, the Azartac news service reported.  Excluding the oil industry, the economy grew 7.7 percent,
while inflation was 3.1 percent, state-run Azartac quoted Aliyev
as saying.  The government plans to spend 1 billion manats ($1.27
billion) on compensating depositors who lost their savings when
the Soviet banking industry collapsed 20 years ago, Aliyev said,
according to Azartac.  To contact the reporter on this story:
