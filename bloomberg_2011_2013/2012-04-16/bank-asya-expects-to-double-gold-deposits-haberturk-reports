Asya Katilim Bankasi AS (ASYAB) , an
Istanbul-based Islamic bank, expects its gold deposit accounts
to double by the end of this year, Haberturk newspaper reported,
citing Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Celik.  The bank, also known as Bank Asya, currently has 1 ton of
gold stored in such accounts and plans to pay a profit-share to
attract more customers, Celik said, according to Haberturk.
Profit share is a mechanism used by Islamic lenders that
corresponds to interest payments.  Bank Asya’s accounts allow customers who keep gold at home
to store it on deposit, and the bank charges a 1 percent
commission that is much lower than typically levied by
jewellers, Haberturk quoted Celik as saying.  Bank Asya is looking forward to proposed legislation that
will allow  Turkey ’s government to sell sukuk, or Islamic bonds,
the newspaper quoted Celik as saying. That would create
opportunities for the bank to sell its own sukuk domestically
and abroad, Celik said.  Click here for web link
