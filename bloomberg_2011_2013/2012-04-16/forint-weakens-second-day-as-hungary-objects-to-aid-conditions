The forint declined for a second
day on concern Hungary won’t give in to all demands by the
European Union and the  International Monetary Fund  in return for
a  credit line .  Hungary’s currency depreciated 0.6 percent to 299.3 per
euro by 9:03 a.m. in Budapest. A close at that level would be
the weakest since Jan. 23.  The European Commission shouldn’t make demands of Hungary
that aren’t related to economic issues in exchange for a
bailout, Mihaly Varga, Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s chief of
staff, told HirTV late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
