(Corrects to show foundation’s cost is included in the
spending in second paragraph of story published April 16.)  The Guggenheim Foundation project
to establish a fourth European museum in Helsinki gained the
approval of the city’s mayor.  Jussi Pajunen proposed the city council approve the plan to
establish a Guggenheim museum in the Finnish capital, according
to e-mailed documents by the City of Helsinki. The city should
this year set aside 2.8 million euros ($3.7 million) to pay for
the museum’s license and other costs, including 500,000 euros to
establish a foundation to run the museum, the proposal said.  Helsinki backs the plan to set up the gallery to increase
tourism and strengthen its image as a design and technology hub.
The 140 million-euro museum would mostly be a non-collecting
institution hosting traveling exhibitions of contemporary art,
with attendance estimated at about half a million people.  The Guggenheim Bilbao museum in Spain, designed by  Frank Gehry , has attracted more than 10 million visitors since it was
first opened in 1997. The Bilbao museum will have right of
approval of the Helsinki museum. The foundation also operates
museums in  New York , Berlin,  Venice  and  Abu Dhabi .  Helsinki’s City Council is scheduled to decide on the
construction of the museum in the autumn of 2013, the mayor’s
proposal showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
