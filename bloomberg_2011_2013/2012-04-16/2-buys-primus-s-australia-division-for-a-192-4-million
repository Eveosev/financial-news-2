M2 Telecommunications Group Ltd. (MTU) 
agreed to pay A$192.4 million ($199 million) for  Primus
Telecommunications Group Inc. (PTGI) ’s Australian operations to add
customers and infrastructure for Internet and phone services.  M2 will sell A$83 million in new shares at a discount and
has set up a A$250 million bridge loan to fund the purchase and
refinance existing debt, the Melbourne-based company said in a
statement today. The all-cash transaction, expected to be
completed June 1, will contribute to  earnings  in the financial
year starting July 1, M2 said.  The purchase will add 165,000 customer contracts and allow
the company to tap opportunities presented by Australia’s
planned A$36 billion broadband network, M2 said. The combined
entity will be the fifth-largest telecommunications company in
the nation, after Telstra Corp., Singapore Telecommunications
Ltd.’s Optus, Vodafone Hutchison  Australia  Pty. and IiNet Ltd.,
said Geoff Horth, M2’s chief executive officer.  “People will increasingly consume a broader range of
services” such as cloud computing, Horth said on a conference
call after the company’s announcement. “The things that we’ve
acquired in this model tick the box on all those elements.”  The planned  share issue  is equivalent to 20 percent of M2’s
current market value. Investors will be able to buy one new
share at A$2.66 for every four already held, a 24 percent
discount to the April 13 closing price.  M2 fell 4.6 percent to A$3.33 at the close in Sydney
trading, the stock’s largest decline since Dec. 19. Australia’s
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index dropped 0.5 percent.  Small-Business Clients  Adding Primus’s Internet infrastructure will help M2
service its core base of small-business customers, Horth said.
About 52 percent of Primus’s sales are to individual households,
leaving M2 with about a third of  revenues  from consumers rather
than businesses, he said.  The company plans to maintain its current  dividend  payout
ratio of 70 percent of net income after the acquisition. M2 also
affirmed its forecast for profit to rise to as much as A$34
million in the 12 months ending June.  Net debt would total A$137.7 million, about 1.4 times the
combined company’s  earnings  before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, based on the two companies’ results for the
year ended Dec. 31, according to the statement.  The debt facility must be paid down at a rate of A$20
million annually over three years, Horth said. “That will
absolutely be our minimum” level of repayment, he said.  M2 had net debt of A$9.7 million as of Dec. 31, according
to  data compiled  by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
