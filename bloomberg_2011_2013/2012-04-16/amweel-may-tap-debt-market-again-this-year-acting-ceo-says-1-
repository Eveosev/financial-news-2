Tamweel PJSC (TAMWEEL)  may consider tapping
the debt market again this year after the United Arab Emirates
mortgage lender raised $300 million from the sale of Islamic
bonds in January.  “We may potentially go back to the market this year for
either a sukuk or securitization,” acting Chief Executive
OfficerVarun Sood said in an interview in Dubai today. “It
would be a similar transaction to what we did earlier this
year.”  The mortgage company, controlled by  Dubai Islamic Bank
PJSC (DIB) , sold $300 million in sukuk in January, its first offering
since 2008. The yield on its 5.154 percent bonds due January
2017 was at 5.13 percent today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Sales of Islamic debt in the Gulf surged to $8.46 billion
this year from $1.53 billion in the year-earlier period as
borrowing costs tumbled to a five-month low. Average yields on
sukuk from the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council declined 41
basis points this year to 3.898 percent on March 29, the lowest
since October. The rate was at 3.93 percent on April 13, the
HSBC/Nasdaq Dubai GCC US Dollar Sukuk Index shows.  Mortgage Recovery  Tamweel has 3.3 billion dirhams ($900 million) of
 outstanding debt , including a $300 million Islamic bond due
January 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company is “preparing to meet all our commitments, but there’s
been no decision whether we’ll refinance or repay the sukuk in
January 2013,” Sood said.  Tamweel, which along with fellow Islamic lender  Amlak PJSC (AMLAK) 
provided almost 90 percent of all mortgages in the U.A.E.,
halted lending in October 2008 after the global credit crisis
blocked its access to funds. The company resumed lending in
November 2010 after Dubai Islamic Bank, the U.A.E.’s biggest
bank that complies with Muslim banking rules, raised its stake
in Tamweel to 58 percent to help boost the mortgage market.  Mortgage transactions at Tamweel rose 10 percent to 15
percent during the first quarter of the year from a year
earlier, in line with the Dubai mortgage market as prices
started to recover, Sood said.  “It’s been good news so far this year,” he said. “Prices
have been rising, and villas are clearly leading the recovery.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
