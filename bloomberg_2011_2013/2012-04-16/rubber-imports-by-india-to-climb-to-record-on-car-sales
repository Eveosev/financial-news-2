Natural-rubber imports by India,
the world’s third-biggest consumer, may climb as much as 10
percent to a record this year as the highest-ever car sales
boost demand for the commodity used in tires.  Purchases may climb to about 225,000 metric tons in the
year that began on April 1 from 205,050 tons a year earlier,
said Rajiv Budhraja, director general of India’s Automotive Tyre
Manufacturers’ Association.  Rising Indian purchases may help futures in Tokyo extend a
16 percent rally this year and increase costs for tiremakers
including  MRF Ltd. (MRF)  and  Apollo Tyres Ltd. (APTY)   The Society of Indian
Automobile Manufacturers  estimates that passenger car sales will
gain 10 percent to 12 percent this fiscal year, extending record
monthly sales in January, February and March.  “The growth in Indian tire consumption this year will be
around 6 percent to 8 percent as passenger car and commercial
vehicle sales improve,” Budhraja said in a phone interview from
 New Delhi  on April 12. “For the economy as a whole, the odds of
it going the way of last year’s trend is not there as  interest
rates  are softening, and the monsoon is likely to be normal.”  The  Reserve Bank  of  India , which raised  interest rates  by a
record 3.75 percentage points from March 2010 to October last
year to contain price increases, may begin cutting rates in
April, Economics Affairs Secretary R. Gopalan said last month.  India’s rubber imports have been gaining in recent months
as farmers are holding back supplies in anticipation of higher
prices, Budhraja said.  Price Increase  “There has been a consistent, progressive increase in
rubber price,” he said. “The 200-rupees level has become like
a psychological level with growers, so any drop below this level
they tend to hold on to their stocks.”  The  benchmark RSS-4 rubber  in India was at 198 rupees
($3.83) a kilogram on April 13, 3.1 percent more than a month
earlier, according to the state-owned Rubber Board. September-
delivery rubber fell 1.1 percent to close at 306 yen a kilogram
($3,791 a ton) on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange.  The natural-rubber deficit in India will widen as increased
car sales and tire production boost demand, according to Vinod Simon, president of the All India Rubber Industries Association.
The shortage may climb to 511,000 tons in 2014-2015 from more
than 100,000 tons in 2012-2013, Simon said last month, basing
his view on economic growth of 6.5 percent a year.  “The shortage will progressively widen on account of
India’s constraints in increasing the domestic production,” Jom Jacob, a senior economist at the Association of Natural Rubber
Producing Countries, said in an e-mail. “There is acute
shortage of skilled as well as unskilled laborers.”  Production in India climbed 4.3 percent to 899,400 tons in
the year ended March from 861,950 tons a year earlier, while
consumption advanced 2 percent to 966,215 tons, the board said.
Inventory at the end of March were 230,000 tons, down 20 percent
from a year earlier, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
