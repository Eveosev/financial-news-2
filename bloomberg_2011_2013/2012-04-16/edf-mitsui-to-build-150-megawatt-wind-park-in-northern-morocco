EDF Energies Nouvelles SA (EEN)  and
Mitsui & Co. Ltd. were chosen to build a 150-megawatt wind park
by  Morocco ’s Office National de l’Electricite SA.  They will build the project east of Fes, northern Morocco,
with 50 turbines made by  Alstom SA (ALO) , EDF Energies Nouvelles, the
renewables division of the French utility, said in a statement.  Morocco seeks to develop clean energy to curb dependence on
fossil fuels. It’s planning 2 gigawatts of wind, 2 gigawatts of
solar and the same of hydropower by 2020 to try to generate 20
percent of its electricity from renewable sources by then.  The companies will subcontract at least 30 percent of the
construction to Moroccan companies, according to the statement.
EDF Energies Nouvelles will open unit EDF EN Maroc in Casablanca
to design, finance and build the Taza facility with Mitsui. The
park started as a public-private initiative in 2011 and bidding
for a further 850 megawatts of capacity has begun, EDF said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
