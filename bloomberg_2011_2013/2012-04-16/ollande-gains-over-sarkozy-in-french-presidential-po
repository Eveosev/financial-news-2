French Socialist candidate  Francois Hollande  would defeat President  Nicolas Sarkozy  in both rounds
of the presidential elections, a fourth opinion poll in less
than a week showed.  Hollande would win the first round of balloting on April 22
with 27.5 percent of the vote against Sarkozy’s 27 percent,  Ifop
institute showed  in its daily survey today. Support rose by a
half percentage point for Hollande and fell one point for the
incumbent, compared with the last survey on April 13, the Paris-
based pollster said.  Hollande would defeat Sarkozy 55 percent to 45 percent in
the final round of the election due on May 6, said Ifop, which
is conducting the survey for Paris Match weekly magazine. The
results reflect a trend shown in polls by CSA on April 10, BVA
on April 11 and TNS-Sofres on April 13.  Jean-Luc Melenchon, a Communist-backed candidate, would get
14 percent of the vote in the first round, up one percentage
point, and National Front candidate Marine Le Pen would garner
16 percent, the same level as on April 13, Ifop said.  French voters will choose from among 10 candidates in the
first round. The two front-runners will faceoff in the second.  Ifop interviewed 900 registered voters for today’s survey.
