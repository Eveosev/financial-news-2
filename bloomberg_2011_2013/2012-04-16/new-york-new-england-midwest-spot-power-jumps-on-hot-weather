Wholesale power in the U.S.
Northeast surged as warmer-than-normal weather prompted
households and businesses to turn on their air conditioners.  New York  City  spot power  traded between $30 and $192.07 a
megawatt-hour from 10 a.m. to 12:15 p.m., and were at similar
levels across the grid, according to the New York Independent
System Operator Inc. Power traded at $153.78 at 12:15 p.m.  New England   wholesale electricity  jumped to $117.79 to
$118.25 a megawatt-hour for the 25 minutes ended 10:40 a.m., the
highest prices since March 7, from the $30-range an hour
earlier, according to ISO New England Inc., which operates the
grid extending from  Connecticut  to  Maine . Prices were at $40.67
at 12:10 p.m.  Electricity consumption is running above forecasts across

wind generation boosted prices in Indiana and  Michigan .  Indiana and Michigan  Wholesale electricity  at the Indiana hub jumped to $113.27
