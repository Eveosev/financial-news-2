Spanish state-owned airport
operator Aena Aeropuertos SA may auction its duty-free stores
managed by Aldeasa,  Expansion  reported today, citing
unidentified people.  Aldeasaâ€™s stores generate more than 200 million euros ($261
million) a year and its contract ends in Dec., the newspaper
said. Before a possible initial public offering of Aena in two
years, the operator wants to cut costs and increase revenue from
commercial activities, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
