The pound reached the strongest
level in 18 months against the euro as investors sought the
perceived safety of U.K. assets amid concern  Europe ’s debt
crisis is deepening.  Sterling advanced for a second day versus the 17-nation
euro after an industry report showed asking prices for U.K.
homes increased to a record, adding to signs Britain’s economy
will outperform Europe’s. Gilts gained.  Bank of England  policy
makers kept their asset-purchase target, or quantitative easing,
at 325 billion pounds ($515 billion) at this month’s meeting,
the minutes of which will be published on April 18.  “The pound is doing quite well -- it’s the European
sovereign debt crisis,” said Peter Kinsella, a senior currency
strategist at Commerzbank AG in London. “You increasingly see
the buying of U.K. safe-haven securities such as gilts. There’s
much less of a likelihood that we’re going to have further QE.
That’s less of a burden for the pound.”  The U.K. currency appreciated 0.1 percent to 82.46 pence
per euro at 4:11 p.m.  London  time after rising to 82.10 pence,
he strongest level since Sept. 9, 2010. Sterling was little
changed at $1.5851.  The pound has climbed 0.6 percent in the past month, the
second best performer among the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes after the yen,
which gained 4.8 percent. The euro dropped 0.5 percent.  Home Prices  Average asking prices for homes in England and  Wales  gained
2.9 percent in April, according to Rightmove Plc, the operator
of Britain’s biggest property website. Prices in London
increased 2.1 percent from the previous month to a record
464,944 pounds. In a separate report today, BDO LLP said its
output index rose to about the 95 level that indicated growth
for the first time since last summer.  Gilts gained for a second day as the European concerns
spurred demand for safer assets. The yield on the 10-year gilt
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.03 percent.
The 4 percent bond maturing in March 2022 rose 0.09, or 90 pence
per 1,000-pound face amount, to 117.55.  U.K. government bonds pared gains after a U.S. report
showed retail sales rose more in March than analysts forecast,
boosting investors’ appetite for higher-yielding assets. Sales
climbed 0.8 percent, versus the median 0.3 percent gain forecast
by economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  ‘Uncertain Euro’  The pound will weaken against the dollar because of its
exposure to the euro area, according to Morgan Stanley. A
decline below $1.5830 will trigger a renewed sell signal for the
British currency, the bank said in an e-mailed note today.  “High exposure into a slowing and uncertain  euro zone  will
weigh on the pound,” wrote Morgan Stanley analysts including
Hans-Guenter Redeker, head of currency strategy in London.
“Underlying economic data, as highlighted by the recent trade
numbers, remain fragile.”  Morgan Stanley predicts the Bank of England will expand its
bond-purchase program next month to support the economy, putting
additional pressure on the pound. Policy makers meet to review
monetary policy on May 10.  Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s austerity policies, which
helped U.K. debt beat world peers in 2011, are backfiring in the
 bond market  with the economy on the brink of a recession and
borrowing needs approaching records.  Gilts lost 1.9 percent in the first quarter, the worst
start since 1996, after returning 17 percent last year,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Falling
revenue means government bond sales in the next 12 months will
be 64 percent higher than the average over the past decade.  The Debt Management Office is scheduled to auction 1.35
billion pounds of inflation-linked bonds due 2029 on April 19.
It will sell bills the following day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
