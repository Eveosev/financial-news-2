Telekomunikacja Polska SA (TPS) , the
Polish unit of  France Telecom SA (FTE) , will present a three-year
strategy in February next year, Chief Executive Officer Maciej Witucki told reporters today.  Poland’s biggest phone company, which today started
offering all services under its parent company’s Orange name,
sees no impact on earnings from the rebranding this year,
Witucki said in Warsaw.  Telekomunikacja will pay a license fee of 1.6 percent from
sales of rebranded operations, excluding wholesale services and
a lower charge for its fixed-line retail business, according to
a statement on March 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
