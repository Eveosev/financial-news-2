French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
said his policies have effectively killed the 35-hour work week.  “It has been abolished,” Sarkozy said in an interview on
France 2 television, six days before the first round of
presidential elections.  Sarkozy, who is trailing in polls behind Socialist Francois Hollande, was asked why he hadn’t repealed the work-week limit
instituted by a Socialist government in 2000. He responded that
his government had in effect eliminated the law by extending the
number of overtime hours allowed and not taxing overtime work.  Sarkozy said nine million workers were using the
extensions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
