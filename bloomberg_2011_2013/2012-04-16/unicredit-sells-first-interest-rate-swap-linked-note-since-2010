UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,  Italy ’s biggest
bank, sold its first structured note paying returns linked to
interest-rate swaps since 2010.  UniCredit raised 25 million euros ($33 million) from
selling a 15-year note on April 2 that will, at the lender’s
choice, pay either a fixed rate of interest or a coupon tied to
so-called constant-maturity swap rates, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. These are benchmarks that measure the
cost of exchanging fixed and floating interest rates in the swap
market.  The notes will initially pay an annual coupon of 6 percent,
Bloomberg data show. Every three years, Milan-based UniCredit
has the option of switching the interest payments to a rate
linked to 20-year constant maturity swaps.  Notes linked to constant maturity swap rates allow
investors to bet on the future direction of  interest rates . The
euro 20-year swap rate is 2.57 percent.  UniCredit’s last such issue was its 4-million euro security
sold Nov. 12, 2010, Bloomberg data show.  Structured notes are bank-issued securities that combine
bonds with derivatives, contracts whose value is linked to the
price of stocks, interest rates, currencies or commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
