OAO Gazprom Neft (GZPFY)  slumped the most
in three weeks and OAO GMK  Norilsk Nickel  slid on concern
slowing growth in China will restrain demand for commodities.  Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of  Russia ’s natural gas export
monopoly, tumbled the most since March 22 on April 13, bringing
its weekly decline to 2.1 percent, the most since the week ended
March 16. Norilsk, the world’s biggest nickel producer,  fell  for
a fourth straight week, exacerbating the steepest run of losses
in the Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of Russian shares traded
in  New York  since 2008. Futures expiring in June on the  RTS (RTSI$) 
Index added 0.3 percent to 157,355 in U.S. trading.  Crude dropped for the first time in three days on April 13
after  China  said  gross domestic product  rose 8.1 percent in the
first quarter, below the median analyst estimate and the slowest
pace for 11 quarters. Copper and nickel tumbled on concern a
retreat in the world’s second-largest economy and biggest
exporter of goods will crimp demand for raw materials. Russia is
the world’s largest energy exporter.  “Chinese growth dictates the demand for oil and metals and
any sign of a slowdown creates fear for Russian commodity
producers,” Dmitry Mikhailov, who manages $130 million as a
portfolio manager at Renaissance Capital Ltd., said by phone
from Moscow on April 13. “China is like a bull in a china shop,
one slight negative move has a large effect on Russia.”  Sales of oil and gas provided almost 50 percent of the
Russian government’s revenue last year and make up 17 percent of
GDP.  Norilsk (NILSY)  is the world’s largest producer of nickel and
palladium.  Saudi Oil Move  American depositary receipts of Moscow-based Gazprom Neft
fell 2.7 percent to $25.94 on April 13, snapping three weeks of
gains to slide 2.1 percent. The ADRs traded at a 0.2 percent
discount to the  Moscow shares , which declined 1.8 percent last
week to 153.82 rubles, or $5.20. One ADR is equal to 5 ordinary
shares.  Oil, Russia’s biggest export earner, retreated as China’s
economic growth slowed and  Saudi Arabia ’s Oil Minister Ali al-
Naimi said the kingdom is working toward damping prices. Crude
for May delivery slumped 0.5 percent to $102.83 a barrel on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  last week.  Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend, dropped 1.6
percent for its fifth week of declines to $117.53.  ADRs of Norilsk, Russia’s biggest mining company, fell 0.6
percent to $17.74 in U.S. trading on April 13 for a 3 percent
slide in the week, the fourth straight weekly loss. The U.S.
shares traded at a 0.3 percent premium to those listed in
Moscow, which retreated 1.4 percent to 5,237 rubles, or $179.95.
One ADR represents one-10th of an ordinary share.  Worst Run Since 2008  Norilsk got 22 percent of revenue from  Asia  in 2010, up
from 14 percent in 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
 Standard & Poor’s GSCI index  of 24 raw materials fell 0.8
percent to 682.17 on April 13, declining 1 percent last week.
Nickel, copper, aluminum and lead slipped in  London .  The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  lost 0.9 percent to
104.56 on April 13, bringing its slide last week to 1.6 percent.
It was the sixth straight weekly decline and the longest run of
losses since 2008.  Russia-focused (INDEXCF)  equity funds saw outflows for the first week
since January, and investors pulled cash from Brazilian stock
funds for a fourth week, according to EPFR Global.  Outflows from Russian funds reached $40 million in the week
to April 11 after cumulative inflows of $1.3 million in the
previous 10 weeks, data compiled by EPFR, a Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based research firm, showed.  Russia ETF Slump  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, fell 0.6 percent to $30.14 on April 13,
losing 1.6 percent last week. It was also the sixth week of
declines for the ETF, the most consecutive drops since 2008. The
 RTS Volatility Index (RTSVX) , which measures expected swings in the
index futures, lost 1.7 percent to 31.21 points in U.S. trading
on April 13.  Urals crude is expected to average $122.90 per barrel in
2012, compared with a previous estimate of $102.60, Credit
Suisse AG analysts led by Zoltan Palfi in London wrote in an e-
mailed report on April 13. The bank raised the forecast by 16
percent to $129.90 per barrel in 2013 and by 13 percent to
$132.40 in 2014, according to the report.  “A higher oil price does not change the underlying picture
of deteriorating profitability driven by escalating costs and
increasing fiscal burden,” the analysts said in the report.
“Relative to international peers, on our forecasts the Russian
 oil companies  do not screen as either being cheap or offering
superior volume growth outlook on a sector level.”  Sell Rosneft  Credit Suisse reiterated its underperform recommendation on
state-run  OAO Rosneft (ROSN) , Russia’s biggest oil producer, and
increased its target price 6 percent to 180 rubles ($6.08) per
share. The rating suggests that investors sell the stock.  OAO
Lukoil (LUKOY) , Russia’s largest independent crude producer, had its
Moscow-traded share-price target raised by 5 percent to 1,790
rubles per share and its neutral rating reiterated.  Lukoil fell for the first time in three trading days in New
York on April 13, dropping 0.8 percent to $61.39 and trimming
its weekly advance to 0.4 percent. Stock traded on Moscow’s
Micex Index declined 0.1 percent to 1,812.10 rubles, or $61.21,
reducing last week’s gain to 2.3 percent.  Russia’s 30-stock Micex dropped 1.3 percent last week to
1,502.65 in Moscow, while the  RTS (RTSI$)  gauge was little changed at
1,612.74. It was the Micex’s third straight weekly drop, the
longest run of declines this year.  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,
was unchanged at HK$5.76 in Hong Kong trading as of 10:55 a.m.
local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.9 percent today
as a surge in the cost of insuring against a Spanish debt
default fueled concerns over  Europe ’s debt crisis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
