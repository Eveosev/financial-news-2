Japanese  stock   futures  were little
changed after a bigger-than-expected increase in U.S. retail
sales countered lingering concerns that Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis is spreading. Australian equity futures rose.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , Japan’s biggest
camera maker that gets almost 60 percent of its sales in the
Americas and Europe, fell 0.4 percent from the closing share
price in Tokyo. Those of  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) ,
Japan’s largest lender, dropped 0.9 percent. ADRs of  Woodside
Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s No. 2 oil and gas producer, added
0.3 percent after crude prices rose.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
June closed at 9,470 in Chicago yesterday, unchanged from the
level in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,480
in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index added 0.2 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
rose 0.2 percent in Wellington.  “We may well see some points of strength in the Asian
markets today,” said Angus Gluskie, managing director at White
Funds Management in Sydney, who manages more than $350 million.
“The employment and economic momentum in the U.S. has certainly
increased significantly.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today after the index fell less than 0.1 percent in New
York yesterday. Most U.S. shares rose after a report showed
retail sales gained 0.8 percent in March, almost three times as
much as economists projected.  Spanish Bond Yields  Asian shares declined yesterday amid concern Spain may
become the next euro-zone nation that will need a financial
rescue as it struggles to cut its  budget deficit . Spain’s 10-
year government bond yields yesterday rose nine basis points to
6.07 percent ahead of today’s auction of bills.  Crude oil for May delivery gained 10 cents to settle at
$102.93 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are
up 4.1 percent this year.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. lost 1.5 percent to 101.62 yesterday
in New York. China Eastern Airlines Corp. tumbled to the lowest
level in six months in U.S. trading on concern a more flexible
yuan will erode foreign-exchange gains.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose 9.1 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with an 8.9 percent gain by the  S&P
500  and a 4 percent advance by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.6 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.1 times for the S&P 500
and 10.6 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
