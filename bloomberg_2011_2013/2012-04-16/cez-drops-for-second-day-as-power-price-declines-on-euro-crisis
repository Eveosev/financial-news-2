CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest Czech utility,
fell for a second day as electricity prices slid on concern
Europe’s worsening debt crisis and slower growth in Asia will
hurt demand for commodities and energy.  The stock declined 1 percent to 765 koruna by 10:50 a.m. in
Prague, after slumping 2.1 percent in the previous session to
its lowest level in 2 1/2 months. The 14-member  PX (PX)  equity gauge,
where CEZ has a 21 percent weighting, retreated 0.8 percent
today.  Commodities tumbled as Spanish bond yields rose to a four-
month high ahead of auctions this week, approaching levels that
prompted Greece, Ireland and Portugal to seek bailouts, and
South Korea’s central bank cut its growth estimate for  Asia ’s
fourth-largest economy. Power for next-year delivery in Germany,
where CEZ exports part of its output, dropped 1 percent to 51.15
euros per megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
