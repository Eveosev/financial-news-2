The Bovespa index declined as a
drop in commodities prices dimmed the outlook for Brazilian
producers amid concern a worsening debt crisis in Europe will
hurt global growth.  Vale SA (VALE5)  followed metals prices lower, contributing the most
to the gauge’s drop. The MSCI Brazil/Materials index fell the
most among 10 industry groups.  Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes
SA (GOLL4) , Brazil’s second-biggest airline by market value, slid after
saying its occupancy rate declined 4.5 percentage points to 64.3
percent in March.  The Bovespa sank 0.5 percent to 61,783.25 at 11:16 a.m. in
Sao Paulo. Forty-four stocks tumbled on the gauge while 22
advanced. The real was little changed at 1.8383 per  U.S. dollar .
The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials fell 1.1
percent.  “What we’re seeing now is increasing risk aversion in the
global markets, sparked by concern about  Europe ’s debt and about
the state of the economy in Asia,” Renato Bandeira de Mello,
head of equity trading at Futura Corretora, said by phone from
Sao Paulo. “It’s hard for the Bovespa to perform well in such
scenario.”  Commodities fell while yields on Spanish bonds climbed as a
government minister called on the  European Central Bank  to buy
the nation’s debt to stem the financial-market turmoil and after
South Korea’s central bank said the country will expand 3.5
percent in 2012, compared with 3.7 percent estimated in
December.  Vale dropped 1.2 percent to 41.42 reais. Gol slid 2.1
percent to 10.29 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
