The cost of insuring against
default on European corporate debt rose, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings jumped 17 basis
points to 692.5 at 7:30 a.m. in London. An increase signals
deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 4 basis points to 147.5 basis
points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers increased 4.5 basis points to 251.5 and
the subordinated index climbed eight to 410.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13 million) of debt from default for five years
is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face
value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
