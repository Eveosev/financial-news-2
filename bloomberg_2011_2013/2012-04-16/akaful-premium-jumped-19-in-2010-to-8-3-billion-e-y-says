Global Islamic insurance
contributions surged 19 percent in 2010 to $8.3 billion helped
by  Saudi Arabia , the world’s biggest oil exporter, which made up
more than half the industry, an Ernst & Young report said.  The six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, which also
includes the  United Arab Emirates , Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and
 Kuwait , made $5.68 billion of Islamic insurance or takaful
contributions in 2010, and South East Asia $2 billion, according
to the World Takaful Report 2012 e-mailed today.  Growth in the GCC slowed to 16 percent in 2010 from an
annual average of 41 percent between 2005 and 2009 as the
implementation of compulsory medical insurance in Saudi Arabia
and  Abu Dhabi  was completed earlier, it said.  The growth amid a “global economic meltdown is definitely
commendable,” Ashar Nazim, the head of Islamic financial
services for the  Middle East  and North Africa, at Ernst & Young,
said in a telephone interview from Bahrain yesterday. “With the
current growth trends, and the addition of new fringe markets
such as Indonesia and  Bangladesh , we expect gross contributions
of $12.4 billion by 2012.”  The Kuala Lumpur-based Islamic Financial Services Board
estimates assets of the Islamic finance industry will grow to
$2.8 trillion by 2015 from $1 trillion now. Islamic finance has
a 25 percent share in the GCC and 22 percent in  Malaysia , while
takaful’s share is 15 percent in the GCC and 10 percent in
Malaysia, leaving room for growth, Ernst & Young said.  Strong competition, evolving regulations and shortage of
takaful expertise are key risks in both the GCC and South East
Asia, according to the report. Young Islamic insurance companies
are relying on aggressive pricing to compete against established
companies amid increasingly stringent regulations on capital and
solvency, which is hurting profitability, it said.  “Industry consolidation would allow takaful operators to
compete effectively with larger more established conventional
insurers and also reduce unhealthy price wars,” Nazim said.
“The growth trajectory will change once there is regulatory
clarity, and once you have a champion for the industry, a mega-
takaful company that can lead growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
