Nathan Chow, a Hong Kong-based
economist at DBS Bank ( Hong Kong ) Ltd., comments on China’s
widening of the yuan’s trading band against the dollar. He made
the comments in an emailed statement today.  “At present, the cyclical pressure for yuan appreciation
has eased with lessening inflation. The yuan story has entered a
new phase where the market now considers the currency less
structurally undervalued.”  “Widening the band in conjunction with other actions taken
by the authorities recently, such as the expansion of qualified
foreign institutional investor programs, may further fuel the
volatility of the currency due to increased capital flows.”  “In addition, the authority has also increased the yuan’s
correlation with a basket of currencies in order to enhance the
currency’s two-way flexibility.”  “Against this backdrop, costs will rise for Dim Sum bond
issuers as investors will demand higher yields to offset higher
currency volatility. Bond buyers will also focus more on  credit
quality  due to reduced appreciation expectations. That said,
this change in market dynamic is beneficial to the development
of a healthy Dim Sum bond market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
