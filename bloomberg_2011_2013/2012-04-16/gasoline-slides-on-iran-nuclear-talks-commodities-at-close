time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials lost 0.9
percent to 1,562.372.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline fell the most in six weeks as international talks
with  Iran  on April 14 over its nuclear program resulted in an
agreement to reconvene in May, easing concern that crude
supplies will be disrupted.  Gasoline dropped 2.4 percent, following Brent lower after
the two lead negotiators,  Saeed Jalili , Iran’s nuclear envoy,
and the European Union’s foreign policy chief,  Catherine Ashton ,
called the talks constructive. Gasoline and Brent have risen
this year as tension with Iran escalated and the U.S. and EU
imposed sanctions on that country’s oil exports.  Gasoline for May delivery fell 7.91 cents to settle at

percent, to settle at $3.1166 a gallon, the first loss in four
trading days.  CRUDE OIL  Oil rose as the reversal date for the Seaway crude pipeline
was moved up, causing the spread between New York-traded futures

Texas Intermediate crude and Brent was the smallest since
February, narrowing to $15.31.  Crude for May delivery gained 10 cents to settle at $102.93

or 2.1 percent, to $118.68 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures  Europe  exchange.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures declined for a second straight session in New

metal as a safe haven.  Gold for June delivery slid 0.6 percent to settle at
$1,649.70 an ounce at 1:43 p.m. on the Comex in New York. The
precious metal has retreated 1.3 percent this month.  Silver futures for May delivery on the Comex fell 1.7 cents
to $31.373 an ounce.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas rose for the first time in five days as the
outlook for cooler-than-normal weather in late April signaled
increased demand for the heating and power-plant fuel.  Gas gained 1.8 percent as temperatures will be below-normal
over the next six- to 10-day period, according to the  National
Weather Service . U.S. stockpiles ended March at a record level
for the month.  Natural gas for May delivery rose 3.5 cents, or 1.8

prospects in the Great Plains and Midwest.  Wheat futures for July delivery fell 1.4 percent to close
