U.S. Representative Edolphus Towns,
a New York Democrat, said today he won’t seek re-election this
year.  Towns, a former chairman of the Oversight and Government
Reform Committee, announced his decision in a statement on his
website. Towns, 77, said he made the decision to retire “after
months of long family discussions.” He said, “I believe firmly
that we would have won a 16th term had we decided to run.”  Towns announced his retirement on the last day for
potential candidates to file for the June 26 Democratic primary,
where he faced opposition from state Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries
and New York City Councilman Charles Barron.  The Brooklyn congressional district is overwhelmingly
Democratic, so the winner of the primary is all but assured of
victory in the general election.  The announcement brings the tally of House Democrats who
won’t be defending their seats in November to 24, compared with
20 House Republicans. Those lawmakers include California
Republican David Dreier, chairman of the Rules Committee, and
New York Democrat Gary Ackerman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
