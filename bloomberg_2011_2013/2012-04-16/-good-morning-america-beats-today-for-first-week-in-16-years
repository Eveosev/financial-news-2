ABC’s “ Good Morning America ”
attracted an average of 5.15 million daily viewers last week,
beating NBC’s “Today” show for the first time in more than 16
years.  “Good Morning America” outdrew “ Today ” by 13,000
viewers for the week of April 9, according to a statement today
from  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC, which cited preliminary Nielsen
data.  “This is an exciting day but we will save any celebrating
for when the final numbers come in on Thursday,” Tom Cibrowski,
senior executive producer, said in the statement.  The ABC program, which hasn’t led in the weekly ratings
since December 1995, is hosted by Robin Roberts and George Stephanopoulos. “Today” still led by 254,000 viewers in a
demographic important to advertisers, those 25 to 54 years old,
NBC said in an e-mailed statement.  The NBC show’s “852-week winning streak had taken on a
life of its own and as odd as it is to see it end, we should
acknowledge just how remarkable it has been,” the show’s
executive producer, Jim Bell, said in the statement. “So as we
tip our caps to the team at ‘Good Morning America,’ we can also
take a bow ourselves and recognize the work done by countless
staffers for so long.”  Disney fell 0.5 percent to $41.66 at the close in  New York 
and has gained 11 percent this year. NBC’s majority owner,
 Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , rose 0.9 percent to $29.77 and is up 26 percent
in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
