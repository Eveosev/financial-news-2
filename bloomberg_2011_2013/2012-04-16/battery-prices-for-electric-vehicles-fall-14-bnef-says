The average price of lithium-ion
battery packs for  electric vehicles  fell 14 percent in the past
year as production capacity exceeded demand, Bloomberg New
Energy Finance said.  Batteries cost $689 a kilowatt-hour in the first quarter of
2012, compared with $800 a year earlier, the London-based
research company said today in a statement.  Prices for batteries have dropped 30 percent since 2009,
making electric vehicles less expensive.  “Batteries are one of the biggest drivers of the cost of
electric vehicles,” New Energy Finance Chief Executive Officer
Michael Liebreich said in the statement. “A sharp decline in
price may be unwelcome for battery manufacturers, but it is
essential for the long-term health of the sector.”  Electric vehicles such as  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211) ’s i-MiEV,
 Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ’s Leaf and  Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) ’s Model S require
between 16 kilowatt-hours and 85 kilowatt-hours of storage,
which accounts for about 25 percent of their cost, New Energy
Finance said.  The industry has capacity to produce about 10 gigawatt-
hours of battery packs more than it needs now, enough for
400,000 all-electric vehicles, and that surplus may reach 17
gigawatt-hours by the end of 2013. Battery prices may drop to
about $150 a kilowatt-hour by 2030, New Energy Finance said.  About 43,000 electric vehicles were sold in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
