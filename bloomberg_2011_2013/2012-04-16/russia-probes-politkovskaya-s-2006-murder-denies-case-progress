Russia continues its probe into the
murder of  Anna Politkovskaya  in 2006, the Investigative
Committee said, expressing “astonishment” at comments by the
 Interior Ministry  that the case is almost solved.  “At the current time it’s premature to talk about any time
frame for concluding the investigation,” the committee said in
a  statement  published on its website today.  Investigators are checking testimony provided by a former
police officer detained last year on suspicion of organizing the
reporter’s murder along with evidence from other witnesses “to
avoid wrongly charging someone with a crime,” according to the
statement. Russia is close to solving the murder, Interfax
reported today, citing the Interior Ministry.  Politkovskaya, a correspondent for the independent
newspaper  Novaya Gazeta , wrote about corruption under then-
President  Vladimir Putin  and chronicled abuses by security
forces in the mainly Muslim region of Chechnya. Her books
include “Putin’s Russia: Life in a Failing Democracy” and “A
Dirty War: A Russian Reporter in Chechnya.”  Nobody has been convicted of killing Politkovskaya, who was
shot in the head in her Moscow apartment building in 2006, on
Putin’s birthday. The U.S. government has urged Russia to find
the real culprits behind the murder of the reporter, who held
dual Russian-U.S. citizenship, after a Moscow jury acquitted
three men of involvement in the killing in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
