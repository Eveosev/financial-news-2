European officials travel to 
Washington this week seeking a bigger global war chest to 
combat the debt crisis as Spain’s government battles to quell 
renewed
market turmoil over its finances.  Three weeks after European leaders unveiled emergency 
euro-area funding exceeding the symbolic $1 trillion mark, 
concerns about Spain’s position have pushed the nation’s 
borrowing costs to the highest levels this year. 
Crisis-fighting resources will dominate talks at the 
International Monetary Fund’s spring meeting in Washington 
April 20-22. (Source: Bloomberg)  Running Time: 00:39
