 U.S. stocks reversed early gains
as  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG)  led a retreat in technology shares
that tempered an advance triggered by stronger-than-forecast
growth in retail sales.  Apple fell for a fifth straight day, losing 3 percent, and
Google slumped 2.8 percent.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index was little changed at
1,370.26 after climbing as much as 0.7 percent earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
