German medium-sized companies,
whose business confidence rose to a 20-year high, will create
180,000 new jobs by the end of the year, business information
service  Creditreform  said today, citing a survey.  Creditreform’s spring business sentiment measure for German
medium-sized companies rose to 55.4, the highest since
reunification in 1990, from 49.2 a year ago, the company said
today at a briefing in Berlin. A measure of hiring intentions
remained “expansive” even as it fell to 17.2 from 20.4.  “Confidence about the development of the German economy is
increasing,” Creditreform management board member Helmut Roedl
told reporters. “Medium-sized companies are still very happy to
hire.”  More than one in five companies plan to hire while three
quarters plan to hold on to their workers and only 5 percent
plan to fire staff, Roedl said. Creditreform polled 4,053
companies in March and April, he said.  Hiring is driven by larger medium-sized companies with more
than 250 employees, where about 40 percent of respondents said
they want to hire. All branches of the economy plan to take on
staff, led by construction, Roedl said.  “The German medium-sized sector is decoupling itself from
the difficult economic environment in  Europe  and will continue
its upward trend in 2012,” Roedl said. “Sentiment couldn’t be
better.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
