Climate officials representing the
world’s top five carbon dioxide emitters  agreed  to work on a
platform for promoting research and sharing information on how
to cut emissions.  Japan  hosted a conference in Tokyo yesterday on sustainable
economic growth using less energy and emitting less greenhouse
gas with officials from 18 East Asia Summit member countries.
The members, including Russia and the U.S., account for about 63
percent of global emissions, according to the foreign ministry.  Officials discussed the importance of low-carbon
technologies, financial support and market mechanisms, according
to a statement by Japanese Foreign Minister Koichiro Gemba and
Rachmat Witoelar, Indonesian president’s special envoy for
 climate change  who co-chaired the meeting.  Gemba  proposed  considering a new market mechanism in his
speech yesterday. Japan has been pushing for a bilateral offset
credits mechanism to provide clean energy technologies to
developing countries. The five largest emitters are  China , the
U.S., India, Russia and Japan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
