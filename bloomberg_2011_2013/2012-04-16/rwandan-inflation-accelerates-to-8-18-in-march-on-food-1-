Rwanda ’s annual inflation rate
increased to 8.18 percent in March as food prices and utility
costs climbed, the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda
said.  Inflation accelerated from 7.85 percent in February, the
Kigali-based agency said in a statement on its website today.
Prices rose 2.2 percent in the month as food costs grew 4.4
percent and utilities advanced 2.6 percent, it said. Underlying
inflation, which excludes food and energy costs, rose 5.3
percent in the year and 0.4 percent in the month, it said.  Rwanda’s central bank left its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at 7 percent last month as it forecast inflation will
slow. The National Bank of Rwanda expects to reduce the
inflation rate to 7.4 percent by the end of June, Governor
Claver Gatete said on March 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
