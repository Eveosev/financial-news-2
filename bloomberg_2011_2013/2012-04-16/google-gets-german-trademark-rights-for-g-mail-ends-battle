Google Inc. (GOOG) , owner of the world’s
most-used Internet search engine, acquired the German rights to
the name “G-mail,” according to a filing at the nation’s
trademark office.  Google, which owns trademark rights to Gmail in more than
60 nations, has been fighting with German businessman Daniel Giersch who won the rights to “G-mail” in 2000. Giersch
prevented Google from registering “Gmail” with the European
Union’s trademark office in 2008. The dispute led to a series of
court cases after the  Mountain View , California-based company
started its e-mail service using the name “Gmail” in 2004.  Giersch didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.
Google spokesman Stefan Keuchel confirmed in an e-mail that the
German disputes have been ended.  The trademark transfer was reported by the CIO website
earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
