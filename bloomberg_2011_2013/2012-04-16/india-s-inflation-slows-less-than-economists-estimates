India ’s inflation slowed less
than estimated in March as food and fuel prices rose,
limiting room for cuts in  interest rates  to bolster a
weakening economy.  The benchmark wholesale-price  index  advanced 6.89
percent from a year earlier, the commerce ministry said in a
statement in New Delhi today, compared with a 6.95 percent
climb in February and the median 6.65 percent estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 33 economists.  The  Reserve Bank of India , which reviews policy tomorrow,
has signaled readiness to lower borrowing costs for the first
time since 2009 to boost domestic demand as  Europe ’s debt
crisis and a slowdown in  China  dim the global outlook. It has
also flagged the risk of a revival in price pressures because
of the rupee’s slide, costlier oil and the fiscal gap.  “Inflation worryingly could be sticky, and the recent
comments by the RBI suggest it is growing more and more
concerned by downside risks,” said  Vishnu Varathan , an
economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  Singapore . The
central bank will move “gradually” and cut no more than 25
basis points at any one meeting and 100 basis points in total
in the year through March, he said.  Rupee, Bonds  India’s rupee, which tumbled 16 percent last year as
growth decelerated and the nation’s trade gap widened, fell
0.7 percent to 51.665 per dollar as of 12:09 p.m. local time.
The BSE India Sensitive Index was little changed. The yield
on the 8.79 percent note due November 2021 advanced 1 basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.46 percent from 8.45
percent before the release.  Seventeen of 25 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
expect the monetary authority to reduce  borrowing costs  by
0.25 percentage point to 8.25 percent on April 17, while
three foresee a 50 basis points cut.  Five predict India will keep rates unchanged for a
fourth straight meeting, joining neighbors from  Pakistan  to
Indonesia in leaving them on hold as it juggles growth risks
with price pressures.  While inflation has eased from more than 9 percent for
most of 2011, it remains the fastest among the so-called BRIC
group of biggest emerging economies that also includes Brazil,
Russia and China.  Food, Fuel Prices  The price of vegetables surged 30.57 percent in March
from a year earlier, today’s report showed. Egg, meat and
fish costs climbed 17.71 percent. Fuel and power prices rose
10.41 percent. Manufacturing inflation slowed to 4.87 percent
from 5.75 percent in February.  Central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao has already
reduced the amount of deposits lenders must set aside as
reserves twice in 2012 to alleviate a cash squeeze that
threatens growth.  Asia ’s third-largest economy expanded 6.1 percent in the
fourth quarter, close to a three-year low, hurt by declining
investment and moderating  consumer spending  after the  Reserve
Bank  raised rates by a record 3.75 percentage points from
March 2010 to October last year to fight inflation.  Passenger car sales grew at the slowest pace in three
years in the 12 months through March as costlier credit
crimped demand for products by automakers such as Maruti
Suzuki India Ltd., maker of almost half the cars sold in the
country.  Singh’s Challenge  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s government is facing one
of the most  challenging  periods since taking office in 2004,
as it grapples with fiscal and trade gaps and depressed
industrial output.  In the budget on March 16, the administration announced
record borrowing needs to plug a fiscal shortfall estimated
at 5.1 percent of gross domestic product in 2012-2013.  The excess of imports over exports in 2011-2012 was
about $185 billion, Commerce Minister  Anand Sharma  said last
week. A report on April 12 showed industrial output rose a
less-than-estimated 4.1 percent in February from a year ago.  Policy reversals have further hindered Singh’s economic
agenda, including the suspension in December of plans to open
India’s retail industry to foreign companies such as Wal-Mart
Stores Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
