 A  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  plane was
given the all clear by Irish police after it made an emergency
landing at Dublin airport because of concern about an object on
the flight.  The Delta 767-300 plane, which was en route from Istanbul
to New York JFK airport, landed in Dublin at 4 p.m. local time
after the pilot requested permission to make an emergency
landing, the Irish Times reported on its website.  “There was some concern about an object on board, but it
has been given the all clear,” said the spokesman, who declined
to be named in line with Irish police policy.    To contact the reporter on this story:
