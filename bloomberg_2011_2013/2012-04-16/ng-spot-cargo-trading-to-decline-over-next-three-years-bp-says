BP Plc (BP/)  said trading of liquefied
natural gas cargoes on the  spot market  will decline over the
next three years.  “Liquidity for LNG trading could fall,” Jonty Shepard,
head of LNG trading at BP, said today at the Flame conference in
Amsterdam. “Spot trading is likely to decline in the next three
years if LNG tightens significantly.”  A slowdown in new supply, rising demand for gas cargoes in
Asia and more potential demand in Europe as domestic production
declines will reduce spare shipments for trading, he said.  The LNG market has become more sophisticated in recent
years, Shepard said, pointing to a total of 48 cargoes that were
“reloaded” from  storage tanks  at import terminals in 2011,
compared with five in 2009.  Buyers will become more nervous about securing shipments
and will try to “lock in mid-term deals,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
