Twitter Inc. will “aggressively”
add sales staff in  Japan  to attract more advertisers as local
user growth exceeds the company’s global expansion, Chief
Executive Officer  Dick Costolo  said.  The microblogging service will continue to invest and hire
in Japan and will also add engineers, Costolo told reporters in
 Tokyo  today, without specifying investment amounts or the number
of people being added.  The San Francisco-based company, which lets users post 140-
character messages, is expanding abroad to decrease its reliance
on the U.S. market. The percentage of revenue Twitter earns from
the U.S. will fall to 83 percent in 2014 from about 90 percent
this year, researcher EMarketer estimated in January.  Japan had the third-largest share of Twitter users with
29.9 million accounts created before Jan. 1, according to
 Semiocast , a social-media research company. The U.S. had 107.7
million accounts and  Brazil  had 33.3 million, according to the
Paris-based researcher. Japanese was the most-used language on
Twitter after English, Semiocast said.  Twitter has 140 million active users globally, Costolo said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
