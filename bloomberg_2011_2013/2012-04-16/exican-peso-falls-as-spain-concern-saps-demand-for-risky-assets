Mexico ’s peso declined for a second
day as mounting concern over Spain’s ability to meet its
financing needs discouraged demand for higher-yielding assets.  The peso fell 0.3 percent to 13.2129 per U.S. dollar at 4
p.m. in Mexico City, from 13.1775 on April 13. The currency has
gained 5.5 percent this year.  Spain’s Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said his country must
slash its budget deficit to maintain access to financing. The
peso earlier recouped losses after a report showed retail sales
in the U.S., the destination for 80 percent of Mexican exports,
rose more than forecast in March. Concern over Europe’s debt
crisis helped make the currency Latin America’s worst-performing
currency last year.  “It seems that concerns about Spain will take a long time
to be digested by the market, and the  Mexican peso  is one of the
barometers of these rising pressures,”  Benito Berber , a
strategist for Latin America at Nomura Securities Inc., said in
a phone interview from New York.  The yield on Mexico’s peso-denominated bonds due in 2024
rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.31
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell
0.25 centavo to 132.07 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
