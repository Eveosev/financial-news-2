James Shields  struck out five
batters in 8 1/3 innings as the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Boston
Red Sox 1-0 this afternoon on the Patriots’ Day holiday at
Fenway Park.  Shields allowed four hits and two walks before leaving with
one out in the bottom of the ninth inning. The Rays scored the
game’s only run in the top of the seventh inning when Red Sox
pitcher  Daniel Bard , making his second career start, walked Evan Longoria with the bases loaded.  Rays outfielder Desmond Jennings had a team-high two hits
and a stolen base, and Fernando Rodney got the final two outs in
the win, Tampa’s first in its last five games.  Cody Ross  led the
 Red Sox  with two hits before striking out looking with two men
on base to end the game.  The Red Sox are 67-50 on Patriots’ Day, which coincides
each year with the running of the Boston Marathon, won earlier
today by Wesley Korir and Sharon Cherop of Kenya. The holiday
commemorates the Battles of Lexington and Concord from the
Revolutionary War.  Boston opened the season 1-5 and then won three games,
outscoring the Rays by a combined 31-11. The loss moves the Red
Sox to 4-6, alone in last place in the American League East
division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
