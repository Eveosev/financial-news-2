Daimler AG (DAI)  unveiled the Mercedes-
Benz Citan delivery van, marking the first vehicle to result
from two years of cooperation with  Renault SA. (RNO)   The Citan shares technology with the Renault Kangoo and
will go on sale this fall, the Stuttgart, Germany-based
automaker said today in a statement. Mercedes aims for the model
to win a share of 4 percent to 5 percent of the European small-
van segment, which totals about 700,000 vehicles a year. The van
will compete with  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Caddy and other vehicles.  “The Citan has the stuff to become a hero of the cities,”
Volker Mornhinweg, head of Daimler’s Mercedes Vans division,
said in a speech today in Amsterdam. “We tested its heart and
kidneys just like we test every other Mercedes.”  Daimler and the Renault-Nissan alliance agreed in April
2010 to swap shareholdings to secure a partnership aimed at
cutting costs. In addition to the van project, the manufacturers
will share development of next-generation models of Daimler’s
Smart and the Twingo made by Renault, based in the Paris suburb
of Boulogne-Billancourt. Nissan’s Infiniti brand may also use
small-car technology from Mercedes.  The Citan adds a vehicle designed for inner-city deliveries
to Mercedes’s van lineup, which includes the larger Vito and
Sprinter models. The Daimler  division  increased sales 18 percent
to 264,000 vehicles last year and is targeting more than 400,000
deliveries by 2015 as it expands outside  Europe .  The new van will come in three sizes and will also be
available in Turkey and  Australia , Daimler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
