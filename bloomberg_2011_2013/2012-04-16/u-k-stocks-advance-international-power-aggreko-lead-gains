U.K. stocks  advanced, rebounding
from four consecutive weeks of losses, as gains in  International
Power Plc (IPR)  overshadowed declines in bank shares.  International Power jumped 3.2 percent after GDF Suez SA
raised its offer to buy the 30 percent stake in the company that
it doesn’t already own.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  led a drop in
financial stocks as Spanish bond yields rose to a four-month
high.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  increased 0.3 percent to 5,666.28 at the
close in London. The benchmark gauge has still lost 5 percent
since its 2012 high on March 16. The broader  FTSE All-Share
Index (ASX)  climbed 0.2 percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index added 0.3
percent.  “The market is making a pause after last week’s
declines,” said Bruno Ducros, a  fund manager  at CamGestion in
Paris, which oversees about $4 billion in stocks. “All the
better, but I’m not sure it will last. We expect volatility
until  Spain ’s bond sale on Thursday.”  Spain will sell 2014 bonds with a 3.3 percent coupon and
2022 bonds with 5.85 percent coupon on Thursday.  European stocks dropped for a fourth week last week, the
longest streak of losses since August, as concern resurfaced
about the region’s debt crisis and economic reports in China and
the U.S. missed estimates.  Stocks gained today after a report showed U.S. retail sales
rose more than forecast in March. The 0.8 percent gain the
consumer reading exceeded the 0.3 percent advance projected in a
Bloomberg survey and followed a revised 1 percent increase in
February, Commerce Department figures showed.  GDF Suez Offer  International Power advanced 3.2 percent to 416.8 pence.
GDF Suez, Europe’s biggest utility by market value, agreed to
buy the remaining 30 percent stake in the company for 6.4
billion pounds ($10 billion). The revised bid of 418 pence a
share is 7 percent more than an earlier offer of 390 pence that
was rejected as too low this month.  Lloyds lost 3.4 percent to 29.71 pence.  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  retreated 3.1 percent to 24.27 pence.  Spain’s  10-year (GSPG10YR)  yield advanced to 6.07 percent. It earlier
reached 6.16 percent, the most since Dec. 1. European and U.S.
equities sank on April 13 after Spanish benchmark yields edged
toward 6 percent, reigniting concern that the euro area’s debt
crisis will worsen. China also reported economic growth the same
day that slowed more than forecast. Asian stocks extended the
global selloff today.  Diageo, Croda  Diageo Plc (DGE) , the world’s biggest liquor maker, rallied 1.6
percent to 1,543.5 pence. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
buying the stock.  Croda International Plc (CRDA) , the world’s second-largest maker
of cosmetic ingredients, climbed 2.7 percent to 2,190 pence.
Berenberg Bank AG advised buying the shares before the
publication of quarterly results.  Oxford BioMedica Plc (OXB)  jumped 41 percent to 5.8 pence,
climbing for a third day in London after the U.K. company said
the ProSavin treatment for  Parkinson’s disease  met the main goal
of a clinical trial.  The Phase I/II clinical trial assessed the safety, efficacy
and dosing of the treatment, Oxford, England-based Oxford
BioMedica said.  Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP)  slid 4.6 percent to 129.5 pence. The
producer of the metal in southern Africa fell as Zimbabwe
ordered mining companies to reapply for exploration rights.  Zimbabwe ordered 469 local and foreign companies to refile
applications for exploration rights that detail their holding,
proof of funding and technical capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
