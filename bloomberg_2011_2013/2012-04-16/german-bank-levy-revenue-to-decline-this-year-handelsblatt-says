German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  expects the bank levy introduced in 2011 to generate
less in 2012 than it did last year,   Handelsblatt  reported,
citing a letter to lawmakers.  Revenue from the levy probably will drop to 500 million
euros ($657 million) in 2012 from 590 million euros a year
earlier because of weaker economic growth as a result of the
region’s debt crisis and banks’ writedowns on their exposure to
 Greece , Handelsblatt said.  The government forecast in 2010 that the levy would produce
1.3 billion euros in revenue annually, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
