State-run OAO Transneft and OAO
Rosneft asked the government to sell a 20 percent stake in OAO
Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port to Rosneft,  Vedomosti  reported,
citing a letter from the companies to Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin .  Transneft, which is already a shareholder in the port,
doesn’t want privately help Summa Group, its partner in the
port, to gain control, on the ground that it might be against
 Russia ’s strategic interests, the newspaper said, citing the
letter.  The state companies are also seeking to buy 5 percent of
the port held by  Russian Railways (RZHD) , Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
