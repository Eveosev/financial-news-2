The euro gained versus most of its
major counterparts, rebounding from a two-month low versus the
dollar, after U.S. retail sales rose more than forecast, buoying
demand for higher-yielding assets.  The 17-nation currency fell earlier below $1.30 for the
first time since February as Spanish  bond yields  touched a 2012
high, fueling concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is spreading.
Norway’s krone gained the most against the dollar as crude oil
rose. South  Korea ’s won was the biggest loser as the  Bank of
Korea  cut its 2012 economic growth forecast to 3.5 percent, from
3.7 percent.  “You’ve seen the turnaround in stocks, so you have that
correlation,” said David Grad, a foreign-exchange strategist at
Bank of America Corp. in New York. “Euro concern is definitely
back. Euro downside has been very popular, and so breaking back
above $1.31 was probably technical.”  The euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.3142 at 4:43 p.m. in New
York after falling earlier to as low as $1.2995, the weakest
level since Feb. 16. It was down 0.2 percent to 105.67 yen after
dropping to as low as 104.63, the weakest since Feb. 20.  Japan ’s
currency gained 0.7 percent to 80.41 to the dollar.  The Norwegian krone appreciated 0.7 percent to 5.7458 per
dollar. Norway is the world’s seventh-biggest oil exporter. The
South Korean won weakened 0.3 percent to 1,138.63 to the dollar
in its first decline in three days.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 0.6 percent. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index ended the day little changed after
falling earlier as much as 0.4 percent. Crude oil for May
delivery gained as much as 0.5 percent to $103.37 a barrel in
New York before trading at $103.13, up 0.3 percent.  Retail Sales  U.S.  retail sales  increased 0.8 percent in March, following
a revised 1 percent advance in February, Commerce Department
figures showed today in  Washington . The median forecast of 81
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for an advance of 0.3
percent.  The euro slid earlier against the yen and the dollar after
the cost of insuring Spain’s debt reached a record and Jaime Garcia-Legaz, the nation’s deputy economy minister, said in an
interview on April 13 the  European Central Bank  should “step up
purchases of bonds.”  Spanish 10-year  bond yields  jumped as much as 18 basis
points, or 0.18 percentage point, to 6.16 percent, the highest
level since Dec. 1, before trading at 6.06 percent. Five-year
credit-default swaps linked to Spanish bonds jumped to an all-
time high of 521, CMA data show.  Spanish Debt Sales  Spain  will sell 12- and 18-month bills tomorrow, followed
by auctions on April 19 of debt maturing in October 2014 and
January 2022.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is struggling to convince
investors he can get Spain’s finances under control after last
month refusing to meet deficit targets set by the European
Commission and the previous government.  Italian 10-year bond yields reached 5.67 percent,
approaching a two-month high.  “The market is growing increasingly nervous about Spain
and  Italy  in particular,” said  Omer Esiner , chief market
analyst in Washington at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc., a
currency brokerage.  The euro lost 5.7 percent over the past year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes, the worst performer
among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by the gauges.
The yen gained 6.5 percent, and the dollar rose 4.3 percent.  The dollar rose earlier as the U.S. retail sales data
damped speculation the  Federal Reserve  will add to monetary
easing.  Fed Policy Makers  Four members of the  Federal Open Market Committee  judged
that monetary policy should be tightened from 2015, while two
preferred 2016, according to a Jan. 25 statement from the Fed.
The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of bonds from 2008 to 2011
in two rounds of quantitative easing. The FOMC begins a two-day
policy meeting on April 24.  The euro may fall to as low as $1.2805 after breaking below
a key level of support today, according to Credit Suisse AG.  The currency is poised to weaken to the 78.6 percent
Fibonacci retracement of its rally in the first quarter after
declining through the so-called head-and-shoulders neckline at
$1.3030, Steve Miley, director of technical analysis in  London ,
said in a telephone interview.  Support refers to an area where buy orders may be
clustered. A head and shoulders is formed when a currency makes
three consecutive peaks, with the middle being the highest. A
neckline is drawn across the base of the three peaks. Fibonacci
analysis is based on the theory that prices rise or fall by
certain percentages after reaching a high or low.  To contact the reporters on this story:
