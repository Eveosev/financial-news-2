Soybean growers in  Brazil , the
world’s second-largest producer after the U.S., harvested 86
percent of the current crop as of April 13, down from 87 percent
a year earlier, crop researcher AgRural Commodities Agricolas
said.  The outlook for the country’s soybean output in the crop
year that started Sept. 1 was maintained at 66.7 million metric
tons, Curitiba, Brazil-based AgRural said in an e-mailed report
today.  Output of the oilseed will be less than the 75.3 million
tons reaped in the previous harvest and the 73.1 million tons
estimated initially for the current crop before dry weather
damaged fields in southern Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
