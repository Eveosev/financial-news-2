The euro region’s  trade surplus 
narrowed more than economists estimated in February as increased
demand for imported goods outpaced exports.  The surplus shrank to a seasonally adjusted 3.7 billion
euros ($4.8 billion) from a revised 5.3 billion euros in
January, the European Union’s  statistics office  in Luxembourg
said today. Economists had forecast a drop to 5 billion euros,
the median of eight projections in a Bloomberg News survey
showed. Imports increased 3.5 percent in the month, while
exports were up 2.4 percent.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said on April
4 that, while economic-growth indicators had “broadly
stabilized at low levels” after a 0.3 percent contraction in
the fourth quarter, the outlook “remains subject to downside
risks.” The European Commission forecasts a 0.3 percent
contraction in 2012.  The euro was little changed after the data were released,
trading at $1.3014 at 11:10 a.m. in Brussels, down 0.5 percent.  In Germany,  Europe ’s largest economy, imports grew 3
percent in February, exports increased 1.4 percent and the  trade
surplus  narrowed 3 percent to 10.5 billion euros,  today’s report 
showed. France reported a surplus of 900 million euros, while
Italy’s trade deficit shrank to 1.2 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
