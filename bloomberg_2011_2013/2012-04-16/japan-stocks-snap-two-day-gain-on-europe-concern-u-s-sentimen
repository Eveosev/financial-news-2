     April 16 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  fell, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average falling the most in about two weeks,
after the rising cost of insuring against a Spanish default
signaled concern Europe’s debt crisis is spreading and U.S.
consumer confidence dropped, hurting exporters’ prospects.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that relies on Europe and the
Americas for nearly 60 percent of sales, fell 2.4 percent.
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender by
market value, followed a global drop in banking shares amid
concern the European debt crisis may hurt the world financial
system. Apparel maker TSI Holdings Co. slumped 11 percent after
forecasting a loss.  The Nikkei 225 dropped 1.7 percent to 9,470.64 at the 3 p.m.
trading close in  Tokyo , its biggest loss since April 4. About
five stocks declined for each that gained on the gauge. The
broader Topix Index fell 1.4 percent to 803.83 after losing 1.2
percent last week. Twenty eight of the 33 industry groups on the
gauge fell today.  “A rescue for Spain would be huge if it actually happens,
and it could make the crisis worse than last year,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee the equivalent of about $22 billion
as chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.
“The market may fall into a downtrend if the Nikkei can’t
rebound to about 9,800 yen.”  The Nikkei 225  gained  12 percent this year on signs of
strength in the U.S. economy and policy easing around the world,
including the Bank of Japan’s extension of government bond
purchases.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  fell 0.2 percent
today. The gauge lost 1.3 percent in  New York  on April 13,
capping its first back-to-back weekly decline since November, as
confidence among U.S. consumers cooled in April from a one-year
high.  Spain Debt Concern  Stocks also fell after five-year credit-default swaps for
Spain surged to a record as Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy
struggles to prevent the nation from becoming the fourth euro-
region member to need a bailout. The euro capped its second
weekly loss against the yen last week, hurting the earnings
outlook of Japanese companies that export to the region.  “Concern is mounting about the Spanish bond sales this
week, with yields rising and credit-default swaps extending a
record,” said Toshiyuki Kanayama, a market analyst at Tokyo-
based Monex Inc.  Companies that do business in in the U.S. and  Europe  fell.
Canon lost 2.4 percent to 3,700 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , a
carmaker that counts  North America  as its biggest market,
declined 1.7 percent to 3,270 yen.  Nintendo Co. (7974) , a maker of
gaming consoles that generates 41 percent of its sales in Europe,
dropped 3.2 percent to 11,220 yen.  Banking Stocks Drop  Financial shares fell ahead of European officials’ trip to
 Washington  this week in search of a larger global war chest to
fight the region’s debt crisis. The matter is expected to
dominate talks at the International Monetary Fund’s spring
meeting in Washington from April 20-22.  Mitsubishi UFJ slid 3.5 percent to 388 yen.  Mizuho
Financial Group Inc. (8411) ,  Japan ’s third-largest bank by market value,
fell 3.1 percent to 127 yen.  Among other declining stocks, TSI Holdings slumped 11
percent to 445 yen after forecasting a loss of 3.3 billion yen
($41 million) for the year ending February 2013, citing an
uncertain economic outlook. The company reported a 27.2 billion
yen loss for the year ended in February 2012, according to a
statement.  Pasco Corp., a survey company specializing in aerial
photography, dropped 4.7 percent to 305 yen. The surveyor said
there was a “high possibility” 799.3 million yen of software-
related costs incurred in October were booked as assets.  The Nikkei 225 Volatility Index added 9.1 percent to 21.43,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.1 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume was 26
percent below the 30-day average.  Shares on the Topix are  valued  at one times book value,
compared with 2.2 times for the S&P 500 and 1.4 times for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index. A number below one means that investors
can buy companies for less than the value of their assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
