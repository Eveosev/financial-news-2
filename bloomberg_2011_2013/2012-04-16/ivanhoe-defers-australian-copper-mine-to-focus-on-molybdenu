Ivanhoe Australia Ltd. (IVA) , a unit of
billionaire Robert Friedland’s Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., will defer a
copper development in Queensland to focus on other projects
including the Merlin molybdenum deposit in the state.  The outcome of a pre-feasibility study on the Mount Dore
copper cathode project showed further analysis is required,
while the estimated capital cost for the project has increased,
Ivanhoe  Australia  said today in a statement. Ivanhoe Mines owns
the $6 billion Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine in  Mongolia .  “Finalization of the pre-feasibility study will be
deferred until further testwork has been concluded,” Ivanhoe
said. The company will focus on advancing the Osborne copper and
gold mine, the Merlin molybdenum and rhenium project and the
Mount Elliott copper and gold project, it said.  The Merlin molybdenum and rhenium project in northwestern
Queensland will initially cost A$345 million ($356 million) and
is estimated to produce 5,100 tons of molybdenum and 7,300
kilograms of rhenium annually for the first seven years
following ramp-ups, Ivanhoe said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
