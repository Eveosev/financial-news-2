Recoveries after a financial crisis
are usually slow because the economy needs to work off excess
credit, the  Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco  said.  “Any forecast that assumes the recovery from the Great
Recession will resemble previous post-World War II recoveries
runs the risk of overstating future economic growth, lending
activity,  interest rates , investment, and inflation,” Oscar Jorda, a research adviser at the district bank, said in a report
today. The report refers to the economic performance of 14
advanced economies over 140 years.  “Compared with the average U.S. post-World War II
recession, the forecast for real GDP should be lowered 0.6-0.8
percentage point in 2012, 0.5-0.7 percentage point in 2013,
finally returning almost to normal by 2014,” he said, referring
to gross domestic product.  Employment today is about 10 percent lower than on average
after other postwar recessions, while investment is down 30
percent, according to the report. Forecasters should also revise
down their inflation projections by as much as a percentage
point over the next three years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
