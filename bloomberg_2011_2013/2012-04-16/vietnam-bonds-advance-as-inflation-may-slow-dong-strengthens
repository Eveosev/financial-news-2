Vietnam ’s five-year bonds rose on
speculation inflation will ease this month, allowing the central
bank to continue cutting  interest rates . The dong snapped a
five-day decline.  Slowing  consumer-price gains  may give policy makers room to
lower borrowing costs by 100 basis points in the second, third
and fourth quarters, central bank Governor Nguyen Van Binh said
last month. The monetary authority cut its repurchase rate to 12
percent from 13 percent on April 11, the second reduction in a
less than a month, and trimmed its refinancing and discount
rates by a percentage point each. Inflation slowed to a one-year
low of 14.15 percent in March, government data show.  “The market expects the  consumer price index  to be lower
this month,” said Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho Chi Minh City-based
analyst at Viet Capital Securities. “That’s why yields are
coming down.”  The  yield  on the government’s five-year notes declined one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 11.21 percent
according to a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate has dropped 27 basis points this month.  The dong advanced 0.4 percent to 20,843 per dollar as of
3:24 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That was the biggest gain since April 4. The central bank set
the  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according
to its website. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent
on either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
