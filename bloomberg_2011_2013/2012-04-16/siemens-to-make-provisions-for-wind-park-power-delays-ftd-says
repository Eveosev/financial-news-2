Siemens AG (SIE)  will allocate provisions
for the three months ended March against potential losses from
delays in connecting offshore wind parks to the  power grid ,
 Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing unidentified
people.  The provisions will be comparable to the 203 million euros
($267 million) set aside in the previous quarter, the newspaper
said. The company will revise a forecast for net income from
continuing operations of about 6 billion euros for the year
ending Sept. 30 when it releases quarterly figures on April 25,
FTD said.  Udo Niehage, head of Siemensâ€™s power transmission unit,
will leave the company, the newspaper added. Siemens declined to
comment, the FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
