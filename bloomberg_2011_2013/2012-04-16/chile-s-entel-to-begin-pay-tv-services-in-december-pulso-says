Empresa Nacional (ENDESA)  de
Telecomunicaciones SA,  Chile ’s second-largest mobile-telephone
operator, will begin offering pay-TV services in the South
American nation in December, Pulso  said .  Entel, as the company is also known, has signed an
agreement with Media Networks, a unit of  Spain ’s  Telefonica SA (TEF) ,
which will provide content for the services, the Santiago-based
newspaper wrote, without saying where it obtained the
information.  Entel will invest about $50 million to provide the
services, Pulso said.  An officer at Extend, Entel’s external corporate
communications services provider, didn’t immediately respond to
a phone call and e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
