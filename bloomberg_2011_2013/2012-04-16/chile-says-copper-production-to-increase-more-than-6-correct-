(Corrects comments on Chinese slowdown in second
paragraph.)  Chilean copper production probably
will rise more than 6 percent this year compared with 2011,
Mining Minister Hernan de Solminihac told reporters today.  Copper prices should remain around current levels because
of supply shortages, he said. Slowing Chinese demand probably
won’t “influence” the market in the short term, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
