Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo urged major central banks to plan an orderly withdrawal of
excess liquidity and said that further easing may hurt emerging
economies and the global economic recovery.  Extra loosening “could do more harm than good when the
financial markets are already flooded with cheap liquidity but
remain nonetheless timid in their lending to the private
sector,” Kim said in a speech prepared for a lecture at Goethe
University in  Frankfurt ,  Germany .  Monetary easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the
 European Central Bank  has been “highly correlated” with
capital inflows and exchange-rate volatility for emerging
economies, Kim said. Financial “spillovers” from advanced
economies pose risks to investment and growth for nations
including  South Korea , he said.  Some investors, including  Bill Gross , manager of the
world’s biggest bond fund at Pacific Investment Management Co.,
are betting that the Fed will embark on a third round of large-
scale asset purchases as the U.S. struggles with elevated
unemployment. In its first two rounds, the Fed bought $2.3
trillion of bonds from December 2008 to June to avert deflation
and spur growth.  “An orderly withdrawal of the current excess liquidity
should be pre-planned by major central banks,” Kim said.  He said “prudent and coordinated” management of global
liquidity and enhanced surveillance of capital flows could aid
global growth by shielding developing economies from potential
shocks related to volatility in capital flows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
