KazMunaiGas Exploration Production (RDGZ) ,
the London-listed unit of  Kazakhstan ’s state energy company,
said first-quarter oil output fell 5 percent from a year earlier
as adverse weather impeded operations.  Production was 3.029 million metric tons of crude, 143,000
tons less than in the first quarter of 2011, the Astana-based
producer said today in a statement distributed by the Regulatory
News Service.  Most of the decline was attributable to KazMunaiGas EP’s
Uzenmunaigas unit in the west of the country, the company said.
The initial 2012 production targets for the Uzenmunaigas and
Embamunaigas divisions have been set at 5.8 million tons and 2.8
million tons respectively, it said.  “The results of the second quarter will serve as an
indicator whether KazMunaiGas EP will need to adjust its 2012
production forecasts,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
