New Jersey (STONJ1) ’s casino tax revenue
continued to drop in March as the state collected 12 percent
less than a year earlier, the Treasurer said.  Collections from the largest sources of state revenue were
1.5 percent below March 2011. For the first nine months of the
fiscal year that began July 1, revenue rose 3.6 percent, to
almost $16.1 billion, Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff, the state’s
treasurer, said in a statement.  Gambling-related revenue from  Atlantic City , the second-
largest U.S. casino market after  Las Vegas , amounted to $18.5
million, trailing the $21.1 million collected a year earlier,
and 18 percent below Governor Chris Christie’s budget target.
For the first nine months of fiscal 2012, casino revenue was
about 14 percent less than the same period in 2011.  “Key indicators such as employment and car sales have
risen steadily during the last few few months, helping boost
 sales tax , income tax and other revenue,”  Charles Steindel , the
treasury department’s chief economist, said in the statement.
“March revenues were within 2.5 percent of the revised budget
after a strong February with the overall trend continuing to
favor economic growth.”  Collections for March missed Christie’s budget target by
$46.4 million, or 2.5 percent, according to the statement.
Income taxes lagged behind projections by $35.9 million, or 6.4
percent. Sales taxes fell short by 5 percent, and corporate
taxes were 3.9 percent below budget.  Revenue for the nine months ending in March fell about
$46.4 million short of targets, or 0.3 percent, according to the
statement. Income, sales and business taxes each were less than
1 percent below estimates in Christie’s budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
