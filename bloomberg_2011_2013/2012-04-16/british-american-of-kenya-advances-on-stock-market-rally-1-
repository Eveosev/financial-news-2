British-American Investments Co. (BRIT) , a
Kenyan company that owns money managers and insurance
businesses, headed for its biggest gain this year as share
prices improved for companies it’s invested in.  The stock jumped 6 percent, the biggest one-day advance
since Dec. 30, to 4.45 shillings by 1:53 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital.  British American reported a full-year pretax loss of 1.7
billion shillings ($20.4 million), compared with year-earlier
profit of 2.7 billion shillings, it said last month, citing the
“poor” performance of the stock market in 2011. The  Nairobi
Securities Exchange All Share Index (NSEASI)  is up 12 percent this year,
having plunged 30 percent in 2011.  “All the bad news is already out there” for the company,
Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard
Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today. “We
expect them to benefit from the current rally in some of the
counters they have invested in like  Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK)  and  Housing
Finance Ltd. (HFCL) ”  The two companies have gained 22 percent and 19 percent
respectively this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
