Treasuries snapped a gain from last
week before a government report that economists said will show
U.S. retail sales rose for a 10th month in March.  Treasuries have handed investors a 0.2 percent loss this
year as of April 13 as the world’s biggest economy shows signs
of improvement, based on Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index returned 9.6 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. U.S. government securities
revived in April as the European debt crisis increased demand
for the safest assets. Treasuries have returned 1.1 percent this
month, beating a 2.6 percent loss for the  S&P 500 .  “The economy is OK,” said Hiroki Shimazu, an economist in
 Tokyo  at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., a unit of  Japan ’s third-
largest publicly traded bank by assets. A continued recovery is
“bad for Treasuries. Investors should put their money in
equities as consumer demand grows.”  Benchmark 10-year notes  yielded  1.98 percent as of 11:48
a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2
percent security due in February 2022 changed hands at 100 5/32.  Shimazu revised his end-of-June forecast for 10-year yields
to 2.3 percent from 2.6 percent.  Retail sales probably rose 0.3 percent last month, after
gaining 1.1 percent in February, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of economists before the Commerce Department data today.
A separate report will show manufacturing in the New York region
grew, another survey showed.  Signs of Strengthening  The economy expanded “at a modest to moderate pace” from
mid-February through late March as manufacturing, hiring and
retail sales showed signs of strengthening, the  Federal Reserve 
said in its Beige Book report on April 11. The central bank has
pledged to keep its benchmark  interest rate  near zero until late
2014 to support the expansion.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices, has risen to 2.27 percentage points from
1.95 percentage points at the end of last year. The average over
the past decade is 2.14 percentage points.  Net purchases  of long-term notes, bonds and equities by
investors outside the U.S. probably fell to $40 billion in
February from $101 billion in January, based on a Bloomberg
survey of economists before the Treasury Department reports the
figure today.  Officials from  Europe  will travel to  Washington  this week
seeking a bigger global war chest to combat the region’s debt
crisis as  Spain ’s government battles to quell market turmoil
over its finances. The talks will be part of the International
Monetary Fund’s meeting in Washington April 20-22.  Spain is scheduled to sell 12- and 18-month bills tomorrow,
followed by April 19 auctions of debt due in 2014 and 2022.
Yields on the nation’s 10-year notes exceeded 6 percent on April
11, climbing toward the 7 percent level that pushed  Greece ,
Ireland and  Portugal  into rescues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
