Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  and  Enterprise
Products Partners LP (EPD)  plan to start crude oil shipments on the
Seaway pipeline from Cushing,  Oklahoma , to the U.S. Gulf Coast
on about May 17, according to a filing with regulators.  The initial transit time will be about 15 days on the
150,000-barrel-a-day line, said  Rick Rainey , a Houston-based
spokesman for Enterprise. The line will require about 2.5
million barrels of oil to fill.  The shipping duration will be reduced to about five days
after the line’s capacity is boosted to about 400,000 barrels
early next year, he said.  Uncommitted rates will be $3.82 a barrel for light crude
and $4.32 for heavy crude, according to a proposal subject to
approval from the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission .  “We are confident that the rates are just and
reasonable,” said Rainey. “This is designed to give the market
a little more guidance on what we are talking about in terms of
rates for committed shippers versus non-committed shippers.”  A request for market-based rates for uncommitted shippers
on the pipeline is still pending, he said.  Five-year committed agreements to ship light oil in volumes
less than 100,000 barrels a day will cost between $2.75 and $3 a
barrel. Ten-year agreements for the same grade of oil and the
same volume will cost between $2.50 and $2.75.  The  discount for West Texas Intermediate  for June delivery
compared with Brent narrowed $2.63 to $15.26 a barrel at 1:40
p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Committed Shipper Costs  The rate to ship more than 100,000 barrels a day of light
oil will cost $2 to $2.25 a barrel and a 10-year commitment is
required, the filing showed. Five-year commitments to ship heavy
oil on the pipeline will cost $3.25 to $3.50 to transport less
than 100,000 barrels a day.  “The committed shippers rates are slightly below the
market expectations of $3 per barrel,”  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston, said by phone.  Ten-year commitments to ship the same volume of heavy oil
on the line are $3 to $3.25 a barrel. The price to ship more
than 100,000 barrels a day of heavy oil is $2.35 to $2.75 a
barrel with a 10-year agreement.  Enbridge and Enterprise received enough shipper commitments
to increase the capacity of the Seaway pipeline by mid-2014,
according to a statement issued March 27. The companies will add
450,000 barrels a day to the pipeline, boosting the system’s
capacity to 850,000.  “As the Seaway system becomes operational and expands, the
market should see the Brent-WTI spread narrow substantially,”
Lipow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
