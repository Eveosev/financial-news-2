Tanzania’s inflation rate fell to
19 percent in March as energy and food-cost increases slowed,
the National Bureau of Statistics said.  The inflation rate dropped from 19.4 percent in February,
the Dar es Salaam-based agency said in a statement handed to
reporters today in the city. Prices climbed 1 percent in the
month in  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy, it said.  The annual increase in energy costs slowed to 29.4 percent
from 33.5 percent, while food-price growth dropped to 24.9
percent from 25.5 percent, according to the statement.  Tanzania may achieve single-digit inflation this year,
after the rate peaked at 19.8 percent in December driven by
increasing food and energy prices, according to the
International Monetary Fund.  “Based on a projected improvement in the food situation in
the region, headline inflation is projected to return to single
digits by end-2012,” the fund said on March 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
