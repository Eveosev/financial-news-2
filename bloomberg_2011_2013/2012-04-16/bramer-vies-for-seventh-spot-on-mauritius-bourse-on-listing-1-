Bramer Banking Corp. is set to
become the seventh-biggest company on the Stock Exchange of
Mauritius by market value after the merger between  Mauritius
Leasing Co. Ltd (MLC)  and Bramer Holding Co. Ltd.  The reference price will be set at 9.50 rupees per share on
May 9, Ashraf Esmael, chief executive officer of Mauritius
Leasing, said in a phone interview from  Port Louis , the capital,
today. “A shareholder of Bramer Banking Corp has undertaken to
make available 50,000 shares at that indicative price,” he
said.  Mauritius Leasing shareholders approved the merger today,
according to an e-mailed statement. The deal will be effective
as of May 2. Trading in the leasing company’s shares was
suspended on March 28, with a  closing price  of 10.50 rupees.  The merger will allow Bramer Banking to better compete with
Mauritius Commercial Bank and  State Bank  of Mauritius Ltd., the
Indian Ocean island nation’s two largest lenders, who currently
have a 40 percent weighting on the  SEMDEX (SEMDEX)  Index. Bramer Banking
will list about 9 million shares as from May 9, representing an
initial market value of 8.56 billion rupees ($294 milllion).
That would make it the seventh-largest company on the bourse,
according to today’s data.  The proposed introductory price of 9.50 rupees per share
should “not be the sole criterion in guiding the future
investment decisions” of shareholders following the listing,
