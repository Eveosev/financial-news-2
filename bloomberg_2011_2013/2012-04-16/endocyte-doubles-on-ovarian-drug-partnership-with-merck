Endocyte Inc. (ECYT)  shares more than
doubled after entering an agreement to develop its ovarian
cancer treatment with Merck & Co.  Endocyte  gained  $3.82 to $7.62 at 4 p.m. New York time, the
biggest jump since the shares began trading in February 2011.
The  West Lafayette , Indiana-based company had fallen 60 percent
in the past 12 months before today.  Merck will pay Endocyte $120 million upfront with as much
as $880 million in payments possible based on regulatory
approvals and sales, the companies said in a statement today.
The initial amount almost matches Endocyte’s $130 million market
value, based on April 13’s closing price.  Endocyte’s experimental treatment vintafolide is in the
third of three stages of testing usually required for approval
by U.S. regulators. The compound is also being tested for
treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.  The agreement gives  Merck (MRK)  worldwide rights to the medicine,
and it will split any profit from U.S. sales with Endocyte.
 Whitehouse Station , New Jersey-based Merck also gains rights to
develop the drug for other types of cancer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
