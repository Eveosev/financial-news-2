Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,
 Spain ’s second-biggest bank, named Mehmet Sezgin as head of
global payment systems.  Sezgin joins from Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS, the  Turkish
lender (GARAN)  in which BBVA holds a 25 percent stake, the Bilbao,
Spain-based bank said today in an e-mailed statement. He will
report to Jose Maria Garcia Meyer-Dohner, head of global retail
and business banking.  BBVA relies on payment systems for more than 10 percent of
gross income, the bank said. The bank is seeking to tap
Garanti’s expertise in Turkey to extend the use of payment
systems such as bank cards in markets such as Spain and Mexico,
Garcia Meyer-Dohner said in an interview.  As much as 32 percent of “all personal consumer
expenditure is done with cards in  Turkey , but that means there
is still 68 percent done in cash that we need to replace,” said
Sezgin, 49, who will be based in Istanbul and remain as co-
chairman of Garanti’s payment systems division. “Turkey is a
good example of putting cards into the hands of people and
getting merchants to employ these card transactions.”  The levels of card use for payments in Turkey compares with
about 16 percent in Spain and 7 percent in Mexico, the countries
that are the biggest contributors to BBVA’s earnings. Consumer
banking accounted for 81 percent of BBVA’s revenue in 2011.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
