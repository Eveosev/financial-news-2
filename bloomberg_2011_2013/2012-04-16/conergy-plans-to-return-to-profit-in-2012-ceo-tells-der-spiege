Conergy AG (CGYK) , a German solar-panel
maker, intends to post an operating profit this year after a
loss in 2011,  Der Spiegel  reported, citing an interview with
Chief Executive Officer Philip Comberg.  Conergy “made more money” than it spent in the first
quarter amid restructuring measures and “high” demand for
solar panels, Comberg told the German magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
