Slovenia’s financial system needs
to be strengthened after being “strongly” hit by the global
financial crisis and the euro member’s banks must clean up their
balance sheets, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  “Even though the Slovenian authorities have maintained the
stability of the system, the business of their commercial banks
has worsened, affected mostly by their exposure to the
 construction industry , resulting in losses in the last two
years,” the IMF said in a statement today after it completed
its visit to Slovenia.  The short-term priority of the country’s authorities
“should be to re-capitalize its banks and clean their balance
sheets,” said the IMF, whose mission led by Vassili Prokopenko
studied Slovenia’s financial sector, vulnerability to systemic
risk and regulatory framework.  Slovenian banks, including the two largest Nova Ljubljanska
Banka d.d. and  Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor (KBMR)  d.d., are still
reeling from the 2009 recession which forced them to post record
losses as they put aside reserves to cover bad loans. NLB posted
its third consecutive loss for last year amounting to 239
million euros ($314 million) while Nova Kreditna reported its
first loss of 53.6 million euros since the share sale in 2007.  Banks will probably report further losses this year as the
economy slides into recession, the central bank said last month.
The export-driven economy, which contracted an annual 0.2
percent last year, may shrink 1.2 percent this year, according
to the central bank’s estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
