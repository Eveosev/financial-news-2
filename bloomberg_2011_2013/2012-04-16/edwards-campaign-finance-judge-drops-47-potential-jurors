The federal judge presiding over
 John Edwards ’s trial on campaign finance violations dismissed 47
potential jurors for cause.  The majority of those excused indicated on an initial
questionnaire that they had already made up their minds about
the former Democratic presidential candidate’s guilt or
innocence, U.S. District Judge Catherine Eagles said during a
hearing today in Greensboro, North Carolina. Jurors were also
dismissed based on conflicts of interest and hardship.  Edwards, 58, a former North Carolina senator, is scheduled
to go on trial next week on charges he violated campaign finance
rules and used more than $925,000 in contributions to hide an
affair. He has denied the charges. Each of the six counts he
faces carries a maximum five-year prison term and $250,000 fine.  The remaining 138 jurors will appear starting tomorrow for
interviews in groups of 12, Eagles said. The process of choosing
a 12-member jury and four alternates is scheduled to be
completed April 23, followed by opening arguments in the case.  The jury pool was pulled from  North Carolina ’s federal
middle district, an area that includes 24 counties in the
central part of the state.  The case is U.S. v. Edwards, 11-00161, U.S. District Court,
Middle District of North Carolina (Greensboro)  To contact the reporters on this story:
