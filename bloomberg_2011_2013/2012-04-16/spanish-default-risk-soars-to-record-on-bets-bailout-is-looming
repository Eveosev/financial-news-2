Spanish debt risk climbed to a
record for a second day and signalled a 37 percent chance the
nation will default as its borrowing costs surged to levels that
prompted its neighbors to seek bailouts.  Credit-default swaps tied to  Spain ’s bonds jumped 19 basis
points to 521, according to CMA prices at 11 a.m. in London. The
Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of contracts on 15
governments rose three basis points to 283, while swaps on  Italy 
climbed eight basis points to a three-month high of 443.  Spain is due to sell new debt tomorrow before European
officials travel to  Washington  later this week to seek a bigger
war chest to battle the financial crisis. The nation’s 10-year
 bond yield  soared to 6.15 percent, the highest since Dec. 1 and
approaching the 7 percent level that foresaw the international
rescues of  Greece , Ireland and Portugal.  “The focus is on Spain and contagion,” said  Elisabeth Afseth , an analyst at Investec Bank Plc in London. “There isn’t
a rescue fund in place sufficient to deal with both Spain and
Italy.”  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 European companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings
rose 2.5 basis points to 682.5, according to BNP Paribas SA.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers increased 4.25 basis points to 251.25,
the highest in almost a week. Swaps on Banco Santander SA,
Spain’s biggest lender, rose 12 basis points to 433.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13 million) of debt for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
