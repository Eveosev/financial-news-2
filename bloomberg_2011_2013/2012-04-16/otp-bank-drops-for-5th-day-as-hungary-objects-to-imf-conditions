OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, snapped four days of losses, lifting the country’s stock
index, as a report showed retail sales in the U.S. rose more
than forecast in March.  The shares gained 1.5 percent to 3,424 forint by the close
in Budapest. The benchmark BUX stock  index  added 0.2 percent and
Hungary’s currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 297.85 per euro.  OTP retreated as much as 2.4 percent earlier today as Prime
Minister Viktor Orban’s government objected to political
conditions for an International Monetary Fund credit line.  To contact the reporter on this story:
