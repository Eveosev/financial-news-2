Wesley Korir won the 116th  Boston
Marathon  with a late charge, while Sharon Cherop took the
women’s race in a final sprint for a Kenyan sweep under severe
heat that had officials urging runners to stay home.  Korir, 29, passed another Kenyan, Levy Matebo, around the
25-mile mark and won the 26.2-mile (42.2-kilometer) race from
Hopkinton,  Massachusetts , to Boston in 2 hours, 12 minutes, 40
seconds. Matebo held the lead alone from around the 21-mile mark
until Korir passed him, and finished second in the world’s
oldest continuous marathon at 2:13:06.  Jason Hartmann, from Boulder,  Colorado , was the top U.S.
finisher, in fourth at 2:14:31. Temperatures rose to 78 degrees
(25.6 Celsius) as the lead runners finished, according to
Weather.com, and a high in the upper 80s is forecast, more than
30 degrees above normal.  “I knew that I had to keep them in sight if I had an
opportunity,” Korir said in a televised interview. “When they
took off, I knew the heat was very hot, so I knew that if I
tried to take off at that speed, I’d top out. I said, ‘Let me
just go at a consistent pace and see if I can catch up with
them.’”  Cherop outkicked Jemima Jelagat Sumgong of Kenya in the
final mile of the women’s race to win her first  Boston  Marathon
by two seconds, at 2:31:50. That maintained the race’s recent
string of tightly contested women’s finishes, with the last five
years decided by a combined 10 seconds.  It was 73 degrees (22.8 Celsius) in Hopkinton at 10 a.m.
Boston for the start of the men’s race. Temperatures rose
steadily as the race moved East toward Boston, with the first
runners crossing the line with temperatures around 78 degrees.  Record High  The normal high temperature for today in the Boston area is
55 degrees (12.8 Celsius), according to the  National Weather
Service . The record for the day is 82 degrees, set in 1976.  About 4,290 of the race’s 26,716 entrants, or 16 percent,
didn’t participate in the race today, organizers announced on
their Twitter page. Entrants were given the option yesterday of
withdrawing from this year’s race in exchange for a guaranteed
spot in 2013, because of the heat.  Last year in cooler temperatures, Geoffrey Mutai of  Kenya 
won the men’s marathon in a course-record 2:03:02. Mutai’s time
was the fastest marathon ever run, but wasn’t a world record
because Boston isn’t a record-eligible course.  Mutai, 30, dropped from the lead pack today around the
half-way point and withdrew from the race 18 miles in due to
cramps. Caroline Kilel of Kenya, the defending woman’s champion,
was walking toward the end of the race and didn’t place in the
top 30.  ‘Serious Issue’  Two days before the race, the  Boston Athletic Association ,
the marathon’s organizer, issued a warm-weather advisory to all
runners. The memo warned inexperienced athletes to pull out of
the competition, and elite runners to run a slower pace and
“frequently take breaks by walking.”  “This will not be a day to run a personal best,” the
organizers said in the advisory. “Heat stroke is a serious
issue and is related to intensity of running as well as the heat
and humidity.”  Organizers also sent an e-mail to every runner with video
instructions on administering hands-only CPR, which could aid a
fellow runner who goes into cardiac arrest.  The last on-course death of a Boston Marathon participant
occurred in 2002. In 2007, the Chicago Marathon suspended its
race after about 3 1/2 hours following the death of a runner as
temperatures climbed to 88 degrees (31.1 Celsius).  A Kenyan or Ethiopian has won 23 of the last 25 men’s
Boston Marathons and 14 of the last 16 women’s races.  Race Winnings  Korir and Cherop each won  $150,000 , $100,000 each less than
the top prizes at January’s Dubai Marathon, the world’s richest.
Korir, who graduated from the University of Louisville, said
that he would donate most of his winnings to a charity that
provides schooling for children in Kenya.  No American runner has won the Boston Marathon since Lisa
Larsen Weidenbach took the women’s race in 1985. The last U.S.
male to win the race was Greg Meyer in 1983.  Elite American runners, including Olympic silver medalist
Meb Keflezighi and  Ryan Hall , last year’s top U.S. finisher,
didn’t compete today. Qualifying for the U.S. Olympic team is
complete.  Joshua Cassidy of  Canada  won the men’s push-rim wheelchair
race in a course-record 1:18:25, while American Shirley Reilly
won the women’s wheelchair race in a final sprint at 1:37:36.
Cassidy raced alone for the second half of the race, out-pacing
defending-champion Masazumi Soejima of  Japan , who finished
fourth in 1:23:27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
