France’s sovereign  credit rating 
may not be subject to an imminent change, Moody’s Investors
Service said.  Moody’s placed France on “negative outlook” on Feb. 13,
adding that it retains its Aaa credit rating. Socialist
presidential candidate Francois Hollande said yesterday that he
expects Moody’s to act on that outlook on May 12, six days after
the final round of this year’s presidential election.  “The negative outlook on this rating doesn’t signal any
imminent change but constitutes an indication of the probable
evolution in the next 12 to 18 months,” Moody’s said today in
an e-mailed statement in response to Hollande.  Standard & Poor’s  stripped France of its AAA credit rating
on Jan. 13.  “Hollande wants to win votes, but there are things too
serious to talk about like that,” President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
said in an electoral rally in south-west France today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
