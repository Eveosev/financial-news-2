The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars dropped against their U.S. counterpart and the yen as
Spanish bond yields rose, spurring concern Europe’s sovereign-
debt crisis will spread.  The two South Pacific currencies weakened against most
major peers as raw-materials prices fell for a second day. Spain
is scheduled to sell debt today as the nation’s borrowing costs
jumped to the highest this year. Italian government-debt yields
were at almost a two-month high.  “Risk assets are going to sell off pretty hard this week,
because there are a lot of negatives out there,” said  Richard Franulovich , a senior currency strategist at  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  in New York. “You could get a little bit of a blood bath
around the Spanish auction. Pressure on  Spain  and Italy will
intensify”  The Australian dollar depreciated 0.1 percent to $1.0356 in
New York yesterday, falling for a second consecutive day. It was
0.8 percent weaker versus the yen at 83.27.  New Zealand’s dollar declined 0.3 percent to 82.04 U.S.
cents and dropped 0.9 percent to 65.96 yen.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  Index (SPGSCITR)  of 24 raw materials sank 1
percent.  Spanish 10-year  bond yields  jumped as much as 18 basis
points, or 0.18 percentage point, to 6.16 percent yesterday, the
highest level since Dec. 1, before trading at 6.07 percent.
Five-year credit-default swaps linked to Spanish bonds reached
an all-time high of 521, CMA data show.  Italian bond yields climbed as much as 15 basis points to
5.67 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
