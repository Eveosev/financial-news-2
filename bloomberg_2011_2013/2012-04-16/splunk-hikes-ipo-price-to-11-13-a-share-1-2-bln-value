Splunk Inc. (SPLK) , a maker of software
that helps companies analyze data, increased the  price range  for
its planned initial public offering to $11 to $13 apiece.  At the top of the range, the share sale would value the San
Francisco-based company at $1.23 billion, if underwriters
exercise an overallotment option, according to a  filing  today
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Splunk, which
will trade under the symbol SPLK on the Nasdaq Stock Market,
previously set a price range $8 to $10 a share.  Splunk delivers software through the Internet that helps
companies monitor and analyze data to improve  service , cut
operations costs and reduce security risks. The company said it
had more than 3,700 customers as of Jan. 31, including Bank of
America Corp., Zynga Inc. and  Harvard University .  Revenue in the fiscal year that ended Jan. 31 rose 83
percent to $121 million. Splunkâ€™s net loss widened to $11
million from $3.8 million a year earlier, according to the
filing.  Chief Executive Officer Godfrey Sullivan has run Splunk
since 2008. He previously led Hyperion Solutions Corp. and
helped sell that company for $3.3 billion to Oracle Corp. in
2007. In July, the company named David Conte as chief financial
officer, gaining an executive with experience at a public
company.  Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse Group AG, JPMorgan Chase &
Co. and Bank of America are leading the IPO. Pacific Crest
Securities, UBS AG and Cowen and Co. are also working on it.  Paul Wilke, a Splunk spokesman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
