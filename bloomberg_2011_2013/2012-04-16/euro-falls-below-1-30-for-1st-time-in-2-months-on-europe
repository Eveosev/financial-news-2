The euro touched the lowest level
against the yen since February as Spanish bond yields touched a
2012 high after a minister called on the  European Central Bank 
to do more to stem debt-market turmoil.  The 17-nation currency reached below $1.30 for the first
time in two months before rising against most major peers as
risk appetite improved and stocks erased losses. Norway’s krone
and the South African rand strengthened as U.S. retail sales
rose more than forecast, boosting confidence in the recovery of
the world’s biggest economy.  “The market is growing increasingly nervous about Spain
and  Italy  in particular,” said  Omer Esiner , chief market
analyst in  Washington  at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc., a
currency brokerage. “We’ve seen some of the risk-off sentiment
dissipate a little bit. The dollar, which had been up overnight,
is now under pressure against the euro and some of the commodity
currencies.”  The euro fell 0.1 percent to 105.71 yen at 2:10 p.m. in  New
York  after dropping earlier to 104.63, the weakest since Feb.
20. The shared currency rose 0.5 percent to $1.3138 after
falling to as low as $1.2995. The euro was little changed at
82.59 U.K. pence after reaching 82.10 pence earlier, the lowest
since September 2010. The yen appreciated 0.6 percent to 80.46
per dollar and touched 80.30, the strongest level since Feb. 29.  Norway’s krone gained 0.7 percent to 5.7490 per dollar, and
the South African rand added as much as 0.4 percent to 7.9139
before trading at 7.9426, up 0.1 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent after
falling as much as 0.4 percent.  Spanish Debt  The euro slid against the yen after the cost of insuring
 Spain ’s debt reached a record and Jaime Garcia-Legaz, the
nation’s deputy economy minister, said in an interview on April
13 that the ECB should “step up purchases of bonds.”  Spanish 10-year  bond yields  jumped as much as 18 basis
points, or 0.18 percentage point, to 6.16 percent, the highest
level since Dec. 1, before trading at 6.06 percent. Five-year
credit-default swaps linked to Spanish bonds jumped to an all-
time high, CMA data show. Spain will sell 12- and 18-month bills
tomorrow, followed by auctions of debt due in October 2014 and
January 2022 on April 19.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is struggling to convince
investors he can get Spain’s finances under control after last
month refusing to meet deficit targets set by the European
Commission and the previous government.  Italian 10-year bond yields reached 5.67 percent,
approaching a two-month high.  The euro lost 5.7 percent over the past year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes, the worst performer
among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by the gauges.
The yen gained 6.4 percent, and the dollar rose 4.2 percent.  ‘Still Lower’  “The euro is under a bit of pressure with the periphery in
focus, particularly as we have some Spanish issuance this
week,” said  Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in London. “The path of
least resistance is still lower, and we’re probably looking for
euro-yen to lead the way.”  The dollar rose earlier versus most major counterparts as
data showed U.S. consumer purchases rose last month, damping
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will add to monetary easing.  Retail sales  increased 0.8 percent, following a revised 1
percent advance in February, Commerce Department figures showed
today in Washington. The median forecast of 81 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a rise of 0.3 percent.
Eleven of 13 categories showed gains.  Fed Views  Four members of the  Federal Open Market Committee  judged
that monetary policy should be tightened from 2015, while two
preferred 2016, according to a Jan. 25 statement from the Fed.
The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of bonds from 2008 to 2011
in two rounds of quantitative easing.  The euro may fall to as low as $1.2805 after breaking below
a key level of support today, according to Credit Suisse AG.  The currency is poised to weaken to the 78.6 percent
Fibonacci retracement of its rally in the first quarter after
declining through the so-called head-and-shoulders neckline at
$1.3030, Steve Miley, director of technical analysis in  London ,
said in a telephone interview.  Support refers to an area where buy orders may be
clustered. A head and shoulders is formed when a currency makes
three consecutive peaks, with the middle being the highest. A
neckline is drawn across the base of the three peaks. Fibonacci
analysis is based on the theory that prices rise or fall by
certain percentages after reaching a high or low.  China’s Yuan  China’s yuan tumbled against the dollar as the central bank
doubled the daily trading band, reflecting declines in emerging-
market currencies.  Effective today the People’s Bank of China is allowing 1
percent moves from its daily fixing, after keeping the limit at
0.5 percent since May 2007.  “The yuan is weaker as investors are again worried about
 Europe  and a bit on  China ’s growth,” said Tommy Ong, Hong Kong-
based senior vice president of treasury and markets at DBS Bank
( Hong Kong ). “It’s an opportune time for China to widen the
band when appreciation expectations aren’t so strong.”  China’s currency weakened 0.2 percent to 6.315 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
