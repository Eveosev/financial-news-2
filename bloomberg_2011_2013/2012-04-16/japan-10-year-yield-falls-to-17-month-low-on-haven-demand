Japan ’s  bonds  rose, sending the
benchmark 10-year yield to a 17-month low as Asian stocks fell
amid concern the European debt crisis is spreading, boosting
demand for the relative safety of government debt.  Bonds also advanced as  Bank of Japan (8301)  Masaaki Shirakawa said
today the central bank is doing its best to overcome deflation,
spurring speculation that the BOJ will ease policy further at a
meeting later this month. The Ministry of Finance is set to
auction 2.5 trillion yen ($31 billion) of five-year notes
tomorrow.  “There is a flight-to-quality bid in JGBs as we’re seeing
a decline in stocks,” said Hidenori Suezawa, Tokyo-based chief
strategist at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc, one of the 25
primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt sales.  The  yield  on the 10-year notes fell one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 0.93 percent as of 4:12 p.m. in Tokyo
at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt
broker. The 1 percent security due March 2022 rose 0.09 yen to
100.64 yen. The yield was the lowest since Nov. 5, 2010.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery gained 0.10 to
142.69 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares lost 0.9 percent
today before  Spain  sells 12-month and 18-month bills tomorrow,
followed by auctions of debt due in 2014 and 2022 on April 19.
 Yields (GSPG10YR)  on the nation’s 10-year notes soared as much as 18 basis
points to 6 percent on April 13, edging toward the 7 percent
level that pushed  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  into rescues.  The BOJ set an inflation goal of 1 percent in February,
when it also boosted planned bond purchases by 10 trillion yen.
At their next meeting on April 27, BOJ board members will review
their current price outlook of 0.5 percent inflation for the
fiscal year starting in April 2013.  “I don’t see any problem at tomorrow’s five-year auction
because there are expectations for further easing by the BOJ,”
said Tadashi Matsukawa, who oversees the equivalent of $1.7
billion as head of fixed-income securities at Tokyo-based
PineBridge Investments Japan Co. “That will add to demand from
cash-rich banks.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
