spokesman  Rob Davies . At JPMorgan, Owens was responsible for
commodity and foreign exchange-linked structured products
globally, Davies said.  Owens is based in London and reports to Giancarlo Saronne,
Nomuraâ€™s global head of structuring. He replaced Mark Stafford
who left the bank last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
