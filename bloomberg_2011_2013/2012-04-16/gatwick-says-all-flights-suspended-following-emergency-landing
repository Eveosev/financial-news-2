Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd.
passengers used evacuation chutes to escape their plane after
the jetliner made an emergency landing today at  London ’s  Gatwick 
airport because of a technical problem.  The twin-engine  Airbus (EAD)  SAS A330-300 aircraft took off for
Orlando,  Florida , on flight VS27 before turning back to the
U.K., Virgin Atlantic said. The escape chutes were deployed when
the jet came to a rest on the runway.  “The captain decided as a precautionary measure to
immediately evacuate the aircraft,” the U.K. airline said in a
statement. Fifteen people were hospitalized after the landing,
including 14 sent to major trauma centers suffering from
suspected fractures, South East Coast Ambulance Service said in
an e-mailed statement.  Departures from Gatwick, the world’s busiest single-runway
airport, were suspended before resuming from a standby strip
parallel to the main one, which reopened after about three
hours. Gatwick, 25 miles south of London, is a base for carriers
including  EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  and British Airways. Traffic through the
airport rose 6.9 percent to 33.8 million passengers in the year
to March 31.  Gatwick briefly suspended services April 13 after a hot air
balloon strayed into its airspace.  Virgin Atlantic is working closely with the authorities to
establish the cause of today’s incident, the airline said.
Toulouse, France-based Airbus is aware of the incident and
“ready to offer support,” spokesman  Justin Dubon  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
