(Corrects second paragraph after company says it misstated
Chocano’s responsibilities.)  StormHarbour Securities LP, the
brokerage founded by ex- Citigroup Inc. (C)  traders, hired former
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  executive Gonzalo Chocano to advise
Spanish clients amid concern the country may need a bailout.  Chocano, 42, who joined today, will “drive StormHarbour’s
client relationships and coverage in Spain and continental
Europe,” according to an e-mailed statement from the firm.
He’ll be based in London and his duties will include fixed-
income sales and trading, structuring, advisory and
underwriting.  The cost of insuring  Spain’s debt  against default advanced
to a record today amid speculation the country may struggle to
avoid an international rescue. Spanish lenders’ borrowings from
the  European Central Bank  surged almost 50 percent last month,
showing more dependence on government funding as the firms set
aside more reserves to cover losses on real-estate loans.  Chocano, who started his securities-industry career at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in 1994, joined Merrill Lynch & Co. in
2000, according to the statement. In 2010, the year after Bank
of America bought Merrill Lynch, he was named co-head of a new
futures and derivatives clearing group. He left in 2011.  StormHarbour, with headquarters in  London  and New York, was
started in 2009 by former Citigroup fixed-income executives
Antonio Cacorino and Fredrick Chapey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
