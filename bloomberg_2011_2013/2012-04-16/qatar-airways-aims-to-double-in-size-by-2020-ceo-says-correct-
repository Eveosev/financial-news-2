(Corrects date in first paragraph.)  Qatar Airways Ltd., the second-
biggest Middle Eastern Airline, will more than double in size by
2020, carrying 2 1/2 times more passengers than it does today,
Chief Executive Officer Akbar  Al Baker  said.  Still, growth at the Gulf carrier could be held back by
aircraft delivery delays, something that could prompt it to
order Asian-built jets should they be demonstrably safe and
efficient, Al Baker said in a panel discussion in Abu Dhabi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
