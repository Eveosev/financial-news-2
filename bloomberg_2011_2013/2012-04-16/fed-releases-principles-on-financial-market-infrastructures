U.S. regulators published a final
report on principles for financial market infrastructures aimed
at strengthening risk management for payments systems and
central counterparties.  The principles, released today by the  Federal Reserve ,
Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Securities and Exchange
Commission, also set standards for central securities
depositories, securities settlement systems, and trade
repositories, according to a joint statement by the regulators.  The standards are designed to make the financial systems
“more resilient to financial crises and, in particular, to
participant defaults,” according to a statement by William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
