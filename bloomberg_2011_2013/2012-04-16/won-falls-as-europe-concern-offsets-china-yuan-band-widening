South  Korea ’s won fell for the
first time in three days as concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will
worsen sapped demand for riskier assets and the central bank cut
its 2012 economic growth forecast.  Government bonds  rose.  The  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index of shares dropped 0.8 percent, following a
decline in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as the cost of
insuring Spain’s bonds against default surged to a record last
week. The  Bank of Korea  lowered its growth forecast today to 3.5
percent, from a December estimate of 3.7 percent. China, the
biggest buyer of Korean exports, widened the yuan’s trading band
in a step toward making its currency fully convertible.  “With  Spain ’s debt issue brought up again and Korea’s
growth forecast lowered, there was increased dollar demand,
especially among offshore investors,” said Kim Do Hee, a Seoul-
based currency trader at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group.  The won fell 0.3 percent to close at 1,138.63 per dollar in
 Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
1,131.25 on April 13, a one-week high. One-month implied
volatility for the won, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, rose eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage
point, to 8.65 percent.  The central bank lowered its 2012 inflation forecast to 3.2
percent from 3.3 percent. Next year, economic growth will likely
accelerate to 4.2 percent while inflation will moderate to 3.1
percent, according to today’s statement. The current-account
surplus is expected to narrow to $12.5 billion from $14.5
billion this year.  More Flexible Yuan  The People’s Bank of  China  now allows 1 percent moves from
a daily fixing, after keeping the limit at 0.5 percent since May
2007. A more flexible yuan may help Governor Zhou Xiaochuan
control inflation and support an economy that expanded in the
first quarter at the slowest pace since mid-2009. The yuan has
weakened 0.4 percent so far this year after strengthening 4.7
percent in 2011.  “We should consider possibilities for yuan weakening, not
only strengthening, after the trading band expansion,” said
Jung Kyung Parl, head of market analysis team at KEB Futures Co.
in Seoul. “The decline in China’s reserves and yuan
appreciation last year boosts the case for China to weaken the
currency to support exports, which will limit won gains.”  The yield on  South Korea ’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 dropped four basis points to 3.46 percent in Seoul, Korea
Exchange Inc. prices show. That’s the lowest rate since
February. Three-year debt futures rose 0.06 to 104.11 and the
one-year interest-rate swap slid two basis points to 3.50
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
