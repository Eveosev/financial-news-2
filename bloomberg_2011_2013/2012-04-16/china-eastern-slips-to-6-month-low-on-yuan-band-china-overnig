China Eastern Airlines Corp. (CEA) 
tumbled to the lowest level in six months in U.S. trading on
concern a more flexible yuan will erode foreign-exchange gains.  China Eastern, the nation’s second-largest carrier by
passengers, and  China Southern Airlines Co. (ZNH) , the biggest,
dropped after policy makers announced that they were widening
the band the yuan is allowed to trade within for the first time
since 2007. E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. slid after its chief
financial officer resigned, leading declines in the  Bloomberg
China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese shares in the
U.S., which lost 1.5 percent to 101.62 yesterday in  New York .  The yuan had its largest drop in more than a week versus
the dollar yesterday, after the People’s Bank of China said on
April 14 it was doubling the currency’s trading band to 1
percent from a so-called daily fixing rate. Fluctuations in the
yuan, which weakened 0.1 percent last quarter, meant currency
earnings for  China Eastern  were “significantly lower” than for
the first three months of 2011, the company said April 13.  “Chinese airlines, which previously reported foreign-
exchange gains as a benefit from yuan gains, may be impacted by
the currency policy change should the yuan react with a
depreciation,” said Alex Ashby, a New York-based research
analyst at Global X Funds, an exchange-traded fund company which
manages $1.3 billion including Chinese equities. “It is not
very clear yet how the yuan rate will move after the band
widening.”  New Limit  The  IShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., declined for a second day,
dropping 0.9 percent to $37.08. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
fell 0.1 percent to 1,369.57 with 278 stocks on the gauge
advancing while 216 declined.  The yuan weakened 0.2 percent yesterday to 6.3150 per
dollar in  Shanghai , the biggest decline since April 5, according
to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. China’s central bank
set its  fixing rate  yesterday 0.13 percent lower at 6.2960 per
dollar. The yuan weakened as much as 0.5 percent from that rate,
failing to test the new limit.  American depositary receipts of Shanghai-based China
Eastern fell 3.6 percent to $15 in the U.S. yesterday, the
lowest close since Oct. 7. The ADRs, each representing 50 common
shares in the company, traded 0.3 percent above the carrier’s
 Hong Kong  stock, which tumbled 4.9 percent to HK$2.32, the
equivalent of 30 U.S. cents. The premium reversed a 1 percent
discount on April 13.  China  Eastern and its larger competitor China Southern
expect net income to decrease more than 50 percent in the first
quarter because of smaller foreign-exchange gains, higher jet
fuel prices and slower economic growth, both carriers said April
13 in statements to the Hong Kong stock exchange.  Currency Gains  China Eastern  reported  1.87 billion yuan ($300 million) in
net foreign-exchange gains in 2011, compared with 1.07 billion
yuan of increases in 2010, according to its March 25 statement
to the Hong Kong exchange.  The yuan appreciated 4.7 percent versus the dollar in 2011
and gained 3.6 percent in 2010. The currency’s strength against
the greenback last year was the main driver behind China
Eastern’s 2.02 billion yuan of finance income, the company said
in its March 25 filing.  ADRs of Guangzhou-based China Southern slid 2 percent to
$22.07 yesterday, the weakest level in four trading sessions.
The ADRs’  discount  to the company’s Hong Kong stock narrowed to
1.6 percent, from 2.3 percent on April 13.  Yuan Depreciation  Yingying Hou and Paul Dewberry, analysts at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch, said they are assuming the yuan will depreciate
0.5 percent this year. The analysts remain positive on China
Southern’s stock because a lack of foreign-exchange gains
“looks reflected in its valuation,” they wrote in a research
note yesterday.  China Southern’s Hong Kong stock  trade for  7.63 times
estimated earnings over the next 12 months, after the multiple
reached a five-month high of 7.85 on April 13, data compiled by
Bloomberg showed. That compares with 5.44 times for China
Eastern.  Shirley Lam, an analyst at Nomura International Hong Kong
Ltd. reiterated her buy ratings on both carriers yesterday. She
maintained a 12-price month price target of HK$5.90 for China
Southern’s Hong Kong stock and HK$4.36 for China Eastern.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slipped 0.1 percent to
2,357.03 yesterday, trimming its gains this year to 7.2 percent.
The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies
traded in Hong Kong dropped 0.8 percent to 10,844.74, snapping a
two-day advance.  ‘More Volatility’  The widening of the yuan’s trading band “has no immediate
impact on the market, while down the road, it will introduce
more volatility in Chinese stocks,” said Bart Turtelboom, the
London-based co-head of  emerging markets  at GLG Partners, which
oversees about $26 billion, said by phone yesterday. “Chinese
stocks will rise further from here as the economic slowdown is
near the bottom and we’ve seen signs of recovery.”  Beijing-based E-Commerce, known as  Dangdang (DANG) , tumbled 15
percent to $8.63 in New York, the biggest one-day drop since
June 2011. The company said in a statement yesterday that Chief
Financial Officer Conor Chia-huang Yang had resigned.  Yang will stay with Dangdang, China’s biggest Internet
bookseller, for a period as long as three months as the company
searches for a replacement, according to the statement. Dangdang
spokeswoman Maria Xin could not be immediately reached for
comment outside of Chinese business hours.  Spreadtrum Communications Inc. (SPRD) , a Shanghai-based mobile-
phone chip designer, plunged 12 percent to $14.93, the biggest
daily slide since Feb. 29.  Price Target Cut  Analysts led by Bill Lu at Morgan Stanley downgraded the
company yesterday to equal-weight from overweight, meaning they
expect the stock to be in line with the total return of the
relevant country MSCI index over the next 12 to 18 months. They
cut the price target for its stock to $18.31 from $26.50.  “The company’s products are not quite ready for prime time
and we don’t see them being ready for another one to two
quarters,” the analysts wrote in a research note yesterday. “A
faster ramp of the China smartphone market could lead to a
short-term hiccup as 2G slows and smartphone products are not
quite ready to take over.”  This “temporary” issue could get resolved by the second
half this year, the analysts wrote.  Spreadtrum has lost 28 percent this year after rising 14
percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
