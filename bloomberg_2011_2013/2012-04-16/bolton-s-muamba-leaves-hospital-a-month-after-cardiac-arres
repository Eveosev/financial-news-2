Bolton Wanderers soccer player
Fabrice Muamba was discharged from the hospital today, a month
after his heart stopped for more than an hour during an F.A. Cup
quarterfinal.  Muamba thanked staff members who had treated him at London
Chest Hospital and said he will “forever be in their debt,”
according to a statement on Bolton’s website. A photograph on
the website showed Muamba, dressed in a gray tracksuit and white
sneakers, grinning and shaking hands with two doctors.  “I also wish to say thank you to all the many well-wishers
who have sent thousands of messages of support,” Muamba told
the website.  He said he looked forward to continuing his recovery and
spending “precious time” with his family.  Muamba, a 24-year-old midfielder, has been in the hospital
since collapsing on the field during the televised quarterfinal
at Tottenham on March 17. He is in his fourth season with
Bolton.  Piermario Morosini, a 25-year-old midfielder on loan at the
Italian soccer club Livorno from Udinese, died on April 14 after
suffering a cardiac arrest during a match against Pescara.  The Italian soccer federation suspended all the weekend’s
remaining matches because of his death.  To contact the reporter on this story:
