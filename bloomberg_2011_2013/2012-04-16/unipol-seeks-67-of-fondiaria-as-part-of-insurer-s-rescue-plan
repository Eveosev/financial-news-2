Unipol Gruppo Finanziario SpA (UNI)  would
hold about 67 percent of insurer  Fondiaria-SAI SpA (FSA)  after a
planned merger is completed, valuing the biggest investor in
 Italy ’s second-largest insurer at a 33 percent discount.  Unipol said it values shares of  Premafin Finanziaria SpA (PF) ,
Fondiaria’s controlling shareholder, at as much as 19.5 euro
cents ($0.26) a share, according to a stock-exchange statement.
That’s 33 percent lower than Premafin’s last trading price
before its suspension today. Unipol’s proposed terms of the
merger would allow it to hold 66.7 percent of the new entity.  “In the best case for Unipol, and worse case for
Fondiaria-SAI and Milano minorities, Unipol will hold 66 percent
of the new company,” Atanasio Pantarrotas, an analyst at Credit
Agricole Cheuvreux said in a note April 13.  Unipol agreed in January to buy new shares in Premafin as
part of a plan to rescue unprofitable Fondiaria. The purchase
will allow Premafin to participate in the 1.1 billion-euro stock
sale announced by Fondiaria on Jan. 30. After the capital
increase, Unipol’s insurance unit, Premafin, Fondiaria and its
unit  Milano Assicurazioni SpA (MI)  will merge to challenge Italy’s
biggest insurer,  Assicurazioni Generali SpA. (G)   Board Meeting  Premafin’s board is meeting today to review Unipol’s
evaluation. If directors approve the plan, both Fondiaria and
Milano’s boards will discuss it later today.  Fondiaria, which gets most of its revenue from property and
casualty businesses, is suffering from rising claims and tougher
competition at home. The insurer posted a  net loss  of 852.7
million euros last year, after it wrote down the value of non-
strategic assets and real estate by 657 million euros.  Unipol, based in Bologna, forecast the newly merged entity
will have more than 300 million euros of additional revenue and
cost savings by 2015. It targets net income of 970 million euros
in 2015, and a combined ratio, or claims and expenses as a
percentage of premiums, of 93 percent at the end of 2015,
indicating profitable underwriting, the company said March 15.  Shares of Unipol, Fondiaria, Premafin and Milano
Assicurazioni were suspended at 4:42 p.m today pending news.
Unipol fell 5.2 percent to 19.85 euros in Milan before being
suspended. Fondiaria dropped 5.9 percent to 82.8 cents and
Premafin rose 0.4 percent to 29.22 cents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
