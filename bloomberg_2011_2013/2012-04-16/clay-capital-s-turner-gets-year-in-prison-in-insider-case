James F. Turner II, chief
investment officer of the hedge fund Clay Capital Management
LLC, was sentenced to one year in prison for  insider trading 
that prosecutors said made more than $2.5 million.  Turner, 45, was sentenced today in federal court in Newark,
New Jersey, where he admitted Dec. 19 that he illegally traded
in shares of  Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) ,  Moldflow Corp (MFLO) . and  Salesforce.com
Inc. (CRM) , U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in a statement. U.S.
District Judge Dennis Cavanaugh also imposed a $25,000 fine.  Clay Capital ran the Clay Fund from 2007 to 2010, the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission said in a parallel civil
suit. Turner admitted he got tips from Scott Vollmar, his
brother-in-law and a director of business development at
Autodesk, and from Scott Robarge, a college friend and manager
at Salesforce.com.  Turner, of Traverse City,  Michigan , pleaded guilty to one
count of securities fraud. He faced as many as 20 years in
prison. Joseph Bush, his attorney, didn’t immediately return a
call seeking comment.  Vollmar, of Florence,  Oregon , and Robarge, of Louisville,
Colorado, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities
fraud. They are to be sentenced May 14. Turner, Vollmar and
Robarge were sued Aug. 31 by the SEC over the scheme.  Turner and three partners founded Clay Capital as a hedge
fund in June 2006 to use the “investment prowess” of Turner,
according to the SEC. He had worked as a securities analyst and
portfolio manager for two financial services companies and a
hedge fund, the agency said.  Assets Liquidated  While the investments of Turner and his partners remain in
the Clay Fund, its other assets were liquidated and distributed
in December 2010, the SEC said.  Turner admitted that from January 2008 to May 2008, Vollmar
gave him confidential information about Autodesk’s interest in
acquiring Moldflow. Turner bought $2.3 million in shares of
Moldflow for Clay Capital and $3.5 million for himself and
family members, he admitted.  After Autodesk, a  software company  in San Rafael,
 California , announced on May 1, 2008, that it was buying
Moldflow, Turner sold all of the shares. He made $650,000 in
illegal profits for Clay Capital and $1.1 million for his
family, the government said.  Turner separately generated $590,000 in illicit profits by
betting that Autodesk shares would fall after its earnings
announcement and lowered its earnings forecast on Feb. 26, 2008,
he admitted. Vollmar previously tipped him that the company
would have trouble meeting its earnings targets.  Turner also reaped $224,000 in illicit profits after
Robarge tipped him that Salesforce.com, a software company in
 San Francisco , would exceed the earnings estimates of analysts
for the quarter ended Jan. 31, 2008, according to court
documents.  The case is U.S. v. Turner, 2:11-cr-00868, U.S. District
Court, District of  New Jersey  (Newark).  To contact the reporter on this story:
