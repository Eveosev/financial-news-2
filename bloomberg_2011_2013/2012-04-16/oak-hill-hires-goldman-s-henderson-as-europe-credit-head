Oak Hill  Advisors LP, a U.S. asset
manager focused on high-yield bonds and distressed debt, hired
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s Doug Henderson to lead its performing
credit business in Europe.  Henderson worked for Goldman Sachs in London, where he
served as chairman of the bank’s European Credit Finance Group,
New York-based Oak Hill said in a statement today. He became a
partner at Goldman Sachs in 2004 and oversaw its restructuring,
high-yield debt, structured finance and real-estate finance
businesses in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, Oak Hill said.  About 50 partners departed New York-based Goldman Sachs
between January 2011 and January 2012. The executives left amid
declining earnings and increased regulation of U.S. banks.  Henderson succeeds Richard Munn, who will step down as a
full-time Oak Hill employee at the end of 2012, the company said
in the statement. Munn will become a senior adviser starting in
2013, assisting Oak Hill on its European investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
