Anglican leaders are to replace
Christchurch’s iconic cathedral with a cardboard structure after
the building was last year destroyed in  New Zealand ’s deadliest
earthquake in eight decades.  The temporary 700-seat cathedral will serve as a place for
worship and gathering until a new church is built, according to
a statement on the Christchurch  Cathedral  website. The
structure, which uses cardboard tubes as well as timber, steel
and concrete, is intended to last for more than 20 years.  The cathedral “is a symbol of hope for the future of this
city,” Richard Gray from the Transitional Cathedral Group said
in the statement. “It will attract interest nationally and
internationally drawing additional visitors to the city.”  The building was designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban
and will probably be completed by December, according to the
statement. It will comprise an A-frame structure based on a
concrete foundation, stabilized with shipping containers.  Christchurch Cathedral was marked for demolition in March
after officials concluded that the 130-year-old building was
damaged beyond repair. The new structure will be built on the
site of the destroyed St. John’s church at Latimer Square, on
the edge of the cordoned-off “red zone” and two blocks to the
east from Cathedral Square where the original cathedral is being
taken apart.  Christchurch has been struck by a series of devastating
earthquakes since September 2010, the worst killing 185 people
in February last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
