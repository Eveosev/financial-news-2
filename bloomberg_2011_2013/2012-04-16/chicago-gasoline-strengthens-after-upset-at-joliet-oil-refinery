Chicago  gasoline strengthened after
Exxon Mobil Corp. reported an operational upset at the Joliet
refinery in Illinois.  The plant flared gases as a result of the upset yesterday,
according to a filing with the Illinois Emergency Management
Agency. Tricia Simpson, an Exxon spokeswoman, said the filing
was accurate and declined to comment on details.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Chicago (CHCG87PC)  strengthened 18 cents to 6 cents a gallon versus futures
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:37 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
10.28 cents to $3.2089 a gallon.  The same fuel in the  Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)  held at a discount of 14.5
cents versus futures as refineries experienced weather-related
issues.  “Some electricity customers in the  Corpus Christi  area
have experienced voltage dips and lightning strikes as a storm
front comes through,” said Andy Heines, a spokesman for
 American Electric Power Co. Inc. (AEP) , which distributes electricity
in Corpus Christi.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  said a temporary power failure at its
Corpus Christi East refinery in Texas affected a compressor. The
115,000-barrel-a-day plant had a “weather-related power blip
affecting a compressor associated with the coker,” Bill Day, a
Valero spokesman based in San Antonio, said in an e-mail.  Flint Hills Resources LLC reported flaring at the West
plant in Corpus Christi, according to a notice from the Corpus
Christi local emergency planning committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
