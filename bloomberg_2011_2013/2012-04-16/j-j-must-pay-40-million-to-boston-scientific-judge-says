A Johnson & Johnson unit owes
 Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX)  more than $40 million in damages for
intentionally infringing a patent for coronary stents, a federal
judge ruled.  Boston Scientific won about $20 million from  Cordis Corp. (1320Q) 
in a May 2011 jury trial in Wilmington, Delaware. U.S. District
Judge Sue Robinson said in an opinion March 13 that Boston
Scientific deserved twice that much. Cordis filed an appeal of
the ruling April 10 with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit in  Washington , according to court records.  “Cordis was aware of and investigated” the patent,
Robinson wrote in her decision. “Doubling the jury’s award” is
“reasonable under the circumstances.”  Boston Scientific, based in Natick, Massachusetts, sued
Cordis in Minnesota in 2009. The case was transferred to
Delaware the following year.  Sandy Pound, a Cordis spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
return a message seeking comment on the ruling. Steven Campanini, a spokesman for Boston Scientific, said the company
couldn’t immediately comment.  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) , based in New Brunswick,  New Jersey , rose
58 cents to $64.12 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
at 1:50 p.m.  The case is Boston Scientific Corp. v. Cordis Corp.,
10CV315, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 5,922,021.  To contact the reporter on this story:
