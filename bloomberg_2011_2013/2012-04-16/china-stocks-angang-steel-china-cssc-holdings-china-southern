Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses as of the close.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, fell 2.14 points, or 0.1 percent, to
2,357.03. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  declined 0.3 percent to 2,574.04.  Angang Steel Co. (000898)  (000898 CH), the nation’s fifth-largest
steelmaker by market value, dropped 0.7 percent to 4.38 yuan.
Angang may have posted a loss of 1.89 billion yuan ($299.4
million) in the first quarter, compared with a profit of 71
million yuan the same period last year, it said in a statement
on April 13.  China CSSC Holdings Ltd. (600150)  (600150 CH), a unit of the
nation’s biggest shipbuilder, slid 3.8 percent to 32.71 yuan,
the biggest decline since March 28. First-quarter profit may
have fallen by about 65 percent from a year earlier, the company
said in a statement.  China Southern Airlines Co. (600029)  (600029 CH), Asia’s biggest air
carrier by passenger numbers, fell 1.7 percent to 4.63 yuan.
First-quarter profit probably dropped more than 50 percent from
a year ago, the company said in a statement on April 13. The
decline was caused by a “slowdown in the domestic economic
growth and the substantial increase of jet fuel prices,” it
said.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Chan Tien Hin  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
