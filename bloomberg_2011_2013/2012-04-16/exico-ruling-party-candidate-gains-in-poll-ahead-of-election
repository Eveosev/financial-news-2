Mexico ’s ruling party candidate
Josefina Vazquez Mota gained in the latest opinion poll before
July’s presidential election while remaining about 19 percentage
points behind the front-runner.  Vazquez Mota of the  National Action Party  had 22 percent
support, Grupo Economistas Asociados-ISA said yesterday in its
daily survey, compared with 18 percent backing in a poll by the
same company released April 11.  Support for Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the Party of the
Democratic Revolution candidate who narrowly lost to Felipe Calderon in the 2006 election, fell to 14 percent yesterday from
17 percent April 11. The poll’s margin of error is plus or minus
3 percentage points.  Enrique Pena Nieto of the  Institutional Revolutionary Party 
rose to 41 percent support from 39 percent April 11. GEA-ISA’s
poll surveyed 1,148 people in person from April 13 to April 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
