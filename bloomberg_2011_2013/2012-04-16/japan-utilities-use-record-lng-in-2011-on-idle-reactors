Japanese power providers said they
used record amounts of liquefied natural gas last year to
replace nuclear generation.  Japan ’s 10 regional power utilities burned 52.9 million
metric tons of LNG in the fiscal year ended in March, up 27
percent from the prior year, according to  data  today from the
Federation of Electric Power Companies.  The previous record for LNG consumption was 41.9 million
metric tons in the year ended in March 2008, Tetsu Oshikiri, a
federation spokesman, said at a press conference in Tokyo.  The utilities’ consumption of petroleum, which includes
crude and fuel oil, more than doubled to 23.3 million kiloliters,
according to the federation’s data. Petroleum consumption was
the highest in at least 10 years, said Oshikiri. Crude and fuel
oil consumption was 57.7 million kiloliters in the year ended in
March 1974, he said.  The average operating rate of nuclear plants in the latest
fiscal year was 24 percent, down from 67 percent a year earlier,
the federation said. The atomic utilization rate last year was
the lowest since Japan’s first reactor started in fiscal 1968.  Thermal-power generation rose 26 percent from a year
earlier, according to the federation. In the wake of radiation
leaks following last year’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi disaster, Japan
had one nuclear reactor, with a capacity of 912 megawatts, or
1.9 percent of the total, operating as of the end of March,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The following table shows Japanese utilities’ consumption
and purchases of  fuel oil , crude, LNG and coal in the fiscal
year that ended in March. Fuel oil and crude volumes are in
kiloliters, while those for LNG and coal are in tons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
