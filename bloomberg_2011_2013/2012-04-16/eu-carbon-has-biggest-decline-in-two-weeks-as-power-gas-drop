European Union carbon permits
dropped the most in almost two weeks before auctions this week
by  Austria ,  Germany  and the Netherlands and as power and
natural-gas contracts declined.  Carbon for delivery in December fell as much as 5.5 percent
to 6.85 euros ($8.91) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange, the biggest drop since April 4, and traded at 6.91
euros at 9:11 a.m. London time.  German power for next year decreased as much as 1.3 percent
to 51 euros a megawatt-hour, the lowest since Feb. 14, according
to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. Front-month U.K. gas
weakened 2 percent.  Carbon has jumped 15 percent after reaching a record-low
5.99 euros on April 4. The market is probably oversupplied by 10
percent in the five years through this year, including  United
Nations  offset credits, according to an estimate today by
Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  UN Certified Emission Reduction credits for December
dropped 5 percent to 3.84 euros a ton on ICE.  To contact the reporters on this story:
