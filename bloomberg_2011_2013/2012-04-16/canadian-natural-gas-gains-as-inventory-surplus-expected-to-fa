Canadian natural gas rose for the
first time in almost two weeks amid speculation of a lower-than-
normal gain in U.S. inventories that would shrink a surplus of
the fuel in storage.  Alberta  gas gained 2.7 percent. U.S. inventories rose 8
billion cubic feet in the week ended April 6 to 2.487 trillion,
or 59 percent above the five-year average for the week, the
 Energy Department (DOENUST5)  said. The surplus narrowed from 61 percent the
previous week, the biggest gap since April 2006.  “The storage surplus has probably peaked,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of research at IAF Advisors in Houston. “It
looks like from here it will probably decrease.”  Alberta gas for May delivery rose 4 cents to C$1.5075 a
gigajoule ($1.43 per million British thermal units) as of 2:50
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. It was
the first gain on NGX since April 3.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.
NGX gas is down 47 percent this year.  Natural gas for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 3.5 cents, or 1.8 percent, to settle at $2.016 per
million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago jumped
17.75 cents, or 9.5 percent, to $2.0517 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas rose 1.43 cents to $1.7507 per million Btu. At
Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, prices slipped 0.5 cent to $1.809.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16 billion cubic
feet, 776 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.11 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.13 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 1.09 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.56 billion cubic feet today, or 59 percent
of its capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.11
billion cubic feet at 1:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
