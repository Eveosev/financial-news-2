China  remained the  largest  foreign
U.S. creditor in February amid a rebound in the country’s
foreign-currency reserves as  Japan ’s purchases of Treasuries
picked up.  China’s holdings rose for a second straight month,
increasing by 1.1 percent to $1.18 trillion, U.S. Treasury
Department data released yesterday show. Those of Japan,
America’s second-largest lender, climbed 1.2 percent to $1.096
trillion after the Asian nation intervened in months prior to 
stem the yen’s appreciation. Net foreign purchases of 
Treasuries rose $41.2 billion, or 0.8 percent, to a record 
$5.1 trillion, the data show.  China’s currency reserves rose 3.9 percent in the first
three months of 2012 from the previous quarter, reversing the
first quarterly decline since 1998, according to the People’s
Bank of China.  “If their reserves continue to grow we should see a
channel into Treasuries,” said Shyam Rajan, an interest-rates
strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York, one of
the 21 primary dealers that trade with the  Federal Reserve .
“Foreign demand should continue to be strong, given the
indications we have had in the first quarter.”  China doubled the trading band of the yuan versus the
dollar on April 14, a move that  Stephen Roach , a professor at
 Yale University  and former non-executive chairman for Morgan
Stanley in  Asia , said signals official confidence in the
strength of the economy’s expansion.  China Holdings  The data showed China held $1.1662 trillion of Treasuries
in January, an increase from the $1.1595 trillion reported for
the period on March 15. The Treasury is now revising holdings
data on a monthly basis rather than annually based on the
nationality of the beneficial holder of the debt, while the
initial data will still count the location of the purchase.  China increased its holdings of longer-term notes and bonds
by $11.9 billion, or 1 percent, to $1.175 trillion. Its stake in
short-term bills rose by $800 million to $3.8 billion, Treasury
data show.  The rise in holdings comes after China reduced its position
in  U.S. government debt  in 2011 for the first time since the
Treasury started releasing the data in 2001, as yields fell to
record lows. The world’s second-largest economy held $1.15
trillion Treasuries as of Dec. 31, down from $1.16 trillion in
December 2010 and from a peak of $1.31 trillion in July 2011.  Japan Catches Up  Japan increased its holdings of U.S. government debt by 1.2
percent after adding 2.3 percent in January. The country in
in October and November stepped into markets to rein in the yen’s 
gains to support an export-led economic recovery from last year’s 
earthquake.  Government yen sales totaled 14.3 trillion yen ($178
billion) last year, the third-biggest annual  sum  on record,
after 20.43 trillion yen in 2003 and 14.83 trillion yen in 2004,
data from Japan’s Finance Ministry show.  The yen tends to strengthen during economic and financial
turmoil because the nation’s current-account surplus makes it
less reliant on foreign capital. A stronger domestic currency
hurts the overseas competitiveness of exporters and reduces the
value of their repatriated income.  The yen reached a post-World War II record of 75.35 against
the dollar on Oct. 31, and traded at 80.47 in  Tokyo  today.  “Japan has no choice but to add to Treasuries when they
conduct yen-selling intervention,” said Kengo Suzuki, a
foreign-exchange strategist in Tokyo at Mizuho Securities Co., a
unit of Japan’s third-largest bank by market value. “Should the
yen strengthen beyond 80, the authorities may start verbal
intervention, and they may consider doing it for real one once
it reaches the 76-level.”  Hong Kong ’s  Treasury holdings  rose 4.6 percent to $140.5
billion, while the U.K., which is often seen as a proxy for
Chinese demand, declined $11.1 billion, or 9.7 percent, to $103
billion.  The Fed remains the top holder of  U.S. debt  with $1.677
trillion on its balance sheet.  To contact the reporters on this story:
