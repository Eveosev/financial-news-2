Nine environmental groups say they
will ask a U.S. court to delay  Southern Co. (SO) ’s construction of
two reactors in Georgia after federal regulators denied their
bid to halt the $14 billion project.  The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and Friends of the
Earth are among groups that said they intend to ask the  U.S.
Court of Appeals  in  Washington  by April 18 to halt construction
at Southern’s Vogtle plant while the court considers a previous
legal challenge over the units.  The five-member  Nuclear Regulatory Commission , which
approved a license for the reactor on Feb. 9, today unanimously
rejected the groups’ petition challenging the decision. The NRC
action cleared the way to seek court action.  Southern plans to build two reactor at Vogtle, about 26
miles (42 kilometers) from Augusta,  Georgia . The environmental
groups have asked the appeals court to reject the licenses
because the agency hadn’t fully considered lessons from Japan’s
Fukushima Dai-Ichi disaster, caused by a March 2011 earthquake
and tsunami.  The request for a court stay “is an attempt to apply some
common sense to the whole process by saying that construction
should not proceed on this project while the court’s reviewing
our case,” Diane Curran, an attorney for the groups, said today
on a conference call with reporters. Changes to the reactors may
be needed if the court rules in the groups’ favor, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
