The German government’s draft
proposals aimed at closing loopholes in antitrust rules do not
go far enough to curb potential abuses, the Bonn-based Federal
Cartel Office President Andreas Mundt told  Handelsblatt .  While boosting the cartel office’s powers to punish
antitrust infringements, the new rules would still let companies
escape fines by closing down or restructuring units found guilty
of rule-breaking, Mundt is cited as saying in an interview.  Cabinet approved the draft antitrust rules last month with
a view to them becoming law in 2013, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
