The yuan weakened by the most in
almost three months after  China ’s central bank widened the
currency’s trading band for the first time since 2007 and
lowered its daily reference rate.  The currency dropped 0.31 percent to 6.3228 per dollar as
of 9:38 a.m. in  Shanghai . The People’s Bank of China cut its
daily fixing by 0.13 percent to 6.2960 after doubling the limit
of the currency’s moves to 1 percent from the reference rate.  The yuan fell as much as 0.43 percent from today’s fixing,
not making use of the new limit.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
