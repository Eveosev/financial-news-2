Bank of New York Mellon  Corp., the
world’s largest custody bank, was fined $6 million by the
 Federal Reserve  Board for misstating the collateral it pledged
to a government lending program in 2008.  A portion of the collateral the bank pledged to the Boston
Reserve Bank was ineligible for the Asset-Backed Commercial
Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, or AMLF, a
program set up to help ease the credit squeeze during the
financial crisis, the Federal Reserve said today in a press
release. As a result, BNY Mellon received more in loans than it
should have, according to the statement.  As part of a “consent cease and desist order,” the bank
agreed to submit a plan to the Fed to improve its procedures and
to step up training for its employees, according to the
statement.  “This situation resulted from a failure in our internal
reporting and escalation processes related to our use of the
program in 2008,”  Ron Gruendl , a spokesman for New York-based
BNY Mellon, said in an emailed statement. “We are pleased to
put this matter behind us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
