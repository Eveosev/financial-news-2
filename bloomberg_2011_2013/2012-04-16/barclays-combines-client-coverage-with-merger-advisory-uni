Barclays Plc (BARC)  combined investment-
banking units that oversee corporate client coverage and merger
advice in a bid to win bigger roles in deals.  Tom King and Ros Stephenson, who previously oversaw
corporate finance, will be co-heads of the new division
alongside  Paul Parker , the former head of mergers and
acquisitions, London-based Barclays said today in an internal
memo obtained by Bloomberg News.  “One specific objective here is to secure more lead left
financings and more transformational and ‘one stop’ M&A deals,”
Hugh “Skip” McGee, the head of investment banking, said in the
memo.  Kerrie Cohen, a spokeswoman for Barclays, confirmed the
memo’s contents.  Barclays was the fifth-biggest merger adviser globally in
2011, working on $327 billion of transactions, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The bank joined the ranks of the world’s
top underwriters and merger advisers with the acquisition of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s North American  investment
banking  business in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
