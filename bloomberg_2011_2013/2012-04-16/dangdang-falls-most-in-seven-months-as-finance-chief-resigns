E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG) , the
owner of  China ’s biggest Internet bookseller, fell the most in
10 months in New York trading as Chief Financial Officer Conor Chia-huang Yang resigned.  American depositary receipts of E-Commerce, known as
Dangdang, plunged 15 percent to $8.63, a two-week low, at the
close of trading in New York. It was the biggest one-day decline
since June 13.  Yang will stay with Dangdang for a period as long as three
months as it searches for a replacement, the company said in a
statement today. Dangdang spokeswoman Maria Xin could not be
immediately reached for comment after Chinese business hours.  Shares of Dangdang have gained 96 percent this year. The
stock slumped 84 percent in  New York  last year to $4.40, falling
below the December 2010 initial public offering price of $16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
