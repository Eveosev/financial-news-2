Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (ALIBABZ) .’s $3
billion loan to fund the privatization of its Hong Kong-listed
unit has attracted commitments from at least four banks in
senior syndication, said three people familiar with the matter.  Bank of East Asia Ltd. (23)  pledged $200 million while a
European bank pledged $300 million, the people said, declining
to elaborate and asking not to be identified because the details
are private. Morgan Stanley joined last week with a commitment
of $300 million.  Salina Tong, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Bank of East
Asia, declined to immediately comment on the commitment when
contacted by telephone today. John Spelich, a Hong Kong-based
spokesman for Alibaba, also declined to comment on the
financing.  Alibaba Group, run by billionaire Jack Ma, offered HK$13.50
($1.74) a share for the 27 percent it doesn’t already own in
 Alibaba.com Ltd. (1688) , according to a Feb. 21 regulatory filing to
the stock exchange.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) ,
Credit Suisse Group AG, DBS Bank Ltd., Deutsche Bank AG,  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. signed the loan to
finance the planned deal, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
