President Barack Obama’s re-
election effort raised more than $53 million in March, campaign
manager  Jim Messina  said in a video posted by the campaign on
YouTube this morning.  The campaign said it collected money from 567,000 donors in
March, 190,000 of whom were giving for the first time. The
average donation was $50.78 and 97 percent of the donations were
for $250 or less, the campaign said.  “This is really how this works,” Messina said in the
video. “People are building this organization five to 10 bucks
at a time to take on Mitt Romney.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
