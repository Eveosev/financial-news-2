Gold for June delivery in  New York 
advanced 0.2 percent to $1,653.60 an ounce at 8:06 a.m. in
Melbourne, while bullion for immediate delivery was little
changed at $1,652.82. Futures declined for a second straight
session yesterday as U.S. equities climbed, eroding demand for
the precious metal as a safe haven.  Silver for May delivery rose 0.4 percent to $31.485 an
ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
