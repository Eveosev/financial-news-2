Cephalon Inc. (TEVA)  won an appeals court
ruling that could help it block generic versions of the muscle-
relaxant Amrix.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
 Washington  today  said  a trial judge erred in invalidating two
patents on the medicine.  Mylan Inc. (MYL)  and  Par Pharmaceutical Cos. (PRX) ,
which won a patent challenge at the lower court, can seek
victory on other grounds, including allegations of patent misuse
and antitrust violations.  Cephalon, bought by  Petah Tikva , Israel-based Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. last year, and partner  Eurand NV (EURX) 
sought to block low-cost versions of the medicine from entering
the market until the patents expire in 2023 and 2025. They cover
a dosage form of a skeletal muscle relaxant and a method of
relieving muscle spasms.  Mylan began selling generic Amrix in May 2011 after winning
the ruling that the patents covered obvious variations of
earlier known research. U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson ordered
Mylan to hold off selling the drug until the appeals court
ruling. The Federal Circuit said that sales ban will remain in
effect until Robinson gets the case back.  Amrix generated $109 million in U.S. sales in 2010, before
the generic versions entered the market.  The case is Eurand Inc. v. Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
2011-1399 and 2011-1409,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal
Circuit (Washington. The lower court case is Cyclobenzaprine
Hydrochloride Patent Litigation, 09-2118, U.S. District Court,
District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patents, click: 7,387,793, 7,544,372.  To contact the reporters on this story:
