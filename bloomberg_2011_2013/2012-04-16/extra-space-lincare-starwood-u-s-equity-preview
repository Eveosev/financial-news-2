Inc. (ANR)   increased 3.9 percent to $16.13.  Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG)   rose 3.6 percent to $17.60,

formations struggle to find domestic buyers to absorb a glut.  Cobalt International Energy Inc. (CIE)   rose 4.1 percent,
the most since April 3, to $27.44. Morgan Stanley said the deep-
water oil explorer’s 7.2 percent decline yesterday was an
overreaction to concern over the company’s compliance with the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The company has “no risk of
losing its interest” in some Angola blocks under U.S. law,
analysts including Evan Calio wrote in a note. The company
denied breaking any laws after the Financial Times reported
Angolan officials own stakes in its local partner.  Coca-Cola Co. (KO)   rose the most since Aug. 23, rallying
2.1 percent to $73.95. The world’s largest soft-drink maker
reported first-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates,

quarter profit of 66 cents a share, beating analysts’ estimates
for a sixth straight quarter, according to Bloomberg data.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)   rallied 10 percent to $22.96 for
the biggest gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The largest
thin-film panel maker will cut 30 percent of its workforce,
about 2,000 jobs, as demand in  Europe  slows faster than the
company can expand in  emerging markets  in  Asia .  MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR)   climbed 8.4 percent
to $3.74.  NRG Energy Inc. (NRG)   rose 4.8 percent, the most since

products agreed to be bought by  DTS Inc. (DTSI)   in a cash-
and-stock transaction valued at $9.50 per share, or $148
million.  Starwood Property Trust Inc. (STWD)   decreased 2.7
percent to $20.37, the lowest price since March 1. The real
estate investment company will sell 20 million shares in a
public offering. Proceeds from the sale will be used to
originate and purchase commercial mortgage loans and other
assets, and for other general corporate purposes.  Teekay Tankers Ltd. (TNK)   gained 6.8 percent, the most
since March 28, to $5.80. The owner of crude-oil tankers agreed

tankers from Teekay Corp. (TK US) for $455 million.  Terex Corp. (TEX)   rose 6 percent to $23.51, the biggest
gain since March 13. The maker of cranes and construction
equipment was lifted to outperform from market perform at  Wells
Fargo & Co ., meaning the stock’s return is expected to beat the
market over the next 12 months.  Whirlpool Corp. (WHR)   fell 4.3 percent to $68 for the
second-biggest decline in the Russell 1000 Index. The U.S.
International Trade Commission voted in favor of LG Electronics
Inc. in a refrigerator case, finding refrigerators imported from
South Korea and  Mexico  didn’t cause “material injury” to the
U.S. industry. Whirlpool, based in Benton Harbor, Michigan, is
the world’s largest appliance maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
