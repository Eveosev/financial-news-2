OAO Gazprom (GAZP) , the biggest natural-
gas producer, plans to complete pricing talks with European
customers this year as energy clients seek to narrow the gap
between long-term supply contracts and spot-market charges.  “We continue negotiations on pricing where we have not yet
found any compromise solutions,” Dmitry Averkin, head of
Gazprom’s exports to north and southwest  Europe , said in the
Blue Fuel corporate magazine e-mailed today. “We are optimistic
on the outcome and hope solutions will be found this year.”  Customers including  Eni SpA (ENI)  and  EON AG (EOAN)  have sought changes
to their purchasing contracts with Gazprom since the 2008
recession caused a fuel surplus, dragging spot prices in Europe
below long-term contracts. Gazprom ties its contracts to prices
for crude and refined-oil products with a time lag of as long as
nine months.  German utilities EON and  RWE AG (RWE)  are embroiled in
arbitration with Gazprom over prices and volumes after losing
billions of euros buying fuel at above-market rates and selling
gas-fired power at a loss. The Russian supplier has already
agreed to adjust the pricing formula and curb rates for clients
including Wingas,  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA, Eni and Sinergie Italiane Srl.  Gazprom expects its European customers to buy at least 150
billion cubic meters of gas this year, the same volume that it
delivered in 2011, Averkin told the magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
