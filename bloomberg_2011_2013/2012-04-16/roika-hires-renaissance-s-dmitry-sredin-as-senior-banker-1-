Troika Dialog,  Russia ’s oldest
investment bank, said it hired Dmitry Sredin, formerly chairman
of Renaissance Advisors, as a senior banker for the firm’s
corporate investment unit  Sredin, who returns to Troika Dialog after three years at
Renaissance, will work with  OAO Sberbank’s (SBER)  corporate clients,
the company said in a statement today. Sberbank, Russia’s
largest lender, completed its acquisition of Troika Dialog on
Jan. 23 after agreeing to pay at least $1 billion.  Sberbank Chief Executive Officer  German Gref , a former
economy minister, is seeking to turn what was once the Soviet
Union’s savings bank into a full-service financial firm that can
compete at home and abroad in areas from bond underwriting to
 stock trading . Troika plans to increase its staff of about 100
bankers by about 40 percent this year, Todd Berman, head of
investment banking, said in a Nov. 29 interview.  Sredin is the second senior hire by Moscow-based Troika
from Renaissance this year. Ovanes Oganisian, who worked at
 Renaissance Capital  for 14 years as an equity strategist, joined
in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
