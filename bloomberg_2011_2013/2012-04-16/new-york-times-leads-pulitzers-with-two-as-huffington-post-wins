The  New York  Times led the Pulitzer
Prizes with two awards, winning for international and
explanatory reporting, as online publications the  Huffington
Post  and Politico won their first awards.  Times reporter David Kocieniewski won for a series that
explained how wealthy U.S. citizens avoided taxes and exploited
loopholes. The Times, owned by  New York Times Co. (NYT) , was also
awarded for Jeffrey Gettleman’s reporting about famine and
conflict in East Africa.  The 96th annual Pulitzer Prizes for excellence in reporting
and the arts were announced today by Columbia University’s
Graduate School of Journalism in New York.  Huffington Post, founded by  Arianna Huffington  in 2005, was
recognized for its series on American soldiers wounded in Iraq
and  Afghanistan . The digital news site, which also aggregates
reporting from other news outlets, was acquired by  AOL Inc. (AOL)  last
year. Online news outlet Politico won for editorial cartooning.  The  Philadelphia Inquirer  won in the public service
category for its seven-part series,  “Assault on Learning,”  about
growing violence in Philadelphia schools. The Stranger, a
Seattle weekly, was awarded for Eli Sanders’s feature on a woman
who survived a criminal attack.  A committee of editors, publishers, writers and educators
voted on the winners in 21 categories of journalism, letters,
drama and music. Winners in all categories except public service
receive a $10,000 cash award. The public-service prize, awarded
to a news organization, is a gold medal.  There was no winner in the editorial writing category.
Finalists for that award included  Paula Dwyer  and Mark Whitehouse of Bloomberg News for “their analysis of and
prescription for the European debt crisis,” according to the
Pulitzer board statement.  The fiction category also had no winner.  Below is a table of 2012 Pulitzer Prize winners.  JOURNALISM CATEGORIES  PUBLIC SERVICE The Philadelphia Inquirer for its seven-part
