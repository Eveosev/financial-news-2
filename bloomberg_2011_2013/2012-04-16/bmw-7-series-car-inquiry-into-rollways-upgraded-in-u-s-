U.S. auto-safety regulators
upgraded their inquiry into  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s 7
Series cars that may roll away when parked as they probe
transmission defects in an electronic access and ignition
system.  The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
said today on its website that it’s intensifying an
investigation it opened in August of about 120,000 vehicles to
an engineering analysis, which can lead to vehicle recalls. Some
drivers said their 7 Series cars from model years 2002 to 2008
rolled away when they thought the transmissions were in park.  The regulator, in the Web posting, said it found 14 crashes
and five injuries in data BMW provided and two more reports of
crashes from rollaway cars in its database.  “BMW is fully cooperating with NHTSA on the engineering
analysis,” Dave Butchko, a U.S. spokesman for Munich-based BMW,
said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
