The European Union’s “recession-
busting” wind power industry is forecast to triple in value as
its  labor force  doubles in the 10 years through 2020, the
European  Wind Energy  Association said.  The contribution of the wind industry to the economy of the
27-nation EU will rise to 94.5 billion euros ($123 billion) in
2020 from 32.4 billion euros in 2010, the lobby group, known as
EWEA, said today in a  report  published in Copenhagen at the
start of its annual conference. Jobs supported by the industry
will jump to 520,000 from 238,154, it said.  “Wind energy is a recession-busting industry,” EWEA
President Arthouros Zervos said in a statement. It is
“providing increasing economic activity, more jobs and exports
every year to an EU struggling with an economic crisis
intensified by ever-increasing amounts of fuel being imported at
rising costs.”  The EU is chasing a target of getting 20 percent of all
energy for power, heating and transport from renewables by 2020.
The contribution of the wind industry to EU economic output
increased by a third in 2010 from 2007, according to today’s
report. EWEA said Feb. 6 that wind power capacity expanded more
than 10 percent last year with 21 percent of the bloc’s new
power capacity coming from wind.  Increased Competition  Even so, the industry has struggled in recent months amid
increased competition, and as European governments work to rein
in budget deficits.  Spain , with just under a quarter of the EU’s
wind farms, in January suspended subsidies to new developments.
In its February report, EWEA said investment in the industry was
unchanged at about 12.6 billion euros in 2011.  EWEA called for “stable national renewable energy
frameworks” and a joined up European  power grid  to spur the
industry further as well as a target to cut  greenhouse gases  in
the bloc by 30 percent for the 30 years through 2020, up from
the current goal of a 20-percent reduction.  The continent’s two biggest turbine makers, Aarhus,
Denmark-based  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  and  Gamesa Corp.
Tecnologica SA (GAM)  of Zamudio, Spain, have both shed more than 60
percent of their value in the past year as competition from
 China  helped crimp margins. Navigant Consulting Inc.’s BTM
Consult said March 26 that they were the biggest and fourth-
largest turbine makers by market share in 2011.  The industry now contributes 0.26 percent of European
economic output, according to today’s report. By 2020, wind
power will contribute 0.59 percent of EU economic output, rising
to almost 1 percent a decade later, it said.  Net exports for wind totaled 5.7 billion euros in 2010, and
the industry saved the bloc an identical amount in fossil fuel
bills, according to the report.  EWEA included wind farm developers, turbine makers and
component manufacturers in its study, as well as jobs and
economic output relating to transportation of the turbines, and
the electronics and metals used in them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
