Air Mauritius Ltd. (AML) , sub-Saharan
Africa’s fourth-biggest airline, has appointed Derek Shanks
chief commercial officer.  As part of Shanks’s responsibilities, he will be team
leader for the company’s restructuring, the Port Louis-based
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  The airline is implementing a new business model, with cuts
in long-haul flights and plans to sell a jetliner as it seeks to
return to profitability by the 2013-2014 financial year.  It is “important to have one restructuring team leader to
achieve effective implementation of all planned improvements,”
Acting Chief Executive Officer Andre Viljoen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
