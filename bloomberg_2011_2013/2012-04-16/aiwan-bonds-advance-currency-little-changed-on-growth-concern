Taiwan ’s dollar weakened, snapping
a three-day advance, as concern the global economic recovery is
losing momentum saw investors favor the safest assets.  Global funds sold $97 million more Taiwanese stocks than
they bought today, bringing net sales for the month to more than
$1.1 billion, according to exchange data.  South Korea ’s central
bank lowered its 2012 economic growth forecast to 3.5 percent
today from a December estimate of 3.7 percent. Taiwan’s
 benchmark  five-year yields reached 1.044 percent on April 13,
the highest level since November.  “Some investors are still worried about the economic
outlook,” said  James Wang , a debt trader at Yuanta Securities
Co. in Taipei. “Banks have been looking for chances to buy
bonds. There’s some bargain hunting after yields reached a
relatively high level last week.”  Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.1 percent to NT$29.564 against
its U.S. counterpart, and touched a one-week low of NT$29.600,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings traders use to price options,
was steady at 3.90 percent.  The yield on the government’s 1 percent securities due
January 2017 fell to 1.042 percent from 1.044 percent on April
13, according to Gretai Securities Market.  The overnight  money-market  rate was little changed at 0.481
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
