New York Rangers  forward Carl
Hagelin was suspended three games by the  National Hockey League 
for elbowing Ottawa’s Daniel Alfredsson in the head during Game
2 of their first-round playoff series.  Hagelin was assessed a major penalty for elbowing as a
result of the incident, which occurred at 10:32 of the second
period in the Senators’ 3-2 overtime victory two days ago.  The Rangers said in a statement they accept the penalty and
won’t pursue an appeal, yet are “thoroughly perplexed in the
ruling’s inconsistency” with other discipline decisions.  Senators forward Matt Carkner was suspended one game by the
NHL yesterday for a Game 2 incident in which he threw repeated
punches at  New York ’s  Brian Boyle , who the league said was an
“unwilling combatant.”  Carkner instigated the altercation with Boyle, knocking him
to the ice with two punches and then continuing to throw punches
at his opponent until officials intervened. Carkner was assessed
a minor penalty for instigating, a major penalty for fighting
and a game misconduct.  The best-of-seven first-round series is tied at 1-1, with
Ottawa hosting Game 3 tonight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
