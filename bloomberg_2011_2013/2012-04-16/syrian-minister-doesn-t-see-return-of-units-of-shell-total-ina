Units of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,
 Total SA (FP)  and  INA Industrija Nafte d.d. , the Croatian refiner
controlled by Hungary’s  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) , won’t be able to return to
 Syria  after complying with a European Union embargo, Syrian Oil
Minister Sufian Al-Alao said, according to  Vecernji List .  “I don’t believe that the companies which betrayed us,
such as INA, Shell and Total, will ever return to Syria,” Alao
was quoted as saying in an interview from Damascus with the
Zagreb-based newspaper. “If there is no trust, doing business
becomes impossible, and we have lost trust in these three
companies.”  The EU banned imports of crude oil from Syria in September
in an expansion of sanctions against President Bashar al-Assad’s
government for its deadly crackdown on protesters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
