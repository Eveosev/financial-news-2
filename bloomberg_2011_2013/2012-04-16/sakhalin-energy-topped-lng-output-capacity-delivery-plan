OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  and its partners in the
Sakhalin-2 project produced more than 10.6 million tons of
liquefied natural gas last year, exceeding designed capacity by
10 percent after a nuclear disaster in  Japan  boosted demand.  Sakhalin Energy Investment Co. Ltd., operator of the
project on Russia’s Sakhalin Island, shipped 162 cargoes of LNG
last year compared with 150 tankers planned, Andrey Galaev, the
venture’s chief executive officer, told Blue Fuel, a corporate
magazine of Gazprom’s export unit, in a copy e-mailed today. One
standard cargo is 145,000 cubic meters of LNG, he said.  Demand for LNG, gas chilled to liquid to ease
transportation, has soared in Japan,  South Korea  and Asia after
a March 2011 earthquake and tsunami led to the Fukushima nuclear
disaster and raised Japan’s need for other fuels. The Sakhalin-2
plant with a designed capacity of 9.6 million tons of the fuel a
year is Russia’s only LNG producing facility.  The facility adjusted equipment for “de-bottlenecking,” a
practice that helps increase output by as much as 10 percent,
Galaev said in the magazine.  Sakhalin Energy shipped 34 cargoes more than planned to
Japan last year, some diverted from other buyers, Galaev said.  Gazprom’s partners in the project are  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA) ,  Mitsui & Co. (8031)  and  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)   To contact the reporter on this story:
