Nigeria ’s naira strengthened to its
highest in more than five weeks after the central bank sold
dollars to lenders.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer appreciated
0.1 percent to 157.36 per dollar as of 4:02 p.m. on the
 interbank market  in Lagos, the commercial capital, its strongest
since March 9, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $150 million at a foreign-
currency auction today, with lenders buying the entire amount on
sale, the Abuja-based bank said in an e-mailed statement. The
marginal rate, which is also used as the prevailing exchange
rate, strengthened 0.1 percent to 155.69 naira, it said. The
central bank which sells foreign currency at auctions on Mondays
and Wednesdays to stabilize the naira is the major supplier of
foreign exchange, followed by  oil companies .  “Dollar sales by the central bank augmented oil industry
supply to support the naira,” Sewa Wusu, a currency analyst at
lagos-based Sterling Capital Ltd., said by phone today.  The bank only held one auction for the dollar last week as
April 9 was a public holiday.  Nigeria sold 183.7 billion naira ($1.2 billion) of Treasury
bills on April 11 and 80 billion naira of bills at its open-
market operations, the central bank said April 12.  “The naira remains well supported, owing to consistent
dollar inflows coupled with regular offerings by major oil firms
on the interbank market,” Celeste Fauconnier and Nema Ramkhelawan-Bhana, Africa strategists at Rand Merchant Bank in
Johannesburg, wrote in a report today.  Nigeria’s foreign-exchange reserves rose 9.5 percent this
year to $36.5 billion as of April 12, according to data compiled
by the central bank.  Borrowing costs on domestic 2019 bonds declined 5 basis
points, or 0.3 percent, to 15.24 percent, according to April 13
prices on the Financial Markets Dealers Association website.
Yields on the West African nation’s $500 million of dollar bonds
were unchanged at 5.509 percent in  London .  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated 0.3 percent to 1.8045 per dollar
as of 4:01 p.m. in Accra, the lowest on record since at least
June 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
