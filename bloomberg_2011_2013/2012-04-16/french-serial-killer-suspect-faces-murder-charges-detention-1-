The main suspect in a series of
killings in the region of Essonne, neighboring Paris, will face
murder charges today, after police found evidence linking him to
the crimes, a prosecutor said.  The 33-year-old hasn’t admitted the killings during three
rounds of questioning since being detained Saturday, Marie-
Suzanne Le Queau, the prosecutor, said during a televised press
conference. She didn’t identify the suspect by name.  Two women and two men have been murdered in Essonne since
November. The first woman’s death differed from the others and
is being separately investigated, though ballistics tests showed
the same gun was used in all four killings, Le Queau said.
Authorities are awaiting further evidence to see if there is a
link between the cases beyond the gun and the fact the first two
victims were killed in the same place, she said.  There is a “geographic proximity” between the victims and
the suspect, she said. It is unclear whether he acted alone, she
said. During his detention, police found a motorcycle and helmet
matching the description of the killer provided by several
witnesses, weapons and a cartridge from the gun used in the
killings, she said.  The suspect had six prior convictions, including one for
violent assault in 2004, she said.  A second suspect was released yesterday evening after
investigators determined he was a victim of  identity theft , Le
Queau said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
