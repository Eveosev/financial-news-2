The Australian and New Zealand
dollars fell for a third day as concern that  Europe ’s debt
crisis is worsening sapped investor demand for riskier assets.  The so-called Aussie declined against 15 of its 16 major
peers after minutes of the  Reserve Bank  of Australia’s last
meeting signaled that the central bank is ready to cut  interest
rates  if inflation eases. The New Zealand currency, known as the
kiwi, dropped to the weakest in almost six weeks against the yen
after global shares fell yesterday when Spain’s borrowing costs
climbed to the highest this year, dimming the outlook for the
European nation’s debt sales this week.  “The concerns will build over the next couple of months in
Spain,” said Derek Mumford, a director in Sydney at Rochford
Capital, a currency risk management company. “There’s a lot of
problems to be sorted out there. I would be looking for a test
of $1.02 in the next couple of weeks” for the Aussie.  Australia’s dollar fell 0.4 percent to $1.0317 as of 3:33
p.m. in Sydney, dropping for a third day. It slid 0.4 percent to
82.96 yen after weakening 0.8 percent yesterday.  New Zealand ’s
currency declined 0.6 percent to 81.58 U.S. cents. The kiwi
touched 65.57 yen, the weakest since March 7, before trading 0.5
percent lower than yesterday’s close at 65.60.  Australian bonds pared earlier gains, with the yield on 10-
year debt at 3.8 percent, little changed from yesterday after
earlier rising by as much as three basis points. The rate on
three-year debt was at 3.2 percent. New Zealand’s two-year swap
rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating rates, was at 2.9
percent.  Spanish Auction  Spanish 10-year  bond yields  jumped as much as 18 basis
points, or 0.18 percentage point, to 6.16 percent yesterday, the
highest since Dec. 1. Five-year credit-default swaps linked to
Spanish bonds reached an all-time high, CMA data show.  Spain  is
scheduled to sell 364-day and 546-day bills today and debt
maturing 2014 and 2022 on April 19.  “Members had lowered their assessment of the pace of
growth somewhat,” RBA minutes released today. “If slower
growth in demand could be expected to result in a more moderate
inflation outcome, then a case could be made for further easing
of monetary policy.”  The central bank on April 3 held its benchmark interest
rate unchanged at 4.25 percent.  RBA Minutes  “The RBA definitely remains on an easing bias and that was
enough to take the shine off of the Aussie dollar,” said
 Jonathan Cavenagh , a Singapore-based currency strategist at
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) ,  Australia ’s second-biggest lender.
“Given that the market was already largely priced for an
easing, I still expect demand to come back around the
$1.0310-$1.0320 region.”  A  Credit Suisse Group AG index  based on swaps shows traders
are betting the central bank will lower rates by 96 basis
points, or 0.96 percentage point, over the next 12 months. That
compares to 38 basis points of cuts indicated March 20.  The  implied volatility  of three-month options for Group of
Seven currencies rose as high as 10 percent yesterday, according
to the JPMorgan G7  Volatility Index . An increase makes
investments in currencies with higher benchmark rates less
attractive because it shows the risk is greater that market
moves will erase profits on such trades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
