Portugal ’s energy regulator
proposed increasing natural gas tariffs for domestic users by
6.9 percent for the six months starting in July.  The proposed rate applies to homes and other consumers
using 500 cubic meters or less a year, the Lisbon-based Energy
Services Regulatory Agency said in a statement today. A final
decision on the price will be taken by June 15.  Portugal will end most regulated tariffs by January 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
