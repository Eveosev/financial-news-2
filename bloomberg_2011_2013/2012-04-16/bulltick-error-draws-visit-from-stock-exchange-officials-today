Officials from the Mexican stock
exchange and the National Banking and Securities Commission are
visiting Bulltick Capital Markets’s local brokerage today to
review its systems, according to Alejandro Creixell, a managing
partner at the firm.  Bulltick was suspended from Mexico trading pending a review
after erroneous trades sparked a late-day plunge on the
benchmark IPC index on April 13. The trades were later canceled
by exchange officials.  Creixell, speaking in a telephone interview from Mexico
City, said the selloff was caused by the execution of 8,000
erroneous basket transactions, or transactions involving many
stocks at the same time. The firm’s backstop mechanisms failed
to catch the mistake, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
