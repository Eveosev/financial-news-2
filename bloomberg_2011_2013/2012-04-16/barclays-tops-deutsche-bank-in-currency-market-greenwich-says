Barclays Plc (BARC)  bested  Deutsche Bank (DB) 
AG as the world’s largest currency trader by market share as of
November, according to a Greenwich Associates survey.  Barclays, the U.K.’s second-biggest bank by assets,
controlled 10.5 percent of the foreign-exchange market in the
global survey conducted between September and November 2011,
followed by Deutsche Bank with 9.8 percent,  Citigroup (C)  Inc. with
9.3 percent,  UBS AG (UBSN)  with 8.2 percent,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  with 7.6
percent and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  with 7.5 percent. Deutsche Bank
held the top spot in the previous study, with 10.7 percent of
global flows.  Citigroup was the No. 1 dealer for corporate entities while
Barclays led among financial-service institutions such as  hedge
funds  and insurance companies.  Greenwich Associates, a research company based in Stamford,
Connecticut, tracks foreign-exchange trading volume among 1,632
end-user corporate and institutional customers. Volume figures
calculated in its research exclude inter-bank and other trades
between market counterparties. Greenwich Associates said it also
generally excludes short dated roll-over trades in its official
customer trading calculations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
