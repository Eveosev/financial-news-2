Ethanol futures slumped to a two-
week low in  Chicago  as corn and gasoline declined.  Futures sank as the motor fuel declined after international
talks with  Iran  over its nuclear program led to an agreement to
reconvene in May, easing concern that crude supplies will be
disrupted. Separately, corn, the primary ingredient used to make
the biofuel in the U.S., fell on speculation favorable weather
will boost crops.  “We didn’t get much help from anything today,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa .
“You had the gasoline market fall apart, so no help there. With
no help out of corn or energies, we just sank.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery declined 2 cents, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $2.197 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the lowest price since March 29. Futures have fallen 0.3
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast slipped
2.5 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.33 a gallon, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. In  New York , the additive decreased 2.5
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.255.  Ethanol in Chicago plummeted 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$2.185 a gallon, and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel fell 0.5 cent
to $2.245.  Corn futures for July delivery declined 1.2 percent to
close at $6.1325 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade.  Gasoline for May delivery dropped 7.91 cents, or 2.4
percent, to settle at $3.267 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, or RBOB,
which is mixed with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
