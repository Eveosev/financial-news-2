Halozyme Therapeutics Inc. (HALO)  plunged
the most in almost eight years after U.S. regulators requested
more information on the company’s blood product used to boost
weak immune systems, delaying the treatment’s possible approval.  Halozyme declined 24 percent to $8.56 at the close of New
York trading, its biggest  drop  since August 2004. The San Diego-
based company is developing the injection of immune globulin
with  Baxter (BAX)  International Inc., whose shares fell the most in
two years.  Halozyme and Baxter said the U.S.  Food and Drug
Administration  asked for more information about the treatment,
known as HyQ. The experimental drug is used to boost patients’
defense against diseases, with Deerfield, Illinois-based Baxter.
They will have to do more studies about long-term use of the
drug, and said they also expect to go before an outside panel
that advises the FDA.  “The companies expect these requests to require additional
time to complete and to delay the companies’ anticipated
regulatory review and approval timeline,” Halozyme and Baxter
said in a statement today.  HyQ is in the third of three stages of testing usually
required for approval by U.S. regulators.  Baxter, based in Deerfield,  Illinois , declined 6.8 percent
to $54.10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
