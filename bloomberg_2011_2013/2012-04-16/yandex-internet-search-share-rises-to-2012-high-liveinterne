Yandex NV (YNDX) , Russia’s most popular
Internet search engine, saw its weekly search-market share rise
to the highest this year, while Mail.ru Group Ltd.’s portion
fell for a third consecutive week and  Google Inc.’s (GOOG)  share
declined, data compiled by  Liveinternet.ru  show.  Yandex’s share of the Russian online search market rose for
a third straight week, gaining to 60.6 percent in the period
through April 15, the highest since the five days to Dec. 25,
according to Liveinternet, an Internet-service provider and
researcher. Yandex’s share averaged 59.9 percent over the past
four weeks, the data showed.  Google Inc.’s share of Russian searches fell for the first
time in five weeks, dropping to 25.6 percent from 26.1 percent
in the previous period, for a four-week average of 25.9 percent,
according to Liveinternet.  The market share of  Mail.ru (MAIL)  Group Ltd., the largest
Russian-language  Internet company , fell to 8.5 percent from 8.8
percent in the previous week, while the four-week average was 9
percent, the data showed.  Yandex’s  U.S.-traded shares  rose 0.5 percent to $26.68 at

offering, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “We see it as positive that Yandex’s share of search is
improving,” David Ferguson, an analyst at  Renaissance Capital 
in Moscow, wrote in an e-mailed report today. “With the
Internet advertising market remaining robust, we expect Yandex
to report strong first-quarter results on April 26.”  Global depositary receipts of Mail.ru rose 0.5 percent to
$40.80 in  London , bringing this year’s gain to 57 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Yandex  is trading  at 32 times
