GMA Network Inc. (GMA7)  rose the most in
two months in Manila trading after the Philippine Star newspaper
said  Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (TEL)  Chairman Manuel Pangilinan offered to buy the broadcaster for 45 billion pesos
($1.1 billion).  GMA advanced 7.7 percent to close at 9.10 pesos, the
biggest gain since Feb. 13. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index
rose 0.4 percent. Shares of the nation’s largest broadcast
company by market value have added 38 percent this year amid
speculation that Pangilinan was interested in buying GMA.  Pangilinan offered as much as 45 billion pesos, while
owners of GMA are asking for 55 billion pesos, Philippine Star
reported April 14, citing people it didn’t identify. GMA will
consider purchase offers if the price is right, Chairman Felipe Gozon said in a Feb. 22 interview.  “We are presently not in serious negotiations with the
PLDT group as we have not yet received an offer price that is
acceptable to us,” Gilberto Duavit, president and chief
operating officer of GMA, said in an e-mailed statement today.
“The network is not for sale but that is not to say it may not
be sold, depending on the offer price.”  A media venture of PLDT called Mediaquest Holdings Inc.
came close to buying a controlling stake in GMA in 2001.  To contact the reporters on this story:
