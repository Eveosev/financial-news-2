Cotton futures slid to the lowest
since late December amid signs of slowing demand for supplies
from the U.S., while expected rainfall boosted the outlook for
crops in  Texas . Orange juice advanced.  In the week ended April 5, order cancellations for upland
cotton resulted in a net reduction in export sales of 39,863
bales, the second consecutive drop, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said April 12. The economy in  China , the world’s
biggest user of the fiber, grew 8.1 percent last quarter, less
than the 8.4 percent anticipated by economists surveyed by
Bloomberg, the government said last week.  “The export sales were horrible last week,” Scott Joss,
the president of ClearTrade Commodities Inc. in  Chicago , said in
a telephone interview. “A lot of commodities are also showing
weakness.”  Cotton for July delivery tumbled 2.8 percent to settle at
87.25 cents a pound at 3:15 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . Earlier, the price touched 86.55 cents, the lowest for a
most-active contract since Dec. 21. A bale weighs 480 pounds, or
218 kilograms.  Showers and thunderstorms from the Tennessee Valley to
southern Texas today and tomorrow will total 0.25 inch (0.6
centimeter) to 1 inch, according to AccuWeather. The forecast
for rains in Texas, the top producing state, hurt prices,  Mike Stevens , an independent trader in Mandeville, Louisiana, said in
an e-mail.  Multiple closings below 87 cents may signal more declines
toward 84 cents, Joss said. After that, the commodity may slide
to the 76 cents to 77 cents, he said.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
dropped as much as 1.3 percent.  Orange-juice  futures for July delivery gained 0.3 percent
to $1.4625 a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
