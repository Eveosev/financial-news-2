(Corrects Phillies win total in third paragraph.)  The  St. Louis Cardinals  have
immortalized the “Rally Squirrel” on their championship rings
for winning the  World Series  last season.  A squirrel ran onto the field at St. Louis’s Busch Stadium
twice during the Cardinals’ 2011 National League Division Series
against Philadelphia, including one incident in which it
 streaked across home plate  in Game 4 after a pitch was thrown.  The Cardinals won the final two games of the best-of-five
playoff series to eliminate the Phillies, who had a Major League
Baseball-best 102 wins during the regular season, and went on to
win their 11th World Series title.  The Cardinals included the runaway squirrel on one side of
their  championship rings , with a representation of the rodent
appearing beneath the team logo and above two interlocking bats
featuring the player’s number.  The Cardinals received their World Series during a ceremony
before their April 14 game against the  Chicago Cubs .  To contact the reporter on this story:
