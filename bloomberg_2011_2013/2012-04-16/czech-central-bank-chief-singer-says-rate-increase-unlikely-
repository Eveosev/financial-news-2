Czech central bank governor
Miroslav Singer said  interest rates  are “unlikely” to be
increased soon.  “We are relatively unlikely to go up in the foreseeable
future,” Singer said at a panel discussion in Vienna today.  Singer said he expects the Czech economy to stagnate this
year with “mildly positive numbers” and growth “something
close to 2 percent” next year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
