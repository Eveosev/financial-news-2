German solar-energy installations
more than tripled in the first quarter as developers raced to
beat subsidy cuts,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Germany  added almost 1,900 megawatts of panels in the
period, compared with 513 megawatts a year earlier, the
newspaper said. The government plans to reduce solar subsidies
in the country, the second-biggest market for the industry,
starting April 1.  The Bundesnetzagentur grid regulator and the  Environment
Ministry  didnâ€™t immediately return calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
