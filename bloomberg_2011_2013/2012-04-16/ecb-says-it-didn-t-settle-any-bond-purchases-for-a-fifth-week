The  European Central Bank  said it
didn’t settle any government bond purchases for the fifth
straight week.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said it will take seven-day term
deposits tomorrow to absorb the 214 billion euros ($279 billion)
of liquidity created since the program started in May 2010, a
practice it employs to ensure the purchases don’t fuel
inflation.  The ECB halted the bond-buying program after its two three-
year loans to banks totaling more than 1 trillion euros helped
debt markets to rally. Now investors have begun to doubt if
 Spain  can bring its deficit under control, driving the nation’s
borrowing costs to the highest levels this year.  Jaime Garcia-Legaz, a deputy in Spain’s Economy Ministry,
called on the ECB to restart its bond purchases in an interview
on April 13. “They should step up purchases of bonds,” he said.  While ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure signaled on
April 11 the bank may start buying Spanish bonds, his Dutch
colleague Klaas Knot said April 13 that the ECB is “very far”
from reactivating a policy that failed to stop a selloff in
Spanish bonds in November. “I hope we never have to use it
again,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
