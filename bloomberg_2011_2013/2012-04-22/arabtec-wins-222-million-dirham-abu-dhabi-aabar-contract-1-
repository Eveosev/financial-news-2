Aabar Investments PJSC, which
dropped a $1.74 billion offer for  Arabtec (ARTC)  Holding PJSC two years
ago, awarded a 222 million-dirham contract ($60 million) to a
unit of the Dubai builder as it raises its stake in the company.  Arabtec Construction LLC won the contract to build a
residential tower in  Abu Dhabi , Arabtec said in a  statement  to
the Dubai bourse today. “With the recent award to the company
in Dubai and others expected in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the  United
Arab Emirates ’ is still an important market for the company,”
Arabtec Construction Chief Executive Officer Greg Christofides
said in the statement.  Aabar Chairman Khadem Alqubaisi, Chief Executive Officer
Mohamed Badawy Al-Husseiny, and board members Mohamed Al Fahim
and Mohamed Al Mehairi were nominated to Arabtec’s board,
according to a statement on the Dubai bourse on April 12. Aabar,
through its units, holds  10.5 percent of Arabtec , the latest
filings on the stock exchange show.  Aabar, which owns stakes in Daimler AG and UniCredit SpA,
in 2010 pulled a bid for a 70 percent of Arabtec through the
purchase of bonds that would be exchanged for shares. After the
deal fell through, Arabtec and Aabar said they planned a
“strategic partnership.”  Arabtec shares  gained 3.6 percent to 3.46 dirhams in Dubai
on April 19. The stock has surged 118 percent this year
compared with a 21 percent increase for the benchmark  DFM
General Index. (DFMGI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
