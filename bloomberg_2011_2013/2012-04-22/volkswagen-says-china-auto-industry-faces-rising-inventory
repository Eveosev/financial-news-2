Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Europe ’s largest
carmaker, said  China ’s slowing automobile industry is facing
rising inventory levels.  China’s auto market had inventory of about 2.3 months
during the first quarter, compared with 2 months a year earlier,
Soh Weiming, executive vice president at Volkswagen China, said
in Beijing today. Stockpiles may rise to 2.6 months by the
middle of the year, he said. Volkswagen’s own inventory is at
about 1.4 months, according to a company presentation.  Sales in the world’s biggest vehicle market  shrank  during
the first quarter, prompting an official at China’s Association
of Automobile Manufacturers to say last month that industrywide
deliveries may miss CAAM’s 8 percent growth forecast this year.
Average prices of cars produced in China have fallen for three
straight months as rising gasoline costs deter purchases.  VW, which owns brands from its namesake marque to supercar
maker Lamborghini, is looking for growth in China to help it
compete with  General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  for the
global sales crown.  The Wolfsburg, Germany-based company boosted deliveries in
the country 16 percent to more than 633,000 vehicles in the
first quarter of the year, compared with a decline in total
industry deliveries.  Volkswagen said it’s sticking to its projections for
China’s car market to grow 5 percent to 10 percent this year,
Soh said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
