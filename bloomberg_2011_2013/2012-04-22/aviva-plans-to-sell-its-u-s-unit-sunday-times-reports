Aviva Plc (AV/)  may sell its U.S. unit
for a price that won’t exceed 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion),
the Sunday Times reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Aviva Chief Executive Officer Andrew Moss may announce the
sale at an investor day on May 24, the newspaper reported. The
sale will crystallize a 1 billion-pound loss for Aviva on the
unit, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
