Nick Swisher  and Mark Teixeira
combined to drive in 12 runs, sparking the New York Yankees to
overcome a nine-run deficit and defeat the Boston Red Sox 15-9.  The Yankees (9-6) were down 9-0 through five innings of
their Major League Baseball contest today before Teixeira hit a
solo home run in the sixth inning at Boston’s Fenway Park.  Swisher hit a grand slam in the seventh inning followed by
Teixeira’s home run that drove in  Robinson Cano  and  Alex Rodriguez  to narrow the deficit to one run.  Swisher gave the Yankees their first lead of the game, 10-9,
in the eighth with a two-run double before Teixeira’s ground-
rule double sent home Swisher and Cano.  Russell Martin  hit a
two-run double and scored on an infield single by Derek Jeter as
the Yankees recorded back-to-back seven-run innings.  The Yankees had trailed 9-0 in the fifth after Cody Ross
hit a two-run homer for Boston (4-10).  Rafael Soriano (2-0) allowed one hit and struck out one in
an inning for the win. Alfredo Aceves (0-1) came in for the Red
Sox in the eighth inning and surrendered five runs on two hits
while walking four to take the loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
