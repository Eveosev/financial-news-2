The  Boston Red Sox , mired in a
five-game losing streak, acquired outfielder Marlon Byrd from
the Chicago Cubs in exchange for right-handed pitcher Michael Bowden.  The Red Sox also received cash from the Cubs and gave
Chicago a player to be named later, General Manager  Ben Cherington  said. To make room on the roster for Byrd,
infielder/outfielder Nate Spears was designated for assignment.  The Red Sox gave up a nine-run lead yesterday to take their
fifth straight defeat, a 15-9 loss to the  New York Yankees  at
Fenway Park.  Byrd, 34, a 2010 All-Star selection, has a .278 career
average with 215 doubles, 27 triples, 81 home runs, 438 runs
batted in, 516 runs, 274 walks and 49 stolen bases in 1,069
Major League Baseball games over 11 seasons. He played with the
 Philadelphia Phillies  from 2002-05, the Washington Nationals
from 2005-06, the Texas Rangers from 2007-09 and the Chicago
Cubs from 2010-11).  Bowden, 25, was designated for assignment by Boston on
April 15 after posting a 3.00 earned run average in two relief
appearances this season.  Spears, 26, has gone 0-4 after appearing in four games with
the Red Sox since being added to the roster on April 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
