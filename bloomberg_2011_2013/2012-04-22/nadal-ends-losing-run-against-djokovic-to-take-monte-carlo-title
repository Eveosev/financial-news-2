Spain’s  Rafael Nadal  beat top-
ranked Novak Djokovic in straight sets today to win the Monte
Carlo Masters for an eighth straight year and end a seven-match
losing run against the Serb.  Nadal, No. 2 in the ATP World Tour tennis rankings, won 6-
3, 6-1 as he collected a 47th career title. The 25-year-old has
won 42 straight matches at the tournament.  “It’s unbelievable to win this historic tournament eight
times,” Nadal told  Agence France-Presse . “I always feel great
when I come here.”  Nadal was without a victory against Djokovic since the
final of the U.S. Open in 2010. All their subsequent meetings
have been in finals, with their most recent encounter in
January’s Australian Open -- the longest Grand Slam decider in
history.  He moves to a career record of 33-4 in clay-court finals
and is the third-most successful men’s player on the surface in
the open era.  Djokovic started today’s match by winning the opening game
to love before Nadal took control. After taking the first set,
Nadal raced into a 4-0 lead in the second and finished with an
ace on match point.  “I’m sorry for my performance today, Rafa played well and
deserved to win,” Djokovic told AFP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
