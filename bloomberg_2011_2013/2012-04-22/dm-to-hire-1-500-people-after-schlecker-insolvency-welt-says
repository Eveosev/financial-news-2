DM-Drogerie Markt GmbH plans to
hire 1,500 people this year as the German drugstore chain opens
new stores,  Welt  reported in a preview of an article that will
run tomorrow, citing Chief Executive Officer Erich Harsch.  DM doesnâ€™t plan a takeover of most of the stores of rival
Schlecker after its insolvency as 95 to 98 percent of them are
too small, Harsch said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
