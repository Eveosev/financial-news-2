Hungary may receive approval from
the European Union to start bailout talks with the  International
Monetary Fund  this month, allowing an agreement to be reached by
the end of June,  HVG  said, citing an unidentified EU official.  The 27-member bloc will set “tough criteria” for starting
the talks and the country may only be able to draw on any future
 credit line  if it meets all the EU’s requests, according to the
news website.  Hungary may face further infringement procedures regarding
the overhaul of its judiciary, and the European Commission, the
EU’s executive arm, will be strict in monitoring these cases,
HVG said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
