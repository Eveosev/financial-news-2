Egypt ’s state-owned natural gas
company is canceling a contract to supply fuel to  Israel , the
Haaretz newspaper reported.  The Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Co. told the exporter that
supplies Israel with natural gas, EMG, that an agreement reached
in 2005 will be canceled, the newspaper reported, without saying
where it obtained the information.  The 2005 agreement was part of a political accord between
the two countries under which Egypt agreed to supply 7 billion
cubic meters of gas to the Israeli market for 20 years, with an
option to double the supply, the newspaper reported.  The article didn’t cite the reason for the change.  To contact the reporters on this story:
