The U.K. trimmed 1.5 billion pounds
($2.4 billion) from its infrastructure budget as it seeks to
streamline the way it carries out the construction of roads,
rail and public buildings, the Treasury said.  The government said it shaved 600 million pounds from the
3.2 billion-pound construction bill on 20 road projects as part
of a three-year plan to reduce overall infrastructure costs by
as much as 3 billion pounds. It said it cut 400 million pounds
from London Underground building costs.  “Every pound saved through this review program is a pound
more that can be spent on new infrastructure for the U.K.,”
Treasury Minister Lord James Sassoon said in a statement.  Infrastructure building has risen to about 20 billion
pounds a year, and Prime Minister  David Cameron , seeking ways to
stimulate Britain’s economy without using public money, said
last month that private investment in roads must be accelerated.  Cameron said he’ll ask the Treasury and the Department for
Transport to explore ways of attracting “large-scale private
investment” from sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and
other private investors. He called for “new ownership and
financing” plans to be in place by the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
