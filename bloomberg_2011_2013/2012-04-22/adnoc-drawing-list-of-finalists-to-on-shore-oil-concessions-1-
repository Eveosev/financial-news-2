Abu Dhabi  National Oil Co. is still
preparing the final list of bidders to compete for on-shore oil
concessions due to be awarded by 2014, Director General Abdulla Nasser Al Suwaidi said.  “We are now in the selection process of the bidders and we
have not come up with the final list of bidders,” al Suwaidi
told reporters today in Abu Dhabi. Current partners and new
companies will be considered, he said.  Adnoc, as the state producer in the capital of the United
Arab Emirates is known, is currently setting up the tendering
process to accept bids for the oil fields, he said.  Adnoc owns 60 percent of  Abu Dhabi Co. for Onshore Oil
Operations , or ADCO, with  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , Royal Dutch  Shell (RDSA) 
Plc, BP Plc,  Total SA (FP)  and Partex Oil & Gas holding the rest.
Exxon Mobil, Shell and BP produce oil at onshore fields in Abu
Dhabi under a concession agreement that dates back to 1939. The
fields began commercial production in 1960 and Abu Dhabi’s
state-run oil company joined as a partner in the 1970s, forming
ADCO, which holds the concession for six main onshore fields
until 2014.  Exxon Mobil, the world’s biggest company by market value,
expects Abu Dhabi to change the terms for the Persian Gulf
emirate’s main oil producing concession when the current
agreement expires in 2014, Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson
said Dec. 6.  Abu Dhabi holds more than 90 percent of crude in the
U.A.E.,  one of the few Middle East states that allow foreign
companies to explore for and produce oil within its borders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
