Egypt ’s military ruler said the
armed forces is working toward handing over power to a civilian
government as scheduled and is not backing any candidate in the
May 23 presidential election, Al-Ahram said.  Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi also said that though
the military is capable of responding to insults “with an iron
fist” it wouldn’t do so to help ensure safety and stability,
the state-run newspaper reported.  Tens of thousands of Egyptians demonstrated in Cairo on
April 20, calling on the military to abide by the timeline for
handing over power to an elected government by June 30. The
military council that took over after President  Hosni Mubarak ’s
ouster last year repeatedly has denied that it intends to hold
onto power or is considering delaying the presidential
elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
