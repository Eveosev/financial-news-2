Bundesbank board member Joachim Nagel rejected proposals to allow European banks in crisis to
get direct help from the European Unionâ€™s rescue funds,
 Handelsblatt  newspaper reported in a preview of an article that
will be published tomorrow, citing an interview with Nagel.  Spain  is responsible for Spanish banks in need of aid and
for recapitalizing, restructuring or closing them, Nagel said,
according to Handelsblatt. Nagel says he rules out direct
financial aid from the European Financial Stability Facility as
that would pass on the risks of a bank bailout to all European
taxpayers, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
