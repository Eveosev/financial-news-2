NM Rothschild & Sons Ltd.’s head
for the  Middle East , Herve Sawko, is moving to the investment
bank’s Paris office and will be replaced by Christopher Hawley,
a person familiar with the plan said.  Sawko, 45, moved to Dubai from New York in 2009 as managing
director and head of  investment banking . Hawley, based in Dubai,
will combine the new position with his existing role as head of
mergers and acquisitions, the person said, declining to be
identified because the information is private.  A spokesman for London-based Rothschild in Dubai declined
to comment. Dow Jones reported the story on April 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
