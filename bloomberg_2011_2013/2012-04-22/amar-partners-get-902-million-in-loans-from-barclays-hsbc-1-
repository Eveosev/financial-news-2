Partners in the the offshore Tamar
gas field signed agreements with a consortium of 11 banks led by
 Barclays Plc (BARC)  and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  for a total of $902 million
in loans to develop the site.  Avner Oil Exploration LLP (AVNRL)  and  Delek Drilling LP (DEDRL)  each signed
separate deals for a limited-recourse loan of $400 million for
up to eight years, the companies reported in a statement to the
Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.  Dor Alon Energy (DRAL)  in Israel (1988) will
receive a $102 million loan under the same terms.  The partners developing the Tamar field are boosting their
financing needs as they are due to start production next year of
a field large enough to supply the country with gas for two
decades. The larger Leviathan field is estimated to hold as much
as 20 trillion cubic feet of gas, more than the U.K.â€™s remaining
reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
