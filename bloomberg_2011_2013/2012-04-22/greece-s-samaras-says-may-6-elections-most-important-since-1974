Antonis Samaras, the head of
 Greece ’s New Democracy party which is leading in opinion polls,
said elections on May 6 were the “most critical” since the
return of democracy in 1974.  “Our goal is to change everything,” Samaras said in a
speech in Athens today, televised live on state-run NET TV.
“The growth model, the way of government. Not just one or the
other: both.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
