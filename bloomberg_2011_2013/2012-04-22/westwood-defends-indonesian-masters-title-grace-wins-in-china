Lee Westwood  held off a late
challenge by Thailand’s Thaworn Wiratchant to defend his
Indonesian Open title today, even after carding a 2-over-par
final round.  The Englishman, No. 3 in the world rankings, finished on
16-under 272 at the Royale Jakarta Golf Club, two shots ahead of
Wiratchant, with India’s Gaganjeet Bhullar and Shiv Kapur on 12-
under.  “Hopefully this will kick-start my year,” Westwood was
cited as saying by the European Tour’s website. “I’ve played
well without any wins so hopefully I can go on and win other
tournaments.”  Westwood, who is 39 in two days, had three bogeys in his
final eight holes but held on for his 38th career victory.  In Tianjin, Branden Grace claimed his third European Tour
title of the season with a three-shot victory at the Volvo China
Open.  The 23-year-old finished ahead of  Belgium ’s Nicolas
Colsaerts, with England’s Richard Finch another shot back. Grace
had only come through the Tour qualifying school in the winter.  “To have three before May is literally unbelievable, but
I’ve been playing well so I’ve been feeling like I can win and
I’ve been giving myself opportunities,” Grace told the European
Tour’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
