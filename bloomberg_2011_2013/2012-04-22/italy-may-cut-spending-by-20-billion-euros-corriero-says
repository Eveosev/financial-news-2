The Italian government aims to cut
state spending by 20 billion euros ($26.4 billion) to 25 billion
euros, the newspaper  Corriere della Sera  reported, without
saying how it got the information.  The spending review, which will be presented in a few days,
has a “fundamental role” in Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s plan
to reduce debt, Corriere reported.  Measures being considered include slashing rent costs by
relocating to vacant public buildings and bringing together
agencies, Corriere said. The plan may also increase the role of
Consip, the government agency that runs public tenders, to
centralize purchases, and a review of the tech platforms of
ministries and local administrations, the daily said.  Some ministers including the Interior and Defense are
opposing possible cuts to their departments, Corriere said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
