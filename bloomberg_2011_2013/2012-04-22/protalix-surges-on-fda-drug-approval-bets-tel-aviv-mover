Protalix BioTherapeutics Inc. (PLX) 
surged the most on record on bets U.S. regulators will approve
its debut drug treatment for use next month.  Protalix, a Carmiel, Israel-based biopharmaceutical
company,  soared  the most since the shares were listed in Tel
Aviv in September 2010, advancing 16 percent to 28 shekels at
the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv. Protalix shares have jumped 48
percent in Tel Aviv since the start of the year, compared with a
7 percent gain for the TA-25 Index. The benchmark index advanced
0.8 percent today.  Protalix has developed with  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  a protein known as
taliglucerase alfa using plant cells to replace an enzyme
missing in people with Gaucher disease, a genetic ailment that
affects as many as one in 50,000 people in the U.S., according
to the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The
treatment is up for review by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration on May 1, according to Bloomberg Industries.  “Investors are speculating that the FDA might approve
their drug,” Adi Babani, a trader at Clal Finance Batucha
Brokerage Ltd. in  Tel Aviv  said by phone today.  Protalix dropped 18 percent on Dec. 6 after the FDA delayed
a decision on the treatment.  Gaucher disease, which can cause fat to build up in the
liver, spleen, bone marrow and nervous system, affects about 1
in every 50,000 to 100,000 people, according to the National
Human Genome Research Institute. About 1 in 14 individuals of
Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry is a carrier of the disease and as
many as 1 in 500 present a form of the disorder.  Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, paid $60 million for
rights to sell taliglucerase and agreed to pay Protalix an
additional $55 million if the drug passed certain regulatory
hurdles, according to a Dec. 1, 2009 statement. New York-based
Pfizer is entitled to 60 percent of the drug’s revenue under the
agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
