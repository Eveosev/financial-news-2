Olam International Ltd. (OLAM) , a
Singapore-based commodity supplier, will buy 49 percent of
Zimbabwe’s biggest cotton company,  Aico Africa Ltd. (AICO) , for $50
million, the  Sunday Mail  reported, citing unidentified

units separately for $8 million in an effort to cut debt, the
Sunday Mail said. Harare-listed Aico, Africa’s biggest cotton
ginner, has a market value of about $100 million, the paper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
