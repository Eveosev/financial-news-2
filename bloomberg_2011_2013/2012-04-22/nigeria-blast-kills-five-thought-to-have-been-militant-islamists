Five people believed to have been
members of the Nigerian Boko Haram Islamic militant sect were
killed yesterday in an accidental explosion at their bomb-making
facility in the northeastern town of Biu, 190 kilometers (118
miles) south of Maiduguri city, a military spokesman said.  Troops deployed to Biu found body parts thought to have
been of five individuals killed in an explosion of improvised
explosive devices, Colonel Victor Ebhaleme, field operations
officer of the joint military  task force  in charge of security
in the region, said by telephone today from Maiduguri.  Two people were arrested trying to flee the factory,
Ebhaleme said.  Authorities in  Nigeria ,  Africa â€™s top oil producer, blame
Boko Haram for a surge of attacks since 2009 against government
buildings and security forces in the mainly Muslim north and
Abuja, the capital. The group claimed responsibility for
multiple blasts and attacks in the city of Kano on Jan. 20 that
killed at least 256 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
