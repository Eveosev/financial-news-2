Lackluster demand at a  Christie’s
International (BID)  wine auction raised HK$32.7 million ($4.2 million)
in  Hong Kong  Saturday, with only 74 percent of lots sold as
buyers became more selective about vintages.  “A flight to quality is a good assessment,” Charles
Curtis, head of wine for Christie’s  Asia , said after the sale.
“There was an oversupply of young vintages and we were starved
for older vintages.”  During the one-day sale, which lasted nearly seven hours,
demand was anemic for all but the best vintages of first growth
Bordeaux wines, dealers said.  A large number of lots of younger vintages of Chateau
Lafite and other first growths went unsold, while less desirable
older growths only fetched  prices  near their low estimates.  That’s a sea change from a year ago when any bottle of
Lafite or  Chateau Margaux  sold for prices well in excess of the
higher estimates, in auctions routinely 100 percent sold out.  The Liv-Ex 50 Fine Wine Index, which tracks Bordeaux first
growths, has fallen 23 percent since June.  The bright spot of the auction came during lively bidding
on a sale of three verticals of Romanee-Conti Domaine de la
Romanee Conti, the top Burgundy that consistently commands the
highest prices at auction.  A single telephone bidder bought each of the three six-
bottle lots spanning the years 1990-1995, 1996-2001 and
2002-2007, for a combined HK$2.18 million ($280,000), or
HK$121,000 per bottle.  The most paid for a single lot on the day was for a 56-
bottle vertical of La Tache Domaine de la  Romanee Conti  spanning
the years 1951 to 2008 (excluding 1968) which sold for HK$1
million, or HK$17,860 per bottle, compared with a presale low
estimate of HK$1.2 million.  (Frederik Balfour is a reporter at large for Muse, the arts
