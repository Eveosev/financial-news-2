Russia will need foreign investment
from companies including  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  to maintain its
position as an oil superpower, the Wall Street Journal reported,
citing an interview with Deputy Prime Minister  Igor Sechin .  As much as 40 percent of Russia’s oil output will come from
Arctic waters and the Black Sea by 2030, Sechin said in an
interview given on April 18 and reported on the Journal’s
website yesterday. Russia isn’t extracting oil from those
sources and will need foreign investment to do so, the Journal
cited Sechin as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
