The U.K. opposition  Labour Party  is
pushing the government to change rules covering fund managers so
they have to disclose how they voted on issues including
executive pay.  The party’s Business spokesman Chuka Umunna has tabled an
amendment to the Financial Services Bill, currently going
through Parliament, to bring into force powers from the 2006
Companies Act allowing the government to force such disclosures.  Umunna argues such openness would be a way of encouraging
corporate pay restraint. Business Secretary  Vince Cable , a
Liberal Democrat, has also said pay and bonuses have been out of
control in recent years.  “Labour is laying down the gauntlet to Vince Cable and
this Conservative-led government to show that they are serious
about increasing accountability and transparency in corporate
Britain,” Umunna said in an e-mailed statement. “Making fund
managers disclose how they vote on issues will mean the
pensioner or the ordinary investor will be in a better position
to access information on how votes are cast in their name on
matters such as executive pay.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
