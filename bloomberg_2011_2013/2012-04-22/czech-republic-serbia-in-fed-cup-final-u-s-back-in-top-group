The  Czech Republic  and Serbia will
contest the Fed Cup tennis final after completing victories
today, while the U.S. will return to the elite World Group after
a win against Ukraine.  The Czechs, last year’s champions, sealed their spot with a
win in the day’s opening singles match between Petra Kvitova and
 Italy ’s Francesca Schiavone after victories in both matches on
day one.  Serbia will contest the final in women’s tennis’s top team
competition for a first time after a second singles win for
Jelena Jankovic ended Russia’s hopes.  The final is scheduled for Nov. 3 and 4.  Serena Williams extended her perfect Fed Cup match record
to 11-0 with a 6-3, 6-2 win against Lesia Tsurenko to give the
U.S. an unbeatable lead in its playoff tie, before her teammates
completed a whitewash.  The U.S., winner of the Fed Cup a record 17 times, had been
relegated for a first time a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
