Brisbane Roar rallied to beat Perth
Glory 2-1 with a stoppage-time penalty to become the first team
to win back-to-back Australian A-League soccer championships.  Besart Berisha tied the game with a header on 84 minutes,
then scored from the spot after referee Jarred Gillett ruled he
had been tripped in the penalty area.  “It looked to me that it was an air swing, he loses his
balance and goes down,” Perth coach Ian Ferguson, a former
Scotland midfielder, told Fox Sports. “It absolutely killed us,
there was no way back.”  The Glory had led last night at Brisbane’s Suncorp Stadium
on an own goal by Ivan Franjic after 52 minutes.  Brisbane becomes the first team to successfully defend its
title since the A-League replaced  Australia ’s National Soccer
League in 2005. The Roar joins Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC
as two-time champions.  “This team never gives up,” Brisbane captain  Matt Smith 
said at the presentation ceremony.  The Glory, owned by  Cape Lambert Resources Ltd. (CFE)  Executive
Chairman Tony Sage, had advanced to their first A-League final
by beating the Central Coast Mariners, who topped the regular-
season standings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
