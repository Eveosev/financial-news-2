Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  said the greatest threat to world peace is “the
marriage of a militant Islamist regime with nuclear weapons,”
including  Iran  developing the bomb or the Taliban seizing power
in Pakistan,  Welt am Sonntag  reported.  The world would “change harshly” if Iran developed
nuclear weapons, with “terrorism on a much greater scale than
before,” Netanyahu said, according to the German newspaper.  Terrorists would believe that their “backward and
apocalyptic creed” had a chance of materializing and Iran would
have the ability to attack Israel, which is “their propensity
to do,” Welt cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
