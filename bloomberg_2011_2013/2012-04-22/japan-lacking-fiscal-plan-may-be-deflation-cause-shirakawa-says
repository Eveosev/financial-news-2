Japan’s absence of “concrete
reform plans” for the nation’s finances may be contributing to
deflation and sluggish economic growth by discouraging spending
by the public, central bank Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said.  Consumers may be limiting spending “on concerns over
future fiscal developments,” Shirakawa said in  remarks  prepared
for an event in  Washington  yesterday. This may be “one factor
behind sluggish economic growth and mild deflation,” he said.  The  Bank of Japan  is under pressure from lawmakers to step
up its attack on more than decade-long deflation as the
government seeks to sustain a recovery from last year’s
earthquake and economic contraction. Shirakawa has pledged to
extend “powerful” easing until a 1 percent price goal is in
sight and his policy board next meets on April 27.  The nation’s borrowings will exceed 1,000 trillion yen
($12.4 trillion) for the first time in this fiscal year, the
Finance Ministry projects, while the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development predicts  Japan ’s public debt will
reach 219 percent of gross domestic product.  Shirakawa said yesterday that stability in Japanese
government bond yields shows investors’ expectations that
“fiscal soundness will be restored through structural reforms
in both the economic and fiscal areas.”  “At the moment, such expectations are not firmly backed by
concrete reform plans,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
