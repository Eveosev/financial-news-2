Egypt ’s only independent English-
language daily newspaper printed in the country has closed after
seven years, its editorial staff said.  “Last Thursday, the editorial staff of Daily News Egypt
was informed, quite abruptly, that our last issue was going to
be the one which was published Saturday-Sunday, April 21-22,
2012,” the staff said in an editorial posted on the newspaper’s
online edition today.  The editorial did not explain the circumstances leading to
the closure. Ahmed Badrawi, one of the investors in the
publication, declined to comment when contacted on his mobile
phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
