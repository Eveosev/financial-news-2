Egypt  called on the governments of
Sudan and  South Sudan  to end hostilities and return to the
negotiating table after more than a week of fighting over a
disputed oil-rich region in the south of the country, the state-
run Middle East News Agency said.  Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr said the northern
government in Khartoum and its southern counterpart in Juba must
abide by a 1956 demarcation line and agree to halt hostilities,
the Cairo-based agency reported, citing a statement by ministry
spokesman Amr Rushi. He said the foreign minister spoke with his
counterparts in both governments today.  South Sudan seceded from the north last July, taking with
it control of about 75 percent of the country’s 400,000 barrels
per day in oil production. The two sides have been fighting for
more than a week over Heglig, an oil-rich region whose oil
fields were administered by  Sudan  after the south’s secession.
Both sides lay claim to the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
