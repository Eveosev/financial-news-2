Bright Food Group Co., which is
backed by the Chinese government, is considering buying Weetabix
from  Lion Capital LLP , the Sunday Times said, without saying
where it got the information.  Bright Food values the British cereal maker at about 1
billion pounds ($1.6 billion) and has been holding talks about
buying the company from the U.K. private-equity firm for several
weeks, the Times said.  Lion Capital was not immediately available to comment
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
