Credit Libanais SAL, a Lebanese
lender 65 percent owned by  EFG-Hermes Holding SAE (HRHO) , dismissed a
report that the biggest publicly traded Arab investment bank may
sell the stake,  Al-Akhbar reported  yesterday.  The appointment of EFG-Hermes co-chief executive officers
Hassan Heikal and Yasser al Mallawany to the board of Credit
Libanais indicates EFG-Hermes’s intention to retain the stake,
Al-Akhbar said, citing the information office of the Lebanese
bank’s chairman.  EFG-Hermes acquired the stake in the Lebanese commercial
bank in 2010.  Calls to EFG-Hermes’s investor relations office were not
answered today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
