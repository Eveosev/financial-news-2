Ben Curtis  won the Texas Open by
two strokes over Matt Every and John Huh for his fourth title on
golf’s U.S.  PGA Tour  and first since 2006.  Curtis shot an even-par 72 during yesterday’s final round
at the TPC  San Antonio  to finish the tournament at 9-under par
279. Every and Huh tied for second place at 7 under.  Prior to the Texas Open, Curtis was 285th in the  Official
World Golf Ranking  and missed the cut for weekend play in two of
his three tour events this year and in 13 of 23 in 2011.  “The last couple years I felt like I was so close to
playing so many good tournaments and just ended up missing the
cut by one or having a bad round here or there,” Curtis, who
collected $1.12 million, said at a news conference. “Finally
this week, every part of the game together.”  Curtis got his maiden win at the 2003 British Open as a
rookie ranked 396th in the world after  Thomas Bjorn  surrendered
a three-shot lead with four holes to play. His other victories
before yesterday came at the Booz Allen Classic and 84 Lumber
Classic, both in 2006.  Curtis’s worst year on tour since winning the British Open
was 2011, when he collected $423,466 in prize money. Between
2003 and last year he had $10.2 million in on-course earnings at
an average of $1.13 million a year.  Curtis, who was second at the 2008 U.S.  PGA Championship ,
holed a putt of almost 23 feet (7 meters) for par at the 17th
hole to retain his one-shot lead. He then sealed the victory
with a birdie on the par-5 18th, becoming the first golfer since
 Jim Furyk  at the 2010 Tour Championship to win on the PGA Tour
without breaking par during the final two rounds.  “I love hard golf courses. I love it when par is
premium,” said Curtis, who shot 73 and 72 the final two days to
follow consecutive rounds of 67. “I just love courses that set-
up that way where you got to control your distance not only in
the air but also on the ground.”  Every, who began the Texas Open with a course-record 9-
under-par 63, had a 71 yesterday, while Huh, a rookie, shot a
69.  Kelly Kraft , the U.S. Amateur champion, missed the halfway
cut in his first start as a professional.  The tour now moves east for the Zurich Classic of  New
Orleans  at the TPC Louisiana in Avondale from April 26-29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
