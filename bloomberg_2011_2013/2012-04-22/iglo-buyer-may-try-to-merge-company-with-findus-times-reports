Private-equity firms considering a
purchase of Iglo Foods Group Ltd. may try to combine the company
with Findus Foods, the Sunday Times reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Permira Advisers LLP is trying to sell Iglo Foods, which it
bought in 2006, the newspaper said. Findus is struggling to pay
its debts, which has made it a target of private-equity firms,
the Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
