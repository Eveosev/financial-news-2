Douglas Flint, the chairman of HSBC
Holdings Plc, said the  Bank of England ’s new Financial Policy
Committee is likely to increase borrowing costs for companies,
the Sunday Telegraph reported, citing a speech.  The committee, which has proposed to have powers over the
amount of capital that lenders should hold, would reduce
companies’ access to credit and increase its cost, Flint said in
a speech to corporate treasurers in Liverpool, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
