Bankia SA (BKIA)  Chief Executive Officer
Francisco Verdu said the bad loans ratio will continue to grow
until it peaks later this year,  ABC  reported today in an
interview.  Bankia will post a profit in the first quarter and plans to
continue selling non-core assets, Verdu also said in the
interview, ABC reported. The bank is analyzing opportunities to
merge with other lenders as part of the financial industryâ€™s
restructuring process, the executive also told ABC.  Bankia, formed from the merger of seven Spanish savings
banks, will be able to generate enough income to pay back funds
provided by the state rescue fund FROB, Verdu said, according to
the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
