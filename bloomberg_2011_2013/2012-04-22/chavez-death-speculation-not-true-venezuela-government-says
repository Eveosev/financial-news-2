Venezuela’s government denied
speculation of President  Hugo Chavez ’s death as the leader’s
nine-day absence from television screens fueled talk that his
poor health may prevent him from running in October’s election.  Information Minister Andres Izarra, writing on  Twitter ,
said opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski was the
“political fatality” and that the speculation had been
“denied.”  “These bitter people don’t learn, they’ve been saying for
days that the commander died, while the only one without life
is” Capriles,  Diosdado Cabello , head of the National Assembly,
wrote on his  Twitter  account.  Chavez missed the Summit of the Americas in  Colombia  and
Venezuela’s Constitution Day celebrations in the past week after
flying to Cuba for cancer treatments. His absence from
television is the longest since at least November.  Chavez hasn’t spoken publicly since a speech April 13 in
Caracas. Instead, he has sent  messages  from his Twitter account.
The 57-year-old leader has undergone three operations in Cuba
since June.  Capriles used his Twitter  account  to question Chavez’s
absence, writing today, “The country and the problems of
Venezuelans can’t be resolved over Twitter!”  Chavez will return to the South American country next week
after completing radiation therapy in Cuba, Cabello said April
20 on state television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
