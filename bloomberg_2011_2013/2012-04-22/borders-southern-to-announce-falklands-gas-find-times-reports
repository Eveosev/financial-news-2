Borders & Southern Petroleum Plc (BOR) , a
U.K. energy explorer operating in the Falkland Islands, may
announce a gas find within days, the Sunday Times said, citing
an unidentified person close to the company.  The gas discovery was made at a well about 100 miles
southeast of the Falklands that Borders & Southern began
drilling in January, the newspaper reported. Borders & Southern
declined to comment on whether it found gas reserves, the Sunday
Times said.  Borders & Southern shares jumped 55 percent on April 18
amid speculation the company had made a discovery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
