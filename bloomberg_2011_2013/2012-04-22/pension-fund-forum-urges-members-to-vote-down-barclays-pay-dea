The Local Authority Pension Fund
Forum recommended members vote against  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s annual
report and accounts saying the rules the lender follows may have
allowed it to overstate earnings.  “Overstated profits have been used to calculate and
justify executive bonuses and long-term remuneration schemes,”
the forum said in an e-mailed statement, urging its members to
oppose the report at the annual general meeting on April 25.  The group, whose members oversee about 115 billion pounds
($177 billion), has been criticizing the IAS 39 International
Financial Reporting Standards rule for at least two years.  The group has said the rule prevents banks from using their
own data to anticipate future losses from loans before they
occur, stopping lenders from booking potentially bad loans and
allowing them to justify higher compensation.  Phillippa-Jane Vermoter, a spokeswoman for London-based
Barclays, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
