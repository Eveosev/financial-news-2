Chile President Sebastian Pinera
plans to propose  tax reform  this week that includes a one-time
credit to offset rising fuel costs and a reduction in taxes on
loans, El Mercurio newspaper reported.  The plan would increase an income tax on businesses to 20
percent from 18.5 percent, raising an additional $700 million,
the newspaper said, citing unidentified presidential officials.
The stamp duty, or loan tax, would fall from its current rate of
0.6 percent and be cut at least in half, El Mercurio said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
