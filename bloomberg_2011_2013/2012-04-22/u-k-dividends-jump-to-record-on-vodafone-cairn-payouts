U.K. dividends increased to a
record 18.8 billion pounds ($30 billion) last quarter after one-
time payments from Vodafone Group Plc and Cairn Energy Plc.  Payouts climbed by 25 percent from a year ago, reaching the
highest ever level for a first quarter, Capita Registrars said
in a report today, citing figures from Exchange Data
International. Excluding the special dividends, growth was 6.6
percent, compared with a 13 percent gain for the whole of 2011.  Vodafone and Cairn Energy each paid out 2.2 billion pounds
in extraordinary dividends as another 157 U.K. companies also
disbursed cash in the first quarter, according to the report. In
the same period, the nation’s benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  advanced
3.5 percent as the  European Central Bank  channeled 1 trillion
euros ($1.3 trillion) to the region’s lenders to spur lending
and help solve the sovereign-debt crisis.  “Early evidence suggests the economy was in better shape
through the first quarter,” Charles Cryer, chief executive
officer of Capita Registrars, said in a statement. “As the
euro-zone crisis abates, this may give companies greater
confidence to return cash as the year goes by.”  Capita increased its full-year dividend forecast by 1.3
billion pounds to a record 76.3 billion pounds. That would be an
increase of 12 percent on 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
