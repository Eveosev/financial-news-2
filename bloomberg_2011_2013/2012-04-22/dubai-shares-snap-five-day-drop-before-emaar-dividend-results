Dubai’s benchmark stock index rose
for the first time in six days on bets  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR)  may
agree to boost its 2011 dividend tomorrow and before the real-
estate company reports earnings. Egypt’s shares surged.  Emaar, developer of the world’s tallest building and
expected to post a 37 percent gain in quarterly profit, advanced
the most in almost three weeks.  Aramex PJSC (ARMX) , the Middle East’s
largest logistics company, rallied 2.3 percent. The  DFM General
Index (DFMGI)  climbed 0.7 percent, the first gain since April 12, to
1,650.20 at the 2 p.m. close in the emirate. The  Bloomberg GCC
200 (BGCC200)  Index fell 0.1 percent, while in North Africa the  EGX30
Index (EGX30)  rallied 2.6 percent.  Emaar, the company with the  heaviest weighting  on Dubai’s
index, is scheduled to meet with shareholders at 4 p.m. tomorrow
to discuss its proposal to pay a cash dividend of  10 fils  for
2011, unchanged from 2010. Last year, Emaar abandoned a plan not
to pay a dividend after a three-hour meeting between
shareholders and executives.  Investors “are hoping they will influence the board to
boost the dividend to 15 fils rather than the 10 fils
recommended last month,” said Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu
Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities. The outlook for the company’s
earnings is positive, Farhat said.  Profit Growth  Emaar,  owned 31 percent  by Dubai’s government, didn’t
distribute dividends for 2009 and 2008, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Its profit plunged 89 percent and 54
percent those years, respectively, as the company that derives
more than three-quarters of revenue domestically suffered when
Dubai’s real-estate crash dragged home prices down 65 percent
from a mid-2008 peak.  The developer may report on April 24 an increase in first-
quarter profit to 577 million dirhams ($157 million), according
to the  median estimate  of four analysts on Bloomberg. The shares
rose 3.1 percent, the biggest advance since April 3, to 3.30
dirhams. Aramex gained the most since Feb. 19 to 1.8 dirhams.  Shares in the Persian Gulf also rose after oil for May
delivery increased 0.8 percent to $103.05 on the New York
Mercantile Exchange on April 20. Gulf Arab oil exporters,
including  Saudi Arabia  and the U.A.E., supply about a fifth of
the world’s oil. The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  advanced 1.7 percent
last week after the International Monetary Fund raised its
forecasts for global economic growth and U.S. corporate earnings
beat estimates.  Egypt Aid  In Egypt, the EGX30 Index advanced the most since Feb. 19
to 4,829.12. The market regulator after the close approved the
tender offer of a unit of  France Telecom SA (FTE)  for shares of
Egyptian Co. for Mobile Services, also known as Mobinil.  Separately, Saudi Arabia will provide the nation with an
aid package that may include a three-year deposit or the
purchase of treasury bills and bonds, Egyptian Prime Minister
Kamal el-Ganzouri said April 19. Egypt will sign an agreement
with the IMF for a $3.2 billion loan by May 15, after securing
approval from the Islamists who control parliament, the Finance
Ministry said on April 12.  “The  Saudi Arabia (SABIC)  aid package and reports of progress
regarding the IMF loan” have pushed stocks higher, said Wafik Dawood, director of institutional sales at Cairo-based Mega
Investments Securities. “Speculation the regulator will make a
statement regarding the France Telecom and Mobinil deal,” was
also a catalyst, he said.  Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  gained 0.7 percent and  Kuwait’s Stock
Exchange Price Index (KWSEIDX)  added 0.6 percent. Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General
Index (ADSMI)  and Bahrain’s  BB All Share Index (BHSEASI)  slipped 0.2 percent,
Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  fell 0.5 percent after
yesterday surging 1.4 percent. Oman’s measure retreated 0.6
percent.  In Israel, the  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  advanced 0.8 percent in Tel
Aviv. The yield on the country’s 5.5 percent notes due January
2022 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.67
percent.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
