ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  Chief Executive Officer
 Joe Hogan  said  Germany ’s energy transition may fail if the
country doesn’t expand its electricity grid faster,  Handelsblatt 
reported in a preview of a story that will run tomorrow.  The dimension of the integration of wind and solar power
parks is unparalleled in the world and it is not yet clear to
all participants how important the  power grid  is for the success
of the transition, Hogan said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
