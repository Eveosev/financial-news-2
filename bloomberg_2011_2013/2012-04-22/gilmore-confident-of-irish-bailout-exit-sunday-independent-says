Irish Deputy Prime Minister  Eamon Gilmore  said he is “confident” the country will exit its
international bailout within two years, the  Sunday Independent 
reported, citing an interview.  Progress in talks with European officials and the
International Monetary Fund on easing Ireland’s banking rescue
costs is slow and he’d “like to see things move a lot faster”,
the newspaper cited Gilmore as saying.  Ireland’s bailout program is scheduled to conclude at the
end of 2013.  To contact the reporters on this story:
