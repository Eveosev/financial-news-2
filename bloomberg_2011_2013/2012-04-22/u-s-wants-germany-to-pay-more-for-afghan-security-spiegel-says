The U.S. wants  Germany  to pay more
than currently planned to finance domestic security forces in
 Afghanistan  once international forces pull back in 2014,  Spiegel 
magazine reported, citing internal German Foreign Office
documents.  The U.S. government wants Germany to contribute 190 million
euros ($251 million) of the 3.1 billion euros needed each year
from 2015 to 2025, the German magazine said.  The European nation estimates it will pay 100 million euros
to 150 million euros a year, though that amount is subject to
adjustment, Spiegel said, citing the documents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
