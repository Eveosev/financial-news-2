Syria ’s main opposition group
called on the  United Nations  to approve an even bigger
contingent of unarmed observers, and said it was ready to help
the monitors in their mission, the state-run Middle East News
Agency reported today.  The Syrian National Council welcomed the UN Security
Council’s decision yesterday to send in 300 unarmed observers to
monitor a cease-fire between President Bashar al-Assad’s forces
and rebel groups seeking his ouster, though the number should be
increased to 3,000, Basma Kidmani, a spokeswoman for the group,
was quoted as saying by MENA after an SNC delegation met with
Arab League Secretary-General Nabil El-Arabi.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story: Tarek El-Tablawy in Cairo
