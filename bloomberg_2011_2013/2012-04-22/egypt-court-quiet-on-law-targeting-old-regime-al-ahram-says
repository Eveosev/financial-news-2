Egypt ’s  Constitutional Court  has
declined to issue an opinion on a draft law that would bar
former top officials in Hosni Mubarak’s ousted regime from
running for the presidency, Al-Ahram reported.  The high court said it couldn’t rule on the draft, which
was approved by parliament, until it becomes law, the state-run
newspaper reported. The legislation must be approved by the
ruling military council before it takes effect.  The draft law would prevent individuals who held top spots
in the former regime from holding the presidency, the vice
presidency, the premiership and other senior positions for a
period of 10 years from the day Mubarak was pushed from power in
February 2011.  Lawmakers drafted the measure partly in response to a now-
failed presidential bid by Mubarak’s longtime intelligence
chief,  Omar Suleiman , who also briefly served as vice president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
