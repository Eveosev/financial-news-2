Kenmare Resources Plc (KMR)  Managing
Director Michael Carvill said he hopes the Dublin-based mining
company isn’t acquired by another party, the Sunday Times
reported, citing an interview.  Carvill said that while he hasn’t received an offer, he
hopes that an acquisition “doesn’t happen” as the purchasing
company’s shareholders would be the beneficiaries of Kenmare’s
latent potential, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
