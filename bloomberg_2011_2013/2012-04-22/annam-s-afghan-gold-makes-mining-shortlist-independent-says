Afghan Gold, a company founded by
former  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  deal maker Ian Hannam, has been
shortlisted by  Afghanistan  for mining licences, the  Independent
on Sunday  reported, without saying where it got the information.  Afghan Gold and its joint venture with Eti Gemus have both
qualified to bid for licences to mine in four areas rich in
copper and gold, according to the report.  Hannam resigned this month after the U.K. Financial
Services Authority fined him 450,000 pounds ($725,000) for
disclosing inside information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
