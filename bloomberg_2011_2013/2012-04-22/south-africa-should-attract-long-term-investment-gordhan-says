South  Africa  should attract long-
term investment into the country and the continent and build on
its reputation as the launching pad for investment in Africa,
Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said.  “There is a profound structural shift in the global
economy in which the emerging markets will play a key role,” he
said in an opinion piece published in  Sunday Times  today.
“Africa and South Africa can, and must, ride this new wave of
growth.”  The continent will prove to offer higher returns for
investors seeking new opportunities, he said. Real rates of
returns averaged about 22 percent from 2005 to 2008, the same
range as China’s, Pravin said, citing the  World Bank .  Growth, investment and development are critical to help
 South Africa  transform aspirations on the ground, he said. The
country must continue to improve the quality of its social
spending, which has increased from 49 percent of government
expenditure 10 years ago to 58 percent, he said.  “The challenge now is not so much the increase in the rand
value of social expenditure, but the increase in the quality of
public services, especially education and health,” he said.
“More importantly, our task is to shift people out of the
welfare net and into jobs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
