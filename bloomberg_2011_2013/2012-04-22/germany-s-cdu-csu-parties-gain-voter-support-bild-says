Escada GmbH, the Munich-based maker
of luxury clothing for women, plans to introduce a line for men
once its restructuring has been completed, Welt am Sonntag
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Bruno Saelzer.  The company’s sales and profit in the first months of this
year have been higher than in the same period in 2011, Saelzer
said, according to the newspaper. Escada, which reported a 7
percent rise in revenue to 300 million euros ($396 million) last
year, forecasts annual sales of more than 500 million euros in
“the medium-term,”  Welt am Sonntag  cited Saelzer as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
