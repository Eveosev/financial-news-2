DRB-Hicom Bhd. (DRB)  has discussed
selling Lotus Group International to either  Geely Automobile
Holdings Ltd. (175)  or  China  Youngman Automobile Group Co., the Sunday
Times reported, without saying where it got the information.  Geely and Youngman are both based in China, with Youngman
already acting as the importer of British-made Lotus cars into
the country, the Times reported. Genii Capital, a private-equity
firm in Luxembourg, has also reviewed an acquisition of Lotus,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
