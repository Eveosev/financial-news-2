Israel ’s short-term government
bonds dropped, pushing yields to the highest in more than two
weeks, on investor bets borrowing costs will remain unchanged in
coming months on renewed concern about the global economy.  The yield on the 4.25 percent notes due January 2015 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.02 percent,
matching the level on April 5, at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel
Aviv. Shorter-maturity notes are typically more sensitive to
interest rate changes. One-year  interest-rate swaps , an
indicator of investor expectations for rates over the period,
were unchanged at 2.57 percent on April 20. The swaps gained 17
basis points this year.  The Bank of Israel’s policy committee, led by Governor
 Stanley Fischer , will hold the  benchmark rate  at 2.5 percent for
a third month tomorrow, according to all 23 economists in a
 Bloomberg survey . Spanish notes fell last week, extending the
longest run of weekly declines since January 2007, as the Group
of 20 nations said  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis poses a threat
to global growth. About 40 percent of Israel’s gross domestic
product is made up of exports, with Europe and the U.S. the
largest markets.  “ Interest rates  are likely to remain at the current level
for a prolonged period which is pushing yields higher,” said
 Rafael Gozlan , chief economist at I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage &
Investments Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “Higher inflation expectations
may call for a rate increase. However, renewed concern about the
global economic recovery which is likely to have an impact on
local exports and growth may postpone that decision.”  Annual Inflation  The two-year break-even rate, the yield difference between
inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government bonds of
similar maturity, declined three basis points to 296. That
implies an average annual inflation rate of 2.96 percent.
Inflation is expected to reach 2.5 percent in the next 12
months, according to a survey of economists released by the  Bank
of Israel  last week. The government’s target range for inflation
is 1 percent to 3 percent.  The yield on the 5.5 percent benchmark notes due January
2022 rose one basis point to 4.67 percent, the highest since
April 5. The Finance Ministry plans to sell a combined 1.4
billion shekels ($373 million) of bonds at an auction tomorrow,
including 250 million shekels each of the benchmark notes and
the 3.5 percent bonds due August 2014, according to ministry
data posted on Bloomberg. The government will also offer 250
million shekels of inflation-linked bonds due May 2017.  The Tel-Bond 40 Index of corporate bonds gained 0.2 percent
to 268.09. The shekel strengthened 0.2 percent to 3.7502 a
dollar on April 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
