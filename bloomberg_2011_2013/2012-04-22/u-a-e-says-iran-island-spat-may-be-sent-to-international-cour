The Cabinet of the  United Arab
Emirates  called for resolving a dispute with Iran over three
islands in the Persian Gulf through negotiations or by taking
the matter to the  International Court of Justice .  The Cabinet met today and said the question of sovereignty
over the islands must be decided “through peaceful diplomatic
channels or under the umbrella of the international law,”
according to a statement published on the  website  of ruler
Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum.  The Cabinet statement comes two weeks after the UAE
condemned a visit by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to
Abu Mousa, one of the three disputed islands, according to the
Emirates News Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
