Hungary plans to introduce a
minute-based tax on phone calls in July this year to help it
raise about 170 million euros ($225 million), after a previous
proposal for a  sales tax  on telecommunication companies was
challenged by the European Commission,  Welt newspaper  said.  A phone call using a mobile phone or a landline would be
taxed at 2 forint ($0.01) per minute, and mobile phone text
messages would also be taxed, the German newspaper reported in a
preview of an article to be published tomorrow. The report cited
unidentified people familiar with the government’s plan.  Telephone companies including  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s Magyar
Telekom Nyrt. would collect the tax themselves and transfer it
to the Hungarian government, Welt said. Hungary plans to inform
the European Union about the proposed tax this week, according
to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
