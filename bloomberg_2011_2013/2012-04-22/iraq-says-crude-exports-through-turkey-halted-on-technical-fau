Iraq halted crude exports from
northern  oil fields  because of a technical fault at a pipeline
network in neighboring Turkey, the Oil Ministry said.  The crude oil exports stopped at 7:45 p.m. yesterday, the
ministry said in a statement on the website of the official
National Media Center.  Transportation of Iraqi crude through the pipeline, which
terminates at the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, Turkey, has been
halted at least 13 times since November due to sabotage, bad
weather and technical reasons, according to the ministry.  Iraq normally exports 450,000 to 500,000 barrels a day from
northern oil fields through Turkey. It ships most of its crude
from the south on tankers sailing from the  Persian Gulf .  Iraq  pumped an average of 2.81 million barrels a day last
month, the third-largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, according to Bloomberg estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
