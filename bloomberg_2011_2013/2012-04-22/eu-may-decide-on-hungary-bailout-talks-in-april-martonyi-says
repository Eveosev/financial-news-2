of bailout talks among  Hungary , the  International Monetary Fund 
and the 27-member EU bloc in April, Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi said in an interview with television station  Hir TV .  “We have received news from the European Commission and
therefore we calculate that the decision on the start of
