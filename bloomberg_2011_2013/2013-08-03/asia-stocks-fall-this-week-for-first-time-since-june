Asian  shares  rose this week, driving
the regional benchmark index to its sixth week of gains, as
global manufacturing reports beat forecasts and central banks
vowed to maintain stimulus.  Hitachi Metals Ltd. soared 20 percent after forecasting net
income will more than double. Genting Malaysia Bhd., the casino
operator controlled by billionaire Lim Kok Thay, jumped 13
percent. Fanuc Corp. gained 9.5 percent after the Japanese
robotics maker’s orders beat estimates.  AIA Group Ltd. (1299) , the
second-largest Asia-based insurer by market value, advanced 3.6
percent after reporting net income climbed to a record $1.93
billion in the six months to May. Samsung Electronics world’s
biggest smartphone maker fell 1.3 percent as profit missed
expectations.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index edged up 0.1 percent this week
to 135.59, climbing for the sixth straight week with more than
two stocks gaining for every one that fell. Six of the 10
industry groups on the measure rose on the week. Japan’s market
drove the advance as the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average
posted a 2.4 percent increase, its biggest jump in a month.  “As the yen continues to weaken, profit at Japanese
exporters will improve. That should drive earnings upgrades,
boosting the share market,” said  Daphne Roth , Singapore-based
head of Asia equity research at ABN Amro Private Bank, which
oversees about $207 billion. “The market will remain volatile
as investors await Japan’s economic reforms.”  Regional Benchmarks  Japan’s Topix index gained 2.5 percent to 1,196.17 for the
week, as the yen weakened against the dollar, boosting the
earnings outlook for the country’s exporters. Of the 183
companies on the measure that have posted quarterly results and
for which Bloomberg has estimates, 58 percent  beat projections .  Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  climbed 1 percent after China’s
government moved to alleviate a cash crunch as economic growth
slows. The nation’s central bank injected funds into markets
through reverse-repurchase agreements for the first time since
February.  South Korea ’s  Kospi index  added 0.7 percent, while  Taiwan ’s
Taiex index fell 0.6 percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
gained 1.5 percent and  New Zealand ’s NZX 50 Index was little
changed for the week.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 1.3 percent in July
after  China  pledged to do more to support a transition from
reliance on exports to domestic demand in the world’s second-largest economy. Shares on the gauge traded at 13.2 times
estimated earnings as of yesterday, compared with multiples of
15.5 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 13.8 for the Stoxx
 Europe  600 Index.  Reverses Declines  The index reversed declines from earlier in the week after
the  Federal Open Market Committee , which has floated the
prospect of reductions to its $85 billion of monthly bond
purchases should economic risks abate, said on July 31 that
while growth should pick up, persistently low inflation may
hamper the recovery.  Factory output from the U.S. to China and Europe expanded
in July, reports showed on Aug. 1, while American jobless claims
fell to a five-year low. The data came as European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  said  interest rates  will probably remain
low for an extended period and after the  Federal Reserve 
retained its $85 billion-a-month bond buying program.  China’s manufacturing gauge unexpectedly strengthened in
July, data showed on Aug. 1. Manufacturing growth in the U.K.
accelerated in July, while a factory gauge for the euro-area
resumed growth after two years of contraction, separate reports
released showed on Aug. 1.  U.S. Data  In the U.S., unemployment insurance payments declined by
19,000 to 326,000 in the week ended July 27, the fewest since
January 2008, from a revised 345,000 the prior week. The
 Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. factory index increased
to 55.4 in July, the strongest since June 2011, from 50.9 in the
prior month. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.  “The Fed moved back slightly to the dovish side,” Evan Lucas, a Melbourne-based market strategist at IG Markets Ltd., a
provider of trading services for equities, currencies and
commodities, said by telephone. “The  U.S. economy  does look
like it’s growing a bit stronger and the Fed hasn’t said when it
will announce tapering.”  Hitachi Metals jumped 20 percent to 1,275 yen in  Tokyo 
after forecasting net income will more than double following its
July 1 merger with Hitachi Cable Ltd. Genting Malaysia rose 13
percent to 4.5 ringgit after announcing a $937 million revamping
of its Malaysian resort and a tie-up with 21st Century Fox Inc.
on a theme park.  Orders Swell  Fanuc jumped 9.5 percent to 15,990 yen after reporting
first quarter orders totaled 114 billion yen, beating Nomura
Holdings Inc.’s 105 billion yen estimate and JPMorgan Chase &
Co.’s outlook for 97.5 billion yen.  AIA Group, the second-largest Asia-based insurer by market
value, advanced 3.6 percent to HK$37.15 in Hong Kong after
reporting net income climbed to a record $1.93 billion in the
six months to May 31, from $1.44 billion a year earlier, helped
by acquisitions and paper gains from equity investments.  Samsung Electronics fell 1.3 percent to 1.286 million won
in  Seoul  this week. The world’s biggest smartphone maker
reported net income of 7.58 trillion won ($6.7 billion) on July
26, missing the 8.02 trillion-won average of 24 analyst
projections compiled by Bloomberg, as market saturation for
high-end handsets curbed sales growth for its flagship Galaxy
S4.  Honda Motor Co.,  Japan ’s third-biggest automaker, sank 2.1
percent to 3,710 yen in Tokyo, after saying net income fell 7
percent to 122.5 billion yen in the three months ended June 30,
from 131.7 billion yen a year earlier. That lagged behind the
149.3 billion yen-average of three analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
