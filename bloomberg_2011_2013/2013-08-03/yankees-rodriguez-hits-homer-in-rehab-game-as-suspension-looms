New York  Yankees third baseman  Alex Rodriguez  hit a two-run homer as his second injury
rehabilitation assignment began last night with the minor-league
Trenton Thunder.  Rodriguez, 38, walked in the first inning, hit a home run
in the third and struck out in the fifth as the Double-A Thunder
defeated the Reading Fightin Phils 6-2 at Arm & Hammer Park in
Trenton, New Jersey.  Rodriguez, who is fifth on the Major League Baseball career
list with 647 home runs, will play with the Thunder again today
with expectations of rejoining the Yankees on Aug. 5 unless he
is suspended for using performance-enhancing drugs.  Rodriguez, who hasn’t played with the Yankees this season
following hip surgery and thigh muscle tightness, is being
investigated by baseball for his ties to the now-shuttered
Biogenesis of America LLC clinic in  Coral Gables , Florida.  Rodriguez is one of 14 players expected to be suspended at
least 50 games for their ties to Biogenesis, the  Associated
Press  said.  MLB officials plan to issue two announcements no later than
Aug. 5 -- one listing players who have accepted suspensions and
the other naming those who have been banned and could still
challenge that discipline before an arbitrator, AP said, quoting
an unidentified person familiar with the process.  To contact the reporter on this story:
