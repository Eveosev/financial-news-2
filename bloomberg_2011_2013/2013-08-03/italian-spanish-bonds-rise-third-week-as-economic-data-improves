Italian and Spanish government bonds
advanced for a third week after reports showed factory output in
the euro area expanded for the first time in two years and the
number of people unemployed in  Germany  declined.  Italy’s 10-year securities extended their weekly winning
streak to the longest since May after European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  said economic indicators suggest the
region is past the worst of its longest-ever recession. Italy’s
bonds rallied even after the nation’s top court upheld former
Premier Silvio Berlusconi’s conviction for tax fraud,
threatening the stability of the ruling coalition. German bunds
were little changed after yields reached a three-week high.  “We’ve had some very good macro figures and ultimately if
you get decent growth in the periphery, and that’s still a big
if, who cares what happens to individual politicians?” said
 Luca Jellinek , head of European interest-rate strategy at Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in  London . “If you get the
sense there’s a possibility of decent growth then clearly these
bonds should do better.”  Italy’s 10-year yield fell 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, this week to close at 4.25 percent, the lowest
level since June 19. The 4.5 percent bond maturing in May 2023
rose 1.155, or 11.55 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,327) face amount,
to 102.29.  Similar-maturity  Spanish yields  dropped five basis points
this week to 4.57 percent.  ‘Further Improvement’  “Confidence indicators have shown some further improvement
from low levels and tentatively confirm the expectation of a
stabilization in economic activity,” Draghi said at a press
conference in  Frankfurt  on Aug. 1 after the ECB left its  main
refinancing rate  at a record-low 0.5 percent.  A euro-area manufacturing index based on a survey of
 purchasing managers  rose to 50.3 in July, surpassing the 50 mark
for the first time since July 2011, Markit Economics said Aug.
1. The number of people out of work in Germany dropped by a
seasonally adjusted 7,000 to 2.93 million in July, the Federal
Labor Agency said July 31.  Berlusconi’s conviction for  tax fraud , confirmed on Aug. 1
by Italy’s highest court, increased tensions in parliament and
risks undermining Prime Minister Enrico Letta’s government.
Members of Berlusconi’s party had threatened to bring down the
coalition if the conviction was confirmed.  Germany’s 10-year  yield  was little changed this week at
1.65 percent after rising to 1.73 percent yesterday, the highest
level since July 5.  Italian bonds returned 3.3 percent this year through Aug.
1, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spanish securities
gained 6.3 percent, while German bunds lost 1.3 percent.  Austria is scheduled to auction 770 million euros of 10-year bonds on Aug. 6, and Germany will sell 4 billion euros of
notes maturing in April 2018 the following day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
