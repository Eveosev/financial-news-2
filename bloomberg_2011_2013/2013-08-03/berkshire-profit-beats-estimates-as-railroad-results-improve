Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A)  said second-quarter profit beat analysts’ estimates as
earnings climbed at its utility business and railroad.  Net income  rose to $4.54 billion, or $2,763 a share, from
$3.11 billion, or $1,882, a year earlier, on gains in Buffett’s
derivative bets, the Omaha, Nebraska-based company said
yesterday in a filing. Operating earnings, which exclude some
investment results, were $2,384 a share, exceeding the $2,166
average  estimate  of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Berkshire has benefited this year as the  U.S. economy 
rebounded and stocks rallied, boosting the value of Buffett’s
 investments . The company’s operating units, including railroad
Burlington Northern  Santa Fe , auto insurer Geico and utility
MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., do most of their business in
the country.  “As America goes, so goes Berkshire,”  Meyer Shields , an
analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said in a phone interview
before results were announced.  Class A shares rose 0.5 percent to $176,500 yesterday in
 New York  prior to the release, extending their  advance  to 32
percent this year. That compares with the 20 percent rise in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Net income from BNSF climbed 10 percent to $884 million.
Revenue gained about 5 percent to $5.32 billion, on increases
tied to industrial and consumer products and coal. The railroad
expects capital commitments this year will be $4.3 billion, or
$200 million more than previously disclosed, BNSF said in a
separate filing.  Stock Picks  Spending on plant and equipment, acquisitions and equities,
are helping Berkshire deploy its cash pile. Buffett’s firm spent
$4.64 billion on stocks in the quarter, while selling $781
million, according to the filing. Most of the increase was in
the category that Berkshire labels as “commercial, industrial
and other.”  Berkshire’s stock portfolio was valued at $103.3 billion on
June 30, up from $97.2 billion at the end of March. Book value,
a measure of assets minus liabilities, rose to about $122,900 a
share on June 30 from $120,525 on March 31. The cash pile fell
27 percent in three months to $35.7 billion as Berkshire
invested more than $12 billion in a deal with  Jorge Paulo Lemann ’s 3G Capital to take HJ Heinz Co. private.  Buffett’s company has an $8 billion preferred stake in the
ketchup maker and half the common stock, or 425 million shares.
Berkshire also has warrants to buy 46 million additional Heinz
shares for 1 cent each, yesterday’s filing showed.  MidAmerican added $279 million to Berkshire’s profit
compared with $253 million in last year’s second quarter on
higher earnings at utility PacifiCorp and real-estate broker
HomeServices of America.  Derivative Bets  Buffett’s derivative bets on stock market gains boosted
earnings by $390 million in the second quarter, compared with a
loss of $1.17 billion a year earlier. Fluctuations in the value
of the contracts are recorded in net income each quarter, even
though the wagers won’t be settled until 2018 or later.  The insurance segment’s underwriting profit slipped 14
percent from last year’s second quarter to $530 million as
flooding in  Europe  boosted  General Re ’s claims. Geico’s
underwriting profit was $336 million before tax. Insurance
investment income rose about 7 percent to $1.14 billion.  In the past 15 years, Buffett, 82, shifted toward more
capital-intensive industries, purchasing MidAmerican, the
railroad and manufacturing companies. Those bets have tethered
its results more to the U.S. economy and the housing market.
Buffett is Berkshire’s chairman, CEO and largest shareholder.  Among the company’s units are paintmaker Benjamin Moore;
 Clayton Homes , a builder of manufactured housing; and
HomeServices. Buffett’s firm is also the  largest shareholder  in
 Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the biggest U.S. mortgage lender.  Gains in housing have helped propel a rebound in the U.S.
economy. Gross domestic product rose at a 1.7 percent annualized
rate in the second quarter, after a 1.1 percent gain in the
first three months of the year, Commerce Department figures
showed this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
