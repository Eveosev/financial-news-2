The Chiefs came from behind to defeat
the ACT Brumbies 27-22 and claim their second consecutive Super
Rugby title.  Liam Messam and Robbie Robinson scored tries in the final
17 minutes as the Chiefs rallied from a 22-12 deficit in front
of a home crowd of 25,000 at Waikato Stadium in Hamilton,  New
Zealand . Fly-half Aaron Cruden kicked five penalties and a
conversion to finish with 17 points.  The Chiefs’ victory was the 12th for a New Zealand team in
the 18 editions of the Southern Hemisphere’s provincial
championship.  Christian Leali’ifano accounted for all 22 points for the
Brumbies, who won the Australian conference. He scored one try,
which he converted, and also kicked five penalties.  The Canberra-based Brumbies were seeking their third title,
having won in 2001 and 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
