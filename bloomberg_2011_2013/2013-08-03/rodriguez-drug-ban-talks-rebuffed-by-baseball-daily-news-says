Alex Rodriguez of the New York
Yankees faces a suspension through at least next season after
Major League Baseball officials rebuffed his request to
negotiate a ban for drug use, the Daily News of New York
reported.  Rodriguez, who has baseball’s richest contract at 10 years
and $275 million and leads active players with 647 home runs,
was turned away after comments in a news conference last night
in which he questioned the motives of MLB and the Yankees in
looking into his involvement with a shuttered anti-aging clinic
in  Florida  linked to providing performance-enhancing substances
to ballplayers, the newspaper said on its website, citing an
unidentified person in baseball familiar with the case.  Rodriguez will be banned for at least 214 games, which
would stretch through the 2014 season, the Daily News said. The
All-Star third baseman and three-time American League Most
Valuable Player may be added to the Yankees’ 25-man roster in
two days. He has been recovering from hip surgery in January.  Pat Courtney, a spokesman for MLB, didn’t immediately
return an e-mail seeking comment on the Daily News report.  In a news conference after a minor-league rehab game in
Trenton, New Jersey, last night, Rodriquez said he wanted to
help rid baseball of drugs. He also said there were “benefits”
from him not returning to the major leagues and “that’s not my
teammates and it’s not the Yankee fan.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
