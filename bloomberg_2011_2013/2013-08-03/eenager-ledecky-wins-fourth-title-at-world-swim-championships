Katie Ledecky of the U.S. won her
fourth title at the world swimming championships, setting a
world record in the 800-meter freestyle and completing a sweep
of the three women’s distance events.  Ledecky, a 16-year-old Olympic gold medalist from Bethesda,
 Maryland , won in 8 minutes, 13.86 seconds at the meet in
Barcelona. She pulled ahead of Denmark’s Lotte Friis with three
lengths of the 50-meter pool left, after trailing by as much as
a body length in the early going. Lauren Boyle of  New Zealand 
finished third.  Ledecky earlier won the 400- and 1,500-meter freestyle
titles, and was part of the winning U.S. 800-meter freestyle
relay team. She has never lost at a major international meet.  Rebecca Adlington of Britain held the 800 freestyle world
mark, 8:14.10, set at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, when
polyester bodysuits were allowed.  Another American teenager and Olympic champion, 18-year-old
Missy Franklin of Centennial,  Colorado , won the 200-meter
backstroke for her fifth title of the meet, and goes for a
record-matching sixth gold medal in the 400-meter medley relay
tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
