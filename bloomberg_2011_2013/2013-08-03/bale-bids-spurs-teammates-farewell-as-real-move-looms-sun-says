Gareth Bale bid farewell to his
Tottenham teammates as he prepares to join Real Madrid, the Sun
reported.  Real is closing in on a world-record 95 million-pound ($145
million) move for the Welsh winger, who yesterday said good-bye
to coach Andre Villas Boas and Spurs players prior to their
departure for an exhibition game in Monaco, the Sun said.
Several players asked Bale to sign shirts for them, the
newspaper said.  Bale, 24, reiterated his desire to leave Tottenham in a
meeting with club chairman  Daniel Levy  this week and Real coach
 Carlo Ancelotti  confirmed yesterday talks are ongoing, the Sun
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
