Canada ’s dollar dropped for the first
time in four weeks as government reports showed the economy
growing at slower pace than in the U.S., the nation’s largest
trading partner.  The currency slid versus 12 of its 16 most-traded peers
even after data yesterday showed the U.S. added fewer-than-forecast jobs last month. Benchmark Canadian government 10-year
bonds fell for a second week, pushing yields to a two-year high.
Payrolls in the nation began expanding again in July, a
government report next week is forecast to show.  “The Canadian dollar will be wholly dependent on what
happens in the  United States , with growth prospects and
therefore with tapering” of stimulus by the  Federal Reserve ,
said  Dean Popplewell , head analyst in Toronto at the online
currency-trading firm Oanda Corp. “Until the Fed actually
indicates that it’s not going to be September, everyone is
viewing it as a forgone conclusion.”  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed for the image of
the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, weakened 1.1 percent to C$1.0392
per  U.S. dollar  this week in Toronto. One Canadian dollar
purchases 96.23 U.S. cents.  Canada’s currency touched C$1.0246, the strongest level in
six weeks, on July 31 before declining to C$1.0403 yesterday, a
two-week low. It gained 1 percent over the past six months
against nine developed-nation counterparts tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes, while its U.S. counterpart
strengthened 5.8 percent.  Bonds Fall  Yields (GCAN10YR)  on 10-year Canadian-government bonds touched 2.6
percent yesterday, the highest level since August 2011, before
closing at 2.49 percent. For the week, the yields rose four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point. The price of the 1.5
percent security due in June 2023 decreased 30 cents to C$91.46.  The loonie briefly erased losses yesterday against the U.S.
dollar amid bets the Fed might maintain monetary stimulus after
data showed American nonfarm payrolls grew by 162,000 workers in
July, trailing a forecast of 185,000, even as the jobless rate
fell to 7.4 percent, from 7.6 percent.  The figures followed reports this week that showed the  U.S.
economy  expanded at an annualized rate of 1.7 percent in the
second quarter, versus a forecast of 1 percent in a Bloomberg
survey, while  home prices  rose in May by the most since 2006 and
manufacturing expanded in July more than forecast.  No Appetite  “It’s certainly not a game changer,” Adam Button, a
currency analyst in  Montreal  at forexlive.com, said yesterday of
the U.S. payrolls report. “The other U.S. data this week were
great, and if you look at it as a whole, it’s still pointing
more toward a September taper than it was a week ago. Despite
nonfarm payrolls, the market wants to be in U.S. dollars. The
appetite to buy Canadian dollars just isn’t there.”  U.S. policy makers are discussing whether the world’s
biggest economy has improved enough for them to start slowing
the pace of their monthly bond purchases, which tend to devalue
the greenback. The Fed buys $85 billion of Treasuries and
mortgage debt each month in its quantitative-easing strategy to
put downward pressure on borrowing costs.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told Congress in July that any
reduction in stimulus would depend on the economy’s performance.
Half of 54 economists surveyed by Bloomberg last month said the
Fed may decide at its Sept. 17-18 policy meeting to reduce the
purchases to $65 billion a month.  Canadian GDP  Canada’s gross domestic product rose 0.2 percent in May
from 0.1 percent the month before, the government reported July
31 in Ottawa. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had estimated 0.3
percent growth.  The nation’s economy added 10,000 jobs last month, after
losing 400 in June, a Bloomberg survey forecast before a
Statistics Canada report due Aug. 9. Payrolls surged by 95,000
new positions in May, the most in a decade, and rose by 12,500
in April. The  unemployment rate  was 7.1 percent in July,
unchanged from June and May, economists projected.  The  Bank of Canada  last month raised its growth forecast
for the nation’s economy this year to 1.8 percent, from an April
prediction of 1.5 percent, while lowering the 2014 projection to
2.7 percent, from 2.8 percent. Both figures exceed Bloomberg
consensus forecasts of 1.7 percent and 2.4 percent.  Futures traders decreased for a third week their  bets  that
the Canadian dollar will decline against the U.S. currency,
figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a decline in Canada’s currency
compared with those on a gain -- so-called net shorts -- was
11,434 on July 30, compared with net shorts of 16,758 a week
earlier. This week’s total was the least in a month.  Volatility Rises  Implied volatility for three-month options on the Canadian
dollar versus its U.S. counterpart ended the week at 7.1 percent
after touching 6.8 percent on July 22, the lowest since May 13
on a closing basis. It reached a one-year high of 8.9 percent on
June 24. Implied volatility is used to set option prices and
gauge the expected pace of currency swings.  The loonie slid this week even as oil, Canada’s biggest
export, and other commodities rose. Crude futures advanced 2.1
percent to $106.94 a barrel in  New York , and Standard & Poor’s
 GSCI Index (SPGSCI)  of raw materials increased 0.9 percent. The S&P 500
Index of stocks rose 1.1 percent.  Canada’s dollar rallied 2.4 percent in July against the
greenback in the biggest gain since October 2011 as the price of
oil gained the most since August 2012. Futures on crude rose 8.8
percent last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
