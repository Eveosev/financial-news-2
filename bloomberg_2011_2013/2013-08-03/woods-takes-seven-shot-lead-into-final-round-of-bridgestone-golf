Tiger Woods  takes a seven-shot lead
into the fourth round of the Bridgestone Invitational, the final
tune-up for the last major of the men’s golf season, the  PGA
Championship .  Following a 61 that matched his lowest score in a
professional tour event, Woods shot a 2-under-par 68 yesterday
at Firestone Country Club in Akron, Ohio, for a three-round
total of 195.  “You know, today was a day that I didn’t quite have it,”
Woods told reporters yesterday. “But I scored and that’s the
name of the game, posting a number, and I did today. I grinded
my way around that golf course.”  Henrik Stenson of  Sweden  is second at 202, after a third-round 67. The final round of the World Golf Championships event
is set for today.  “It’s kind of tough to pick up seven or eight shots on
Tiger around here,” Stenson said. “It would take something
spectacular on my behalf or any of the other guys around me, and
obviously a very, very poor round for him.”  Woods, the No. 1 player on the Official World Golf Ranking
and a 14-time major-championship winner, goes for his first
major title in more than five years next week in the PGA at Oak
Hill Country Club in Rochester,  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
