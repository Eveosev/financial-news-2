Wigan routed Barnsley 4-0 in its
return to English soccer’s Championship, as Queens Park Rangers
and Reading also won their first games back in the second
division.  QPR beat Sheffield Wednesday 2-1 and Reading defeated
Ipswich by the same score as the lower leagues in  England  opened
their seasons.  Wigan, QPR and Reading were demoted to the Championship
after finishing as the bottom three in the Premier League last
season. Wigan had spent the past eight years in the top flight,
QPR the past two and Reading just one.  Ben Watson ,  Grant Holt , Leon Barnett and Shaun Maloney all
scored for Wigan. The Latics last season became the first team
demoted from the Premier League after winning the F.A. Cup.  Barnsley finished with 10 men after Dale Jenning received a
red card in the 60th minute.  Nedum Onuoha and Andrew Johnson scored just before halftime
to give QPR the home win over Sheffield Wednesday, which got a
goal from Atdhe Nuhiu. QPR was winless in its first 16 games in
the Premier League last season.  Danny Guthrie’s goal in the 75th minute gave Reading the
home win over Ipswich. Adam Le Fondre also scored for the Royals
after Jay Tabb put Ipswich in front in the 16th minute.  In other finals in the Championship, it was Bournemouth 2,
Charlton 1; Leicester City 2, Middlesbrough 1; Nottingham Forest
1, Huddersfield 0; Watford 1, Birmingham 0; Blackpool 3,
Doncaster 1; Leeds 2, Brighton 1; Yeovil 1, Millwall 0; and
Burnley 1, Bolton 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
