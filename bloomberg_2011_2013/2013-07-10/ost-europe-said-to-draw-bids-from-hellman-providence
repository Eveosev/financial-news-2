Hellman & Friedman LLC and
Providence Equity Partners Inc. are among the bidders for Anglo-German Internet domain and hosting company Host Europe Group
Ltd., people familiar with the process said.  The company, owned by Montagu Private Equity LLP, will
probably fetch at least 400 million pounds ($593 million), said
three people, who asked not to be identified because the talks
are private. Final bids are due at the end of the month, they
said.  The auction process, run by  UBS AG (UBSN) , also includes strategic
bidders such as Arizona-based IO Data Centers LLC and  Deutsche
Telekom AG (DTE) , the people said.  Montagu bought Host Europe in October 2010 from Oakley
Capital Private Equity LP in a deal that valued the business at
222 million pounds, according to a  statement  on Montagu’s
 website .  The company, which has operations in the U.K.,  Germany  and
Spain, offers its customers domain registration as well as
shared and managed hosting for their activities.  Spokesmen for Deutsche Telekom, Hellman and Providence
declined to comment on the talks. Spokeswomen for IO Data
Centers and UBS didn’t immediately respond to requests for
comment. Officials at Montagu also declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
