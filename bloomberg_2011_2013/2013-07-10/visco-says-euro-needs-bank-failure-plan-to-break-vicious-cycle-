European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ignazio Visco pushed euro-area governments to
agree on a common plan for dealing with failing banks, saying
the current fragmented approach won’t insulate sovereign
borrowers from financial-company weakness.  Current agreements “won’t break the vicious circle between
the conditions of sovereign debtors and those of the banks and
eliminate the national fragmentation of financial markets,”
Visco, also governor of the  Bank of Italy , said in the text of
speech delivered today in  Rome .  “As soon as possible, we need to implement a European
resolution mechanism, complete with a single resolution
authority and common resources with the ability to confront
systemic crises and avoid contagion,” he said.  The European Commission is unveiling its proposal for a
single bank resolution mechanism today in Brussels. The plan,
presented by financial services chief  Michel Barnier , pushes the
EU’s executive arm toward a showdown with  Germany , the area’s
biggest economy. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble
yesterday urged the commission to use restraint when making its
case for the plan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
