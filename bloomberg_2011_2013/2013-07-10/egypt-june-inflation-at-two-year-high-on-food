Egypt ’s inflation accelerated to 9.8
percent, the most in two years, a jump that threatens to further
complicate President Adly Mansour’s efforts to revive the
economy and avert more bloodshed after the ouster of Mohamed Mursi.  Inflation increased from 8.2 percent in May and was its
highest since July 2011’s 10.4 percent. Consumer prices rose 0.9
percent from the previous month.  The food and beverage sub-index jumped 12.7 percent from
the year-ago month. Rising food prices are pressuring the
interim government as it seeks to conclude a long-stalled $4.8
billion International Monetary Fund loan.  Hundreds of thousands of Egyptians took to the streets in
June to protest Mursi’s rule, spurring army generals to oust him
on July 3. Hazem El-Beblawi was appointed interim prime minister
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
