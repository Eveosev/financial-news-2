HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Europe ’s largest
lender, said it hired four traders and two salesmen in London as
it plans to grow its credit business in the region.  Andrew McMillan joins as a managing director, head of high-yield and leveraged sales and Jack Czarnota assumes the role of
director in high-yield sales, according to an e-mailed statement
from the bank today. Dan Cohen is becoming a director in high-yield trading, while Christian Evans and Chris Case join as
directors in financials trading. Eugene Gorelik is named as a
director in securitisation trading, according to the statement.  “HSBC is looking to capitalise on the growing opportunity
in Europe in the credit markets,” the company said in the
statement. “The opportunity is driven by the increased use of
the  bond market  by European corporate treasurers. This is
driving increased corporate origination volumes in the high
yield, hybrid capital as well as in the infrastructure
securitisation space.”  Stephen Butcher is said to have left the bank where he was
head of high-yield sales, a person familiar said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
