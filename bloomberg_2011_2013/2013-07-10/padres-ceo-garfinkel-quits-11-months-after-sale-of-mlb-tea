Tom Garfinkel resigned as president
and chief executive officer of the  San Diego Padres , 11 months
after the Major League Baseball team came under new ownership.  Garfinkel’s resignation was accepted yesterday by Peter Seidler, lead investor of the Padres, and Executive Chairman Ron Fowler, according to the team’s website.  Fowler, who will take over Garfinkel’s duties until a
replacement is found, and Seidler thanked Garfinkel for “many
contributions to the Padres over the last four years.”  Fowler, chairman of closely held Liquid Investments Inc.,
and his group paid $800 million for the franchise that hasn’t
won a World Series championship since joining the National
League in 1969. The sale was approved by the other MLB owners
Aug. 16.  “I want to thank the Padres and the fans for the
opportunity to be a small part of this incredible franchise,”
Garfinkel said in a statement on MLB.com. “I have a lot of
faith in the people in this organization and that great things
are on the horizon.”  Garfinkel was made president and chief operating officer of
the Padres in April 2009 and was promoted to CEO three years
later. He was brought to  San Diego  by former Padres vice
chairman and CEO Jeff Moorad, who had owned the franchise since
1994.  The Padres are in last place in the five-team  National
League West .  To contact the reporter on this story:
