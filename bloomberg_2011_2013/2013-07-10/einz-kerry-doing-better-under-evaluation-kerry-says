Secretary of State  John Kerry  said
his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, who remains in a Boston hospital,
is under evaluation and “we hope” improving.  “Teresa is doing better” and “we hope, improving,” said
Kerry, pausing for a moment as his voice broke. “I want to
thank everyone for the remarkable outpouring of good wishes.”  “We are very, very humbled by the expressions of
support,” Kerry said today at the opening of two days of
meetings in Washington between U.S. and Chinese officials. “I
think she’s coming along and I know when she’s able, she’ll
thank everybody herself.”  Heinz Kerry was hospitalized after suffering seizure-like
symptoms on July 7 during a family vacation. Kerry will return
to  Boston  today and spend the next few days there, State
Department spokesman Jennifer Psaki said. Deputy Secretary Bill Burns will take Kerry’s place in the talks with  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
