Western Canada Select oil weakened
on the spot market as  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO)  said the Kearl oil-sands
project in  Alberta  is on track to reach its full capacity of
110,000 barrels a day by the end of this year, increasing
supplies of Canadian heavy crude.  The first of Kearl’s three mining trains is running,
Imperial CEO Rich Kruger said at a conference in Calgary.  “On any given day, as we continue to synchronize, it can
be at that capacity, which would be 35,000 to 40,000 barrels a
day,” Kruger said. “We’ve had ups and downs in the first few
months, not unusual for a project of this size.”  Western Canadian Select heavy oil for September delivery
declined 75 cents to a $22-a-barrel discount to U.S. benchmark
West Texas Intermediate oil as of 4:24 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Calgary oil broker Net Energy Inc. The grade, a
blend of heavy oils including oil-sands bitumen like that
produced at Kearl, also weakened by 20 cents to a $16.45-a-barrel discount for August delivery.  Kruger said Imperial is in the final stages of
commissioning Kearl’s second and third trains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
