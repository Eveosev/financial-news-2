XL Group Plc (XL)  said it’s among the
insurers of the railroad that had Canada’s worst rail disaster
in 27 years.  XL “can confirm that we are an insurer of the Montreal,
Maine & Atlantic Railway,” said Christine Weirsky, a
spokeswoman for the Dublin-based insurer, in an e-mail today.
“We are on the scene working closely with the company and
authorities and our thoughts and prayers are with the
community.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
