The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
dropped, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 3 basis points to 152.5 basis
points as of 8:52 a.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The measure is set to close at its lowest
level since July 2, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 2 basis points
to 129 as of 10:18 a.m. in Sydney, National Australia Bank Ltd.
prices show. The benchmark is poised for its lowest close since
June 19, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index decreased 0.5 of a basis
point to 102.5 as of 9:17 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. The gauge, which has ranged from 74 to 148.1 this year, is
on track to fall 7.3 basis points this month, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
