The euro and pound will weaken to
more than three-year lows against the dollar by year-end as the
central banks of the euro area and U.K. extend easy monetary
policies that tend to debase currencies, according to  UBS AG. (UBSN)   “The commitment by the European Central Bank and the Bank
of England to keep interest rates low for extended periods is
likely to cause the euro and the pound to weaken now when
investors turn risk-seeking,” Mansoor Mohi-uddin, chief
currency strategist in  Singapore , wrote in a client note today.  The bank forecasts the euro will weaken to $1.20 by Dec. 31
and the pound will drop to $1.41. The shared currency last
touched that level in June 2010, while sterling hasn’t declined
to $1.41 since March 2009. Economists project the euro to close
the year at $1.27 and the pound at $1.50, according to median
estimates in Bloomberg surveys.  ECB President Mario Draghi and U.K. policy makers pledged
to keep borrowing costs at record lows on July 4 after their
respective rate-setting meetings. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said on June 19 the central bank may begin to slow
its $85 billion-per-month stimulus program this year should the
U.S. economy meet its goals for sustainable growth.  Policy divergence across the central banks will strengthen
the dollar because the ECB and Bank of  England ’s low interest-rate policies will induce risk-seeking investors to shun the
euro and the pound in favor of higher-yielding foreign assets,
Mohi-uddin said.  The euro gained 0.4 percent to $1.2826 at 2:10 p.m. London
time. It fell to a three-month low of $1.2755 yesterday. The
pound rose 0.2 percent to $1.4901 after dropping to $1.4814
yesterday, the weakest level since June 23, 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
