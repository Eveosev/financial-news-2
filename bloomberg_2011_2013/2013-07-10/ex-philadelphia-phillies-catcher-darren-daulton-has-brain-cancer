Former Philadelphia Phillies All-Star catcher Darren Daulton has brain cancer, his foundation
said nine days after he had surgery to remove two brain tumors.  “Darren and his family wish to thank everyone for their
loving support throughout this difficult time,” the Darren
Daulton Foundation said yesterday in a statement on its website.  Daulton, 51, hadn’t been feeling well in recent weeks and
was struggling to fully express himself, prompting him to visit
a doctor who discovered the tumors. He had surgery July 1.  Daulton played 14 seasons in Philadelphia from 1983 to 1996
before a final season with the Florida Marlins, who won the
World Series. He was also on the Phillies’ team that took the
National League pennant in 1993.  Daulton had a .245 career batting average with 137 home
runs and 588 runs batted in, earning All-Star Game invitations
in 1992, 1993 and 1995.  Nicknamed “Dutch,” Daulton hosts the 97.5 radio show
“Talking Baseball With Dutch.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
