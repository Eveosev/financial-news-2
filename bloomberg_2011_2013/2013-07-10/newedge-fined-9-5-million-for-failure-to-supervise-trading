Newedge USA LLC, the brokerage co-owned by  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  and  Societe Generale SA (GLE) , was fined
$9.5 million by regulators and exchanges for breaking rules
including a failure to supervise trading by clients.  The broker agreed to pay the fine jointly to the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq
Stock Market and Bats Exchange Inc., according to Finra  records .
Newedge also agreed to retain an independent consultant to
review how it runs its equities business, the records show.  The case involved computer-driven trading firms that used
Newedge to connect to exchanges, the Wall Street Journal
reported earlier today, citing documents the newspaper said it
reviewed.  Newedge agreed to the fine without admitting or denying the
allegations, according to the records. Richard Newman, a Newedge
spokesman in London, said the case didn’t involve the company’s
“core futures business” and declined further comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
