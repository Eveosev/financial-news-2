Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG)  cut
its stake in  Gagfah SA (GFJ) , the second-largest owner of German
homes, to less than 50 percent as part of a transaction in which
Gagfah also sold shares.  Fortress, a private-equity and hedge-fund manager, sold 20
million Gagfah shares to reduce its holding to 48.8 percent,
according to a statement today. Gagfah sold 10.5 million
treasury shares and 9.5 million new shares for 8.85 euros each,
raising about 176 million euros ($226 million).  Fortress previously owned about 61 percent of Gagfah,
according to the statement. The New York-based firm’s assets
under management were $55.6 billion as of March 31, a 4 percent
increase from the end of 2012, according to a May 2 report.  “Gagfah is on track to become a more conventional
residential real estate company,” Andre Remke, an analyst at
Baader Bank with a buy rating on the stock, said in a research
note today. The company “can now refocus on operational
performance and investments,” he said.  Gagfah fell 6.5 percent to 8.75 euros at the close in
 Frankfurt , the biggest percentage drop since January 2012. The
 shares  have lost 1.3 percent this year.  The Luxembourg-based company said yesterday it will resume
 dividend payments  in 2015. The last payment was in 2011. Gagfah
said last month it was issuing a 2 billion-euro commercial-mortgage backed security to pay most of its debt.  Gagfah also reiterated a forecast that funds from
operations will rise by 5 percent to 10 percent per share this
year. The company is targeting an increase of 7.5 percent to
12.5 percent for 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
