Egypt ’s credit risk headed for the
biggest drop in more than two years and bonds gained after Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait pledged $12 billion
of aid and as the new premier builds a government.  Five-year credit default swaps, which protect investors
against potential non-payment of debt, fell 142 basis points to
675 as of 5:04 p.m. in Cairo, according to data provider CMA.
That’s a 17 percent decline, the steepest on a closing basis
since February 2011. The yield on the government’s benchmark
5.75 percent bonds due April 2020 tumbled 68 basis points to
8.71 percent, set for the lowest close in more than three weeks.  Egyptian shares also advanced after the aid pledges, which
came on the same day that Hazem El-Beblawi was selected as
interim prime minister to oversee a transitional government
after the army removed President Mohamed Mursi a week ago. El-Beblawi, a former finance minister, and interim President Adly Mansour are confronting growing violence since the ouster,
including the July 8 killing of dozens of the Mursi’s supporters
by the army.  “Gulf aid providers now see the deadlock in Egypt as
broken,”  Mona Mansour , head of research at Cairo-based CI
Capital, said by phone. “Their willingness to support the
transition government with cash supports foreign reserves and
the currency, and allows future lifting of capital controls.”  Local Buyers  There were 12 trades covering $61 million of Egypt’s debt
in the week through July 5, bringing the total outstanding to
953 contracts covering a net $355 million, according to
Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.  data .  The benchmark EGX 30 Index advanced 0.7 percent to 5,325.14
as 25 stocks rose. The measure jumped 3.3 percent yesterday,
before the aid announcement. About 510 million Egyptian pounds
($73 million) of shares traded today, compared with a daily
average of 391 million pounds in the past year.  Local investors were net buyers today while non-Arab
foreign investors  were net sellers  for a seventh day, reducing
their holdings by 60 million pounds, according to Egyptian
Exchange data. That takes their sell-off over the period to
about 378 million pounds.  EFG-Hermes Holding SAE, the country’s biggest investment
bank, increased 3.4 percent to 8.91 Egyptian pounds, the highest
since June 2. Cairo-based private-equity firm Citadel Capital
SAE rose 2.8 percent to 3.34 pounds, the highest since May 22,
after its first-quarter loss narrowed. The stock exchange closed
an hour earlier, at 1:30 p.m. Cairo time, for the Islamic holy
month of Ramadan, which started today.  Foreign Reserves  The pound, whose movement on the interbank market is
controlled by the central bank, strengthened 0.2 percent to
7.0092 a dollar, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
gain came after the central bank sold $38.8 million at a
currency auction at a weighted average price of 6.9992 pounds
compared with 7.0097 at a similar sale July 8.  The regulator started those sales to limit banks’ access to
dollars in order to stem a drop in foreign reserves, which fell
to $14.9 billion last month.  Saudi Arabia offered $5 billion, including $1 billion in
cash, $2 billion of petroleum products and gas, and a $2 billion
deposit with the central bank. The U.A.E. package includes a $1
billion grant and a $2 billion interest-free deposit with the
Egyptian central bank.  Kuwait  said it would provide $4 billion
after the stock market closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
