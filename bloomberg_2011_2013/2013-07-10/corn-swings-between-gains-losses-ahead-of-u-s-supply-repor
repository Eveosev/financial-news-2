Wheat gained for a third straight
day on signs of increased demand for U.S. inventories from  China 
amid declining global stockpiles. Soybeans advanced while corn
was little changed.  China has purchased 1.32 million metric tons of U.S. wheat
since July 3, including 840,000 tons on July 8, Department of
Agriculture data show. The country will import 5.5 million tons
in the year that started on June 1, the most in nine years,
according to a survey of traders and researchers in the Asian
nation. World stockpiles will total 180.59 million tons,
according to a separate U.S. survey, down 0.4 percent from a
June USDA outlook.  “If China doesn’t have the stockpiles on hand they’ve been
saying they have,” the country may need to import more, Louise Gartner, the owner of Spectrum Commodities in Beavercreek,  Ohio ,
said by telephone. “I think they’re afraid of running out.”  Wheat futures for September delivery rose 0.2 percent to
settle at $6.79 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade. The price rallied 2.7 percent in the previous two
sessions.  Soybean futures for November delivery gained 0.7 percent to
$12.8475 a bushel on the CBOT. Corn futures for December
delivery slipped less than 0.1 percent to $5.215 a bushel in
Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
