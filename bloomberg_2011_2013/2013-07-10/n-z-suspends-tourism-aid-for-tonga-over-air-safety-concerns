New Zealand  said tourism aid to
Tonga will remain suspended until safety concerns about a
Chinese-made aircraft gifted to the tiny South Pacific nation
are resolved.  A planned tourism support program worth NZ$10.5 million ($8
million) over three years was put on hold earlier this year
after the New Zealand-run Chathams Pacific airline announced it
was pulling out of Tonga, Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully said in a statement. It will remain on hold until safety
concerns about a Xian MA60 aircraft gifted to Tonga by  China  are
resolved, he said.  “Significant safety issues have been raised regarding the
plans of the new air service operator,” McCully said. “Our
tourism support will remain on hold until safety issues are
resolved to the satisfaction of respected international aviation
experts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
