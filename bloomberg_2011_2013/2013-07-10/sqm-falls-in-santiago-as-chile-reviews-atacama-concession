Soc. Quimica y Minera de Chile SA ,
the South American country’s largest fertilizer producer,
dropped the most in three weeks as Diario Financiero said the
government may review terms of its largest mining concession.  The shares fell 2 percent to 19,880 pesos at 1:10 p.m. in
Santiago, the biggest decline on a closing basis since June 20.
The IPSA benchmark index retreated 0.5 percent.  Chile’s state development agency, Corp. de Fomento de la
Produccion, or Corfo, said it will review terms of the contract
signed in 1993 that grants SQM rights to extract lithium from
the Salar de Atacama saltbed, Corfo’s legal counsel, Marco
Riveros, told the Santiago-based newspaper. The contract is
deficient, Riveros was cited as saying.  “We expect some negative pressure on the stock while the
review of the contract continues,” Santiago-based brokerage
BICE Inversiones said today in an e-mailed  note .  BICE said SQM will probably hold on to the concession
because the only provision for termination is if the mining
company fails to pay royalties. The concession is due to end in
2030, according to BICE.  SQM obtained 35 percent of gross profit margin from the
lithium and potassium it extracts from the Atacama saltbed,
according to BICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
