Rising temperatures may increase
risks for U.K. agricultural production as water supplies become
more scarce in the next decade, said an independent adviser to
the government on  climate change .  The U.K. should improve irrigation efficiency and give
farmers incentives to increase water-storage facilities in
preparation for drier seasons, the London-based Committee on
Climate Change said today in a  report . A dry year in the 2020s
might result in a water shortage of as much as 120 billion
liters (31.7 billion gallons), equal to the amount farmers use
now to irrigate crops in a typical year, it said.  “Much of the cropland in  England  is located in areas where
water resources are already overstretched,” the committee said.
“These pressures are likely to grow from the combined effects
of climate change and increased demand from economic and
population growth.”  Fertile topsoils are becoming eroded and are at risk of
disappearing in the East Anglia Fens in the next few decades,
according to the report. The group advised putting in place
soil-conservation practices such as reduced plowing.  Today’s report is the latest annual study prepared by the
committee’s Adaptation Sub-Committee to assess the U.K.’s
preparedness for climate change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
