Edward Burkhardt, CEO of Rail World
Inc., owner of the Montreal Maine & Atlantic Railway Ltd., said
he believes the engineer failed to properly set the hand brakes
on the train that crashed and exploded in the town of Lac-Megantic,  Quebec , killing 15.  “I think they failed to set the brakes in the first
place,” Burkhardt told reporters in the town today. “As a
matter of fact, I’ll say they weren’t or we wouldn’t have had
this incident.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
