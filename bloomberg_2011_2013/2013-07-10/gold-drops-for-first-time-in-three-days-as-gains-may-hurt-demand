Gold futures jumped to a one-week
high as minutes from the  Federal Reserve ’s last meeting showed
many officials want to see more signs of employment picking up
before they begin slowing the pace of bond purchases.  “Many members indicated that further improvement in the
outlook for the labor market” is needed before tapering the
rate of asset buying, according to the record of the  Federal
Open Market Committee ’s June gathering released today. The
jobless rate held at 7.6 percent in June. Bullion doubled from
the end of 2008 to a record $1,923.70 in September 2011 as
record global stimulus boosted the appeal of inflation hedges.  “The gold market is pleasantly surprised, and is rallying
on the minutes,” Tom Power, a senior commodity broker at R.J.
O’Brien & Associates in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.
“The unemployment number is the key number that the Fed is
watching, and with that still above 7.5 percent, investors think
that easing is here to stay for some time.”  Gold futures for August delivery climbed 0.3 percent to
$1,249.10 in electronic trading at 3:08 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price touched $1,264.50, the highest for a
most-active contract since July 2. The metal settled up 0.1
percent at $1,247.40 at the close of regular trading.  Through yesterday, gold dropped 26 percent this year,
erasing $62 billion from the value of  exchange-traded products 
backed by the metal, as some investors lost faith in bullion as
a store of value.  Fed officials met before the Labor Department’s jobs report
for the month of June exceeded expectations, with the economy
adding 195,000 jobs.  The central bank began purchasing $40 billion a month of
mortgage backed securities in September and announced $45
billion a month of Treasury purchases in December. The program,
known as QE3 for the Fed’s third round of quantitative easing,
has expanded the central bank’s  balance sheet  to a record $3.49
trillion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
