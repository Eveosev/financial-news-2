Italian government bonds declined
for a second day after Standard & Poor’s cut the nation’s credit
rating, citing a weakening of the country’s economic prospects.  The nation’s  10-year yield  climbed the most in a week as
the New York-based rating company also referred to the nation’s
impaired financial system in its assessment released late
yesterday. Spanish  10-year bonds  dropped for a fourth day, the
longest run of declines in almost two months. Italy’s cost of
borrowing for one year rose as it sold 9.5 billion euros ($12.2
billion) of bills due in 367 and 160 days. Germany auctioned
two-year notes.  “It’s quite normal that when you get news like that it
puts immediate pressure on the market,” said Allan von Mehren,
chief analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen. “The rating
action reflects an overall picture, that things are still
looking weak.”  Italy ’s 10-year yield climbed four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 4.45 percent at 4:37 p.m. London time, the
biggest increase since July 3. The 4.5 percent bond maturing in
May 2023 dropped 0.275, or 2.75 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 100.8.  S&P cut Italy’s long-term credit rating to BBB, two levels
above junk, from BBB+. The outlook on the rating remains
negative, the company said in a statement.  Italy’s economic output in the first quarter of 2013 was 8
percent lower than in the final three months of 2007 and
continues to fall, S&P said. The company reduced its growth
forecast for 2013 to minus 1.9 percent, from minus 1.4 percent.  Spanish Bonds  Spain’s  10-year yield  jumped seven basis points to 4.81
percent, extending the run of price declines to the longest
since the period through May 14. S&P rates Spanish debt at BBB-,
the lowest investment grade level.  The S&P rating cut for Italy is “worse for Spain” as it
puts a spotlight on the country, said Marcus Ashworth, head of
fixed income at Espirito Santo Investment Bank in  London .  A Spanish government official who briefed journalists on
condition of anonymity said Spain isn’t aware of any pending
decision to downgrade the country’s credit rating.  Investors often disregard changes in ratings. Yields on
sovereign securities moved in the opposite direction from what
ratings suggested in 53 percent of 32 upgrades, downgrades and
changes in credit outlook last year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg published in December.  Italy Auction  Italy sold 7 billion euros of one-year bills at an average
yield of 1.078 percent, up from 0.962 percent when it last
auctioned 12-month debt on June 12. It also sold 2.5 billion
euros of 160-day securities at 0.599 percent.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Italian 10-year
bonds instead of similar-maturity German bunds widened four
basis points to 279 basis points. The spread has moved between
243 basis points and 361 basis points this year.  While the rating is “bad news,” markets are “in an
environment where investors are searching for yield and there’s
a lot of cash in the system, and Italy will continue to
benefit,” Danske Bank’s von Mehren said. The spread with
 Germany  may shrink to about 250 basis points this year, he said.  The benchmark 10-year bund was little changed at 1.65
percent after rising to 1.85 percent on June 24, the highest
level since April 2012.  Germany sold 4.1 billion euros of two-year notes at an
average yield of 0.07 percent, down from 0.18 percent when it
last auctioned the securities on June 12. They were sold at a
 record-low  of minus 0.06 percent in July 2012.  Volatility on Austrian bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Portugal and  Finland ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Italian bonds returned 2.6 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spanish
securities rose 5.5 percent, while German bunds fell 1.2
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
