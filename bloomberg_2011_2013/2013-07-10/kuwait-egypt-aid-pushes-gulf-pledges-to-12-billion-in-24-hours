Kuwait extended a $4 billion aid
package to  Egypt , adding to the $8 billion from Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates pledged yesterday.  Kuwait will deposit $2 billion with the Egyptian central
bank, give a $1 billion grant and offer $1 billion worth of oil
and oil products, state-run Kuna said in a text message today.
Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. pledged $5 billion and $3 billion
respectively yesterday.  Egypt’s reserves declined $1.1 billion in June to $14.9
billion, largely due to the annual re-evaluation of the
country’s gold holdings, according to central bank data.  Army generals ousted democratically elected President
Mohamed Mursi last week after people took the streets to protest
his policies and the nation’s ailing economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
