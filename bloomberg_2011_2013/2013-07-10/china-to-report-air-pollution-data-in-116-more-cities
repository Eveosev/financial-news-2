China  widened its air-quality
monitoring rules, asking more cities to report data as the
nation seeks to combat high levels of pollution.  A State Council  notice  told 116 more of its cities to
disclose air quality monitoring data, including readings for
pollutants such as PM2.5 and ozone, adding to 74 cities that
already do so. PM2.5 refers to fine air particles that pose
risks for lung and heart diseases.  The country will rank its major cities by the severity of
their air pollution, according to the statement, posted on the
State Council website yesterday and dated July 1.  The planned disclosures comes as a study by researchers
from the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  and  Peking
University  found that people in northern China may be dying five
years sooner than expected because of diseases caused by air
pollution, an unintended result of a decades-old policy
providing free coal for heat.  The study’s conclusion “is biased and not credible as
there were not a lot of samples,” Liu Zhiquan, the Ministry of
Environmental Protection’s deputy director of technology
standards, was citing as saying by China News Service in a
 report  on its website yesterday.  China plans also to increase the number of cities curbing
auto purchases to fight pollution and congestion, the
government-backed car association said yesterday.  Eight cities -- Chengdu, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Qingdao,
Shenzhen, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin and Wuhan -- will probably
introduce measures limiting auto purchases, Shi Jianhua, deputy
secretary general of the China Association of Automobile
Manufacturers, said at a briefing in Beijing, without being more
specific about the timing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
