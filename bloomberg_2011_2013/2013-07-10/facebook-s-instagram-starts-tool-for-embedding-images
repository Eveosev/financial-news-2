Facebook Inc. (FB)  is unveiling tools for
its Instagram service that will let users embed photos and
videos on outside websites, including blogs and news providers,
seeking to spread its influence and woo more consumers.  The new feature requires a few clicks of a mouse to place a
video or photo on a Web page, Facebook said in a blog  post 
today. The tool, designed to maintain privacy settings, is only
available for content that’s already public, the  Menlo Park ,
California-based company said.  The owner of the world’s most popular social-networking
service is rolling out new features for its  Instagram  unit to
help expand its reach on mobile devices where users are
increasingly shifting their activity. Facebook, competing
against services from Twitter Inc. and others, announced last
month it was adding video to its photo-sharing service.  “As always, you own your photos and videos, and we want to
make sure that’s understood no matter where your content
appears,” the company said. “Whether you want to embed your
video on your blog or a friend wants to feature your photo on a
website, everyone will clearly see that your content belongs to
you.”  Instagram, which Facebook bought last year for more than
$700 million, has more than 130 million monthly users. More than
16 billion photos have been shared on the service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
