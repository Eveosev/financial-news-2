Crude oil is trading at the highest price relative to gold in more than four years as a rebounding U.S. economy is increasing fuel demand while cutting the appeal of haven assets.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows one ounce of gold bought about 11.75 barrels of oil on July 5, the fewest since November 2008. The ratio reached 28.26 in February 2009, the highest since 1988, as the U.S. struggled to recover from the worst recession since the Great Depression. The measure has averaged 12.47 since 2000, and was near 11.92 today.  Through yesterday, crude futures traded in New York jumped 13 percent this year as American employers added more jobs and manufacturing gained. The U.S accounted for 21 percent of global demand last year, according to the International Energy Agency. Prices also climbed on concern that protests in  Egypt  will disrupt supplies from the Middle East. Gold tumbled 26 percent in that time as the Federal Reserve signaled it will scale back its stimulus program as the economy improves.  “Oil has real supply-and-demand dynamics, and there is a strong argument for prices holding up,” John Stephenson, who helps oversee about C$2.7 billion ($2.65 billion) at First Asset Investment Management Inc., said in a telephone interview from Toronto. “The U.S. clearly has turned the corner, and the tapering talk by the Fed has put gold out of favor.”  The U.S. Energy Information Administration raised its oil forecast for 2013. Prices will average $94.65 a barrel, up from a June projection of $93.25, the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, said yesterday. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on June 24 cut its gold-price target for the end of 2013 to $1,300 an ounce from $1,435.  Crude-oil futures for August delivery gained 1.6 percent to $105.14 at 9:59 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after touching $105.62, the highest since May 2012. Gold futures for August delivery rose 0.5 percent to $1,252.50 on the Comex in New York. Prices reached $1,179.40 on June 28, the lowest since August 2010.
