South Africa ’s meat traders lodged a
complaint with the antitrust regulator on proposals by a chicken
industry lobby to raise tariffs on birds shipped from overseas.  The petition against the South African Poultry Association
and local frozen-chicken companies was filed at the Competition
Commission, the Association of Meat Importers and Exporters said
in an e-mailed statement. The complaint relates to using duties
to halt competition, as well as price manipulation, it said.  The commission was scheduled to meet yesterday to decide on
directives to be sent to Trade and Industry Minister  Rob Davies .  The poultry group says imports of some cuts from Brazil and
 Europe  are hurting the local industry and may lead to as many as
20,000 job losses. The meat trading lobby says raising duties to
as much as 82 percent from 5 percent to 27 percent currently
would increase the cost of protein for local consumers.  “They are entitled to make their accusations,” Kevin Lovell, CEO of the poultry association, said today by mobile
phone. “The  competition commission  has investigated us before
and they found nothing of concern. I know for sure we do not
support any non-competitive measures in all our dealings.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
