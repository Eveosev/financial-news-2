U.S. stock futures rose as Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S. needs stimulative
monetary policy for the foreseeable future.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring in September
rose 0.7 percent to 1,656.4 at 5:25 p.m. in New York.  “Highly accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable
future is what’s needed in the  U.S. economy ,” Bernanke said
today in response to a question after a speech in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.  The benchmark index ended regular trading little changed as

warranted,” many officials want to see more signs employment is
picking up before they’ll begin slowing the pace of $85 billion
in monthly bond purchases.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
