Madagascar, the island nation off
southeast  Africa  where the main staple is rice, will receive a
grant to help support the agriculture industry and assure water
supplies.  The $6.3 million grant from the Global Environment Facility
Council to be channeled through the African Development Bank
backs climate-resilience efforts in agriculture in the southwest
region, the bank said. The project will improve water supply
infrastructure in the Bas Mangoky region, it said in a website
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
