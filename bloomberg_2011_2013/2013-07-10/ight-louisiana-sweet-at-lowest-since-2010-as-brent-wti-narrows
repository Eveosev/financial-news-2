Light Louisiana Sweet crude weakened
to a 30-month low against West Texas Intermediate as the U.S.
benchmark surged following a larger-than-expected decline in
supplies.  LLS, the light, sweet benchmark on the Gulf Coast, is
delivered by pipeline into terminals at St. James, Louisiana. It
and other Gulf of Mexico crudes compete with foreign oils priced
against the European benchmark Brent for space in U.S.
refineries.  Brent’s  premium  to WTI narrowed to less than $2 a barrel,
the lowest level based on settlement prices since November 2010,
after the Energy Department reported that crude inventories in
Cushing,  Oklahoma , dropped by 2.69 million barrels to 47
million. Cushing is the delivery point for WTI futures traded on
the  New York  Mercantile Exchange.  The spread narrowed from $23.18 a barrel on Feb. 8 as new
pipeline and rail projects diverted domestic oil from Cushing
while increasing takeaway capacity from the oil hub.  LLS weakened by $1.05 to $4.70 a barrel more than WTI at
4:30 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the
lowest premium since Dec. 1, 2010. Heavy Louisiana Sweet
weakened $1.25 to $4.05 above the U.S. benchmark.  Mars Blend weakened by $1.10 to a $1.05 discount to WTI,
the first time the medium-sour crude has traded below WTI since
Dec. 28, 2010. Poseidon weakened by $1.30 to a discount of $2 a
barrel.  Crude from the Southern Green Canyon weakened by 80 cents
to a $1.90-a-barrel discount to WTI. Thunder Horse weakened by
$1.70 to a $1.70-a-barrel premium to the U.S. benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
