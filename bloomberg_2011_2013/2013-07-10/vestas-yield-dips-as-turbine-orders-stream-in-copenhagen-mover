The yield on Vestas Wind System
A/S’s benchmark 2015 note fell to its lowest in Copenhagen
trading in seven weeks as investor confidence grows amid an
order uptick.  Vestas’ (VWS)  4.625 percent 600 million-euro ($769 million) bond
maturing in 2015 yielded 7.404 percent at 12:20 p.m. in the
capital, according to the Composite Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. That’s the lowest since the yield hit 7.352 on May 22.  Vestas has reported more than twice as many announced
 orders  since March than in the first quarter as the Latin
American market expands. Announced firm and unconditional orders
from the region jumped 87 percent in the second quarter for the
industry as a whole from the previous three months, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg Industries.  “Strong regional growth continues unabated” in the Latin
American wind market, James Evans, a Bloomberg Industries
analyst, wrote in a report. Vestas is among producers benefiting
from local manufacturing operations to win orders greater than
100 megawatts, he said.
