U.S.  Gulf Coast  diesel fuel
strengthened versus futures, rebounding from the  biggest
discount  in six weeks, after distillate inventories slumped amid
an increase in fixtures from the Gulf.  The discount for ultra-low-sulfur diesel on the Gulf Coast
narrowed 0.13 cent to  3.75 cents  a gallon below futures on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:03 p.m.  The differential narrowed after a U.S. Energy Information
Administration report showed stockpiles of distillate fuel on
the Gulf Coast, referred to as PADD 3, slumped  2.19 million
barrels  to 37.1 million, a  second consecutive  decline.  About 20 medium-range tankers carrying clean products were
loaded for exports from the Gulf Coast last week, up from 14 the
previous week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. As
product shipments increase to the Caribbean and other locations,
stockpiles tend to drop.  Inventories of gasoline  in the region fell 1.76 million to
76.1 million barrels, according to EIA data.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate oil in
Cushing,  Oklahoma , widened 34 cents to $15.62 a barrel. The same
spread for  Light Louisiana Sweet oil  gained $1.39 to $10.92.  To contact the reporter on this story:
