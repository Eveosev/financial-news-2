U.K. Firefighters are to be balloted
on strike action over government plans to curb the cost of
public-sector pensions, the Fire Brigades Union said today.  General Secretary Matt Wrack said today voting papers will
be sent out next week after the government imposed a July 12
deadline for the union to accept the changes or have them
imposed.  The FBU opposes proposals by Prime Minister David Cameron’s
coalition government to raise the state retirement age to 60
from 55, saying it is  not safe  for firefighters to work after
55. It also says its members will have to pay more and get
smaller pensions in return.  “Expecting large numbers of 60-year-olds to fight fires
and rescue families is dangerous to the public and to
firefighters,” Wrack said in an e-mailed statement. “The
government is simply ignoring the evidence about the physical
demands of firefighting and has been unable to answer our
concerns during two years of negotiations.”  Two thirds of firefighters fail to meet the fitness
standards for fighting fires after the age of 55, the union
said, citing a government review of the service. Firefighters
who are forced out of work or retire at 55 would lose half of
their pensions, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
