Treasuries erased losses after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  soothed concern that
policy makers are moving closer to ending asset purchases sooner
that most investors anticipated.  Yields (USGG10YR)  had climbed after minutes of the Fed’s June meeting
showed about half of officials indicated it would be would be
appropriate to end bond buying late this year. Speculation on
the timing of the eventual end of the Fed’s monthly buying of
$85 billion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed debt helped to
push yields on the government’s $21 billion in 10-year notes to
the highest since July 2011.  “Bernanke didn’t indicate tapering is happening sooner
than expected, which has brought the market somewhat off the
low,” said Larry Milstein, managing director in New York of
government-debt trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co. “It’s all
still a wait and see approach.”  The  yield  on the 10-year note was little changed at 2.63
percent at 5 p.m. in  New York , after rising to as high as 2.68
percent following the release of the minutes. The price of the
1.75 percent note maturing in May 2023 rose 2/32, or 63 cents
per $10,000 face value, to 92 14/32. The yield climbed to 2.75
percent on July 8, the highest level since August 2011.  Issue Re-Opening  In what’s known as a re-opening of the issue, the $21
billion in additional 10-year notes auctioned today were sold at
a high-yield of 2.67 percent, compared with a forecast of 2.68
percent in a Bloomberg News survey of 10 of the Fed’s 21 primary
dealers that are required to bid on the securities.  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , rose by 37.7 percent to
$338.6 billion, the highest level since July 5. The 2013 average
is $321.7 billion.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index ended at 98.98 at 4:02
p.m. in New York, above the one-year average of 64. It touched
117.89 on July 5, the highest since December 2010.  “Highly accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable
future is what’s needed in the  U.S. economy ,” Bernanke said
today in response to a question after a speech in Cambridge,
 Massachusetts .  In a discussion about the appropriate path of the balance
sheet among the 19 FOMC participants, “about half” indicated
“it likely would be appropriate to end asset purchases late
this year,” the minutes said. “Many other participants
anticipated that it likely would be appropriate to continue
purchases into 2014,” the minutes said, while “a few” wanted
to slow or stop the purchases at the June meeting.  Spooked Market  “About half said it could end this year -- that’s a
surprise,” said  David Ader , head of U.S. government-bond
strategy at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“That’s the part that has spooked the market.”  Bernanke said in a press conference after the June 18-19
meeting that the central bank may trim its bond-buying program
this year and halt it around mid-2014.  The minutes also said “several members judged that a
reduction in asset purchases would likely soon be warranted.”
Those members said the “cumulative decline in unemployment
since the September meeting and ongoing increases in private
payrolls” had increased their confidence that the labor market
had improved, the minutes showed.  Fed Rhetoric  “The Fed is going to taper at some point -- the buying is
going to stop at some point,” said Paul Montaquila, fixed-income investment officer with BNP Paribas SA’s Bank of the
West. “There was clearly a reaffirming of the non-committal
rhetoric we’ve heard for some time. I guess you can connect the
dots.”  The bid-to-cover ratio on the 10-year notes sold today,
which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, was 2.57, compared with 2.53 at the last
auction, the lowest since August 2012, and an average of 2.84
for the past 10 sales.  “The auction was a win for investors on a day where
trading has been very subdued and people are still waiting to
hear from the Fed,” said  Scott Graham , head of government-bond
trading in  Chicago  at  Bank of Montreal (BMO) ’s BMO Capital Markets
unit, a primary dealer. “These levels brought in some demand.”  Auction Metrics  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 38.6 percent of the notes, compared
with 51.7 at June’s auction, the highest since December 2011,
and an average of 36.9 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 16.3 percent of
the notes, compared with an average of 21.8 percent at the
previous 10 auctions.  Ten-year  U.S. debt  has lost 6.1 percent this year, compared
with a 3.1 percent drop in the broader Treasury market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The
benchmark notes returned 4.2 percent in 2012, compared with a
2.2 percent gain by Treasuries overall.  The auction is the second of three offerings this week as
the government  sells  $66 billion of notes and bonds. It
auctioned $32 billion of three-year securities yesterday at a
yield of 0.719 percent and is due to sell $13 billion of 30-year
debt tomorrow.  The sales will raise $5.6 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $60.4 billion, according to
the Treasury.  Investors have bid $2.94 for each dollar of the $1.13
trillion in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction so
far this year, according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
