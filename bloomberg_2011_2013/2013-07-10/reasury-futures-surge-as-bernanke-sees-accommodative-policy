Treasuries surged, pushing 10-year
futures contracts to the biggest gain in 15 months, after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  indicated the central
bank will maintain its efforts to keep borrowing costs low.  “Highly accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable
future is what’s needed in the  U.S. economy ,” Bernanke said
yesterday. Benchmark 10-year yields rose to the highest level in
almost two years earlier this week on speculation the Fed will
scale back the bond-buying program it uses to support the
economy. Minutes of the policy makers’ June meeting issued
yesterday showed they debated whether to reduce the purchases.
The U.S. is due to sell $13 billion of 30-year bonds today.  “The market is quite happy,” with Bernanke’s remarks,
said Chungkeun Oh, who invests in Treasuries at Industrial Bank
of  Korea  in  Seoul . “His comments should be quite a comfort.”  Ten-year futures contracts for September delivery rose
29/32, or $9.06 per $1,000 face amount, to 126 6/32 as of 10:09
a.m. in  Tokyo , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s set
for the biggest daily gain since April 6, 2012.  Benchmark 10-year  yields  declined four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 2.58 percent, Bloomberg Bond Trader
data showed. The price of the 1.75 percent note due in May 2023
rose 12/32 to 92 26/32. The yield climbed to 2.75 percent
earlier this week, the most since August 2011.  Bernanke told reporters on June 19 that the Fed may begin
to slow its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases this year and
end them in 2014.  Japan ’s 10-year yield slid two basis points to 0.835
percent, poised to decline for a third day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
