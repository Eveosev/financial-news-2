Brazil ’s swap rates dropped as a
report showing slower-than-forecast inflation damped speculation
that the central bank will step up the pace of increases in
borrowing costs today.  Swap rates due in January 2015 fell six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 9.52 percent at 11:21 a.m. in  Sao
Paulo . The real dropped 0.2 percent to 2.2641 per dollar.  Wholesale, construction and consumer prices rose 0.26
percent in the first preview for July of the Getulio Vargas
Foundation’s IGP-M index, published yesterday. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 0.5
percent increase.  Policy makers will increase the target lending rate by a
half-percentage point to 8.5 percent today, according to the
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The central bank has increased its benchmark twice this
year from a record low 7.25 percent, lifting it by a quarter-percentage point in April and an additional 50 basis points to 8
percent in May.  China ’s  exports and imports  unexpectedly declined in June,
underscoring the severity of the slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
