German government bonds opened
higher after a report showed consumer prices, calculated using a
harmonized European Union method, increased 1.9 percent in June
from a year earlier, matching analyst estimates.  The yield on the 10-year bund fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.63 percent at 7:04 a.m. London time,
declining for a third-straight day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
