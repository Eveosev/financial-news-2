London  police asked their Australian
counterparts to review whether any of the nation’s laws were
broken when a Sydney radio station made a prank phone call to
the U.K. hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was staying.  The  Metropolitan Police Service  sent a file yesterday to
the Australian Federal Police and New South Wales police
regarding the hoax call, the MPS said in a statement today. A
nurse at London’s King Edward VII’s Hospital, who took the call,
committed suicide shortly after the incident last December.  Radio hosts at  Southern Cross Media Group Ltd. (SXL) , Mel Greig
and Michael Christian, impersonated  Queen Elizabeth II  and
Prince Charles in the call seeking details about the health of
the former  Kate Middleton , the pregnant wife of Charles’s son
William, second in line to the British throne.  In February, prosecutors decided not to press charges
against Greig and Christian in the U.K. following an
investigation by the MPS.  “However misguided, the telephone call was intended as a
harmless prank,” Malcolm McHaffie, Crown Prosecution
Service deputy head of special crime, said at the time. “The
consequences in this case were very sad.”  The presenters never expected to be put through, according
to an interview broadcast Dec. 10 on Nine Entertainment Co.’s
“A Current Affair.”  “There’s not a minute that goes by where we don’t think
about her family and what they must be going through,” Greig
said, according to the transcript. “The thought we may have
played a part in that is gut wrenching.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
