Zack Wheeler allowed one run in
seven innings as the New York Mets completed a three-game series
sweep at the San Francisco Giants with a 7-2 win today.  Wheeler (3-1), making his first career start against San
Francisco, was traded by the Giants to the Mets two seasons ago
for  Carlos Beltran . He was a first-round draft pick of the
Giants, sixth overall, in 2009.  Wheeler, 23, also had a run-scoring double and scored a run
for the Mets (40-48), who have won four straight games. The
Giants (40-50) have lost four in a row.  Giants starting pitcher  Matt Cain  (5-6) lasted two-thirds
of an inning, allowing three runs on two hits and three walks.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
