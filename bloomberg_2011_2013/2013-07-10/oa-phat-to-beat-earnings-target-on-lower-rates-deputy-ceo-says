Hoa Phat Group,  Vietnam ’s biggest
steel producer by market value, will probably exceed its 2013
earnings forecast as borrowing costs fall, Deputy General
Director Nguyen Thi Thao Nguyen said.  The Hanoi-based company estimates net income in the first
half was as much as 75 percent of its full-year target, Nguyen
said in a telephone interview yesterday. Hoa Phat had predicted
profit of 1.2 trillion dong ($56.5 million) this year in a March
29 statement on its website. The average net income  estimate  of
five analysts tracked by Bloomberg is 1.43 trillion dong.  “We expect to beat earnings targets this year,” Nguyen
said. “It’s totally feasible.”  Vietnam’s central bank has cut its refinancing rate eight
times since March 2012 to spur economic growth. Gross domestic
product expanded 5.25 percent last year, the slowest pace since
at least 2005, according to revised figures from the General
Statistics Office. Hoa Phat shares have rallied 31 percent this
year, outpacing the 17 percent gain in the benchmark  VN Index. (VNINDEX)   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
