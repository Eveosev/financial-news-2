The value of assets in gold-backed
funds in  India , the world’s biggest consumer, fell for a third
month in June as a bear market in bullion deepened.  Holdings in exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, declined 9.2
percent to 96.1 billion rupees ($1.6 billion) as of June 30 from
a month earlier, the  Association of Mutual Funds in India  said
on its website, without giving data on volume. The value of
assets has lost 20 percent since reaching a record 120.6 billion
rupees in January, association data showed. Gold fell 4.5
percent in rupee terms in June, falling for a 10th month.  Global gold-backed exchange-traded products have fallen
below 2,000 metric tons for the first time since May 2010 after
bullion slumped on expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will
reduce stimulus measures. Gold in dollars slid 23 percent last
quarter, the biggest loss since at least 1920, as some investors
lost faith in the metal as a store of value on signs of an
improving U.S. economy.  “Indians are price sensitive, so they shy away from the
market in times of higher volatility,” Chirag Mehta, fund
manager at Quantum Asset Management Co., said by phone. “Demand
in the ETF market moves in line with demand in the physical
market and we should see buying coming in during the festival
season after the seasonally slack months of June and July.”  Reliance Suspension  Bullion futures in Mumbai slumped to 24,830 rupees per 10
grams on June 28, the lowest level since August 2011. The
contract for delivery in August was little changed at 26,028
rupees on the  Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd. (MCX)  at 11:30
a.m. local time, while spot gold in  London  was 0.4 percent lower
at $1,246.30 an ounce.  Reliance Capital Ltd. (RCAPT) , the financial services company owned
by Indian billionaire Anil Ambani, last month stopped sales of
gold and halted new subscriptions in its gold savings fund.
Jewelers and bullion dealers have halted sales of coins and bars
to retail investors to support government efforts to narrow the
record  current-account deficit .  India has increased import taxes and tightened financing
norms in a bid to cut gold purchases and contain the deficit.
Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram last month appealed to
Indians to “resist the temptation to buy gold,” saying reduced
imports may help tackle the current-account gap and the weakness
in the rupee. The currency touched a record low of 61.2125 per
dollar on July 8.  The current-account deficit, the broadest measure of trade,
tracking goods, services and investment income, widened to $87.8
billion, or 4.8 percent of the gross domestic product, from
$78.2 billion in 2011-2012, according to official data. The
deficit is the biggest risk to the $1.9 trillion economy,
according to the central bank.  Net redemptions from gold ETFs were 2.06 billion rupees in
June, according to data from the mutual funds’ association.
India, which allowed trading in gold ETFs in 2007, currently has
14 such funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
