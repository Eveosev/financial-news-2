The  National Basketball Association 
nudged the salary cap for next season to $58.7 million from $58
million per team as the moratorium on clubs signing free agents
expired at midnight.  The tax level also climbed, to $71.8 million from $70.3
million. The tax structure, which was $1 for every $1 over the
salary cap, is now graduated, starting at $1.50 for every $1 a
team salary exceeds the cap by as much as $4.99 million.  The minimum team salary, which is set at 90 percent of the
cap, is $52.8 million for the 2013-14 season.  Teams were cleared to begin signing players to contracts at
12:01 a.m.  New York  time. If a free agent signs with another
team, his current team has three days to make a counter-offer.  The collective bargaining agreement provides for three
different mid-level exceptions for signing players depending on
a teamâ€™s salary level.  If a team is over the cap and under the tax level, it can
use the non-taxpayer mid-level exemption of $5.15 million. If it
exceeds the tax limit, the team can use the taxpayer mid-level
exemption of $3.18 million. The mid-level exemption for a team
with room under the salary cap is $2.65 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
