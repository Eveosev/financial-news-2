Atacama Pacific Gold Corp. (ATM) , a
Toronto-based gold explorer operating in Chile, agreed to buy
2.5 million cubic meters (88 million cubic feet) a year of
treated industrial water from the Aguas Chanar SA utility for
use at its Cerro Maricunga project.  Atacama Pacific agreed to pay $574,000 a year, or the
equivalent of 22.5 cents per cubic meter, before the project
starts and 75 cents a cubic meter when it goes online, according
to a statement distributed by Market News Publishing. The
contract is for 13 years of water from Chanarâ€™s plant in
Copiapo, Chile, and can be renewed for another five years,
Atacama Pacific said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
