New Zealand ’s economy is gaining
momentum as consumer and business confidence improves and wages
increase, Finance Minister  Bill English  said.  “A number of recent indicators confirm the economy is on
the right track and the future is looking brighter,” English
said in a speech in Wellington today. “We are seeing momentum
building towards a stronger, more stable economy.”  Business optimism neared a four-year high in the second
quarter, with firms saying they were more likely to invest and
hire workers, according to a New Zealand Institute of Economic
Research Inc. survey published yesterday. The central bank has
kept  interest rates  at a record low since March 2011 to help
speed the recovery.  “We are on track for 2 to 3 percent annual growth over the
next few years,” English said. “ Interest rates  are around 50-year lows and the cost of living is well under control.”  The government’s strategy is to reduce the debt that was
accumulated to help the nation come through the global financial
crisis and recover from earthquakes in Christchurch, he said. At
the same time, it wants to rebuild the economy’s capacity to
deliver more jobs and higher incomes, he said.  “We all understand there is no economic wave coming to
pick us up,” English said. “We have to get paddling
ourselves.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
