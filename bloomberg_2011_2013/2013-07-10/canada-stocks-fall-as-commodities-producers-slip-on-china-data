Canadian  stocks  fell for the first
time in three days as utilities declined and raw-materials
producers slipped amid data showing China’s trade unexpectedly
retreated last month.  BlackBerry Ltd. dropped 3 percent, leading technology
shares lower, after announcing late yesterday its vice-president
of U.S. sales had left. Fortis Inc. slumped 1.5 percent as
utility stocks declined for a second day. Turquoise Hill
Resources Ltd. and Fortuna Silver Mines Inc. slid more than 2.1
percent even as commodity prices extended a rally.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 21.81
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,275.28 at 10:12 a.m. in Toronto.
The gauge has lost 1.3 percent this year.  China’s imports and exports retreated in June, raising
concerns that  Canada ’s second-largest trading partner faces
slowing economic growth. Overseas shipments slid 3.1 percent
from a year earlier, compared with the median estimate of a 3.7
percent gain. Imports dropped 0.7 percent, short of the median 6
percent increase according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
