A bill to boost bank lending in
 Mexico  would have an immediate impact on the economy, helping to
boost growth as soon as next year, Deputy Finance Minister
Fernando Aportela said.  The bill encourages development banks to work more closely
with the financial industry to lift lending, which reached only
26 percent of gross domestic product last year, Aportela said
today at the Bloomberg Mexico Conference in  New York . Aportela
said he expects the reform bill, which was presented in May, to
be debated in special congressional sessions in August.  Mexico’s commercial bank lending as a percentage of GDP is
the lowest among Latin American nations, according to the most
recent data from the  International Monetary Fund . President
Enrique Pena Nieto’s reform proposals, which also include
measures targeting the energy industry and taxes, would lift
growth by at least one percentage point, Aportela said.  “We’re trying to have in our package elements to
accelerate” the impact on the economy, Aportela said. “We’re
expecting to feel the effects of the financial reform, if we get
approval by Congress, during 2014.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
