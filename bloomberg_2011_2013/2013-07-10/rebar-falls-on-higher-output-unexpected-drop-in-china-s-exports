Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  fell for the third day amid increased output from mills
and after an unexpected drop in  China ’s exports.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 0.5 percent to 3,579 yuan ($584) a
metric ton before trading at 3,588 yuan at 10:45 a.m. local
time.  China’s exports and imports both unexpectedly declined in
June in a sign of weakness in global and domestic demand. The
nation’s daily crude steel output in late June rose from the
middle of the month, Custeel.com analyst Hu Yanping said on July
8, citing data from the China Iron and Steel Association.  “More data is confirming the trend of a slowdown in
economic growth in the second quarter, which may pressure the
rebar market,” Wang Yongliang, an analyst at Beijing CIFCO
Futures Co., said from Tianjin today.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port rose 1.5
percent to $123.70 a dry ton yesterday, according to The Steel
Index Ltd. The average  spot  price for rebar in China was little
changed at 3,407  yuan  a ton yesterday, according to data from
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
