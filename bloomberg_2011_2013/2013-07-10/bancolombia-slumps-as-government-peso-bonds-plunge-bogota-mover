Bancolombia SA (BCOLO)  fell to an 11-month
low on concern its investment in government peso debt will hurt
earnings after the bonds posted the worst quarterly decline in
five years.  The Medellin-based lender’s  shares  slid 1.7 percent to
25,000 pesos at 1:52 p.m. in Bogota, the lowest on a closing
basis since August 2012. The Colcap index declined 1.4 percent.  Yields on 10-year government peso bonds jumped 2.01
percentage points in the second quarter, the biggest increase
since 2008. Debt securities represented 13 percent of assets at
 Colombia ’s biggest bank at the end of the first quarter,
according to the lender’s report in May.  “People are trying to anticipate earnings,”Katherine Ortiz, an analyst at Corredores Asociados brokerage in Bogota,
said in a telephone interview. “June was a very difficult month
for fixed income, and there’s concern about how that will show
up.”  Bancolombia said in an e-mailed response to questions that
the selloff in government debt hurt earnings in the second
quarter.  “Apart from that, the bank is doing very well and growth,
loan quality, capital levels and funding costs are going
according to our business plan,” the bank said.  Bancolombia said in the May regulatory filing that income
from investments in the first quarter doubled from a year
earlier to 348 billion pesos ($181 million), buoyed by
appreciation in Colombian  government securities . Those gains
helped the bank post an 11 percent  increase  in net income to
492.7 billion pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
