China ’s copper  imports  climbed to a
nine-month high in June as traders took advantage of lower
prices in  London  than  Shanghai .  Arrivals of the refined metal, alloy and products were
379,951 metric tons last month, the General Administration of
Customs said on its website today. That was the highest since
September, and 5.9 percent higher from May, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Prices in Shanghai were about $73 a ton higher than in
London on average in June, based on calculations by Bloomberg to
account for currencies, shipping, tax and warehousing. Money-market rates in China surged in late June, which also encouraged
imports for use as collateral to get credit.  “There should still be a lot of financing deals, plus good
arbitrage opportunities,” Xu Liping, an analyst at HNA Topwin
Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai. “But there is also
still concern about real demand, given weak macro economic
data.”  Copper for delivery in November on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 1.5 percent to 48,170  yuan  ($7,851) a ton at 12:30
p.m. local time, while the three-month contract on the LME was
at $6,700. That left arbitrage trade unattractive today to the
tune of about $23.  The nation’s total exports and imports both unexpectedly
declined in June, with overseas shipments dropping for the first
time since January 2012.  Copper  output  in China, the biggest producer of the refined
metal, climbed to a record 567,892 tons in May, according to
data from Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  Imports of  scrap copper  were 340,000 tons in June, down
from 360,000 tons in May, today’s customs data showed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
