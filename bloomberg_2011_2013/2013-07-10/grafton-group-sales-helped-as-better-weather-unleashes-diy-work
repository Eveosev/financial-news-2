Grafton Group Plc (GN5) , owner of the
Woodie’s home-improvement chain in Ireland, said a flurry of
construction work in May and June helped sustain first-half
sales against a prolonged winter.  Revenue was little changed at 1.1 billion euros ($1.4
billion), the Dublin-based builders’ supplier said in a release
today. Business at the U.K. merchanting division gained 1.7
percent, though the pound to euro exchange rate sapped 26
million euros from sales, it said.  “Trading in the half year was affected by adverse weather
conditions in the first quarter and a recovery in activity
levels in the second quarter,” the company said in a statement.  Grafton’s pick up in sales in the second quarter bolsters
hopes of an emerging recovery in the British building industry.
The Irish company’s retail arm Selco added stores in Wimbledon
and Old Kent Road, tapping London’s more robust construction
market.  SIG Group Plc, a U.K. distributor of insulation to
builders, and  Bovis Homes Group Plc (BVS)  posted growth in sales.  Separately, Grafton said it has appointed  David Arnold  as
chief financial officer, replacing Colm O’Nuallain who is
retiring.  Grafton fell 0.9 percent to 5.55 euros in Dublin trading.
First-half revenue was in line with an estimate derived from
analysts’ predictions collated by Bloomberg.  Travis Perkins Plc (TPK) ,
which owns the Wickes home-improvment chain, fell 0.4 percent in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
