Ceragon Networks Ltd. (CRNT) , a maker of
systems for mobile-phone and Internet providers, rose the most
in a month in New York after reporting orders of $3.5 million
that tempered investors’ concern about a revenue drop.  The shares climbed 2.3 percent to $3.11 yesterday, the most
since June 7, to trade 0.3 percent above the stock listed in  Tel
Aviv . The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index gained a second day,
led by Caesarstone Sdot Yam Ltd., a maker of quartz countertops.
 ClickSoftware (CKSW)  Technologies Ltd., whose second-biggest investor
is  George Soros ’s Soros Fund Management LLC, extended a three-day plunge to 15 percent.  Ceragon, which got 16 percent of sales from the Asia-Pacific region last year, said yesterday that a “large” mobile
operator in the region placed the orders. Ceragon is still down
20 percent since April 8, when Chief Executive Officer Ira Palti
cut revenue forecasts. The company has reported losses for nine
consecutive quarters and is projected to post the  biggest
decline  in annual sales in more than a decade, according to the
average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The new order “shows some momentum,”  Joseph Wolf , an
analyst at Barclays Plc, who rates the stock the equivalent of
hold, said in a telephone interview from Tel Aviv yesterday.
“But it’s not an inflection point in the weak demand
environment that’s an overhang on Ceragon’s growth rate. It’s a
good company with a very tough end market.”  The Bloomberg Israel-US gauge rose 0.7 percent to 92.15,
the highest price since June 18. The benchmark  TA-25 Index (TA-25) 
advanced for the first time in three days, adding 0.7 percent to
1,214.69 at 10:24 a.m. in Tel Aviv.  Ceragon’s Tel Aviv shares this morning slipped 0.8 percent
to 11.19 shekels, or $3.09, in volume of 4 percent of the three-month daily average.  Caesarstone (CSTE)  jumped 6 percent to $29.10, the highest price
since May 30. The shares have rallied 82 percent in 2013.  ClickSoftware, an Israeli software developer, declined 4.4
percent to $7.11, the lowest price since April 23. Earlier this
week, the Petach Tikva, Israel-based company reported profit and
revenue that trailed analysts’ projections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
