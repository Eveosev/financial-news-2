Detroit Lions quarterback  Matthew Stafford  signed a three-year extension that keeps him under
contract through the 2017 National Football League season.  “Happy to be in Detroit for at least 5 more” years,
Stafford, who was the No. 1 pick in the 2009 draft, said on his
 Twitter feed . “Love this team and city!”  The Lions didn’t disclose financial terms of the contract,
which the  Detroit News said  will pay Stafford $76 million over
the next five years. The deal includes $43 million in guaranteed
money, the newspaper said, citing an unidentified person with
knowledge of the situation.  Stafford, 25, has started every game the past two seasons
after being limited to 13 games his first two years by knee and
shoulder injuries.  Stafford led the Lions to the playoffs in 2011, when he
threw for 41 touchdowns and 5,038 yards, joining  Tom Brady , Drew Brees and  Dan Marino  as the only quarterbacks in NFL history to
pass for more than 5,000 yards in a season. Stafford passed for
4,967 yards, 20 touchdowns and 17 interceptions last season as
Detroit slumped to 4-12. He’s led the NFL in pass attempts each
of the past two seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
