Developers will spend more than $134
billion annually by 2020 on solar-energy systems, up 51 percent
from this year, as falling panel prices make electricity
produced from sunlight cost-competitive with power from other
sources, according to a report from  Navigant Consulting Inc. (NCI)   Growing demand for photovoltaic systems in  emerging markets 
including Chile, South Africa and Saudi Arabia will be bolstered
in other regions by increased use of both large, utility-scale
power plants and smaller, distributed generation systems, the
Chicago-based company said in an e-mailed statement today.  “By the end of 2020, solar PV is expected to be cost-competitive with retail electricity prices, without subsidies,
in a significant portion of the world,” Dexter Gauntlett, a
Navigant analyst, said in the statement.  The company expects a total of 438 gigawatts of solar
capacity to be installed from this year through 2020.  By 2017, the year after some U.S. tax incentives are cut,
solar power will achieve grid parity “in most major markets,”
according to the  report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
