Four provincial cities in Sierra
Leone won a $61 million water-supply loan from the  African
Development Bank , eNews Channel Africa reported, citing state
Sierra Leone Water Co. regional station manager Alimany Kamara.  The loan for the water and sanitation upgrades will help
reduce residentsâ€™ dependence on well waters and polluted
streams, the report said, citing Kamara, and follows a cholera
outbreak last year in which more than 300 people died.  To contact the reporter on this story:
