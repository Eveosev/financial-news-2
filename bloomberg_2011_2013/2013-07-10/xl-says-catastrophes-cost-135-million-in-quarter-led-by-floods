XL Group Plc (XL)  said natural disasters
cost the insurer about $135 million before taxes last quarter,
led by flooding in Europe, Argentina and Canada and hail and
tornadoes in the U.S.  About 55 percent is from insurance segments, with the rest
from reinsurance, the Dublin-based company said today in a
statement distributed by PR Newswire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
