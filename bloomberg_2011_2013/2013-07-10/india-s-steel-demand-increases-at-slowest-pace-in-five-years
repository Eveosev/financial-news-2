Steel consumption in  India , the
world’s third-largest user of the alloy, increased in the last
quarter at the slowest pace in at least five years as demand for
automobiles waned amid an economic slowdown.  Demand rose 0.2 percent to 17.8 million metric tons in the
three months ended June 30 from a year earlier, according to
initial data from the steel ministry. Production climbed 3.9
percent to 19.7 million tons, widening a glut.  India’s economy  expanded less than 5 percent for a second
straight quarter as investments slowed, according to a May 31
government report. Sales at  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the
nation’s biggest automaker by volume, fell each month this year
compared with the same period last year.  Steel demand rose 3.3 percent in the year ended March 31,
less than half the government’s 8 percent estimate.  Fitch Ratings’ India unit cut the outlook on local
steelmakers to negative from stable for the second half of 2013,
according to e-mailed statement today. The downgrade followed
muted demand for the alloy and the limited ability of producers
to raise prices, it said.  Lower domestic consumption has prompted steelmakers to seek
overseas markets, pushing up alloy exports by 13 percent to 1.12
million tons, while imports dropped 34 percent to 1.32 million
tons, according to the ministry’s data.  Steelmakers in India are poised to boost exports to a
record as a plunge in the rupee increases the value of sales
overseas. Exports will climb 30 percent to 6.8 million tons this
fiscal year, according to the average estimate of 10 analysts,
government officials and company executives in a Bloomberg
survey last month.  Shares of  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , India’s biggest producer, fell
2.1 percent to 256.20 rupees at the close in Mumbai, while  Steel
Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) , the second-largest producer, declined
0.5 percent to 47.70 rupees.  JSW Steel Ltd. (JSTL) , the third-largest
producer, lost 2.4 percent to 594.10 rupees. The benchmark S&P
BSE Sensex fell 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
