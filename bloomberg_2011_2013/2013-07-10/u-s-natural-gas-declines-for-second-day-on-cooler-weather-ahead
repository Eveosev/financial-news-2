Natural gas climbed in New York for
the second time in three days amid forecasts for above-normal
temperatures that would boost air conditioner use.  Gas gained 0.6 percent as MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said temperatures would be higher than
average in most of the lower-48 states from July 15 through July
24. The high in  Chicago  on July 20 may be 90 degrees Fahrenheit
(32 Celsius), 6 higher than usual, according to  AccuWeather Inc. 
in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  “Some of the private forecasters are calling for a heat
dome to come into the Midwest,” said  Phil Flynn , a senior
market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “We could see
an extended period of hot and dry weather across the country
that would boost power demand.”  Natural gas for August delivery rose 2.3 cents to settle at
$3.68 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 31 percent below the
100-day average at 2:44 p.m. Prices have climbed 9.8 percent
this year.  The discount of August to October futures was unchanged at
1.7 cents.  August $3.60 puts were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 0.6 cent lower at 6.2 cents per
million Btu on volume of 522 at 2:57 p.m. Puts accounted for 50
percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for at-the-money
options expiring in August was 30.38 percent at 2:45 p.m.,
compared with 30.83 percent yesterday.  Hot Weather  The high in  New York  on July 20 may be 95 degrees, 11 more
than usual, AccuWeather data show.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas
demand, according to the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm.  An EIA report scheduled for release tomorrow may show gas
stockpiles rose 81 billion cubic feet in the week ended July 5,
according to the median of 13 analyst  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. The five-year average change for the week is a gain
of 74 billion, agency data show. Supplies climbed by 34 billion
in the same period last year.  Gas inventories totaled 2.605 trillion cubic feet in the
seven days ended June 28, the EIA said July 3. Supplies were 1.1
percent below the five-year average and 15.9 percent below year-earlier stockpiles.  Gas Production  Natural gas producers increased their hedges this year at
the most aggressive pace in three years to take advantage of a
spring price rally, though it’s unlikely this will cause an
uptick in gas-directed drilling, Biliana Pehlivanova, an analyst
with Barclays in New York, said in a note to clients today.  U.S. gas production growth may “tip into declines” in the
second half of 2013, Pehlivanova said.  The U.S. cut its 2013 natural gas production estimate to
69.96 billion cubic feet a day from last month’s forecast of
70.01 billion, according to the EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook,
released yesterday. Output may still rise 1.1 percent from 2012
to a record as onshore supplies climb.  Stockpiles may rise to 3.809 trillion cubic feet at the end
of October, about 120 billion below last year’s peak, the EIA
said in the report.  The number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the U.S.
rose by two to 355 last week, according to data released July 3
by Baker Hughes Inc. in Houston. The gas rig total is down 18
percent this year.  The U.S. met 89 percent of its own energy needs in March,
the highest monthly rate since April 1986, EIA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
