Russia , projected to be among this
season’s five biggest  wheat exporters , will ship the highest
monthly grain amount so far this year from Novorossiysk port in
July as the harvest progresses, SovEcon  said .  Traders will export more than 440,000 metric tons of grain
this month from the Black Sea port, the highest amount handled
this year, Moscow-based agricultural researcher SovEcon said on
its website today. Shipments will include 210,200 tons of wheat
and 233,400 tons of barley, SovEcon data show.  Russia’s grain exports are speeding up as harvesting
progresses and the crop rebounds from last year’s drought.
Farmers harvested 11 percent of the target area under grains as
of July 9 and gathered 16.7 million tons, according to the
Agriculture Ministry. The crop should rebound 34 percent to 95
million tons this year.  The new crop is being shipped now because the old crop
stocks have been sold for exports, SovEcon said.  Russia will ship 17 million tons of wheat in 2013-14 that
started July 1, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  estimates
show, tying with  Australia  and ranking behind the U.S.,  Canada 
and the European Union. That would exceed the prior period’s 11
million tons, according to the USDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
