Avaya Holdings Corp. (AVYA) , the
telecommunications-equipment maker owned by private-equity
firms, has appointed Pierre-Paul Allard, an executive hired from
 Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  last year, as its new head of global sales.  Allard, who spent 19 years at the computer-networking
company before joining Avaya, becomes senior vice president in
charge of worldwide sales and president of field operations
effective immediately, according to a staff memo by Avaya Chief
Executive Officer Kevin Kennedy that was obtained by Bloomberg
News. The company will disclose the management changes in a
regulatory filing tomorrow, according to Mike Moeller, a
spokesman for Avaya who confirmed the memo’s content.  Avaya, which traces its  roots  to AT&T Inc.’s onetime Lucent
Technologies unit, sells  telephone , computer networking, and
wireless communications gear to businesses. The Santa Clara,
California-based company -- owned by Silver Lake Management LLC
and TPG Capital -- filed an amended  prospectus  on May 31 with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in anticipation of
an initial public offering. It had previously delayed a planned
IPO.  Allard “maintains a strong network of colleagues and
contacts around the world” and has had a “profound impact” on
restructuring the company’s marketing, Kennedy said in the memo.  Tom Mitchell, Avaya’s current head of sales, will leave the
company in September. Allard was president of Cisco’s Canadian
division from 1993 to 2003, then held a series of vice president
titles there, according to his  LinkedIn profile .  To contact the reporters on this story:
