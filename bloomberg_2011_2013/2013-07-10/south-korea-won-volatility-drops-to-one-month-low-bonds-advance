A measure of swings in  South Korea ’s
won fell to a one-month low, extending yesterday’s decline that
was the biggest in more than five months, as concerns about a
tapering of U.S. stimulus measures waned.  Government bonds 
gained for a second day.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 9.64 percent, the lowest
level since June 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
declined 115 basis points yesterday, the most since Jan. 29.  The gauge has slid since touching an 18-month high of 13.39
percent on June 25, triggered by concern that Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will rein in stimulus that has fueled
demand for emerging-market assets. South Korea’s exports
exceeded imports by $5.52 billion last month, near the biggest
surplus since October 2010, data showed last week. June’s
unemployment rate was 3.2 percent, unchanged from May and
matching the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey, official
data showed today.  “Volatility going down means a decrease in uncertainties,
and it could be lifting sentiment on the won,” said Hwang Sun
Min, a currency dealer at Kookmin Bank in Seoul. “I wouldn’t
say uncertainties regarding Fed’s stimulus exit strategy are
gone. Investors are waiting for Bernanke’s comments later today
to get a better picture.”  Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering won a 481.2
billion won ($423 million) order for three  container ships ,
according to a regulatory filing yesterday. Bernanke speaks
today on economic policy and minutes will be released of the
 Federal Open Market Committee ’s June 18-19 meeting, after which
the chairman said the Fed may begin to slow its $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases this year.  The won rose for a second day, climbing 0.3 percent to
1,138.56 versus the dollar at 10:47 a.m. in Seoul, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It jumped 0.9 percent yesterday, the
biggest gain since Feb. 4.  The yield on the 2.75 percent government notes due March
2018 fell two basis points to 3.28 percent, prices from Korea
Exchange Inc. show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
