Hong Kong  stocks  rose, with the
city’s benchmark index heading for a second day of advance,
ahead of China trade data. Gains were limited after the
International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecast.  The Hang Seng Index rose 0.7 percent to 20,827.23 as of
9:32 a.m. in Hong Kong, with just three shares falling on the
50-member gauge. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
mainland companies gained 1 percent to 9,144.25.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, also known as the H-share index, closed 26 percent below its Feb. 1 high yesterday,
with a 20 percent drop meeting some investors’ definition of a
bear market. The measure  traded  at 1.09 times the value of net
assets, near levels not seen since the depths of the 2008 global
financial crisis.  Shares on the benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  traded at 9.8 times
 estimated earnings  yesterday, 15 percent below the three-year
average. That compares with 15 times for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and a multiple of 13 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the S&P 500 Index gained 0.1 percent today. The
equity gauge gained 0.7 percent yesterday in New York as U.S.
stocks rose a fourth day on optimism companies will report
better-than-forecast earnings and that economic growth is strong
enough to withstand tapering of Federal Reserve stimulus.  Resources and energy companies  lead declines this year on
the Hang Seng Composite Index, the city’s broadest equity
measure. The gauge fell 9.4 percent from the end of December,
with information technology and utilities the only sectors to
gain among 11 industry groups.  To contact the reporter on this story:
