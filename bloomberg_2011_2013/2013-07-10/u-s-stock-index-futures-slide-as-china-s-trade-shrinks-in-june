U.S. stock-index futures fell,
indicating equities may snap a four-day rally, as  China ’s
exports and imports unexpectedly dropped.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September lost 0.2 percent to 1,641.6 at 9:52 a.m. in London.
Contracts on the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  slid 22 points, or
0.1 percent, to 15,200.  A report from the General Administration of Customs in
Beijing showed that China’s exports fell 3.1 percent in June
from a year earlier. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
had called for a 3.7 percent gain. Imports dropped 0.7 percent
last month, compared with the median projection of a 6 percent
increase.  In the U.S., the Federal Reserve releases the minutes of
its June meeting at 2 p.m. New York time today. Speaking after
that meeting, Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank may
reduce the pace of its $85 billion in monthly bond buying later
in 2013, and may halt purchases around mid-2014 if the  U.S.
economy  performs as the Fed forecasts.  U.S. stocks rose for a fourth day amid optimism companies
will report better-than-forecast earnings and that economic
growth is strong enough to withstand any reduction in Federal
Reserve stimulus.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
