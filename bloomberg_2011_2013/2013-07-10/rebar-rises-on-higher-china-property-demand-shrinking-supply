Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  rebounded from a two-day slide on the prospect that
rising land sales will boost construction of homes amid
shrinking supply of the building material.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 1.1 percent to close at 3,638 yuan ($593) a metric
ton, paring this year’s decline to 8.8 percent.  Proceeds from land sales in 306 cities in the first half
jumped 60 percent from a year ago to 1.13 trillion yuan,
brokerage Zhongyuan Futures Co. said in a research report today.
China’s total rebar  inventory  on July 5 dropped to 7.3 million
tons, the lowest since Feb. 8, according to Shanghai Steelhome
Information Technology Co.  “The property sector has outperformed expectations, and
more land sales are bullish for rebar’s demand,” Shang Jinyu,
an analyst at Zhongyuan Futures Co., said from Zhengzhou. “The
fundamentals for rebar are looking more positive,” he said.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port rose 1.5
percent to $123.70 a dry ton yesterday, according to The Steel
Index Ltd.  The average  spot  price for rebar in China fell 0.2 percent
to 3,406  yuan  a ton according to data from Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
