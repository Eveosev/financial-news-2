De Beers , the biggest diamond
producer, will introduce forward sales contracts for buyers in
its rough-diamond auctions.  De Beers, owned by  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , is moving the
purchasing, production and sales base for its diamond auctions
to  Singapore  in November, the company said yesterday in a
statement posted on its  website .  The forward sales will allow customers to determine the
volume of goods they want to purchase over a given period, De
Beers said. The company will continue to hold spot auction
events, it said.  About 10 percent of the companyâ€™s rough diamonds are sold
through its auction platform, De Beers said. The auction product
range includes special and exceptional stones and differs from
diamond boxes the company sells to prequalified buyers, or
sightholders, at sales events known as sights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
