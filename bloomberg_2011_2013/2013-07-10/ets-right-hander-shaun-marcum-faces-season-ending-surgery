New York  Mets right-hander Shaun Marcum faces season-ending surgery on a blocked artery that is
impeding blood flow to his hand, Assistant General Manager John Ricco said.  Marcum was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome after he
complained of tingling and numbness in his right hand. He will
have surgery July 15.  “It involves an artery that’s blocking circulation,”
Ricco said on the team’s website. “They go in and do a
procedure that frees up the blood flow.”  Ricco said Marcum, who is 1-10 with a 5.29 earned-run
average, may be ready to throw again in early September.  “I don’t think there would be enough time for him to get
back to the big leagues,” Ricco said.  Right-handed reliever Gonzalez Germen from Triple-A  Las
Vegas  was activated for last night’s game against the  San
Francisco Giants , taking Marcum’s roster spot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
