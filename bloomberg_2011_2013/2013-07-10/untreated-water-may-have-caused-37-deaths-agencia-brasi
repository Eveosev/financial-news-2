Contaminated water carried by trucks
in  Brazil ’s northeastern state of Alagoas meant to help combat a
drought may have led to 37 diarrhea-related deaths, Agencia
Brasil said, citing the Health Ministry.  The people who died from May 19 to June 30 may have drank
untreated water distributed by the vehicles, the news service
reported, citing a Health Ministry note distributed during a
lower-house hearing.  The trucks were providing drinking water to boost supplies
to 77 cities in Alagoas state enduring the region’s worst
drought in decades, according to the July 4 report.  Link to article (Portuguese):
