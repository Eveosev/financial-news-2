Coffee exports from Uganda,  Africa ’s
biggest robusta shipper, rose for a sixth month in June after a
larger crop.  Shipments climbed 31 percent to 361,146 bags from 275,057
bags in June last year, the state-run Uganda Coffee Development
Authority said. Output in 2012-13 will be 3.35 million bags, 8.9
percent larger than a year earlier, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. A bag weighs 132 pounds.  “Plantings in the last few years and the good rains last
year contributed to a bigger crop,” said Joseph Nkandu,
executive director of the Kampala-based National Union of Coffee
Agribusiness and Farm Enterprises.  Uganda mainly ships beans to the European Union, the U.S.,
Sudan, Switzerland, India, Singapore and  Russia . Robusta
accounts for about 79 percent of the crop.  Coffee exports in the first nine months of the 2012-13
season climbed 31 percent to 2.64 million bags from 2.01 million
bags a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
