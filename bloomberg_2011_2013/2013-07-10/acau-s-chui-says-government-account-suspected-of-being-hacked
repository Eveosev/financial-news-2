The Macau government said its e-mail
account at  Citic Telecom International Holdings Ltd. (1883)  was among
those suspected of being hacked, amid heightened concern about
cyber-attacks.  The police and the city’s telecommunications regulator are
investigating, Macau’s Chief Executive Fernando Chui said,
according to a government statement today.  Cia. de Telecomunicacoes de Macau SARL, a unit of Citic
Telecom, said 34 Internet customers were affected by suspected
illegal cyber activity, according to a  statement  on the
company’s website dated yesterday. There was no indication of
loss of information or risk to customers’ personal data, it
said.  Cybersecurity is one of issues to be discussed this week at
the China-U.S. Strategic and Economic Dialogue to be held in
 Washington . Former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden disclosed the U.S. had hacked computers in  Hong Kong  and
 China  since 2009.  The Macau police identified the IP addresses of the
attackers are from Hong Kong and the U.S., according a statement
on the Judiciary Police’s website dated July 8.  Chui expressed his concerns over the recent hacking reports
to Stephen Young, the U.S. Consul General to Hong Kong and
Macau, in an earlier meeting, according to today’s statement
from the government.  Citic Telecom’s Hong Kong unit said last month its website
was hacked. About 2,500 ComNet Telecom (HK) Ltd. customers’
information may have been leaked and the company tightened
security measures after the attack, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
