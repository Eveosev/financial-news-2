Treasury 10-year notes fell for the
first time in three days with the U.S. set to sell $21 billion
of the securities an hour before minutes of the  Federal
Reserve ’s last policy meeting are scheduled to be released.  Yields on the benchmark securities were at almost the
highest level since 2011 relative to two- and 30-year debt,
reflecting reduced demand for 10-year notes versus the other
two. Bonds extended losses after inventories at U.S. wholesalers
unexpectedly dropped as sales surged. Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  is scheduled to speak on economic policy after
the central bank releases the minutes of its June meeting.  “The economy is going to get better and that will mean
higher rates,” said  Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in  New
York  at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc. The wholesale report
was “another bullish sign for the economy. Now inventories are
going down and sales are jumping. It means they are going to
build inventories going forward.”  The benchmark 10-year  yield  rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 2.66 percent at 12:01 p.m. in New
York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the
1.75 percent note maturing in May 2023 fell 9/32, or $2.81 per
$10,000 face value, to 92 3/32. The yield climbed to 2.75
percent on July 8, the highest level since August 2011.  Treasuries handed investors a loss of 3.4 percent this year
through yesterday, Bloomberg World Bond Indexes show.  Cheapest Level  The  butterfly spread , which measures differences between
the yields of the three maturities of debt, was 1.25 percentage
points after increasing to 1.39 percentage points last week, the
most since July 2011.  Treasuries due in a decade or more are at almost the
cheapest level in more than two years relative to global peers
with comparable maturities, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes. Yields on  U.S. debt  were 82 basis points higher
than those in an index of other sovereign debt on July 9. The
yields were 85 basis points higher on July 5, the most since
March 2011.  Treasuries extended losses earlier after a 0.5 percent
decrease in wholesalers  stockpiles  that was the biggest since
September 2011 and which followed a 0.1 percent drop in April
that was initially reported as a gain, the Commerce Department
said in  Washington . The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey
called for a 0.3 percent increase. Sales jumped 1.6 percent, the
most since November.  Direction ‘Uncertainty’  “We’ve been trading along these low 2.6 percent levels --
there’s a little bit of uncertainty to the direction, given the
10-year supply versus Bernanke,” said  Sean Murphy , a trader in
New York at Societe Generale SA, one of 21 primary dealers that
trade directly with the Fed.  Investors  bid  for 2.53 times the amount of debt offered at
the previous 10-year note sale on June 12, the least since
August at the monthly auctions.  Indirect bidders , the investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 51.7 percent of the securities, the
most since December 2011. Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer
investors that place their bids directly with the Treasury,
bought 11.7 percent, the least since September.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and similar-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of
trader expectations for consumer prices over the life of the
debt, was 2.05 percentage points. The spread has narrowed from
this year’s high of 2.61 percentage points on Feb. 4.  Chart ‘Congestion’  “Today’s 10-year sale comes before Bernanke’s speech and
the Fed minutes, so expectations should be reduced,” said  Marc Ostwald , a strategist at Monument Securities Ltd. in  London .
“The big level is at 2.85 percent, where there is a lot of
congestion on the charts. Investors are being discouraged as
there is not the stability that they want.”  A $32 billion sale of three-year notes yesterday drew a
yield of 0.719 percent, the  highest  since June 2011. The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with
the amount of securities offered, was 3.35, versus 2.95 at the
previous auction.  The government is also scheduled to auction $13 billion of
30-year bonds tomorrow in the final of its note and bond sales
this week.  Fed Policy  Bernanke is scheduled to speak on economic policy at 4:10
p.m. in  Boston .  Yields surged  when he told reporters after a
two-day policy meeting on June 19 that the Fed may begin to slow
its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases this year and end them
in 2014. Minutes of that meeting will be released at 2 p.m. in
Washington.  Fed Bank of San Francisco President  John Williams  said
critics including Nobel laureate  Paul Krugman , who say the
central bank hasn’t done enough to stimulate growth, disregard
how bond buying is an untested tool with an ambiguous impact.  “The claim that the Fed is responding insufficiently to
the shocks hitting the economy rests on the assumption that
policy is made with complete certainty about the effects of
policy on the economy,” Williams said in a paper posted
yesterday on the website of the San Francisco Fed. “Nothing
could be further from the truth.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
