Sun Catalytix Corp., a closely held
energy storage company, received $4 million in an equity
offering with five unnamed investors, according to a filing.  The company is seeking to raise $12 million, according to
the “total offering amount” listed today in a document filed
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Chief
Executive Officer Mike Decelle didn’t immediately return phone
and e-mail messages today seeking comment about the funding.  Sun Catalytix, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is backed
by Polaris Venture Partners and  Tata Group , and the company in
2010 received a $4 million grant from the U.S. Energy
Department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
