Praktiker AG (PRA) , a German home-improvement retailer, said it’s considering insolvency for
itself and units after some of its creditors didn’t approve more
financing.  Excessive debt and lack of liquidity are reasons for
declaring insolvency, the company said in a statement today.  Alternative financing became necessary after the company
failed to sell a stake in Luxembourg-based unit Batiself SA
because the buyer’s board didn’t approve a deal, Praktiker said.
Proceeds from a sale had been “firmly included” in the
retailer’s financing plan from last year, it said.  Shares in Praktiker were floated by then-parent  Metro AG (MEO)  in
2005. The company’s current shareholders include Donau Invest
Beteiligungs GmbH with a 10 percent stake and Maseltov Ltd. at
9.6 percent, according to its  website .  Praktiker posted a net loss last year of 190 million euros
($245 million) on revenue of 3 billion euros, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
