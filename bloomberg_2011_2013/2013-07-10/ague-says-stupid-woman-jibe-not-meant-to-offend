U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague 
said he didn’t intend any offense when he twice called an
opposition lawmaker a “stupid woman” during prime minister’s
questions in Parliament.  Cathy Jamieson, a Labour party lawmaker, asked Prime
Minister David Cameron in the House of Commons today if
donations to his Conservative Party by  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  Chief
Executive Officer Aidan Heavey had influenced Hague’s
intervention in a tax dispute involving the company.  Cameron responded with an attack on the Labour Party’s
links to unions. While he was doing so, Hague, who was sitting
next to the prime minister, could be  seen on television  twice
saying the words “stupid woman” at Jamieson.  Labour lawmaker Fiona O’Donnell later raised a point of
order in the Commons after Hague had made a statement on the
 Middle East , and the foreign secretary said he hadn’t intended
to offend.  “I mutter many things in the house, I mutter many things
under my breath,” Hague said. “I never intend any offence to
any other honorable member.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
