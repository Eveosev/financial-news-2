Indian bonds due 2022 advanced for a
second day as the rupee’s advance from a record low tempered
concern inflation will quicken.  The currency rose 0.8 percent in a second day of gains
today as Indian regulators took steps to curb speculative trade.
It touched an all-time low of 61.2125 on July 8. Global funds
were net buyers of rupee debt for the  first time  in 14 days on
July 8, exchange data show. They have cut holdings of local
bonds by $8.1 billion since May 22, when the U.S. Federal
Reserve first signaled it may pare stimulus that has driven
flows to emerging-market assets.  “A steady currency would definitely provide comfort to
bond markets, but it’s too early to say the rupee has
stabilized,” said Lakshmi Iyer, head of fixed income at Kotak
Mahindra Asset Management Co. in Mumbai. “Data showing foreign
funds were net buyers of debt is also positive.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.66 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The rate
climbed 18 basis points last month, the most since the
securities were issued in June 2012.  A sustained 10 percent drop in the rupee adds 150 basis
points to 200 basis points to  wholesale-price  inflation,
according to a Standard Chartered Plc research note last month.
Wholesale prices, which are more frequently used for policy
decisions, rose 4.7 percent in May from a year earlier, the
least since 2009, official data show.  Reserve Bank  of India
Governor Duvvuri Subbarao left the repurchase  rate  unchanged at
7.25 percent on June 17, citing inflation risks.  U.S. Stimulus  The rupee weakened 4.9 percent last month, the most since
May 2012. Global funds’ holdings of Indian bonds were at an  all-time high  on May 21, a day before Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
indicated the central bank’s asset-buying program could be
tapered if the U.S. job market continues to improve.  The RBI barred banks from proprietary trading in currency
futures and exchange-traded options, while the  Securities and
Exchange Board of India  said it will raise margin requirements
and curtail open positions.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell six basis
points to 7.49 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
