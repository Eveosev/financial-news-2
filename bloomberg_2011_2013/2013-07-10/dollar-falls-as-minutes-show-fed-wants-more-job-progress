The  dollar  dropped by the most since
October 2011 after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
the U.S. economy still requires monetary stimulus to bolster
growth and lower unemployment.  The greenback fell versus all but one of its 16 most-traded
peers after minutes of the Fed’s June meeting released yesterday
showed many policy makers wanted more signs the labor market is
improving before slowing bond purchases. Emerging-market
currencies rallied and stocks and  U.S. Treasuries  gained. The
yen strengthened after the  Bank of Japan  boosted its view of the
economy and refrained from adding stimulus.  “All the talk of the town is Bernanke and tapering and
what he did and didn’t say,”  Richard Franulovich , chief
currency strategist for the northern hemisphere at Westpac
Banking Corp. in  New York , said in a telephone interview. “I
look at euro, I look at equities, 10-year bond yields, they’re
still holding most of their Bernanke move.”  The Bloomberg  Dollar Index , which monitors 10 major
currencies, slid 1.4 percent to 1,034.33 at 5 p.m. in New York.
It was the biggest daily decline on a closing basis since Oct.
27, 2011.  The dollar lost 0.9 percent to $1.3097 per euro after
touching $1.3207, the weakest level since June 21. It
depreciated beyond its 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages
with  Europe ’s shared currency, which are seen by some traders as
potential turning points. The dollar fell 0.7 percent to 98.96
yen and slid to 98.27 yen, the lowest since June 27. The yen
fell 0.2 percent to 129.61 per euro.  ‘Massive Unwinding’  Futures traders had $14.2 billion of wagers as of June 25
that the dollar would rally against the pound, yen and six other
currencies, compared with $14.5 billion of bets at the end of
last year that the currency would decline, or net short
positions, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data compiled by Nomura Holdings Inc.  “Most of the investors I talk to, 90 percent of the
investors I talk to, are equally bullish the dollar,” David Woo, global head of rates and currencies at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch in New York, said in an interview on  Bloomberg
Radio ’s “Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “When positioning
becomes crowded, a little disappointment like we saw last night,
all of a sudden you see this massive unwinding” of the dollar.  Emerging-market currencies from  South Korea ’s won to
 Russia ’s ruble rallied after Bernanke signaled that stimulus to
the world’s largest economy won’t be dropped soon.  Ruble Climbs  The won climbed 1.2 percent to close at 1,122.41 per
dollar, the biggest gain since December 2011. The  ruble  advanced
1 percent to 32.5831 per dollar and reached 32.4795, the
strongest level since June 19.  Bernanke said yesterday in a question-answer session after
a speech in Cambridge,  Massachusetts , that “highly
accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable future is
what’s needed in the  U.S. economy .” U.S.  unemployment , at 7.6
percent, hasn’t been below 7 percent since November 2008.  Minutes of the Fed’s June 18-19 meeting released earlier
showed “many members indicated that further improvement in the
outlook for the labor market would be required before it would
be appropriate to slow the pace of asset purchases.” The Fed
buys $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage debt each month as
part of its quantitative-easing program to cap borrowing costs.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1.4 percent.
Benchmark U.S. 10-year  notes  rose for a fourth day, pushing
yields down five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 2.57
percent, the lowest in almost a week.  The greenback remained weaker versus the euro and yen after
Labor Department data showed initial claims for jobless benefits
in the U.S. unexpectedly rose last week to a two-month high of
360,000. A Bloomberg survey forecast a decline to 340,000.  Aussie, Kiwi  Not every currency is “reflecting the same reality at the
moment,” Westpac’s Franulovich said.  The Australian and New Zealand dollars pared earlier gains
versus the greenback. The kiwi, as the New Zealand currency is
known, was up 0.2 percent to 78.53 U.S. cents after climbing as
much as 1.7 percent to 79.69, the most since June 19. The Aussie
traded at 91.88 U.S. cents, a 0.2 percent advance, after
rallying 1.5 percent earlier to 93.06 cents.  “Given a deeper read of Bernanke’s Q&A, tapering is still
very much on the table,” Franulovich said. “That reaction by
Aussie and kiwi seems about right.”  The yen rose against the dollar as the BOJ increased its
assessment of the economy by referring to a recovery for the
first time since before an earthquake in March 2011. Policy
makers stuck with their pledge to expand the monetary base by 60
trillion yen ($606 billion) to 70 trillion yen per year and said
the economy was starting to improve moderately.  Options Trading  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $31 billion, compared with $37 billion yesterday,
according to data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust
Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on
the dollar-yen  exchange rate  amounted to $7.9 billion, the
largest share of trades at 25 percent. Euro-dollar options
totaled $7.1 billion, or 23 percent.  Dollar-yen options trading was 17 percent less than the
average for the past five Thursdays at a similar time in the
day, according to Bloomberg analysis. Euro-dollar options
trading was 53 percent more than average.  The dollar has dropped 2 percent over the past week versus
nine developed-nation counterparts tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen gained 0.4 percent, and
the euro rose 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
