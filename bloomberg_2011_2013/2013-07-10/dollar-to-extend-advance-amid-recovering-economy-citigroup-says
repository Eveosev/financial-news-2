The dollar will extend gains versus
its major counterparts this year and next as more investors
recognize the world’s biggest economy is sustaining growth,
according to Citigroup Inc.’s Steven Englander.  “The market is still resisting the view that the U.S. is
in a recovery,” Englander, head of Group of 10 currency
strategy at Citigroup in  New York , said today in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and
 Michael McKee . “Whether against the yen, the euro or  emerging
markets , the dollar looks very, very sound.”  The greenback has strengthened this year against all of its
16 most-traded counterparts, advancing 16 percent versus the yen
and gaining 2.7 percent against the euro. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index closed yesterday within 1 percent of a record high
after Alcoa Inc. started the U.S. earnings season with results
that beat analysts’ estimates.  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback
against 10 major peers, declined 0.3 percent to 1049.98 today in
New York after reaching 1056.33 on July 8, the highest level on
an intraday basis since June 30, 2010.  “Buying the dollar is still the better call,” Englander
said. “The U.S. recovery is unique in a world that’s not
recovering.”  The dollar gauge has risen 3.7 percent since June 18, the
day before Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the
central bank may reduce the $85 billion of Treasuries and
mortgages it buys each month and end them in mid-2014 if the
economy performs in line with Fed projections. Bernanke will
speak at a conference today in Boston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
