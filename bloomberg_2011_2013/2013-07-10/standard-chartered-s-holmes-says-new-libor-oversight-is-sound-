Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) ’s chief
executive officer for Europe, Richard Holmes, backed the
appointment of  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  as administrators for the London
interbank offered rate.  “NYSE Euronext already administers the futures exchange,”
Holmes said in an interview with  Mark Barton  and Anna Edwards on
Bloomberg Television’s “Countdown.” “The structure being put
in place is very sound.”  The New York Stock Exchange operator said yesterday it will
replace the British Bankers’ Association in administering Libor,
vowing to restore confidence to the benchmark amid a rigging
scandal. More than $300 trillion in securities are benchmarked
to the rate, which has been regulated by the U.K. Financial
Conduct Authority since April as part of an overhaul.  NYSE Euronext may be able to strengthen the validity of
Libor by adding trades to the way it’s calculated, which is
currently based on quotes, said Holmes.  “One of the things being looked at is the basis and
whether you can use actual transactions and quotes in
combination,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
