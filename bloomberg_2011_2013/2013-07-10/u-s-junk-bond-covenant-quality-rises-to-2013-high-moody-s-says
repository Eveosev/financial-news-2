The strength of U.S. speculative-grade bond covenants written into the terms of debt agreements
to protect investors rose in June to a six-month high, according
to Moody’s Investors Service.  The average covenant score, in which 1 is the strongest and
5 the weakest, fell to 3.72 in June from 3.99 percent the
previous month, Moody’s analysts led by Alexander Dill wrote in
a report dated yesterday. That’s the strongest since 3.63 in
December.  Bonds with ratings in the top junk tier of Ba, which
typically have weaker covenant packages, accounted for 21
percent of high-yield bonds issued in June, below a historical
average of 27 percent, the analysts said.  “With issuance down sharply in June and many companies
postponing deals, those that went to market may have had to
offer somewhat better covenant terms to a suddenly more
discriminating market,” they wrote.  Bonds from  Rite Aid Corp. (RAD) , the third largest U.S. drug-store chain, offered the strongest protections last month, while
the debentures of aircraft parts manufacturer  TransDigm Group
Inc. (TDG)  had the weakest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
