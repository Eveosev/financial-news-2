The pound strengthened from a three-year low against the dollar amid speculation a selloff in the
past week was excessive before minutes of this month’s  Bank of
England  monetary policy meeting are released next week.  Sterling dropped to the weakest since June 2010 yesterday
when a report showed U.K. manufacturing unexpectedly shrank in
May, casting doubt on the strength of the recovery. Consumer-and
producer-price inflation reports are scheduled for July 16, with
the details of  Mark Carney ’s first meeting as Bank of  England 
governor due the following day. The dollar fell versus most
major peers today before Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  speaks on the economy. U.K. government bonds rose.  “The pound seems to be finding some support against the
dollar after the recent decline,” said  Roberto Mialich , a
currency strategist at  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  in Milan. “But that
doesn’t change a longer-term outlook that sterling should remain
under pressure because of the Bank of England’s policy.”  The pound rose 0.4 percent to $1.4933 at 4:29 p.m.  London 
time after dropping to $1.4814 yesterday, the lowest level since
June 23, 2010. The U.K. currency was little changed at 85.97
pence per euro after depreciating to 86.69 pence yesterday, the
weakest since March 14.  Sterling slumped 1.7 percent in the past week, the worst
performer of 10 developed-nation currencies, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar strengthened
0.9 percent, while the euro declined 0.6 percent.  Record Low  The Bank of England signaled last week it would keep U.K.
interest rates at a record low for longer than investors
anticipated, weighing on the currency. It left its benchmark
 interest rate  at 0.5 percent and kept the size of its bond-purchase program at 375 billion pounds.  Policy maker  David Miles  speaks in London tomorrow on
household-debt repayment. Miles, who has voted for additional
bond purchases every month since November, said on June 26 that
he didn’t “think we should be in a hurry in the U.K. to move
the monetary policy dials to more normal settings.”  Bernanke will probably use a “dovish tone” to avoid
market stress after investors mistook his plan to reduce bond
purchases for a signal on tighter monetary policy, Jane Foley, a
senior currency strategist at Rabobank International in London,
wrote today in a note to clients.  The Fed chairman sparked a global rout in fixed-income
assets on June 19 when he said the central bank could reduce
stimulus if the U.S. job market improves.  Gilts Rise  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 2.41 percent after declining five
basis points yesterday. The 1.75 percent bond maturing in
September 2022 climbed 0.185, or 1.85 pounds per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 94.595.  The Debt Management Office plans to auction 2.5 billion
pounds of gilts due in January 2044 tomorrow. It last sold 30-year securities on May 16 at an average yield of 3.293 percent.  Gilts maturing in 25 years or longer handed investors a 5.9
percent loss in the three months through June, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch indexes, the biggest quarterly decline
since the period ended March 2009.  U.K. gilts dropped 3.5 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German bonds dropped
1.2 percent and Treasuries fell 3.4 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
