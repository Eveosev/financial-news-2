Italian industrial  output  rose less
than expected in May, indicating the country is struggling to
emerge from its longest recession in more than two decades.  Production rose 0.1 percent from April, when it fell 0.3
percent, national statistics office  Istat  said in  Rome  today.
Economists had forecast output to rise 0.3 percent, according to
the median of 11 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  The  International Monetary Fund  last week cut its growth
outlook for Italy, forecasting a 1.8 percent contraction in
2013, which matched a May prediction by the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development. The nation’s credit rating
was lowered by  Standard & Poor’s  yesterday because expectations
for a weakening in economic prospects and the country’s impaired
financial system.  In May, output fell an annual 4.2 percent on a workday-adjusted basis, Istat said.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
