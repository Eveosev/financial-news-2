Ghana ’s  financial-stocks  gauge,
which tracks the performance of banks and insurers, rose to the
highest in more than two weeks on speculation lenders invested
in Treasury bills that have Africa’s second-highest yields.  The 11-member Ghana Stock Exchange Financial Stocks Index
advanced for the fourth day in five, adding 0.8 percent to 1,621
by the close in the capital, Accra, the highest since June 24.
The GSE Composite Index, Africa’s best performer this year, rose
0.4 percent to 1,888.68.  “There’s anticipation over banks’ first-half results,”
Randy Mensah, a stock trader at Ecobank Development Corp. in
Accra, said by phone. “It’s speculated that they grew earnings
by investing in government Treasury bills.”  Borrowing costs for Ghana’s  91-day notes  were 23.1 percent
at the last auction on July 5 and held above 23 percent since
May. The rate is the highest in  Africa  after Malawi, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Retail investors see the banks as a safe place to stay,”
Mensah said. Banks will start releasing results for the six
months through June by July 15, he said.  Shares of GCB Bank Ltd., Ghana’s biggest lender by
branches, rose 3.9 percent, the biggest jump since April 10, to
4.80 cedis, with trading volume 1.8 times the three-month daily
average. CAL Bank Ltd. gained 1.2 percent to 84 pesewas, the
highest in more than five years, while mortgage lender HFC Bank
Ltd. advanced 1.8 percent to 56 pesewas, a three-year high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
