600 Index little changed at its highest level in a month.  Commodity producers slid as the release fueled concern

exports and imports, adding to concerns that the slowdown in
 China  is intensifying amid weakness in both external and
domestic demand,” Gary Dugan, Coutts & Co.’s Singapore-based
chief investment officer, wrote in a note. “This will test how
far the government is willing to sacrifice weak near-term growth
for the sake of its longer-term policy objectives.”  A report from the General Administration of Customs in
Beijing showed that China’s exports fell 3.1 percent in June

in 2013, and may halt purchases in the middle of 2014 if the
 U.S. economy  performs as the Fed forecasts.  National benchmark indexes fell in 10 of the 18 western-European markets today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100,  Germany ’s DAX and
 France ’s CAC 40 all slipped 0.1 percent.  Italy’s FTSE MIB Index declined 0.7 percent after S&P

financial system. A report today showed  Italian industrial
production  rose in May less than economists had predicted.
