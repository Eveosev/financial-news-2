Copper dropped for a second day
after  China ’s exports and imports both unexpectedly declined,
fueling concern that slowing economic growth will hurt metals
demand in the world’s largest user.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange lost 0.4 percent to $6,704.75 a metric ton at 10:57
a.m. in  Shanghai . The price slipped to $6,671.75 yesterday, the
lowest since June 28. Zinc fell 0.5 percent to $1,859 a ton.  Overseas shipments fell 3.1 percent from a year earlier,
the General Administration of Customs said today. This compared
with the median estimate of a 3.7 percent gain in a Bloomberg
News survey. Imports declined 0.7 percent after a 0.3 percent
drop in May.  “The pessimism brought by China’s overall trade data
overshadowed positive implications from a rebound in copper
imports,” said Xu Liping, an analyst at HNA Topwin Futures Co.
“Concerns over China’s macro economy will persist.”  Unwrought copper and copper products  imports  by China were
379,951 tons in June, the customs agency said today in a
statement on its website. That compared with 358,672 tons in May
and 346,223 tons a year ago.  Copper for delivery in November on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 1.5 percent to 48,200  yuan  ($7,858) a ton. Metal
for delivery in September on the Comex lost 0.8 percent to
$3.0405 a pound.  On the LME, aluminum, tin and lead were little changed
while nickel gained.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
