The evacuation of passengers after
an Asiana Airlines Inc. plane crash-landed didnâ€™t start for 90
seconds and was hindered by emergency slides that went off
inside the jet and trapped flight attendants, U.S. investigators
said today.  U.S. National Transportation Safety Board Chairman  Deborah
Hersman  described a chaotic evacuation as fire erupted outside
the fuselage on July 6 in San Francisco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
