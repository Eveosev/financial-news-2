Cia. Paranaense de Energia ,  Brazil ’s
worst-performing utility in the past month, rose the most since
April after it reached an agreement with regulators to increase
electricity prices.  Copel, as the power company is known,  gained  7.8 percent to
29.77 reais at 12:25 p.m. in Sao Paulo, the steepest advance
since April 5 on a closing basis. It led advances on the
benchmark Ibovespa index, which  added  1 percent.  The utility said in a filing yesterday it will raise rates
by 9.55 percent retroactively from June 24. The shares posted a
record  plunge  on June 21 after a rate increase of as much as
14.61 percent was suspended amid growing nationwide protests
over inflation and corruption. Copel can further raise rates
next year to make up the difference between the actual and
previously expected increase, Romeu Rufino, head of Brazil’s
electricity regulator Aneel, said yesterday in Brasilia.  “This is good news for Copel as it ends the uncertainties
about the postponement of its tariff adjustment,” Oswaldo Telles and Frederico Lebre, analysts at Banco Espirito Santo SA,
wrote in a note to clients today. It also “confirms that all
the postponed part of the increase will be compensated in the
future, with no economic loss to the company.”  Copel, based in Curitiba, Brazil, has declined 6.1 percent
this year, while the Ibovespa lost 25 percent in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
