Italian borrowing costs rose at an
auction of one-year bills today after Standard & Poor’s cut the
country’s credit rating on concern that the economy will
struggle to recover.  The Rome-based Treasury sold 7 billion euros ($8.98
billion) of 367-day bills at 1.078 percent, up from 0.962
percent at the previous auction June 12. Investors bid for 1.56
times the amount offered, up from 1.49 last month. Italy also
sold 2.5 billion euros of 160-day bills at 0.599 percent.  Italy’s 10-year bond yield rose 4 basis points to 4.5
percent after the sale at 11:19 a.m. in  Rome , leaving the
difference with comparable German bunds at 280.9 basis points.  Standard & Poor’s yesterday cut Italy’s long-term credit
rating to BBB, two levels above junk, from BBB+, citing
expectations for a weakening in economic prospects and the
nation’s impaired financial system. The outlook on the rating
remains negative, the New York-based ratings company said in a
statement.  “This downgrade of S&P is a wake-up call for the current
government, which has not been able to execute job-market
reforms so far,” Alessandro Giansanti, a senior interest-rate
strategist at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam, said in a note today.  “Although Italian yields are already priced in for a BBB
rating, the downgrade will cause widening pressure and a flatter
curve, especially ahead of tomorrow’s auctions.”  The Italian Treasury returns to the market tomorrow with
the sale of longer-maturity bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
