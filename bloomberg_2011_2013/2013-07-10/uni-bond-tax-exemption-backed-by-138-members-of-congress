More than a hundred members of the
U.S. House of Representatives are pressing to keep the century-old  tax exemption  on income from state- and local-government
bonds, saying measures to roll it back would push added costs to
municipalities.  The letter, signed by 138 lawmakers from both parties and
sent to two top House leaders yesterday, cited “serious
concerns” about proposals to eliminate or limit the exemption,
according to a copy released by Municipal Bonds for America, a
group lobbying to protect the tax break.  “Eliminating or capping the current deduction on municipal
bonds would severely curtail state and local governments’
ability to invest in themselves,” they said in the letter. “It
would increase borrowing costs to public entities and shift
costs to local residents through tax or rate increases.”  The letter was sent to Representative  Nancy Pelosi  of
California, the Democratic leader, and House Speaker  John Boehner , a Republican from Ohio.  State and local governments have been lobbying to keep the
tax exemption for investors’ income from municipal debt, which
holds down borrowing costs for schools, roads and mass-transit.
President  Barack Obama  has proposed capping the tax break for
high earners, though that proposal hasn’t advanced in Congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
