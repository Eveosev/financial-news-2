A wind farm in eastern  Romania  is
being considered for a loan of as much as 59 million euros ($76
million) from the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, helping the country meet renewable-energy targets.  The loan for the 84.2 million-euro project, being developed
by Spainâ€™s Inveravante Inversiones Universales SL, is pending
final review, the London-based bank said in a  statement  on its
website. The 54-megawatt plant will be built in Galati county.  Romania, which borders the  Black Sea  in southeast Europe,
plans to get 38 percent of its power from clean energy by 2020,
up from about 5 percent last year, according to the EBRD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
