Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the U.S. needs very stimulative monetary policy
for the foreseeable future.  “Highly accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable
future is what’s needed in the U.S. economy,” Bernanke said
today in response to a question after a speech in Cambridge,
 Massachusetts .  Bernanke said low inflation and high unemployment mean the
Fed needs to press on with its stimulus. He said he expects
inflation to “come back up” closer to the central bank’s 2
percent goal.  U.S. stock futures rose and Treasuries erased losses after
his unscripted remarks. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures
expiring in September rose 0.7 percent to 1,656.4 at 5:25 p.m.
in New York. The yield on the 10-year note was little changed at
2.63 percent at 5 p.m. in New York, after rising to as high as
2.68 percent following the release of the minutes.  Earlier today, the Fed released minutes of the Federal Open
Market Committee’s June 18-19 policy meeting at which many
officials indicated they want to see more signs employment is
picking up before they’ll begin scaling back $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
