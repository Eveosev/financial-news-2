U.S. oil  production  jumped last week
to the highest level since January 1992, cutting consumption of
foreign fuel and putting the U.S. closer to energy independence.  Drilling techniques including hydraulic fracturing, or
fracking, pushed crude output up by 134,000 barrels, or 1.8
percent, to 7.401 million barrels a day in the seven days ended
July 5, the Energy Information Administration said today.  Rising crude supplies from oilfields including  North
Dakota ’s Bakken shale and the Eagle Ford in  Texas  have helped
the U.S. become the world’s largest exporter of refined fuels
including gasoline and diesel. The shale boom has also helped
cut world reliance on OPEC oil even as global demand gains.  “It adds to supply in a world where demand continues to
grow, and it certainly reduces our reliance on OPEC,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC, a Houston-based
consulting firm, who expects output to reach 7.75 million
barrels a day by the end of this year.  The U.S. met 89 percent of its own energy needs in March,
the highest monthly rate since April 1986, EIA data show. Net
imports of crude oil and petroleum products will fall to 5.7
million barrels a day by 2014, down from 12.5 million in 2005,
the EIA said yesterday in its  Short-Term Energy Outlook .  Domestic crude output will average 7.31 million barrels a
day in 2013 and 8.09 million in 2014, the EIA, a unit of the
Energy Department, said in the report.  OPEC Decline  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said
today that consumption of its crude will decline 300,000 barrels
a day next year to 29.6 million, 2.6 percent less than the 12-member group is pumping now. World oil consumption will advance
by 1 million barrels a day, or 1.2 percent, to 90.7 million next
year as emerging nations expand and developed economies continue
to recover, the organization’s Vienna-based secretariat said in
its monthly market report.  The abundance of crude has made the U.S. an increasingly
important refining hub. Distillate production, largely comprised
of  diesel fuel , soared to a record 5.036 million barrels a day
last week, the EIA said today.  Some of that will be put on tankers to meet foreign demand.
 Venezuela , for example, imported an average of 94,000 barrels a
day through April, compared with 85,000 barrels a day in 2012,
EIA data show.  China’s  imports expanded to 108,000 barrels a
day, also up from 85,000 last year.  “Refiners have been modifying and investing in their
operations to produce increasing amounts of diesel, which is
growing worldwide at a much faster rate than gasoline demand,”
Lipow said.  West Texas Intermediate futures rose $2.99, or 2.9 percent,
to $106.52 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
highest settlement price since March 27, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
