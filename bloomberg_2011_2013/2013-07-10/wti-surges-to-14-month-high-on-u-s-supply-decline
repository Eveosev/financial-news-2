West Texas Intermediate crude surged
to a 15-month high after U.S. stockpiles tumbled for a second
week. WTI’s discount to Brent narrowed to less than $2 for the
first time since December 2010.  Oil advanced 2.9 percent after the Energy Information
Administration said supplies fell 9.87 million barrels, three
times as much as projected in a Bloomberg  survey . WTI has moved
into backwardation, with futures closest to expiration more
expensive than those for later delivery. The gain accelerated as
minutes from a Federal Reserve meeting showed many officials
want employment to pick up before slowing stimulus.  “There’s no incentive to hold supplies with the market in
backwardation,” said  Chip Hodge , who oversees a $9 billion
natural-resource bond portfolio as senior managing director at
Manulife Asset Management in  Boston . “You are seeing big drops
in inventories and that should continue.”  WTI crude for August delivery climbed $2.99 to $106.52 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since March 27, 2012. The volume of all futures
traded was double the 100-day average at 3:44 p.m. The August
contract was 90 cents more expensive than the September one, the
steepest premium since October 2008.  Brent oil for August settlement increased 70 cents, or 0.6
percent, to end the session at $108.51 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The volume for all contracts
was 35 percent above the 100-day average.  Disappearing Discount  The U.S. benchmark’s shrinking  discount  to its European
counterpart, Brent from the  North Sea , underlines the easing of
a supply bottleneck in the U.S. The spread widened to as much as
$23.44 a barrel on Feb. 8 before contracting to as little as
$1.82 today. It was $1.99 at the settlement.  U.S. crude stockpiles have fallen 20.2 million barrels, or
5.1 percent, to 373.9 million in the last two reports, the
biggest two-week plunge since at least 1982, according to EIA,
the Energy Department’s statistical unit. Supplies surged to
397.6 million on May 24, the highest level since 1931.  “WTI is the leader now,” said  Stephen Schork , president
of the Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “The last
two reports have been real eye-openers. You’ve had two massive
supply declines and there’s a lot of speculative interest
entering the market.”  The report was forecast to show a 3.2 million-barrel drop,
according to the median of 11 analyst surveyed by Bloomberg.  Rising Production  Crude production  rose 1.8 percent to 7.4 million barrels a
day last week, the most since January 1992, the EIA said. Output
has surged as the combination of horizontal drilling and
hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has unlocked supplies trapped
in shale formations in the central part of the country.  Stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for WTI
crude dropped 2.69 million barrels to 47 million last week, the
report showed. Supplies reached a record 51.9 million barrels in
the week ended Jan. 11.  “We’re seeing a reordering at Cushing, which is very
supportive to WTI,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again
Capital LLC, a New York hedge fund that focuses on energy.
“Cushing is no longer a bottleneck as new delivery routes have
become available because of investment in pipelines and rail.”  Refineries operated  at 92.4 percent of capacity, up 0.2
percentage point from the prior week and the highest level this
year. Utilization rates usually peak during the summer months
when U.S. gasoline demand rises. Production of the motor fuel
climbed 2.2 percent to 9.59 million barrels a day, the highest
level since August 2010.  “Production keeps climbing but refiners are obviously
doing a good job working their way through it,” Schork said.  Fuel Stockpiles  Gasoline stockpiles unexpectedly fell 2.63 million barrels
to 221 million. Inventories of  distillate fuel , a category that
includes heating oil and diesel, advanced 3.04 million to 123.8
million. Supplies of both gasoline and distillate fuel were
projected to advance 1 million barrels in the Bloomberg survey.  Consumption of gasoline increased 1.8 percent to 9.08
million barrels a day averaged over the last four weeks, the
highest level since August, the report showed.  Gasoline for August delivery increased 8.89 cents, or 3
percent, to $3.0149 a gallon on the Nymex, the highest
settlement since April 2.  “Everything is going for the market right now,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a  New York  hedge fund
that focuses on energy. “Refineries are operating at higher
rates, which is increasing demand for crude. At the same time,
gasoline demand is up above 9 million barrels a day for the
first time in a long while.”  Fed Minutes  The minutes from the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s June
18-19 meeting show officials want to see that employment is
improving before reducing the pace of $85 billion in monthly
bond purchases.  “Many members indicated that further improvement in the
outlook for the labor market would be required before it would
be appropriate to slow the pace of asset purchases,” according
to the record of the Fed gathering released today in  Washington .  The dollar fell against the euro after the release of the
minutes, bolstering the appeal of commodities denominated in the
U.S. currency as an investment. The dollar slipped as much as
1.3 percent against the common currency. The Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Index of 24 raw materials reached 644.62, the highest level
since April 3, led by gains in gasoline and WTI.  Technical Indicator  The U.S. benchmark oil extended its rally after breaching a
technical resistance level on the weekly chart, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Futures settled above $103.39 a
barrel, the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the decline to
$32.40 in December 2008 from an intraday record high of $147.27
in July that year. Investors typically buy contracts when prices
exceed technical resistance.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
September was 23.5 percent, up from 22 percent yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 1.11 million
contracts as of 3:44 p.m. It totaled 794,959 contracts
yesterday, 22 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.82 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
