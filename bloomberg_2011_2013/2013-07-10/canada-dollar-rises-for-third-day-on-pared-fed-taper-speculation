The Canadian dollar rose for a third
day as Federal Reserve meeting minutes showed divisions among
policy makers about the timeframe for withdrawing monetary
stimulus known as quantitative easing.  The currency had fallen to an almost two-year low after Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said after the June 19 meeting the
central bank may trim its bond-buying this year and halt it
around mid-2014 if economic performance tracks its forecast.
Crude oil,  Canada ’s biggest export, reached its highest level in
15 months amid declining stockpiles. The Bank of Canada sold
five-year notes.  “Talk of wrapping up QE by the end of the year has led to
a quick turnaround in the U.S. dollar” against its Canadian
counterpart, Adam Button, a currency analyst at Forexlive.com in
 Montreal , said in a telephone interview.  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, rose 0.6 percent to
C$1.0465 per  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto, after rising to
as high as C$1.0447. The currency fell to C$1.0609 on July 5,
the weakest level since October 2011. One loonie buys 95.56 U.S.
cents.  Minutes of the last meeting of the  Federal Open Market
Committee  released today said “about half” of 19 participants
indicated “it likely would be appropriate to end asset
purchases late this year.” “Many other” FOMC members said it
would be appropriate to continue purchases into 2014, the
minutes said, while “a few” wanted to slow or stop the
purchases at the June meeting.  Fed Message  “Once the information gets absorbed, the takeaway will be
more hawkish and the market will reverse itself,”  Jack Spitz ,
Toronto-based managing director of foreign exchange at  National
Bank of Canada , said in a phone interview following the release
of the minutes.  Implied volatility for three-month options on the Canadian
dollar versus its U.S. counterpart fell to 8 percent from 8.23
percent the previous day. Implied volatility, which traders
quote and use to set option prices and signals the expected pace
of currency swings, reached the highest in a year on June 24 at
8.87 percent.  Crude oil futures added 2.6 percent to $106.17 a barrel in
 New York , after reaching the highest level since March 2012.
  “Oil has been a bit of a tailwind for the Canadian dollar,”
Button said. “That’s coming back on traders’ radars.”  Bonds Fall  Canada’s benchmark 10-year bonds fell, pushing yields two
basis points higher to 2.49 percent. The 1.5 percent security
maturing in June 2023 dropped 13 cents to C$91.39.  The  Bank of Canada  sold C$3.4 billion ($3.2 billion) of
1.25 percent notes maturing in September 2018.  The securities fetched an average yield of 1.884 percent
and had a coverage ratio -- the amount bid relative to the
amount sold -- of 2.5. The previous five-year auction on May 8
had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.7, according to Bank of Canada’s
website.  The Canadian dollar has risen 1 percent in the past three
months against nine developed nations currencies tracked by the
Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Index, helped by the gains in the
price of its biggest export, oil. The U.S. dollar has gained 5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
