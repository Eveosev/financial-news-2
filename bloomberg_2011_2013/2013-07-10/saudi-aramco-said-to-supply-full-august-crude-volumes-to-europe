Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the worldâ€™s
largest crude exporter, will supply full volumes in August to
customers in Europe, unchanged from this month, according to
three refinery officials with knowledge of the matter.  Saudi Aramco , as the company is known, will provide 100
percent of crude cargoes sold under long-term contracts, said
the people, who asked not to be identified because the
agreements are confidential.  Saudi Arabia in March exported 600,000 barrels a day of
Arab Light and Extra Light blend and 100,000 barrels of Arab
Heavy grade to European members of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development except Estonia, Hungary and
Slovenia, the  International Energy Agency  said in its monthly
oil market report on June 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
