Forgame Tech Co. , a Chinese designer
of online games, is planning an initial public offering of at
least $100 million in Hong Kong, two people with knowledge of
the matter said.  The Guangzhou-based company has submitted an application to
Hong Kong’s stock exchange and plans to start the IPO this year,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
information is private. The size of the offering will depend on
whether some shareholders choose to sell stock in addition to
new shares being issued, the people said.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley are among banks
working on the offering, the people said.  TA Associates  and
Qiming Venture Partners bought stakes in Forgame in July last
year, according to the two investors’ websites.  Founded in 2009, Forgame has developed more than 20 cloud-based multiplayer games, according to its website. Two calls to
Forgame’s head office in Guangzhou went unanswered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
