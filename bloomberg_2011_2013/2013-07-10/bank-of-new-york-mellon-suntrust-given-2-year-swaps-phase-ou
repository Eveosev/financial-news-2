Bank of  New York  Mellon Corp. and
SunTrust Banks Inc. will have an extra two years to separate
derivatives trading from units that get federal backing,
according to letters to the banks posted on the Federal Reserve
website.  The Fed said in the letters dated yesterday that the banks
must determine whether to halt the swaps activity or move it to
properly capitalized affiliates. Under the Dodd-Frank Act rule
requiring the swaps push-out, interest-rate and some credit
swaps can still be traded inside the banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
