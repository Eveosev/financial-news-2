Hog futures rallied, heading for the
biggest gain in almost two weeks, on speculation that China, the
world’s biggest pork consumer, may boost purchases of U.S. meat.
Cattle fell.  Chinese pork prices rose 0.3 percent in the week ended July
7 from the previous week, the Ministry of Commerce said in a
statement on its website yesterday.  Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD)  Chief
Executive Officer C. Larry Pope is scheduled to testify today
before the Senate Agricultural Committee about the proposed $4.7
billion acquisition of the world’s largest pork supplier by a
Chinese company. The deal has fueled speculation that Chinese
demand for U.S. pork will accelerate.  Chinese pork “prices were up,”  Don Roose , the president
of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines , Iowa, said in a
telephone interview. “Maybe they do try to slow that down and
import more pork.”  Hog futures for August settlement climbed 1.2 percent to
96.275 cents a pound at 10 a.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile
Exchange, heading for the biggest gain for the most-active
contract since June 27.  Cattle futures for August delivery slid 0.1 percent to
$1.22625 a pound in Chicago. Feeder-cattle futures for August
settlement slipped 0.2 percent to $1.5085 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
