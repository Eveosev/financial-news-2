The U.K. expects to exceed carbon-reduction targets through 2022 by almost 300 million tons,
Climate Change Minister  Greg Barker  said. That’s a saving of
about half a year’s emissions at current levels.  Answering questions from lawmakers in Parliament’s
Environmental Audit Committee, Barker said his department
projects the nation will produce less carbon than stipulated in
its first three so-called carbon budgets, by 90 million tons,
132 million tons and 71 million tons respectively. The
“budgets” set caps for successive 5-year periods through 2022.  “There is a gap to fill in the fourth carbon budget
period,” Barker said today. “That simply reflects the reality
that 2023-2027 is still a fair time in the future and we have
not set out a detailed policy that far ahead.”  The budgets are set to ensure the U.K. meets a self-imposed
legally binding target to cut  greenhouse gases  80 percent from
1990 levels by 2050. The government’s own adviser on climate
policy, the Committee on  Climate Change , warned in a report last
month that Britain must step up the pace of carbon cuts or risk
a “big gap” between targets and emissions.  Barker said today he would respond in full to the
committee’s report in October.  The U.K. emitted 2,915 megatons of carbon dioxide for the
five years through 2012, the Committee on Climate Change said
last month, citing preliminary data. That works out at 583
megatons a year and compares with the budgetary cap of 3,018
megatons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
