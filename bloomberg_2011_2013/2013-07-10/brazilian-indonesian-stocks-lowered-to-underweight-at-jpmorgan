Brazilian (IBOV)  and  Indonesian (JCI)  stocks were
cut to the equivalent of sell by JPMorgan Chase & Co. on concern
slower growth in China will hurt exports in the Latin American
country and a weaker rupiah will curb earnings growth.  Brazil’s economic recovery may be hindered by higher
spending by the government, JPMorgan analysts including  Adrian Mowat  wrote in a research note today. Protesters took to the
streets last month to demand better public services in the
country’s biggest demonstrations in two decades.  “The response to the current unrest is policies that we
believe add to fiscal deterioration,” the JPMorgan analysts
wrote. “Add to that the impact of higher global bond yields on
a country with a current account deficit and China economic
risk.”  JPMorgan raised its recommendation on  Russian (INDEXCF)  and South
Korean stocks to the equivalent of hold. Russia will benefit
from higher oil prices, which boosts the outlook for producers
and also strengthens the country’s currency and fiscal position.  In South Korea, local borrowing costs are expected to
increase, benefiting life insurers and banks, even as policy
makers hold the target lending rate for the rest of 2013,
according to JPMorgan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
