Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) , the
investment bank founded by former U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
 Roger Altman , hired Nigel Dawn and Nicolas Lanel from  UBS AG (UBSN)  to
lead a new private capital advisory business.  Dawn, who will oversee the unit globally, was previously a
managing director and global co-head of the private funds group
at UBS, New York-based Evercore said today in a statement.
Lanel, who will lead the European operation, was a managing
director and global co-head of secondary markets advisory at the
Zurich-based bank, according to the statement.  The new business, scheduled to start in the second half,
will focus on secondary transactions for private funds,
according to the statement. Evercore, run by Chief Executive
Officer Ralph Schlosstein, operates a  private funds group  that
provides advice on capital raising and private-equity
investments for clients including general partners.  “We believe this business leverages the relationship
network and market presence of our firm,” Schlosstein, 62, said
in the statement. “We are excited that we have brought together
a highly experienced team to lead this business.”  The unit will be majority owned by Evercore alongside key
principals, including Dawn and Lanel, the firm said. Evercore
will start the business after it hires additional employees in
 North America  and Europe, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
