DGC One AB (DGC) , a Swedish developer of
communications systems, rose to a six-week high after receiving
a five-year, 135 million krona ($19.9 million) order from state-owned gambling company AB Svenska Spel.  DGC  advanced  as much as 5.4 percent to 83.25 kronor, the
highest intraday price since May 27, and was trading 4.1 percent
higher at 1 p.m. in Stockholm, valuing the company at 713
million kronor. Volume was more than double the three-month
average. The stock has increased 27 percent this year.  The contract includes an option for an extension of as much
as three years, Stockholm-based DGC said today in a statement.
Svenska Spel announced its decision for the procurement on June
25 and as the time limit to object to the gambling company’s
choice of partner has now passed, the parties will sign the deal
after the country’s mid-year vacation period, DGC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
