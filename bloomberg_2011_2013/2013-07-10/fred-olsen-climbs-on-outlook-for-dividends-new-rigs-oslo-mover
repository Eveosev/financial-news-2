Fred Olsen Energy ASA (FOE)  rose to a six-week high in Oslo ahead of the offshore drilling company’s
quarterly results tomorrow, which analysts say may provide more
detail on plans for increased dividends or new rig purchases.  Shares in the company gained as much as 1.3 percent to
261.8 kroner, the highest intraday level since May 28. They
traded 0.7 percent higher as of 10:25 a.m. local time, extending
their gain during the last 12 months to 20 percent.  Like Norwegian competitor  Seadrill Ltd. (SDRL) , Fred Olsen is
expanding and upgrading its fleet to take advantage of increased
investment in offshore exploration. The company, which owns
deepwater drilling rigs and semi-submersible vessels, has two
units under construction: an ultra-deepwater drillship due in
2013 and an ultra-deepwater semi-submersible due in early 2015.  “With a strong  balance sheet  and earnings per share to
increase to 42 kroner in 2015, Fred Olsen Energy has the
capacity to increase dividends and/or order new rigs,” Pareto
Securities AS said in a note today. The “main focus tomorrow
will be on the dividend and newbuild plans, said the broker,
which has a  buy recommendation  on the stock and a 12-month price
target of 300 kroner.  Fred Olsen, based in the Norwegian capital, is expected to
report second-quarter net income of  469.8 million kroner ,
according to the average of 11 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares with 614.5 million kroner a year
earlier and 444.4 million in the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
