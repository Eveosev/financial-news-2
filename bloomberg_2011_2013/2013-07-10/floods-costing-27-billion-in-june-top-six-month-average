Storms in Central Europe,  Canada  and
India fueled about $27 billion in flooding-related economic
losses in June, as the damage in one month exceeded the 10-year
average for the first half of a year.  Flooding caused about $22 billion in economic losses in
Europe and $3.8 billion in Canada,  Aon Plc (AON) ’s Impact Forecasting
said today in a  report . The average flooding cost for the first
six months of a year is about $20 billion, Steve Bowen, a senior
scientist and meteorologist at Impact, said in an interview.
This year the total is $37.8 billion through June 30, he said.  “It’s definitely not the norm” to have costs of more than
$25 billion in a month, said Bowen. While surges from tropical
storms are often associated with the worst floods, the June
catastrophes “have all been as a result of exceptionally heavy
rainfall that prompted major rivers and their tributaries to
overflow in densely populated areas,” he said.  At least 23 people were killed in Europe from flooding that
began in late May, Impact said. Insured losses on the continent
may be as high as $5.3 billion, with most of the costs in
 Germany , according to the statement. Flooding in Calgary last
month contributed to costs for insurers of up to $1 billion in
Canada, Impact said.   Chubb Corp. (CB)  is among insurers that suffered flooding-related losses in the period. The firm slumped $1.60, or 1.8
percent to $85.40 at 2:25 p.m. in New York, the biggest decline
in the 22-company Standard & Poor’s 500 Insurance Index. The
Warren, New Jersey-based company said late yesterday that
disasters including U.S. storms and Canada flooding cost $156
million after tax, or 60 cents a share, in the second quarter.  Insured losses for the industry in June may be as much as
$500 million from monsoon rainfall in  India  and Nepal. Economic
losses were at least $1.1 billion according to Impact, which
said more than 5,000 people were reported dead or missing.  Costs still trailed the first half of 2011 when there were
losses of about $55 billion due to events in  Australia ,  China ,
Colombia and the U.S., Bowen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
