Unusual share price movements in the
two days before takeovers announced in the U.K. fell for a third
straight year in a sign that a crackdown on  insider trading  has
been effective.  There were abnormal pre-announcement price movements before
14.9 percent of the 74 deal notices in the U.K. in the year that
ended on March 31, 2013,  Chris Hamilton , a spokesman for the
Financial Conduct Authority said today. The figure is down from
19.8 percent reported last year. The rate was as high as 30.6
percent in 2009.  Factors other than insider trading, such as analyst or
press speculation about an upcoming deal, or information leaks,
could be the cause of the share price movements, the regulator
has said. The FCA, formerly the Financial Services Authority,
has made insider trading a focus of its enforcement division.  “We welcome the decline,” said Patrick Spens, the FCA’s
head of market monitoring. “While it should be noted that this
fall has taken place against a background of reduced M&A
activity we are encouraged by the downwards trend of the last
three years which has taken place against the backdrop of our
increased focus on market abuse and market monitoring.”  The figures were published in the last annual report of the
FCA’s predecessor, the FSA, which was abolished on March 31.  To contact the reporter for this story:
