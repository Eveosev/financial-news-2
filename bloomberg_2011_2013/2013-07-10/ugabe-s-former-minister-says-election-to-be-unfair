Simba Makoni, who served as finance
minister under President  Robert Mugabe  before running against
the 89-year-old leader in 2008 elections, said a July 31 vote
will be unfair.  Problems with registering voters, biased coverage in the
state media and the threat of violence jeopardize the chance of
a free vote, Makoni said in an interview with Johannesburg’s
PowerFM radio station today. Makoni is now supporting Prime
Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai  and his Movement for Democratic
Change in the election.  “It’s a matter of record that there are problems that
militate against free and fair elections,” Makoni said. “We
fear the specter of violence and intimidation. There is an
uneven playing field in the media sector.”  Makoni is backing Tsvangirai as he attempts to win power to
end a 13-year political battle with Mugabe. Between 2000 and
2008 the two leaders fought a series of elections that were
marred by violence and irregularities, according to observers
including the European Union. The 15-nation  Southern African
Development Community  forced the two to form a coalition
government in 2009, ending a decade-long recession.  The economy still hasn’t recovered, said Makoni, who
entered Mugabe’s first government in 1980 as a deputy
agriculture minister, later serving in other posts.  “When shelves are full of imported goods and your own
factories are closing down” that’s not a recovery, he said.
