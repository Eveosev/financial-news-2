Palm oil retreated from a two-week
high as exports from  Malaysia  declined amid speculation that
demand may slow after the Ramadan season, boosting stockpiles
from a two-year low in the world’s second-largest producer.  The contract for September delivery dropped 0.8 percent to
end at 2,377 ringgit ($747) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives. Futures closed yesterday at the highest price for
the most-active contract since June 25. Palm for local physical
delivery in July was at 2,400 ringgit, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Shipments from Malaysia fell 16 percent to 352,375 tons in
the first 10 days of July, surveyor Intertek said today. Exports
dropped 16 percent in the same period, according to SGS
(Malaysia) Sdn. Inventories fell 9.4 percent to 1.65 million
tons in June from a month earlier, the lowest since March 2011,
data from the nation’s palm oil board showed today. Exports
climbed 0.3 percent to 1.41 million tons, while  output  rose 2.3
percent to 1.42 million tons.  “Exports won’t increase because it’s not a festive season
and there’s no seasonal demand,” said Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, a
director at Commtrendz Risk Management Services Pvt. in Mumbai.
“Once Ramadan is over, there is not going to be any demand at
all. There is going to be a huge crop in India because of the
good rains. These are all negative factors, which is why the
market is not excited about this particular news now.”  Ramadan Demand  Consumption increases during the Muslim fasting month of
Ramadan, which started this week, when observers break day-long
fasts with communal meals that raise total cooking oil demand.  Farmers in  India  have planted crops including rice,
oilseeds and cotton in 25.1 million hectares (62 million acres)
so far this year, 85 percent more than the same period a year
earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said June 28. The best start
to the monsoon in at least 12 years in India, the largest palm
oil buyer, may spur plantings, according to Shashanka Bhide, an
economist at the New Delhi-based National Council of Applied
Economic Research.  Soybean oil for delivery in December lost 0.3 percent to
45.85 cents on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans for
delivery in November gained 0.3 percent to $12.80 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for January delivery gained 0.2 percent to
close at 5,882  yuan  ($959) a ton on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange, while soybean oil for delivery in the same month
climbed 0.2 percent to end at 7,286 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
