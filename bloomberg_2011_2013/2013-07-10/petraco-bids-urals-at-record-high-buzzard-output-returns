Petraco SpA failed to buy Russian
Urals in the Mediterranean at the highest differential in more
than 20 years.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  sold  North Sea  Forties
crude at Monday’s five-month high.  Shipments of Azeri Light blend from  Georgia ’s Black Sea
port of Supsa for August will total four cargoes of 600,000
barrels each, one fewer than this month, according to a
preliminary loading schedule obtained by  Bloomberg News .  North Sea  Shell sold Forties F0719 for loading July 29 to July 31 at
a premium of 50 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, a Bloomberg
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing
window showed. That is the same as the price for a cargo it sold
July 8, which was the highest since Feb. 8.  Shell withdrew an offer for a Forties loading July 21 to
July 23 at a premium of 35 cents to Dated Brent.  There were no bids or offers for Brent, Oseberg or Ekofisk.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days fell 4 cents to a premium of 47 cents to Dated
Brent, after having reached a five-month high yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for August settlement traded at $108.21 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $107.58 in the previous session. The September
contract was at $107.41 at the same time today, a discount of 80
cents to August.  The U.K.’s largest oil field, Buzzard, is returning to full
production after falling below 100,000 barrels a day yesterday,
according to three people with knowledge of the matter who asked
not to be identified because the information is confidential.  The 200,000 barrel-a-day field is producing about 160,000
barrels, one of them said earlier today. Nexen Inc., which
operates the field, declined to comment. Buzzard is the largest
contributor to the Forties blend, which typically sets the price
of the Dated Brent benchmark.  Mediterranean/Urals  Eni SpA (ENI)  failed to sell 100,000 metric tons of Urals for
loading July 31 to Aug. 4 at 70 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent.  Petraco sought to buy 80,000 tons of Urals at a premium of
95 cents to Dated Brent for loading July 27 to July 31, but
failed to find a seller.  Urals in the Mediterranean rose by 2 cents to a premium of
77 cents a barrel to Dated Brent. That’s the highest since at
least July 1991, when Bloomberg started tracking the data. In
northwest Europe, the  grade  was at 47 cents a barrel more than
Dated Brent, compared with 45 cents yesterday.  Daily Azeri Light loadings from Supsa will be equal to
77,419 barrels a day in August, compared to 58,065 barrels a day
this month.  BP Plc (BP/)  operates the Baku-Supsa pipeline, which
carries the grade from the  Caspian Sea  to the  Black Sea .  Iraq  is restoring crude flows through the Kirkuk-Ceyhan
pipeline to normal levels of 325,000-350,000 barrels-a-day, said
the state-run North Oil Co. in a statement. Flows through the
pipeline have been intermittent since June 22.  West Africa  Nigerian benchmark Qua Iboe was steady at $2.50 a barrel
more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Indian state-run  PTT Pcl (PTT)  is seeking to buy as much as 1
million barrels of crude on behalf of  IRPC Pcl (IRPC) , a Thai refiner
and petrochemical maker, according to two traders with knowledge
of the tender. The crude is for delivery on Sept. 1 to Sept. 5
at Rayong, where IRPC operates a 215,000 barrel-a-day refinery.  Another Indian refiner, Bharat Petroleum Corp., is seeking
to buy crude for loading in early August, said two traders who
asked not to be identified because the information is
confidential. Potential sellers must offer grades today, with
price offers due tomorrow, they said. All offers must stay valid
until July 12, the traders said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
