Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) , Australia’s
largest investment bank, agreed to buy  ING Groep NV (INGA) ’s South
Korean investment management business to add 25.2 trillion won
($22 billion) of assets.  The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter and
won’t have a material impact on earnings, ING, the biggest Dutch
financial-services company, said in a statement today. Neither
company disclosed detailed terms.  Macquarie has been buying asset-management businesses from
the U.S. to Asia since the global financial crisis to generate
more predictable income as stock markets gyrate. The Sydney-based company said in a separate statement that today’s purchase
will make it the largest foreign asset manager in  South Korea .  “Asia is one of the key growth regions for us globally and
having a presence in  Korea  is an essential cornerstone for our
Asian strategy,” Axel Maier, head of Asian business at
Macquarie’s investment management unit, said in the statement.  Amsterdam-based ING, which agreed to sell its global
insurance and investment-management operations to win European
Union approval for bailouts in 2008 and 2009, has since sold
more than 25 assets for at least 20 billion euros ($26 billion).  ING said today it’s still planning to sell the rest of its
insurance and investment management businesses in Asia,
including ING Life Korea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
