Gasoline jumped to a three-month
high after a report showed that stockpiles of the motor fuel and
crude tumbled last week.  Futures advanced as much as 1.7 percent. The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute reported yesterday gasoline
supplies fell 3.5 million barrels and crude oil stockpiles
declined 9 million last week, according to a person familiar
with the data. The Energy Information Administration will report
today that gasoline supplies rose 1 million barrels, according
to the median of 11 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “This is on the back of the API stats showing a far more
than expected draw in crude oil inventories and an unexpected
draw in gasoline,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  August-delivery gasoline gained 4.02 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to $2.9662 a gallon at 9:45 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile

average. Prices touched $2.9766, the highest intraday price
since April 3.  West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery on the
Nymex rose $1.76 to $105.29 a barrel, after touching a 14-month
high of $105.62.  Crack Spreads  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI narrowed 7 cents to
$19.29 a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  over Brent jumped $1.11 to
$16.19.  The EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, is
scheduled to report last week’s inventories at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington .  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, rose 1.8 cents to $3.501
a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.
That’s the highest price since June 28 and biggest one-day
increase since May 17.  “It’s clear the recent price increases for crude oil are
beginning to reach consumers at the pump,” Michael Green, a
spokesman for AAA in Washington, said in a e-mail today.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel, or ULSD, for August delivery rose
1.41 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.9998 a gallon on trading
volume that was 20 percent below the 100-day average. Prices
touched $3.0043, the highest intraday price since April 4.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
fell $1.17 to $20.70 a barrel. The  premium over Brent  gained 1
cent to $17.60.  The EIA will probably report that distillate inventories
rose 1 million barrels, according to the survey. The API
reported an increase of 2.8 million barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
