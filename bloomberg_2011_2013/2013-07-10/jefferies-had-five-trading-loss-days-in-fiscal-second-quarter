Jefferies Group LLC had five daily
trading losses in the fiscal second quarter, fueled by its
investment in Knight Capital Group Inc., after reporting none in
the same period last year.  The biggest daily trading loss was $6 million to $8 million
in the three months ended May 31, Jefferies said today in a
regulatory filing. The firm would have had one daily loss
without its August 2012 investment in Knight. In the prior three
quarters combined, New York-based Jefferies said it had 18 daily
losses with Knight, compared with three excluding the holding.  Jefferies, which was acquired in March by  Leucadia National
Corp. (LUK) , saw a “significant slowdown” in fixed-income trading
during March and April amid uncertainty about the direction of
the Federal Reserve’s bond-buying program, Chief Executive
Officer  Richard Handler  said last month. Revenue from sales and
trading fell 13 percent to $358.8 million in the second quarter
from a year earlier, the company said at the time.  Average daily value-at-risk, a measure of potential trading
losses, was $8.77 million in the period ended May 31, according
to the filing, compared with $9.27 million in the preceding
quarter. Excluding the Knight investment, VaR was $5.77 million
in the second quarter of this year.  Jefferies helped arrange a $400 million bailout for  Jersey
City , New Jersey-based Knight after trading losses spurred by a
software failure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
