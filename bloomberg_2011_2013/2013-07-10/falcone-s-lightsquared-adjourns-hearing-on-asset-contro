Philip A. Falcone’s bankrupt
LightSquared Inc. delayed a hearing on control of its assets
without disclosing specifics of a dispute with an entity owned
by  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  Chairman  Charlie Ergen .  “After discussions with parties, we ask your honor to
adjourn today’s conference,” Matthew Barr, a lawyer for
LightSquared, told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman in
 Manhattan  today.  LightSquared had been scheduled to appear in court to
discuss whether it owed something to lenders under an agreement
reached in January that extended the wireless broadband
company’s control over the case until July 15.  Falcone’s Harbinger Capital Partners LLC is “trying
desperately” to keep ownership of LightSquared in the face of
debt buying by Ergen’s SP Special Opportunities LLC fund, at the
expense of creditors, lenders said in court papers filed
yesterday. The Ergen fund joined the lender group on June 13.  The lenders also have said LightSquared hasn’t acted on a
$2 billion bid from Ergen’s L-Band Acquisition Corp. and can’t
get regulatory approval or enough financing to exit bankruptcy
on its own.  LightSquared, based in Reston,  Virginia , has shown that it
“will not entertain any resolution of the case that threatens
Harbinger’s ownership,” the lenders said.  LightSquared’s obligation to the lenders was blacked out in
court documents. LightSquared said it shouldn’t be bound to the
obligation because, following the Ergen fund’s purchases, a
large portion of its debt is now owned by an entity controlled
by an individual who competes with LightSquared.  The case is In re LightSquared Inc., 12-bk-12080,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
