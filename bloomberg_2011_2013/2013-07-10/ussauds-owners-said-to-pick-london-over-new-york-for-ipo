The private-equity firms that own
Merlin Entertainments Group Ltd. plan to take the theme park
operator public in  London  next year, after deciding against an
offering in New York, people with knowledge of the talks said.  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , CVC Capital Partners Ltd. and Kirkbi
A/S decided last month to proceed with an initial public
offering in London after talks with Merlin’s managers, said the
people, who asked not be identified because the talks are
private.  Merlin, which runs the London Eye and Madame Tussauds, may
sell shares to the public in the first quarter of 2014 in an IPO
that may value the Poole, England-based company at more than 3
billion pounds ($4.5 billion), the people said. The owners,
which each hold about a third of the company, hired  Barclays
Plc (BARC) , Citigroup Inc.,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  Morgan Stanley
& Co. (MS)  to manage the offering, the people added.  Spokesmen for Blackstone, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan
Stanley and Merlin declined to comment. Spokesman for CVC and
Kirkbi didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.  Merlin’s operating profit rose 17 percent to 258 million
pounds in 2012, the company said in May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
