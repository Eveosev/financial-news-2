Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ALXN) , a
maker of a drug for rare blood diseases, rose to its highest
price in six weeks after an analyst recommended buying the stock
ahead of the company’s second-quarter earnings report.  Alexion  gained  4.6 percent to $100.12 at the close in New
York, its highest price since May 30. The shares of the
Cheshire, Connecticut-based drugmaker have gained 6.8 percent
this year.  That increase trails the 35 percent boost in the Nasdaq
Biotechnology Index, prompting Christopher Raymond, an analyst
with Robert W. Baird & Co., to recommend buying Alexion in a
research note yesterday. Alexion has been expanding use of its
drug Soliris and the growth should continue this year, Raymond
said today in a telephone interview.  “This is a name that’s been a victim of a little bit too
much anxiety over 2013 numbers,” Raymond said. “We’re thinking
there’s upside in the near term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
