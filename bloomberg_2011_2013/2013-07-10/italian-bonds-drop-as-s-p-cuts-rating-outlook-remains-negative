Italian 10-year government bonds
declined for a second day after the nation’s rating was lowered
by  Standard & Poor’s  because expectations for a weakening in
economic prospects and the country’s impaired financial system.  Yields (GBTPGR10)  on the Italy’s debt securities maturing in May 2023
increased seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 4.48
percent at 7:27 a.m. London time. Two-year rates jumped five
basis points to 1.58 percent.  S&P cut the rating to BBB, or two levels above junk, and
said today in a statement that the outlook remains negative.  To contact the reporter on this story:
