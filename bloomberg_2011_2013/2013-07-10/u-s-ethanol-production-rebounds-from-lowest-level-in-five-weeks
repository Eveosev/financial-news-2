Ethanol production in the U.S. rose
2.1 percent to 881,000 barrels a day last week, rebounding from
a five-week low, the Energy Information Administration said in a
report today.  Output was 7.3 percent higher than a year earlier.
Stockpiles grew 1.8 percent to 15.7 million barrels from a
record low the previous week, said the EIA, the Energy
Departmentâ€™s research arm.  The U.S.  imported  25,000 barrels a day of the fuel,
compared with none the previous week. Foreign purchases have
averaged 19,000 barrels a day this year, up from 8,000 during
the same period in 2012, EIA data show.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 91 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool, down from about 94 percent and the lowest
level since May 31, according to the report.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery increased 0.4 cent to
$2.43 a gallon at 11:28  New York  time on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices are up 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
