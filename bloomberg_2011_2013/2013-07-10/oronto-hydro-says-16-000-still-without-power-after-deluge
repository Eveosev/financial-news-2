About 16,000 customers remain
without electricity in west Toronto, two days after record
rainfall flooded local power stations, according to Toronto
Hydro-Electric System Ltd.  A July 8 storm brought almost 100 millimeters (3.9 inches)
of rain to  Canada ’s most populous city, the heaviest one-day
rainfall since records began in 1937, flooding train tracks,
subway lines and roadways during the evening commute and
knocking out power to 300,000 residents.  “The main issue is related to a lack of supply to these
customers from Hydro One’s Manby and Richview stations due to
flooding,” Toronto Hydro said today in a statement. Customers
served out of Richview Station were restored around 3 p.m.
yesterday.  Manby Station, one of two main supply points in Toronto’s
downtown, remains out, Toronto Hydro said. Toronto Hydro said it
may resume rotating power outages this morning as it
reconfigures the electrical system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
