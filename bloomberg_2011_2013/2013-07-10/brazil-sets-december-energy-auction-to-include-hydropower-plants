Energy developers in  Brazil  will bid
for contracts to sell electricity Dec. 13 from plants due to go
into operation in five years, including a 700-megawatt
hydropower project in the Amazon.  Companies planning hydro projects will bid for 30-year
contracts in the so-called A-5 auction, according to a notice
today in Brazil’s official  gazette . Companies developing
projects that run on coal, natural gas and biomass will bid for
25-year contracts.  This will be the second A-5 auction this year. The
government will hold a similar event Aug. 23 and organized the
December one to provide additional time for agencies to issue
environmental licenses for hydropower plants including the  Sao
Manoel  project on the Teles Pires river in Mato Grosso state,
according to a spokesman for the national energy regulator. The
Empresa de Pesquisa Energetica official asked not be identified
because of the organization’s policy.  The country held one A-5 auction last year, and
participants won contracts to sell power from 574.3 megawatts of
capacity including two hydro plants, the regulator said on its
 website .  Companies that win contracts in the December event must
start producing power by Jan. 1, 2018.  To contact the reporter on this story:
