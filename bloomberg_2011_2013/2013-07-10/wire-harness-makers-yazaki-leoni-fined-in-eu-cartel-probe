Yazaki Corp., the world’s biggest
maker of automotive wire harnesses,  Leoni AG (LEO) , and two other
companies were fined a total of 141 million euros ($180 million)
in a European Union probe into a series of price-fixing cartels.  Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. was not fined for its
involvement because it had told the European Commission about
the five cartels. The other companies had their fines reduced by
10 percent because they agreed to settle the case with the EU
regulator, it said today.  The “decision shows the first results in the commission’s
wider investigative effort to detect and sanction any illegal
cartels in markets for car parts,” EU Competition Commissioner
 Joaquin Almunia  said in an e-mailed statement. “Such cartels
may harm the competitiveness of the automotive industry and
artificially inflate prices for final buyers of cars.”  The EU probe, which is part of a wider crackdown on price
fixing in the auto-parts industry, follows raids the authority
had previously done at makers of wire harnesses, car safety
systems, bearings and thermal systems. The Brussels-based EU
watchdog can fine companies as much as 10 percent of yearly
sales or require them to change the way they do business if it
concludes that they harmed competition.  Yazaki received the biggest fine of 125.3 million euros.
Furukawa Electric Co. was fined 4 million euros, S-Y Systems
Technologies 11.05 million euros and Leoni 1.3 million euros.
