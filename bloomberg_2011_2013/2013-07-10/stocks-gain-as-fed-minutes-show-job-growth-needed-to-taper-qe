U.S. stocks erased losses as minutes
from the  Federal Reserve ’s last meeting showed many officials
want to see further progress in the employment market before the
central bank slows the pace of bond purchases.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.2 percent to
1,656.25 at 2:03 p.m. in New York after slipping as much as 0.3
percent earlier.  “Many members indicated that further improvement in the
outlook for the labor market would be required before it would
be appropriate to slow the pace of asset purchases,” according
to the record of the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s June 18-19
gathering released today in  Washington .  Today’s minutes noted that “several members judged that a
reduction in asset purchases would likely soon be warranted.”
Those members said the “cumulative decline in unemployment
since the September meeting and ongoing increases in private
payrolls” had increased their confidence that the labor market
had improved, the minutes showed.  The  S&P 500  closed about 1 percent below its record high
yesterday amid optimism about the second-quarter earnings
season. Yum! Brands Inc. reports earnings today, while JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and  Wells Fargo & Co . are among companies releasing
results this week.  The U.S. benchmark has recovered following a 4.8 percent
drop between June 19 and 24, triggered when Bernanke said the
central bank may reduce its $85 billion of monthly bond-buying
this year and end the program in 2014 as economic risks subside.
The index is up 16 percent for the year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
