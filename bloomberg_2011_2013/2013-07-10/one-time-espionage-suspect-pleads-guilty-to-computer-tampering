An ex- Medical College of Wisconsin 
researcher once suspected of trying to steal a developmental
cancer-fighting compound for  China  pleaded guilty to a computer
tampering charge.  Hua Jun Zhao, a Chinese national, was arrested in March on
suspicion he had taken three vials of the cancer drug from a
Medical College office in  Milwaukee  and then took steps to
deliver them to China’s Zhejiang University. Initially charged
with economic espionage, he was indicted on April 9 for computer
tampering and lying to federal agents.  “As you gather facts, your view of a situation sometimes
changes,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Ingraham told
reporters today after Zhao pleaded before U.S. District Judge
Charles N. Clevert in Milwaukee.  The three vials were never found, he said.  “Of course we’d like to resolve that,” Ingraham said. The
missing vials, containing a powdery substance identified only as
C-25, had a value of about $8,000 according to court papers
filed when Zhao was arrested.  Zhao, who told Clevert he is 41, is scheduled to be
sentenced on Aug. 6. While his crime is punishable by as long as
five years in imprison, the prosecutor said outside court the
sentence imposed is likely to be less than that.  Zhao’s lawyer, Michelle Jacobs, declined to comment after
her client entered his guilty plea.  The case is U.S. v. Zhao, 13-cr-00058, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of  Wisconsin  (Milwaukee).  To contact the reporter on this story:
