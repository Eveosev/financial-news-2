A fund managed by  Morgan Stanley (MS) 
will team with U.K. homebuilder  Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV)  and
construct 770 homes to revive a former London industrial site by
the  River Thames .  The project in the borough of Greenwich will have a gross
development value of about 275 million pounds ($410 million),
Barratt, the second-biggest U.K. homebuilder by market value,
said in a statement today. Morgan Stanley’s real estate
investing unit will also build a cruise terminal, a 250-room
hotel and a commercial building on the site with developer West
Properties, according to the statement.  U.K. homebuilders are developing disused sites on the banks
of the Thames in east London to gain from demand for river views
from workers seeking to live near the Canary Wharf and City of
London financial districts. News Corp.’s News International
unit, publisher of the Sun and London-based Times newspapers,
sold its former headquarters in London’s Wapping district to
homebuilder  Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG)  in May 2012.  The 8.9-acre (3.6-hectare) site at Greenwich is close to
the O2 Arena, a concert venue that was used for the 2012  Olympic
Games .  Barratt’s fiscal 2013 profit before items beat analyst
estimates as government support for buyers helped the company
exceed sales targets, the company said today in a separate
statement. Pretax profit before taxes and one-time items was
about 192 million pounds in the 12 months through June, the
company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
