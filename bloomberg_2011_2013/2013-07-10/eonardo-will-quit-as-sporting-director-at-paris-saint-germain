Former Brazilian World Cup winner
Leonardo will resign as sporting director of Paris Saint-Germain
after the completion of this season’s transfer period, the
French soccer team said.  “We regret his choice but respect his decision,” the club
said in an e-mailed statement. “We thank him greatly for his
important contributions towards the project of building a top
European Club in Paris and wish him all the best for his future
career choice.”  Last week, the French Football Federation imposed a 13-month touchline ban on Leonardo for shoving a referee during a
match last season.  Leonardo, a former PSG player, is the latest departure from
the Qatar-owned club after Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti, who
left to take over Real Madrid after leading the French team to
the national title last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
