NTPC Ltd. (NTPC) ,  India ’s largest
electricity generator, has begun construction of a third solar
power plant to help mitigate the risk of fuel shortages faced by
its coal-fired projects.  The utility awarded the contract to build the 5-megawatt
plant at Jhajru village in the northern state of Haryana to
Eversun Energy Pvt., NTPC said in an e-mailed statement. Enmas
GP Power System Projects Ltd. will connect the plant to the
grid.  NTPC, which has completed a 5 megawatt solar plant at Dadri
in Uttar Pradesh state and another of similar capacity at Port
Blair in the Andaman & Nicobar islands, has an additional 85
megawatts under construction. The plants will help NTPC broaden
its generation mix “to ensure long-run competitiveness and
mitigate fuel risks,” according to the statement.  NTPC, which has 41,000 megawatts of mostly coal-fired
capacity, has been forced to increase its purchases of expensive
coal imports due to domestic fuel shortages. The utility plans
to develop 1,000 megawatts of renewables by 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
