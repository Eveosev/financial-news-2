Indonesia ’s bonds fell, pushing the
10-year yield to the highest since March 2011, on speculation
the central bank will raise borrowing costs for a second month.
The rupiah dropped to the weakest level since September 2009.  Bank Indonesia will increase its  reference rate  to 6.25
percent tomorrow, from 6 percent, according to 11 of 15 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Two predict no change, while two forecast
a 50 basis point boost. Foreign-currency  reserves  fell to $98.1
billion in June, the least in more than two years, official data
show, reducing the central bank’s scope to support the currency
by intervention. Indonesia raised fuel prices last month, which
is expected to spur consumer prices in July,  “There will be more spikes in inflation in the coming
months, particularly in July, which could add to their impetus
to hike more aggressively,” said  Euben Paracuelles , an
economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in  Singapore . “The forex
reserves data could be seen more as a concern that adds more
currency weakness.” Nomura is forecasting a 50 basis point
increase in the reference rate.  The yield on the 5.625 percent government bonds due May
2023 climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8
percent as of 9:37 a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association. It touched 8.01 percent earlier,
the highest level since March 2011, and has risen 87 basis
points this month.  Consumer prices gained 5.9 percent last month, compared
with 5.47 percent in May, official data show. That exceeds the
central bank’s target for 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent this year.  The rupiah declined 0.1 percent to 9,963 per dollar after
touching 9,966, weakest level since September 2009, prices from
local banks show. The currency will trade at 9,950 at year-end,
Paracuelles said. It is at a 2.2 percent premium to the one-month non-deliverable forwards, which gained 0.3 percent to
10,183, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  One-month implied volatility for the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
dropped 28 basis points to 13.04 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
