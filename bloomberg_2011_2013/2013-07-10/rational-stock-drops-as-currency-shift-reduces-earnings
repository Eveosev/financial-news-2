Rational AG (RAA) , the supplier of
automated cookers for Queen Elizabeth II’s Buckingham Palace
kitchen, fell the most in almost five years after shifts in
exchange rates dragged first-half profit down 6 percent.  Rational  plunged  as much as 18 percent to 202.60 euros, the
steepest intraday drop since October 2008, and was trading 16
percent lower at 10:51 a.m. in  Frankfurt , valuing the stovemaker
at 2.34 billion euros ($3.01 billion). Volume exceeded five
times the three-month daily average.  Earnings before interest and taxes in the period probably
fell to 50.5 million euros from 53.7 million euros a year
earlier, the Landsberg am Lech, Germany-based company said in a
statement today. Sales declined 0.7 percent to 106.8 million
euros. Detailed figures will be published in August. Drops in
the yen and the pound against the euro hurt sales the most,
Chief Executive Officer Guenter Blaschke said.  “The currency effect is somewhat stronger than we had
expected,” Blaschke said in a telephone interview. “We lost
about 2 percent of growth in the first year through currency
alone, about 3.2 million euros in sales. That’s above all
because of the yen.”  Fluctuations in the value of the Japanese and mainland
European currencies cut 2 million euros from sales, with the
pound-euro shift reducing revenue by another 800,000 euros and
moves by the Brazilian real lowering the figure by another
400,000 euros, Blaschke said.  Rational, which has been investing to expand sales and
distribution networks in Europe as it anticipates a recovery
from the region’s sovereign debt crisis, said it expects full-year profit to remain at last year’s level, while sales will
grow around 5 percent.  “We are investing structurally in growth and operations,
so our costs are increasing,” Blaschke said. “We are now
investing in growth everywhere.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
