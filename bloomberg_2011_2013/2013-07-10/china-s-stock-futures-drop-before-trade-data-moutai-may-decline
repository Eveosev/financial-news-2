China’s stocks  rallied the most in
three months, led by financial and commodity companies, on
speculation the government will take measures to support
economic growth after an unexpected drop in exports.  Ping An Bank Co. and Industrial Bank Co. rose more than 3
percent. Yanzhou  China  Coal Energy Co. jumped 10 percent, while
Jiangxi Copper Co., the largest copper producer, surged the most
since January.  China Merchants Property Development Co. (000024) , the
third-biggest developer, rose 8.9 percent after the company said
profit probably more than doubled in the first six months.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  gained 2.2 percent to 2,008.13
at the close, the biggest advance since March 20. The measure
briefly retreated this morning after a government report showed
exports fell 3.1 percent in June while imports slid 0.7 percent.
The CSI 300 Index rose 2.8 percent to 2,224.06. The  Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  added 1.9 percent.  “There’s some speculation about a cut in the reserve-requirement ratio and that’s probably behind the rally in
cyclical stocks such as commodity and coal shares,” said  Wang Zheng , Shanghai-based chief investment officer at Jingxi
Investment Management Co., which manages $120 million. The odds
of any policy loosening including a cut in the reserve ratio
“are not that high,” he said.  The People’s Bank of China didn’t immediately respond to
faxed questions seeking comment. The last time the central bank
lowered the reserve ratio was in May 2012. A “benign”
inflation outlook leaves room for fine-tuning measures to avoid
a hard landing for the economy, Sun Junwei and Qu Hongbin,
economists at HSBC Holdings Plc, wrote in a note today. More
fiscal spending and a 25 basis-point cut in  interest rates  are
likely options in coming months, they wrote.  Export Data  The  Shanghai  measure has fallen 12 percent this year as
data from industrial production to exports pointed to a
sustained slowdown in the economy and as money-market rates
reached record highs last month. The index trades at 8.2 times
12-month projected profit after valuations fell in June to the
lowest level in at least five years,  data  compiled by Bloomberg
show. Trading volumes today were 5 percent lower than the 30-day
average.  Ping An Bank gained 4.4 percent to 9.40  yuan . Industrial
Bank, part-owned by a unit of HSBC Holdings Plc, rose 3.5
percent to 9.45 yuan.  China Minsheng Banking Corp. (600016) , the first
privately owned bank, added 2.4 percent to 8.60 yuan.  Developers’ Earnings  The Shanghai Composite property index surged 4.5 percent
today. China Merchants Property climbed 8.9 percent to 26.80
yuan. First-half profit may have jumped between 105 percent and
113 percent from a year earlier, the developer said in an
exchange statement.  China Vanke Co. (000002) , the nation’s biggest listed
property developer, gained 6.4 percent to 10.28 yuan.  Chinese companies are scheduled to report first-half
earnings from this month. UBS AG yesterday cut its earnings
growth estimate to 8.7 percent for this year from the previous
forecast of 11.5 percent.  Measures of material and energy stocks in the CSI 300
advanced 4.1 percent and 3.8 percent respectively. Yanzhou Coal,
China’s fourth-biggest coal miner, surged by the maximum daily
limit to 9.88 yuan. Jiangxi Copper, the nation’s biggest
producer of the metal, advanced 5.4 percent to 16.30 yuan.  Inner
Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co. (600111) , China’s biggest
producer of rare earth, jumped 10 percent to 23.24 yuan.  The decline in June exports compared with a 1 percent
increase in the previous month and last year’s average monthly
growth of 8.3 percent. The trade report follows May’s collapse
in export gains after a crackdown on fake invoices that inflated
data in the first four months of the year. The government’s
annual target of trade growth is 8 percent.  Prudent Policy  A report from the statistics bureau yesterday showed
consumer prices rose a higher-than-forecast 2.7 percent last
month while producer prices fell 2.7 percent for its longest
declining streak in a decade.  President  Xi Jinping  was cited by the Xinhua News Agency on
June 29 as saying that officials shouldn’t be judged solely on
their record in boosting gross domestic product, signaling a
willingness of the nation’s leaders to tolerate slower
expansion. The central bank will continue to implement a prudent
monetary policy, governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  said at the annual
Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai last month.  Money-market rates dropped for a 14th day, the longest run
of declines in at least seven years, as the central bank
refrained from draining funds from the financial system, easing
a cash squeeze.  The 30-day  volatility  in the Shanghai Composite was at 24.2
today, the highest since February last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index, the
measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added
0.9 percent in  New York  yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
