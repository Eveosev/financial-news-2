Technicolor SA (TCH) , a Paris-listed media
technology company, extended the deadline in its offer to buy
back bonds as it seeks to refinance about 1.2 billion euros
($1.5 billion) of loans and notes.  Bondholders have until 6 p.m.  New York  time tomorrow to
tender their securities, according to a statement from the
company. Investors had already agreed to sell back about 99
percent of the notes. The company also offered to purchase its
senior, secured loans and lenders holding 61 percent of the
facilities agreed to the deal.  The company, which was known as Thomson SA until it was
restructured in 2009, plans to obtain a new loan to fund the
tender offers, a person familiar with situation said July 8. The
refinancing will close in a few days, the company said in the
statement today.  Technicolor is buying back the debt and will raise the new
financing though its Tech Finance SCA unit, according to a June
11 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
