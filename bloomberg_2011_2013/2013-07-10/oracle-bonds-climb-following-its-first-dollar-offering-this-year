Bonds of  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  rose a day
after the largest maker of  database software  raised $3 billion
in a three-part offering, its first dollar-denominated sale this
year.  Oracle’s $1 billion of 3.625 percent, 10-year notes have
climbed 1.41 cents from yesterday’s issue price to 100.509 cents
on the dollar to yield 3.564 percent as of 9:31 a.m. in New
York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The extra yield investors demand to own the notes rather
than similar-maturity Treasuries narrowed to 93.1 basis points
from an initial spread of 110, Trace data show. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  Redwood City , California-based Oracle’s $1.5 billion of
2.375 percent debt due January 2019 rose 0.53 cent from the
issue price to 100.185 cents on the dollar to yield 2.339
percent, Trace data show. Its $500 million of floating-rate
securities issued at par and due January 2019 were trading at
100.436 cents on the dollar.  Oracle last sold dollar debt in October, raising $2.5
billion each of 1.2 percent, five-year securities and 2.5
percent, 10-year debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
