Seguros Colpatria SA, a Colombian
insurance provider, is weighing a sale that may fetch $500
million, said people familiar with the matter.  Seguros Colpatria, which provides fire, earthquake,
liability and other types of coverage, engaged Zurich-based UBS
AG to seek a buyer, according to the people, who asked not to be
named because the matter is private. Companies including  Ace
Ltd. (ACE) ,  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  and  MetLife Inc. (MET)  may be
interested, said the people.  The potential sale comes as diversified insurance firms in
the U.S. and Europe seek acquisitions in developing regions such
as Latin America to help make up for slowing growth at home.
Ace, based in Zurich, this year acquired Mexican insurance
assets from Ally Financial Inc., while MetLife agreed in
February to buy a Chilean pension manager from Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA.  Officials at Bogota-based Seguros Colpatria didn’t respond
to requests for comment. Spokesmen at UBS, Ace and Newark, New
Jersey-based Prudential declined to comment, while a
representative for New York-based MetLife didn’t respond to
requests for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
