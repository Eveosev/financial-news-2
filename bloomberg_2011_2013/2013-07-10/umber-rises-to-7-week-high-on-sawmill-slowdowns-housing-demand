Lumber futures rallied to a seven-week high on speculation that North American mills are slowing
output as demand increases from home builders in the U.S. and
 China .  Some sawmills announced plans in June and July to reduce
output, while exports from the U.S. jumped 7 percent in May from
April, including a 34 percent increase to China, according to
Hakan Ekstrom, the president of industry researcher Wood
Resources International. U.S. builders started work on new homes
at a 914,000 annual rate in May, up 29 percent from a year
earlier, government data show.  “Inventories are down through the system, and housing
starts are increasing, so buyers and consumers of lumber want to
make sure they have enough wood,” Ekstrom said in a telephone
interview from  Seattle .  Lumber futures for delivery in September rose 2.7 percent
to close at $319.20 per 1,000 board feet at 2:05 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the commodity rallied by
the $10 exchange limit to $320.70, the highest for a most-active
contract since May 21. Prices have rallied 16 percent since
touching a seven-month low of $276.20 on May 30.  Futures are down from an eight-year high of $411.50 on
March 14, partly because North American sawmills expanded output
after a 44 percent rally in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
