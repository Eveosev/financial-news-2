HelioVolt Corp., a closely held
thin-film solar panel maker, received about $12.2 million to
expand production.  The financing was provided “mainly” by existing investors
including New Enterprise Associates Inc. and SK Innovation Co.,
Rick Yang, an NEA senior associate, said today by telephone.
HelioVolt, based in Austin,  Texas , began commercial
manufacturing in 2008, and the funding will be used to increase
production and develop new products, he said.  “The existing investors in the company are seeing a lot of
good things happening, and we want to continue the momentum and
capitalize on that,” Yang said.  SK,  South Korea ’s biggest refiner invested $50 million in
the company’s $85 million  Series C  financing round last year.  HelioVolt disclosed today’s investment in a filing. Chief
Financial Officer Steve Darnell didn’t return a phone message
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
