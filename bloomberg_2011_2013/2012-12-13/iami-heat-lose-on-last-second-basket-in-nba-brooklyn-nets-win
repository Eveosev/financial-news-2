Draymond Green scored on a layup in
the final second to give the Golden State Warriors a 97-95
National Basketball Association win at the defending-champion
Miami Heat, who didn’t score in the game’s final three minutes.  Klay Thompson had 27 points to lead the Warriors (15-7),
who have won the first five games of a seven-game road trip.
LeBron James had 31 points for Miami (14-6), which fell 1 1/2
games behind the New York Knicks for the best record in the
Eastern Conference.  The Knicks (16-5) host the Los Angeles Lakers tonight at
Madison Square Garden.  Also last night, the Brooklyn Nets broke a five-game losing
streak with a 94-88 win at the  Toronto Raptors .  Joe Johnson  had
23 points to lead Brooklyn (12-9), which was missing leading
scorer Brook Lopez for the seventh straight game because of a
sprained right foot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
