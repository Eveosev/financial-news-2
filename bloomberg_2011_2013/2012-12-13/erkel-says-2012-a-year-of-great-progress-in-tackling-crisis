German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
this year has been marked by “great progress” toward solving
 Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis.  “At the end of the year 2012 I want to say that we have
achieved a lot,” Merkel told reporters in Brussels today before
a meeting of European Union leaders. “It was a very laborious
year, but it was also a year in which we made great progress,”
she said, citing the establishment of the euro area’s permanent
financial backstop and a pact on budgetary discipline.  The chancellor said the two-day meeting of heads of state
and government will focus on ways to strengthen economic
coordination in Europe, with leaders also aiming to agree on a
timetable for their work in coming months.  Finance ministers earlier today reached an agreement on
making the European  Central bank  the chief supervisor for euro-
area banks, a move that paves the way for direct
recapitalization of banks by the the European Stability
Mechanism. Merkel said that’s “a great step toward more
reliability and confidence in the  euro zone .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
