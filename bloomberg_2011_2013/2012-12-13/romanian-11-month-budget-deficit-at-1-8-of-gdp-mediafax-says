Romania â€™s January-November budget
deficit widened to 1.8 percent of  gross domestic product 
compared with a 10-month shortfall of 1.2 percent,  Mediafax 
reported today, citing unidentified government officials.  That compares with a deficit of 2.98 percent of GDP in the
same period of last year, according to the Bucharest-based news
service. Romania pledged to the International Monetary Fund and
the European Union to reduce its budget gap to 2.2 percent of
GDP in 2012 and 1.7 percent in 2013, compared with a deficit of
4.3 percent in 2011, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
