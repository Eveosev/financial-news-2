Polish power for next year advanced
for a third day as JPMorgan Chase & Co. said the contract would
advance from current levels amid recovering demand.  Polish electricity for next year advanced 0.3 percent to
170.10 zloty ($54.36) a megawatt-hour, broker data on Bloomberg
showed. The contract fell to 167.20 zloty a megawatt-hour on
Dec. 10, its lowest level since at least June 2008.  The country’s power demand may fall by 1 percent this year
as the economy slows and grow by 2 to 2.5 percent annually in
the following years, Javier Garrido, a JPMorgan analyst in
 Madrid , said in a research note today.  “Polish demand should be further fueled by the gradual
replacement of domestic coal with electricity and in the future
gas for heating purposes, driven in our view by rising gross
domestic product per capita and growing Silesian coal prices,”
the analysts said. The bank expects the contract will average
180 zloty a megawatt-hour next year amid falling coal
inventories.  The Polish day-ahead contract declined 12 percent to 189.31
zloty a megawatt-hour as the nation was set to become a net
importer during peak afternoon hours tomorrow, getting 373
megawatts of power from neighbors from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. That
compares with net exports of 400 megawatts at the same time
today.  Day-ahead electricity on the coupled market of the  Czech
Republic , Slovakia and  Hungary  plunged 25 percent, according to
the countries’ market operators. The contract settled at 50.75
euros ($66.38) a megawatt-hour in the Czech Republic and at
51.21 euros in Hungary and Slovakia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
