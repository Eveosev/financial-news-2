State Oil Co. of  Azerbaijan ’s crude
oil output declined in the first 11 months from a year earlier
as production fell at a BP Plc-led field in the  Caspian Sea .  The Baku-based producer known as Socar pumped out 7.56
million metric tons of oil in January through November, down 2.1
percent from a year earlier, according to data published late
yesterday on the company’s  website .  Output at the BP-led Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field, where
Socar is a partner and which provided 78 percent of Azerbaijan’s
oil output last year, slumped 12 percent in the first half. BP
added engineers and pledged to keep output stable after Azeri
President  Ilham Aliyev  criticized the U.K. producer in October.  Socar raised natural gas production 5.9 percent to 6.87
billion cubic meters in the first 11 months, the data showed.  Azerbaijan, the third-largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union , cut output about 7.4 percent during the period to
39.3 million tons, according to Socar’s data. Gas output grew 12
percent to 26.58 billion cubic meters during the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
