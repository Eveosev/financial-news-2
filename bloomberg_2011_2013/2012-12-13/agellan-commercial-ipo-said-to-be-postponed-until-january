Investment Trust (0623351D)  is postponing its initial public offering until
January, according to two people with knowledge of the
transaction.  The people asked not to be named because the details

($156.4 million) by selling units yielding 6.5 percent to 7
percent for C$10 each in an IPO that was slated to be priced
today, according to sale documents.  Derek Dermott, president of Agellan, declined to comment on
the company’s IPO plans.  The Toronto-based company was formed to own and operate
