VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY) , the largest
maker of credit-card terminals, is moving away from competing
directly with Square Inc. in mobile payments, according to  David
Talach , VeriFone’s vice president of industry engagement.  Instead of promoting its  SAIL attachment , which lets
smartphones accept debit and credit card payments, to merchants,
VeriFone will offer the tool to banks for them to resell to
their business customers. VeriFone said today that some assets
related to SAIL will be divested and that it’s “exploring
opportunities with potential third parties.”  San Jose , California-based Verifone introduced its SAIL
brand earlier this year, challenging Square,  EBay Inc. (EBAY) ’s PayPal
and other providers in a market expected to grow to $1 billion
in 2016 from $30 million last year, according to Aite Group LLC.
Given the lack of robust growth, selling through financial
institutions makes more sense, Talach said.  “We had good uptake, but I wouldn’t say it blew our socks
off,” Talach said. “We are morphing SAIL, pivoting to a
channel alliance strategy.”  VeriFone will continue to add new features to SAIL, and
will not stop offering it to merchants directly, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
