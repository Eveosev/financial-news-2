European Central Bank Executive
Board member Benoit Coeure said the ECB’s bond-purchase program
will improve financing conditions for the private sector.  “Recent evidence supports the view that the sovereign debt
crisis has had a negative impact on the supply of bank credit,”
Coeure said in a speech in  Frankfurt  today. The bond-buying
plan, dubbed Outright Monetary Transactions, will “contribute
to restoring access to finance for the private sector,” he
said.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said in July the ECB will do
whatever it takes to save the euro and announced the OMT program
in September. Investors are now waiting for countries like  Spain 
to seek aid from Europe’s rescue fund and sign up to conditions
to trigger ECB debt-market interventions.  Just the “mere announcement” of the OMT has “already
helped to ease uncertainty in the system,” Coeure said. “The
effect on confidence, a key factor for growth, has also been
significant, and rightly so.”  Referring to the ECB’s liquidity policies, such as fixed-
rate full-allotment refinancing operations and three-year loans
to banks, Coeure said research suggests they’ve had “a
significant economic effect, in that the level of industrial
production is 2 percent higher and the  unemployment rate  0.6
percent lower relative to a scenario with no such non-standard
measures.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
