Venezuela â€™s opposition alliance will
probably choose Henrique Capriles Radonski as its presidential
candidate should elections be called soon, provided he wins re-
election as governor of Miranda state on Dec. 16, Ultimas
Noticias reported, citing opposition officials.  If Capriles loses to government candidate Elias Jaua in the
vote for governor, the opposition alliance would consider a
different candidate in the event of a presidential election,
said Pedro Benitez and Simon Calzadilla, according to the
Caracas-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
