Treasuries fell for a third day
after initial claims for  unemployment benefits  in the U.S.
declined more than forecast and retail sales increased, adding
to signs of resilience in the world’s largest economy.  Bonds pared losses as safety demand rose after U.S. House
Speaker  John Boehner  said President  Barack Obama  isn’t serious
about resolving a budget showdown. Yields on 30-year securities
earlier reached the highest level in almost six weeks before the
U.S. auctions $13 billion of the debt. The  Federal Reserve  said
yesterday it plans to buy $45 billion of U.S. government
securities each month from January and took the unprecedented
step of linking stimulus measures to unemployment and inflation.  “It was a good set of data,” said  Tom Porcelli , chief
U.S. economist in  New York  at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital
Markets unit, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed.
“It appears the labor market got a little bit of a boost in
November. Combine that with a better sales outcome, and the
Treasury market reaction is appropriate.”  The 30-year bond  yield  increased two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.91 percent at 11:58 a.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched 2.93
percent earlier, the highest level since Nov. 2. The price of
the 2.75 percent security maturing in November 2042 fell 10/32,
or $3.13 per $1,000 face amount, to 96 29/32.  The benchmark  10-year yield  rose three basis points to 1.73
percent after touching 1.74 percent, the most since Nov. 7.  Renewed Pessimism  Treasuries trimmed gains as U.S. lawmakers from both
parties expressed renewed pessimism about the prospects of
reaching a budget deal before more than $600 billion automatic
in tax increases and spending cuts start taking effect in
January. The  Congressional Budget Office  has said if nothing
changes, the stalemate probably would lead to a recession.  Boehner, in a prepared text for a news conference, said
Obama’s proposals have been “anything but” a balanced approach.  The 30-year bonds scheduled for sale today yielded 2.910
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 2.82 percent at
the previous offering of the securities on Nov. 8.  Investors bid for 2.77 times the amount of debt available
last month, the  most  this year. Indirect bidders, a category
that includes foreign central banks, bought 45.4 percent of the
bonds, the most since April 2011.  The Treasury auctioned $21 billion in 10-year notes
yesterday, drawing a yield of 1.652 percent, the lowest since
July, and $32 billion in three-year securities the previous day
at a record-low yield of 0.327 percent.  Auction Schedule  The department said today it will sell next week $35
billion in two-year debt, an equal amount of five-year
securities, $29 billion in seven-year notes and $14 billion in
inflation indexed securities. The auctions will be on four
consecutive days beginning Dec. 17.  Treasury trading volume rose yesterday to the highest in
more than a month. It climbed to $339 billion, the highest since
Nov. 7, according to ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker
of  U.S. government debt . It was $139 billion on Dec. 10, a two-
week low. Daily volume has averaged $240 billion in 2012.  The decision by the Fed yesterday to buy more securities
will follow the expiration at year-end of Operation Twist, a
$667 billion program in which the central bank has sold about
$45 billion in short-term Treasuries each month and bought an
equal amount of longer-term debt.  Twenty-nine percent of those  acquisitions  were of 20- to
30-year Treasuries. In its new program, 27 percent of the Fed’s
purchases will be in that area, policy makers announced
yesterday.  Twist Purchase  The Fed purchased $4.7 billion today in securities maturing
from February 2021 to November 2022 as part of Operation Twist.
It will sell as much as $8 billion of Treasuries due in 2015.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said yesterday interest
rates will stay low “at least as long as” the jobless rate
remains above 6.5 percent and if projected inflation “between
one and two years ahead” is no more than 2.5 percent.  “Inflation is one of the complications” from the Fed’s
extended purchase of securities,  Bill Gross , manager of the
world’s biggest bond fund at Pacific Investment Management Co.
said in a Bloomberg Television interview today on ’In the Loop’
with  Betty Liu . “It has inflationary potential. It hasn’t
happened yet. The Fed is comforted by that.”  Yield Curve  The extra yield investors demand to hold 30-year bonds
instead of two-year notes, the yield curve, increased to 265
basis points, the most since Oct. 18. The spread reached a 2012
high of 310 basis points on March 19 and a low for the year of
224 basis points on July 25.  Applications for jobless benefits in the U.S. fell by
29,000 to 343,000 in the week ended Dec. 8, the fewest since
reaching a four-year low in the period ended Oct. 6, Labor
Department data showed today. Economists in a Bloomberg survey
forecast 369,000. The number of people on unemployment benefit
rolls declined for a fourth straight week.  U.S. retail sales increased 0.3 percent in November, after
dropping 0.3 percent the previous month, Commerce Department
figures showed today in  Washington .  Wholesale prices in the U.S. fell more than forecast in
November, another report showed, signaling producer-price
inflation is in check.  The  producer price index  declined 0.8 percent, the most
since May, after falling 0.2 percent in October, the Labor
Department reported today in Washington. The median estimate in
a Bloomberg survey of 74 economists called for a 0.5 percent
decrease.  To contact the reporters on this story:
