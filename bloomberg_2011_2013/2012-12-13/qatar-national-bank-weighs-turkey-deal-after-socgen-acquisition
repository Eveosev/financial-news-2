Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) , the Middle
East’s biggest lender by assets, may seek to buy a stake in one
of the top 10 lenders in  Turkey  as it boosts expansion overseas,
Chief Financial Officer Ramzi Mari said.  “We’re not interested in a minority stake in Turkey,”
Mari said today on a conference call after QNB announced the
acquisition of a majority stake in Societe Generale’s Egyptian
NSGB unit. “Considering the competitiveness of the Turkish
market, we would have to go for one of the top 10 banks.”  Foreign banks are seeking to boost their presence in Turkey
with acquisitions and license applications.  OAO Sberbank (SBER) ,
Russia’s biggest lender, bought Turkey’s  Denizbank AS (DENIZ)  from
Belgium’s  Dexia SA (DEXB)  for 6.47 billion liras ($3.63 billion) in
June. Spain’s  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  paid $5.8
billion for a 24.9 percent stake in  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) ,
Turkey’s largest bank by market value, last year.  Fitch Ratings  cited a “sound banking system” when it
raised Turkey’s credit rating to investment grade BBB- on Nov.
5. Moody’s Investors Service boosted the foreign-currency
ratings of Turkey’s five biggest lenders by two levels to Baa2
in July, saying the banking industry was well-capitalized.  To contact the reporters on this story:
