A district court in Zagreb filed a
fifth corruption indictment against former Premier Ivo Sanader,
the news service  HINA  reported, citing prosecutor Tonci
Petkovic.  The charges are related to a government real estate deal in
2009, when Sanader was the head of the Cabinet. Petar
Cobankovic, former agriculture minister in the government led by
the Croatian Democratic Union, was also indicted in the case,
according to HINA.  Sanader, 59, is already serving a 10-year prison term for
bribery involving  Hungary ’s  Mol Nyrt. (MOL)  and Austria’s Hypo Alpe-
Adria-Bank International AG. He is appealing the verdict.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
