Apple Inc. (AAPL)  failed to persuade a
federal judge to rule that two  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  patents
are unenforceable because they allegedly were obtained through
manipulation.  U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, said
in an order today that she won’t consider Apple’s legal
arguments about the Samsung patents because a jury found that
the iPad-maker hadn’t infringed them. Samsung has said the
patents are essential to an industry standard for 3G mobile
technology. It sued Apple last year, accusing it of
infringement.  The jury found in Apple’s favor at trial. Still, Apple
sought a ruling from Koh that the patents were unenforceable,
alleging Samsung manipulated technology standard-setting
processes to obtain them, according to court filings.  “Because the court finds that these defenses cannot affect
the outcome of the present case in light of the jury’s finding
of noninfringement, the court, in its discretion, will not
consider these defenses at this time,” Koh said in her ruling.  Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-
based Apple, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment on the ruling.  Adam Yates , a spokesman for Samsung,
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the
decision.  The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 11-
cv-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
