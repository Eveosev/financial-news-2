Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the world’s largest
e-commerce company, has started selling E-books through its
China site, a week after the company announced it was doing the
same in  Brazil .  Users can download Kindle software for free from the China
 website  onto their iPhone, iPad or Android devices, which allows
them to read Kindle E-books on those devices, according to
information on the website. The site doesn’t indicate precisely
when sales of E-books began and doesn’t offer Kindle devices.  Amazon, which doesn’t supply country-specific financial
data, posted a 20 percent gain in international sales in the
third quarter, which included operations in Europe, China and
 Japan , the company said in October. China is “a great long-term
opportunity for us,” Thomas Szkutak, Amazon’s chief financial
officer, said in October.  Steve Frazier, Amazon’s vice president for  China  retail
operations, and Amazon’s Kindle public relations department
didn’t immediately respond to separate e-mailed requests today
for comment on the China Kindle store.  For Amazon, China is “a long-term opportunity, something
that we’ve been investing in for several years,” Szkutak said
on the Oct. 25 conference call. “You shouldn’t be expecting
high returns on invested capital in the short run, in that
geography, but very exciting from a long-term perspective.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
