Gold declined to a one-week low as a
rally to the highest level this month prompted some investors to
sell the metal amid concern about the U.S. budget deadlock.
Silver, platinum and palladium retreated.  Spot gold slumped as much as 1 percent to $1,694.35 an
ounce, the lowest price since Dec. 7, and traded at $1,700.90 at
10:49 a.m. in Singapore. The metal climbed to $1,723.40
yesterday, the most expensive since Nov. 30, after the  Federal
Reserve  said it will expand asset purchases. The rally was
“modest” as additional Fed balance sheet expansion was already
“priced in,” according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Gold dropped with other commodities including oil and
copper as the dollar rebounded from a three-day decline against
a basket of six major currencies. U.S. lawmakers said it’s
becoming less likely an agreement on the budget can be enacted
before the Christmas holiday, as House Speaker  John Boehner  said
yesterday both parties have “got some serious differences.”  “Investors are now focused on the fiscal cliff
negotiations, which are looking protracted and threatening to
weigh on all markets,” said Xiang Nan, an analyst at CITICS
Futures Co., a unit of  China ’s biggest listed brokerage. “ We
view a drop below $1,700 as a good buying opportunity. The Fed
sent a strong signal about supporting the economy and keeping
the easy monetary policy stance unchanged, which should support
higher  gold prices  in the longer term.”  Prices may be underpinned at $1,662 to $1,672.50, according
to technical analysis from Commerzbank AG, an area of support
made up of the November low, 200-day moving average and 50
percent retracement of the May-to-October rise, technical
analyst  Karen Jones  wrote in a report.  Fed Purchases  Gold is up 8.8 percent this year as central banks around
the world added to stimulus to spur growth. The Fed will buy $45
billion a month of  Treasury securities  starting in January and
will keep monetary policy accommodative as long as needed to
boost the economy. Still, Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
monetary stimulus cannot offset the full effect of the so-called
fiscal cliff of automatic tax increases and budget cuts set to
go into effect next year.  Gold for February delivery lost 0.9 percent to $1,701.80 an
ounce on the Comex in  New York . Holdings in exchange-traded
products yesterday fell for a second day to 2,626.049 metric
tons from a record on Dec. 10, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Cash silver dropped 1.5 percent to $32.9697 an ounce after
jumping 1.5 percent yesterday, the most since Nov. 23. Spot
platinum slid 0.8 percent to $1,622 an ounce, retreating for the
first time in six days. Palladium fell 0.7 percent to $685 an
ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
