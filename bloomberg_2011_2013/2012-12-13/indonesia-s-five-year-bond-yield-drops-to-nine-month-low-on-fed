Indonesia ’s bonds rose, pushing the
10-year yield to the least since February, after the Federal
Reserve expanded its asset-purchase program, boosting the
prospect of inflows into  emerging markets .  The rupiah advanced by the most in more than two weeks
after the Fed said yesterday it will start buying $45 billion of
Treasuries each month from January. Global funds added 3.35
trillion rupiah ($348 million) to their local-currency bond
holdings this month through Dec. 11, according to data from the
Finance Ministry. The yield on Indonesia’s 10-year notes was
5.27 percent today, the highest in Asia after  India .  “The Fed announcement increased investor appetite for
high-yielding assets like Indonesia’s,” said Raditya Ariwibowo,
a Jakarta-based research analyst in the treasury division at PT
Bank Negara Indonesia. “The rupiah will still be weighed down
by demand for dollars from importers, while being supported by
the central bank.”  The yield on the government’s 7 percent securities maturing
in May 2022 dropped five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point,
to 5.27 percent, the lowest level since Feb. 22, prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association show.  The rupiah strengthened 0.5 percent to 9,638 per dollar as
of 4:06 p.m. in Jakarta, the biggest gain since Nov. 26, prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. The currency
touched 9,733 on Dec. 10, the lowest level since September 2009.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, fell 61 basis points to
5.14 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
