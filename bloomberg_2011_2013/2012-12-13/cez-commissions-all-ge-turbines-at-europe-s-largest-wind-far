CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest Czech utility,
connected the final  General Electric Co. (GE)  turbine at Europe’s
largest wind farm to the grid, enabling the venture in eastern
Romania to generate enough power for 1 million homes a year.  CEZ, based in Prague, said today that all 240 of GE’s
turbines, each with a 2.5-megawatt capacity, are operating at
the Fantanele Cogealac wind complex. The facility in Constanta
county, with a capacity of 600 megawatts, is Europe’s biggest
land-based wind farm, according to CEZ.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
