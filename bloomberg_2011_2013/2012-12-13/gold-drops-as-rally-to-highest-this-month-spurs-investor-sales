Gold futures fell the most in a week
as mounting concerns on the  U.S. economy  and budget impasse
eroded investment demand for the precious metal. Silver had the
biggest drop in five weeks.  The  Federal Reserve  said yesterday that the economy will
expand 2.3 percent to 3 percent in 2013, compared with 2.5
percent to 3 percent estimated in September. Lawmakers expressed
pessimism on reaching a deal to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff
involving more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending
cuts at the start of the new year. Commodities headed for the
first annual decline since 2008.  “There’s disappointment in the Fed’s assessment of the
economy, and it seems to be saying that the economy will need
all the help it can get,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market
strategist at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in
a telephone interview. “There’s also a growing belief that
Congress can’t get a resolution to the fiscal cliff.”  Gold futures for delivery in February dropped 1.2 percent
to settle at $1,696.80 an ounce at 1:57 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, the biggest decline for a most-active contract since Dec.
4.  Yesterday,  holdings  in exchange-traded products backed by
gold fell for the second straight day.  Silver futures for March delivery slumped 4.2 percent to
$32.355 an ounce, the biggest slide since Nov. 2.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery dropped 2 percent to $1,612.80 an ounce, the
first loss in seven sessions.  Palladium futures for March delivery decreased 1.4 percent
to $691.65 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
