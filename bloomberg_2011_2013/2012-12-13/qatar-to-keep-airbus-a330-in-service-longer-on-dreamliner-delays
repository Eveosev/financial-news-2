Qatar Airways  Ltd. plans to keep its
Airbus SAS A330 aircraft in service longer than previously
planned because its new  Boeing Co. (BA)  787s aren’t arriving fast
enough, its chief executive officer said.  To avoid a capacity crunch on scheduled flights, Qatar is
moving protectively to upgrade some of the 29 A330s it has in
its fleet, CEO Akbar Al Baker said today. Changes include new
seats and in-flight entertainment, he added, without specifying
how many planes will be involved.  Al Baker said Qatar Airways has been falling behind its
expansion plan because of delays on the 787, which is comparable
in size to the A330 model. Qatar has already taken delivery of
three 787s and should get two more on Dec. 19, taking the fleet
to five. The figure will grow to 10 by the end of 2013, compared
with an original plan for 30 before the program delays.  “Due to these 787 delays we have a huge upgrade program
for our Airbus A330s to extend their time with us for at least
three more years,”  Al Baker  told journalists in  London .  A Boeing 787 jet just handed over to the airline developed
a technical glitch similar to one that forced a United
Continental Holdings Inc. aircraft to make an emergency landing,
Al Baker said today. The plane has been grounded since Dec. 9
and may remain so for at least four days, a situation Al Baker
called “unacceptable.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
