European Union finance ministers
have reached a “historic agreement” on joint banking
supervision, Financial Services Commissioner Michel Barnier said
today in a message on Twitter.  The deal will create a bank supervisor at the  European
Central Bank  to oversee financial institutions in the euro zone
and other EU nations that choose to participate. Negotiations
with the European Parliament are expected to begin next week,
according to Cyprus, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency.  The decision was unanimous, said  Jonathan Faull , an aide to
Barnier, also in a Twitter message.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
