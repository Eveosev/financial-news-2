The zloty declined for the second
day before Polish inflation figures for November are published
and as policy maker Jerzy Hausner predicted a third interest
rate cut in as many months in January.  The zloty weakened 0.1 percent to 4.0914 against the euro
at 10:07 a.m. in Warsaw, reducing this week appreciation’s to
0.7 percent, the biggest gain among 31 major currencies tracked
by Bloomberg. The yield on 10-year notes edged up 2 basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.89 percent.  Poland’s  inflation  rate is expected to fall to a two-year
low of 2.9 percent in the 12 months to November from 3.4 percent
in October, according to the median forecast from a Bloomberg
survey of 32 economists before the data are published at 2 p.m.
The central bank will probably cut rates next month as a
“deep” economic slowdown threatens to lower inflation below
the bank’s tolerance limit, Hausner said in an interview
yesterday.  “If inflation appears lower than market consensus, it may
spur a decline in shorter bond yields, as well as a slight
weakening of the zloty,” Jakub Borowski, Warsaw-based chief
economist at  Kredyt Bank SA (KRB) , wrote in e-mailed note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
