Walgreen Co. (WAG) , the largest U.S.
drugstore chain, was ordered to pay $16.6 million to resolve a
lawsuit brought by  California  cities alleging the retailer
tossed pesticides, paint and pharmaceutical waste into local
landfills.  Judge Wynne Carvill in Oakland ordered the payment in a
June lawsuit brought by  Los Angeles  and district attorneys in
six California counties who claimed that more than 600 Walgreen
stores unlawfully handled and disposed of hazardous materials
over a six-year period, Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O’Malley said today in an e-mail. The order couldn’t be
confirmed in electronic court records.  Inspections of Walgreen trash bins conducted last year
revealed that the company routinely sent waste to the landfills,
O’Malley said. The company also unlawfully disposed of customer
records containing confidential information, according to the e-
mail.  “Since 2007, we have invested millions of dollars to
develop and implement a comprehensive waste management program
at all of our California stores to properly handle and dispose
of discarded, damaged or expired consumer products that are
covered by hazardous waste regulations in California,” Jim
Graham, a Walgreen spokesman, said in an e-mail.  He said Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreen agreed to settle
without admitting wrongdoing to avoid the expense of litigation.  The case is California v. Walgreen, RG12635137, Alameda
County Superior Court (Oakland).  To contact the reporter on this story:
