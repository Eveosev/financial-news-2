  Najd Investments , a Dubai-based,
privately-owned company, and Siberian Agrarian Holding, a
Russian grain grower, are creating a joint venture to trade
 Russia ’s grain.  Siberian Agrarian, which has fields from Siberia to the
 Black Sea , will own 51 percent of the joint venture and Najd
Investments, whose founder and chairman is Prince Abulmohsin Bin
Abdullah Al Saud, 49 percent, according to a press conference in
Moscow today.  Under the agreement signed today, the joint venture will
exclusively sell Siberian Agrarian’s grain and Najd Investments
will only buy Russian-origin grain through the joint venture,
said Sergey Solousov, deputy chairman of the new venture and
head of corporate finance at Moscow-based investment company IFC
Metropol.  Siberian Agrarian operates about 400,000 hectares (988,400
acres) of lands. Its grain production was estimated at 340,000
metric tons last year, up from 322,000 tons before the 2010
drought.  To contact the reporter on this story:
