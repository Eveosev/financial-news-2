China ’s yuan strengthened the most
since March, halting a five-day drop, after the  Federal Reserve 
said yesterday it will step up asset purchases that boost the
supply of dollars and spur demand for emerging-market assets.  Industrial production and retail sales in Asia’s largest
economy rose last month at the fastest pace since March, while
export growth slowed, data showed in the past week. The Fed said
it will buy $45 billion of  Treasury securities  a month from
January to support the  U.S. economy , adding to existing monthly
purchases of $40 billion of mortgage debt.  The Fed’s decision “should be supportive of risk-on
sentiment,” said Suan Teck Kin, an economist at United Overseas
Bank Ltd. in  Singapore . “I am still looking for a bit of
strengthening for the  yuan  toward the end of the year. Overall,
the economic situation is on track for improvement, although the
trade numbers have been quite disappointing.”  The yuan advanced 0.3 percent to close at 6.2329 per dollar
in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. That is 0.9 percent stronger than the People’s Bank of
China’s reference rate, which was weakened by 0.01 percent today
to 6.2887. The yuan is allowed to fluctuate a maximum 1 percent
on either side of the fixing and tested the upper limit of its
trading band on most days since the end of October, reaching a
19-year high of 6.2223 on Nov. 27.  ‘Significantly Undervalued’  The Chinese currency climbed 1.2 percent against the dollar
this year following a 4.7 percent advance in 2011. It is
expected to strengthen 1.3 percent by the end of 2013, according
to the median estimate of 26 analysts in a Bloomberg News
survey.  The Treasury Department said on Nov. 27 that China isn’t a
currency manipulator under U.S. law, though the yuan “remains
significantly undervalued” and needs to rise further. The Asian
nation has built up $3.29 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves,
partly through intervention in  currency markets .  One-month implied volatility for the yuan, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options,
increased 21 basis points, or 0.21 percentage point, to 1.85
percent.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan rose 0.1 percent
to 6.2219 per dollar as of 5:07 p.m. local time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable
forwards gained 0.05 percent to 6.3105, a 1.2 percent discount
to the spot rate in Shanghai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
