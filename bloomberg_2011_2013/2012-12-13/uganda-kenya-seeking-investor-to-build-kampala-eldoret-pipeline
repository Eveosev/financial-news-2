Uganda  and  Kenya  are seeking bids to
build to a 352-kilometer (219-mile) oil-product pipeline after
canceling a concession to Libya’s Tamoil East Africa Ltd., Irene
Muloni, Uganda’s energy minister said.  Companies interested in building the reversible-flow
pipeline linking Kampala, Uganda’s capital, and the western
Kenyan city of Eldoret must submit their bids by Jan. 30,
according to an advertisement in the state-run New Vision
newspaper today.  “We canceled the Tamoil contract,” Muloni said by phone
from Kampala, the capital. “If you do not fulfill the terms of
an agreement, what do you expect?”  The pipeline for refined petroleum products will be
developed under a 20-year build-own-operate-transfer agreement,
according to the statement. The pipeline will connect with one
from Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, to Eldoret, according to the
statement.  Simon Kaheru, who works for public-relations company Media
Analyst and handles press inquiries for Tamoil in Uganda, didn’t
immediately have a comment when contacted by telephone.  Uganda opted for a reverse-flow pipeline in 2010 after the
2006 discovery of commercial  oil deposits , according to the
energy ministry.  London-based  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  and partners China National
Offshore Oil Corp. and France’s Total SA are jointly developing
the country’s oilfields, which they estimate as having 3.5
billion barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
