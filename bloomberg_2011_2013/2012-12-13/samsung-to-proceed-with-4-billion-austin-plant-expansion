Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the world’s
second-largest semiconductor maker, said it will go ahead with a
$4 billion expansion of its U.S. chip plants in Austin, Texas,
betting on surging demand for smartphone processors.  Samsung is boosting manufacturing capabilities for
application processors and will be in full production in the
second half of 2013, the Suwon, South Korea-based company said
in a statement today.  The expansion in so-called logic chips is part of Samsung’s
effort to win new customers and reduce its dependence on the
volatile memory-chip market. The company is affirming its plans
amid a legal fight with  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  -- its largest phone-
processor customer -- that has fueled speculation by analysts
such as Amit Daryanani at  RBC Capital Markets  that Apple may go
elsewhere for supply.  “Our ongoing, multibillion-dollar investments in Austin
will expand our footprint as a comprehensive semiconductor
hub,” Woosung Han, president of Samsung Austin Semiconductor,
said in a separate statement.  The company’s push into logic, including phone processors,
is an attempt to challenge contract chip manufacturers such as
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  Samsung’s Austin campus employs 2,500 workers and is its
biggest chip-production facility outside of  Korea . The site also
includes a 200-engineer research and design center, which is
expanding as well, Samsung said.  The company, the world’s largest maker of smartphones and
TVs, opened the site in 1996 and this expansion will bring its
total investment in Austin to $15 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
