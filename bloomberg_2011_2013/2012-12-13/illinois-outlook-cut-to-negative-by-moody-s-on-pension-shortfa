Illinois  had the outlook on about
$28 billion of general-obligation bonds revised to negative from
stable by Moody’s Investors Service, according to a statement
from the ratings company.  New York-based Moody’s, which already rates Illinois the
lowest among U.S. states, cited its underfunded pension systems
and said the shortfall is “likely to persist and perhaps
worsen.”  Illinois in January had its rating cut to A2, sixth-
highest, after a legislative session that “took no steps to
implement lasting solutions to its severe pension
underfunding.” The state’s worst-funded retirement system has
43.4 percent of assets needed to cover its obligations,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Illinois also has about
$8 billion in unpaid bills.  “Every day that goes by without action, the pension
problem gets worse,” Abdon Pallasch, Illinois’s assistant
budget director, said in a statement. “Skyrocketing pension
costs are eating up critical services like education and public
safety more and more every day.”  Democratic Governor  Pat Quinn  said this week that the
battle to control employee pension costs “is our fiscal cliff
and we need to deal with it” or ratings companies would lower
the state’s grade again.  To contact the reporter on this story:
