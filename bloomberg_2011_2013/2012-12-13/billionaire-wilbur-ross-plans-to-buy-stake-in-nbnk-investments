Billionaire investor Wilbur L. Ross
plans to buy a stake in  NBNK Investments Plc (NBNK)  after the firm
created by former Lloyds of London Chairman  Peter Levene  to bid
for financial firms failed to make a purchase in two years.  Ross’s funds will buy about 21.3 million shares in NBNK for
39 pence each, the company said in a statement today. NBNK will
make a tender offer to investors for a further 18.9 million
shares at the same price. Depending on the results of that
offer, Ross will own about 30 percent of the firm.  NBNK said in June it would disband after it failed to
acquire 632 branches from  Lloyds Banking Group Plc. (LLOY)  The company
was formed to acquire outlets being sold by British banks under
pressure from regulators to shrink their balance sheets after
receiving government bailouts.  “A significant majority of shareholders has indicated its
support for a continuation of the company and an ongoing effort
to make a significant acquisition,” NBNK said in a statement
today. “The new board intends, in consultation with
shareholders, to review its investment policy including
investment in continental  Europe .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
