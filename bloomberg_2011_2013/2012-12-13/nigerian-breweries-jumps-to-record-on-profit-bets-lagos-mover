     Dec. 13 (Bloomberg)--  Nigerian Breweries Plc (NB) , the country’s
biggest brewer by market value, gained for a sixth day and rose
to the highest on record on bets its profit will increase in
2013.  The stock gained 4.8 percent to 162 naira by the close in
Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital. The price is the highest
since Bloomberg began compiling data on the stock in 2002.  More
than 684,000 shares or 47 percent of the three-month moving
average traded.  Many investors expect better results in 2013 after interest
costs on loans used to finance the company’s recent expansion
reduced this year’s profit, Efemena Esalomi, an analyst at
Lagos-based Vetiva Capital Management Ltd., said today by phone.
“We have seen sales growth, what we are looking forward to next
year is growth in profit,” she said.  First-half revenue rose 24 percent to 136.5 billion naira
($865.6 million) from a year earlier, while net income increased
2 percent to 19.38 billion naira, the company  said July 25.  Nigerian Breweries, a unit of  Heineken NV (HEIA) , last year
acquired Sona Systems Associates Business Management Ltd. and
Life Breweries Co. to expand its capacity and add to its brands.
Its shares have risen 71.6 percent this year, compared with a
33.4 percent rise in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
