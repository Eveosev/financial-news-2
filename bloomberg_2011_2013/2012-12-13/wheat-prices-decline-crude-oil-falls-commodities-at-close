time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials declined
0.4 percent to 1,575.423.  CRUDE OIL  Oil slid from the highest level in a week as U.S. lawmakers
disagreed on measures to avert automatic spending cuts and tax
increases known as the fiscal cliff that threaten to curb
economic growth and fuel demand.  Crude for January delivery fell as much as 39 cents to
$86.38 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $86.52 at 4:07 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract advanced 98 cents to $86.77 yesterday, the highest
close since Dec. 5. Prices are down 12 percent this year, set
for the first annual decline since 2008.  OIL PRODUCTS

industrial metals as optimism about  Federal Reserve  plans to
expand economic stimulus faded and the dollar strengthened.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold declined to a one-week low as a rally to the highest
level this month prompted some investors to sell the metal amid
concern about the U.S. budget deadlock. Silver, platinum and
palladium retreated.  Spot gold slumped as much as 1 percent to $1,694.35 an
ounce, the lowest price since Dec. 7, and traded at $1,699.17 at
3:04 p.m. in Singapore. The metal climbed to $1,723.40
yesterday, the most expensive since Nov. 30, after the U.S.
Federal Reserve said it will expand asset purchases. The rally
was “modest” as additional Fed balance sheet expansion was
already “priced in,” according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Wheat declined to the lowest level in five months on
concern that  India , the world’s second-largest grower, may ship
more of the grain from government stockpiles, intensifying
competition among exporters.  The grain for March delivery lost as much as 0.6 percent to
$8.07 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest price
for the most-active contract since July 11. Futures traded at
$8.075 by 2:20 p.m. in Singapore, trimming this year’s advance
to 24 percent. The world’s most used food-grain is the best
performer this year among the 24 commodities tracked by the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  Corn for delivery in March slipped as much as 0.5 percent
to $7.22 a bushel before trading at $7.225, while soybeans for
March delivery declined 0.3 percent to $14.66 a bushel.  Rubber retreated from a 10-week high in a volatile trade
after a producer group gave no new measures  to boost prices and
as commodities fell amid concern about a U.S. budget deadlock.  The contract for delivery in May dropped 0.2 percent to
settle at 271.5 yen a kilogram ($3,247 a metric ton) on the
Tokyo Commodity Exchange. Futures earlier rose to 274.8 yen, the
