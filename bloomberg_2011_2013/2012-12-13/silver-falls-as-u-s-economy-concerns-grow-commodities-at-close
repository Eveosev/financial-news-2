 The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  fell 0.9 percent to 631.38 at 6:15
p.m. New York time, led by precious metals and energy.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  gauge  of 26 prices fell 0.8 percent
to 1,569.821.  PRECIOUS METALS  Silver had the biggest drop in five weeks and gold futures
fell the most in a week as mounting concerns on the U.S. economy
and budget impasse eroded demand for the precious metals.  Gold futures for delivery in February dropped 1.2 percent
to settle at $1,696.80 an ounce on the Comex in New York, the
biggest decline for a most-active contract since Dec. 4.  Silver futures for March delivery slumped 4.2 percent to
$32.355 an ounce, the biggest slide since Nov. 2.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
January delivery dropped 2 percent to $1,612.80 an ounce, the
first loss in seven sessions.  Palladium futures for March delivery decreased 1.4 percent

spending and U.S. retail sales increased less than expected in
November.  Crude for January delivery fell 88 cents, or 1 percent, to
settle at $85.89 a barrel on the Nymex. Prices are down 13
percent this year.  Brent for January settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange slid $1.59, or 1.5 percent, to end the
session at $107.91 a barrel.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures fell to the lowest price in almost 11
weeks after a government report showed that U.S. stockpiles
increased unexpectedly as mild weather cut demand for heating
fuels.  Natural gas for January delivery decreased 3.5 cents to
$3.347 per million British thermal units on the Nymex, the
lowest settlement price since Sept. 28. The futures have risen
12 percent this year, heading for the first annual gain since
2007.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline fell as U.S. supplies climbed to an eight-month
high last week and on concern that budget talks between the
White House and Congressional Republicans are stalled,
threatening the economic recovery.  Gasoline for January delivery fell 4.44 cents, or 1.7
percent, to settle at $2.6021 a gallon on the Nymex.  Heating oil for January delivery declined 2.31 cents, or
0.8 percent, to settle at $2.9437 a gallon a gallon on the
exchange.  The average nationwide cost for regular gasoline fell 1.4
cents to a $3.301 a gallon, AAA said today on its website.
That’s the lowest level since Jan. 3.  BASE METALS  Copper futures tumbled the most in five weeks on mounting
concern that U.S. lawmakers will fail to avoid $600 billion in
automatic tax increases and spending cuts, dimming the outlook
for economic growth and metals demand.  Copper futures for delivery in March retreated 1.5 percent
to settle at $3.66 a pound on the Comex in New York, the biggest
loss since Nov. 7. The decline pared the metal’s rally this year
to 6.5 percent.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months declined
0.7 percent to $8,074 a ton ($3.66 a pound).  Zinc, tin, aluminum and lead also fell in  London . Nickel

overseas buyers jumped to a two-year high. Corn and wheat
declined.  Soybean futures for March delivery rose 0.1 percent to
close at $14.725 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, after

$7.2025 a bushel in Chicago, the sixth straight decline.  Wheat futures for March delivery fell 0.4 percent to settle
at $8.085 a bushel, after touching $8.015, the lowest price for

supplies from Central America will add to ample offers from
