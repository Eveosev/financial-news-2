Crude in the  Gulf of Mexico  fell as
the spread between Brent and West Texas Intermediate narrowed.  Brentâ€™s  premium  to the U.S. benchmark fell 60 cents to
$22.13 a barrel at 1:30 p.m.  New York  time. Gulf oils are linked
to Brent because they compete with the global benchmark for
space in U.S. coastal refineries.  Light Louisiana Sweet fell 75 cents to a premium of $23 a
barrel to WTI on the  spot market  in the Cushing, Oklahoma, oil
hub at 2:01 p.m. New York time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The oil, which is the benchmark light, sweet crude on
the  Gulf Coast , gained against Brent the past three sessions.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet fell 55 cents to $21.95 a barrel more
than WTI. Other Gulf crudes, such as Mars Blend, Poseidon,
Southern Green and  Thunder Horse , also fell against the
benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
