Ossur Hf (OSSR) , the prosthetics maker
whose artificial feet are used by Olympic runner Oscar Pistorius, rose the most in two weeks in Copenhagen after Danske
Markets said the company may start returning cash to investors.  Ossur rose 2 percent to 7.55 kroner, the biggest gain since
Nov. 29, at 12:02 p.m. in the Danish capital. The volume traded
was 3.7 percent of the three-month daily average. The shares
hadn’t yet traded in Reykjavik where they also are listed.  Danske started coverage of the stock today with a buy
recommendation, saying Ossur may pay dividends as early as next
year. The Reykjavik-based medical technology company said Oct.
23 that free cash flow for the first nine months of the year
jumped 39 percent, to $28.5 million, as new production
facilities in  Mexico  helped boost profitability.  “Our positive stance is backed by both relative and
absolute valuations, and we see the stock as a strong defensive
cash generator,” Copenhagen-based Danske said in a note to
clients. The bank set a price estimate of 9 kroner a share.  Pistorius, a South African sprinter, participated in the
2012 London Olympics using Ossur’s J-shaped carbon-fiber blades.
Known as the “Blade Runner,” Pistorius was born without
fibulas and had both legs amputated below the knee when he was
11 months old.  To contact the reporter on this story:
