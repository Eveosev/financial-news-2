U.K. Energy Secretary  Ed Davey   will
rescind a ban on shale-gas exploration, opening the door for
Cuadrilla Resources Ltd. to resume its activities, according to
a person familiar with the decision.  Davey is expected to announce the move today, said the
person, who isn’t authorized to speak to the press and asked not
to be named.  Hydraulic fracturing, using pressurized water to drive gas
from shale rock, was suspended after Cuadrilla set off two
earthquakes last year in northwest England.  Britain is promoting gas with tax breaks for shale
exploration as it seeks to ensure energy supplies and investment
in replacing power stations that are due to be retired. Prime
Minister  David Cameron  said Dec. 11 that the U.K. should be at
the heart of a “shale gas revolution.” The government also is
attempting to hold down utility bills and reduce emissions from
fossil fuels such as oil and coal.  Cuadrilla Resources, which is seeking approval to fracture
and test a number of sites next year, said the shale rock it’s
exploring in northwest  England  has more gas than all of  Iraq .  To contact the reporters on this story:
