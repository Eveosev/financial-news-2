Latvia’s three biggest banks may
fall under European Central Bank supervision when new banking
rules take effect, Latvian Finance Minister Andris Vilks said on
his Twitter  account , without giving additional details.  European Union finance ministers agreed yesterday to put
the ECB in charge of all euro-area lenders in a deal that paves
the way for the currency bloc’s firewall fund to provide direct
bailouts to banks.  Latvia hopes to join the currency bloc in 2014, the year
the new supervisory mechanism should be fully ready.  To contact the reporter on this story:
