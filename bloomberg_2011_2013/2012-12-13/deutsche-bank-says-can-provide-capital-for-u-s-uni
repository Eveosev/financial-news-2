Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Germany ’s largest
bank, will be able to provide the necessary capital for its U.S.
business should local regulators implement stricter rules, Chief
Financial Officer Stefan Krause said.  A key issue “for us will be which one of our entities that
are today non-regulated might become regulated, and then we have
to look into the capital position,” Krause said on a conference
call with analysts and investors today. “We are confident to
then be able to capitalize this position.”  Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo said last month
that the central bank is planning tougher capital and leverage
rules for U.S. units of foreign banks. Krause said that while
Deutsche Bank looks “with quite some concern” to the U.S. and
potential regulation in the country, the firm can’t yet tell
what the consequences for its business will be.  The Fed will force non-U.S. firms to house all of their
U.S. businesses, including securities trading, within regulated
holding companies, Tarullo said Nov. 28. Those holding companies
also must abide by capital and liquidity rules that already
apply to U.S. counterparts, he said. That means foreign banks’
local units would have to bolster capital in the U.S. to guard
against losses, regardless of their parents’ resources.  “We are very aware that there might be additional
regulations coming,” Krause said. “Bear with us. We need to
know these regulations in detail before we can make any
substance and material statements around implications for the
bank.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
