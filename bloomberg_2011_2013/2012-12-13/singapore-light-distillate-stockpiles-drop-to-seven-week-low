Light-distillate inventories in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center, fell
9.6 percent to the lowest in seven weeks, according to a unit of
the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including naphtha, gasoline and
reformate slid 967,000 barrels to 9.11 million barrels in the
seven days to yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said
today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the lowest level since
the week ended Oct. 24.  Stockpiles of  middle distillates  including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene dropped 1.62 million barrels, or 14
percent, to 9.86 million barrels, the ministry’s data showed.
That’s the biggest decline in three weeks.  Residual-fuel inventories including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur
waxy residue and excluding bitumen decreased 2.45 million
barrels, or 11 percent, to 20.5 million, according to the data.
Supplies were down for the first time in six weeks.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
