Brisa-Auto Estradas de Portugal SA 
fell the most in more than four months after the country’s
securities regulator said the road operator’s biggest investor
won’t have to buy all stock before ending the company’s listing.  Brisa dropped as much as 11 percent to 1.97 euros a share,
the biggest intraday decline since Aug. 10, and was trading down
9 percent at 11:54 a.m. in Lisbon, valuing the toll-road
management company at 1.21 billion euros ($1.58 billion).  “Some investors are selling Brisa shares because they
don’t want to risk not getting paid before the company exits the
stock market,” said  Pedro Oliveira , a trader at Go Bulling in
Lisbon.  Tagus Holdings Sarl, a venture of Portuguese holding
company Jose de Mello SGPS SA and Arcus Infrastructure Partners,
asked the regulator, or CMVM, on Sept. 4 for permission to
remove Brisa from trading in Lisbon after securing 92 percent of
the highway operator’s voting rights.  The CMVM said late yesterday in a  supplementary statement 
to its decision that Tagus should give minority shareholders a
chance to sell their stakes before Brisa’s de-listing, though it
may not have to buy shares from investors who acquired stock
after the results of its takeover bid were announced Aug. 9.
Tagus has 15 working days from the Dec. 5 ruling date to
respond, the regulator said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
