Ghana ’s cedi gained for a second
day, heading for the strongest level in three weeks.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
appreciated by 0.2 percent to 1.8908 per dollar as of 1:27 p.m.
in Accra, the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
A close at this level will be the highest since Nov. 22,
according to the data.  “The market got some inflows from offshore bond buyers on
the secondary market,” Chris Nettey, a currency trader at the
local unit of Standard Bank Group Ltd., said by phone today.  Yields on Ghana’s bonds in cedi issued on Oct. 8 and due in
2015 fell 50 basis points to 22.25 percent as 1:30 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
