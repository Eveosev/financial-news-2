Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
made a surprise appearance at a meeting of the European People’s
Party in Brussels also attended by his predecessor Silvio Berlusconi and German Chancellor  Angela Merkel .  It marked the first time that Monti attended an EPP meeting
before a European Union summit since he was appointed to head an
unelected government of non-politicians 13 months ago. Monti’s
appearance at the gathering comes amid mounting pressure on the
premier to seek a second term in elections that will probably be
held in February.  The two Italian leaders coincided a day after Berlusconi
said he would abandon plans to run for a sixth time if Monti
would enter the race and lead a coalition of “moderate
parties.” Berlusconi was also meeting Merkel for the first time
after blaming “German-centric” policies for Italy and Europe’s
economic woes in a Dec. 5 interview with Canale 5 television.  European Commission President  Jose Manuel Barroso  and
Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  are among the other
European leaders attending the EPP meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
