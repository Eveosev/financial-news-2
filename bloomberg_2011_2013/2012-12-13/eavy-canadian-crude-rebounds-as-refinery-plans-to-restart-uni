Canadian heavy oil on the  spot
market  strengthened from an all-time low discount to the U.S.
benchmark price as  BP Plc (BP/)  was said to expect to restart a crude
unit tomorrow at its refinery in Whiting, Indiana.  BP shut Pipestill 11C on Dec. 7 for unplanned repairs, a
person familiar with operations said today. An attempted restart
of the unit, which processes sour crude, was unsuccessful, said
the person, who declined to be identified because the
information isnâ€™t public.  West Canada Select, a sour crude blended from conventional,
heavy Canadian oils, strengthened $1 to a $37 discount to West
Texas Intermediate in Cushing, Oklahoma, at 2:01 p.m.  New York 
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Canadian oil fell $8.50 from Dec. 7, when the crude
unit shut down, until yesterday, when it hit a $38-a-barrel
discount against the U.S. benchmark crude. That was the largest
discount since Bloomberg began tracking Canadian crude prices in
May 2008.  Syncrude, a synthetic light, sweet oil upgraded from tar-
like bitumen from  Canada , was unchanged at 85 cents a barrel
above WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
