Magyar Export-Import Bank Zrt., the
Hungarian state-owned lender that sold $500 million in bonds
this month, plans to extend 70 percent of its loans to exporting
companies through commercial banks, Magyar Nemzet reported,
citing Eximbank Chief Executive Officer Roland Natran.  Euro-denominated loans, ranging in maturity from two years
to 10 years, may carry an  interest rate  below 5 percent, Natran
said, according to the newspaper. The company plans to sell 2
billion euros in bonds in the next two years to boost its loans
to exporters, Nemzet said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
