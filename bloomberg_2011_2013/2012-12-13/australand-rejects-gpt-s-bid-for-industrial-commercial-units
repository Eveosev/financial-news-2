Australand Property Group (ALZ)  rejected a
bid from  GPT Group (GPT)  for its industrial and commercial property
assets and development business, saying the offer “does not
provide a compelling value proposition.”  Australand’s board won’t engage with GPT, whose proposal
doesn’t pay a sufficient premium or compensate shareholders for
the transaction costs and risks involved with the deal, Sydney-
based Australand said in a statement to the Australian stock
exchange today. GPT,  Australia ’s second-biggest diversified real
estate trust, responded in a separate statement that the offer
provides a compelling value.  Australand  shares  jumped 3.4 percent to A$3.31, the highest
since July 2008, at the close of trading in Sydney, bringing
 this year’s gains  to 38 percent. GPT  shares  fell 1.1 percent to
A$3.56, paring this year’s increase to 16 percent.  GPT’s offer involved Australand, controlled by Singapore’s
 Capitaland Ltd. (CAPL) , keeping its residential business and remaining
a listed entity. Australand’s industrial and office investment
properties were valued at A$2.3 billion ($2.4 billion) at June
30. GPT offered a premium of A$140 million to the assets,
Australand said in today’s statement.  GPT’s offer represents a premium of 24.3 Australian cents a
share, 7 percent higher than Australand’s A$3.46 a share net
tangible asset backing, GPT said.  “GPT is committed to advancing a proposal, which it
believes is in the best interests of Australand’s and GPT’s
securityholders,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
