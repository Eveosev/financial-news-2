Georgia-Pacific LLC, the tissue-
maker owned by Koch Industries Inc., said it agreed to buy a
unit of  International Paper Co. (IP)  for $750 million to gain 16 U.S.
factories that make construction materials.  The purchase of the Temple-Inland Building Products unit
includes facilities that make gypsum, lumber, fiberboard and
particle board, Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific said today in a
statement. The transaction should close in the first quarter,
pending regulatory approvals, it said.  International Paper, which acquired Temple-Inland Inc. in
February for $4.3 billion, is selling the building-products unit
because it isn’t “core” to its strategy, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer John Faraci said in a separate statement.
Georgia-Pacific said the building-products assets are located
near large and growing regions.  “This will allow us to expand our geographic footprint and
enhance our service to new and existing customers,” Georgia-
Pacific CEO Jim Hannan said in his company’s statement.  International Paper, based in  Memphis , Tennessee, said
proceeds will be used to pay down debt. The company, the world’s
largest pulp and paper producer, sold three U.S. containerboard
mills in July to fulfill a  Department of Justice  settlement
related to the Temple-Inland purchase.  International Paper rose 1.1 percent to $37.79 as of 10:47
a.m. in New York.  The shares  have gained 28 percent this year.  Koch Industries , based in Wichita,  Kansas , has owned
Georgia-Pacific since 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
