The  International Monetary Fund  has
received reassurance from euro-area finance officials that they
won’t let  Greece ’s debt exceed a 2020 target of 124 percent of
the country’s gross domestic product, a fund spokesman said.  “They’ve made the commitment to 124 percent by 2020 and
basically indicated that they will take the steps necessary to
ensure that that objective is met,” IMF spokesman Gerry Rice
told reporters in  Washington  today. “In terms of a reassurance,
I think that statement is fairly clear.”  European officials today approved the payout of 49.1
billion euros ($64 billion) of loans through March after
receiving the results of a Greek bond buyback program. All told,
the program will trim Greece’s debt to 128 percent of gross
domestic product by 2020, still above 124 percent, according to
documents released by the German Finance Ministry yesterday.  Separately, Rice said IMF Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  would report to the board about Argentina’s statistics
on Dec. 17. A board meeting to make a decision regarding the
country has not been said yet, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
