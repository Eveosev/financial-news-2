The  European Central Bank  said the
euro area’s economic slump will extend into next year and
inflation will drop below its 2 percent limit.  “Later in 2013 economic activity should gradually recover,
as global demand strengthens and our accommodative monetary
policy stance and significantly improved financial market
confidence work their way through to the economy,” the
Frankfurt-based ECB said in its monthly bulletin today, echoing
President  Mario Draghi ’s Dec. 6 policy statement. Still, “the
Governing Council continues to see downside risks to the
economic outlook for the euro area,” it said.  The ECB last week forecast that the 17-nation euro-area
economy will shrink 0.5 percent this year and 0.3 percent in
2013. It left the  benchmark interest rate  unchanged at a record
low of 0.75 percent.  Inflation is “expected to fall below 2 percent in 2013,”
the ECB reiterated in today’s bulletin. “Over the policy-
relevant horizon, inflation rates should remain in line with
 price stability .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
