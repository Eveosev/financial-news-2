German electricity for delivery in
2013 fell for a third day to a record as European Union
emissions permits declined.  German power for 2013 lost as much as 0.6 percent to a
record-low 45.30 euros ($59.24) a megawatt-hour and traded at
45.45 euros as of 5:15 p.m. in Berlin, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg.  EU carbon permits for December traded down 1.8 percent to
6.63 euros a metric ton after declining as much as 3.1 percent
to 6.54 euros on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .
Power can track emissions prices, which affect production costs
at plants which burn fossil fuels, such as natural gas and coal.  The German  2013 clean-dark spread , a measure of the profit
utilities get from selling electricity after accounting for the
cost of coal and emissions permits, was 2.1 percent lower at
10.05 euros a megawatt-hour, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The 2013  clean-spark spread , for gas-fed generators,
narrowed 0.9 percent to minus 12.65 euros a megawatt-hour.  The low temperature in  Frankfurt  may rise to 3 degrees
Celsius (18 Fahrenheit) on Dec. 16, compared with todayâ€™s minus
6 degrees, and a 10-year average of zero degrees, according to
CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
