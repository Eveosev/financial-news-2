The pound fell for the first time in
four days against the dollar as a report showed the majority of
U.K. manufacturers are seeing orders decline.  Sterling weakened against 12 of its 16 major peers amid
bets the central bank will resume asset-purchases under its
program of so-called quantitative easing. A gauge of
manufacturing orders rose to minus 12 from minus 21 in November,
the  Confederation of British Industry  said.   The pound depreciated 0.2 percent to $1.6122 at 11:39 a.m.
London time after rising to $1.6172 yesterday, the strongest
level since Nov. 1. The currency was little changed at 81 pence
per euro, after depreciating for two days.  The 10-year gilt yield fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.82 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
