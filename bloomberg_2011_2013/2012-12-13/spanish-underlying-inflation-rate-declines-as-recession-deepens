Spain’s core  inflation  rate dropped
in November from a four-high year as the euro region’s fourth-
largest economy was on track to shrink for a sixth straight
quarter, easing pressure on prices.  Annual core  inflation , which excludes energy and fresh food
prices, fell to 2.3 percent from 2.5 percent a month earlier,
the National Statistics Institute in Madrid said today. That
compares with a 2.2 percent median forecast of four estimates in
a Bloomberg survey. Underlying prices rose 0.2 percent from
October.  Spain is facing a deepening  recession  as Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  struggles to tackle a  budget deficit  that matches
that of Greece as the euro-area’s second biggest after Ireland.
The  European Central Bank  last week cut its 2013 inflation
forecast for the region and left the door open for a benchmark
 interest rate  cut as it sees the economy shrinking next year.  Spain’s headline inflation rate, based on EU calculations,
was 3 percent, matching an estimate published on Nov. 30.
Excluding the impact of tax increases, the annual inflation rate
was 0.9 percent, based on Spanish calculations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
