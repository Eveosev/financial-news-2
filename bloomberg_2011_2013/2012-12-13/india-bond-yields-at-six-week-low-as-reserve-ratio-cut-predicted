India ’s 10-year bonds gained,
pushing the yield to a six-week low, as economists predict the
central bank will cut cash-reserve  requirements  for lenders next
week to the least since 1976.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will lower the proportion of
funds that must be set aside by 25 basis points, or 0.25
percentage point, to 4 percent on Dec. 18, according to 11 of 15
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. One forecasts a 50 basis
point reduction, while the rest expect no change.  “The RBI may cut the CRR to support recent efforts to
boost growth,” said Upasna Bhardwaj, an economist at ING Vysya
Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “The central bank is likely to be
proactive in liquidity management.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes maturing in June 2022
fell one basis point to 8.167 percent as of 10:30 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. That’s the
lowest level since Oct. 29.  Asia ’s third-largest economy  grew  5.3 percent in the July
to September quarter, according to government data, matching the
slowest pace since 2009. The monetary authority last cut the
reserve requirement by 25 basis points on Oct. 30, taking the
total reduction to 175 basis points this year.  The central bank resumed bond purchases this month, after a
five-month hiatus, to boost cash supplies and revive the economy.
The RBI has bought 1.1 trillion rupees ($20.3 billion) of
government debt so far this fiscal year that started April 1.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell two basis
points to 7.66 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
