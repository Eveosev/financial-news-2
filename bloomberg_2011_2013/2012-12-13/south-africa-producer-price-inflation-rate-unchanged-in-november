South Africa ’s producer-price
 inflation  rate was unchanged in November, giving the  Reserve
Bank  room to keep  interest rates  low to stimulate growth.  The cost of goods leaving factories and mines rose 5.2
percent in November from a year ago, Pretoria-based Statistics
South Africa said on its website today. The  median estimate  of
12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 5.5 percent. Prices
increased 0.3 percent in the month.  “The down-side surprise would feed into relief” for
consumer prices, Carmen Nel, a Cape Town-based analyst at Rand
Merchant Bank, said by phone. “Input cost pressures,
significantly from the rand, seem to be largely absent.”  The Reserve Bank has held the benchmark repurchase rate at
5 percent since July. Consumer-price inflation was unchanged at
5.6 percent last month, the statistics agency said yesterday.
The bank’s goal is to keep inflation within a range of 3 percent
to 6 percent.  While the bank has room to adjust rates if necessary, it
wouldn’t be appropriate now, Governor Gill Marcus said on Nov.
28. Policy makers will make their next rate decision on Jan. 24.  Inflation near the top of the central bank’s target has
curbed its ability to stimulate the economy, which is set to
expand 2.5 percent this year, the slowest pace since a 2009
recession.  The rand was little changed at 8.6512 per dollar at 11:51
a.m. in Johannesburg, taking its decline this year to 6.5
percent. The yield on the rand debt due in 2021 dropped 1 basis
point to 6.458 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
