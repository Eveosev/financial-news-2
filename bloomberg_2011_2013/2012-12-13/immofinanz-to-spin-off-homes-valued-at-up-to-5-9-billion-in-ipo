Immofinanz AG (IIA)  plans to spin off
homes valued at as much as 4.5 billion euros ($5.9 billion) in
an initial public offering, Eduard Zehetner, chief executive
officer of the Austrian real estate company, said in an
interview.   Immofinanz will buy more German apartments before the IPO.
The Vienna-based company said in September it may sell Buwog, an
Austrian unit, and some German properties in a 2014 offering,
without giving a value for the assets. Immofinanz owns about 2.4
billion euros of homes in  Austria  and 127 million euros of
German assets.  “Our plan is to grow our German residential segment to a
similar size as the Austrian segment, combine the two elements
and then take the whole unit to the market,” Zehetner said by
phone.  Other residential landlords also plan to sell shares to the
public to take advantage of demand from investors seeking a safe
place for their money amid the European sovereign debt crisis.
Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd., which owns German landlord
Deutsche Annington AG, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which holds
LEG NRW GmbH, are planning to take their German residential
units public in 2013.  In September, Zehetner said the spinoff of Buwog, its
residential-property arm, would sharpen Immofinanz’s focus on
commercial properties. Immofinanz has about 10.4 billion euros
of real estate and development projects in eastern  Europe ,
Austria and  Germany . Most of its assets are offices, stores and
warehouses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
