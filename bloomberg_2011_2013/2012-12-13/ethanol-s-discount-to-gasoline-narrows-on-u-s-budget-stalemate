Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed on concern that U.S. budget talks are stalled.  A decline for the biofuel was outpaced by a drop in
gasoline after House Speaker  John Boehner  said the White House
isn’t serious about cutting spending. His comment came a day
after the Energy Department said gasoline inventories rose as
refiners operated at the highest seasonal rates since 2004.
Ethanol  supplies  jumped to the highest level since June.  “Even taking into account the decrease in production, the
DOE inventory numbers definitely indicate an overabundance of
ethanol supplies at the moment,” said Mike Breitenbach, an
analyst and trader at Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC in  New York .  Ethanol’s discount to gasoline narrowed to 31.21 cents a
gallon from 32.65 cents yesterday, based on futures settlement
prices. The differential has averaged 61.57 cents this year.  Denatured ethanol for January delivery fell 3 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.29 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the
lowest price since Sept. 27. Prices dropped for a sixth day, the
longest streak of losses since July 26. The futures have climbed
4 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast slid 5.5
cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.415 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive declined 2.5 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.36, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in Chicago decreased 4 cents, or 1.7 percent, to
$2.29 a gallon and in New York the biofuel lost 2.5 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.395.  Gasoline Drops  Gasoline for January delivery slumped 4.44 cents, or 1.7
percent, to settle at $2.6021 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline,
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  Corn for March delivery fell 5.25 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$7.2025 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 31 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, up from 30
cents yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed from
the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol
production that can be fed to livestock, according to data
collected by Bloomberg.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
RINs, tumbled 15 percent to 4.76 cents, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. RINs are credits that help the government track
whether refiners are meeting 2012 federal ethanol use mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
