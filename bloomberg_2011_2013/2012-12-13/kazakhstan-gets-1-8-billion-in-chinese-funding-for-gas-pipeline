Kazakhstan  won $1.8 billion in
Chinese funding to build a natural-gas pipeline from its oil-
rich west to the densely-populated south, and may ship supplies
to its East Asian neighbor.  China  Development Bank Corp. agreed to provide funds in a
deal signed Dec. 11 in  Hong Kong , Kazakhstan’s state gas shipper
KazTransGaz said today in an e-mailed statement.  The 1,475-kilometer (917-mile) pipe from Beineu to Shymkent
will be built by China National Petroleum Corp. and state energy
producer KazMunaiGaz National Co. The two companies agreed on
plans for its construction in 2008 as China sought gas to feed
its burgeoning economy. They’ve invested $500 million each in a
joint venture to build the link, KazTransGaz’s  website  shows.  The line will ship as much as 10 billion cubic meters a
year, Kazakhstan’s Oil and Gas Ministry said in September. The
link may export gas to China once domestic demand is met, the
ministry said.  KazTransGaz, based in Astana, is a unit of KazMunaiGaz.  -- Editors: Amanda Jordan,  Tony Barrett   To contact the reporter on this story:
