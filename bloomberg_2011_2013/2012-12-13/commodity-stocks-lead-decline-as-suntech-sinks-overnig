Chinese commodity producers fell in
New York, driving the first drop in the  benchmark index  in seven
days, as raw material prices declined. Solar stocks slipped on
concern state subsidies won’t bolster the industry.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. retreated 0.8 percent to 94.53
yesterday, after rallying 3.7 percent over the previous six
days. Electricity producer  Huaneng Power International Inc. (HNP) 
slipped to trade at the biggest discount to its Hong Kong shares
in two weeks, while  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (YZC)  dropped a second
day.  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP)  was the biggest solar decliner
as Macquarie Group Ltd. said the sector’s outlook remains
bearish even as  China  allocates more subsidies.  Oil and Metals prices dropped as a less-than-estimated
increase in U.S. retail sales in November clouded the outlook
for China’s second-largest export market. The Asian nation,
where economic growth has slowed over the past seven quarters,
won’t undertake large-scale stimulus next year, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday, citing unidentified
analysts. Solar companies have  led declines  in the China-US
gauge this year as depressed global prices and overcapacity
limit growth.  “People expect some change to further improve the
economy,”  Timothy Ghriskey , chief investment officer at New
York-based Solaris Group LLC, which manages about $2 billion,
including Chinese stocks, said by phone yesterday. “There’s
just some profit-taking here after the gains Chinese equities
had. The overhang on the policy direction is still there.”  ETF Sinks  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., slumped 0.9 percent to $38.66,
retreating from a nine-month high. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index fell 0.6 percent to 1,419.45 as House of Representatives
Speaker  John Boehner  said U.S. President  Barack Obama  is “not
serious” about spending cuts.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  slipped 0.2 percent
yesterday to 11,142.92, while the  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of
domestic shares lost 1 percent to 2,061.48.  American depositary receipts of Huaneng, China’s largest
electricity producer, dropped 2.1 percent to $35.4, the lowest
level since Dec. 4. The Beijing-based company’s ADRs traded 0.6
percent below its Hong Kong-traded stock, the biggest  discount 
since Nov. 27. Each ADR is equal to 40 ordinary shares.  Yanzhou Coal, the fourth-largest coal miner in China,
declined 1.6 percent to $15.8, the steepest slump since Dec. 3.
 Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , the nation’s biggest maker of the
lightweight metal, sank 1.6 percent to $11.13 in New York, the
largest loss in three weeks.  Coal Prices  China’s Bohai-Rim Steam-Coal Price Index, which tracks
power-station coal prices at six Chinese ports, fell 0.3 percent
as of Dec. 12 from a week earlier, according to the Qinhuangdao
Seaborne Coal Market website. Three-month aluminum contracts
lost 0.7 percent on the London Metal Exchange to $2,126 a metric
ton. The S&P GSCI Index of commodities slipped 0.9 percent
yesterday after rising in the previous two days.  ADRs of PetroChina Co., the country’s biggest oil producer,
declined 0.6 percent to $137.95. The company agreed to form a
joint venture with Encana Corp.,  Canada ’s largest natural gas
producer, according to a statement yesterday.  Crude for January delivery fell 1 percent to $85.89 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday. Prices are
down 13 percent this year.  Suntech Slumps  Suntech, the world’s largest solar-panel maker, based in
Jiangsu, China, lost 3.5 percent to 96 cents after jumping 11
percent a day earlier to a five-week high. LDK Solar, the
world’s second-largest maker of solar wafers, which is based in
Xinyu, China, declined 2.5 percent to $1.17, after surging 15
percent Dec. 12.  China’s solar demand will be less than 20 percent of global
demand in 2013 while there is about 100 percent overcapacity
along the industry’s supply chain, according to a report
yesterday by Sydney-based Macquarie.  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. and Trina Solar Co.
extended gains in the previous day. Both companies were chosen
to receive subsidies in the government’s second round for
developers of more than 100 new energy projects, according to a
statement on the website of China’s Science and Technology
Ministry Dec. 12. Yingli added 2.3 percent to $2.19 yesterday,
the highest level since July while Trina climbed 4.8 percent to
a one-month high of $3.94.  ‘Indicates Concerns’  “The Chinese government’s subsidy could win the Chinese
companies some shares, but you also get into the question of
whether subsidies are fair globally and it could cause trade
sanctions,” Solaris Group’s Ghriskey said. “The volatility in
solar stocks usually indicates concerns.”  Ten-day volatility  in LDK Solar shares rose to 133
yesterday, the highest level since Nov. 20 and compared with a
13 reading for the China-US index. Price swings for Suntech
climbed to 69 from as low as 20 on Nov. 30, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Phoenix New Media Ltd. (FENG) , a Beijing-based Internet, TV and
mobile-news provider, rallied 5.3 percent yesterday to $3.38,
leading companies that rose on the Bloomberg China-US gauge.  21Vianet Group Inc. (VNET) , an Internet data-center service
provider, sank 4.9 percent to $8.73, the biggest decline in a
month. Matrix Partners China I LP, a venture-capital fund, sold
227,000 ADRs of 21Vianet on Dec. 6 for a total $2 million, a
regulatory filing yesterday showed.  Twelve-month non-delivery forwards on the  yuan  weakened
0.04 percent to 6.3151 per dollar in New York, after the
currency gained 0.3 percent, the most since March 22, to 6.2329
yesterday in  Shanghai .  To contact the reporter on this story:
