Vinci SA (DG) , the largest builder in
 Europe , has been awarded contracts by Jamaicaâ€™s water commission
to stem leakage problems in the Kingston area and lay pipes for
a water-treatment station on the Rio Cobre river.  The water network improvements for contracts valued at 60
million euros ($78 million) also include rehabilitating three
drinking water-treatment plants on the north coast of the island
and laying water pipes in Port Antonio, Vinci said today in a
statement. The works will take 18 to 24 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
