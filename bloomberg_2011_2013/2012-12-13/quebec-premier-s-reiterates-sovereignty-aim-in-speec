Pauline Marois, premier of Canada’s
second-most populous province, reiterated her aim to move  Quebec 
toward independence and said it values its relationship with the
U.S.  “I hope that the people of Quebec will one day be a part
of the concert of nations,” Marois said today in a speech to
the Foreign Policy Association of New York. “This is an
internal debate. This will happen when Quebecers are ready.”  Marois, who led the separatist Parti Quebecois to a
minority mandate in the Sept. 4 provincial election, is in New
York as part of a two-day trip in a bid to boost trade ties
between the province and the U.S. Quebec ships about 70 percent
of its international exports to the U.S.  The goal of sovereignty “won’t change our geography and
the strength of our relationship with our American friends and
partners,” she said. “We place the highest value on our
relationship with the United States.”  Marois also said Quebec welcomes trade and investment.
Gross debt as a percentage of gross domestic product will
decline to 45 percent by 2026, Marois said, repeating an earlier
pledge, and said “the most obvious solution is simply to borrow
less by better targeting our expenditures in infrastructure
investments and tightening up their management.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
