Palm oil slumped to a three-year low
on speculation that shipments from  Malaysia , the world’s second-
largest producer, may decline for a second month.  The contract for February delivery fell 0.5 percent to
2,230 ringgit ($730) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the lowest price at close for the most-active contract
since November 2009. Futures are set for a 30 percent drop this
year, the worst annual loss since the financial crisis in 2008.  Tariff on crude palm oil exports from Malaysia may be zero
next month under a new tax structure, Maybank Investment Bank
Bhd. said Dec. 11. The average free-on-board price between Nov.
10 and Dec. 9 that will be taken to set the January levy is
estimated to be below the minimum threshold of 2,250 ringgit for
the tax to apply, analysts Ong Chee Ting and Chai Li Shin said.  “If the tax next month is going to be zero, some people
may take the opportunity to export next month,” said Ivy Ng, an
analyst at CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. “Most people will just buy
hand-to-mouth. I would expect exports to be better in January.”  Exports from Malaysia fell 2.8 percent to 504,032 tons in
the first 10 days of December from 518,688 tons in the same
period a month earlier, surveyor Intertek said Dec. 10.
Stockpiles climbed 2.3 percent to an all-time high of 2.56
million tons in November from a month earlier, the Malaysian
Palm Oil Board said Dec. 10.  “The stocks are still high and they have to keep prices
low to get rid of the stocks,” said Ng.  Soybean oil for delivery in January was little changed at
49.51 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
March lost 0.2 percent to $14.6825 a bushel.  Palm oil for May delivery gained 0.3 percent to close at
6,698  yuan  ($1,070) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange.
Soybean oil for May was little changed at 8,610 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
