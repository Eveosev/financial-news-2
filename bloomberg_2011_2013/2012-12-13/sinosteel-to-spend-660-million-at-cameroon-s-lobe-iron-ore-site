Sinosteel Corp., plans to spend $660 million at the Lobe iron
ore project in Cameroon, said Fang Gao, a spokesman for the
company.  Sinosteel Cam and the central African nation’s government
will sign a development deal for the project, 40 kilometers from
the seaside town of Kribi, where a port is being constructed,
