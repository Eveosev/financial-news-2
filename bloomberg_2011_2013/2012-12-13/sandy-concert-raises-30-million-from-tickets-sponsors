Last night’s concert to benefit
victims of Hurricane Sandy raised $30 million in ticket revenue,
sponsorships and corporate donations, according to the  Robin
Hood Foundation , which organized the event.  The group is counting donations made by telephone and over
the Internet, according to Patty Smith, a spokeswoman for the
organization. A more complete tally will be published by about
Dec. 17, she said.  The show at New York’s Madison Square Garden brought
together some of most popular U.S. and British acts, including
Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones,  Paul McCartney ,  Billy
Joel , Bon Jovi, the Who and Eric Clapton, to raise money for
victims of the October storm. President Barack Obama has asked
Congress for $60.4 billion to pay for damage caused by Sandy.  Additional funds will be raised through merchandise sales,
auctions of autographed items, CD and DVD sales, as well as
downloads of songs on  Apple Inc.’s (AAPL)  iTunes, Smith said.  “Those will take longer to come in and compile,” Smith
said. Before the concert, the Robin Hood Foundation had raised
$15.7 million for Sandy relief and granted $14.8 million to 140
organizations, she said.  The concert website,  121212concert.org , lists sponsors
including  General Electric Co. (GE) , Samsung Electronics Co., State
Farm,  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) ,  Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)  and the Verizon
Foundation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
