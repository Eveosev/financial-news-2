Euro-area finance ministers approved
49.1 billion-euro ($64 billion) of rescue payments to  Greece  to
keep the recession-wracked country solvent.  Finance chiefs at a meeting in Brussels today rubber
stamped the next tranches of aid after wrapping up a 14-hour
negotiation on banking union at 4:30 a.m. Of the funds, 34.3
billion euros will be released within the next few days with the
remaining money doled out in the first quarter.  “The disbursement agreed to today will allow for liquidity
to flow back into the  Greek economy ,” European Union Economic
and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said at a press
conference.  The Greek government this week said it plans to pay 11.29
billion euros to buy back 31.9 billion euros of bonds to reduce
its debt burden and retain the support of the EU and the
 International Monetary Fund . The buyback underscores a move away
from the austerity-first measures European leaders have embraced
since the financial crisis began in 2009.  To repurchase all the debt tendered, Greece needed approval
to spend more than the 10 billion-euro loan from Europe’s
bailout fund earmarked for the buyback.  To contact the reporter on this story:
