The  World Anti-Doping Agency  may
boycott a probe of the International Cycling Union’s
relationship with  Lance Armstrong  because of “significant
concerns” about the review panel’s ground rules.  WADA has been contacted by lawyers for a three-person panel
setup by the governing body to conduct an independent look into
Armstrong and his interaction with the organization known by its
French acronym, UCI.  In August, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, or USADA, stripped
the American rider of his seven Tour de France titles and banned
him for life for using prohibited substances after he opted not
to contest doping charges in arbitration. USADA’s stand was
upheld in October by the UCI.  The governing body’s leadership has been criticized in the
aftermath of the Armstrong affair for failing to act sooner, and
it set up the panel Oct. 22.  WADA has “some significant concerns about the commission’s
terms of reference and has alerted the lawyers representing the
commission of its concerns,” it said in an emailed statement
today. “If WADA’s concerns cannot be resolved as a result of
this meeting, WADA will consider seriously whether it can take
part in the commission’s process.”  WADA spokesman Terence O’Rorke declined to detail the
concerns the organization had with the UCI panel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
