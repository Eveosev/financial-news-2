Banco de Credito & Inversiones ,
Chile’s fourth-biggest bank, rose to seven-month high as
brokerage firm IM Trust included the lender in a list of
favorite stocks.  BCI advanced 3 percent to 32,800 pesos at 4:30 p.m. in
Santiago after earlier rising as much as 3.4 percent to the
highest intraday level since May 7. The country’s benchmark Ipsa
index fell 0.3 percent.  IM Trust, Chile’s sixth-biggest brokerage by value of
traded stocks, added BCI to its list of 10 favorite Chilean
stocks for December, according to a note to clients today.  “Valuation for the bank remains attractive versus its peer
group,” the report said.  The company’s stock price is  13.7 times  expected profits
for this year, compared with 14.8 for both Banco de  Chile  and
Banco Santander Chile, the country’s two biggest lenders,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
