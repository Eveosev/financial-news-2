Colombian bonds advanced after the
head of the country’s tax agency said the government was
discussing a compromise with lawmakers on proposals to reduce
taxes on foreigners’ bond profits.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
bonds due in July 2024 fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 5.98 percent at 9:17 a.m. in Bogota,
according to the central bank. The price rose 0.273 centavo to
132.895 centavos per peso.  The government is pressing lawmakers to reduce the  tax rate 
below the 25 percent they have proposed, Juan Ricardo Ortega,
head of the tax agency said today on Javeriana radio. The tax
rate now is 33 percent.  “The market is very much on the lookout for these
debates,” said William Florez, an analyst at Helm Bank SA’s
brokerage in Bogota. “The tone of it is getting more political
and less economic, and those political issues can generate a lot
of instability.”  Domestically issued bonds tumbled earlier this week after
congress proposed the 25 percent rate, above the 14 percent
level President  Juan Manuel Santos  advocated in November.  A surprise drop in Colombian consumer prices last month
means inflation at the end of 2013 may be below the 3 percent
mid-point of the central bank’s target range, Jose Dario Uribe,
the bank’s governor, said yesterday.  The bank could trim its 2013 forecast after measures of so-
called “core” inflation, which exclude volatile food and fuel
prices, slowed, Uribe said in an interview at the bank’s Bogota
headquarters. Policy makers’ current forecast is for prices to
rise 3 percent next year, in line with the target.  The peso was little changed at 1,794.64 per  U.S. dollar .  To contact the reporter on this story:
