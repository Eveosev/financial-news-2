Italian two-year notes rose for a
third day as the nation sold 3.5 billion euros of securities
maturing in 2015 as well as bonds maturing in 2026.  The two-year yield declined four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.06 percent at 10:23 a.m. London time. The
10-year yield was little changed at 4.63 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
