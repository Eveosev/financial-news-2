AS Tallink Grupp (TAL1T)  rose the most in
three years after a company that an Estonian newspaper said is
part of  Citigroup Inc. (C)  bought a stake, paying 42 percent more
per share than yesterday’s close.  The shares surged as much as 14 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since September 2009, and closed up 11.5 percent
at 0.862 euro in Tallinn. Volume of 1.25 million shares was 10
times the three-month daily average, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The OMX Tallinn equity index rose 3.5 percent to
726.20, the highest since April 2011.  Baltic Cruises Holding LP bought a 15.7 percent stake in
the Tallinn, Estonia-based company for 116.6 million euros ($152
million), or 1.1 euros a share, Tallink said today on the  Baltic
website  of the Nasdaq OMX exchange group.  The new shareholder is owned by Citigroup Venture Capital
International Growth Fund II, the Estonian business daily
Aripaev reported on its website today, without saying where it
got the information.  Baltic Cruises bought a combined 7.8 stake in Tallink from
two investment funds run by Citigroup, the ferry operator said.
It also bought shares from Firebird Republics Fund Ltd., Amber
Trust SCA and AS Infortar, which retain smaller stakes, it said.  CVCI Vice President Ashwin Roy is a member of Tallink’s
supervisory board, according to Tallink’s website. The website
of CVCI lists Tallink as part of its investment portfolio,
describing the Estonian company as “one of  Europe ’s largest and
most profitable ferry operators.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
