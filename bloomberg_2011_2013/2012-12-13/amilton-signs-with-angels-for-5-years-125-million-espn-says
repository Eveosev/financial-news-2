The Los Angeles Angels and
outfielder  Josh Hamilton  have agreed on a $125 million, five-
year contract, adding another former Most Valuable Player to
 Major League Baseball ’s best hitting team from last season, ESPN
reported.  The American League MVP in 2010 with the  Texas Rangers ,
Hamilton met with his former club as well as the  Seattle
Mariners  before agreeing with the Angels, the network said
yesterday, citing an unidentified person familiar with the deal.  It also quoted Rangers General Manager Jon Daniels as
saying he had been told by Hamilton’s agent that the player was
moving to the Angels. Angels spokesman Tim Mead declined to
comment on the report in a telephone interview.  “As per team policy and MLB rules, the Angels will not
comment on the status of any contract negotiations with
players,” the Angels said in a statement. “With that said, we
continue to look for ways to improve our team. As soon as we
have something formal to announce, we will do so.”  Hamilton, 31, joins an offense featuring three-time
National League MVP  Albert Pujols , who signed with the Angels
before last season on a 10-year deal worth between $250 and $260
million, and 21-year-old outfielder Mike Trout, who won AL
Rookie of the Year this season while finishing second in MVP
voting. The Angels batted .274 last season, the best in
baseball, and scored 767 runs, third in the AL behind the
Rangers and  New York Yankees .  “Wow,” Trout posted yesterday on his Twitter account
shortly after ESPN published its report.  Adding Hamilton would raise the Angels’ payroll to about
$165 million, MLB.com said. The  Los Angeles Dodgers  announced
the signing of All-Star pitcher Zack Greinke this week in a move
that has them poised to open the 2013 season with the highest
payroll in major league history, at more than $220 million.  World Series  Hamilton has batted .305 with 142 home runs and 506 runs
batted in during five seasons with the Rangers, helping Texas
reach the  World Series  in 2010 and 2011. Last season, he hit
.285 with a career-best 43 home runs and 128 RBIs.  The first pick in the 1999 major league draft, Hamilton’s
early career was interrupted by drug and alcohol abuse. The
Rangers hired a special coach to help Hamilton off the field and
he has had a number of public relapses since his major league
debut in 2007, including a case in February in which he
acknowledged having several drinks in a Dallas restaurant and
lying to a teammate about his actions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
