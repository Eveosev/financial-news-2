Germany and Britain remained
undecided in talks today on a European Union plan to prop up the
blocâ€™s carbon market, an EU official said today.  Support from the two may determine the fate of the proposal
to delay the sale of some carbon allowances to curb oversupply,
according to the official, who asked not to be identified,
quoting policy. Should they join the supporters, including
France and  Italy , the measure would pass the first round of the
policy making process, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
