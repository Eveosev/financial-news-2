Assore Ltd. (ASR) , a South African mining
investment company, extended its rising streak to four straight
days to a record high as investors showed their support for an
expansion of production capacity.  Assore  rose  1.1 percent to 400 rand at 5 p.m. in
Johannesburg, the highest since at least 1990 when Bloomberg
started tracking the stock. The number of shares traded was more
than two times the stock’s three-month average daily volume.  “It has ramped up production quite significantly and is
starting to see the benefits of that in its numbers,” Simon Fillmore, chief executive officer of Independent Securities
(Pty) Ltd., said by phone from Johannesburg. “That is the
fundamental reason why the share price has rallied.”  Assore’s main investment is a 50 percent joint venture with
 African Rainbow Minerals Ltd. (ARI) , called Assmang, which mines and
produces minerals such as  iron ore , manganese ore, ferrochrome
and ferromanganese. The company spent 4.5 billion rand ($400
million) on its operations in the year through June, including
1.3 billion rand on the expansion of Assmang’s Khumani iron ore
mine in  South Africa ’s Northern Cape province.  To contact the reporter on this story:
