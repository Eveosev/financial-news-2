Amgen Inc. (AMGN) , the worldâ€™s largest
biotechnology company, said it will increase its dividend 31
percent for the first quarter of 2013 and buy back an additional
$2 billion in shares.  Amgen will pay stockholders 47 cents a share on March 7,
the  Thousand Oaks , California-based company said today in a
statement. Amgen in July 2011 became the first biotechnology
company to pay a dividend. The current payment is 36 cents, and
analysts  estimated  an increase to 40 cents, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Amgen is looking for new products and  acquisitions  to boost
revenue as its former core anemia business declines. The company
on Dec. 10 said it had agreed to buy DeCode Genetics Inc., a
genetics research company, for $415 million. Earlier this year,
Amgen acquired Micromet Inc. for $1.16 billion to add an
experimental leukemia drug, signed a development deal with
London-based AstraZeneca Plc and boosted its presence in the
cancer market through sales of Xgeva, a bone drug that reduces
fractures.  The company also said it had authorized further share
repurchases with $500 million left to spend from its current $10
billion program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
