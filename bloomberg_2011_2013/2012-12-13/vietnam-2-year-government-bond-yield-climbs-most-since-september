Vietnam ’s two-year bonds fell,
pushing the yield up by the most since September, on speculation
banks pared holdings to replenish cash. The dong was steady.  The interbank overnight deposit  rate  has surged 258 basis
points, or 2.58 percentage points, to 4.29 percent this month,
signaling funding availability declined, according to daily
fixings by banks compiled by Bloomberg. Some lenders probably
sold securities to raise cash ahead of year-end, said Nguyen Duy Phong, an analyst at Viet Capital Securities.  “Banks invested so much in bonds that they need to cash
out to help maintain liquidity,” said Ho Chi Minh City-based
Phong. “The  interbank rate  indicates that the system needs a
little bit of liquidity.”  The yield on two-year bonds rose 10 basis points, or 0.10
percentage point, to 9.20 percent, according to a daily fixing
rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest jump
since Sept. 27 and the highest level since Nov. 26. The yield on
five-year bonds rose two basis points to 9.78 percent.  The dong was steady at 20,848 per dollar as of 2:01 p.m. in
Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its reference rate at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
