Swedish consumer prices fell for the
first time in three years in November on an annual basis as
central bank rate cuts sent mortgage costs lower and the
 European debt crisis  capped demand for Swedish exports.  Consumer prices fell an annual 0.1 percent compared with
growth of 0.4 percent the previous month,  Statistics Sweden  said
today. Prices were seen to stay unchanged according to a
Bloomberg survey of 10 economists. Prices fell 0.2 percent  on
the month .  Adjusted for mortgage costs , price gains slowed to an
annual 0.8 percent. Prices declined  a monthly  0.2 percent.  “The Riksbank will cut rates in December” as  Sweden  is
“heading towards deflation,” said Per Sellden, an analyst at
 Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  in a note before the report. “Inflation is already
at low levels and is expected to be low for a long time.”  The Riksbank in October signaled a 28 percent likelihood it
will cut  interest rates  for a fourth time in less than a year
next week as slowing demand for its products from  Europe  puts a
lid on economic activity in the largest Nordic country, which
exports about half of its output. About 70 percent of  exports  go
to Europe where countries are cutting spending to reduce debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
