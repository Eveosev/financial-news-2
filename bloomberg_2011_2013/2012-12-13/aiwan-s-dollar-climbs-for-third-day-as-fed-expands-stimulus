Government bonds  dropped, with
benchmark 10-year yields rising to the highest level in seven
weeks, after the  Federal Reserve  said it will expand asset
purchases that boost the supply of the greenback.  Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened for a third day after the Fed
said yesterday it will buy $45 billion a month of Treasuries
starting in January, in addition to $40 billion a month of
existing mortgage-debt purchases. Global funds bought $801
million more Taiwanese stocks than they sold in the past four
days, bringing net purchases this year to $4.9 billion,
according to exchange data. The island’s exports rose 0.9
percent in November from a year earlier, official data showed
Dec. 7, after dropping in seven of the previous eight months.  “The Fed’s new round of asset purchases boosted risk-on
sentiment,” said Sam Chang, a bond trader at Yuanta Securities
Co. in Taipei. “But the fact that the Fed keeps pushing out
stimulus programs shows the global economic recovery is still in
a pretty fragile state. The rise in yields will be limited.”  The yield on the government’s 1.125 percent bonds due
September 2022 climbed to 1.144 percent from 1.143 percent
yesterday, according to Gretai Securities Market. It touched
1.146 percent earlier, the highest level for benchmark 10-year
rates since Oct. 26.  The  Taiwan dollar  was steady at NT$29.101 against its U.S.
counterpart, according to data from Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency touched NT$28.959 on Nov. 12, the strongest level since
September 2011. It has appreciated 4.1 percent this year, the
fourth-best performance among  Asia ’s 11 most-used currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, dropped 15 basis
points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 3 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was 0.387 percent, a
weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center
shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
