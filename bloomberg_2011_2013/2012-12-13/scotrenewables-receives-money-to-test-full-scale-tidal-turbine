Scotrenewables Tidal Power Ltd., a
developer of turbines that use the tides to generate
electricity, received 7.6 million pounds ($12.3 million) from
investors including  Total SA (FP)  and  ABB Ltd. (ABBN) ’s venture capital arm.  Fred Olsen Ltd. contributed to the funding, which will
support the design, construction, installation and testing of
Scotrenewables 2-megawatt commercial-scale turbine, the Scottish
government said today in an e-mailed statement. The company will
use a grant from the government it received earlier in the year
for the project.  The company on Nov. 14 won rights to develop a 30-megawatt
project off the Orkney Islands in northern Scotland. While no
commercial-scale facilities are in operation, the government
estimates that energy from the waves and tides has the potential
to meet as much as 20 percent of Britain’s current electricity
demand. Scotland is estimated to have about a quarter of
 Europe ’s tidal resource.  To contact the reporter on this story:
