South Korean  stocks  rose, driving
the benchmark index to its steepest gain in three months, as
 Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  rallied to a record.  The Kospi index climbed 27.33 points, or 1.4 percent, to
2,002.77, its steepest gain since Sept. 14, with Samsung
accounting for 41 percent of the  increase . Samsung climbed 2.9
percent amid “solid” expectations for its smartphone business,
Korea Exchange Inc. said in a statement today. OCI Co. added 3.8
percent on speculation Chinese and U.S. demand will bolster the
solar industry.  More than a third of the Kospi’s point gain occurred in the
final  minute  of trading as futures and options contracts on
South Korean equities and stock indexes expired, an event known
as quadruple witching.  Kospi (KOSPI)  trading volumes were 12 percent
higher than the 10-day average, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Foreign investors were also net buyers of Korean stocks for an
eleventh day, according to Korea Exchange data today.  “Program buying on quadruple-witching day drove up shares
nicely,”  Lee Jin Woo, a fund manager at Seoul-based KTB Asset
Management Co., said by telephone today.  The Kospi gained 6 percent in the past month on optimism an
improving global economy will boost South Korean exports. U.S.
payroll figures reported on Dec. 7 and Chinese industrial
production data two days later beat economist estimates. The
Kospi gained 9.7 percent this year and trades at 11.1 times
estimated profit, the highest level since January 2011.  Handset Business  Samsung Electronics, whose market value surpassed $200
billion for the first time last week, rose 2.9 percent to
1,533,000 won. LIG Investment & Securities Co. and IBK
Securities Co. yesterday raised their share-price estimates,
citing improving prospects for earnings in 2013.  “Foreigners heavily snatched up Samsung shares today,”
said Lee Sun-Tae, analyst at NH Investment & Securities. “The
main reason behind this seems to be the company’s brighter
fourth-quarter earnings outlook, largely helped by its handset
business.”  OCI, South Korea’s biggest maker of polysilicon for solar
cells, rose 3.8 percent, the most since Sept. 14, to 164,500
won. The solar industry will gradually improve, Choi Ji Hwan, an
analyst at NH Investment & Securities Co., wrote in a report
today.  STX Pan Ocean Co. (028670) , South Korea’s largest dry-bulk ship
operator, climbed 6.7 percent to 3,990 won, the highest level
since Sept. 26. STX Group said it’s in talks to sell its
controlling stake in STX Pan Ocean.  To contact the reporter on this story:
