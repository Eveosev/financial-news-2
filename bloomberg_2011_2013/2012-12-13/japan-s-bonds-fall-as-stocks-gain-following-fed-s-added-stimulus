Japan’s bonds declined as the
 Federal Reserve ’s decision to expand asset purchases sent stocks
prices higher, sapping demand for the relative safety of
 government securities .  Yields on the benchmark 10-year notes rose to the highest
level in two weeks following losses in  U.S. Treasuries  after the
American central bank took the unprecedented step yesterday of
linking stimulus measures to unemployment and inflation. Japan’s
Ministry of Finance sold five-year notes today.  “There is selling in JGBs,” said  Takafumi Yamawaki , chief
rates strategist in Tokyo at JPMorgan Chase & Co., one of the 25
primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt sales.
“Investors are following the correction in Treasuries after the
Fed meeting.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note gained 3 basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 0.725 percent as of 3:13
p.m. in Tokyo, according to Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. The rate was the highest since
Nov. 28.  The 20-year rate rose 3 1/2 basis points to 1.695 percent,
matching the highest level since Oct. 31, while the yield on 30-
year bonds added 41/2 basis points to 1.940 percent.  Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 1.7
percent today. U.S. Treasuries fell for a third day, pushing the
10-year yield to 1.72 percent, the most since Nov. 7.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said yesterday it will
buy $45 billion a month of  Treasury securities  starting in
January to spur the economy. Interest rates will stay low “at
least as long” as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent and if
inflation is projected to be no more than 2.5 percent, the
central bank also said in a statement. The thresholds replace
the Fed’s earlier view that rates would stay near zero at least
through the middle of 2015.  A sale of 5-year Japanese government debt today saw bids
worth 3.54 times the 2.5 trillion yen ($29.9 billion) of
securities on offer today, compared with the so-called bid-to-
cover ratio of 4.96 in the last sale in November.  To contact the reporters on this story:
