CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) , the largest
provider of prescription drugs in the U.S., jumped the most in
three months after forecasting 2013 profit that topped analysts’
estimates, helped by new pharmacy customers.  Adjusted profit next year will be $3.84 a share to $3.98 a
share, Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based CVS said today in a
statement. The average estimate of 21 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey was $3.81.  Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo has increased marketing
and promotions to retain customers that it won when  Walgreen Co. (WAG) 
ended a contract to provide  Express Scripts Holding Co. (ESRX)  shoppers
with prescriptions. While Walgreen and Express Scripts have
renewed the agreement, CVS said last month it expects to keep at
least 60 percent of the customers it gained from the dispute.  CVS  rose  2 percent to $48.50 at the close in New York, the
biggest one-day gain since Sept. 13. The  shares  have increased
19 percent this year.  The company also today raised its quarterly dividend 38
percent to 22.5 cents a share. The first payout at the new level
will be payable Feb. 4 to shareholders of record as of Jan. 24.
The company plans to complete $4 billion in share repurchases
next year.  CVS last month said third-quarter net income rose 16
percent to $1.01 billion, or 79 cents a share. Profit excluding
some items was 85 cents a share, topping analysts’ average
estimate of 84 cents.  Retail pharmacy same-store sales increased 4.3 percent in
the quarter, helped by a “significant” benefit from former
Walgreen customers, CVS said.  Adjusted profit this year will be as much as $3.41 a share,
CVS said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
