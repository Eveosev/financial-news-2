Kenya ’s shilling gained for the
first time in three days on increased dollar inflows from the
sale of coffee and a record removal of domestic  money supply 
from the central bank.  The currency of east  Africa ’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 0.7 percent to 85.50 per dollar, the biggest gain
since July 30 and was trading less than 0.1 percent higher at
86.05 a dollar as of 12:53 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi.  Kenya’s benchmark coffee grade climbed for a third
successive sale, rising 9.9 percent to $400 for a 50-kilogram
(110-pound) bag, from $364 at the previous sale two weeks ago,
the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said by e-mail on Dec 11. Supplies
of the grade rose 62 percent to 2,105 bags with the average
price being $336.24 a bag compared with $323.97 at the previous
auction, the agency said. Markets were closed yesterday for a
public holiday.  “The shilling has received support from the flow of coffee
sales whose proceeds are flowing into the market today as
yesterday was a public holiday,” John Muli, a currency dealer
at Nairobi-based African Banking Corp., said in a phone
interview.  The  Central Bank  of Kenya used repurchase agreements to
remove 17 billion shillings ($200 million) from the banking
system in an a seven-day repo auction this week, a bank official
who declined to be named in line with policy said on the phone.
This is the highest amount offered since the bank started
removing money this year to support the shilling, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Ugandan shilling gained less than 0.1 percent to
2,679.50 a dollar, while Tanzania’s shilling was unchanged at
1,599 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
