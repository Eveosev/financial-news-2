Azerbaijan â€™s economic growth
accelerated in the first 11 months as a surge in non-energy
industries overcame a drop in oil production.  Gross domestic product advanced 1.2 percent between January
and November, compared with 0.2 percent in the year-earlier
period, the State Statistics Committee, based in the capital,
Baku, said today on its  website . The non-energy economy grew 9.7
percent, while the oil and gas industries shrank 6.5 percent.  Crude output in Azerbaijan, the largest oil producer in the
former  Soviet Union  behind Russia and Kazakhstan, dropped 7.4
percent in the first 11 months to 39.3 million metric tons,
State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, or Socar, said yesterday. Natural
gas production grew 12 percent to 26.58 billion cubic meters.  The  construction industry  grew 23.1 percent and information
technology services expanded 16.8 percent in the January-
November period, the statistics committee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
