The Czech government must make sure
that a unified banking supervision within the European Union
won’t allow transfer of local savings abroad, Premier Petr Necas
wrote in an opinion column in the  Lidove Noviny  newspaper.  Czech taxpayers can’t be asked to save troubled banks in
 Europe , Necas said in the column published today.  The Czech Republic is trying to secure a guarantee that its
domestic banking supervisor, the central bank, will have a
decisive say if a foreign bank seeks to turn its operations into
a branch from a subsidiary, which is subject to stricter local
regulation, Necas told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
