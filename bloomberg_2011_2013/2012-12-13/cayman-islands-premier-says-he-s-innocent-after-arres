Cayman Islands  Premier McKeeva Bush
said he’s innocent of corruption charges and will remain in his
post while on bail.  “I have done nothing wrong and I shall not be resigning as
premier,” Bush said in a statement e-mailed by his office. “I
also wish to assure one and all that the government continues to
operate as normal.”  Bush, 57, was arrested Dec. 11 and faced two days of
questioning from police, who also confiscated computer equipment
from his home in West Bay. Police said Bush was released
yesterday and will remain on bail until February while their
investigation continues.  Bush, who took office in 2009 and is known as “Father of
the House” for his almost three decades of service in the
country’s parliament, was arrested for misuse of a government
credit card, conflict of interest and importing explosive
substances, according to police. Bush said he could not comment
any further at this time “on the advice of my attorney and
given the circumstances.”  The Cayman Islands, a British Overseas Territory which has
the highest number of  hedge funds  in the Caribbean, has
historically attracted companies such as Bain Capital LLC and
Medtronic Inc. The nation was home to 10,979 funds as of Sept.
30, up from 9,258 in 2011, according to the country’s monetary
authority.  In a statement released after Bush’s arrest, the British
Governor’s office said that Cayman police will “carry out a
robust, fair and comprehensive investigation, regardless of the
individual concerned.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
