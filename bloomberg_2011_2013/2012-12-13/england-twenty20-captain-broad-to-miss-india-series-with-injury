England  Twenty20 captain Stuart Broad will miss next week’s two-match series in  India  with a
bruised left heel, the England and Wales Cricket Board said on
its website.  Broad had a scan two days ago and was ruled out of
England’s final Test in the series with India, which began today
in Nagpur. The England board said that the 26-year-old fast
bowler will immediately return home for rest and rehabilitation.  Eoin Morgan will replace Broad as captain in the Twenty20
series, which will be played Dec. 20 and 22, with James Harris
joining the squad. Harris, 22, will be making his international
debut.  Fast bowler Steven Finn will also return to the U.K. after
missing the final Test with a strained disc in his lower back.
He’s expected to be ready for next month’s one-day series
against India, the  England board said .  To contact the reporter on this story:
