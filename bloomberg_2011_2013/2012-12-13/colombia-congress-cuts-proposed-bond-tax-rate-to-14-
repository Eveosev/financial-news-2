Colombian lawmakers cut the proposed
tax on foreigners’ bond profits to 14 percent, from a previous
proposal of 25 percent, in draft legislation being debated in
Congress, Senator Juan Mario Laserna said in an interview today.
The tax is currently 33 percent.  The modification would return the proposed rate to the
level President  Juan Manuel Santos  advocated in November. Bonds
tumbled on Dec. 11, pushing yields up the most in a year, after
lawmakers said they wanted to cut the rate to 25 percent, rather
than 14 percent. Congress is also debating a 5 percent tax on
dividends exceeding 100 million pesos ($56,000), which are
currently untaxed, Laserna said.  Colombia  is looking to reduce yields in the $83 billion
local  debt market  by attracting more foreign investors with a
tax cut, Public Credit Director Maria Fernanda Suarez said in an
interview last month. The yield on Colombia’s government peso
bonds, known as TES, due in 2024 fell to a record low this
month, as investors bet the  tax cut  would entice foreign buyers.  “A 14 percent rate would be very favorable for TES,”
Daniel Velandia, the head of research at Correval SA brokerage
in Bogota, said in a telephone interview.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
bonds due in July 2024 fell four basis points today, or 0.04
percentage point, to 5.97 percent, according to the central
bank. It has fallen 163 basis points this year. The yield may
drop to 5.6 percent or 5.7 percent early next year if the rate
is cut to 14 percent, Velandia said.  Angel Custodio Cabrera, the lawmaker who had proposed the
25 percent rate, said in a phone interview today that he has
agreed to the 14 percent level.  Colombian lawmakers will allow extra sessions for debate on
the bill, extending the time available to vote on tax reform
legislation beyond the previous deadline of Sunday,
congressional president Roy Barreras told lawmakers in Bogota
today.  The  tax rate  should be 25 percent for investors from
countries considered  tax havens , and 14 percent for investors
from “normal” tax jurisdictions, Laserna said.  The currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 1,796.75 per  U.S.
dollar  at the close in Bogota.  To contact the reporters on this story:
