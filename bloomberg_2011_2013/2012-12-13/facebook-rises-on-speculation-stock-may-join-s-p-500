Facebook Inc. (FB)  advanced the most in
two weeks after the stock joined the Nasdaq-100 Index and
analysts speculated that it will soon be included in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Shares of  Facebook  rose 3.2 percent to $28.46 at 10:50 a.m.
in New York, and earlier touched $28.49 for the biggest intraday
gain since Nov. 29. Through yesterday, the stock had climbed 56
percent since falling to a record on Sept. 4.  Facebook joined the Nasdaq-100 yesterday, replacing the
Indian consulting firm  Infosys Ltd. (INFO) , a move that may attract
buyers for exchange-traded funds and other products linked to
the index. There’s a greater than 50 percent chance that
Facebook will also be added to the  S&P 500  in 2013, according to
Victor Anthony, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets Inc.  Inclusion in the S&P, along with efforts to introduce a
search engine and make money from the Instagram photo service,
“should all lead to a banner 2013 for Facebook,” Anthony wrote
in a research report today.  Through yesterday, the stock was still down 27 percent
since Facebook sold shares at $38 apiece in an initial public
offering in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
