Endo Health Solutions Inc. said
Chief Executive Officer David Holveck will retire in May or when
his successor is found, whichever comes first.  Endo, the maker of the painkiller Lidoderm, also announced
that annual earnings would be “at or below” the low end of its
 forecast  of $5 a share to $5.10 a share and it “no longer
expects to achieve” revenue next year of $3 billion to $3.2
billion. Endo will update its forecast in January, the  Chadds
Ford , Pennsylvania-based company said in a statement.  The company had disruptions in its supply of the Opana ER
painkiller, Endo’s second-biggest product, that reduced its
sales in the third quarter. Endo also is preparing for generic
competition to its top-seller Lidoderm in September 2013.  Holveck, 67, has been CEO since April 2008. The search firm
Korn/Ferry will assist Endo’s board is seeking a new chief
executive officer, the company said yesterday in the statement.  Endo has made “significant progress” during Holveck’s
tenure, including diversifying to reduce its dependence on
Lidoderm,” Roger Kimmel, Endo’s chairman, said in the
statement. “We are moving quickly and have already begun a
comprehensive search for our next CEO.”  Shares of  Endo fell 3.4 percent to $26.65 at the close of
