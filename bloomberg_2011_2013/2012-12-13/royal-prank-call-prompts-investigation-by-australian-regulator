Southern Cross Media Group Ltd. (SXL) ’s
Today FM Sydney Pty will be investigated over possible breaches
of broadcast rules after presenters made a hoax call to a
hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was treated for morning
sickness.  The probe of the Sydney-based station will focus on rules
on decency, privacy, demeaning treatment of interviewees and
consent for use of recorded interviews covered in its broadcast
license and radio codes, the Australian Communications and Media
Authority said in a  statement on its website .  On Dec. 10, Southern Cross canceled the Hot 30 show that
aired the prank call, after a nurse who answered the phone at
the hospital was found dead. Today FM, which broadcast Hot 30,
faces sanctions from mandatory staff training to cancellation of
a broadcast license, should the probe find violations, the
regulator said.  “The ACMA will be examining whether the licensee has
complied with its broadcasting obligations,” Chris Chapman, the
regulator’s chairman, said in the statement.  For the prank, presenters Mel Greig and Michael Christian
impersonated  Queen Elizabeth II  and Price Charles in a phone
call to  London ’s King Edward VII hospital seeking details about
the health of  Kate Middleton , the pregnant wife of the heir to
the British throne.  Southern Cross  suspended advertising on its network this
week after companies pulled their ad spending.  The broadcaster and publisher fell 0.5 percent to A$1.05 at
1:02 p.m. in Sydney trading, while the S&P/ASX 200 index rose
0.1 percent. The stock price is 5.4 percent less than its level
before the death of the nurse, Jacintha Saldanha, last week.  Today FM, also known as 2Day FM, already has special
conditions attached to its broadcasting license after separate
breaches of regulations by Kyle Sandilands, who presents the
station’s morning show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
