Nigeria’s naira rose, snapping three
days of declines, after the central bank increased its supply of
dollars at an auction.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer gained less
than 0.1 percent to 157.7 a dollar as of 11:20 a.m. in Lagos,
the commercial capital. The naira has advanced 2.9 percent this
year, the second-best performer in Africa, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sells dollars to lenders at
twice-weekly foreign-currency auctions to help manage the
 exchange rate . The regulator  increased  the amount of dollars it
sold yesterday to $180 million, the most in two weeks, from $66
million on Dec. 10.  The naira’s appreciation this year could be traced to tight
monetary conditions, improved supply of foreign exchange to the
market by  oil companies  and increased inflows from portfolio
investors, central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi said Nov. 20
after the regulator held its benchmark rate at a record-high 12
percent.  Yields on 10-year naira debt fell five basis points to
11.89 percent, according to yesterday’s prices compiled on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Borrowing costs
on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021
declined one basis point to 4.15 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi gained 0.1 percent to 1.8934 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
