Eni SpA (ENI) ,  Italy ’s biggest oil
company, was granted a 20 percent cut in a European Union fine
for colluding on prices of a synthetic rubber used to make
diving equipment, shoe soles and condoms.  The EU General Court in Luxembourg reduced the company’s
fine to 106.2 million euros ($138.8 million) from 132.2 million
euros in a ruling today. The legal reasoning was kept
confidential at the parties’ request.  The European Commission, the EU’s antitrust watchdog, in
December 2007 levied a total of 247.6 million euros on Eni and
four competitors for carving up the market for chloroprene
rubber, which is used to make latex rubber. The illegal cartel
lasted from at least 1993 to 2002. Eni got the biggest fine for
being a repeat offender.  German drugmaker  Bayer AG (BAYN)  was given  full immunity  from a
201 million euro fine in the case because it told the Brussels-
based commission about the cartel. The EU court in separate
rulings in February rejected appeals by  DuPont Co. (DD) ,  Dow Chemical
Co. (DOW) , and  Denki Kagaku Kogyo KK (4061)  against their fines in the
cartel. DuPont and Dow have since appealed to the EU’s top
court.  DuPont was fined 15 million euros and Dow 4.4 million euros
individually. In addition, they got a joint penalty of 44.3
million euros for their former joint venture. Dow Chemical
transferred its stake in the joint venture to Wilmington,
Delaware-based DuPont in 2005 and it was renamed DuPont
Performance Elastomers LLC.  The commission didn’t immediately respond to a call and e-
mail seeking comment on today’s decision.  The case is: T-103/08, Versalis and Eni v. Commission.  To contact the reporters on this story:
