Airlines are on track for their
safest-ever year after the loss-rate for western-built jets fell
54 percent in the first 11 months compared with a year earlier,
the International Air Transport Association said.        Aircraft from manufacturers including Airbus SAS,  Boeing
Co. (BA)  and  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  suffered 0.19 “hull loss” accidents
per million flights during the period, IATA said today.  Across the airline industry, the rate of accidents
involving losses or damage for planes built by all manufacturers
was 2.14 per million flights, the organization said at a Geneva
briefing, continuing a downward trend since 2008.  Safety at African carriers deteriorated, with 12.69 losses
per million flights, 57 percent worse than a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
