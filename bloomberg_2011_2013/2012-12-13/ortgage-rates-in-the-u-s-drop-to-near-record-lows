U.S. mortgage rates fell, decreasing
borrowing costs after more Americans applied for home loans.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.32
percent in the week ended today, down from 3.34 percent, McLean,
Virginia-based  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  said in a statement. The average 15-
year rate slipped to 2.66 percent from 2.67 percent.  Home prices  are rising as low  interest rates  bolster demand
for a shrinking supply of properties. A measure of home-loan
applications increased 6.2 percent in the week ended Dec. 7, the
Washington-based Mortgage Bankers Association said yesterday.
The group’s  purchase  gauge gained 0.7 percent to the highest
level in a year, and its  refinancing  index jumped 8 percent.  “Stronger mortgage demand suggests that would-be buyers
are growing in confidence,”  Paul Diggle , property economist for
Capital Economics Ltd. in London, wrote in a note to clients on
Dec. 11. “Nevertheless, mortgage lending will continue to be
held back by tight credit.”  Home prices climbed 6.3 percent in October from a year
earlier, the biggest jump since June 2006 and the eighth
consecutive increase on a year-over-year basis, according to
CoreLogic Inc., an  Irvine , California-based data firm.  The average 30-year mortgage rate dropped to a record 3.31
percent last month, according to  Freddie Mac .  To contact the reporter on this story:
