Ugandan President  Yoweri Museveni 
said foreigners are interfering inappropriately in the country’s
oil industry.  Some politicians and non-governmental organizations who
opposed a clause that gave the energy minister the right to
issue and revoke licenses were funded by “foreign interests,”
the Ugandan leader said today in a televised address to
parliament in Kampala, the capital.  “These people are spreading lies acting on behalf of
foreign interests,” Museveni said. “Foreigners always get it
wrong.”  A petroleum authority will be established to handle oil
licenses under plans passed on Dec. 7. A moratorium on new
licenses is to be lifted, Energy Minister Irene Muloni said by
phone that day.  Oil companies  are undermining Uganda’s interests by their
opposition to building a refinery and and one company, which he
didn’t identify, underestimated the level of the nation’s
reserves, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
