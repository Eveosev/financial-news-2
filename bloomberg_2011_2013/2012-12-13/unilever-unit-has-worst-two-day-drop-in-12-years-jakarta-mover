PT Unilever Indonesia (UNVR) , a unit of the
world’s second-largest consumer goods company, posted its worst
two-day slump in 12 years in Jakarta trading after a series of
downgrades and target price cuts by five brokerages.  Unilever  Indonesia  sank 11 percent to 20,550 rupiah as of
12 p.m. local time after tumbling 11 percent yesterday when the
company said it will pay higher royalties to its parent Unilever
NV. The stock was the biggest drag on the Jakarta Composite
index, which lost 0.7 percent.  Erwan Teguh, Jakarta-based analyst at CIMB Group Holdings
Bhd., downgraded the stock to underperform and cut his share-
price estimate by 35 percent to 20,000 rupiah. The company’s
move to pay higher royalties has damaged its “pristine
corporate governance,” he wrote in a note dated yesterday.  “The company mentioned the change in royalty structure is
to strengthen its position as the exclusive Indonesian arm of
its parent,” Octavius Oky Prakarsa, analyst at PT Mandiri
Sekuritas, said in a client note today. “We are doubtful. We
may see this as another way to maximize returns of its Indonesia
investment.” He reduced his rating to sell from neutral.  The stock’s two-day slump, the worst since August 2000, has
sliced more than $4 billion off the company’s market value. It’s
the second-worst performer in the Jakarta Composite index in the
past five days. Trading volume was more than six times its
three-month daily average.  Unilever Indonesia said yesterday before the market opened
that total royalties to  Unilever NV (UNA)  would increase to 5 percent
of its revenue beginning next year from 3.5 percent now.
Katarina Setiawan, analyst at PT Kim Eng Securities, cut
her target price for Unilever Indonesia to 23,400 rupiah from
26,350 rupiah, she wrote in a research note today. Credit Suisse
Group AG lowered its share-price estimate to 15,725 rupiah from
18,800 rupiah yesterday, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. JPMorgan Chase & Co. reduced its target to 20,000
rupiah from 22,000 rupiah.  To contact the reporter on this story:
