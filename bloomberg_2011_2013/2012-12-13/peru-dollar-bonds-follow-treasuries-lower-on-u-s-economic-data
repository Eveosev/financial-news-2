Peru ’s dollar-denominated bonds
fell, following U.S. Treasuries lower as a gain in U.S. retail
sales damped the appeal of  government securities  as a haven.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 6.55 percent bonds due in
2037 climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.73
percent at 4:04 p.m. in Lima, the highest level since Nov. 20,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s price
dropped 0.50 cent to 144.75 cents per dollar.  Retail sales rebounded in November and applications for
jobless benefits fell more than analysts forecast last week,
bolstering the growth outlook for the world’s largest economy.  The sol was little changed at 2.5640 per  U.S. dollar ,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. Peru’s central bank
bought $80 million in the spot market today, paying an average
2.5653 soles per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
