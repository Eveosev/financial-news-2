Nordic grid operators say the
European Union’s plans to raise contributions to its
infrastructure fund may restrict or paralyse cross-border power
trading.  “The proposal will cut cross-border trading, and may
thwart it completely in the worst case,”  adding costs of
between 30 and 40 kroner ($5.3 to $7.1) to each megawatt-hour of
electricity that  Norway  imports or exports, Bente Hagem,
executive vice president at Norway’s grid operator, Statnett SF,
said today by e-mail from Oslo.  The European Agency for the Cooperation of Energy
Regulators, known as ACER, has  suggested  the bloc’s fund should
be boosted as much as 16-fold to 1.6 billion euros ($2.1
billion), so that transmission system operators would receive
more compensation for costs of hosting cross-border flows.  Together with Statnett, Nordic grid companies Svenska
Kraftnaet AB, Fingrid Oyj and Energinet.dk oppose the EU
proposal, saying it would deter electricity trade and
infrastructure investments, in a joint letter sent to ACER,
dated Nov 26., seen by Bloomberg.  The EU needs to boost cross-border power shipments and
build new international links so that countries with excess
hydropower, solar and wind production can ship their surpluses
to countries where demand is high. This would boost  energy
security  and pave the way for more renewable energy penetration,
according to the European commission.  Under ACER’s proposal, Statnett, which now contributes 100
million kroner a year to the EU’s fund, would see costs increase
six- or eight-fold, deterring Norway from building planned
electricity cables to  Germany  and the U.K., according to the
company.  Norway is considering three cross-border links of 1,400
megawatts each to help export power surpluses that the country
is unable to absorb.  ACER may present its recommendations for legislative action
to the EU Commission by March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
