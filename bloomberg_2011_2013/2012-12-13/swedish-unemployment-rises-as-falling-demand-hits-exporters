Swedish  unemployment  rose more than
expected in November as companies in Nordic region’s largest
economy cut jobs because of falling sales abroad.  The seasonally adjusted unemployment rose to 8.1 percent,
from 7.7 percent the previous month, the Stockholm-based
statistics office said today. The rate  was predicted  to rise to
7.8 percent, according to the median estimate of nine economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The  non-seasonally adjusted rate  rose to
7.5 percent from 7.1 percent.  Swedish unemployment will rise to an average 8.4 percent
next year from 7.7 percent in 2012 as  economic growth  slows to
0.8 percent this and next year from 3.9 percent in 2011 because
of falling demand for the Nordic country’s exports, Nordea Bank
AB predicted on Dec. 5.  Ericsson AB (ERICB) , the world’s largest maker of mobile phone
networks, and truck maker Volvo AB, are among exporters who have
announced job cuts in  Sweden . Sweden sells about half of its
output abroad, of which about 70 percent go to  Europe  where
countries are cutting spending to reduce debt.  Sweden’s non-seasonally adjusted, trended rate, as measured
by the  number of people claiming benefits , remained at 4.6
percent in November, the Stockholm-based Public Employment
Service said today. That was in line with the median forecast of
five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
