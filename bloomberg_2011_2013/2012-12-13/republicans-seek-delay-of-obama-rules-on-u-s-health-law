Senator  Orrin Hatch  and nine other
Republicans asked for a delay of new U.S. rules for health-
insurance exchanges and other parts of the Affordable Care Act,
saying the public isn’t being given enough time to comment.  The 30-day comment period on the regulations makes it
“extremely burdensome, if not nearly impossible, to formulate
an accurate and instructive response,” the senators said in a
letter today to the U.S. health, treasury and labor secretaries.
The period should be extended to at least 60 days, they said.  The Obama administration has released four regulations
guiding development of state-run health-insurance markets that
add a total of 704 pages of new rules costing about $900
million, the senators said. Three of the regulations were held
by the White House since August and released only after
President  Barack Obama ’s Nov. 6 re-election, with 30 days to
comment, the senators said.  “Such haste raises concerns that politics are being put
before policy,” the senators said in their letter.  Politics didn’t influence the timing of the rules, Gary Cohen, who directs the U.S. health agency’s Center for Consumer
Information and Insurance Oversight, said today at a hearing in
Washington.  Once the government formally decides to implement a
regulation, individuals, companies and other institutions are
given time to voice their opinions and recommendations before
the new rules take effect. This comment period typically lasts
30 to 90 days and can lead to changes in the regulation to
address concern raised by the public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
