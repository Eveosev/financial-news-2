SacOil Holdings Ltd. (SCL) , a South
African oil and gas company, won an exploration license in
Malawi, pushing the shares up the most in almost two months.  SacOil will search for oil in Block 1, an area spanning
about 12,200 square kilometers (4,700 square miles) in the
northwest of the country, the Johannesburg-based company said
today in a statement to the city’s stock exchange.  International investors including  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and
Total SA have raced to tap East Africa, where Tullow Oil Plc
made Kenya’s first oil discovery this year and  Anadarko
Petroleum Corp. (APC)  previously announced the decade’s biggest gas
find off Mozambique. The region’s resources have also drawn oil
companies to Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia.  SacOil rose 6.5 percent to 33 cents in Johannesburg
trading, the biggest one-day gain since Oct. 15.  The four-year exploration license can be renewed twice for
three-year periods as results are evaluated, according to the
statement.  “This is in line with SacOil’s strategy of building and
developing a uniquely African portfolio,” Chief Executive
Officer Robin Vela said in the statement. “It gives effect to
our drive to unlock underexplored regions in Africa.”  SacOil also has an exploration license in the  Democratic
Republic  of Congo and blocks in  Nigeria , according to the
company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
