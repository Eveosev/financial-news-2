The Czech current-account deficit
widened in October and was worse than analysts forecast as the
outflow of dividends outweighed the foreign-trade surplus, the
central bank said.  The  current-account  shortfall totaled 16.1 billion koruna
($833 million), after a deficit of 7.3 billion koruna in
September, the Prague-based central bank said in a statement on
its website today. The reading compared with the median  forecast 
of a 2 billion-koruna surplus in a Bloomberg survey of 12
analysts.  Dividend payments from direct investments in the  Czech
Republic  totaled 20.2 billion koruna in October, the bank said.
The goods and services balance was in a surplus, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
