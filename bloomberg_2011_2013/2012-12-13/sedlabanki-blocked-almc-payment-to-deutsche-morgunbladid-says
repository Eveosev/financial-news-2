Iceland’s central bank blocked a 10
million-euro ($13.1 million) bond payment from ALMC hf to
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Morgunbladid newspaper reported today, without
saying where it obtained the information.  Sedlabanki will only approve the payment if the Reykjavik-
based  asset management company , the parent company of Straumur
Investment Bank hf, sells 25.6 million euros worth of assets in
exchange for kronur, Morgunbladid reported. The central bank’s
requirement follows ALMC breaching capital control regulation,
according to the  newspaper .  To contact the reporter on this story:
