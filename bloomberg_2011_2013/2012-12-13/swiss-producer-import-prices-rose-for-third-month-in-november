Swiss  producer and import prices 
rose for a third month in November from a year earlier, led by
higher domestic costs.  Costs for products ranging from factory to farm goods as
well as imports advanced 1.2 percent from November last year
after climbing an annual 0.4 percent in October, the Federal
Statistics Office in Neuchatel,  Switzerland , said today.
Economists forecast a gain of 1 percent, the median of five
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed. Prices were
unchanged in the month.  Import costs fell 0.4 percent in the month and increased
0.7 percent from a year earlier, todayâ€™s report showed. Producer
prices advanced 0.1 percent in the month and climbed 1.5 percent
in the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
