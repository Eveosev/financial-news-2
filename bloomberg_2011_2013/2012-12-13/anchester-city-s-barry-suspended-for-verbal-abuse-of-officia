Manchester City midfielder Gareth
Barry was suspended one game by  England ’s Football Association
for verbal abuse of a match official.  Barry admitted to using abusive and/or insulting words
following City’s 3-2 loss to rival Manchester United four days
ago, the F.A. said in a statement on its website. The defeat
left the defending Premier League soccer champion in second
place, six points behind United.  Barry, who was also fined 8,000 pounds ($13,000), and City
both said on the club’s website they “reluctantly” accepted
the punishment. Barry will miss this weekend’s match against
Newcastle and will be available for a game against Reading on
Dec. 22, the club said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
