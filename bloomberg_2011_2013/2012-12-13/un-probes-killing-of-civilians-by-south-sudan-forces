The United Nations is investigating
the deaths of nine civilians during clashes between
demonstrators and South Sudanese security forces.  The demonstrations took place in Wau, the capital of
Western Bahr El Ghazal state, on Dec. 8 and Dec. 9, the  UN
Mission in South Sudan  said today in an e-mailed statement. The
army clashed with protesters opposed to plans to transfer the
administrative headquarters from Wau to Baggari, according to a
UN humanitarian bulletin released yesterday.  “The recent escalating tensions and the episodes of
violence, as well as attacks on property, are of great
concern,” the UN mission said. “UNMISS is investigating the
use of force and other reports of violence in order to establish
the facts behind these tragic events.”  The mission said it’s offering assistance to the
government, which established a fact-finding committee on Dec.
11. Government spokesman Barnaba Marial Benjamin did not answer
phone calls today seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
