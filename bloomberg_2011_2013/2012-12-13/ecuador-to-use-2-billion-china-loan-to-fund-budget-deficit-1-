(Corrects to say financing needs in second paragraph of
story first published Dec. 12.)  Ecuador, home to South America’s
third-largest oil reserves, will finance its 2013  budget deficit 
with a $2 billion loan from China, Finance Minister  Patricio Rivera  said today.  The government will use the loan to help cover financing
needs of $6 billion next year, Rivera said today in a joint news
conference with President  Rafael Correa  in Quito.  Correa has relied on windfall oil profits and loans from
China to help finance spending since Ecuador’s $3.2 billion bond
default in 2008 and 2009 locked the nation out of global credit
markets. As  oil prices  rose this year to an average $95.69 per
barrel, about $16 more than forecast in Ecuador’s 2012 budget,
the country scrapped a planned bond sale and put a previously
announced $1.7 billion credit line from China on hold.  “We already had an agreement with the People’s Republic of
China for a payment that we haven’t had to use this year,”
Rivera said at the presidential palace in  Quito . “Originally,
it was $1.7 billion. They raised it a little in the negotiation
process and now it’s $2 billion.”  Ecuador will use loans tied to specific public works
projects from regional multilateral lenders to cover the
majority of its 2013 financing needs, Rivera said, without
providing more details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
