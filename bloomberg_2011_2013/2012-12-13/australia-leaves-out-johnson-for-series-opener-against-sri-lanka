Australia left out  Mitchell Johnson 
and recalled fellow fast bowlers Peter Siddle and Ben Hilfenhaus
for the series-opening cricket Test against Sri Lanka starting
tomorrow in Hobart.  Mitchell Starc and spinner Nathan Lyon were the other
specialist bowlers named for the first of three matches against
the Sri Lankans, who failed to win any of their previous 10
Tests in Australia.  “It was a tough selection to leave Mitchell Johnson out,
but it’s a nice problem to have when you’ve got 12 blokes who
really want to play and have performed well,” Australia captain
Michael Clarke said in a televised news conference.  Shane Watson  will bat at No. 4 following the retirement of
Ricky Ponting after last week’s Test series defeat to South
Africa, with the recalled  Phil Hughes  taking the No. 3 spot in
the order.  Australia hosts Sri Lanka in two further matches in
Melbourne and Sydney.  AUSTRALIA: David Warner, Ed Cowan, Phil Hughes, Shane
Watson (vice-captain), Michael Clarke (captain), Mike Hussey,
Matthew Wade, Peter Siddle, Mitchell Starc, Ben Hilfenhaus,
Nathan Lyon.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
