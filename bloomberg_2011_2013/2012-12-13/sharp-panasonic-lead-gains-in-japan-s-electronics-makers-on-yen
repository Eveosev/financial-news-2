Sharp Corp. (6753)  and  Panasonic Corp. (6752)  led
gains among Japanese electronics makers in  Tokyo  trading as the
yen weakened against the euro and dollar, boosting investor
optimism that the companies’ projected losses may narrow.  Sharp rose 6.4 percent to 250 yen at the close on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, the highest since Aug. 2, and bringing its gain
in the past 30 days to 64 percent. Panasonic  added  7.9 percent,
the most since July 2009, to 481 yen, extending its advance
since Nov. 13 to 25 percent.  The yen has fallen 5 percent against the dollar and lost
about 8 percent versus the euro in the past month as opposition
leader Shinzo Abe called for a doubling of the inflation goal
set by the  Bank of Japan (8301)  to revive economic growth. A weaker yen
boosts the value of Japanese electronics makers’ overseas
revenue when repatriated.  “The yen’s move is a tailwind for companies including
Sharp and Panasonic,” said  Mitsuo Shimizu , a Tokyo-based
analyst at  Iwai Cosmo Holdings Inc. (8707)  “Investors focus on large
companies when the yen fuels expectations for earnings recovery
in the whole market.”  The yen touched 83.67 per dollar, the weakest since March
20, before trading at 83.59 as of 3:43 p.m. in Tokyo. It was at
109.46 per euro, the least since April 4.  Sharp expects a net loss of 450 billion yen in the year
ending March 31, while Panasonic projects a loss of 765 billion
yen, according to figures released separately by the Osaka-based
companies.  Sharp, which said last month that there was doubt about its
ability to survive, generated about 23 percent of sales from the
 Americas and Europe  in the year ended March 31, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Panasonic got about 22 percent of
revenue from these regions, the data showed.  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Japan ’s largest exporter of consumer
electronics, gained 6.4 percent to 886 yen, the biggest advance
since Feb. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
