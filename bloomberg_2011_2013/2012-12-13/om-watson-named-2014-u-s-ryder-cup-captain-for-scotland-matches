Tom Watson , an eight-time major golf
champion, was named captain of the 2014 U.S. Ryder Cup team as
the American team will try to rebound from this year’s final-day
collapse.  Watson will be 65 when the matches are played at the
Gleneagles Hotel in Perthshire,  Scotland , making him the oldest
U.S. captain.  Sam Snead  was 57 when he led the U.S. team in
1969.  The winner of five British Open titles and the U.S. captain
in the biennial tournament between teams of U.S. and European
golfers in 1993, Watson was named to the post during a segment
this morning on the “Today” show on  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC
network, which televises the golf matches.  “I was waiting for about 20 years to get the call,”
Watson said. “I loved it the first time. It’s a great honor to
be able to do it again. This time we need 14 1/2 points. I’m a
stage manager. I just hope I can set the stage for these players
to perform their act.”  Watson also was captain in 1993, leading the U.S. to its
most recent win in  Europe . Since 1981, the U.S. has prevailed in
only two matches on foreign soil. Watson is the first repeat
captain since  Jack Nicklaus  in 1987.  The U.S. lost this year’s three-day matches at Medinah
Country Club outside Chicago 14 1/2 to 13 1/2 as Europe equaled
the 13-year-old U.S. record for the biggest comeback in the
competition’s history. Europe entered the final day trailing 10-
6 and outscored the U.S. 8 1/2 to 3 1/2 in 12 final-day singles
matches.  Of Watson’s five British Open wins, four came in Scotland.
He played on U.S. Ryder Cup teams that won three times and tied
once, posting a 10-4-1 individual record, and missed capturing
the 2009 British Open at Turnberry in Scotland at age 59 when he
lost in a playoff to  Stewart Cink .  To contact the reporter on this story:
