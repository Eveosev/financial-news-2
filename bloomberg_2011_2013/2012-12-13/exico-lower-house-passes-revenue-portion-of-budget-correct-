(Corrects Pena Nieto’s prior revenue figure in second
paragraph.)  Mexico ’s lower house of Congress
voted today to raise the revenue portion of the nation’s 2013
budget by lifting the price estimate for oil exports and
boosting income expected from taxes.  Mexico’s government will earn 3.96 trillion pesos ($310
billion) next year, the lower house’s finance committee said in
an e-mailed statement. In approving the budget, the lower house
increased the price-per-barrel of crude exports to an estimated
$86 from the $84.90 President Enrique Pena Nieto had proposed
last week. The adjustment helps lift revenue from the originally
planned 3.93 trillion pesos.  Pena Nieto’s government on Dec. 7 presented a proposal to
return the deficit to zero after Congress approved shortfalls in
recent years, overriding Mexican law requiring a balanced
budget, as the nation sought to recover from the 2009 recession
and global financial crisis. The revenue portion of the budget
now heads to the Senate as Congress has until Dec. 31 to approve
the nation’s spending and income packages for next year.  Additional revenue will come from higher than originally
estimated earnings from income taxes of 818.1 billion pesos
rather than 815.8 billion pesos and from value-added taxes of
622.6 billion pesos, up from 617.9 billion pesos, according to
the house committee statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
