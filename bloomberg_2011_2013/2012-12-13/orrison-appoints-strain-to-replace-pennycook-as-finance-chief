William Morrison Supermarket Plc (MRW) ,
the smallest of the four main U.K. grocery chains, said Trevor
Strain will replace Finance Director Richard Pennycook.  Strain, who joined the company in 2009 and is corporate
finance director, will be appointed to the main board in June,
the Bradford, England-based retailer said today in a statement.
Strain will take over responsibilities for finance, audit and
information technology before his departure at that time.  Pennycook is leaving the business after almost eight years
at the grocer. Strain previously worked at larger rival Tesco
Plc as U.K property finance director and then as planning and
reporting finance director before joining Morrison.  To contact the reporter on this story:
