Baloise Holding AG (BALN) ,  Switzerland ’s
third-biggest insurer, said Jan De Meulder will oversee a cost-
cutting program when he takes over as chief executive officer of
its German business next month.  De Meulder, 57, will replace Frank Grund, who is pursuing
new “professional opportunities” after nine years as head of
Basler Versicherungen, the Basel-based insurer said today in a
statement. While De Meulder will remain on the corporate
executive committee, Baloise CEO Martin Strobel will take on his
role as head of the corporate division international.  “We are now in a position to take the next step towards
optimizing the business in our key German market,” Strobel said
in the statement. “Basler Versicherungen in  Germany  will reduce
costs and increase levels of efficiency.”  The cost-cutting program at the insurer’s second-biggest
unit comes as Baloise’s merged German businesses start operating
under the Basler Versicherungen brand from Dec. 21. The company
will announce the size of the cost cuts, which will include some
jobs losses, at the end of March, said Strobel.  “Germany is part of our core business and we will focus on
profitable growth, particularly in the marine business,
technical insurance, and  life insurance  selling unit-linked
products,” Strobel said today in an interview.  Strobel will also take over from De Meulder as chairman of
Baloise’s supervisory board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
