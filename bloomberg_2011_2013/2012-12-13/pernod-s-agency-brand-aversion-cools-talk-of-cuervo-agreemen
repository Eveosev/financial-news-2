Pernod-Ricard SA (RI) , France’s biggest
distiller, said it doesn’t plan to take on “agency brands” in
the Americas, cooling speculation that it may take over  Diageo
Plc (DGE) ’s distribution agreement for Cuervo tequila outside Mexico.  “I don’t see that agency brands are the way forward for
us,” Philippe Dreano, the head of the company’s Americas unit,
said today on a call with analysts. Agency brands are typically
beverages that distillers distribute for other drink-makers in
markets where they may have a stronger sales force.  Larger competitor Diageo said Dec. 11 it abandoned talks to
buy Jose Cuervo and will seek to end its 26-year-old
distribution agreement. That spurred speculation among analysts
including Laetitia Delaye at Kepler Capital Markets in Paris
that Pernod may take on distribution of the brand.  “We have no plan concerning agency brands,” Dreano said
today. He didn’t directly comment on Cuervo.  Pernod’s largest agency brand is in  Brazil , the executive
said, where the company sells Teacher’s whisky for  Beam Inc. (BEAM) 
Distillers derive less profitability from such brands compared
with wholly owned brands, he said. There is “no strategic
need” for any agency brands in Pernod’s own range of drinks in
the Americas, which includes Chivas Regal Scotch whisky and
Absolut vodka, among others, according to Dreano.  “We have a quite comprehensive portfolio, scale in most
markets, and the job we have to do now is to grow organically
what we have,” Dreano said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
