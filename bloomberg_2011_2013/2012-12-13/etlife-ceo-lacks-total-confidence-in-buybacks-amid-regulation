MetLife Inc. Chief Executive Officer
 Steven Kandarian  said looming regulation means he lacks “total
confidence” that the insurer will able to complete its plan to
repurchase $8 billion of shares from 2014 through 2016.  “As things unfold here in terms of regulatory oversight,
we’ll have to wait and see,” Kandarian said today on a
conference call with analysts. “This will not be totally within
our control.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
