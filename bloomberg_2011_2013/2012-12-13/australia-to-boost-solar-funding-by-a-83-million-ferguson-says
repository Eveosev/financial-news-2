Australia  will boost funding for
solar research and development by A$83 million ($88 million) in
an initiative supported by the U.S. government, Resources
Minister Martin Ferguson said.  The funding, part of the United States-Australia Solar
Energy Collaboration, includes A$33 million for the U.S.-
Australia Institute for Advanced Photovoltaics, Ferguson said
today in an e-mailed statement. It will also contribute A$35
million to the Australian Solar Thermal Research Initiative, he
said.  Projects that will receive money under the plan include the
development of an Australian Solar Energy Forecasting System
that will improve the integration of solar energy generation,
and a device that simplifies using solar energy for hybrid
fossil-fuel applications, Ferguson said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
