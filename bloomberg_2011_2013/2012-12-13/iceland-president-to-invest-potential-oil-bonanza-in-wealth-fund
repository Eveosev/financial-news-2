Iceland plans to set up a national
wealth fund to safeguard revenue from potential oil discoveries
as it opens up the island nation to exploration, President
Olafur R. Grimsson said.  Faroe Petroleum Plc (FPM) ,  Valiant Petroleum Plc (VPP)  and Petoro AS
will be the first foreign explorers to search Icelandic waters
for oil and gas. They are betting that the geology matches that
of the Shetland Islands, where BP Plc and Total SA are drilling,
according to Faroe.  “Since we look at this resource as a national wealth,
there will be a national wealth fund that would be established,
but this is more of a general policy at this time,” Grimsson
said in an interview in  London  this week. Explorers “have to do
their work. It will take some years.”  Iceland’s $14 billion economy will get a boost from any oil
discoveries as it recovers from the 2008 banking meltdown that
plunged the nation into its worst recession in six decades.  It plans to cooperate with the member states of the  Arctic
Council  to prevent oil spills in the North Atlantic and share
equipment and technology for search and rescue operations.  Future oil industry regulations will be “within the
framework of the Nordic as well as European cooperation,”
Grimsson said. They will be modeled on  Iceland ’s geothermal and
hydropower industry, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
