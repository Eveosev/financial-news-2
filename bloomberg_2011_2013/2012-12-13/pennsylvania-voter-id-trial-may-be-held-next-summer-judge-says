A trial over the constitutionality
of  Pennsylvania â€™s voter-identification law will probably be held
next summer, a judge said.  A trial may be set for July with a decision by mid-August,
Commonwealth Court Judge Robert Simpson said today during a case
conference in Harrisburg, the state capital. That would set the
stage for the case to continue until the November election with
an appeal to the state Supreme Court.  Simpson in October barred enforcement of the law for the
presidential election, ruling that while election officials
could request an ID, voters without them could still cast
ballots that would be counted.  Pennsylvania is one of nine states that passed laws requiring 
each voter to show a state-issued ID before casting a ballot.
Seventeen states enacted statutes requiring voters to present some 
kind of photo ID. Just two states had voter-ID laws before 2008.  Simpson said he will rule later on whether to extend the
injunction against enforcement of the law for the May election.  The case is Applewhite v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
330-md-2012, Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania (Harrisburg).  To contact the reporter on this story:
