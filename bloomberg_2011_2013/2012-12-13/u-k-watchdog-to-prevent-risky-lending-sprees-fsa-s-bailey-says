The U.K.’s financial watchdog will
intervene to prevent sudden surges of risky lending before they
happen, the U.K.’s top banking regulator said.  The  Prudential Regulatory Authority , which will take over
from the Financial Services Authority in April as the U.K.’s
banking supervisor, will “keep a very close eye on banks,” and
require them “to have very clear lending policies,”  Andrew Bailey , head of banking and insurance supervision at the FSA,
said in a video interview on the Bank of England’s website.  “If there’s a spree of lending which looks like it’s being
done to people or companies that we doubt could repay that
lending, we’d aim to stop that before it happens,” said Bailey,
who will also lead the new regulator.  Lending growth has remained slow despite the FSA relaxing
guidance on how U.K. banks calculate liquidity and capital
buffers, Bailey said in a  speech  in October. Earlier this year,
the FSA relaxed the amount of funds U.K. banks must keep in
reserve in an effort to spur lending and stimulate credit
growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
