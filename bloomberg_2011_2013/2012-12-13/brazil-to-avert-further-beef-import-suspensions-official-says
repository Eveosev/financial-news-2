The Brazilian government’s
explanations of an animal death that could be attributed to mad
cow disease will be enough to avoid any more suspensions of beef
imports, an official said today.  Japan ,  China  and South Africa confirmed to Brazilian
authorities a ban on Brazilian beef imports, Enio Marques, head
of the agriculture defense secretariat, said in an interview.  “We have sent information to every country that requested,
and the response we got was more positive than expected,”
Marques said by telephone from Sao Paulo. “We have talked to
Russia, Venezuela and  Egypt  and I can assure that there is no
suspension in any of those countries.”  Brazil has been the biggest meat exporter since 2008,
according to the country’s Agriculture Ministry. Russia, Egypt
and Hong Kong are the biggest importers, according to data from
the Trade Ministry website. The Agriculture Ministry said Dec. 7
that tests on a 13-year-old cow that died in the Parana state in
2010 showed it carried the “causing agent of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy.” The animal didn’t develop the disease, nor did
the agent cause its death, according to the Ministry.  “After our explanations, the lifting of suspensions is
just a matter of internal country bureaucracy,” Marques said.
 Brazil  is still recognized “as having a negligible” mad cow
risk by the World Organization for Animal Health, known as OIE,
according to the organization’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
