Connecticut Water Service Inc. (CTWS) ,
which completed the acquisition of a water company this week to
expand in the U.S. Northeast, said the issuing of new shares to
help pay debt will raise about $43.1 million.  That’s more than twice the price paid for the $19.8 million
acquisition of Biddeford and Saco Water Co. in  Maine . The
Clinton, Connecticut-based water provider said proceeds from
about 1.48 million shares priced at $29.25 each would pay down
short-term borrowings and be used for corporate purposes.  The stock  fell  7.5 percent to $29.29 yesterday, the most
since August 2011, on more than three times the average 3-month
daily volume. The water company’s shares have now risen 8
percent this year compared with a 13 percent gain by the 18-
member Bloomberg World Water Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
