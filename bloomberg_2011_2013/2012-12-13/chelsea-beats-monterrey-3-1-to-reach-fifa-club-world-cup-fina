Chelsea defeated Monterrey 3-1 to
advance to the final of the FIFA Club World Cup in  Japan .  Juan Mata and Fernando Torres scored and Monterrey’s Darvin
Chavez put the ball into his own net to give European champion
Chelsea the win in Yokohama. Aldo De Nigris scored in the 90th
minute for the Mexican club. The Blues will meet Corinthians of
 Brazil  for the title Dec. 16.  “We know Corinthians is a very good team, one of the best
in South America,” Mata said in an interview with the British
Broadcasting Corp. “It will be a football party and hopefully
we win.”  Chelsea is aiming to give  Europe  a sixth straight title at
the annual competition, which is contested by the champions of
each continent’s soccer federation.  “For us, this is a very important tournament,” Mata said.
“We want to win the trophy and be world champions.”  Mata opened the scoring in the 17th minute with a left-
footed shot after taking a pass from Ashley Cole inside the
penalty area.  The Blues doubled their lead just 20 seconds into the
second half as Torres’s shot deflected into the net off a
defender. It was 3-0 two minutes later as Mata’s centering pass
was put in for an own goal by defender Chavez.  De Nigris then scored a consolation goal for Monterrey, the
champion of the North and Central America and Caribbean region,
in injury time.  The Mexican club will play African champ Al-Ahly in the
Dec. 16 third-place match. Egypt’s Al-Ahly lost 1-0 to
Corinthians in yesterday’s first semifinal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
