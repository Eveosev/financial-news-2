Facebook Inc. (FB) , owner of the world’s
largest social network, said it unveiled an upgraded mobile
application for phones and tablets running on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s
Android operating system that will make the program run faster.  Facebook, using a new approach with code to create the
software, aims to make it quicker and easier for users to open
the app, view photos or post comments, said Frank Qixing Du, an
engineer on the Facebook for Android team, in a  note  on the
site. The company also added a story banner to show the latest
posts, no matter where users are in their news feeds.  “This new release creates a solid foundation for the
Facebook for Android app moving forward,” Qixing Du said. “The
infrastructure in place will let us continue to make the app
even faster, smoother, and feature-rich.”  The company is focusing on mobile services as more users
access the social network from wireless devices instead of
through the traditional desktop-computer version. Facebook’s
number of mobile users jumped to 604 million in the third
quarter, up 61 percent from a year earlier. The company had more
than 1 billion total active members.  The new Android application follows an upgrade to its
counterpart for  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and iPad tablet, which was
announced in August. Speed was a focus for that update as well.  Shares of the  Menlo Park , California-based company  rose  2.4
percent to $28.24 at the close in New York. Facebook stock has
fallen 26 percent since its initial public offering in May, when
it sold shares for $38 apiece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
