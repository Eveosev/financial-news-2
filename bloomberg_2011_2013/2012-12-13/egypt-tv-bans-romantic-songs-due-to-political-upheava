Egypt  has banned the broadcasting of
any “romantic” songs or video clips on its 23 state-owned
channels, only allowing “patriotic” music, the state-run Ahram
Arabic website said.  Only patriotic tunes “that are worth broadcasting” will
be allowed, al-Ahram reported today. Sarcastic songs mocking
public figures will be also banned because of the
“sensitiveness of the political situation,” it said.  Egyptians will begin voting on Dec. 15 in a referendum on a
draft constitution that has polarized voters and led to weeks of
violent protests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
