Puerto Rico  had its debt rating cut
two levels today by Moody’s Investors Service, to one step above
speculative grade, according to a spokeswoman for the
commonwealth’s fiscal agent.  Moody’s cited Puerto Rico’s “weak economic environment”
and unfunded pension liability for the downgrade, Ana Maria
Gregorio, a spokeswoman for the Government Development Bank for
Puerto Rico, said in an interview.  The credit grade is now Baa3.  David Jacobson , a Moody’s
spokesman in New York, didn’t immediately respond to a phone
call and e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
