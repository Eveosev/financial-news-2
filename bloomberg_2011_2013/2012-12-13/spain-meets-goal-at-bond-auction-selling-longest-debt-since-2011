Spain  sold 2.02 billion euros ($2.64
billion) of debt, including the longest-maturity bond it has
auctioned for more than a year, as the Treasury seeks a funding
buffer for next year.  The Treasury met its maximum target for the sale of 2
billion euros, lower than its usual goals of at least 3 billion
euros. The average yield for the three-year benchmark bond was
3.358 percent compared with 3.39 percent on Dec. 5. The yield
fell to 4.2 percent for the five-year benchmark from 4.766 on
Oct. 4 and was 5.893 percent on the 2040 bonds.  Spain has completed the debt sales it planned for this year
and started raising funds for 2013, buying time for Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy  as he decides whether to seek a European
bailout. Bond prices fell after the auction, the last sale of
long-term securities this year.  “It wasn’t terribly ambitious but it’s year-end; people
are very averse to taking more risk onto their balance sheet and
the market has been behaving very well going into the auction,”
Mohit Kumar, head of European rates strategy at Deutsche Bank
AG, said in a phone interview. “There’s a lot of concern about
2013, whether Spain will ask for aid.”  Demand was 4.81 times the amount sold for the 2015 notes,
up from 2 on Dec. 5, and the ratio for the 2017 bonds rose to
3.13 from 2.47 on Oct. 4. The bid-to-cover ratio was 2.09 for
the 2040 bonds.  Bond yields initially fell today after European finance
ministers reached a deal to centralize banking supervision in a
move aimed at severing the link between banking troubles and
sovereign debt. After the sale, the yield on the  10-year
benchmark bond  rose to 5.38 percent from 5.34 percent
beforehand.  That compares with a euro-era record of 7.75 percent on
July 25, a day before the  European Central Bank  first signaled
willingness to help lower sovereign borrowing costs and a day
after Spain’s government signed conditions for a 100 billion-
euro European credit line to recapitalize its banks.  The Treasury, which returns to the market on Dec. 18 for
the last time this year to sell bills, said Dec. 11 it has sold
111 percent of its planned 2012 mid- and long-term issuance.  Spain plans gross debt issuance of 207 billion euros next
year, up from 192 billion planned for 2012. It also plans to
raise 23 billion euros on behalf of the regions, as most remain
locked out of financial markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
