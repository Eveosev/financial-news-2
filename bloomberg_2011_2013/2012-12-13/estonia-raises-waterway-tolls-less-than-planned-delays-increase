Estonia’s Parliament approved a
lower increase in waterway tolls than initially planned and
postponed the raise by six months after criticism from business
leaders it would harm competitiveness and investment climate.  The lawmakers voted 50-32, with one abstaining, late
yesterday in Tallinn to back the changes that combine present
fees into a single toll for using Estonia’s waterway network and
raise the fee to cover investment costs. Still, they reduced by
as much as half, depending of vessel types, the initial plan to
raise tolls by up to six times, and postponed the increase to
next July from January.  Fyodor Berman, the main owner of the largest Baltic
shipbuilder BLRT Grupp AS, and Arnout Lugtmeijer, chief
executive officer of terminal operator Vopak E.O.S., among other
business leaders, in October criticized the draft plans, citing
“extreme instability in the business environment” and an
“atmosphere of unpredictability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
