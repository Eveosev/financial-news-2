Structured notes that don’t protect
investor principal are likely to be the top sellers in the U.S.
next year, according to a poll by Incapital LLC.  Thirty-one percent of 94 attendees at the firm’s 2012
Structured Investments Conference in October said securities
without principal guarantees would be the “most popular,”
according to a survey released yesterday by Incapital, the
largest U.S. structured note underwriter that doesn’t issue the
securities.  Trailing at 25 percent were principal-protected notes,
followed by inflation-linked securities at 19 percent and
market-linked certificates of deposit, which are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. up to $250,000, at 13 percent.  More education would make structured products more popular
with investors, 60 percent of respondents said, while 20 percent
cited greater liquidity and 16 percent simpler structures.  U.S. investors have bought $37.3 billion of structured
notes this year, 15 percent less than the year-earlier period,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Data on the structured
CD market is incomplete as the investments aren’t registered
with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the FDIC doesn’t
track market-linked deposits separately.  To contact the reporter on this story:
