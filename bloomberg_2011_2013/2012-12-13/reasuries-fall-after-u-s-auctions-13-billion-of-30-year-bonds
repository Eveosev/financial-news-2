Treasuries fell for a third day as a
decline in U.S. unemployment-insurance claims and a gain in
retail sales sapped demand at the government’s auction of $13
billion of 30-year bonds.  Losses were tempered by concern a budget standoff may push
the  U.S. economy  into recession. The sale drew a  yield  of 2.917
percent, the highest since May, versus a 2.889 percent forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey of six of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21
primary dealers. Long bonds had  erased losses  just before the
auction after U.S. House Speaker  John Boehner  said President
 Barack Obama  isn’t serious about resolving the fiscal stalemate.  “The market got ahead of itself before the bid,” said  Jim Vogel , head of agency-debt research at FTN Financial in  Memphis ,
 Tennessee . “There remains continued optimism that the economy
will be better next year as long as headwinds die down.”  The yield on the current  30-year bond  increased two basis
point, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.91 percent at 5 p.m. in
New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It reached
2.93 percent earlier, the highest level since Nov. 2, before
touching 2.88 percent. The 2.75 percent security due in November
2042 fell 10/32, or $3.13 per $1,000 face amount, to 96 29/32.  Yields on the benchmark  10-year note  rose three basis
points to 1.73 percent. They touched 1.74 percent, the highest
since Nov. 7.  Recession Prospect  Stocks slid as U.S. lawmakers from both political parties
expressed renewed pessimism today about the prospects for
resolving the budget struggle before more than $600 billion
automatic in tax increases and spending cuts start taking effect
in January. The  Congressional Budget Office  has said that if
nothing changes, the stalemate probably would lead to a
recession.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped as much as 0.9
percent, snapping a six-day winning streak.  At today’s auction, the  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing total bids with the amount of securities
offered, was 2.5, versus an average 2.61 at the past 10 sales.
The ratio was 2.77 percent at the November sale, the highest
level this year.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 33.7 percent of the notes. That
compared with 45.4 percent of the notes at the November sale,
the most since April 2011, and an average for the past 10
offerings of 33.9 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 20.3 percent,
the most since June., versus 12.4 percent at the last sale and
an average of 14.9 percent at the past 10.  Value Questioned  “There are some people questioning the value of sub-3
percent 30-year yields,” said Jason Rogan, director of U.S.
government trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based
brokerage for institutional investors. “Still, until we get a
better idea about the economy and the fiscal cliff, the market
is going to stay relatively well bid.”  Thirty-year bonds have returned 3 percent this year,
compared with a 2.3 percent gain in the broader U.S. Treasuries
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Today’s auction was the last of three Treasury note and
bond offerings this week totaling $66 billion. The U.S. sold $21
billion of  10-year debt  yesterday at a yield of 1.652 percent
and auctioned $32 billion of three-year notes on Dec. 11 at a
record-low yield of 0.327 percent.  Next Auctions  The government will sell next week $35 billion in two-year
notes, an equal amount of five-year securities, $29 billion in
seven-year debt and $14 billion in five-year Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities. The auctions will be on four consecutive
days beginning Dec. 17.  Bonds fell earlier after initial claims for  unemployment
benefits  in the U.S. declined more than forecast and retail
sales increased, adding to signs of resilience in the world’s
largest economy.  Applications for jobless  benefits  fell by 29,000 to 343,000
in the week ended Dec. 8, the fewest since reaching a four-year
low in the period ended Oct. 6, Labor Department data showed. A
Bloomberg survey forecast 369,000.  U.S. retail sales increased 0.3 percent in November, after
dropping 0.3 percent the previous month, Commerce Department
figures showed today in  Washington .  Bonds dropped yesterday amid speculation inflation will
rise after the Fed said it plans to buy $45 billion of U.S.
government securities each month from January. Policy makers
also took the unprecedented step of linking stimulus measures to
unemployment and inflation.  The purchases will follow the expiration at year-end of
Operation Twist, a $667 billion program in which the central
bank has sold about $45 billion in short-term Treasuries each
month and bought an equal amount of longer-term debt.  To contact the reporters on this story:
