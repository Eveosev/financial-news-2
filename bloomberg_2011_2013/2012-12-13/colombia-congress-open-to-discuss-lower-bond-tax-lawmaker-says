Colombian lawmakers remain open to
discussing a bill that will cut the tax rate on foreigner’s bond
profits, even after they changed the original proposal, said
Angel Custodio, a member of the Lower House.  The bill as it currently stands would reduce the tax to 25
percent from 33 percent, above the 14 percent originally
proposed by President  Juan Manuel Santos ’s administration.  Lawmakers raised the proposed levy on concern increased
inflows would fuel gains in the peso and following requests for
lower income taxes and higher taxes on capital, said Custodio,
who proposed the change to 25 percent.  “We’ll look to see if a change is made,” said Custodio.
“You want to balance investments to compete with the world.”  Colombia is looking to reduce yields in the $83 billion
local  debt market  by attracting more foreign investors with the
proposed  tax cut , Public Credit Director Maria Fernanda Suarez
said in an interview last month. Bonds plunged Dec. 11 after
lawmakers scaled back the government’s tax-reduction proposal.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent debt due in July 2024
fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.98
percent at 10:20 a.m. in Bogota, according to the country’s
central bank. The bond’s price rose 0.273 centavo to 132.895
centavo per peso.  To contact the reporters on this story:
