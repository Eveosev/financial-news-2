Germany ’s Federal Cartel Office said
it’s concerned about hospital operator Asklepios Kliniken GmbH’s
intention to raise its stake in rival  Rhoen-Klinikum AG (RHK) , whose
shares climbed 1.6 percent.  Asklepios’s plan to increase its holding to as much as 10.1
percent would impose a blocking stake on Rhoen and endanger
competition and patient choice, particularly around the central
German city of Goslar, the agency said.  “Especially because there’s no price competition in this
industry that’s heavily influenced by the state, there must be a
measure of choice for patients,” Andreas Mundt, the president
of the cartel office, said in an e-mailed statement.  The federal agency gave the companies affected an
opportunity to respond to its concerns and said it will reach a
decision in mid-January of next year.  Asklepios blocked an attempt by Fresenius SE earlier this
year to buy Rhoen after announcing it had acquired a 5 percent
stake. Two days later, Fresenius said the 3.1 billion-euro ($4.1
billion) bid had failed because only 84 percent of Rhoen shares
had been tendered. Combining Fresenius’s Helios hospital unit
with Rhoen would have cemented its position atop the German
market, leaving Asklepios as the second-biggest operator.  Rhoen shares rose 24 cents to 15.60 euros after earlier
rising as much as 3.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
