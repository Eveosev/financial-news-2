Harbinger (HRG)  Group Inc., the holding
company run by  Philip Falcone ,  fell  the most on record after his
hedge fund sold shares in the company at a discount.  Harbinger declined 27 percent to $7.50 at 3:05  p.m. in  New
York . Harbinger Capital Partners Master Fund I Ltd., Harbinger
Capital Partners Special Situations Fund LP and Global
Opportunities Breakaway Ltd. sold 20 million shares at $7.50
each, Harbinger Group said today in a statement.  Falcone didn’t immediately return a telephone call seeking
comment.  Before today, Falcone and his funds held 129.9 million
Harbinger shares, or about 68.9 percent of the company’s common
stock, assuming the conversion of preferred shares, according to
filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Falcone set up Harbinger Group as a holding company that he
could use to tap public debt and stock markets in order to fund
investments in companies engaged in six different industries,
ranging from insurance to consumer products and power
generation. Harbinger Group owns a majority stake in  Spectrum
Brands Holdings Inc. (SPB) , a maker of batteries, pet food and lawn
care products.  Jefferies & Co. and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. underwrote the
stock sale. They have an option to purchase another 3 million
shares from Falcone’s funds for the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
