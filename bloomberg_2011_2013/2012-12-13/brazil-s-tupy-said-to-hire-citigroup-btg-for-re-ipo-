Tupy SA (TUPY4) , the largest foundry in
 Latin America , hired  Citigroup Inc. (C) , Grupo BTG Pactual, Banco
Itau BBA SA and  Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3)  to lead an equity offering of
1 billion reais ($482 million), according to three people with
direct knowledge of the matter.  Tupy, whose initial public offering was in 2002, envisions
the sale for sometime next year as a so-called re-IPO that
boosts trading volume by increasing the number of shares
outstanding, according to the people, who asked not to be
identified because the discussions are private.  Investors in Tupy, the world’s largest maker of cast-iron
cylinder blocks, traded as few as 100 shares with a total value
of 3,160 reais on Feb. 9 this year, and the  average daily value 
for 2012 is 449,000 reais ($215,000), according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That compares with an average daily trading value
of $9.82 million for  Kurimoto Ltd. (5602) , the Tokyo-based foundry
that’s less than  half the size  of Tupy based on market
capitalization.  Tupy, based in the Brazilian city of Joinville in Santa
Catarina, has a market value of 2.78 billion reais with a so-
called free float of 4 million shares out of the total 56.8
million outstanding, the data show. The shares, which gained 75
percent this year, rose 0.02 percent to 48.76 reais in Sao Paulo
trading yesterday.  Because liquidity for the existing shares is so low, the
current share price isn’t considered a benchmark for where the
new offering would be priced, the people said.  Biggest Investors  Previ, the pension fund for employees of government-owned
Banco do Brasil, and BNDES Participacoes SA, a unit of the
Brazilian  development bank , are the controlling shareholders of
Tupy, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. They each have
stakes of almost 36 percent.  Tupy has two manufacturing plants. One is in Joinville with
a production capacity of 445,000 metric tons per year and the
other is in Maua, in the greater Sao Paulo area, with capacity
for manufacturing 95,000 metric tons annually, according to the
company’s website. It has 9,000 employees.  Tupy this year completed the acquisition of two metal
processing plants in the Mexican cities of Saltillo and Ramos
Arizpe from Grupo Industrial Saltillo for about $439 million,
the company said in a regulatory filing.  Officials at Tupy, Citigroup, BTG, Banco do Brasil and Itau
BBA declined to comment on the equity sale, and asked not to be
identified because of company policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
