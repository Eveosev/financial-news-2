CLP Holdings Ltd. (2) ,  Hong Kong  biggest
electricity supplier, fell the most in more than four years
after selling HK$7.6 billion ($981 million) of shares at a
discount to finance power projects.  The  stock  declined as much as 5.1 percent to HK$63.80, the
most since Dec. 2, 2008, and traded at HK$65.15 as of 11:17 a.m.
in Hong Kong. CLP offered as many as 120.3 million shares at
HK$63.25 apiece, 5.9 percent less than its closing share price
of HK$67.20 yesterday.  The share sale comes as CLP’s Indian and Australian
businesses have stalled in the past year, and tariff increases
in Hong Kong haven’t kept pace with higher fuel costs, according
to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.  “Nothing is getting better in markets such as Hong Kong,
Australia and  India ,” said  Michael Parker , a senior analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in Hong Kong. “Now they may raise $1
billion through equity sales, but they are going to face the
same problems going forward.”  The stock has declined 1.5 percent this year, compared with
a 22 percent gain for the  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)  The benchmark index
climbed for a third day yesterday, extending its highest close
since August 2011, on speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will
announce another round of quantitative easing.  The proceeds will be used for “investment in the Hong Kong
electricity business, such as in infrastructure related to gas
supply from the mainland, and in additional generating capacity
in those markets where the group is already present,” CLP said
in the statement.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., UBS AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
are arranging the sale, according to the statement.  CLP, which estimated 2012  capital spending  at HK$7.88
billion, plans to raise net charges for electricity in Hong Kong
by 5.9 percent in 2013 because of higher fuel costs, the company
said Dec. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
