Panasonic Corp. (6752)  started solar-panel
production at a plant in  Malaysia  to meet “robust” demand in
 Japan , the company said in a statement today.  The plant, with an annual capacity of 300 megawatts, will
also make wafers and solar cells and increase the company’s
total module production capacity to 900 megawatts, according to
the statement. The facility is located in the Kulim Hi-Tech Park
in the state of Kedah.  Apart from Malaysia, Panasonic makes solar cells at two
plants in Japan. It makes modules in Japan and in Hungary,
according to the statement.  Panasonic  said  on Oct. 31 it won’t invest further in the 45
billion-yen ($538 million) Malaysia plant after the company
forecast a 765 billion-yen loss in the year ending March 31 even
as an incentive program for clean energy spurs demand for solar
panels in Japan.  The company stopped module production in  Mexico  at the end
of August to consolidate operations, according to spokeswoman
Chieko Gyobu. She declined to comment on the number of jobs
affected or the size of the plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
