The European  Central bank  said that
while borrowing costs have dropped, they continue to vary
greatly across the euro area and banks remain hesitant to lend
to the private sector.  “The cost of short-term bank lending to euro area non-
financial corporations has declined since early 2012, mainly
reflecting the pass-through of reductions in key ECB interest
rates and market interest rates,” the Frankfurt-based ECB said
in its monthly bulletin today. “Still, borrowing costs continue
to vary greatly across euro area countries, reflecting
differences in banks’ funding conditions and country-specific
economic developments affecting the creditworthiness of
borrowers,” it said. Lending to the non-financial private
sector “remains weak.”  ECB President  Mario Draghi  in September announced an
unlimited bond-buying program, saying the bank’s record-low
interest rates aren’t reaching borrowers because of unjustified
fears of a euro breakup. Since then, bond yields in countries
like Spain and  Italy  have fallen.  “In autumn 2012, net issuance of long-term debt securities
by banks resident in the euro area was significantly less
negative than it had been in previous months,” the central bank
said today. “At the same time, interbank trading volumes remain
low and concentrated in the shortest maturities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
