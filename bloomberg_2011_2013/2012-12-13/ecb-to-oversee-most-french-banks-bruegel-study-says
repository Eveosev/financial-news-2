(Corrects spelling of Sousa in third paragraph.)  The  European Central Bank  will
monitor most French banks under thresholds agreed upon early
today, according to a  study  from the Brussels-based Bruegel
Research Group.  European Union finance ministers agreed to give the ECB
direct oversight of banks whose balance sheets have more than 30
billion euros ($39 billion) in total assets or represent more
than 20 percent of their home country’s economy.  Bruegel researchers Guntram Wolff and Carlos de Sousa said
91 percent of euro-area banking assets and at least 180 firms
would be captured under the terms of the agreement. For most
countries in the 17-nation currency bloc, more than 80 percent
of banking assets would be covered, Bruegel said.  “Notable exceptions are Portugal, Malta, Greece,  Estonia ,
Slovenia and Slovakia,” the Bruegel study said. “In Slovakia,
no bank would be under the direct oversight of the ECB,
according to our database, while in France almost 100 percent of
assets are covered.”  Today’s deal says the ECB generally will take on the top
three banks in each participating nation. EU Financial Services
Commissioner  Michel Barnier  said he expected the ECB would have
day-to-day oversight of about 200 banks once it starts
operations in 2014.  To contact the reporters on this story:
