Natural gas futures fell to the
lowest price in almost 11 weeks after a government report showed
that U.S. stockpiles increased unexpectedly as mild weather cut
demand for heating fuels.  Gas slid 1 percent after the Energy Department said
inventories rose 2 billion cubic feet in the week ended Dec. 7
to 3.806 trillion cubic feet. Analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg showed an expected drop of 3 billion. It was the
latest seasonal supply gain since the week ended Dec. 30, 2005,
according to department data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The storage injection was reflective of the very, very
warm temperatures,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of research with
IAF Advisors in Houston. “If Mother Nature continues to deal
bearish blows, the market is going to head lower.”  Natural gas for January delivery decreased 3.5 cents to
$3.347 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement price since Sept. 28.
The futures have risen 12 percent this year, heading for the
first annual gain since 2007.  January $3.70 calls were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They were 0.5 cent lower at 1.2 cents on
volume of 2,629 contracts as of 3:15 p.m. Calls accounted for 49
percent of options volume.  The stockpile increase compares with the five-year average
decline for the week of 113 billion cubic feet, department data
show. Supplies were 8 percent above the five-year average, wider
than 4.6 percent the previous week. Inventories were 1.3 percent
higher than year-earlier levels after being 0.9 percent lower in
last week’s report.  Stockpile Surplus  Today’s data release “has minor bearish implications for
the reports to follow and we see another two reports with below-
average withdrawals before colder temperatures in late December
begin guiding prices back to the upside,”  Tim Evans , an energy
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York, said in a note
to clients.  Temperatures may be normal or above normal in the eastern
U.S. next week, according to MDA Weather Services.  The low in New York on Dec. 18 may be 36 degrees Fahrenheit
(2 Celsius), 5 more than the usual reading, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  The low in
 Chicago  may be 29 degrees, 7 above normal. About 50 percent of
U.S. households use gas for heating.  This year will probably overtake 1998 to become the warmest
year on record in the U.S., the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration  said in a monthly climate report.  The first 11 months were the warmest start to any year in
the contiguous states since the nation began keeping records in
1895, NOAA’s  Climatic Data Center  said Dec. 6.  The U.S. raised its forecast for natural gas output in 2012
by 0.6 percent in a Dec. 11 report.  Gas Production  Marketed gas production will average a record 69.22 billion
cubic feet a day this year, up from 68.84 billion estimated in
November, the department said in its monthly  Short-Term Energy
Outlook . Output may rise 0.5 percent in 2013 to 69.59 billion a
day, department estimates show.  Gas prices  at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana ,
will average $2.78 per million British thermal units, compared
with the previous estimate of $2.77, according to the report
from the department’s Energy Information Administration.  The boom in oil and natural gas production from shale
formations helped the U.S. cut its reliance on imported fuel.
America met 83 percent of its energy needs in the first eight
months of the year, department data show. If the trend goes on
through 2012, it will be the highest level of self-sufficiency
since 1991.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
440,721 as of 2:44 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 360,000. Volume was 467,610 yesterday. Open interest was 1.15
million contracts. The three-month average is 1.16 million.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting full
volume and open interest data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
