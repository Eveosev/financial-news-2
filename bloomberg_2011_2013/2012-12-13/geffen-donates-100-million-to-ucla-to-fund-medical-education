David Geffen , the billionaire
entertainment executive, will donate $100 million to the
University of California,  Los Angeles , to help medical students
graduate without debt.  The David Geffen Medical Scholarship Fund will cover four
years of tuition, fees and living expenses for as many as 33
students a year, or 20 percent of the class, UCLA said in a
 statement  on its website yesterday. The cost of medical school
can exceed $300,000 for four years, and average debt for U.S.
medical graduates was $170,000 in 2012, UCLA said.  Geffen, 69, is a founder of Asylum Records and  DreamWorks
SKG (DWA)  Studios. He donated $200 million in 2002 to UCLA’s medical
school, which was renamed in his honor. With more than $300
million pledged, Geffen is the largest individual benefactor of
UCLA or any single  University of California  campus, according to
the statement.  “The cost of a world-class medical education should not
deter our future innovators, doctors and scientists from the
path they hope to pursue,” Geffen said in the statement. “We
need the students at this world-class institution to be driven
by determination and the desire to do their best work and not by
the fear of crushing debt.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
