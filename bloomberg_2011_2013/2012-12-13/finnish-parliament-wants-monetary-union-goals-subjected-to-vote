Finland’s parliament called on the
government of Prime Minister  Jyrki Katainen  to bring proposals
for the future of the monetary union to a lawmaker vote.  The government should present a report on the European
Monetary Union’s long-term development targets to the
parliament, allowing lawmakers to pass or reject the proposals,
the parliament’s Grand Committee said today in an e-mailed
statement. Katainen’s six-party coalition has the backing of 124
lawmakers of the assembly’s 200.  “Developing the EMU isn’t just a question of economic
policy,” Miapetra Kumpula-Natri, who chairs the committee, said
in the statement. “Economic policy must have a democratic
mandate.”  Finland, one of the four AAA rated euro nations, opposes
joint borrowing by the 17 member states and has called for
fiscal discipline as the euro area endures a fourth year of
crisis. The deal by European Union finance ministers on banking
supervision is a “decisive step” toward breaking the link
between banks and governments, Katainen said.  “I will push for all reforms that build a strong EMU based
on the original no-bail out idea,” Katainen said in a separate
statement. “Steps that lead to a transfer union with joint
liabilities would make the EMU weaker, not stronger.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
