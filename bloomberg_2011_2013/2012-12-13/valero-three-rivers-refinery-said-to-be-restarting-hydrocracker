Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  is restarting a
hydrocracker at the refinery in Three Rivers,  Texas , after it
tripped offline yesterday, according to a person familiar with
the matter.  The unit, which converts heavy hydrocarbons into lighter,
more valuable fuels such as diesel and gasoline, halted after an
instrumentation problem, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the information isn’t public.  The refinery reported a unit upset at 6:14 a.m. yesterday.
Bill Day, a San Antonio-based spokesman for Valero, said the
report was related to an “issue with the hydrocracker.”  The Three Rivers plant can run as much as 100,000 barrels
of crude a day. It gets the majority of that from the nearby
Eagle Ford shale formation, the company has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
