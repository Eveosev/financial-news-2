China’s stocks  fell, driving the
benchmark index down the most in more than a week, as waning
investor interest in equities drove brokerages down and lower
metal prices dragged on materials producers.  GF Securities Co. and  Huatai Securities Co. (601688)  sank at least 2
percent. Zhongjin Gold Corp. paced losses by gold producers
after the price of the precious metal slid below $1,700 an
ounce. Bank of America Corp.’s China strategist said China’s
stocks will face another difficult year in 2013 because of
concern about the sustainability of economic growth.  “Some investors are doubtful about the magnitude of the
economic recovery,” said Wei Wei, an analyst at West China
Securities Co. in Shanghai. “That’s why you see some investors
pulling money out of the market to lock in profits.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  declined 1 percent to 2,061.48
at the close, the biggest retreat since Dec. 3. The  CSI 300

to 10.8 this month, the lowest level since at least 1997,  data 
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Stock Discount  The Shanghai index may trade at 1,923 at the end of next

quarters including an unstable financial market and an over-
reliance on both property purchases and local  government
investment , David Cui, chief China strategist at Bank of
America, wrote in a report dated Dec. 10. The target represents

level since the week to Nov. 26, 2010, according to regulatory
