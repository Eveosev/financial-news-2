Polish airline LOT dismissed Chief
Executive Officer Marcin Pirog, citing the performance of the
state-owned company under his leadership.  Pirog will be replaced on an interim basis by Chief
Financial Officer Zbigniew Mazur, Warsaw-based LOT, as Polskie
Linie Lotnicze Lot SA is known, said in an e-mailed statement.  The airline’s supervisory board, which decided to fire
Pirog at a meeting today, is still confident an existing
turnaround plan will lead to “profitability in a very short
time and will bring stabilization,” the company said.  LOT lost a potential buyer in June when  Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO) 
AO, or Turkish Airlines, ended talks because of European Union
rules capping outside ownership.  With Poland poised to enter recession for the first time
since communism fell, LOT is now seeking to sell stakes in a
domestic arm together with catering, casino and fuel operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
