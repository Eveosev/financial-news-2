Devin Harris scored from 12 feet
with four seconds left, then added a point from the foul line to
lead the  Utah  Jazz to a 99-98 win over the  Miami Heat , who had a
nine-game National Basketball Association winning streak broken.  Harris had 13 points for the Jazz, who improved to 17-18 at

the buzzer.  Al Jefferson led the Jazz with 20 points and C.J. Miles had
14 points.  LeBron James had a game-high 35 points and 10 rebounds and
