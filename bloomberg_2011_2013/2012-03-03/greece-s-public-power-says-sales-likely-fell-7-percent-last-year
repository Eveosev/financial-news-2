Public Power Corp. SA (PPC) ,  Greece ’s
largest electricity producer, said revenue from power sales
likely fell about 7 percent last year.  The company said it sees a earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization margin of around 14 percent, lower
than the figure for the nine-month period. That was mainly due
to a higher energy mix cost after the Athens-based company saw
“significantly lower” hydro generation, according to a
Regulatory News Statement late yesterday.  The company’s earnings may be hurt further from a potential
increase in provisions for payments due by third-party
suppliers, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
