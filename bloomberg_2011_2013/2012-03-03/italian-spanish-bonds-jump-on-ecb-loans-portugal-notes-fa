Italy’s 10-year bonds rose for an
eighth week, the longest run of gains in 14 years, after demand
for the securities surged as the  European Central Bank  provided
financial institutions with a second round of three-year loans.  Spanish 10-year (GSPG10YR)  and two-year securities advanced for a
third consecutive week after the Frankfurt-based central bank
lent 800 financial institutions a greater-than-forecast 529.5
billion euros ($699 billion) through its longer-term refinancing
operation, or LTRO. Portuguese  two-year notes  fell for the first
time in five weeks even after the ECB was said to buy the
nation’s securities. German bunds rose for a second week.  “The market thinks the LTRO is helping to ease the euro-
crisis and this is contributing to a general mood of greater
risk appetite,” said Allan von Mehren, chief analyst at  Danske
Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen.  Italy ’s  10-year (GBTPGR10)  yield fell 57 basis points, or 0.57
percentage point, this week to 4.91 percent at 4:50 p.m. in
London yesterday. The 5 percent bond due March 2022 rose 4.285,
or 42.85 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.150.  The Italian 10-year rate has declined more than 2
percentage points over the past eight weeks, in the longest
streak of declines since November 1998. It touched 4.90 percent
on March 1, the lowest since Aug. 18.  Spain ’s 10-year bond yield rose above Italy’s for the first
time since August 2011. The Iberian nation’s benchmark yields
dropped 15 basis points this week, while its two-year note
yields fell 36 basis points to 2.25 percent.  Italian Notes  Italy’s  two-year note yields  have tumbled more than 4
percentage points to 1.75 percent since the ECB announced its
plan to offer unlimited loans for three years on Dec. 8. Banks
took 489 billion euros in the first operation later that month.  Portugal ’s two-year note yields fell to a seven-week low
yesterday after the ECB purchased the nation’s short-dated
securities, according to four people with knowledge of the
transactions who declined to be identified because the trades
are confidential.  Two-year Portuguese rates rose 19 basis points to 13.11
percent. Longer-dated Portuguese debt slid, with the price of
10-year bonds falling to less than 50 percent of face value for
the first time in almost a month. German 10-year bund yields
declined eight basis points over the week to 1.80 percent.  Germany  is scheduled to sell 4 billion euros of 0.75
percent securities maturing in 2017. The results of the auction
will be published on March 7 at 10:30 a.m.  London  time.  France 
and the Netherlands will sell bills on March 5 and  Austria  plans
to auction 1.1 billion euros of 2022 bonds on March 6.  Italian bonds have handed investors a return of 13 percent
this year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
bonds gained 3 percent, Portugal’s bonds have returned 2 percent
and German bunds are little changed, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
