German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
wants to create an independent tester to evaluate the quality of
financial products for consumers, the  Bild Zeitung  reported
without saying where it got the information.  The Berlin-based “ Stiftung Warentest ”, a self-financing
tester of consumer products, may serve as a model for such a
service, the newspaper reported today. Coalition leaders will
discuss the proposal at a regular meeting in the chancellory in
Berlin on March 4, Bild said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
