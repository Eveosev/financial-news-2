Thousands of demonstrators took to
the streets in  Hong Kong  today, calling for universal suffrage
and criticizing  Donald Tsang , the city’s chief executive, for
allegedly accepted perks from local tycoons.  The protesters, mostly dressed in black, chanted “Down
with Donald Tsang” and “End the Small-Circle Election” as
they marched to the Central Government offices from  Victoria
Park , passing through Hong Kong’s Central business and financial
district.  “I feel so helpless in being a Hong Kong citizen, as we
don’t have any say in our chief executive election,” said Karen
Yuen, 20, a second-year university student who took part in the
march with colleagues. Only 1,200 members of the election
committee will get the right to vote in the March 25 election in
Hong Kong.  Eric Lai, an organizer with Hong Kong’s Civil Human Rights
Front, estimated that about 5,300 protesters marched in the
protest, while police said about 2,800 people participated, Hong
Kong’s Cable TV reported.  Public anger also has been fueled by reports Tsang accepted
perks including overseas trips on luxury yachts and private jets
from local business people. The official apologized in the
Legislative Council on March 1 after the city’s anti-corruption
bureau began investigating his overseas trips, four months
before he retires.  The investigation marks the first-ever probe into the
city’s top leader.  To contact the reporter on this story:
