Two passenger trains collided in
southern  Poland  today, killing “several” people and injuring
about 60 more, Transport Ministry Slawomir Nowak said.  “There are several deaths and many injured,” Nowak told
television TVN24.  Malgorzata Wozniak, a spokeswoman for the Interior
Ministry, told TVN24 about 60 people had been injured and more
than 200 emergency workers were at the scene of the collision,
about 250 kilometers (155 miles) south of Warsaw.  The trains collided near the town of Szczekociny on a busy
train route between Warsaw and Krakow, Lukasz Kurpinski, a
