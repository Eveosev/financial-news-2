KA Finanz AG, the “bad bank” of
nationalized Austrian lender Kommunalkredit Austria AG, may get
an injection of 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) of government
funds should credit default swaps kick in because of a Greek
default, according to Finance Minister Maria Fekter.  Should Greece be considered in default, CDS would be
triggered and KA Finanz would need about 1 billion euros, Fekter
said in an  interview  in Austrian state radio ORF today, adding
that the government has made “provisions for 600 million euros,
the remaining 400 million euros are to be seen as a risk.”  Kommunalkredit, then owned by  Oesterreichische Volksbanken
AG (VBPS)  and Dexia SA, was nationalized in October 2008 to avoid a
collapse when liquidity dried up. It was split into
Kommunalkredit, which continued as municipal lender, and KA
Finanz, a “bad bank” that took on securities, loans and credit
default swaps that are not part of that main business and is
winding down those assets. Austria plans to sell Kommunalkredit
by the middle of 2013, it said in November.  Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International AG, which also was
nationalized, may also require additional state funds should its
capital base fall under legal requirements as a consequence of a
failure to “offload” risky assets, Fekter said.  About 4 billion euros remain in  Austria ’s bank-bailout fund
and that will be enough, the finance minister said in the
interview.  Austria this week also agreed to partially nationalize
Volksbanken.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
