An Egyptian court threw out a
lawsuit filed by a number of citizens against Egyptian
billionaire  Naguib Sawiris  in relation to a cartoon he posted on
Twitter.  The court refused to hear the case because the man who
filed it had no standing in the matter, Judge Sherif Kamel said
today in Cairo. Another court dismissed the lawsuit on Feb. 28.  The case stems from an image that Sawiris posted on his
Twitter account of  Mickey Mouse  in a beard and Minnie Mouse in a
niqab, or full veil. Some Muslims said the cartoon insulted
their religion. Sawiris said he meant no disrespect and
apologized for posting it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
