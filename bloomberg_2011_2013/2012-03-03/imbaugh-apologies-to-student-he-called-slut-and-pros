Radio commentator Rush Limbaugh
apologized to Sandra Fluke, the law student he called a “slut”
and a “prostitute” after she advocated health insurance
coverage for contraception.  “My choice of words was not the best, and in the attempt
to be humorous, I created a national stir,” Limbaugh said in a
statement posted on his show’s website. “I sincerely apologize
to Ms. Fluke for the insulting word choices.”  Fluke, who is attending  Georgetown University ’s law school,
received a phone call offering support yesterday from President
 Barack Obama .  Fluke was barred from testifying last month before a House
committee on what became an all-male panel talking about women’s
access to  birth control . She appeared a week later before House
Democrats.  Limbaugh called Fluke a “slut” and a “prostitute” on
his March 1 show, according to a transcript posted on his show’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
