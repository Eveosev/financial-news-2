Roche Holding AG (ROG)  has “no material
risks” in  Greece  after selling off at a discount debts owed to
it in the country,  Tages-Anzeiger  reported, citing Chief
Executive Officer Severin Schwan.  Some of the drugmaker’s customers in Spain and  Italy  are
not paying their bills and Roche is trying to find solutions,
Schwan said in an interview in today’s newspaper. The overall
situation in the countries is under control, Schwan told Tages-
Anzeiger.  To contact the reporter on this story:
