Greece  will invite bids for the
Hellenic Horserace Betting Company, also known as  ODIE , in
several days,  To Vima  reported, without saying how it got the
information.  The  Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund , which is
charged with selling Greek government assets, initially
approached 40 companies to gauge interest in the company, the
Athens-based newspaper said in an article to be published in
tomorrow’s edition.  Four companies responded positively, including France’s
PMU, South Africa’s  Phumelela Gaming & Leisure Ltd (PHM)  and Greece’s
 Intralot SA (INLOT)  and Avenir SA, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
