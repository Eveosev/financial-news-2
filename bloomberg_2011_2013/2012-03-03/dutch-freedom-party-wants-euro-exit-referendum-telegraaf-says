The Dutch  Freedom party  wants voters
in the Netherlands to decide in a referendum whether the country
should return to the guilder,  De Telegraaf  reported today,
citing an interview with party leader  Geert Wilders .  Leaving the euro will cost money, especially the first
year, after which loss will be recovered in 2014, the newspaper
cited Wilders as saying. Wilders added that this at least
warrants a referendum,  De Telegraaf  reported.  The Freedom Party hired Lombard Street Research to
investigate the cost of maintaining the Euro zone and
alternative scenarios if countries elect to leave, according to
a statement by London-based FTI Consulting. The report will be
presented in  The Hague  on March 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
