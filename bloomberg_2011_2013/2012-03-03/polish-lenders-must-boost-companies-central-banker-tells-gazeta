Poland’s commercial banks should
increase loans to companies to stimulate the economy instead of
focusing on consumer and mortgage lending, Dobieslaw Tymoczka,
director of the central bank’s financial stability department,
told newspaper  Gazeta Wyborcza .  Polish banks lent companies 240 billion zloty ($77 billion)
as of the end of 2011, compared with 524 billion zloty in
credits to households, the lowest ratio of corporate loans to
total borrowing in  Europe , Tymoczka was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
