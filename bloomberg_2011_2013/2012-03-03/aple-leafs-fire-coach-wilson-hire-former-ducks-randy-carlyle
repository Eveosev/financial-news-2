The  Toronto Maple Leafs  fired head
coach Ron Wilson as the team falls out of National Hockey League
playoff contention, General Manager Brian Burke said.  Former Anaheim Mighty Ducks’ coach Randy Carlyle was hired
to take over the team, 29-28-7 with 65 points, five points below
the playoff cutoff in the Eastern Conference.  Wilson, 56, compiled a record of 130 wins, 135 losses and
45 overtime or shootout losses in 310 games since he was hired
by the Maple Leafs on June 10, 2008.  “This was not an easy decision for me to make,” Burke
said last night on the team’s website.  Burke hired Carlyle, 55, on Aug. 1, 2005, to coach the
Ducks. They went on to their first Stanley Cup championship in
2007 and five playoff appearances from 2005-09 and 2011.  Carlyle had the most wins and highest winning percentage in
Ducks’ history with a 273-182-61 record in 516 regular season
games. He was replaced by Bruce Boudreau in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
