Venezuela  President  Hugo Chavez  said
he’s recovering swiftly following an operation in Cuba to remove
a lesion from the same area where doctors extracted a cancerous
tumor in June.  Chavez, speaking publicly for a second consecutive day,
said he’s beginning to walk more and holding meetings with his
son-in-law, science minister Jorge Arreaza.  “Thanks to so much support, here I am taking flight once
again,” Chavez said in a telephone call from Havana broadcast
on Venezuelan state television. “I’ll be with you all of the
days, months and years that I have left in my life.”  In the first images since this week’s operation, sent by
Venezuela’s Information Minister Andres Izarra from his  Twitter 
account, Chavez sits in an office chair opposite former Cuban
President  Fidel Castro  in two photographs and is shown walking
in a hospital hallway in a third.  Wearing a blue and white track suit, Chavez is seen
listening to Castro speak, with portraits of Cuban and
Venezuelan heroes Jose Marti and  Simon Bolivar  and a Venezuelan
flag on the wall.  In the second photo of the hospital hallway, Chavez walks
alone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
