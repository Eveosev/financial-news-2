The  New Orleans Saints  designated
quarterback  Drew Brees  as their exclusive-rights franchise
player, guaranteeing he will be calling the plays in 2012,
General Manager Mickey Loomis said.  Brees will be prevented from negotiating with any other
National Football League team under the franchise tag rules.  Last season, the 33-year-old quarterback set the single-
season record for most passing yards with 5,476, surpassing Dan Marino’s record of 5,084 yards set in 1984. He led the NFL with
46 touchdown passes and an average of 342 passing yards per
game.  Under the exclusive rights tag formula, Brees will earn the
average of the top five quarterback salaries in 2012, a figure
that won’t be calculated until the free-agency period ends.  If the figure was calculated today, he would earn between
$16 million and $17 million.  Indianapolis Colts quarterback  Peyton Manning ’s next move
may impact that calculation. The 35-year-old player will learn
on March 8 if owner Robert Irsay will pay him a $28 million
bonus or let him become a free agent.  Manning missed last season after a neck surgery, and the
Colts have the opportunity to select Stanford University
quarterback Andrew Luck with the first pick in the pro-football
draft.  The Saints will meet the  Arizona Cardinals  to open the
NFL’s preseason in the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game on Aug. 5
in Canton,  Ohio .  To contact the reporter on this story:
