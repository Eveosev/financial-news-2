Taiwan’s government bonds gained,
with benchmark  10-year yields  dropping the most in more than two
weeks, on concern economic growth is stalling in European
countries. The local dollar advanced.  The island will sell NT$40 billion ($1.4 billion) of 10-
year debt at 1.283 percent today, according to the median
estimate of fixed-income traders in a Bloomberg News survey.  Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  announced yesterday a
new deficit target of 5.8 percent of gross domestic product,
compared with the 4.4 percent target previously agreed on with
the European Union. January retail sales in  Germany  declined 1.6
percent from December, the Federal Statistics Office said
yesterday. That fell short of a median 0.5 percent gain
predicted by economists.  “The banking industry and insurers should have decent
appetites for the bonds,” said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based fixed-
income trader at Polaris Securities Co. “Yields also came down
as there’s some concern on  Europe .”  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent bonds due March
2022 fell one basis point to 1.274 percent, prices from Gretai
Securities Market show. That’s the biggest decline for benchmark
10-year rates since Feb. 15.  The  Taiwan dollar  rose 0.1 percent to NT$29.429 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency
reached NT$29.30 on March 1, the strongest level since Sept. 9.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.4 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
