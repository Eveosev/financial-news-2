German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
needs a two-thirds majority in parliament to obtain approval of
the European Union agreement requiring balanced budgets,
 Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported.  The agreement, signed yesterday in Brussels by 25 of the
European Union’s 27 states, requires more than a simple
parliamentary majority because it shifts fiscal authority to the
EU level, the newspaper said, citing unidentified German
officials.  Germany ’s constitution requires a broad consensus for such
a step when it’s put up for a vote, the newspaper said. The
requirement means Merkel depends on the support of opposition
parties in both houses to ensure the accord is approved, SZ said  To contact the reporter on this story:
