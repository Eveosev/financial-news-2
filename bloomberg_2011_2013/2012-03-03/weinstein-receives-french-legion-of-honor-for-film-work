Harvey Weinstein , co-founder of
Weinstein Co., was named to France’s Legion of Honor for
producing and distributing movies that include “The Artist,”
winner of the 2012 Academy Award for best picture.  The 59-year-old executive will formally receive the honor,
with the rank of chevalier, in a ceremony in Paris next week,
Sarah Greenberg Roberts, spokeswoman for New York-based
Weinstein Co., said today in an interview.  Weinstein joins a number of U.S. filmmakers, including
 Steven Spielberg ,  Clint Eastwood  and Robert De Niro, who have
received the honor. In a letter announcing the award, French
President Nicolas Sarkozy cited Weinstein for his contributions
to the film industry and for introducing French movies to U.S.
audiences.  Weinstein’s  credits  include “Pulp Fiction,” “Gangs of
New York” and “Shakespeare in Love.” He has distributed more
than 30 French films in the U.S., including “Edith and Marcel”
and “Delicatessen,” according to a Weinstein Co. statement.  Weinstein and his brother Bob founded Weinstein Co. in 2005
after departing Miramax, a production company they started in
1979 and later sold to  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)   To contact the reporter on this story:
