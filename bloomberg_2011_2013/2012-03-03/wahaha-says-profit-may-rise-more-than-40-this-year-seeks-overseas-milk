Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co. , the
beverage maker owned by  China ’s second-richest man, is targeting
a more than 40 percent increase in profit this year as it
develops higher-margin products such as health drinks.  Chairman  Zong Qinghou , 66, who is also a member of the
Chinese legislature, said in an interview in Beijing today that
profit may rise to 10 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) from last
year’s 7 billion yuan as sales gain 24 percent to 85 billion
yuan.  “Compared with traditional beverages, health drinks offer
fatter margins,” said Zong, whose $10.7 billion of wealth
trails only the $11 billion of Sany Heavy Industry Co. Chairman
Liang Wengen, the Hurun Report estimates.  Wahaha (HWGZ) , which means “laughing children” in Chinese, sells
products from water and iced tea to children’s clothing and
plans to invest 4 billion yuan expanding beverage output
capacity in 2012 to reap profit in the next several years, said
Zong, a delegate to China’s  National People’s Congress  which
opens its annual session in Beijing on March 5.  Wahaha, which already sources its “Edison” baby formula
from the Netherlands, is also looking overseas for better
quality milk sources that China lacks, Zong said, adding he has
been examining dairy farms in the U.S.  Zong’s wealth shrank 12 percent last year from $12 billion
in 2010, Shanghai-based Hurun Research Institute said in
September. Liang, whose  Sany Heavy (631)  is China’s biggest machinery
maker by market value, was the country’s richest man in 2011
with an estimated $11 billion fortune, according to Hurun.  Forbes  Asia  dropped Zong to fifth place with a net worth of
$6.5 billion in its 2011 China rich list, from the top position
and $8 billion in 2010, Forbes said in September.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
