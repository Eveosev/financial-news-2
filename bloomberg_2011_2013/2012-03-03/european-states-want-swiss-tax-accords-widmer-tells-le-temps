Several European countries would
like to reach tax agreements with  Switzerland , Le Temps
reported, citing Swiss Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf.  While Switzerland is holding “technical” discussions with
representatives from those countries, it would prefer to wait
until accords with  Germany  and the U.K. take effect, Widmer-
Schlumpf said in an interview in today’s  newspaper .  She added that Switzerland hasn’t seen any indication that
the German government wants to renegotiate the agreement between
the two countries, Le Temps reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
