Irish European Affairs Minister
Lucinda Creighton said she’s “quite confident” that talks with
Ireland’s bailout partners to ease the burden of rescuing the
former Anglo Irish Bank Corp. will “bear fruit.”  Creighton was speaking on Dublin-based broadcaster RTE
today. The Irish government is negotiating with European
authorities to re-engineer about 30 billion euros in promissory
notes used by the state to bail out the bank, renamed the Irish
Bank Resolution Corp. last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
