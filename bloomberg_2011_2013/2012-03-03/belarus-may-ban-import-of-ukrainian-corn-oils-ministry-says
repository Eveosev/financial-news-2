Belarus may ban imports of Ukrainian
sunflower oil, corn and confectionary after the country imposed
controls over antibiotics in its food, Ukraine’s  Agriculture
Ministry  said.  Ukraine decided from March 1 to temporarily ban imports of
meat and dairy products from Belarus after cases of antibiotics
exceeding authorized limits were found in October and “became
massive” in February, Ivan Bisyuk, head of the state veterinary
and phytosanitary service, said in a statement e-mailed by the
ministry’s press service today.  Belarus officials said yesterday at a meeting in Kiev that
if import restrictions aren’t removed by Ukraine by 3 p.m. on
March 5, Belarus will ban shipments of Ukrainian sunflower oil,
corn, salt, confectionary and oilseed meal, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
