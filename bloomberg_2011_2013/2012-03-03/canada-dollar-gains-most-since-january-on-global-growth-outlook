Canada ’s dollar strengthened the
most since January versus its U.S. counterpart on speculation
accelerating global growth will boost the nation’s exports,
bolstering the case for interest-rate increases.  The Canadian currency was the best performer this week
against 14 of its 16 most-traded counterparts as the price of
crude oil, the country’s biggest export, touched the highest
level since 2008. Jobless-insurance claims fell and  consumer
confidence  rose in the U.S., the nation’s biggest trade partner.
Bank of Canada policy makers meet next week.  “Positive sentiment across global markets was the big
driver for the Canadian dollar,” said Blake Jespersen, director
of foreign exchange at Bank of Montreal in Toronto. “The
improving U.S. economy and rising oil prices are helping.”  The loonie, nicknamed for the image of the aquatic bird on
the C$1 coin, advanced 1 percent to 98.93 cents per  U.S. dollar 
yesterday in Toronto, from 99.93 cents on Feb. 24. It was the
biggest five-day gain since Jan. 27.  The currency touched 98.42 cents on March 1, the strongest
since September, before snapping a four-day winning streak
yesterday. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0108.  Longer-term government bonds rose, pushing the yield on the
benchmark  10-year note  down six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 1.96 percent. The yield reached 1.837 percent in
December, a record low.  Yields on Canada’s  two-year note  gained three basis points
to 1.11 percent. They touched 1.13 percent on March 1, the
highest level since Oct. 28.  Curve Flattens  The yield  difference  between two- and 10-year  government
bonds , plotted on the yield curve, narrowed to 86 basis points
yesterday, the least since September 2008, from 95 basis points
a week earlier. A flatter yield curve generally signals a
worsening economic outlook.  Canadian central bankers meet March 8 to determine  interest
rates . They have held their  benchmark  at 1 percent since
September 2010 as concern that some European countries may face
default tempers an annual inflation rate exceeding the central
bank’s 2 percent target for 14 straight months.  The loonie gained this week as data showed manufacturing
from  China  to the U.S. was expanding as the American recovery
strengthened and European leaders worked to contain the region’s
debt crisis. That spurred speculation demand for raw materials
will increase, with  Barclays Capital  predicting a third
consecutive annual shortage in global copper supplies in 2012.
Commodities beat stocks, bonds and the dollar last month for the
first time since July.  Commodity Currency  Canada derives about half its export revenue from raw
materials including crude oil, copper, gold, timber and wheat.
It’s the largest supplier of crude to the U.S., the world’s
biggest economy. Canada also is the world’s second-largest
producer of uranium after  Kazakhstan , the third-biggest producer
of natural gas and the third-largest exporter of wheat.  Brent crude  surged to $128.40 a barrel in  London  two days
ago, the highest price since July 2008, before ending the week
at $123.63. Copper futures gained for a second week, rising to
$3.9070 a pound in  New York .  “The rise in the price of crude oil is supportive for the
Canadian dollar,”  Lee Hardman , a foreign-exchange strategist at
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in London, said yesterday.
“We expect modest Canadian-dollar strength against the U.S.
dollar over the next one to three months.”  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index rose 0.3 percent in a third
weekly advance, after climbing on Feb. 29 to the highest level
in almost four years.  Euro Falls  The Canadian dollar advanced 2.9 percent against the euro
this week, the most since January 2011, to C$1.3056 as the
 European Central Bank  loaned 800 banks 529.5 billion euros
($712.2 billion) on Feb. 29 to bolster liquidity.  The loonie fell against the greenback yesterday for the
first time in five days after data showed Canada’s  gross
domestic product  slowed to a 1.8 percent annualized pace from
October to December, following a revised 4.2 percent third-
quarter rate. The fourth-quarter figure matched the median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Canada’s currency gained earlier in the week as U.S. Labor
Department data showed  applications  for  unemployment benefits 
fell to 351,000 in the week ended Feb. 25, a level matching the
lowest since March 2008. The Conference Board’s gauge of
confidence among American consumers climbed more than forecast
to a reading of 70.8, the highest level in a year.  Canadian employers  added a net 14,500 jobs last month,
economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast before the government
issues the data March 9. Payrolls grew by 2,300 in January.  Volatility Rises  Implied volatility for one-month options on Canada’s
dollar versus the greenback increased from the lowest level in
almost five years. It touched 7.63 percent on March 1 after
reaching 6.90 percent on Feb. 24, the least on an intraday basis
since June 2007. Implied volatility, which traders quote and use
to set option prices, signals the expected pace of swings in the
underlying currency. The five-year average is 12 percent.  The loonie weakened 1.7 percent over the past year,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, a
gauge of 10 developed-nation currencies. The U.S. dollar gained
0.5 percent, while the euro tumbled 4.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
