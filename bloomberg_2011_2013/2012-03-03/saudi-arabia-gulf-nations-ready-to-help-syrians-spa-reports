Saudi Arabia  and other Gulf
Cooperation Council members are ready to participate in any
joint effort to help Syrians protect themselves from the
government of President Bashar al-Assad,  Saudi Press Agency 
reported.  The Syrian government “lost its legitimacy once it killed
its citizens,” the news service cited Abdullah bin Yahya al-
Mua’lemi, the kingdom’s ambassador to the  United Nations , as
saying. Saudi Arabia urged the UN Security Council to use all
means “to halt Syrian killing machines,” SPA said.  Fighting in the Syrian city of Homs has intensified
international pressure on Assad a year after his security forces
began a crackdown on protests. The opposition is increasingly
taking up arms, pushing the country into civil war. The UN has
estimated that more than 7,500 people have died.  To contact the reporter on this story:
