Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
“unemotional and level-headed” approach in tackling the debt
crisis is an asset,  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  Chief Executive  Martin Winterkorn  told the  Welt am Sonntag  newspaper.  Foreign observers “fully admire” the role played by
 Germany  in diffusing the crisis while they are also concerned
about the country showing at times a “tendency toward
megalomania,” Winterkorn is cited as saying in the interview
that’s scheduled to be published tomorrow.  Most countries want to learn from German labor-market
policy, including “how we have managed to make our cars built
by such well-trained people,” Winterkorn said, according to an
advanced copy of the article.  Winterkorn said that developments in  Greece  remain a source
of concern. Doubts whether the country can fulfill conditions
set for a financial bailout and whether it can get its economy
on its feet “are growing,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
