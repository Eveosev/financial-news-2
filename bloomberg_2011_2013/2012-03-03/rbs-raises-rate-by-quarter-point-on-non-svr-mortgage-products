Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc 
raised the interest rate on two mortgage products by 0.25
percentage point, the lender said in an emailed statement.  The products, namely Offset and The One Account, are not
standard variable rate mortgages, according to the statement,
which was issued in response to media reports that the bank was
increasing its SVR mortgage rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
