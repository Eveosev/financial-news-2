Sudanese President Ummar al-Bashir
ordered state governors to train recruits for a “deterrence
force” to fight rebels in the oil-rich state of Southern
Kordofan, state-run SMC news center reported today.  Each state will form one brigade, with seven coming from
the capital of Khartoum, the news service reported, citing al-
Bashir.  “We’re ready for martyrdom in a war with rebels from Sudan
People Liberation Movement,” al-Bashir was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
