The decision by European leaders in
December to reverse their doctrine on private sector involvement
in shouldering potential bond losses has reduced credit risk,
 Central Bank of Cyprus  governor Athanasios Orphanides said.  “The change in the PSI approach is one important reason
that we at last have a reversal and some improvement following
the December summit in how markets view us,” Orphanides, who is
also member of the  European Central Bank ’s governing council,
said in Nicosia today. “We have a considerable improvement, if
you compare with our situation in November and where we are now
with respect of risk.”  “We have not solved the problem yet because the risk is
still higher compared to what we had two years ago,” he said.  He added that the reason for the higher risk, reflected in
higher borrowing costs in the euro area, is that European
leaders only partially reversed their “catastrophic” Oct. 26
decision as it exempted a 50 percent haircut on Greek debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
