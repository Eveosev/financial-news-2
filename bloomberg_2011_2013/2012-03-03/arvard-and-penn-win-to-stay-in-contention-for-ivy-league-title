New York  Knicks point guard Jeremy Lin watched his alma mater  Harvard University  move one step
closer to its first men’s National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament appearance.  Lin was on hand last night to see  Kyle Casey  score 19
points for the Crimson, who beat  Columbia University  77-70 in
overtime at Francis S. Levien Gymnasium in New York.  Lin, 23, a Harvard economics graduate, was undrafted and
cut by two National Basketball Association teams before he came
off the Knicks’ bench on Feb. 4 to spark a 10-3 record. The 6-
foot-3 Lin played four years at Cambridge, Massachusetts-based
Harvard and was a unanimous first-team all Ivy League selection
in 2010 as a senior.  The Crimson (25-4), the preseason Ivy League favorite,
improved their conference record to 11-2 with one regular-season
game remaining today at Cornell. The  University of Pennsylvania 
also won and could force a playoff for the NCAA spot.  There have been eight tiebreakers in the history of the Ivy
League, the only conference in basketball’s top division without
a season-ending tournament. Penn has won at least a share of the
league title 25 times since 1957, second to Princeton’s 26,
while Harvard’s co-title last year was its first.  Outscored  Harvard, which led 34-30 at halftime, was outscored 32-28
in the second half as Columbia’s Mark Cisco tied the game at 62-
62 with two layups. Oliver McNally missed a 3-pointer with two
seconds left in regulation.  Brian Barbour led Columbia (14-15, 3-10 Ivy) with 23 points.  Penn (18-11) defeated  Brown University  (8-22) 54-43 to push
its Ivy League record to 10-2 with games remaining today at home
against  Yale University  and on March 6 at  Princeton University .  Zach Rosen had 19 points for the Quakers at the Palestra in
Philadelphia. Jean Harris led the Bears with 16.  If Harvard and Penn both finish with 12-2 records, they
would have a one-game playoff to determine the conference’s
automatic qualifier for the NCAA tournament.  Harvard lost in the final second of a one-game playoff with
Princeton last season after the two schools tied for the
regular-season conference title.  In other Ivy League games, it was Princeton 64, Yale 57 and
Cornell 70, Dartmouth 57.  To contact the reporter on this story:
