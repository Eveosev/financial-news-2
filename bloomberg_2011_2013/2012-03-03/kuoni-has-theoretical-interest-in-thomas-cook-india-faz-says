Swiss travel company  Kuoni Reisen
Holding AG (KUNN)  has a “theoretical” interest in buying parts of
 Thomas Cook Group Plc. (TCG) ’s Indian business while ruling out any
move to buy a European operation from the company,  Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung  reported.  Kuoni wants to expand its Asia business to account for 50
percent of its total sales in coming years from 42 percent now,
the newspaper said, citing Kuoni Chief Executive Officer Peter Rothwell. Kuoni sees no possibility of buying Thomas Cook assets
in Germany, Scandinavia or the U.K. as they would offer too
little synergy or raise antitrust problems.  The Swiss company may seek to reduce business in Italy and
Spain while at the moment this is “not an option.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
