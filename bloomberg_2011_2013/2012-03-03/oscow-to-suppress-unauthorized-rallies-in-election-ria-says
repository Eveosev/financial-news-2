Moscow police will not tolerate any
“provocation” as Russians vote in presidential elections
tomorrow, and will suppress any unauthorized rallies, RIA
Novosti reported, citing police chief Vladimir Kolokoltsev.  Internet social networks show that some activists may
provoke people at polling stations by claiming the ballot count
is unfair, Kolokoltsev said, state-run RIA reported. About 6,500
policemen from other regions arrived to Moscow to help maintain
security in the Russian capital, the newswire said.  About 600,000 Russian citizens have registered on the
government-sponsored Internet site to watch webcasts from
polling stations to ascertain that the ballots are submitted and
counted fairly, RIA Novosti said, citing the country’s
Telecommunications Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
