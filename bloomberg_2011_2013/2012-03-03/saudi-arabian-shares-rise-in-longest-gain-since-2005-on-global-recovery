Saudi Arabian shares rose for an
11th day, the longest winning streak since August 2005, after
global stocks advanced as manufacturing and jobs data in  China 
and the U.S. boosted the world’s economic outlook.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  rose 0.9 percent to 7,336.21,
its highest level since Sept. 28, 2008. The 152-member index’s
rally is the longest since a 14-day surge that ended on Aug. 8,
2005.  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , Saudi Arabia’s largest publicly traded
lender by assets, jumped the most in more than seven weeks.
 Alinma Bank (ALINMA) , an Islamic lender, reached its highest price in 23
months.  “The market is rallying as telecom and cement shares are
gaining,” said Turki Fadaak, head of research at Riyadh-based
Albilad Investment Co. “The index is moving positively, boosted
by gains in global markets, although Tadawul has not yet reached
levels prior to the 2008 financial crisis.”  U.S. stocks  rose this week, with the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index completing its best February since 1998. The  MSCI Asia
Pacific Index (MXAP)  climbed 0.2 percent, capping an 11-week advance,
the longest such streak since its inception in 1988.  U.S. jobless claims fell to equal a four-year low in the
week ended Feb. 25 and the economy expanded faster than analysts
expected in the fourth quarter, data released this week showed.
Chinese manufacturing expanded for a third month in February, a
signal the world’s largest exporter is weathering the threat of
a global slowdown.  Highest Close  Al Rajhi  added 2.2 percent, the biggest increase since Jan.
10, to 80.75 riyals, while Alinma climbed 4.9 percent to 12.90
riyals, the highest close since April 3, 2010.  Saudi Cement Co. (SACCO) ,
the kingdom’s second-biggest cement company by market value,
strengthened 2.3 percent to 91 riyals, the highest price since
April 10, 2006.  Abdullah A.M. Al-Khodari Sons Co. (ALKHODAR) , a contracting company,
advanced 2.8 percent, the largest increase in a week, to 55.25
riyals. The Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia-based company plans to issue
one bonus share for every four held to raise its capital to
531.25 million riyals ($142 million) from 425 million riyals.
The company’s board also recommended paying a dividend of 0.5
riyals a share for the second half.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
that opens on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
