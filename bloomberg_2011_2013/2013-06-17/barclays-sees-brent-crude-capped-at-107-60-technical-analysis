Brent crude’s two-week rally may
halt at about $107.60 a barrel as futures reach the top of an
upward-sloping trading channel, according to  technical analysis 
by Barclays Plc.  Brent’s August contract traded above the 200-day moving
average on June 14 before it capped a two-week, 2.3 percent
advance to $105.93 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.
It also settled above a previous resistance level of $105.15,
signaling further gains are possible within a new range, the
bank said in an e-mailed report.  “The range break in Brent signals further upside toward
the $107.40 to $107.60 range where we would look for signs of a
top,” said Jordan Kotick, the global head of technical strategy
at Barclays in  New York .  Brent for August delivery slid 23 cents, or 0.2 percent, to
$105.70 a barrel at 12:35 p.m. in  Singapore  today. Front-month
futures are up 4.9 percent this year. The contract is below its
200-day moving average, at $106.33 today.  “Overall bias is still lower within context of the larger
range,” according to Kotick, who identified resistance on the
weekly chart at $104.76 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
