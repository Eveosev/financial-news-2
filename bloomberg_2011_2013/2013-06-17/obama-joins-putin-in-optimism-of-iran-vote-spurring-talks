U.S. President  Barack Obama  and
Russian President  Vladimir Putin  expressed optimism that the
election in Iran may open a new avenue for ending the standoff
over the Islamic republic’s nuclear program.  Obama said he and Putin share “cautious optimism” that
the election of Hassan Rohani as president in Iran will
jumpstart talks on Iran’s nuclear development efforts.  “With election in Iran we hope there are new
opportunities” to resolve the tensions in the region, Putin
said through a translator as he and Obama concluded a meeting in
Enniskillen,  Northern Ireland , where they are attending a summit
of leaders from the Group of Eight nations.  Rohani, who won a first-round victory in this weekend’s
voting, said today he will pursue a policy of moderation to
improve Iran’s relations with neighboring countries and beyond.
He takes office in August.  Israel and the U.S. contend Iran is trying to develop
nuclear weapons capability. Both have threatened to attack Iran
should other means fail to stop the Islamic republic from trying
to obtain nuclear weapons. Iranian officials say the nuclear
program is for energy and medical research.  To contact the reporters on this story:
