EP Energy LLC, the production and
exploration unit formed when  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  bought
El Paso Corp.’s oil and gas operations last year, agreed to sell
$1.3 billion of assets in three deals.  Atlas Resource Partners LP (ARP)  will buy EP’s coal-bed methane
properties in the Raton, Black Warrior and Arkoma basins,

LLC will take over gas fields in  Texas  and  Louisiana , and a
third company that wasn’t identified will purchase other assets
in Texas.  The assets had a combined daily average production of 215
million cubic feet in the first quarter and generated earnings
of $40 million before interest, taxes, depreciation,
amortization and exploration expenses, according to the
statement.  Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR)  served as adviser for the sales to
Atlas and WildHorse and Royal Bank of Canada was adviser for the
third sale. The legal adviser was Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld
