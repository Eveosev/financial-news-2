Rubber climbed for a second day as
Japan’s currency weakened against the dollar, raising the appeal
of yen-denominated futures, and as a rally in oil stoked
speculation prices of synthetic products will increase.  The contract for delivery in November gained as much as 2.6
percent to 241.3 yen a kilogram ($2,547 a metric ton) on the
 Tokyo  Commodity Exchange. Futures traded at 239.2 yen at 10:43
a.m., paring this year’s drop to 21 percent.  The yen fell to 94.78 a dollar after rallying the most
since July 2009 last week. The  Federal Open Market Committee 
meets this week. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said May 22 U.S.
policy makers could curb stimulus should the job market improve.  “The weaker yen gave support to rubber futures,” Takaki
Shigemoto, an analyst at research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo,
said by phone today. “A rally in oil also spurred investors to
buy back futures as tensions in the  Middle East  increased.”  West Texas Intermediate crude advanced 1.9 percent last
week after President  Barack Obama  was said to authorize arming
Syrian rebels groups, ratcheting up tensions in a region home to
about a third of the world’s oil supply.  Thai rubber free-on-board dropped 0.9 percent to 85.75 baht
($2.81) a kilogram on June 14, the lowest level since May 2,
according to the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand.  Thailand, the world’s largest producer and exporter, plans
to set up a fund to trade rubber on the Agricultural Futures
Exchange of Thailand, or AFET, to help reduce price volatility,
according to the nation’s farm ministry.  Rubber for delivery in September on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange added 1.8 percent to 18,290  yuan  ($2,982) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
