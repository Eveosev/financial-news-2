A four-member Al Jazeera Television
reporting team was detained three days ago in  Niger ’s southern
town of Zinder, Al Jazeera Media Network said.  The team, including correspondent Yvonne Ndege, camera
operator Romuald Luyindula, producer Mohammed Abubakar and
driver Rabiu Abdullahi, has been held “in harsh conditions
without any further information regarding their release,” the
Doha, Qatar-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.
It called on the Niger government to release them.  Niger has seen an upsurge of violence by Islamist groups
targeting government institutions and Western interests in the
past year. Bomb attacks on May 23 at a military base and an
uranium mine run by French company  Areva SA (AREVA)  left at least 23
people dead.  Nigeria, its southern neighbor, is fighting an insurgency
by Boko Haram Islamists who want shariah rule. More than 8,000
people have fled Nigeria’s northeast to neighboring countries,
most to landlocked Niger, after troops began an offensive
against the Islamist insurgents last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
