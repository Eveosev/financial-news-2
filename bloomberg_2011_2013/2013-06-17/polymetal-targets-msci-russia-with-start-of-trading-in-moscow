Polymetal International Plc (POLY) , the
Russian gold producer that’s being ejected from the FTSE 100
benchmark index this month, plans to start trading its shares in
Moscow to broaden its investor base.  Trading of the shares in Moscow is expected to start June
20, Polymetal said today in a statement on its website. As part
of the move, one of its minority shareholders will sell as many
as 2 million shares valued at about $20 million that will be
traded in the Russian capital, Chief Executive Officer Vitaly Nesis said in a phone interview.  Polymetal moved its share listing from Moscow almost two
years ago in an attempt to tap new investors. Its shares have
slumped about 20 percent since the company gained a primary
listing on the  London Stock Exchange (LSE)  in October 2011.  The Moscow listing is an effort to gain possible inclusion
in the MSCI Russia benchmark, Nesis said, as well as allow the
company to shore up its investor base.  Pension funds will be able to invest in the company’s
stock, and the stock will also be eligible for inclusion in the
Russian central bank’s Lombard list, which means investors
qualify for financing from state banks using the stock, Nesis
said.  Polymetal shares will continue to trade in the FTSE 250
Index. “We are optimistic and hope to get back to FTSE 100 one
day,” Nesis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
