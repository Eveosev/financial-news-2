Solar-energy developers in the U.K.
are installing bigger power plants after the cost of panels
dropped quicker than the government reduced subsidies, the
British Photovoltaic Association said.  More than half of projects in development are sized 5
megawatts or bigger, up from about a third in the first quarter,
when installations reached 520 megawatts, Reza Shaybani, the
head of the British Photovoltaic Association, said today in an
interview at a conference in Munich.  Investors can generate returns of “between 8 percent to 12
percent, depending on what you install,” he said. The plunge in
prices for solar systems eclipsed the feed-in-tariff cuts of
about 50 percent, he said in a speech at the gathering.  Britain seeks to install as much as 22 gigawatts of solar
energy by 2020 as part of a target to get 15 percent of its
energy from renewables by the same year. While the U.K. is
“well on track” to achieve its 2020 solar target, the BPVA is
asking the government to suspend further cuts to the feed-in-tariff and the Renewables Obligations Certificate for 12 months
because of the European Union’s anti-dumping tariffs on  China 
that are hurting sales, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
