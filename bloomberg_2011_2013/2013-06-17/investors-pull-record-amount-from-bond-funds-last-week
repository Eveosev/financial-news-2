Investors pulled the most ever money
from bond funds worldwide, the second straight week of record
redemptions, after speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve may
scale back its unprecedented stimulus sent fixed-income markets
lower.  Bond funds lost $14.5 billion in the week ended June 12,
according to EPFR Global, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based firm
that tracks the flow of money into funds around the world.
Institutional and retail investors withdrew $12.5 billion during
the prior week, EPFR reported today in an e-mailed statement.  The investor withdrawals last week were from a range of
funds, including those that buy emerging-market bonds, U.S.
high-yield debt, intermediate-term bonds and municipal debt,
according to EPFR.  Investors have been dumping bonds since Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  told Congress on May 22 that the central bank’s policy-setting board could start scaling back its bond purchases in its
“next few meetings,” if the U.S. employment outlook shows
sustained improvement. Global bond markets had their biggest
monthly losses in nine years in May.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:  Charles
