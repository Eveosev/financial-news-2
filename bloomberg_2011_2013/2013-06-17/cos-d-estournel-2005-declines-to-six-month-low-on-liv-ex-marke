Four cases of Chateau Cos
d’Estournel 2005, a second-growth Saint-Estephe wine estate,
sold for 1,325 pounds ($2,070) each on the Liv-ex market in the
past week, a six-month low and 7 percent below the 2013 high.  The vintage fetched as much as 1,730 pounds a case on
London-based Liv-ex in 2011 as demand for Bordeaux wines peaked
and dropped as low as 1,300 pounds in November after appetite
cooled. It traded at 1,420 pounds as recently as April 25.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen almost 6 percent
this year, with an 8 percent gain in the 10 weeks to mid-March,
pared by a 2 percent decline since then. While investor demand
for top wines has revived since a 16-month price slide ended in
November, price cuts on Bordeaux 2012 futures over the past two
months have weighed on prices of other vintages from the region.  The 2005 vintage is the third most-expensive Cos d’Estournel
of the past eight years, lagging only the 2009 and 2010 wines,
according to merchant data collated by London-based Liv-ex on
its Cellar Watch website. The trades at 1,325 pounds took place
on June 11 and June 12, Liv-ex data showed.  Editors: Heather Langan, Peter Torday  To contact the reporter on this story:
