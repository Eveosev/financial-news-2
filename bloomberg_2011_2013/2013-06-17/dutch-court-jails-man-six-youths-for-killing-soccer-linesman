A 50-year-old Dutchman and six
youths were jailed for manslaughter after they kicked and beat a
soccer linesman to death during a match outside Amsterdam.  The man got a six-year sentence and the teenagers were sent
to youth detention for up to 24 months, the Lelystad court said
in a statement on its website. The linesman, Richard
Nieuwenhuizen, died a day after the Dec. 2 assault.  The adult defendant, the father of one of the youths,
wasn’t identified by the court.  Instead of intervening to stop the boys, “the father
joined in the kicking and beating and in no way whatsoever took
his responsibility,” the court said.  Nieuwenhuizen was a member of the Buitenboys B1 club, based
in Almere, 13 miles (21 kilometers) north of Amsterdam. The
incident happened when his team played against Nieuw-Sloten, a
club from Amsterdam. Nieuwenhuizen was acting as linesman in the
match where one of his sons was playing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
