Hedge funds and other money managers
cut  bullish bets  on  Brent crude  from a three-month high, the
first reduction in seven weeks, according to data from ICE
Futures  Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 160,033 lots in
the week ended June 11, the London-based exchange said today in
its weekly Commitments of Traders report. The reduction of 4,871
contracts is the first since April 23.  Bearish positions by  producers , merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 363,879 lots,
falling 4 percent from the previous week. The net-short position
of 379,012 last week had been the highest since at least January
2011, the starting point for the data.  Brent fell 0.3 percent in the week to June 11 to $102.96,
and traded at $106.11 a barrel as of 1:19 p.m. London time.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators such as  hedge funds  and
institutional investors, as well as commercial companies that
buy or sell futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and
investors follow changes in speculatorsâ€™ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  Swaps dealers  were net-long 245,348 lots, down 4.6 percent
from a week earlier, when their net-long position was at its
highest since May 14.  Money managers reduced net-short bets on European gasoil by
63 percent to 3,080 lots, bringing the net-short position to its
smallest since April 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
