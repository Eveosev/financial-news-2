In the mood for guacamole? How about an estate built on an avocado farm? Actor Dennis Franz and his wife, Joanie Franz, are selling  their Santa Barbara estate for $7.65 million . Franz, best known for his roles on “NYPD Blue” and “Hill Street Blues,” didn’t buy his home for the avocados, but because he and his wife saw “tremendous potential” in the avocado farm home, said listing agent Randy Solakian of  Coldwell Banker Previews International , who shares the listing with Deanna Solakian. “The Franzes have a keen eye for opportunity,” Solakian said. “They essentially built a new home in place of the original, leaving very little of the existing home and building all new around what was left.” Built in a New England style, the home at  2225 Featherhill Rd, Santa Barbara CA 93108  sits on 1.65 landscaped acres that include a covered loggia with wood-burning stoves and full outdoor kitchen, a 2-bedroom cabana, a pool and bocce ball court. “It’s a New England-style private garden estate in a semi-rural country setting between the mountains and Montecito upper village,” Solakian said. The residence itself measures 6,000 square feet and offers 6 bedrooms and 7.5 baths. The home opens from a generous-sized front porch and flows into an open floor plan. According to property records, the Franzes bought the home in 2010 for $2.15 million.  Using the Zillow mortgage calculator , a monthly payment on their home would be $28,848, assuming a 20 percent down payment on a 30-year mortgage.
