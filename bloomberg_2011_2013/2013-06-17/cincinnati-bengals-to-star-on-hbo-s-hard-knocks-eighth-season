The  Cincinnati Bengals  will be
featured on HBO Sports’ “Hard Knocks” for the second time as
the reality show returns for its eighth run during the National
Football League preseason.  The one-hour program, produced in conjunction with NFL
Films, will begin its five-episode season on Aug. 6 and conclude
Sept. 3, the league said in a statement.  “This year’s Bengals squad provides us with a compelling
combination of unique storylines: a veteran coaching staff,
young superstars, high-profile free agents and an intriguing
draft class,” Howard Katz, chief operating officer of NFL
Films, said in a statement.  The series debuted in 2001, featuring the Baltimore Ravens.
Other teams on past shows included the  Dallas Cowboys  in 2002
and 2008, the Kansas City Chiefs in 2007, the Bengals in 2009,
the  New York  Jets in 2010 and the  Miami Dolphins  in 2012.  “The feedback we got from our experience with ‘Hard
Knocks’ in 2009 was outstanding,” Bengals coach Marvin Lewis,
who is entering his 11th season with the team, said in a
statement. “Our fans enjoyed it tremendously and we’re happy to
try and provide that same experience again.”  The Bengals reached the playoffs for the second straight
year last season with a 10-6 record, losing to the Houston
Texans to open the playoffs.  Cincinnati signed former All-Pro linebacker  James Harrison 
in April and selected tight end Tyler Eifert with the 21st pick
of the NFL draft. Eifert has yet to sign a contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
