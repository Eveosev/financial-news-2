Nordex SE (NDX1) , a German turbine maker,
won an order to supply a 134.4-megawatt South African wind farm
developed by Cennergi (Pty) Ltd., a venture of Tata Power Co.  Nordex will start construction at the wind farm south of
Bedford, in the nation’s Eastern Cape, in the third quarter of
2014, the Hamburg-based turbine maker said in a  statement  on its
website. The facility should be operating by June 2016 and the
company’s contract includes a 10-year service agreement.  South Africa  plans to add 3,725 megawatts of renewable-energy capacity by the end of 2016 with a program of five
tenders to help curb its reliance on coal for electricity. The
country is targeting an additional 3,200 megawatts by the end of
the decade, with more than a third of that from wind power.  Cennergi is owned equally by Tata and  Exxaro Resources
Ltd. (EXX) , a South African coal producer. The companies on June 12
won 7 billion rand ($709 million) for two wind farms including
the Bedford project from  Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) ,  Nedbank Group
Ltd. (NED) ’s Nedbank Capital unit, and International Finance Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
