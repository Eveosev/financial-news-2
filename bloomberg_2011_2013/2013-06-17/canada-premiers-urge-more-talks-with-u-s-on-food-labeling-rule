Canada ’s western premiers want the
federal government to seek a “common understanding” with the
U.S. over stricter food-labeling rules before retaliating with
tariffs on American imports.  “We would prefer people to come to a common understanding
of how they will work on trade and allow goods and services to
flow without protectionist measures either initiated or
retaliated,” Manitoba Premier Greg Selinger said today at the
Western Premiers Conference in Winnipeg. Retaliation “is the
last resort,” he said.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said on May 23 it will
tighten country-of-origin labeling rules that specify where
animals are born, raised and slaughtered, even after the  World
Trade Organization  backed complaints from Canada and Mexico that
challenged the policy.  Canadian officials say the rules may compound
discrimination against livestock from Canada. The government has
since released a list of products imported from the U.S. that
may be targeted in retaliation for the labeling rules, including
corn, cheese and beef.  Leaders of the western provinces want to be consulted
before Canada proceeds with tariffs on U.S. imports, to ensure
the policies do not cause irreparable harm to provincial
economies, Selinger said.  Leaders of the western provinces and territories are in
Winnipeg for the annual Western Premiers’ Conference, which
includes representatives from Manitoba, Alberta, Saskatchewan,
British Columbia, Yukon,  Northwest Territories  and Nunavut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
