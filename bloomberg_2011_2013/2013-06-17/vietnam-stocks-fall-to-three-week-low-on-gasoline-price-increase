Vietnam ’s  stocks  fell, dragging the
benchmark index to a three-week low, after the Ministry of
Finance allowed retailers to raise gasoline prices, boosting
concern that inflation will accelerate.  The Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange’s VN Index fell 2.1
percent to 498.61 at 1:39 p.m. local time, heading for the
lowest close since May 23.  Vietnam Dairy Products Joint-Stock
Co., known as Vinamilk, dropped 3.7 percent, the most since
April 15. PetroVietnam Gas Joint-Stock Co., the country’s
biggest listed company by market value, lost 3.2 percent, poised
for the lowest close since June 4.  Vietnam National Petroleum Corp., the country’s largest
petroleum-products importer, raised prices of 92-RON, the most
commonly used grade of gasoline, by 420 dong per liter to 23,750
dong, it said on June 15. The company also raised diesel prices.
The risk of inflation still remains, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Vietnam’s
deputy prime minister said June 14.  The increase in gasoline prices plus “weak sentiment”
dragged the index lower today, said Michel Tosto, head of
institutional sales & brokerage at Viet Capital Securities Co.  The VN Index has declined 5.6 percent from this year’s high
on June 7. The gauge has risen 21 percent this year as slowing
inflation allowed the country’s central bank cut borrowing costs
eight times since March 2012 to spur growth. Vietnam’s inflation
rate eased to 6.36 percent in May, the lowest since August 2012,
from 6.61 percent in April.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
