The International Monetary Fund
should focus on its “core duties” once current aid programs
for troubled euro countries end, Martin Kotthaus, German Finance
Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble’s spokesman, said today.  While it’s helpful for the European Union to have the IMF
on board in carrying out programs for countries such as  Greece ,
the IMF wasn’t created to focus on Europe, Kotthaus said.  “It’s right and good that the IMF is with us” now,
Kotthaus said at a government press conference in Berlin today.
“In the long run, the IMF really has other duties than to prop
up the Europeans time and again.”  Kotthaus made his comments after Schaeuble told the
Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper yesterday that
Europe should solve its own problems in the long run, echoing
European Stability Mechanism chief Klaus Regling.  There’s no discussion of ending the IMF’s involvement in
the so-called troika, which also comprises the European
Commission and the European Central Bank, while programs are
under way, Kotthaus said. The fund has unmatched expertise in
reducing sovereign debt and implementing structural reforms,
Kotthaus said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
