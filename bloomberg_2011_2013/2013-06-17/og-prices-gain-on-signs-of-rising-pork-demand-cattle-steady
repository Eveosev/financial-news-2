Hog futures rallied for the first
time in three sessions on speculation that warmer weather will
boost demand for U.S. pork as more consumers grill outdoors.
Cattle prices were little changed.  Wholesale  pork  added 3.3 percent to $1.0432 a pound on June
14, the highest since Aug. 22, 2011, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. Prices added 8.1 percent last week, the
most in a year, USDA data show. Rains will be limited in the
Midwest early this week and temperatures will be at or above
normal for the next two weeks, according to an e-mailed report
from Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  “You’re seeing kind of the closing end of holiday
purchases” for the Fourth of July holiday, Lou Arens, a broker
at PCI Advisory Services in Waucoma,  Iowa , said in a telephone
interview. “Now that we’ve finally gotten to where the weather
is cooperating, you’re getting a little more demand from people
finally getting out and able to grill.”  Hog futures for August settlement rose 0.2percent to 96.975
cents a pound at 10:07 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
The most-active contract was up 13 percent this year through
June 14.  Independence Day  on July 4 is the most-popular day for
outdoor grilling, according to the Hearth, Patio and Barbecue
Association.  Cattle futures for August delivery rose less than 0.1
percent to $1.1835 a pound on the CME.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement climbed 0.2
