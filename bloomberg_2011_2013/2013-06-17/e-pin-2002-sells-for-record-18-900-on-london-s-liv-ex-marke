Wine from the 2002 vintage of
Chateau Le Pin, a Pomerol estate whose prices rival those of
close neighbour  Chateau Petrus , sold for a record 12,000 pounds
($18,900) a case on  London ’s Liv-ex wine market today.  The price was 6 percent up from 11,300 pounds a case paid
last August and 18 percent above the 10,200 pounds fetched in
November 2011, according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch
website. Since the vineyard only produces about 6,000 bottles a
year from its two hectares (five acres), the wine rarely trades.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen almost 6 percent
this year, buoyed by demand for rarer Pomerols and Burgundies,
with an 8 percent gain in the 10 weeks to mid-March pared by a 2
percent decline since then as the sales campaign for Bordeaux
2012 futures weighed on prices.  The 2002 Le Pins are the fourth most-expensive of the
latest 10 vintages trading, lagging only the 2005, 2009 and 2010
wines, according to merchant prices surveyed by Liv-ex.  Its 2009 and 2010 wines received perfect 100 scores from
U.S. critic  Robert Parker , while the 2002 was rated 93. Le Pin
was bought by Belgian merchant Jacques Thienpont in 1979 and was
one of the first of Pomerol’s niche producers whose prices were
driven in part by scarcity value.  Editors: Peter Torday, Sheldon Reback  To contact the reporter on this story:
