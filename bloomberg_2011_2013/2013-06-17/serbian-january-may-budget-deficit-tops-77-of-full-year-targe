Serbia’s budget gap widened to 77
percent of the full-year target in the first five months, as the
government continued to repay debts amid declining revenue
collection.  The central government’s deficit expanded to 93.6 billion
dinars ($1.1 billion) of the 122 billion-dinar shortfall planned
for the entire year. The consolidated gap, which includes both
central and local governments, totaled 78.3 billion dinars in
the first five months, as local governments and the nation’s
health fund ran budget surpluses, the  Finance Ministry  said on
its website on June 15.  Revenue collection of 312.05 billion dinars from January to
May was less than a third of the total the government planned to
raise in the whole of 2013. The five-month spending accounted
for 38 percent of the full-year target.  Premier  Ivica Dacic ’s Cabinet, in office since last July,
initially pledged to narrow this year’s budget gap to 3.6
percent of gross domestic product from 6.7 percent last year.
The government has been working for two weeks on measures to
contain the deficit within 4.7 percent of GDP. The measures
won’t include a freeze or cut in public wages and pensions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
