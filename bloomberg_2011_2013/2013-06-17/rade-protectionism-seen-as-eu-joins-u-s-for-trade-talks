The world’s largest economies are
adopting policies to impede global commerce as growth remains
sluggish, the World Trade Organization said in a study released
as the leaders of the Group of Eight industrial nations met.  During the past seven months, members of the expanded Group
of 20 nations implemented 109 measures to restrict trade, down
from 124 actions to limit commerce in the same period a year
earlier, according to the  report  today from the Geneva-based
WTO.  “To overcome protectionist threats and to prevent a self-destructive lapse into economic nationalism, G-20 economies need
to refocus their attention on reinforcing the multilateral
trading system,” it said.  The U.S. and 27-nation EU are set to announce the start of
negotiations soon for the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment
Partnership, which would create a free-trade zone with about $28
trillion in annual economic output, the largest in history. The
US and EU in recent months have sparred with  China  over its
support for goods including solar-energy equipment.  The trade-restrictive measures cited in the WTO report
include policies to stop imports from being sold below their
production costs, as well as tariff increases. The most
protected goods include electrical machinery, agricultural
products and mechanical appliances, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
