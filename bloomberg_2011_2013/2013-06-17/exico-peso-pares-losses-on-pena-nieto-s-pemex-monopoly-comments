Mexico’s peso pared losses after
President Enrique Pena Nieto said he’s negotiating with
lawmakers to break the state monopoly over oil and gas
exploration and production this year.  The currency declined 0.8 percent to 12.8201 per dollar at
2:13 p.m. in Mexico City after earlier falling as much as 1.3
percent. The peso rebounded as Pena Nieto’s comments boosted
confidence he’ll make good on his pledge to open up the state-controlled  energy industry , according to  Ramon Cordova , a
currency trader at Banco Base SA.  Pena Nieto said in an interview with  Bloomberg News  in
London that he envisions a model in which state-owned Petroleos
Mexicanos would develop certain fields, with others being tapped
by private companies. He said his administration will send the
energy bill to congress by September and he’s confident the so-called Pact for Mexico between the country’s top three political
parties will ensure the bill is approved by year-end.  “What the market wants is the reforms to pass,” Cordova
said by phone from in San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico. The
comments indicate “that the energy reform is on a good path and
it gives some more information because up until now it’s been
very opaque as to what are the actual points that the reform
will encompass.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
