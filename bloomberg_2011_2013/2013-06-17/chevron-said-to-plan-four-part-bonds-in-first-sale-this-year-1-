Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-largest
U.S. oil company, issued $6 billion of bonds in four parts for
its first sale of 2013.  The company’s $750 million of 0.889 percent, three-year
notes yield 40 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries; $2 billion of 1.718 percent, five-year securities
pay a relative yield of 65 basis points; $1 billion of 2.427
percent, seven-year debt pay an 85 basis-point spread; and $2.25
billion of 3.191 percent, 10-year bonds yield 100 more,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company canceled plans to offer floating-rate notes due
in 2016 and 2018, according to a person familiar with the
transaction, who asked not to be identified citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly.  Proceeds from the bonds, expected to be rated Aa1 by
Moody’s Investors Service, will be used to refinance commercial
paper, the person said.  Chevron “is finding it increasingly difficult to expand
production and add reserves as many of the remaining pools of
cheap, easily accessible resources” are owned by governments
and national  oil companies , David Schivell, an analyst at
Chicago-based research firm Morningstar Inc., wrote in a note
today. “Still, the company maintains a rock solid balance
sheet,” he said.  November Deal  Morningstar estimated a fair-value spread of 45 basis
points on the new three-year bonds, 55 basis points on the five-year, 70 for the seven-year and 90 on the 10-year, according to
the report.  Chevron last sold debt in November, issuing $2 billion each
of 1.104 percent, five-year debentures at a spread of 47 basis
points and 2.355 percent, 10-year securities at 72 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. The bonds due December 2022 traded at 95
cents on the dollar to yield 2.96 percent on June 11, or a
relative yield of 75 basis points, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  The average new issue concession on investment-grade bonds
in the U.S. reached 11 basis points last week, the highest since
the five days ended June 28, 2012, according to data from
Barclays Plc.  Barclays, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and  Wells
Fargo & Co . managed the offering for  San Ramon , California-based
Chevron, Bloomberg data show.  Exxon Mobil Corp. is the largest U.S. oil company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
