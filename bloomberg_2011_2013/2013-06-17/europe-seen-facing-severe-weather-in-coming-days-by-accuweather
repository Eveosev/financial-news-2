Europe  faces severe weather this
week, starting with scattered thunderstorms across northern
 Germany  and possibly Denmark today before damaging winds and
hail move east and south, AccuWeather Inc. forecast.  Storms will be widespread tomorrow over Poland, Belarus and
Ukraine, with Warsaw probably the largest population center at
risk of getting severe storms, AccuWeather  wrote  in an online
report today. By June 19, the storm will move to western Europe,
with the potential for heavy showers and thunderstorms in
 France , Belgium, and western Germany, the forecaster said.  A low pressure system across western and central Europe
will develop a warm and humid mass of air over the region, “the
perfect fuel” for severe weather, according to AccuWeather.  “Heavy downpours and large hail will be the primary threat
both days, however damaging wind gusts will also likely be
present,” AccuWeather wrote. “When any thunderstorm approaches
it’s best to take cover and get out of harm’s way.”  Paris, Dijon and Lyon in France are at risk of strong
storms on June 19, according to the forecaster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
