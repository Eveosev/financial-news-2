France  fought off what it called a
“unilateral attack” by the European Commission to keep
cultural subsidies off the agenda of trade talks with the U.S.  French Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti criticized
European Commission President  Jose Barroso  for calling France’s
protection of its audiovisual industry “reactionary” in an
interview with the  International Herald Tribune .  France won an exclusion for its audiovisual industry in
talks that began today with the U.S. over a free-trade pact with
the European Union. It threatened to use its veto to protect a
business that the Socialist minister said accounts for 3.3
percent of European gross domestic product.  “Barroso’s words are shocking and unacceptable,”
Filippetti told reporters today in Paris. “Without cultural
exception, we won’t be able to manage the regulatory
transformation to the digital age. We need new regulations for
the digital age, and to adapt our tools we need the cultural
exception. It is at the service of modernity.”  “It’s the European Commission that’s isolated,”
Filippetti said.  The European Union’s 27 member governments gave the
commission, the bloc’s executive arm, a mandate to negotiate
with the U.S. to expand the world’s biggest economic
relationship with a free trade agreement. The goal is to remove
tariffs, ease regulatory barriers and expand access in
investment, services and public procurement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
