Central Huijin Investment Ltd., a
unit of China’s sovereign wealth funds, increased its stakes in
the nation’s four biggest banks last week.  Central Huijin bought 19.3 million yuan-denominated A
shares in  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. (601398) , 24.5
million in  China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , 18.5 million in  Bank
of China Ltd. (3988)  and 42.9 million in  Agricultural Bank of China
Ltd. (601288)  on June 13, the four lenders said in separate exchange
 statements  yesterday. Central Huijin will continue to buy shares
in the banks in the following six months, according to the
statements.  The benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  has retreated 11
percent from this year’s high set on Feb. 6 amid concern the
economic recovery will falter. Mainland-traded shares of
AgriBank have dropped 4.6 percent this year while those of the
other three biggest banks are virtually unchanged.  Central Huijin also raised its holdings in New China Life
Insurance Co. and  China  Everbright Bank Co. last week. It last
increased the stakes in the biggest banks including ICBC and
Bank of China in April.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
