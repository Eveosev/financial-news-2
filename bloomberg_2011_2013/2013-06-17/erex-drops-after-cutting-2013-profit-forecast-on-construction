Terex Corp. (TEX) , the maker of cranes,
trucks and lifts, plunged the most in two years after reducing
its 2013 earnings forecast on a “softer” market for its
equipment used at construction sites and ports.  Terex fell 14 percent to $27.30 at 9:40 a.m. in  New York .
The shares earlier dropped 16 percent, the most intraday since
May 6, 2010.  Full-year earnings excluding some items will be $1.90 and
$2.10 a share, down from previous guidance of $2.40 to $2.70,
the Westport, Connecticut-based company said today in a
statement. Terex also said second-quarter earnings will be 50
cents to 60 cents a share. The average of 18 analysts’  estimates 
surveyed by Bloomberg was for second-quarter earnings of 82
cents a share, and profit of $2.55 for the full year.  Positive replacement demand for aerial work platform
products and “solid performance” for materials processing
won’t offset softer demand for construction and material
handling and port solutions, Terex Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Ron DeFeo  said in the statement.  “The level of sales growth has softened overall for Terex
when compared with the increases we originally anticipated for
2013,” DeFeo said. “Fundamentally,  North America  continues to
improve, but now at a slower pace, while Europe remains
challenging overall, and the markets in the rest of the world
are mixed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
