The  Netherlands ’  flower  and plant
exports, the world’s biggest, fell 3.9 percent in May as a cold
spring in parts of Europe hurt spending on garden plants.  Exports fell to 612.7 million euros ($817.6 million) last
month from 637.5 million euros in May 2012, the Aalsmeer,
Netherlands-based Dutch Agricultural Wholesale Board for Flowers
and Plants wrote in an online  report  today.  Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, had its second-wettest
May in 132 years, weather office Deutscher Wetterdienst
reported. In  France , May was an average 2 degrees Celsius (3.6
degrees Fahrenheit) colder than usual and 44 percent more rainy,
the Paris-based  Agriculture Ministry  said.  “The extremely long, cold spring in large parts of  Europe 
put a damper on sales of particularly garden plants,” the Dutch
board wrote. “That was on top of the effects of the economic
crisis, which means consumers have less to spend.”  Shipments to Germany, the biggest client for Dutch flowers
and plants, dropped 6.5 percent to 195.6 million euros, while
exports to France fell 6.7 percent to 77.6 million euros.  While shipments to northwest Europe may still show
“limited growth” this year, exports to southern Europe are
expected to continue to slide, with “not much view of
recovery,” the flower and plant board said.  Spain’s imports of Dutch greenery and blooms slumped 25
percent to 5.87 million euros last month, while Greek purchases
fell 22 percent to 1.62 million euros. Shipments to  Italy 
declined 9.1  percent to 27.3 million euros.  Exports of flowers and plants in the first five months of
2013 dropped 2.6 percent to 2.62 billion euros, according to the
report. The Netherlands’ exports of flowers and plants rose to
5.39 billion euros last year from 5.24 billion euros in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
