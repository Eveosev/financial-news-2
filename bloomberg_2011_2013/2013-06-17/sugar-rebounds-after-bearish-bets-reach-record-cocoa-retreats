Sugar extended gains in New York on
speculation investors have started buying futures after bearish
bets reached a record and millers in leading producer  Brazil 
directed more cane to making ethanol. Cocoa retreated.  Large and small speculators excluding index funds boosted
their net-short position, or bets on lower prices, to a record
121,030 contracts in the week ended June 11, U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission  data  showed. Millers in the center
south, Brazil’s main growing region, used 58 percent of all the
cane processed to make ethanol at the expense of sugar in the
second half of May, data from industry group Unica showed.
That’s up from 52 percent in the same period a year earlier.  Sugar rallied as much as 3.6 percent in the last trading
session to 17.12 cents a pound, a one-month high. Price gains
followed a rally in ethanol futures on the BM&F Bovespa,
Brazil’s futures exchange, a day earlier. The biofuel used in
flex-fuel cars gained as much as 2.4 percent on June 13 to 1,075
reais ($500) a cubic meter (35 cubic feet), data on Bloomberg
showed.  “The rally was partly explained as a late reaction to the
Unica figures,” Kingsman SA, a unit of  McGraw-Hill Financial
Inc. (MHFI) ’s Platts, said in a report e-mailed today. “We may have
seen a temporary bottom, but it is too early to say whether it
becomes more than that. The funds, however, are very short and
once they start short-covering their buying may snowball.”  Raw sugar for delivery in October was 0.4 percent higher at
17.15 cents a pound by 6:44 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, after rising to 17.24 cents, the highest since May 14.
White, or refined, sugar for delivery in August added 1.4
percent to $491.20 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  Cocoa for September delivery was down 0.4 percent at $2,244
a ton on ICE. Cocoa for delivery in July fell 0.5 percent to
1,457 pounds ($2,288) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa Beans  Ivory Coast, the top cocoa grower, will refund exporters
and processors buying undersized beans from June 17 to July 31,
industry regulator Le Conseil du Cafe-Cacao said on June 14. The
move comes after farmers said they weren’t able to sell supplies
because dry weather left beans too small to meet minimum
requirements. Growers are harvesting the smaller of the two
annual crops that runs from April to September.  Arabica coffee for September delivery gained 0.6 percent to
$1.245 a pound on ICE. Robusta coffee for September delivery
fell 0.3 percent to $1,758 a ton in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
