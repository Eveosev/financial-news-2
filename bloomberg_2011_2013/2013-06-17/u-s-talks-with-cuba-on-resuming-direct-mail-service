Cuban and U.S. officials will meet
in  Washington  tomorrow and the next day to discuss possible
direct mail service between their nations.  The U.S. and Cuba haven’t had direct postal service since
1963, following the communist revolution in Cuba.  “This is something that the U.S. has felt would be a
positive step for the Cuban people,” State Department
spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters today. “We felt it was in
our interest.”  Talks over mail service were last held in  Havana  in 2009,
and have been on hold for the last few years over detainee
issues. The U.S. is demanding that Cuba release jailed American
subcontractor Alan Gross, while Cuba wants the U.S. to release
Cubans convicted of espionage and serving prison terms in the
U.S.  The talks this week, which include representatives of the
U.S. Postal Service, will focus on mail delivery and don’t
reflect broader policy shifts regarding Cuba, Psaki said during
a briefing in Washington.  “It’s not meant to be a signal of anything or indicate a
change in policy,” Psaki said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
