The Bundesbank said  Germany ’s
economic recovery may lose pace after improving in the second
quarter.  “After a weak start into the year gross domestic product
is expected to improve markedly in the second quarter,” the
Frankfurt-based central bank said in its monthly report today.
“For the summer, however, signs of a slowdown in growth are
emerging.”  The German  economy  expanded 0.1 percent in the first three
months of this year as the recession in the euro area extended
to a record sixth quarter. The Bundesbank this month cut its
2013 growth projection to 0.3 percent from the 0.4 percent it
predicted in December, and said Europe’s largest economy would
grow by 1.5 percent in 2014, down from the previously-estimated
1.9 percent.  The growth forecasts are subject to “an increase in the
dynamics of the world economy” and euro-area countries in
recession “gradually changing their path back to growth,” the
Bundesbank said in today’s report.  The  European Central Bank  this month kept its benchmark
 interest rate  at a record low of 0.5 percent and President  Mario Draghi  said economic activity in the euro area, Germany’s
biggest export market, “should stabilize and recover in the
course of the year, albeit at a subdued pace.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
