U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
will urge his G-8 counterparts to end the payment of terrorists’
ransom demands to stem funding to al-Qaeda in north  Africa .  At a meeting of Group of Eight leaders in Enniskillen,
 Northern Ireland  tomorrow, Cameron will lead a discussion on how
to tackle the threat of terrorism in the Maghreb region, where
al-Qaeda has collected 33 million euros ($44 million) in ransom
payments in the last three years, according to a British
official who asked not to be identified citing government rules.  Paying ransom is illegal under British law and the U.S and
Canada also don’t give in to terrorist demands, unlike the other
five nations in the group --  France , Germany, Italy, Japan and
Russia. The average ransom paid is $2.5 million per hostage,
according to the U.K. official.  “On some of the issues on the G8 agenda -- for instance,
trying to make sure that we stop countries paying ransoms to
terrorist kidnappers -- I want a declaration,” Cameron told the
Foreign Press Association in London on June 13. “I want
countries to sign up to a tangible agreement.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
