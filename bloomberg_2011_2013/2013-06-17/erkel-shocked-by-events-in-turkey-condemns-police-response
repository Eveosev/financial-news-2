German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
she was “shocked” by the violence in  Turkey  and condemned the
police response to protests as authorities in Istanbul detained
hundreds of demonstrators.  After police cleared protesters and activists from
Istanbul’s Gezi Park over the weekend, spurring clashes that
spread from Taksim Square, Merkel was asked about the violence
in the context of Turkey’s bid to join the European Union.  “What’s happening in Turkey at the moment doesn’t conform
to our understanding of freedom to gather and free speech,”
Merkel said in an interview today in Berlin with RTL television.
“There were some terrible pictures in which you can see that
action was taken that in my view was much too heavy-handed.”  The chancellor declined to criticize Turkish Prime Minister
 Recep Tayyip Erdogan , who told a mass rally yesterday that “we
will demand a reckoning” as he lambasted the demonstrators.
Police yesterday fired tear gas along side streets off the
square and nearby neighborhoods, beating and arresting
protesters.  Merkel in February sought to give momentum to negotiations
on Turkey’s EU bid when she visited Erdogan in Ankara, though
Germany is among countries casting doubt on moving forward on
talks in light of the violence,  Der Spiegel  reported June 12.  “I wish those who are critical as well as those who have
other opinions -- and even have another idea of society -- that
they’ll have a space in the Turkey of the 21st century,” Merkel
said in the interview before leaving for a Group of Eight summit
in  Northern Ireland .  To contact the reporter on this story:
