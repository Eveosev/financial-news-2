The dollar strengthened against the
majority of its 16 most-traded counterparts amid speculation
about when the  Federal Reserve  will begin to taper its monetary
stimulus.  The U.S. currency briefly pared gains and fell versus the
euro amid conflicting reports before the central bank starts a
two-day policy meeting tomorrow. The yen fell versus the
greenback for the first time in five days as stocks gained,
reflecting reduced haven demand. The euro climbed to almost a
four-month high against the dollar as data showed the 17-nation
bloc’s  trade surplus  was at almost a record in April.  “The whole day has been driven by U.S. dollar moves,”
Charles St-Arnaud, a foreign-exchange strategist at Nomura
Holdings Inc. in New York, said in a telephone interview. “The
idea that the Fed might temper their purchases has thrown a bit
of a cold shower on investors.”  The dollar rose 0.2 percent to 94.51 per yen at 5 p.m. New
York time, after falling 3.3 percent last week, the most since
July 2009.  Japan ’s currency slid 0.6 percent to 126.32 per euro
after appreciating 2.7 percent last week, the most since the
five days ended July 6. The euro added 0.2 percent to $1.3367,
almost the highest since Feb. 13.  Options Trade  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $26.5 billion, compared with $34.6 billion on June 14,
according to data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust
Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on
the dollar-yen  exchange rate  was $7.4 billion, the largest share
of trades at 28 percent. Australian dollar-U.S. dollar options
were the second most-actively traded, at $3.8 billion, or 14
percent.  Yen-dollar options trading was 1 percent more than the
average for the past five Mondays at a similar time in the day.
Aussie-greenback options trading was 65 percent more than
average.  The Brazilian real decreased for a second day against the
dollar as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut the country’s growth
forecast to 2.5 percent from 3.3 percent, citing
“disappointing” first-quarter figures. The currency fell 0.9
percent to 2.1712 per dollar after earlier declining to 2.1777,
its weakest level since May 2009.  Peso Drops  Mexico ’s peso fell versus all 16 of its most-traded peers
as  RBC Capital Markets  said it could see “some short-term
losses” and potentially cut rates after the Fed’s policy
statement on June 19. The currency depreciated 1 percent to
12.8361 per dollar after falling to 12.8796.  India ’s rupee dropped the most in a week as the central
bank left borrowing costs unchanged amid concern U.S. monetary
policy makers will signal a reduction in asset purchases that
have boosted inflows to  emerging markets .  The  Reserve Bank  of India held its repurchase rate at 7.25
percent today. The rupee slid 0.6 percent to 57.8663 per dollar,
the biggest drop since June 10.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index of shares gained 1.2 percent
while Japan’s  Topix index  added 2.7 percent and the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.8 percent.  Yields (USGG10YR)  on 10-year
Treasuries rose to 2.18 percent after touching 2.1 percent on
June 14, the lowest level in a week.  Risk-On Environment  “It looks like there’s some risk-on back on the table,”
said  Fabian Eliasson , head of U.S. currency sales at Mizuho
Financial Group Inc., by phone from New York. “The obvious
focus on the week is going to be the Fed meeting, and I think
we’re going to sidestep around that until then.”  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on May 22 the central
bank could reduce its monthly purchases of $45 billion of
Treasuries and $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities, known
as quantitative easing, if the employment outlook shows
sustained improvement.  The Financial Times reported Bernanke will probably signal
the central bank’s monthly purchases will be reduced, while
further cuts will depend on the economy. The newspaper’s
reporter later posted on Twitter that he didn’t have
confirmation from Fed officials and urged investors to “chill
out.”  The euro-area  trade surplus  narrowed to 16.1 billion euros
from a revised 18.1 billion euros in March, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today. The March reading
was the most since the common currency was introduced in 1999.  The yen has fallen 6.7 percent this year, the worst
performer among the 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar has risen 2.6
percent and the euro gained 4.1 percent.  The JPMorgan Global FX Volatility Index rose to a one-year
high of 11.43 percent on June 13. The gauge has climbed from
7.05 percent in December, the lowest since July 2007, and was at
10.3 percent today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
