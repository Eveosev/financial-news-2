Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) , the world’s
biggest maker of health-care products, agreed to pay as much as
$1 billion to buy Aragon Pharmaceuticals Inc. and gain the
closely held company’s experimental prostate cancer drug.  Aragon will receive an initial cash payment of $650
million,  New Brunswick , New Jersey-based J&J said in a statement
today. Additional payments totaling as much as $350 million may
follow if San Diego-based Aragon’s prostate cancer program
achieves certain milestones, J&J said.  The company’s lead compound, ARN-509, is in the second of
three stages usually required for U.S. regulatory approval and
may supplement Zytiga, the prostate cancer treatment J&J
unveiled two years ago. It would compete against  Medivation
Inc. (MDVN) ’s Xtandi,  Dendreon Corp. (DNDN) ’s Provenge, and Xofigo from  Bayer
AG (BAYN)  and  Algeta ASA (ALGETA)  for tumors resistant to hormone therapy.  “The patent for Zytiga expires at the end of 2016 in the
U.S.,” Derrick Sung, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said
in a note to clients today. “ARN-509 would serve the purpose of
both extending the longevity of J&J’s prostate cancer franchise
as well as providing a potentially complementary therapy to
Zytiga,” he wrote.  J&J  rose  less than 1 percent to $85.63 at the close of New
York trading. The shares have gained 30 percent in the past 12
months. Medivation, based in San Francisco, fell 6.8 percent to
$47.41.  Block Androgen  J&J will receive Aragon’s entire program for drugs that
block androgen, a hormone that can fuel tumors in the prostate.  “Prostate cancer is one of our main areas of focus, and we
are pleased to be adding ARN-509 to our portfolio,” Peter F.
Lebowitz, the head of oncology research for J&J’s Janssen
Research & Development unit, said in a statement.  Aragon’s remaining assets will be spun off to a new company
called Seragon Pharmaceuticals before the purchase by J&J is
completed,  Aragon  said in a separate statement. J&J won’t have a
stake in that venture or rights to products it might produce.  J&J was the fastest-growing company among large
pharmaceutical makers last year, buoyed by eight new medicines
that generated $4.4 billion in new sales in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
