U.S. President  Barack Obama  and his
Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, remain divided on key
issues in handling the Syrian civil war with the two powers now
openly arming opposing sides.  “Of course our opinions do not coincide but all us have
the intention to stop the violence in  Syria ,” Putin said after
meeting with Obama in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, where they
are attending a summit of leaders from the Group of Eight
nations. Still, he said both leaders agree that the violence in
Syria must end.  “We do have different perspectives on the problem but we
share an interest in reducing the violence” and in securing
Syria’s stocks of chemical weapons so that they’re neither used
in the conflict nor subject to proliferation, Obama said.  The White House, declaring that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had crossed a “red line” Obama previously drew by using
chemical weapons against rebels, announced last week that the
U.S. would begin sending direct military aid to the Syrian
opposition.  Russia  continues to arm Assad, a long-time ally.  European nations, led by  France  and the U.K., both also
participating in the summit, have pressed the U.S. to take
stronger action on Syria even as Russia has thwarted efforts to
sanction Assad in the United Nations Security Council.  To contact the reporters on this story:
