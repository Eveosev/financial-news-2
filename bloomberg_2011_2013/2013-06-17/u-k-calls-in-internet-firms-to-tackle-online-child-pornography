U.K. Culture Secretary Maria Miller
will hold discussions with Internet firms today to tackle child
pornography following the murders of two children in the last
year by men inspired by material available online.  Yahoo! Inc., Google Inc., BT Group Plc, Microsoft Corp.,
Twitter Inc., Facebook Inc., British Sky Broadcasting Group,
Virgin Media Inc., TalkTalk Telecom Group Plc, Vodafone Group
Plc, O2 and Three will attend the meeting in  London .  “Child abuse images are horrific and widespread public
concern has made it clear that the industry must take action,”
Miller will say, according to remarks released by her office.
“In recent days we have seen these companies rush to do more
because of the pressure of an impending summit. Imagine how much
more can be done if they turn their minds to tackling the
issues.”  Google pledged funding this month for U.K. charity The
Internet Watch Foundation and to a U.S. charity for missing and
exploited children alongside money toward its own Child
Protection Technology Fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
