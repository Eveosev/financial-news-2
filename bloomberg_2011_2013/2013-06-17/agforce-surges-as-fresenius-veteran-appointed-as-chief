Magforce AG (MF6) , the German maker of
magnetic-field technology to break down brain tumors, rose to a
10 1/2-month high after appointing former Fresenius Medical Care
AG Chief Executive Officer Ben Lipps as its new CEO.  Magforce surged as much as 32 percent to 3.75 euros, the
highest intraday price since Aug. 1, and was trading up 26
percent at 12:40 p.m. in Frankfurt. Volume was more than six
times the three-month daily average. Lipps, 72, who stepped down
from Fresenius in December after almost 14 years at the helm,
will continue to advise the dialysis provider, Berlin-based
Magforce said in a statement on June 14.  Magforce chose the Fresenius veteran to manage its
transformation into a worldwide medical-device provider for
cancer treatment. The company’s Nanotherm technology, which
fights cancer by applying heat through magnetic fields to
nanoparticles containing iron oxide that have been injected into
the tumors, has been approved in 27 European countries.  “Our focus will be to advance this therapy to the next
level with its widespread commercialization, and to build a
global player in the area of cancer treatment for the good of
patients,” Lipps said in the statement.  Lipps gained recognition at the end of the 1960s, when he
led the research team that developed the first commercial
hollow-fiber artificial kidney, a product that more than 2
million dialysis patients rely on today for life-sustaining
treatment.  Magforce’s Nanotherm therapy is available at the Charite
hospital in Berlin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
