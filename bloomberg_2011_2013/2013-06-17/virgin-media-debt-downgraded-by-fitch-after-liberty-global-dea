Virgin Media Inc., the British
television and Internet company owned by  John Malone ’s  Liberty
Global Plc (LBTYA) , was downgraded to four levels below investment grade
by Fitch Ratings.  Fitch cut Virgin Media three levels to B+ from BB+, the
ratings agency said today in a statement. Fitch expects Liberty
Global to increase Virgin Media’s debt levels as it pushes
financing for the deal onto its new unit’s books.  Liberty Global agreed to buy Virgin Media for $16 billion
in cash and stock in February in the biggest media deal since
the merger that created Thomson Reuters Corp. in 2007. Malone is
expanding across Europe, challenging Rupert Murdoch, who
controls about 39 percent in  British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc. (BSY)   Within a week of announcing the deal, Virgin Media raised
$3.65 billion in bonds and sought about $4.7 billion in loans as
part of a financing package to help fund the acquisition.  The company is rated Ba1 at Moody’s. That’s one level below
investment grade.  Standard & Poor’s  rates the company’s debt BB,
two levels below investment grade. Both companies have a
negative outlook on Virgin Media.  To contact the reporter on this story:
