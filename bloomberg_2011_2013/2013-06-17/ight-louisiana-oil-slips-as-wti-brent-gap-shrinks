Light Louisiana Sweet crude traded
at the smallest premium to benchmark West Texas Intermediate in
more than two years, tracking a parallel move in Brent oil.  Brent’s  premium  to WTI shrank to $7.44 a barrel, the least
since Jan. 20, 2011, based on August settlement prices for both
futures contracts. Light Louisiana Sweet traded at its lowest
premium to WTI since the same date. When WTI strengthens against
Brent, it often weakens the value of U.S. grades that compete
with foreign crudes priced against the international benchmark.  The premiums for Light Louisiana Sweet and Heavy Louisiana
Sweet over WTI each weakened by 65 cents to $8.25 a barrel and
$8.35 a barrel, respectively, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg at 1:44 p.m. in  New York .  Eugene Island crude’s premium narrowed by 45 cents to $4.95
a barrel over WTI, and Bonito Sour weakened by 40 cents to $5.20
over WTI.  Poseidon’s premium shrank 50 cents to a $1.65 a barrel, and
Mars Blend also weakened 50 cents, to $2.40 a barrel over WTI.
Southern Green Canyon fell 60 cents a barrel to a $1.40 premium.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , which has a lower sulfur
content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, fell 35
cents a barrel to $5.40 over WTI.  Bakken was unchanged at a premium of $2.25 a barrel against
WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
