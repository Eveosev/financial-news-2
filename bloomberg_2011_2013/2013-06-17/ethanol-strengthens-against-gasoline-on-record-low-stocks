Ethanol gained versus gasoline on
concern that lower production of the biofuel will keep
stockpiles near record lows.  The spread, or price difference, narrowed 4.56 cents to
35.11 cents a gallon on speculation that tighter corn supplies,
the primary feedstock for ethanol production in the U.S., will
curtail output of the biofuel. One bushel of the grain makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  “Ethanol traders are torn between a potentially tight
domestic ethanol market this summer and imports that are
scheduled to arrive over the next 60 days as plants are
scheduled to go down,” Justin Dirico, manager of the biofuels
desk at Eagle Energy Brokers LLC in New York, said in a report
today.  Denatured ethanol for July delivery increased 0.5 cent to
$2.505 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices are up 14
percent this year.  Gasoline for July delivery decreased 4.06 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $2.8561 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Stockpiles of the biofuel in the week ended June 7 fell 2.6
percent to 16 million barrels, the lowest level in records going
back to June 2010, a report from the Energy Information
Administration showed June 12.  Ethanol Output  Production has averaged 825,000 barrels a day so far this
year, down 9 percent from the same period a year earlier, data
from the Energy Department’s analytical arm show.  The worst U.S. drought since the 1930s wilted corn crops
last summer and forced ethanol producers to temper operations
because the fuel was unprofitable to manufacture.  Corn for July delivery climbed 13.5 cents, or 2.1 percent,
to $6.685 a bushel in  Chicago . The corn crush spread, or the
cost difference between a gallon of ethanol and the corn needed
to make it, was 7 cents, down from 12 cents on June 14, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Higher ethanol prices have led to increased imports of the
biofuel.  Imports have averaged 17,000 barrels a day this year
through June 7, up from 6,000 barrels a day during the same
period in 2012, EIA data show.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 94 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool on June 7, up from 89 percent the previous
week, EIA said.  Each gallon of ethanol is assigned a tracking certificate
known as a Renewable Identification Number, or RIN. A refiner
can keep the credit to show compliance with the mandate, or
trade it.  Ethanol RINs  Corn-based ethanol RINs for 2013  rose 1 cent to 93 cents,
at 3:48 p.m. data compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs,
which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol,
were unchanged at 99.5 cents.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago gained 7 cents
to $2.58 a gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In the U.S.
Gulf, prices increased 3.5 cents to $2.645; on the West Coast
the additive rose 3.5 cents to $2.84; and in  New York  the
biofuel jumped 2 cents to $2.615 a gallon.  Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor narrowed 5 cents to
3.5 cents, the tightest since June 6, while the West Coast’s
premium to U.S. Gulf was unchanged at 19.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
