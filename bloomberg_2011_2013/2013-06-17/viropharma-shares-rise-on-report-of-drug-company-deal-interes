ViroPharma Inc. (VPHM) , the maker of a drug
for a rare disease, rose the most in five months after a report
that drug companies may be interested in buying the company.  The Exton, Pennsylvania-based biotechnology company gained
6.3 percent to $28.87 at the close in New York, the biggest
single-day increase since Jan. 15. Reuters reported that
ViroPharma is a potential acquisition target, citing
unidentified sources familiar with the issue.  ViroPharma sells Cinryze, a drug for hereditary angioedema,
a genetic disease that afflicts at least 6,000 people in the
U.S. and can cause airway obstruction, according to a
description on the company website. Sales of the drug were
$327.1 million last year, representing 76 percent of the
company’s $427.9 million 2012 revenue, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  A spokeswoman for ViroPharma didn’t return a call asking
for comment on the report.  Robert Langreth in  New York  at +1-212-617-1886 or
