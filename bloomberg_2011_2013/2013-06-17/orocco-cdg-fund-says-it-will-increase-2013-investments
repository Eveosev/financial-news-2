Caisse de Depot et de Gestion,
 Morocco ’s biggest institutional fund, said it plans to deliver
52 percent of a five-year investment plan as it boosts spending
by the end of 2013.  CDG invested 19 billion dirhams ($2.3 billion) in 2011 and
2012 as part of its plan to spend 65 billion dirhams by 2015, it
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. Investments this year
may rise by as much as 15 billion dirhams, it said.  CDG has more than 100 billion dirhams in assets, including
over half of the country’s treasury bills and several stakes in
stocks listed on the Casablanca bourse, according to data on the
fund’s website.  Prominent figures in Justice and Development, the Islamist
party leading the government since November 2011, have been
critical of CDG Director General Anass Houir-Alami’s record and
that of his predecessor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
