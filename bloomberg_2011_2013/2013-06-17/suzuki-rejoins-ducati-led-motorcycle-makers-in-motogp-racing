the FIM Road Racing Grand Prix MotoGP in 2015, returning to the
motorcycle championship to gain knowledge of new technology for
future models.  The company will take part in  testing  at the Catalunya
circuit in  Spain  today, according to the Hamamatsu City, Japan-based motorcycle maker. The testing team will be led by  Davide
Brivio , who previously managed the Fiat-Yamaha MotoGP team,

four GP racer for MotoGP, it said in the statement.  Ducati Motor Holding SpA,  Yamaha Motor Co. (7272)  and Honda are
