OnCure Holdings Inc., which provides
equipment and management services to cancer clinics in three
states, filed for bankruptcy blaming cuts in federal health-insurance payments.  OnCure, based in Englewood, Colorado, plans to sell itself
at auction while under court protection, with an initial bid of
$125 million from an undisclosed company, Chief Executive
Officer Bradford Burkett said in a declaration filed June 15.  The company listed assets of $179.3 million and debt of
$250.4 million in a filing in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
Wilmington,  Delaware . OnCure began seeing fewer patients in
2011. On Jan. 1, the government-run Medicare and Medicaid
programs cut reimbursement rates by 7 percent, Burkett said.  “These challenges left the debtors in a substantially
 overleveraged  position,” Burkett said. The company said it has
$210 million in senior secured notes maturing in 2017 with an
interest rate of 11.75 percent.  OnCure is at least the third health-care company to file
for bankruptcy with $200 million or more in debt since April.
 Rotech Healthcare Inc. (ROHIQ) , a provider of home respiratory products,
and Sound Shore Medical Center of Westchester, an affiliate of
 New York  College of Medicine, also blamed Medicare cuts for
their bankruptcies.  OnCure employs 370 people and provides services to 32
radiation-treatment centers in Florida and  California  and one in
Indiana. GenStar Capital LLC took over the company in 2006 and
owns more than 70 percent of it, according to court records.  Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation, a common
measure of financial strength, declined to about $94 million
last year from $103 million in 2011, OnCure said.  Under the proposed auction rules, OnCure for two months
will be free to seek a higher initial bid. The company plans to
release details on the current bidder at a court hearing
tomorrow, Burkett said.  The case is In re OnCure Holdings, Inc., 13-bk-11540, U.S
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
