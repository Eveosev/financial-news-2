The number of condominiums offered
for sale in  Tokyo  and surrounding areas in May surged 49
percent, the biggest gain in more than a year, as  Japan ’s
economy started to show signs of improvement.  Developers put 4,967 apartments on the market in May,
compared with 3,329 units a year earlier, the  Real Estate
Economic Research Institute Co.  said in a report released in
Tokyo today. The last time the monthly data had a bigger gain
was April 2012, when it rose 82 percent.  More apartments are being offered in the market to capture
potential buyers as Japan accelerates efforts under Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe to end deflation and boost the world’s
third-largest economy. The supply of new apartments in Tokyo
this year will reach the highest level since 2007 on the back of
the economic recovery, according to an estimate by the
institute.  “Potential buyers probably want to buy because of concerns
that  interest rates  and prices will start to increase,” Akio
Fukuda, a manager at the Real Estate Economic Research
Institute, said at a press conference in Tokyo.  Gross domestic product expanded an annualized 4.1 percent
in the first quarter, compared with a preliminary calculation of
3.5 percent, the Cabinet Office said in Tokyo last week. Nominal
GDP, which is unadjusted for changes in prices, rose 0.6 percent
from the previous three months, leaving the economy 7 percent
smaller than in the same period in 1997.  Consumer confidence  in
May was at its highest level since 2007, a Cabinet Office survey
showed.  The number of new apartments put on the market will rise
9.6 percent to about 50,000 units in 2013, according the Tokyo-based industry researcher. The institute had a forecast of 4,000
units for the month of May.  The Topix Real Estate Index, a measure of 43 property-related stocks, fell 0.8 percent at the close of trading in
Tokyo, paring an earlier loss of as much as 3.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
