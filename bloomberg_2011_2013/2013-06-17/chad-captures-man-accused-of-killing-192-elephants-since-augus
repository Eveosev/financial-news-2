Chadian authorities captured a man
they accused of leading a group of poachers that killed 89
elephants in a single night in March, Environment Minister
Mahamat Issa Halikimi said.  Hassan Idriss, also known as Gargaf, is suspected of
slaughtering 192 of the animals since August, Halikimi told
reporters in the capital, N’Djamena. Idriss, who was presented
to journalists today along with 124 tusks that were seized when
he was captured on June 13, led a gang of more than 50 poachers
who hunted the pachyderms on horseback, he said.  “It is unacceptable that lawless men roam our forests and
carry out massacres of large animals when efforts to protect the
environment in our country are well recognized
internationally,” Halikimi said.  The killing of the 89 elephants on the night of March 14
and 15 was the worst poaching incident in the region since
February 2012, when 300 of the animals were killed in Cameroon.
The World Wildlife Fund estimates that the illegal trade in
wildlife is worth $19 billion a year, the fourth-largest illict
market after narcotics, counterfeit products and human
trafficking, according to its  website .  Idriss has been operating in the central Cameroon-Chad
border region since 2011, Halikimi said. In addition to the
attack in March, Idriss is also accused of poaching 63 elephants
in August 2012, and a further 40 in October in which five
Cameroonian forest rangers were killed, he said.  Chad plans to establish a monitoring centre to step up the
fight against poachers, Halikimi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
