President  Barack Obama  said the U.S.
will be the host for the first round of negotiations on a trade
agreement with the European Union that will support hundreds of
jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.  The Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership will
enhance an existing economic relationship that already is the
largest in the world, Obama said in Enniskillen, Northern
Ireland, where leaders of the Group of Eight industrial nations
opened a two-day summit.  The idea for the agreement “has been warmly received in
the United States,” Obama said in a statement alongside British
Prime Minister David Cameron, European Commission President  Jose Manuel Barroso  and European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy .
Reaching a deal “is going to be a priority of mine and my
administration.”  The European Commission estimates an agreement, which might
take two years to close, would generate annual economic benefits
of 119 billion euros ($159 billion) for Europe and $126 billion
(95 billion euros) to the U.S.  To contact the reporters on this story:
