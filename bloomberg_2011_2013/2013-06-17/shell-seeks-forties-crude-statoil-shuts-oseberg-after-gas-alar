Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  failed to buy
North Sea Forties crude at a higher differential than a previous
bid.  Eni SpA (ENI)  sought to purchase a Russian Urals blend in the
Mediterranean for the fourth day. The company lowered its bid
from a four-month high in the previous session.  Oil and natural gas output from the Oseberg Field Center
was halted earlier today after a gas alarm, according to the
operator  Statoil ASA. (STL)   North Sea  Shell didn’t manage to buy Forties at 5 cents a barrel more
than Dated Brent for loading on either July 1 to July 3 or July
4 to July 6, a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window showed. That compares with
a discount of 30 cents for a bid on June 14.  Gunvor Group was unable to buy the grade for July 8 to July
14 at 15 cents less than Dated Brent, the survey showed.  No bids or offers were made for Ekofisk and Oseberg.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days was at 6 cents less than Dated Brent, compared
with a discount of 10 cents on June 14, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for August settlement traded at $105.99 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $106.04 in the previous session. The September
contract was at $105.63 at the same time today, a discount of 36
cents to August.  Oseberg stopped pumping at 7:07 a.m. local time today, Ola
Anders Skauby, a Statoil spokesman, said by phone from
Stavanger,  Norway . “We don’t know when it will restart because
we are looking for the cause of the gas alarm going off.”  Nine Oseberg blend cargoes of 600,000 barrels each are
scheduled to load this month, two more than in May, according to
a revised loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News . This is
equivalent to a daily rate of 180,000 barrels.  Mediterranean/Urals  Eni failed to buy 80,000 metric tons of Urals for June 30
to July 4 at 30 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent on a
delivered basis to Augusta in  Italy , compared with its bid at a
discount of 5 cents on June 14, according to the survey.  Total SA sought to buy 100,000 tons of the blend for June
30 to July 4 loading at parity to Dated Brent on a delivered
basis to Rotterdam, the survey showed.  Urals in the Mediterranean rose by 1 cent to a discount of
4 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was unchanged at 23
cents to the benchmark.  Russia will export seven cargoes of 100,000 tons each of
Urals from Primorsk in the first five days of July, according to
a preliminary loading plan obtained by Bloomberg. Ust-Luga will
load three lots from June 30 to July 5, the program showed.  Urals exports from Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea  will be
two 140,000-ton lots and two 80,000-ton cargoes from July 1 to
July 5, according to the schedule. One shipment of 80,000 tons
of Siberian Light will also be shipped from this port.  OAO Surgutneftegas issued a tender offering 100,000 tons of
Urals for loading on July 2 to July 3 from Ust-Luga, according
to three people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be
identified because the information is confidential. The tender
closes tomorrow.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe was at $2.30 a barrel more than
Dated Brent, unchanged from the previous session, data compiled
by Bloomberg showed.  Bharat Petroleum  issued a tender to buy crude for loading
on Aug. 1 to Aug. 15, according to a document obtained by
Bloomberg News. The tender closes June 20, with offers valid
until the following day.  Hindustan Petroleum also issued a tender, seeking West
African,  North Sea  Brent and Libyan grades also for loading in
August, another document showed. This tender closes on June 19
and offers are valid until June 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
