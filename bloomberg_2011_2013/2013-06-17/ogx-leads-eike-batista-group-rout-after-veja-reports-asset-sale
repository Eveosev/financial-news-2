OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA
fell the most in almost a year, leading declines by companies
controlled by  Eike Batista , after Veja magazine reported the
Brazilian billionaire is selling more assets to raise funds.  Oil producer OGX slumped 15 percent to a record 82 centavos
in  Sao Paulo  today, while miner MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA
 slid  14 percent and port developer  LLX Logistica SA (LLXL3)   lost  8.4
percent. The three Batista units were the worst performers in
 Brazil ’s Ibovespa  index , which fell 0.5 percent.  Batista’s holding company EBX Group Co. is selling assets,
reducing staff and trimming the scope of projects as his
commodities and logistics startups accumulate losses. OGX
tumbled 22 percent last week after the billionaire disclosed he
sold shares of its flagship oil producer for the first time.  His entertainment joint venture IMX is for sale, Veja
magazine columnist Lauro Jardim reported June 15, without citing
anyone. IMX’s press office declined to comment on the report.
EBX, the holding for most of Batista’s assets, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the share-price decline today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
