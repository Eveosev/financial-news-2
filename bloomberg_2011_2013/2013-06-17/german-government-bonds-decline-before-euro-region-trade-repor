German  government bonds  declined,
with 10-year bunds falling for the first time in five days,
before a report on the euro area’s trade balance.  The benchmark  10-year yield  climbed from the lowest level
in more than a week. European Central Bank policy makers  Joerg
Asmussen , Jens Weidmann and Yves Mersch are scheduled to speak
today. France is due to sell as much as 7.6 billion euros ($10.1
billion) of Treasury bills, while the Netherlands plans to
auction up to 4 billion euros of 103- and 226-day securities.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 1.54 percent at 7:16 a.m. London time.
The rate fell to 1.51 percent on June 14, the lowest since June
7. The 1.5 percent security due in May 2023 fell 0.23, or 2.30
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 99.64. The nation’s two-year yield added one basis point to 0.14 percent.  German bonds handed investors a loss of 0.7 percent this
year through June 14, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
Italian securities returned 3 percent and Spanish bonds gained
