Bank profits tumbled 13.8 percent
last year in  China ’s eastern coastal province of Zhejiang,
adding to signs of stress in the financial system of the world’s
second-biggest economy.  Lenders’ net income fell to 119.3 billion  yuan  ($19.5
billion), the People’s Bank of China said in a  report  on June
14, one of 33 detailing finances across China’s provinces and
municipalities.  Investors are focused on the strength of China’s financial
system after a jump in money-market rates, a slowdown in
economic  growth  and a surge in non-traditional banking channels.
In Zhejiang, lenders have faced an increase in bad loans because
of a collapse in private financing that helped leave some
businesses broke.  In Zhejiang, banks’ bad loans stood at 106 billion yuan at
the end of April, accounting for 1.66 percent of the total
advances, the Shanghai Securities News reported today, citing
Vice Governor Zhu Congjiu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
