The pound was little changed versus
the dollar and euro as an industry report showed U.K. home
sellers raised asking prices for a sixth month in June.  Sterling climbed to a four-month high versus the U.S.
currency last week.  Prices sought  rose 1.2 percent in June to an
average 252,798 pounds ($396,800), property-website operator
Rightmove said. Prices are up 2.7 percent from a year earlier,
the report shows.  The pound traded at $1.5696 as of 7:26 a.m. London time
after climbing to $1.5738 on June 13, the highest since Feb. 11.
Sterling was at 84.94 pence per euro.  The U.K. currency has gained 4.2 percent in the past three
months, the best performer in the Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes, which track 10 developed-market currencies. The dollar
fell 0.1 percent and the euro appreciated 2.1 percent.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 1.3 percent this year
through June 14, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bonds dropped 0.7 percent and Treasuries declined 1
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
