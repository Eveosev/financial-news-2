Twitter Inc., the microblogging
service, is testing a feature for users that will recommend
people to follow on the website via direct messages, said
Michael Sippey, vice president of product.  “If a group of people I follow all follow someone really
quickly, Twitter will push me a direct message,” Sippey said
today at the Bloomberg Next Big Thing Summit in Half Moon Bay,
 California .  Twitter, which has more than 200 million users, is adding
features to expand its membership and keep people on the site
for longer periods of time. Most messages posted on the site are
visible to the public, making it easier for the San Francisco-based company to design new user experiences, Sippey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
