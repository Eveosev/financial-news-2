Brazil  economists raised their
benchmark  interest rate  forecast for this year and next while
lowering 2013 growth expectations, as inflation remains at the
upper limit of the central bank’s target range.  The central bank will raise the Selic to 9 percent this
year and hold it at that level through 2014, compared with the
previous week’s forecast of 8.75 percent, according to a June 14
central bank survey of about 100 analysts published today. It
was the second straight week that economists raised their key
rate forecast for both this year and next. Analysts also cut
their 2013 growth forecast for the fifth straight week, reducing
it to 2.49 percent from 2.53 percent.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration is working to
slow inflation while spurring an economy that has fallen short
of analysts’ forecasts for five straight quarters.  Standard &
Poor’s  cut its Brazil credit rating outlook to negative on June
6, saying sluggish growth threatens public debt levels.
Discontent over price increases has led to a drop in Rousseff’s
popularity, as well as clashes last week between police and
protesters over bus fare increases in several cities including
 Sao Paulo  and  Rio de Janeiro .  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2014, the most
traded in Sao Paulo today, rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 8.81 percent at 9:02 local time. The real
strengthened by 0.2 percent to 2.1482 per  U.S. dollar .  Faster Pace  Consumer prices rose 6.50  in May  from last year, compared
with 6.49 percent in April. Inflation prompted central bankers
to accelerate the pace of benchmark rate increases last month,
by raising the Selic by 50 basis points to 8 percent. Policy
makers target inflation at 4.5 percent plus or minus two
percentage points.  Brazil’s retail sales in April rose at less than half the
pace of economists’ forecasts as inflation curbed purchasing
power.  Latin America ’s largest economy  expanded  0.55 percent in
the first three months of 2013, lower than economists’ forecasts
of a 0.9 increase.  Protesters in Rio and Sao Paulo blocked traffic last week
to oppose a 7 percent rise in public transport fares. The
demonstrations came after Rousseff’s support in June fell to 57
percent from 65 percent in March, according to a Datafolha
survey published on June 9.  Datafolha polled 3,758 people in 180 municipalities on June
6 and 7. The poll had a margin of error of two percentage
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
