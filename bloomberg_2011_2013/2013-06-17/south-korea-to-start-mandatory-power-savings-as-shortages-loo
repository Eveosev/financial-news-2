South Korea  will make heavy users of
electricity cut consumption during peak-demand hours this summer
as it seeks to avert its worst-ever power shortages.  Businesses and institutions that consume more than 5,000
kilowatts per hour, a level reached by 2,631 users, must reduce
their power use by 3 to 15 percent from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. and 2
p.m. to 5 p.m. local time, starting from Aug. 5 through the end
of the month, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said in
an e-mailed statement today. The government will also implement
from tomorrow broader measures to encourage citizens to reduce
usage, including restrictions on office temperatures.  South Korea, the world’s fourth-biggest nuclear power
producer, is struggling to curb power use while the shutdown of
two nuclear reactors reduces electricity supply. Companies
including Samsung Electronics Co. and Hyundai Motor Co. pledged
to adopt power-saving measures to help the country avert
shortages, the energy ministry said earlier this month.  South Korea, which depends on nuclear energy for more than
30 percent of its electricity, halted two nuclear reactors May
28 and delayed the start of operations at another after
discovering that the facilities were using components whose
quality certificates were faked. The country may face
“unprecedented” power shortages during the summer, Vice
Minister for Energy Han Jin Hyun said May 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
