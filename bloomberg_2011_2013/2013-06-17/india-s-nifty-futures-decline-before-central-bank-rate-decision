India’s (SENSEX)  benchmark stock index rose
to a one-week high on speculation the central bank will resume
lowering borrowing costs after holding  interest rates  today.
Automakers led the gains.  The S&P BSE Sensex jumped 0.8 percent to 19,325.87 at the
close in Mumbai. Volume on the gauge was 15 percent below the
30-day average. Tractor maker  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM)  climbed
the most in two weeks after agreeing to buy 13.5 percent of  Cie
Automotive SA (CIE) , a Spanish auto-parts maker. Bajaj Auto Ltd. and
 State Bank of India  advanced to a two-week high.  The  Reserve Bank  of India maintained the repurchase rate
for the first time in four policy reviews and said it would need
proof of a “durable” cooling in prices to lower rates. The
authority pared  borrowing costs  by 25 basis points each in
January, March and May to arrest the worst economic slowdown in
a decade, and last month said the room for rates to decline is
limited by inflation risks.  “The commentary is less hawkish,” Hemant Kanawala, head
of equities at Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Ltd.,
said by phone from Mumbai. “The RBI has said that if inflation
comes down, the scope for rate cuts increases. This is a change
of stance because the commentary earlier was that the scope for
further monetary action is limited.”  The RBI maintained the repurchase rate at 7.25 percent, a
decision predicted by 15 of 25 analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg
News , after a drop in the rupee to a record threatened to fan
prices in a nation that imports about 80 percent of its crude
oil needs. The pace of consumer-price gains has stayed close to
10 percent even as wholesale-price inflation touched a 43-month
low of 4.7 percent in May.  ‘Monetary Action’  Today’s guidance “indicates the RBI is just looking at
inflation as a data point, and if it remains subdued, further
monetary action is a possibility,” Kotak’s Kanawala said.  Mahindra jumped 4.3 percent to 989.35 rupees, its steepest
climb since May 30. The company will pay 96.2 million euros
($128.4 million) for the Cie stock. The Spanish company will own
a majority stake in a single listed entity in India which will
operates all Mahindra’s Systech auto-parts businesses globally
and include Cie’s European forgings operations.  Bajaj Auto rallied 2.5 percent to 1,808.8 rupees.  Maruti
Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL)  rose 1.4 percent to 1,535.25 rupees, adding to
its 4 percent rally of June 14. Motorcycle maker  Hero Motocorp
Ltd. (HMCL)  added 1.3 percent to 1,627.25 rupees.  State Bank of India (SBIN)  increased 1 percent to 2,065.8 rupees.
 Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the biggest mortgage lender,
climbed 1.1 percent to 844.4 rupees.  Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (SUNP) , the nation’s most
valuable drugmaker, surged 2 percent to 972.7 rupees.  Bharti
Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , India’s largest mobile-phone operator, increased
2.3 percent to 296 rupees.  Fed Meeting  U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and the
policy-setting  Federal Open Market Committee  start a two-day
meeting tomorrow. The Sensex has slid 3.7 percent from May 22
after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the authority may taper
stimulus efforts if the world’s largest economy improves.  “The Reserve Bank didn’t deliver anything dramatically
different from what the street was expecting, and the market
will now watch for cues from the Fed,” U.R. Bhat, managing
director of Dalton Capital Advisors India Pvt., a unit of U.K.-
based Dalton Strategic Partnership LLP that has about $2 billion
in assets globally, said by phone from Mumbai.  The Sensex trades at 13.3 times  projected 12-month profits ,
compared with 9.9 times multiple for the MSCI  Emerging Markets 
Index, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  index on the National Stock Exchange of India
Ltd. increased 0.7 percent to 5,850.05. Its June futures settled
at 5,847.75.  India  VIX fell 0.9 percent.  Overseas funds sold a net $95 million of Indian shares on
June 13, a third straight day of withdrawals. That pared this
year’s net purchases to $14.95 billion, still a record for the
period, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
