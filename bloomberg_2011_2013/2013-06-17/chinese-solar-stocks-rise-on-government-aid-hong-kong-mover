GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800)  and
 China Singyes Solar Technologies Holdings Ltd. (750)  rose in  Hong Kong 
trading after the Chinese government said it will help provide
easier financing for solar companies.  GCL-Poly, the biggest maker of polysilicon used in solar
cells, rose 6.6 percent to HK$2.09 at 12:04 local time, the most
since May 21. Singyes, a panel producer and project developer,
jumped as much as 10 percent.  China, the world’s biggest maker of solar panels, also will
move to stimulate domestic demand and encourage mergers and
acquisitions as part of a package of measures announced last
week by the government. China’s solar-panel industry, which
supplies more than half the world market, is unprofitable amid a
global glut and slower economic growth that’s cut demand.  “Promoting domestic demand is positive for solar-product
makers that are suffering from sluggish European market,” Lian Rui, a Beijing-based analyst at research company NPD Solarbuzz,
said by phone today.  The nation may issue new policies on solar power subsidies
as early as this month, the  China  Securities Journal reported
today, citing people it didn’t identify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
