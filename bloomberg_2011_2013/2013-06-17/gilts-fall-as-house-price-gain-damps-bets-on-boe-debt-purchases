U.K.  government bonds  fell for the
first time in four days after an industry report showed home
sellers raised asking prices, weakening the case for additional
central-bank debt purchases to keep borrowing costs low.  The  benchmark 10-year yield  climbed from the lowest level
in a week as economists said a government report tomorrow will
show annual inflation accelerated last month, damping the
attraction of fixed-income securities. Government bonds also
declined as Asian and European stocks advanced.  “There’s various signs around that sentiment is picking up
in the U.K,” said  John Wraith , a fixed-income strategist at
Bank of America Merrill Lynch in  London . “We’re seeing
domestically some of the best numbers that we’ve seen for some
time. I can see why at least part of the move in terms of the
spike higher in yields over the past month has happened.”  The 10-year gilt yield climbed two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.08 percent at 9:32 a.m. London time after
dropping to 2.05 percent on June 14, matching the lowest since
June 7. The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 fell 0.165,
or 1.65 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,571) face amount, to 97.235.
The yield has increased 20 basis points in the past month.  Prices  sought  by British homeowners rose 1.2 percent in
June, pushing average values above 250,000 pounds for the first
time, property-website operator Rightmove said. Annual consumer-price inflation quickened to 2.6 in May from 2.4 percent the
previous month, according to a Bloomberg survey before the
 Office for National Statistics  releases the data tomorrow.  Pound’s Advance  The pound was little changed at $1.5716 after advancing to
$1.5738 on June 13, the strongest since Feb. 11. The U.K.
currency gained 0.1 percent to 84.89 pence per euro.  Sterling has gained 4.4 percent in the past three months,
the best performer of 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro appreciated 2.1
percent and the dollar fell 0.1 percent.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 1.3 percent this year
through June 14, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bonds dropped 0.7 percent and Treasuries declined 1
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
