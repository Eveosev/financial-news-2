Warburg Pincus  LLC, a private-equity
firm that helped find Ghana’s largest oilfield, will invest $600
million in a new exploration venture in Central and East Africa.  Warburg Pincus will be the largest shareholder in Delonex
Energy Ltd., the companies said today in statement. The New
York-based investor previously helped fund  Kosmos Energy (KOS)  Ltd.,
part of a venture that discovered the Jubilee field off Ghana.  “There is significant, underexplored resource potential in
Central and East Africa,” said Delonex Chief Executive Officer
Rahul Dhir, who headed Cairn India Ltd. until August. “Warburg
Pincus is one of the leading investors globally in the energy
sector and has an impressive track record.”  Delonex , based in London, is joining explorers seeking oil
and gas in  East Africa  after  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  and  Eni
SpA (ENI)  found more than 100 trillion cubic feet of gas off the coast
of Mozambique. In West Africa, Ghana became one of the world’s
top 50 oil producers because of output from the Jubilee field.  Delonex said its “key strategic areas” will be the East
African Continental Rift System from the Red Sea, through
Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Mozambique; the Central
African Rift System from Chad to South Sudan; and the coastal
margins of East Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
