THE PROBLEM WITH MUDDY,  medium-brown river water isn't the color, which looks right and true in the Costa Rican jungle, under a canopy of green rustling with howler monkeys and chatty with birds. The problem is that you can't see Saddam Hussein. That's the nickname our guides have for a supposedly twenty-foot-long crocodile they spotted by the river in the months before our trip. In their descriptions and my imaginings, he qualifies as a weapon of mass destruction all by his scaly self. Our guides first mention him in the course of clueing us in on various dangers we should be on the lookout for—strong currents, large rocks, cold-blooded reptiles—and then bring him up a second and even third time before we drag our bright-yellow kayaks into the water. ("Yellow," jokes our lead guide, Marco, "because crocodiles love that color.") We have five hours of paddling ahead of us. Five hours of opportunities for Saddam, lurking unseen beneath the opaque river surface, to swim up and say hello. It's hot and muggy and I have kayaked just twice before in my forty-six years, but all of this is fine. All of this is what I want. Back in New York City, I was shivering through an especially snowy winter that wasn't conducive to the sort of outdoor exercise, like running and biking, that I favor. So I craved a break from the cold and a good long workout. I needed to sweat. The Christmas and New Year's holidays, with their attendant gluttony and indolence, weren't long past; their flabby vestiges lived on. Costa Rica was to be my answer and antidote—a vacation, yes, but one that might help nudge my body and mind back toward some semblance of shape, or at least prevent them from sliding any further than they had. To maximize the chances of that, I signed up for an organized "multisport" tour. Being enfolded in a group and at the mercy of a guide isn't usually my style, but I figure the peer pressure and forced adherence to a set regimen are insurance policies. I can't revert to piña coladas and pulp fiction by the pool. I begin paddling, my hands tightly gripping the middle of one of those long, double-bladed paddles as I plunge one side of it down and back while pulling the other side up and forward, then vice versa, over and over. Fun! Well, not exactly, not after thirty minutes, my shirt soaked from a combination of river water and perspiration, blisters forming where my palms meet my overstressed fingers. I always relish the idea of exercise more than the actual exercise itself, but this is indeed as diverting as a repetitive, shoulder-shredding, back-straining endeavor can be, because instead of staring at a bank of TV screens in the sterile air of an Equinox gym I am looking for—and finding!—egrets and herons and hawks and even vultures, which seems particularly fitting in that our gaggle of eight kayakers, not counting the guides, may well be carrion in the making. And to distract me from my toils I have not only the flora and fauna but also the challenge of adjusting to the frequent sharp bends of the course we are following as my kayak, like the river, snakes. More from  Condé Nast Traveler : We are on the eastern side of Costa Rica, near the Caribbean, on the first full day of a weeklong adventure. And our destination at the end of the five hours on the river is the Mawamba Lodge, where we are scheduled to spend two nights. I've arrived at hotels in unusual manners before: propeller plane, monorail, gondola. But a kayak? That I've powered myself? This is new to me. Every time I focus on it, I can't stop smiling. And I can't stop marveling at what a ruckus the trees make. Costa Rica is to birds what Hollywood is to blonds: a rarefied environment in which a disproportionate number of them cluster, titter, and preen for the cameras. There are nearly as many bird species in tiny Costa Rica (a country smaller than West Virginia) as there are in the continental United States. And to judge from the ones along the river, they are motormouths all, with varied and distinctive voices, some less beguiling than others. I hear a squawker that sounds like Fran Drescher, a whiner in a league with Roseanne Barr, and a brayer that brings to mind Bea Arthur. It isn't a jungle I'm kayaking through; it's a thicket of reruns on TV Land. I press on. Two hours down, three to go. I round another bend, register some movement on the riverbank to the right, and hear one of the guides, Jimmy, yelling. "Watch out!" he warns. Just ahead, two stubby hind legs and the long, thick, sand-colored tail of what is, unmistakably, a crocodile slip from the bank and vanish in the water. I see only the back half of the creature, but from that I can tell the whole of it is perhaps fifteen feet long. Not Saddam. A sibling, perhaps, or quite possibly a surly nephew. "To the left!" Jimmy shouts, imploring us to steer away from the side of the river where we've spotted the beast. We do, and when we reach the area where the croc went under, Jimmy has us pick up our pace so we can minimize our chances of bumping into him. "Fast!" Jimmy insists. "Fast!" He doesn't have to tell me twice. I paddle like an Olympian. My blisters inflate. My heart jackhammers. Sweat pours down me. I wanted a workout. I just didn't think that its intensity and velocity would be determined by the predators in my midst. IN COSTA RICA THERE ARE  not only crocodiles but caimans, which are like toy-size versions of the former, shrunken but still seriously toothed. There are jaguars, too, though they're few in number and rarely seen. You're more likely to stumble upon a poisonous snake—like the fer-de-lance or the bushmaster or the golden eyelash viper—and for this reason we are cautioned never to walk through or near thick vegetation in sandals, with our feet exposed. There are even poisonous frogs, and while simply touching them poses a negligible threat to people, the mere fact of their presence adds to the impression of an Eden whose beauty camouflages treachery. Enter at your own risk. I exaggerate the danger but not the diversity: Costa Rica has few rivals when it comes to zoological bounty per square mile. With its low-altitude wetlands and high-altitude cloud forests, its dual coastlines (Caribbean and Pacific), and its careful stewardship of the environment, the country accommodates all manner of soaring, fluttering, swimming, slithering, hopping, and pouncing creatures. And swinging. Mustn't forget swinging. There are monkeys upon monkeys—howler monkeys and spider monkeys, squirrel monkeys and capuchin monkeys—to the point that a visitor experiences predictable stages of monkey acclimatization. Stage one: Wow! Stage two: They're sort of cute. Stage three: They're sort of noisy. Stage four: Yeah, yeah, another monkey—rouse me when a big hairy gorilla comes along. But what's distinctive about the wildlife isn't just its abundance. It's the scale and subtlety of it—the way it's integrated, often inconspicuously, into the hyper-lush backdrop. On an African safari, the animals are enormous, and they lumber or roar into view, impossible to overlook. You don't mistake an elephant for a bird's nest—which can easily happen with one of Costa Rica's two-toed or three-toed sloths if it's curled tight into a furry ball, as it often is. A lion, unlike a reptile, can't imitate a plant. In Costa Rica you have to concentrate, and the deeper you're willing to delve—by boat, on foot, even by zip-line—the more you have revealed to you. That's the real point and lesson of the kayaking (which is more fatiguing than perilous in the end; crocodiles in these parts aren't known to attack people). Everything about Costa Rica is best appreciated through physical activity. The country gives me the incentive I seek. While the ready-made views from the roadside are sublime, they can't compete with hidden wonders—like the crystalline natural pool at the base of a gentle waterfall deep in the mountains around a flea-speck village (more like a campsite, really) within Los Campesinos Reserve. To reach it, we have to hike for two hours along a narrow, undulating dirt road too rocky and deeply pitted for most vehicles to navigate, all while trying to ignore eighty-five-degree heat and what feels like onehundred- percent humidity. We also have to cross a scary gorge via a terrifying footbridge that jitters and sways with each step. I grip its metal-cable sides so hard that I sprout more blisters. The reward? A brisk swimming hole of our own, with green mountains rising high around it and hawks overhead. Right where the water tumbles into it, the temperature is a good five degrees warmer than anywhere else. The cascade is nature's own Jacuzzi jet. Almost every day we earn our beauty and pleasures, be they pale-blue butterflies, blazing-orange tropical flowers, or cocktails on the pool deck at La Mariposa, a hotel on a bluff above the Pacific with grand 180-degree views of whitecaps and the shoreline stretching dozens of miles south and north. It's the equivalent of a luxury skybox for the sunset, which we watch and toast on all three of the nights we stay there, our appetites for such indulgence primed by the day's exertions. Another of Costa Rica's virtues is that it's easy when you need it to be, just as it's hard when you want that. It has developed a completely modern tourism infrastructure without sacrificing a feeling of remoteness, at least in the off-road areas that we make the effort to get to. It's by turns unspoiled and accessible, thrilling and relaxing in equal measures. Small wonder moviemakers like to come here for wilderness shoots. They can get an uncivilized tableau of vines, cliffs, and darkly shaded creeks, and then a civilized margarita less than an hour's journey away. WHEN I SAY  WE,  I mean four couples from various corners of the United States who didn't know one another but had signed up for the tour, planned by the outdoor outfitter REI . And I mean Marco Fallas, a native Costa Rican about my age who has been escorting visitors through his country and supervising such tours for many years. Although he will recruit different assistants for different activities, he is the only guide with us and is responsible for us day in and day out, morning to night. The sound of his voice is the sound track of our trip. We hear it always. The man can talk. Although diminutive in stature, he is outsize in energy, much of it conversational. When he isn't discussing Costa Rica's animals, he is giving a tutorial on its plants; and when he's done with that, he moves on to its politics, schools, medical system, recycling practices, and even disaster preparedness. Did we know that it has the highest literacy rate in Latin America? (Actually it's the fifth highest.) That it is the envy of its neighbors for the percentage of rural homes with electricity? That its people are, measurably, the Western Hemisphere's happiest? Brazil must have phenomenally gorgeous women, because Marco pronounces Costa Rica's only the second most beautiful in Latin America, and he rarely denies the country preeminence on any front. "I don't have to die to see paradise," he says to us at one point, unbidden and apropos of nothing other than the lavishly mountainous landscape that the van we frequently use is trundling across. "I just have to open my eyes to the beautiful paradise where I live." Nuance isn't his thing. One of us asks if the water at a restaurant is potable. "One hundred ten percent," Marco says. Would sneakers do as well as hiking boots for tomorrow's trek? "One hundred ten percent," he says. And on that trek, would we be seeing monkeys? "One hundred ten percent," he says, in this instance perhaps underplaying his hand. I'd have said 150 percent, and done so with an eye roll by day six. If loquaciousness is his signal characteristic, a kind of X-ray vision isn't far behind. He has a talent that we notice in a few other guides who cross our path: From hundreds of feet away, through a gauntlet of dense brush, he can sense and single out a worthwhile wildlife specimen. We might be paddling, hiking, or just driving around in the van when he would call an abrupt halt to our progress, point to a seemingly unremarkable clump of trees or bushes, set up his tripod telescope, and tell us to look through the lens. And there, abracadabra, perfectly framed, would be a toucan with bands and patches of pale green, deep red, bright yellow: an entire sherbet assortment or, yes, box of Froot Loops on wings. Or maybe a roadside hawk— that's the full name of the species, often encountered, felicitously, by the side of the road—against a backdrop of broad, aged palm trees with ferns clustered like leg warmers around the base of their thick trunks. These hawks have ornately tufted breasts with the barest suggestion of pink beneath brown and white feathers, and their tiny heads twitch this way and that, responding to cues only they register and understand. Perhaps most surprising is the so-called Jesus Christ lizard, more correctly known as the common basilisk but given its fanciful nickname on account of its ability, for short periods of time, to run on its hind legs across the surface of the water. We come upon one in Tortuguero National Park, a tropical wet forest around Mawamba, on the morning after we kayaked in. A tropical wet forest gets even more precipitation than a run-of-the-mill tropical forest, which gets plenty already. In the case of Tortuguero, that means about 230 inches annually. (New York City, by comparison, gets about 50 inches; Miami, about 60.) We see (and feel) firsthand what that volume of water means, because almost the moment we park our kayaks upon arrival at the lodge, the heavens open up, and for the next thirty-six hours, they never close. What falls from them is less a downpour than a pelting—violent, ceaseless, surreal. Incredibly, February, when we are there, is one of Tortuguero's driest months. Still we venture out, all of us, though clumped together in one long boat with an outboard motor. Marco sits in front. Another guide operates the motor in the back, and a third guide, in between them, does nothing more than bail rainwater from the vessel so it doesn't fill and sink. If the point of adventure travel is to see nature as it really is, then we are following the script, experiencing one of the world's wettest ecosystems on its own soggy terms. My poncho—water-resistant, I quickly learn, not waterproof—is plastered to my skin. Its drenched hood doesn't so much protect my head as mummify it. I've visited patches of the Florida Everglades and swaths of swampy southern Louisiana, and they prepared me somewhat for Tortuguero, where both narrow and broad channels cut through tangles of reeds and clusters of tropical foliage. But in Tortuguero the plant life has a Jurassic heft and overripe vividness all its own, and it presses tight against the edges of the canals and rivers, so that land and water don't so much meet as melt into each other. The Jesus Christ lizard is concealed by a profusion of gargantuan ferns and philodendrons that sprawl across the jungle floor. I don't know how in the world Marco saw it. But suddenly the boat slows, then stops, and he has his binoculars out—he doesn't dare expose his telescope to this deluge. He extends them to me and patiently helps me point them in the right direction so that the lizard is in the center of my field of vision. It isn't walking on water but lazing on a tree limb, in a pose that makes clear that the fanciful spikes on its back aren't mere ostentatious ornament but adaptive genius. They are dead ringers for little leaves, just as the main part of the lizard's body mimics a branch. I come to think of Costa Rica as a living, breathing, adult version of that page in the children's magazine Highlightswhich challenges you to find the frying pan and hubcap hidden in the forest. Here we are looking for iguanas and hummingbirds, and without Marco, we'd be plumb out of luck. TO REACH THE AREA  around La Mariposa, which lies between the small, scruffy beach town of Quepos and the oceanfront verdure of Manuel Antonio National Park, we fly in planes so small that the eight of us and Marco have to break into two groups: four in one aircraft, five in the other. These carry us over the spine of mountainous peaks, many volcanic, that run the length of the country north to south. The tiny planes inspire little confidence when turbulence hits. For the middle ten minutes of the thirty-five-minute flight, my plane rattles, bucks, dips, and swerves—an amusement park ride without the amusement. Going through this so soon after the liquid onslaught of Tortuguero, I feel like the subject of some cruel cosmic inquiry into how much a city slicker can endure. That feeling isn't alleviated by what we do less than ninety minutes after landing. We go zip-lining. Marco and several helpers strap us into harnesses, attach us to slanted cables, and send us careening through the trees, eye level with sloths, one of which we see. It isn't the first and won't be the last. I count eight sloth sightings during the week, enough to give me the requisite familiarity with sloths and confidence to declare: They have the life. They stay above the fray, high in their trees, and don't budge much. Is it because some of the leaves they eat have an alkaloid content to rival marijuana's? Could what we've often attributed to laziness really be a matter of these inert, slothful fur balls being stoned out of their minds? When I see one actually commute all the way from one tree branch to another, I nearly keel over. For a sloth, those nine inches are the equivalent of a decathlon. We move more often and, I like to think, more momentously, using La Mariposa as a base for exploration of Manuel Antonio, immediately to the south, and, to the northeast, the majestic Talamanca Mountains around the Savegre River. Manuel Antonio is something of a disappointment, an example of Costa Rica being a bit too accessible. We walk stretches of trail that are paved or have cinder block steps, and we pass scores of other tourists. But Manuel Antonio has spectacular crescentshaped white sand beaches, and because you have to walk maybe half a mile from the nearest road to get to them, they're often uncrowded and peaceful. The water is turquoise and pristine. But if you swim too long and leave your belongings unattended, white-faced capuchins may well descend from the trees to plunder them, and if you look from the beach into the jungle at the right moment, you may see a Central American agouti scamper past. The agouti—we spot two—looks sort of like a rat blown up to three times its usual size. "They say the meat tastes like lobster," Marco volunteers. Is there anything about Costa Rica he can't spin in a savory fashion? For him its wilderness is larder, spice cabinet, apothecary. On an unpaved trail into the Talamanca Mountains, which we reach via a ninety-minute drive from La Mariposa, he keeps picking at bushes, plucking at trees, and rubbing leaves, buds, pods, and such into our hands. "Smell that," he tells me. Cinnamon. "And that," he says. Vanilla. There is a plant with the mentholated perfume of Bengay, and he says that it is indeed used as a balm for aches. He also points out a pale-green, dark-speckled fruit that he says is richer in antioxidants than pomegranate or acai, and thought to be more healthful. He says it is called noni or morinda. But the Costa Ricans interested in marketing it, he notes, have a problem, which becomes evident later when a farmer whose mountaintop house we hike to gives us sips of nonijuice. Although it has a thin, throwaway flavor, it smells repellently of stinky cheese. In fact, one of its two common nicknames is cheese fruit. The other: vomit fruit. From the farmer's house we have commanding vistas. To maximize them, we climb steps to a raised wood platform he has built on his highest point of land. I am maybe sixth in line—and am only halfway up the steps when Diane, a young physician from Boston who is at the head of our group, comes running back down. "Ants!" she warns as she flicks a few of them, biters all, off her bare ankles. I bolt, on the lam from predators once again. The farmer serves us water from a coconut that he has just cracked open with a knife. After about three hours of hiking and such a dramatic finale, it's as refreshing as any drink I've ever had, better even than the white wine I pair with the Mariposa sunset that night. THE SORENESS  creeps up on me, but I can feel it in my thighs and lower back when we return to the mountains the next day, this time going higher up the Savegre so that we can roar down and over its rapids in four-person rafts. Because our group has expanded to include an additional twenty people from the tours that happen to be rafting on the Savegre that same day, a bus takes us there—an old school bus whose shock absorbers seem to be a thing of the distant past. The engine's horsepower isn't very impressive, either. When we reach one especially sharp rise in the rocky dirt road, eight of the passengers have to get out and move into a van traveling just ahead to lighten the bus's load. Even so, the driver can't tackle the incline head-on. Instead, he slaloms from left to right and right to left as a way of lessening the grade. It prolongs the bumpy journey, during which I can feel, in my seat, even the tiniest pebbles under our wheels. Rafting means more paddling, gently when the river is calm, furiously when we hit rapids and have to thread the raft between the biggest boulders in our path. We work up sweats, and every forty-five minutes, to cool down, we dive overboard and swim for five minutes or so. This river water, unlike Tortuguero's, is translucent, and if it harbors any dangers, no one has mentioned them. As I float on my back, ears below the surface, the world falls almost completely silent, and I look up at near walls of craggy stone, and the slopes of green beyond them, and the even taller slopes of green beyond those. Scattered clouds mosey across a powder-blue sky. Picking my head up, I hear an awesome, all-encompassing whirring, produced by unseen cicadas in the brush. A tiger-striped heron glides by, its long neck extended, wings spread wide. I am onto a Costa Rican truth: Paddle and ye shall know the fruits. The next day, our last, we tuck ourselves into one of those long outrigger canoes—all eight of us—and muscle our way through the rougher waters of the Pacific in order to get around a rocky outcropping and into a bay of sorts, where an especially lovely beach, Punta Leona, awaits. The beach can be reached in easier ways, but easy isn't our agenda. I pull my wide-brimmed hat low and wrap a bandanna around my neck, for protection from the fierce sun. About an hour after we set out, we're pulling our outrigger onto the sand. Just minutes after that, we see two scarlet macaws putting on a show above the palms. They circle each other, perform tandem arabesques. At the beginning of the trip, Marco insisted that we make a wish list of wildlife, and over the ensuing days, item after item has been crossed off. Only two remain: boa constrictor and scarlet macaw. The former was put on the list by my group mates, not me, and I have no interest in encountering it. The latter I've pretty much forgotten about, but now there are two before me, and they're sensational with their red and blue and yellow feathers, a pair of parrots from central casting. It's as if they've deliberately saved themselves for the end, fashioning themselves as proper payoffs for the blisters, bumps, cramps, and ants along the way. With dusk approaching, we head back to San José in the van. Marco gets in some final plugs for his beloved country, extolling its military, farmers, and coffee—especially coffee, of which, I suspect, he's consumed a great deal. We have just one stop to make, on a busy two-lane bridge famous throughout the country for what tends to congregate in the shallow waters about seventy-five feet below: crocodiles. We climb out of the van, peer over the side of the bridge, and behold not just two or three crocodiles but more than a dozen, moving slowly or not at all—almost every one of them visible in its entirety, from menacing snout to fearsome tail. Amazing. And yet. There is something deflating about having them served up this readily, to a populous audience of motorists who have done nothing more arduous than hit the brakes. On the far side of the bridge stands a Los Cocodrilos restaurant, a Los Cocodrilos bar, a Los Cocodrilos souvenir shop. The noise of cars, not cicadas, fills the air. I saw only part of Saddam's nephew, and there wasn't any sign of the rest of the clan. But that was the more electric encounter, the one that quickened my pulse and yanked me further outside my comfort zone, which was just where I needed to be. More from  Condé Nast Traveler :
