Tim Connelly was named vice
president of basketball operations for the  Denver Nuggets ,
joining the National Basketball Association franchise after
three seasons as assistant general manager for the New Orleans
Pelicans.  Connelly, 36, was hired to replace Masai Ujiri, who left
Denver this month to join the Toronto Raptors, the Nuggets
 announced  on their website.  Prior to working with the Pelicans, who changed their name
from the Hornets after their 2012-13 season, Connelly spent a
decade with the  Washington Wizards , rising to director of player
personnel.  The Nuggets have yet to announce a coach to replace George Karl, who was fired June 6 after winning the NBA’s Coach of the
Year award. Denver went 57-25 this season, falling to the Golden
State Warriors in the first round of the playoffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
