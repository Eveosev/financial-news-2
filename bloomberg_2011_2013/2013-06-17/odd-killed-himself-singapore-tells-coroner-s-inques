U.S. research engineer Shane Todd
died from hanging himself,  Singapore ’s state counsel said in
closing submissions to a coroner’s inquest today, disputing
claims by his family that he was murdered.  The murder “theory is entirely misplaced and unfounded,”
Senior State Counsel Tai Wei Shyong said at the inquest at a
Singapore subordinate court. “Shane’s death was a suicide.”  Singapore opened the inquiry after the Todd family
disagreed with a police report that Todd committed suicide.
Todd, 31 when he died in June 2012, may have been killed because
of his sensitive work at Singapore’s Institute of
Microelectronics, his family had said.  There was no evidence of any foul play, possible suspect or
credible motive for murder, Tai said. Neither was there evidence
from Todd’s parents or others that he made efforts to protect
his safety after indicating to his family that his life was in
danger, the Singapore government lawyer said.  The family quit the inquest May 22 after walking out of the
courtroom a day earlier. Edward Adelstein, a medical examiner
engaged by the family had testified Todd may have been shot by a
taser gun or killed in an arm-lock after earlier saying he may
have been strangled to death based on pictures of the body.  Coroner Chay Yuen Fatt is scheduled to deliver his verdict
on July 8.  The Coroner’s Inquiry is Shane Truman Todd. CI002014 of
2012. Singapore Subordinate Courts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
