Wine grapes in the Vouvray region of
 France ’s Loire Valley were damaged by overnight hailstorms, with
two-thirds of vineyards “very strongly affected,” the
 Agriculture Ministry  reported.  Damage covered 200 hectares (494 acres) out of 800 hectares
in the village of Cravant-les-Coteaux in the neighboring  Chinon 
region, while grapes were also harmed in the Bourgueil and St.
Nicolas de Bourgueil denominations, the ministry wrote in an e-mailed statement today.  Grape-harvest losses are insurable and not covered under
agricultural-disaster regulation, the ministry said. Agriculture
Minister Stephane Le Foll has asked for dispensation of
property-tax payments on plots affected by hail, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
