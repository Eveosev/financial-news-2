Etihad Airways PJSC, the third-biggest Gulf airline, signed a memorandum of understanding with
the Serbian government that would lead to a possible tie-up with
unprofitable JAT Airways AD.  “These are early days, we are excited about the future, we
look forward to exploring possibility of a much deeper strategic
commercial partnership with JAT Airways,” said Etihad Chief
Executive Officer James Hogan at a news conference in Belgrade
today. A detailed proposal is expected in the coming weeks.  The Abu Dhabi-based Etihad began regular daily flights to
Belgrade on June 15 and attached its code to 23 of JAT’s
European flights, with the Serbian company doing likewise on 21
Etihad services.  Serbia has been trying to find a strategic partner for the
money-losing air carrier for years. Prime Minister Ivica Dacic’s
Cabinet said in March it would take over 170 million euros ($220
million) in liabilities. A strategic partner will help JAT renew
its fleet.  The Belgrade-based airline’s loss widened to 3.68 billion
dinars ($43.2 million) in 2012 from 3.33 billion dinars in 2011,
according to its financial results posted on the Serbian
Business Registers Agency’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
