ABP (China) Holdings Group Ltd. , the
Chinese developer that announced a 1 billion-pound ($1.6
billion)  London  business center last month, said the project
would be valued at more than twice what it will cost to build.  “The demand is huge,” ABP Chairman Weiping Xu told
reporters at a briefing today in the U.K. embassy in Beijing.
That’s prompted the company to raise the target for the first
phase of the project to as many as 100 buildings from about 60,
he said.  ABP signed an agreement with London officials last month to
transform the 35-acre (14-hectare) site at Royal Albert Dock
near London City Airport into the capital’s third business
district after the  City of London  and  Canary Wharf . The project
will target Asian businesses, particularly financial-services
companies.  Most of the Chinese companies with operations in Britain
rent space and can’t find desirable offices to buy, “let alone
an opportunity to gather, share resources and interact,” Xu
said.  More than 10 investment banks and private-equity firms have
approached ABP to offer funding since the announcement, Xu said.
At least 56 businesses have expressed an interest in buying a
building, bolstering confidence the project can be completed
within about 12 years after construction starts next year.  The project will be built in five phases with plans for
about 300 office buildings by the time it’s done, according to
Tongbo Liu, ABP’s general manager for overseas affairs. The
Beijing-based company plans to rent out as much as 40 percent of
the space and sell the rest as whole buildings, Xu said.  Construction Costs  The building costs of the 400,000 square meter (4.3 million
square foot) project will be about 800 million pounds, an
average of about 20,000  yuan  ($3,265) per square meter, Xu said.
The remaining 200 million pounds of investment would cover
management fees and personnel costs, he added.  The project will be worth at least 40,000 yuan to 50,000
yuan a square meter after completion, Xu said.  About 30 percent of the 1 billion-pound investment will
come from ABP, which is 95 percent owned by Xu, he said. Another
30 percent to 40 percent of the funding will be raised from
other investors, while the rest will be financed by sale
proceeds of the project, Xu said.  --Zhang Dingmin. Editors: Jeff St.Onge,  Andrew Blackman .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
