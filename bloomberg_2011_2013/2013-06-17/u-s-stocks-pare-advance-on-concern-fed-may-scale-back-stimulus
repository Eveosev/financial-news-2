U.S. stocks pared gains amid concern
the  Federal Reserve  may signal it will scale back monetary
stimulus at the conclusion of its next policy meeting.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index rose 0.6 percent to
1,636.14 at 2:32 p.m. in New York, paring an earlier rally of as
much as 1.2 percent.  Stocks trimmed their advance as a British official said the
Group of Eight leaders see downside risks to the global economy
abating even as growth prospects remain weak. Equities also
pared gains after the Financial Times reported that Fed Chairman
Ben Bernanke is likely to signal the central bank is close to
tapering its $85 billion in asset purchases at the conclusion of
a policy meeting June 19.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
