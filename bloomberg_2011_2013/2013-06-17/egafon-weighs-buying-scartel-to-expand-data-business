OAO MegaFon (MFON) , Russia’s second-largest
wireless carrier, is considering buying smaller operator Scartel
to expand its network as mobile Internet use increases, Chief
Executive Officer Ivan Tavrin said.  “Scartel is a very interesting asset,” Tavrin, 36, said
in a phone interview from Moscow. “We do not exclude the
possibility of an acquisition in the future but, obviously,
depending on its terms.”  The deal would help Moscow-based  MegaFon  increase its lead
in Russia’s fast-growing wireless-data market over  OAO Mobile
TeleSystems (MBT)  and  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  MegaFon, seeking to expand after
an initial public offering in London in November, would get
mobile spectrum and a network using faster long-term evolution
technology.  An acquisition would also mark an internal shuffle of
assets by billionaire  Alisher Usmanov , whose USM Holdings Ltd.
controls just more than 50 percent of MegaFon and 82 percent of
Scartel. He is seeking an edge over fellow billionaires Vladimir
Evtushenkov, who controls OAO Mobile TeleSystems, and  Mikhail
Fridman , who controls VimpelCom Ltd.  Though Scartel holds more LTE spectrum than rivals, it is
difficult to estimate Scartel’s value because the closely held
company hasn’t disclosed many details about its network or
subscriber numbers, said  Anna Lepetukhina , a Sberbank Investment
Research analyst in Moscow. Usmanov bought Scartel, which
operates under the Yota brand, in a deal that valued it at $1
billion last year, the Vedomosti newspaper reported at the time.  ‘Logical’ Move  “It’s logical for MegaFon to acquire Scartel, still it’s
hard to estimate the fair price for such a deal,” Lepetukhina
said. “Scartel is a black box, all we know is that it has 60
megahertz of LTE frequencies.”  Usmanov’s USM believes a Scartel takeover by MegaFon would
“make sense” and lead to “synergies” in developing faster
data services using LTE technology, Ivan Streshinsky, head of
the investment firm, said in an interview. MegaFon already
offers LTE service on Scartel’s network through a partnership.  USM bought Moscow-based Scartel last year for an
undisclosed sum and is willing to sell it to MegaFon for the
same price to avoid any conflicts of interest, Streshinsky said.  Such a large acquisition would have to be approved by
MegaFon’s owners, and since Usmanov’s USM is a holder in both
the acquirer and the seller it might be excluded from the final
decision-making by Russian rules, Lepetukhina said. That means
the deal would have to be approved by Sweden’s  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) ,
which owns about a quarter of MegaFon.  Salomon Bekele, a TeliaSonera spokesman in  Stockholm ,
declined to comment on a possible Scartel deal.  Lucrative Customers  Scartel would help MegaFon as Tavrin tries to reach 1
million LTE customers by the end of 2013. The company is vying
for lucrative data users as most Russians already have mobile
phones and voice revenue slows. Average revenue per LTE user is
“substantially” higher than for other customers, Tavrin said.  The relationship with Scartel helped MegaFon start LTE
services ahead of competitors and reach 150,000 subscribers,
Tavrin said. Scartel’s network covers 100 Russian cities, while
its financials aren’t publicly disclosed, said Streshinsky, 43.  MegaFon is seeking to sustain growth after boosting its
 share price  more than 50 percent since the November IPO. The
stock rose 1.4 percent to $32.36 at 1:44 p.m. in London.  Soaring Market  Russia ’s wireless market grew 9 percent last year to more
than $26 billion, while data revenue surged 33 percent to $3.2
billion, almost doubling since 2010, according to AC&M
Consulting. Older 3G technology generates the majority of data
revenue, and LTE so far accounts for “just a tiny percentage,”
Anton Pogrebinsky, an AC&M analyst in Moscow, said by phone.  USM’s idea previously was to build Scartel into an
infrastructure company operating a network on which all Russia’s
largest carriers would offer service. Scartel insisted that
operators using its network should guarantee certain volumes of
business, which would allow the company to fund costs of network
development, which already exceeds $450 million, according to
USM’s Streshinsky.  Still, MTS and VimpelCom failed to agree on the terms with
Scartel. MTS decided to develop LTE on its own as cooperation
terms offered by Scartel weren’t economically attractive, said
Irina Agarkova, a company spokeswoman. VimpelCom hasn’t yet
agreed with Scartel and doesn’t view LTE as a priority for 2013,
said Anna Aybasheva, a spokeswoman for VimpelCom.  ‘The Future’  “Other operators are not interested in developing LTE as
there are not enough end-user devices supporting this
technology, while they haven’t yet fully exhausted the potential
of 3G for data services,” Streshinsky said. “On the contrary,
we as MegaFon and Scartel shareholders made a bet on LTE and see
it’s the future.”  To further increase its stakes in the Russian wireless
market, USM may be willing to buy TeliaSonera’s stake in
MegaFon, which is worth about $5 billion, Streshinsky said. USM
has a good relationship with TeliaSonera and understands that
the Scandinavian company may find it difficult to sell MegaFon’s
shares in the market due to restrictions on  London  trading and
the illiquidity of the Russian stock market, he said.  TeliaSonera Chairman Marie Ehrling said in an interview
today that the carrier’s stake in MegaFon is a “long-term
holding,” declining to elaborate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
