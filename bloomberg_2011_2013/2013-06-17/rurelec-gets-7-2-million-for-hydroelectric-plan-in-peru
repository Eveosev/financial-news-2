Rurelec Plc, a U.K. power company
that operates plants in  Latin America , will receive $7.2 million
from the Inter-American Investment Corp. for a hydroelectric
project in Peru.  The Canchayllo project has now been fully financed and is
at an “advanced stage of construction” on the Pachacayo River
in Peru’s central province of Junin, Rurelec said today in a
 statement . It is owned by Cascade Hydro Ltd., a Peruvian power
generation company in which Rurelec has a 70 percent stake.  The 5.3-megawatt project is expected to start producing
energy in the first quarter, according to the statement. The
Inter-American Investment Corp. is a unit of Washington-based
Inter-American Development Bank. Rurelec is based in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
