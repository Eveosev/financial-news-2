The  San Antonio Spurs  are one win
away from a fifth National Basketball Association title after a
114-104 victory against the defending-champion Miami Heat.  Manu Ginobili  made his first start for the Spurs this
season and contributed 24 points, 10 assists and a spark for  San
Antonio ’s offense last night at the AT&T Center.  Danny Green hit six three-pointers to set a NBA Finals
record with 25 in the series,  Tony Parker  had 26 points and  Tim Duncan  added 17 points and 12 rebounds to help the Spurs grab a
three-games-to-two lead in the best-of-seven NBA Finals. The
series returns to Miami for Game 6 tomorrow.  “We all knew how important this game was and we needed a
win,” Ginobili said. “We couldn’t go to Miami needing both
games. So a great opportunity now, one win away.”  The Heat won Games 2 and 4 after falling behind 1-0 and 2-1
in the series and need another victory to force a decisive
seventh game on June 20 in Miami.  The Heat last lost back-to-back games on Jan. 8 and 10, yet
Miami also hasn’t won consecutive playoff games since its
second-round series against the  Chicago Bulls .  LeBron James  and  Dwyane Wade  each scored 25 points last
night for the Heat, while  Ray Allen  had 21 points off the bench.  After a 16-point home loss in Game 4, the Spurs jumped out
to an early lead and then withstood several runs by the Heat.  San Antonio closed the first quarter with a 15-2 scoring
run to break open a 17-17 tie and open a 32-19 lead it wouldn’t
relinquish. Each time Miami rallied, the Spurs answered.  One-Point Deficits  When the Heat pulled within 61-60 with 10:42 remaining in
the third quarter, the Spurs responded with seven straight
points, including a three-pointer by Green, who broke Allen’s
record of 22 three-pointers in an NBA Finals series.  After the Heat again cut the deficit to one point, at
75-74, the Spurs closed the third quarter with a 12-1 run fueled
by seven points from Ginobili, who became the first player to
start in the NBA Finals after not starting a game all season
since Marcus Camby for the  New York  Knicks in 1999.  “We tried to really push the pace,” Ginobili said.  San Antonio, which made 60 percent of its shots, also
scored the first seven points of the fourth quarter and extended
its advantage to as many 20 points.  “Once we got it back to one and felt we weathered the
storm, we missed a couple shots we’re accustomed to making and
it snowballed down the hill from there,” Heat coach  Erik Spoelstra  said at his post-game news conference. “We just
didn’t show the mental resolve we needed to.”  The Heat got within 109-100 with 2:01 left before Parker
hit a driving layup and Green nailed another three-pointer to
finish with 24 points.  Since the Spurs won Game 1 of the series 92-88, the past
four games have been decided by an average of 20.3 points.  San Antonio’s last title came after the 2006-07 season,
while the Spurs also won championships in 1999, 2003 and 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
