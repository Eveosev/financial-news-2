Liberty Mutual Holding Co., the
third-largest seller of property-casualty coverage in the U.S.,
hired Colin Dowling to lead its public affairs office in
 Washington  as policy makers weigh capital standards and laws on
terrorism protection.  Dowling joins from  Citigroup Inc. (C)  where he was a managing
director, running state and local government-affairs programs,
according to a Business Wire statement today from Boston-based
Liberty Mutual.  U.S. and international lawmakers are scrutinizing the
balance sheets of the largest financial companies as they seek
to avoid a repeat of the 2008 rescues required to prop up banks
and insurers such as American International Group Inc.
Policyholder-owned Liberty Mutual, which didn’t take a bailout
from the U.S. Treasury Department, said its government-relations
group is also evaluating possible changes in laws about taxes,
trade and terrorism.  “At a time of increasing convergence of state, federal and
international policy initiatives, Colin’s broad experience at
both the state and federal levels and across the insurance and
banking sectors, makes him an ideal person” to run the
Washington office, Paul Mattera, the insurer’s chief public
affairs officer, said in the statement.  Mark Costiglio, a spokesman for New York-based Citigroup,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
