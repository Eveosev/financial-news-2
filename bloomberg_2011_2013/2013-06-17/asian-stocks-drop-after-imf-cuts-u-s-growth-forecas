have to be stock-specific across whether its China, Asean or

volatility we’ve seen,” said Chris Green, Auckland-based

management company. “It’s likely to stick to the September time
frame for withdrawing some stimulus, but if there’s any
indication that the Fed will withdraw stimulus sooner than
expected, then we will see a big reaction.”  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or
