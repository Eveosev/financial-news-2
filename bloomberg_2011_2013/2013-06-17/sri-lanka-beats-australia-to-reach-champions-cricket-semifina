Sri Lanka  beat Australia by 20 runs
to advance to an International Cricket Council Champions Trophy
semifinal against India in two days.  Set 254 runs to win at the Oval in London yesterday,
Australia needed to chase down the target in 29.1 overs in order
qualify for the semifinals on net run rate ahead of New Zealand,
which also was ousted by Sri Lanka’s victory. After failing to
reach that target, the Australians were bowled out for 233 in
42.3 overs in the 50-over match.  Sri Lanka’s win ended Australia’s bid for a third straight
title at the eight-nation tournament. The Australians will now
prepare for a five-Test Ashes series against  England  beginning
July 10.  Mahela Jayawardene’s unbeaten 84 and Lahiru Thirimanne’s 57
helped lift Sri Lanka to 253-8 yesterday after it was sent in to
bat by Australia stand-in captain George Bailey.  None of the Australian batsmen got past 50 in the run chase
as Adam Voges top scored with 49 off 62 balls. Nuwan Kulasekara
led Sri Lanka’s bowlers with three wickets for 42 runs.  England faces  South Africa  tomorrow in the first semifinal
at the Oval in London, while Sri Lanka takes on India in
Cardiff, Wales, the following day. The final is scheduled June
23 in Birmingham.  To contact the reporter on this story:
