Pinnacle Entertainment Inc. (PNK) , the
operator of seven casinos and a racetrack, said it reached a
tentative agreement with the Federal Trade Commission to
complete its acquisition of  Ameristar Casinos Inc. (ASCA)   The FTC filed a complaint in May to block the proposed
$2.8 billion takeover, saying it would hurt competition and
cause lower gambling payouts.  “We are pleased with the progress we have made in
addressing the Federal Trade Commission’s administrative
complaint and look forward to completing our proposed
acquisition of Ameristar as soon as possible in the third
quarter,” Anthony Sanfilippo, chief executive officer of
Pinnacle Entertainment, said in a statement today.  Pinnacle said it plans to sell an Ameristar casino project
in  Lake Charles , Louisiana, and the Lumiere Place Casino,
HoteLumiere and Four Seasons Hotel in St. Louis, subject to
regulatory approvals, according to the statement.  Both companies are based in Las Vegas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
