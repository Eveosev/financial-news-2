Qatar Airways Ltd. may become a
launch customer for the  Boeing Co. (BA)  777-9X while eschewing a
smaller version in favor of a plane from Airbus SAS.  “I am more interested in the -9 for one very simply reason
and that is that it will perform better than what they say,”
Akbar Al Baker, chief executive officer of the Doha-based
carrier said. Boeing still needs to provide more information
before Qatar will sign on, he said.  Airbus and Boeing are battling for widebody supremacy at
the 50th  Paris Air Show , with Qatar Air disclosing two firm
orders for Boeing 777-300ERs and options for seven more to
assure growth until new planes are ready. The airline, the lead
customer for the Airbus A350, said it will use the largest
version, the -1000, rather than opting for the new Boeing 777-8X
which is the closest competitors.  “There could be airlines like Emirates that have a need
for the 777-8X because they have ultra, ultra-long flights,”  Al
Baker  said. “But with my network requirement I don’t think I
need the -8.”  Al Baker said he’s also not interested in the Boeing 787-10X as other planes he’s committed to buy fill that need.
Nevertheless, the airline is in talks with Boeing to exercise
options for 30 more smaller 787 Dreamliners beyond 30 ordered
contingent on timing, he said.  “We have already asked Boeing to give us slots,” he said.
“If they give us slots in the next decade we will not be
interested because by then there are other products that are
available.”  The carrier may also buy additional Airbus A330 passenger
planes, beyond 26 ordered, at an appropriate price. “With the
introduction of the A350 the airplane becomes a little bit
vintage,” he said.  Qatar may also buy or lease freighters and abandon a plan
to convert A330 passenger models to cargo carriers unless the
European Aeronautics, Defence & Space Co. unit due to perform
the work lowers its price, Al Baker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
