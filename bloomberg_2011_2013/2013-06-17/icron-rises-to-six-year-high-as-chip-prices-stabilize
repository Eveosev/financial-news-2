  Micron Technology Inc. (MU) , the largest
U.S. maker of memory chips, climbed to the highest price in
almost six years after analysts at Jefferies & Co. and Credit
Suisse AG raised their price estimates on the stock.  The shares advanced 3.8 percent to $13.24 in New York, the
highest closing price since July 2007. The stock has jumped 109
percent this year, compared with a 23 percent gain for the
Philadephia Semiconductor Index.  Market prices for memory chips, which store information in
computers and mobile devices, will remain at current levels or
increase as manufacturers such as Micron,  Samsung Electronics
Co. (005930)  and  SK Hynix Inc. (000660)  have kept production increases in check,
Sundeep Bajikar, an analyst at Jefferies, wrote in a research
report. He raised his target price for the stock to $18 from
$15, while John Pitzer, an analyst at Credit Suisse, boosted the
estimate to $20 from $14.  “As memory prices become more predictable, we expect
valuation to move higher,” Bajikar wrote in a research report.  A shortage of chips for mobile devices and efforts by  Intel
Corp . and Microsoft Corp. to counter a slump in personal
computers by enabling lower-cost notebooks should bolster
revenue for Micron, Bajikar said.  Micron, based in Boise, Idaho, makes dynamic random access
memory, or DRAM, which provides the main memory in PCs. It also
makes Nand  flash memory , chips that provide the storage in
mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.  The company is scheduled to report earnings for the fiscal
third quarter on June 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
