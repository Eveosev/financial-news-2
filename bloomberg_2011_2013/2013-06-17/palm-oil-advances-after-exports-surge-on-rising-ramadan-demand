Palm oil  gained for a second day on
speculation that exports from  Malaysia  will climb this month as
importers stockpile to meet an increase in demand during the
Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.  The contract for August delivery, with the biggest open
interest, climbed as much as 0.8 percent to 2,458 ringgit ($785)
a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives and ended the
morning session at 2,448 ringgit. Futures fell 0.7 percent last
week, the first such loss since the five days ended May 3. Palm
for local  physical  delivery in July was at 2,430 ringgit on June
14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Malaysia, the second-largest producer after  Indonesia , left
the tax on crude palm oil exports unchanged at 4.5 percent for a
fifth month in July to boost shipments. Exports jumped 18
percent to 709,860 tons in the first 15 days of this month,
surveyor Intertek said on June 15. Demand typically picks up
ahead of Ramadan, which falls in July this year, when Muslims
break day-long fasts with communal meals.  “Demand is continuously there, mainly for Ramadan,”
Rajesh Modi, a trader at Sprint Exim Pte., said by phone from
Singapore. “Suppose the market goes higher, then demand may
slow down. Buyers may switch to soybean because soybean is
coming down and palm oil is going up.”  Soybean oil ’s  premium  over palm oil was at $264.97 a ton
today compared with an average of $319 this year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The two edible oils are substitutes
in food and fuel uses.  Soybean oil for December delivery fell 0.3 percent to 47.50
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans for
delivery in November declined 1 percent to $12.8575 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for January delivery climbed 0.7 percent
to 6,264  yuan  ($1,023) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange ,
while soybean oil for delivery in the same month rose 0.3
percent to 7,630 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
