Brazil ’s swap rates climbed to a
one-year high after central bank president Alexandre Tombini
said there is no limit to increases in borrowing costs as policy
makers strive to curb inflation.  Swap rates on the contract due in January rose five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 8.80 percent at 10:43 a.m
in Sao Paulo, the highest level on a closing basis since April
2012. The real depreciated less than 0.1 percent to 2.1518 per
dollar after dropping 0.9 percent last week.  “After Tombini’s comments, the market is pricing in more
increases to the benchmark rate,” Mauricio Junqueira, who
oversees 700 million reais at Tese Gestao de Investimentos, said
in a telephone interview from  Rio de Janeiro . “It seems the
central bank wants to win back the market’s confidence and show
that it is serious about containing inflation.”  Swap rates rose as Tombini said in an interview with  Valor
Economico  published June 14 that he doesn’t see a break in the
fight against inflation. The central bank confirmed the
interview. Policy makers will raise the target lending rate to 9
percent this year, compared with the previous week’s projection
of 8.75 percent, according to the median forecast of about 100
analysts surveyed by the central bank published today.  Brazil may use all available instruments to contain the
real’s volatility and market dysfunction, including selling
dollars in the  spot market , futures market or in credit lines,
Tombini told Valor in a story published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
