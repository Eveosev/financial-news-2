Rubber is headed for the biggest
glut on record, prolonging the bear market that began in April,
as supply exceeds demand for a third year and Southeast Asian
exporters ended curbs on shipments.  The surplus will expand 57 percent to 490,000 metric tons
this year, enough to meet U.S. demand for six months, according
to RCMA Commodities Asia Group, the Singapore-based company that
has traded rubber for nine decades. Futures in  Tokyo , a global
benchmark, will drop at least another 4.9 percent to 225 yen a
kilogram ($2,365 a ton) by the end of December, according to the
median of 16 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Five
anticipate 200 yen, a price last seen in 2009.  Thailand, Malaysia and  Indonesia , representing about 70
percent of supply, failed to agree on new curbs at a meeting
last week after reducing exports by 300,000 tons in the six
months through March. While record global car production signals
rising demand for tires, that won’t end the glut caused by
farmers expanding output by 18 percent in three years after
prices more than doubled since the end of 2008.  “There isn’t enough demand out there to absorb the
surplus,” said  Kazuhiko Saito , the chief analyst at Fujitomi
Co. in Tokyo who has covered the market for almost a quarter
century. “We’re going to see an influx of rubber unless
governments intervene as production from Southeast Asia moves
into high gear.”  Raw Materials  Rubber fell 22 percent to 236.5 yen on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange, or Tocom, this year and is now 56 percent below the
record 535.7 yen reached in February 2011. Lower prices should
reduce costs for Bridgestone Corp., Michelin & Cie. and Goodyear
Tire & Rubber Co., the biggest tiremakers.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials
dropped 2.1 percent since the start of January and the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities climbed 8.1 percent. Treasuries
lost 1.2 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  RCMA Commodities Asia was anticipating a 2013 surplus of
353,000 tons in March and increased its estimate because of
signs that demand in  China , Europe and the U.S. is weakening.  The International Rubber Study Group also may need to
increase its forecast for a 179,000-ton glut because consumption
is weaker than anticipated, said Lekshmi Nair, a senior
economist at the Singapore-based group. The 35-nation body said
in January that demand would rise about 6 percent to 11.6
million tons and production 3.2 percent to 11.8 million tons.
The new forecast will be released next month, Nair said.  New Measures  Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia also failed to extend
their export curbs at a meeting in April. Tokyo futures had
already plunged more than 20 percent from this year’s high of
337.8 yen in February by then. Officials from the International
Tripartite Rubber Council met again June 12 and 13 without
deciding on any new measures.  Thailand  had sought to reverse the slump by unilaterally
extending its export restrictions for 60 days. While that helped
futures rally to 299 yen by May 13, the slump resumed before the
additional curbs ended. Thai export prices fell 14 percent to
85.5 baht a kilogram ($2,780 a ton) this year from the peak of
198.3 baht in 2011, according to data from the Rubber Research
Institute of Thailand.  The imbalance between supply and demand may be superseded
in Tokyo trading by moves in the yen, which reached a four-year
low last month against the dollar amid the Bank of  Japan ’s
monetary stimulus measures. A weaker yen increases the appeal of
futures denominated in the currency and was the main reason why
the Tocom rubber contract jumped 20 percent in less than four
weeks from the middle of April, said Makoto Sugitani, head of
sales at commodity broker Newedge Japan Inc.  Yen Weakens  Price swings in futures have doubled since February to the
highest level in 18 months, increasing the challenges for
forecasters. Predictions in the Bloomberg survey of analysts
ranged from 200 yen to 400 yen. The yen is forecast to average
105 to the dollar in the fourth quarter, a depreciation of 10
percent from now, according to the median of 74 analyst
forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  “Rubber futures in Tokyo will rally again if the yen
resumes its decline,” said Tokyo-based Sugitani, who correctly
predicted in October that prices would advance 10 percent by the
end of 2012. “The yen is the biggest factor in determining the
direction.”  Tocom futures dropped 4.4 percent last week as the yen
rallied the most since July 2009, with investors reassessing the
BOJ’s stimulus.  Growing Cycle  Rubber production is expanding as trees planted from 2006
to 2008 become mature enough for tapping this year, said  Kona
Haque , an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in  London . Rubber
rallied 23 percent in Tokyo in 2006 and 2007, encouraging more
planting. Futures doubled in 2009.  China, the largest buyer, will import 14 percent less in
the seven months ending in December than a year earlier, the
Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries estimates.
Purchases are slowing after shipments jumped 27 percent in the
first five months of the year, according to the Kuala Lumpur-based group, whose members represent about 93 percent of supply.  Inventories in Qingdao, China’s main hub, reached a record
371,100 tons on April 26, according to Cai Zhiwei, the general
manager at the Qingdao International Rubber Exchange Market.
Stockpiles were 350,700 tons on June 14.  China accounts for 33 percent of global demand and tires
represent 70 percent of natural-rubber consumption in the
country, according to the exchange’s estimate.  Heavy Industry  While demand will increase this year for tires used for
 passenger  vehicles in China, the world’s largest automobile
market, it will slow for large trucks as the government shifts
its focus from heavy industry to more consumption-driven growth,
Shen Jinrong, chairman of tiremaker Hangzhou Zhongce Rubber Co.,
said in March.  A tire for a medium or heavy commercial vehicle uses as
much as 18 kilograms (40 pounds) of natural rubber, while those
for passenger cars contain less than 1 kilogram, according to
CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, a brokerage in Hong Kong. Global
automobile sales will rise above 83 million units to a record
this year, according to LMC Automotive Ltd., a research company
in Oxford,  England .  Bridgestone (5108) , the biggest tiremaker, used 450,000 tons of
natural and synthetic rubber in the first quarter, 4.3 percent
less than a year earlier as Japanese and U.S. demand weakened,
the Tokyo-based company said May 8. The company still expects to
consume a record 1.93 million tons this year, said Makoto
Shiomi, a spokesman for the company.  The company’s shares rose 1.4 percent in Tokyo to 3,255 yen
while Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. advanced 1.7 percent to
1,560 yen.  “We’re quite negative unless there is government
intervention,” said Chris Pardey, RCMA’s chief executive
officer and a former commodities trader at Cargill Inc. and
Noble Group Ltd. “Demand estimates for Europe, China and now
also the U.S. are falling.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
