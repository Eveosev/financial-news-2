The New York Yankees withstood a
five-run, ninth-inning comeback by the  Los Angeles Angels  to
pull out a 6-5 victory in the finale of a 10-game road trip.  Mariano Rivera struck out  Albert Pujols  with the bases
loaded in the bottom of the ninth inning yesterday in Anaheim,
California, as the Yankees snapped a five-game losing streak.  CC Sabathia took a shutout into the ninth inning for New
York and Travis Hafner hit a three-run home run in the third
inning to end an 0-for-23 slump before the Angels’ surge.  Rivera entered the game in the ninth inning with the bases
loaded and the Yankees leading 6-1, and gave up a run-scoring
groundout, a two-run single to Alberto Callaspo and another run-scoring single to Peter Bourjos, before striking out Pujols on
three pitches to end the game.  The Yankees (38-31) said before the game that tests on
first baseman  Mark Teixeira ’s right wrist showed inflammation,
but no tear. A torn tendon sheath in the wrist had kept Teixeira
out until May 31 and he’s hit .151 with three home runs in 53
at-bats since returning.  Teixeira, who was removed from the Yankees’ game two days
ago in the fourth inning after feeling discomfort in his wrist,
could be headed back to the disabled list.  “If he was to re-tear it, that would probably be it for
the season,” Yankees manager  Joe Girardi  told reporters
yesterday. “We’re looking at some inflammation and we’re going
to have to see how long it’s going to take to get back.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
