Airline pilot Patrick Smith—a.k.a. Salon's former "Ask the Pilot" columnist—may have lots of fans, but airport bookstore managers apparently aren't among them. His newest book,  Cockpit Confidential ,  is even better than his first ( Ask the Pilot )…but it's hard to find in airport bookstores. Smith, in case you didn't discover him during his years as a Salon contributor, doesn't just know everything about air travel, he possesses a rare knack for explaining it in lucid and witty prose—from turbulence to cabin air quality, to the job of a pilot to those strange noises you hear in-flight. As such, he offers a refreshing antidote to the often overheated and misinformed reporting on aviation safety (see how he and our own Clive Irving recently  weighed in  on an overblown scare story in the NY Times.) So by all means buy a copy before your next flight. Just don't wait to get to the airport to buy it: you may be out of luck. "It's like being in a Kafka story," mused Smith when I contacted him recently. He noted that he also saw this when one of the largest airport retailers in the country didn't stock a single copy of  Ask the Pilot.  During recent layovers in Minneapolis-St. Paul and Detroit airport, he said, he scoured numerous newsstands as well as a full-size bookstore, autograph pen in hand, searching in vain for a copy of  Cockpit Confidential.  Even store managers who were sympathetic to him said they couldn't do anything—purchasing decisions are made at some far-off corporate headquarters. So, why can't you find one of the best books on air travel at an airport? The answer is depressingly mundane: airport booksellers are really just giant nationwide retailing chains, and given the tight space constraints and costs of running an airport location, they'll just go with the safest choices: the latest bestsellers, children's books, and business how-to tomes. As Smith himself noted when persuing the shelves—"they did have 15 copies of the latest Mike Piazza autobiography," plus others by such well-known belle-lettrists such as Carol Burnett and accused killer Amanda Knox. Although several airport concession operators (including HMS Host) have no plans to stock it, there has been some good news: The book will apparently be sold through one of the major airport retailers, Hudson Booksellers, which has outlets at dozens of U.S. airports. Even so, several of the largest airport concession operators, such as HMS Host, have no plans to stock it, Smith said. Update 6/11:  Patrick Smith's  Cockpit Confidential  is now being stocked by airport chain Hudson Booksellers More from  Condé Nast Traveler :
