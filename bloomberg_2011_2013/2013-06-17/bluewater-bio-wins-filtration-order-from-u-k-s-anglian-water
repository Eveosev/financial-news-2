Bluewater Bio International, a U.K.
wastewater-treatment company, won a three-year order for a
filtration technology system that’s part of a solids removal
program from Anglian Water. No terms were disclosed.  The London-based company said today in a statement that the
order from the eastern England water provider follows contracts
that involve its products in the upgrading of the largest
wastewater-treatment works in Bahrain and Severn Trent Plc water
unit’s Ashbourne sewage-treatment facility in the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
