New Zealand  Prime Minister John Key
said he wants the country’s central bank to exempt first-home
buyers from tighter mortgage lending criteria it is planning to
implement.  “It strikes me that they’re the very people we’re trying
to assist,” Key said at his regular weekly press conference in
Wellington today. “So I don’t want to see tools implemented
that lock them out of the market.”  With  house prices  surging in Auckland and Christchurch, New
Zealand’s largest and third-largest cities, the Reserve Bank has
said it may seek to restrain bank lending by imposing limits on
the proportion of risky mortgages they can hold on their books.
The proposal is to lower the number of loans made at more than
80 percent of a property’s value.  The RBNZ is reluctant to raise  interest rates  from a
record-low 2.5 percent because inflation is running below its 2
percent target and it doesn’t want to fan gains in the  New
Zealand dollar .  Key said the aim of the new mortgage lending measures,
which the  Reserve Bank  negotiated with the government, was to
help rein in house-price inflation, not make it harder for
poorer people to enter the market. He had made his views known
to central bank governor Graeme Wheeler.  “I think they’re sympathetic to what I’m saying, but there
are challenges,” Key said. “I understand that, but in the end
I don’t think it’s as challenging as everybody says.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
