(Corrects amount to million from billion in headline and
first paragraph.)  The defunct Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. brokerage will allow a Netherlands affiliate a customer
claim of $2.4 million, out of $10.9 million originally demanded,
trustee James Giddens said in a June 14 filing in federal court
in  Manhattan . Giddens has said he is trying to resolve remaining
claims still being disputed by customers and creditors so he can
finish paying allowed claims.  To contact the reporter on this story:
