Copper gained for a second day in
 London  as aluminum ended the longest losing streak in three
months after data showed a revival in U.S. manufacturing. Other
industrial metals also advanced.  Copper for delivery in three months gained as much as 1.2
percent to $7,176 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
before trading at $7,159 as of 9:48 a.m.  Shanghai  time. Aluminum
rose 0.9 percent to $1,867 a ton, gaining for the first time in
eight days after falling to $1,850 a ton on June 14, the lowest
since May 29.  Factory output in the U.S. climbed 0.1 percent after
dropping 0.4 percent in April and 0.3 percent in March,
according to Federal Reserve data issued on June 14.  “The data showed an improvement in U.S. industries, which
is certainly positive for industrial demand for metals,” Ma
Jian, an analyst at Orient Futures Co., said by phone from
Shanghai.  Metal for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange climbed 0.7 percent to 51,790  yuan  ($8,449) a ton, and
July futures on the Comex in New York rose 0.9 percent to
$3.2305 per pound.  Net-short positions, or wagers on falling Comex prices,
held by funds expanded to 18,722 futures and options as of June
11 from 6,626 a week earlier, according to the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.  Two aluminum buyers in  Japan , Asia’s biggest importer,
agreed to keep premiums paid to producers steady at $249 a ton
in the third quarter over the price of aluminum for immediate
delivery on the LME.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
