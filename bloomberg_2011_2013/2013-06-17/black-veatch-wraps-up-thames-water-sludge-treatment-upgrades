Black & Veatch Corp. completed
upgrades at two sewage-treatment facilities for Thames Water,
the U.K.’s largest water company, which recycles all of its
sludge, most of it re-used as fertilizer for agriculture.  No terms were disclosed for the infrastructure improvements
at Basingstoke and Bracknell’s sewage-treatment facilities that
include sludge being “dewatered” so it can be stored as a
solid, Black & Veatch said today in a statement.  The  Overland Park , Kansas-based company helps build and
develop infrastructure in energy, water, telecommunications and
government services while Kemble Water Holdings Ltd.’s Thames
Water unit serves almost 14 million customers in the London and
Thames Valley area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
