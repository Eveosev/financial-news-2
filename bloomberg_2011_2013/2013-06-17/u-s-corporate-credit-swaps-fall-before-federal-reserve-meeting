A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk fell before the  Federal Reserve ’s monetary policy meeting
begins this week.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased
1.7 basis points to a mid-price of 82.4 basis points at 8:40
a.m. in  New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors are trying to determine when the Fed will scale
back its unprecedented policy of quantitative easing, in which
it purchases $85 billion of mortgage and Treasury bonds each
month. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will announce the central
bank’s policy on June 19 after the two-day Federal Open Market
Committee meeting.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
