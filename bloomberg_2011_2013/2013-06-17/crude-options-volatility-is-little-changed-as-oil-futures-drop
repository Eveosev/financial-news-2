Crude oil options volatility was
little changed as the underlying futures fell for the first time
in four days.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 18.89 percent on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange as of 2:40 p.m., compared with 18.95 percent
on June 14.  West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery slid 4
cents to settle at $98.03 a barrel on the Nymex.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
August $82 puts, which gained 1 cent to 7 cents a barrel on
volume of 3,177 lots traded at 3:17 p.m. July $98 calls were the
second-most active, falling 46 cents to 4 cents a barrel on
volume of 3,117 contracts.  Calls accounted for 52 percent of electronic trading
volume. In the prior session, puts accounted for 52 percent of
158,224 contracts.  July $98 calls were the most-active options traded June 14,
with 7,507 contracts changing hands. They rose 23 cents to 46
cents a barrel. July $100 calls increased 1 cent to 5 cents a
barrel on volume of 5,734 lots.  Open interest was highest for September $85 puts with
53,304 contracts. Next were July $110 calls with 36,681 lots and
July $90 puts with 36,132.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
