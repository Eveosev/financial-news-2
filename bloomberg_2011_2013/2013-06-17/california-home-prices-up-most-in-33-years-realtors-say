California   home prices  rose by the
most in three decades as a shortage of houses on the market
spurred competition among buyers, the California Association of
Realtors said today.  The median price for an existing single-family home jumped
to $417,350 in May, up 32 percent from a year earlier, the Los
Angeles-based association said in a statement. It was the 15th
consecutive annual increase and the largest since at least 1980,
when the group started tracking the data.  Parts of California, including the  San Francisco  Bay area,
have “extremely low housing inventory,” leading to the
increase in prices, the Realtors association said. The median
price in San Francisco surged 28 percent from a year earlier to
$947,260, breaking a previous record set in May 2007.  “The Bay area, in particular, has been experiencing strong
price appreciation, thanks to the region’s robust economic
growth, extremely low housing inventory and an increasing demand
from international buyers,” Don Faught, president of the group,
said in the statement.  Sales in the state fell 3.6 percent from a year earlier to
an annualized rate of 431,370 homes, the association said.  More homebuyers are putting down larger down payments and
“opting for more stable loan products,” Leslie Appleton-Young,
the group’s chief economist, said in the statement. “While home
prices are increasing at levels above those observed in
2006-2007, the fundamentals of the housing market are much more
solid than what we experienced a few years ago.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
