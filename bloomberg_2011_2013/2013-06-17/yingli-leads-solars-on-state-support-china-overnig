Solar manufacturers led gains among
Chinese companies traded in New York after Premier  Li Keqiang 
pledged measures to boost demand and provide financing support.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. jumped 1.9 percent to 88.08
yesterday, the biggest gain in two months.  Yingli Green Energy
Holding Co. (YGE) , the world’s largest solar-panel maker, surged 13
percent and LDK Solar Co. rallied.  Qihoo 360 Technology Co. (QIHU) 
climbed to a record high while  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  rebounded the most in
11 months. Non-deliverable  yuan  forwards strengthened the most
since August 2011.  The Bloomberg Industries Large Solar Index, which tracks 17
solar energy companies, soared 5.1 percent as Germany’s
 Solarworld AG (SWV)  to Yingli surged. China’s government said June 14
that power grids should give priority access to solar energy
while lenders need to offer financing help. It also vowed to
encourage mergers and acquisitions among solar companies. The
nation is drafting a plan to use renewable energy for heating,
according to Shanghai Securities News.  “That’s a lot more focus on cleaner air and they are
trying to reduce the growth of coal in favor of cleaner
resources,”  David Smith , the manager of the Gabelli Green Fund
at  Gamco Investors Inc. (GBL) , said in an telephone interview from
Purchase, New York. “The government is likely to encourage more
consolidation in the industry. Prices on solar cells and modules
have been improving.”  ETF Jumps  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., climbed 1.5 percent to $34.48,
the biggest rally in two weeks. Puts protecting against a 10
percent drop in the ETF cost 4.3 points more than calls betting
on a 10 percent increase last week, according to three-month
option data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the highest since
April 17. The gap narrowed to 4 points yesterday.  American depositary receipts of Yingli, based in Baoding in
China’s Hebei province, surged to $3.25 in  New York , the
steepest jump since May 21.  The company’s affiliate Yingli Group Co., controlled by
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Liansheng Miao, signed
strategic cooperation agreements with local governments in
Yunnan Province on June 13 for the construction of a 3-gigawatt
photovoltaic power plant that will begin this year, according to
a  statement  on the group’s website.  China may introduce new policies on solar power subsidy as
early as this month, China Securities Journal reported, citing
unidentified people.  Qihoo Climbs  LDK, based in Xinyu of Jiangxi province, advanced 4.4
percent to $1.42, gaining the most in a week.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) ,
based in Changzhou, surged 5.1 percent to $6.23, the highest

biggest solar-panel maker in 2011, jumped 4.1 percent to $1.  Qihoo, a software developer that owns China’s most-used
browser and second-biggest search engine, soared 8.8 percent to
$47.48, the highest level since its U.S. public offering in
March 2011.  Beijing-based Qihoo has the best chance among all
competitors seeking to acquire Sogou, a web search engine owned
by Sohu.com Inc., 86Research Ltd. said in a note to clients
yesterday.  Cnooc (CEO) , the nation’s biggest offshore oil explorer, advanced
4.2 percent to $173.89, soaring the most since July 2012.  Australia awarded new offshore oil exploration permits to
companies including Cnooc, according to a statement on
Australian Energy Minister Gary Gray’s website.  Yuan Gains  Twelve-month yuan forwards strengthened 0.94 percent versus
the dollar to 6.2105 yesterday in New York, rising the most
since August 11, 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. The

after China’s central bank set the reference rate at a record
high of 6.1598. The yuan is allowed to trade a maximum 1 percent
either side of the fixing rate.  The government is scheduled to release property prices for
May and foreign direct investment data today.  The Standard and Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.8 percent to
1,639.04, after falling 1 percent last week. The Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index in  Hong Kong  climbed 0.8 percent to 9,744.48,
