in China gained 1.4 percent to $113.60 on June 14, according to
The Steel Index Ltd.  “More and more steel mills are getting their maintenance
checks done in the summer so output has been slowing recently,
reducing an inventory overhang,” Ren Xinlei, an analyst at
Luzheng Futures Co., said by phone from Jinan today.  The average spot price for rebar in China declined for a
fifth day on June 14 by 0.5 percent to 3,375  yuan  a ton, the
