SGS SA (SGSN) , the world’s largest product
inspector, rose the most in almost six weeks after saying it
bought Qingdao Yuanshun Automotive Services Co. Ltd.  SGS advanced as much as 3.1 percent to 2,168 Swiss francs
in Zurich, the most since May 8, and was up 3 percent at 12:05
p.m. local time, giving the Geneva-based company a market value
of about 17 billion francs ($18.4 billion). More than 6,000
shares changed hands, or 42 percent of the three-month average.  Qingdao Yuanshun, based in Qingdao in  China ’s Shandong
province, specializes in vehicle testing and runs two stations.
The company is privately owned and employs 72 people.  The acquisition marks the “first steps in the automotive
strategy to enter the Chinese market,” Jean-Philippe Bertschy,
a Zurich-based analyst with Vontobel, wrote in a note to
investors. “The Qingdao Yuanshun Automotive Services
acquisition is strategic, as SGS is entering the fast-growing
Chinese vehicle inspection market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
