“Kinky Boots,” “Motown” and other shows that won Tony Awards or performed on the telecast reported record weekly sales.  Grosses rose 4 percent to $1.5 million for the new-musical winner, “Kinky Boots,” in the seven days ending on Sunday, according to the trade association the  Broadway League . The Cyndi Lauper musical’s weekly sales have risen more than 50 percent since its April 4 opening.  “Motown” rose 3 percent to $1.4 million. The top-selling new musical most weeks, it’s been outsold by “Kinky Boots” for the past two.  “Matilda” rose 4 percent to $1.2 million. “Pippin,” named best musical revival, reached $1 million for the first time.  Some 7.3 million viewers watched the show, according to CBS, citing  Nielsen (NLSN)  data. It was the ceremony’s biggest audience since 2009.  Christopher Durang’s comedy “Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike,” the best-play winner, was the prime non-musical beneficiary, up 18 percent to $654,000.  Cicely Tyson’s win for lead actress in “The Trip to Bountiful” didn’t much help the Horton Foote drama, which played to houses more than a third empty. Holland Taylor’s one-woman show, “Ann,” was two-thirds empty despite publicity after posting its closing notice two months ahead of schedule. Sales fell to a new low, $186,000.  Alan Cumming ’s one-man “Macbeth” also hit bottom, $264,000, down 13 percent. Its run ends on July 14.  Total Broadway ticket sales were $24.8 million last week, up 6 percent from the previous week.
