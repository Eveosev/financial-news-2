Spot wholesale power across the  New
York  state grid surged after imports from Canada were halted.  Manhattan prices climbed to a 19-day high after the New
York Independent System Operator Inc., the state grid operator,
reported an unplanned outage of the 765-kilovolt Chateauguay-Massena transmission line at 11:50 a.m. Imports of hydropower
from  Quebec  fell to zero from 1,314 megawatts.  New York City power  jumped as high as $1,534.80 at 12:15
p.m. after  averaging  $47.46 a megawatt-hour from 7 a.m. until
noon, grid data compiled by Bloomberg show. The on-peak average
was up 48 percent from the June 14 full-day average of $32.06,
which was the lowest level since Oct. 29. On-peak hours run from
7 a.m. until 11 p.m. Monday through Friday.  Electricity consumption is topping forecasts across the
three main East Coast grids on hotter weather. Temperatures from
Maine to North Carolina will be above normal through tomorrow,
according to WSI Corp. in Andover, Massachusetts. Prices on the
grids slumped on June 14 after mild weather and heavy rain
reduced the need for power to run air conditioners.  Spot on-peak power for  Boston  gained $25.21, or 84 percent,
to $55.02 a megawatt-hour as of noon from the June 14 full-day
average of $29.81, also the least since Oct. 29, data from ISO
New England Inc. show.  Power at PJM Interconnection LLC’s Western Hub, which
includes prices from Washington to Erie,  Pennsylvania , increased
$15.67, or 48 percent, to $48.28 a megawatt-hour.  Rising Temperatures  The high temperature in New York City today may be 85 degrees
Fahrenheit (29 Celsius), 5 above normal, and Baltimore may be 3
degrees higher than the usual reading at 89, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  New York City power  demand  was 8,329 megawatts at 11:20
a.m., 5.1 percent higher than the  day-ahead outlook . Consumption
on PJM’s 13-state grid, stretching from  New Jersey  into North
Carolina and  Illinois , was 113,456 megawatts at 11:30 a.m., 6
percent higher than the forecast.  Electricity use  on the six-state New England grid was
18,302 megawatts at 11:25 a.m., 2 percent higher than the
forecast for the time, according to the grid operator’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
