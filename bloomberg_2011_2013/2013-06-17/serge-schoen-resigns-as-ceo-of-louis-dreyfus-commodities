Serge Schoen, chief executive
officer of Louis Dreyfus Commodities, decided to resign with
effect from the end of this month, the company said.  Ciro Echesortu, the chief operating officer and head trader
since 2009, was appointed the new CEO, Louis Dreyfus said in a
statement e-mailed today. Schoen will join the parent company,
Louis Dreyfus Holding B.V., in an advisory capacity and will
remain a member of the supervisory board of Louis Dreyfus
Commodities Holdings, it said.  “Under Serge’s and Ciro’s leadership, our team has brought
the company to its leading position in agribusiness globally,”
Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, chairperson of the Louis Dreyfus Group,
said in the statement. “The company is now well positioned to
continue its impressive trajectory.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
