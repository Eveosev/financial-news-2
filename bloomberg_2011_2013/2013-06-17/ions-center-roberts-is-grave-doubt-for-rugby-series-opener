British and Irish Lions center Jamie
Roberts is likely to miss this week’s opening rugby Test against
 Australia , the combined team’s head doctor said.  Roberts, who was named the Lions’ player of the series
against South Africa four years ago, strained his hamstring in
the 47-17 win against the New South Wales Waratahs two days ago.
The Lions start their best-of-three series against the Wallabies
on June 22 in Brisbane.  “Jamie is a grave doubt for this week, there is no doubt
about that,” James Robson told reporters in Sydney today. “You
only had to see how much discomfort he was in at the weekend.
However, further assessment will be made later in the week as to
his availability going forward.”  Robson said he’ll give head coach Warren Gatland a full
report on player availability in two days, after the Lions face
the ACT Brumbies tomorrow in their sixth tour game. Ireland
winger Tommy Bowe, who fractured a bone in his hand on June 8,
is likely to join Roberts in being ruled out, Robson said.  Wales winger George North has “a great chance of being
fit” for the first Test as he recovers from hamstring tightness
and England center Manu Tuilagi is “progressing on a daily
basis” from a shoulder injury and will be further assessed this
week, Robson added.  The Lions, who have won all five matches on tour so far,
face the Australian Conference-leading Brumbies in Canberra
tomorrow. Gatland is scheduled to announce his team to face the
Wallabies on June 20.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
