Japanese  shares  rose, with the  Topix (TPX) 
index rebounding from four weeks of losses, amid lower volume
ahead of tomorrow’s  Federal Reserve  policy meeting. The yen
weakened from its strongest against the dollar in two months.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , which gets 75 percent of its sales
abroad, advanced 2 percent. Chiyoda Corp. surged 8 percent after
Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded the industrial-plant
maker. Japan Tobacco Inc. climbed 5 percent after saying
domestic cigarette sales rose in May. Mitsubishi Estate Co. fell
2.4 percent as developers retreated the most among the Topix’s
33 industry groups.  The Topix added 2.7 percent to 1,084.72 at the close of
trading in Tokyo. Volume was about 44 percent below the 30-day
average ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting that
begins tomorrow. Only 83 shares fell on the 1,709-member gauge.
The Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 2.7 percent to 13,033.12.  “The time for a rebound in Japanese shares is getting
closer,” said Kenji Shiomura, a Tokyo-based senior strategist
at Daiwa Securities Group Inc., Japan’s second-largest
brokerage. “The focus is on the FOMC and expectations are that
 Ben Bernanke  is going to say something that calms the market.”  Fed Chairman Bernanke will hold a press conference on June
19 after the two-day policy meeting. Almost $3 trillion has been
erased from global markets since he said on May 22 that the
central bank could begin winding back stimulus if the U.S. job
market shows sustainable improvement.  While all 37 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  predict
U.S. borrowing costs will be kept in a zero to 0.25 percent
range, investors will be looking for signs of when the Fed will
taper its bond buying.  Shares Falling  The Topix has dropped about 15 percent from its recent high
on May 22. Shares have declined amid a strengthening yen,
disappointment about Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s growth strategy
and concern the U.S. Fed will scale back stimulus.  The gauge traded at 1.15 times  book value , compared with
2.4 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.6 for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  S&P 500  climbed 0.6 percent. The index fell
0.6 percent on June 14 as the  International Monetary Fund  cut
its 2014 outlook for the U.S. and urged the central bank to
carefully manage its exit from stimulus. Futures on the Nikkei
225 in  Osaka  rose 2.3 percent today. The Topix Core 30 index of
Japan’s largest stocks rose 2 percent to 578.63.  “From a technical perspective and looking at valuations,
the market looks affordable,” said Shuichi Saito, general
manager at Chibagin Asset Management Co. “It looks like today’s
buying was fueled by individual investors. The Topix Core 30
hasn’t risen very much, which indicates foreign investors are
waiting in the wings before the FOMC meeting.”  Yen Weakens  Shares gained as the yen weakened 0.6 percent to 94.94 per
dollar today, after surging the most since July 2009 last week
and touching 93.98 on June 14. The currency lost as much as 19
percent this year through May 17, weakening past 100 per dollar.
After four weeks of advances its year-to-date fall has now been
reduced to 8.6 percent.  Toyota, the world’s No. 1 carmaker, climbed 2 percent to
5,700 yen, the biggest single boost to the Topix. Bridgestone
Corp., which gets about 77 percent of its revenue abroad,
advanced 4.7 percent to 3,210 yen as tiremakers increased.
Panasonic Corp., which derives about half of sales overseas,
rose 4 percent to 747 yen.  Game Stocks  Gamemakers advanced today. Nintendo Co., the producer of
the Wii console, added 9.3 percent to 10,440 yen in Osaka.
 Square Enix Holdings Co. (9684) , developer of the Final Fantasy series,
jumped 7.5 percent to 1,160 yen. DeNA Co., which operates the
social-gaming site Mobage-town, climbed 6.7 percent to 2,201
yen.  Among other shares that rose, Chiyoda climbed 8 percent to
1,140 yen after Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised the stock
to buy from underperform, citing prospects for shale gas
projects in the U.S. Even with today’s advance, the engineering
company is the  worst-performing  stock on the Nikkei 225 since
elections were announced in mid-November that triggered a rally
in Japanese shares.  Tokuyama Corp., the Japanese chemical producer buying
control of a subsidiary of  Switzerland ’s Holcim Ltd., soared 17
percent to 331 yen for the biggest gain on the Nikkei 225.
Shares in the producer of chemicals, resins and cement are up 75
percent this year, almost triple the gain for the Topix.  Cigarette Sales  Japan  Tobacco jumped 5 percent to 3,455 yen today, the
third-biggest boost on the Topix. May sales volume rose 0.4
percent to 10.2 billion cigarettes in Japan, the nation’s third-largest company by market value said on June 14.  Among stocks that fell, a gauge tracking real-estate shares
lost the most among the Topix’s industry groups and was one of
only two groups to retreat. Mitsubishi Estate Co., Japan’s
largest developer by market value, lost 2.4 percent to 2,272
yen, the biggest drop on the Nikkei 225. Mitsui Fudosan Co., the
largest by sales, decreased 0.6 percent to 2,731 yen. The five
biggest decliners on the Nikkei 225 were all property companies.  The Topix has swung an average of about 3.5 percent daily
since May 22. The gauge’s 100-day historic volatility reached
29.86 today, its highest since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
Volatility on the Nikkei 225 fell 6 percent to 39.10, indicating
traders expect a swing of about 11 percent for the measure in
the next 30 days.  The Nikkei 225 and Topix are still up more than 25 percent
this year, making Japan the best-performing major equity market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
