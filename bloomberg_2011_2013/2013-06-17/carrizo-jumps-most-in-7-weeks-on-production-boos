Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc. (CRZO) , the oil and
natural gas producer that has more than tripled output in the
past five years,  jumped  the most in more than seven weeks after
raising 2013 production targets.  Carrizo gained 6.5 percent to $27.87 at 11:06 a.m. in New
York, the most intraday since April 24.  Results in  Texas ’ Eagle Ford shale have been “exceeding
management’s expectations,” the Houston-based company said in a
press release today. Carrizo raised its 2013 production growth
target from 28 percent to 40 percent, and forecast second-quarter oil output will reach as much as 11,200 barrels a day,
up from a prior estimate of as much as 10,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
