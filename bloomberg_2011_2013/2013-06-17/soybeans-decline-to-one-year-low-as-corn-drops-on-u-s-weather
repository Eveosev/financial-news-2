Soybeans tumbled to the lowest level
in a year and corn extended the biggest weekly loss since April
as favorable growing conditions in the U.S. boosted optimism the
world’s largest producer will harvest record crops.  Soybeans for delivery in November, after the U.S. harvest,
fell as much as 1.6 percent to $12.775 a bushel on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the cheapest for the most-active contract since
June 6, 2012. Futures were at $12.8375 by 10:24 a.m. in
Singapore on volume that was 78 percent above the 100-day
average for that time of day.  Thunderstorms forecast last weekend helped maintain surplus
moisture for crops in the Midwest, while warmer weather is
expected for an extended period, favoring late planted crops,
DTN reported June 14. Record U.S.  soybean  and  corn  harvests,
recovering from last year’s drought, will increase world
production to all-time highs, the government forecasts.  “Weather has been suitable for crop development in the
U.S.,”  Hiroyuki Kikukawa , general manager for researcher at
Nihon Unicom Inc., wrote in an e-mail today in a reply to
Bloomberg questions. “With favorable growing conditions in the
U.S., farmers are on course to produce a record crop.”  Corn for delivery in December lost 1.1 percent to $5.2725 a
bushel, after losing 4.6 percent last week. That’s the worst
weekly performance for the most-active contract since the five
days ended April 5, excluding the period through May 24 when the
contract rolled to December from July. Wheat for delivery in
September declined 0.8 percent to $6.83 a bushel.  Farmers in the U.S. will harvest a record 355.7 million
metric tons of corn in the year beginning Sept. 1, boosting
 world  output to the highest ever and rebuilding inventories, the
Department of Agriculture said June 12. U.S. soybean production
will surge to an all-time high of 92.3 million tons, also
lifting world  output  and  inventories  to records, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
