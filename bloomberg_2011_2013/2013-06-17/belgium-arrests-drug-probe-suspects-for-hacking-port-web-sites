Belgium  arrested two people
suspected of hacking two “large” container terminal operators’
websites to enable narcotics imports through the port of
Antwerp, Dutch authorities said.  “Two information- and communications-technology
specialists were arrested last week and are suspected of being
responsible” for the high-technology part of operation, the
Dutch public prosecutor said on its  website  today. The pair are
still being held and have made several confessions in the
meantime, the prosecutor said.  Seven suspects who were probably involved in the large-scale import of hard drugs were arrested in the Netherlands two
weeks ago, according to the Dutch prosecutor. The Belgian
authorities earlier seized several shipments of narcotics,
including batches of cocaine and heroin, the prosecutor said.  Computers operated by shipping companies and agents were
also manipulated by installing malicious software hidden in an
e-mail attachment, and keyloggers that covertly track keystrokes
on a machine, the public prosecutor said. Belgium has put out an
international alert for two more suspects, the Dutch authority
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
