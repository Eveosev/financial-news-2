U.S. retail sales of video-game
hardware, software and accessories fell 25 percent to $386.3
million last month as consumers shifted to digital titles played
on mobile devices and awaited next-generation consoles.  Hardware sales fell 31 percent to $96 million from a year
earlier, Port  Washington , New York-based  NPD Group Inc.  said in
an e-mail today. Software sales for the current generation
consoles also tumbled 31 percent, to $175.1 million.  The games and console market is in the middle of a two-year
slump as consumers increasingly play Web-delivered titles on
smartphones and tablets and hard-core gamers await the first new
machines from  Sony Corp. (6758)  and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  in seven years.
Earlier this month, in a face-off between the rivals’ new
machines at the annual E3 video-game conference in Los Angeles,
Sony’s PlayStation 4 won the first round by pricing its machine
$100 below Microsoft’s Xbox One and offering more flexibility
about how to play, trade and sell games.  Total spending on U.S. video-game hardware and software,
including used games, rental and digitally delivered content,
was $787 million, said Liam Callahan, an NPD analyst. Physical
sales accounted for about 50 percent of total U.S. spending on
games, NPD said.  Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, said in an earlier
statement that U.S. retailers sold 114,000 Xbox 360 game
consoles in May, a decline of 29 percent from 160,000 a year
earlier. The company held its spot with the No. 1 selling major
console model.  Both the PlayStation 4, priced at $399, and the Xbox One,
priced at $499, will go on sale this fall. Nintendo Co.’s Wii U,
released in November, sells for about $300 in the U.S. and has
missed sales targets.  Nintendo’s 3DS handheld game console edged out Microsoft as
the top-selling platform, including hardware and software, in
May, Callahan said in the statement, without citing figures.  The Kyoto, Japan-based  company  said in a statement today
that its titles “Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D” and “Luigi’s
Mansion: Dark Moon” helped increase software sales by more than
60 percent last month, compared with a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
