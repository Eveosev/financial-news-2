North Carolina  State’s baseball team
beat the top-seeded University of North Carolina 8-1 in their
opening game at the  College World Series .  Sophomore pitcher Carlos Rodon allowed one run on five hits
over nine innings with eight strikeouts as N.C. State won in its
first College World Series appearance since 1968.  North Carolina State advances to face UCLA, which knocked
off fourth-seeded Louisiana State 2-1 yesterday thanks to a pair
of errors by the Tigers that led to two unearned runs. LSU
entered the tournament with a .980 fielding percentage that
ranked as the fifth-best in the nation.  North Carolina (57-11) and LSU (57-10) will meet in a
loser’s bracket game tomorrow at TD Ameritrade Park in Omaha,
Nebraska, before N.C. State (50-14) plays UCLA (45-17)  Indiana (49-14) plays Mississippi State (49-18) today after
both teams won their opening games two days ago, while
Louisville (51-13) meets Oregon State (50-12) in an elimination
game. The championship series is scheduled for June 24-26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
