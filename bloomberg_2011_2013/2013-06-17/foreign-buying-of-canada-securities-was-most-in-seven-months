Foreigners bought the most Canadian
securities in seven months in April, government figures showed,
led by corporate bonds.  Purchases totaled C$14.9 billion ($14.7 billion) in April,
 Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. Foreign investors bought
C$12.8 billion of debt, including C$6.50 billion of corporate
bonds and C$3.20 billion of money-market paper sold by
provincial and local governments. Non-residents also bought
C$2.15 billion of Canadian stocks, according to the report.  The largest debt purchase since May 2012 was driven by
securities offered in U.S. dollars, Statistics Canada said. The
April buying increased the year-to-date total to C$23.9 billion,
greater than the C$16.1 billion for the same period last year.  The net purchase for March was revised to C$956 million
from C$1.19 billion.  Canadians  bought  C$2.81 billion of foreign securities in
April, including a C$3.47 billion purchase of debt and a C$662
million sale of equities, the first in eight months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
