The euro strengthened against the
dollar as an exit poll showed  Greece â€™s two largest pro-bailout
parties won enough seats to forge a parliamentary majority.  The results would give New Democracy and Pasok 159 seats,
if they agree to govern together, in the 300-member Greek
parliament, according to the poll broadcast on state-run
television NET. Official estimates are due after 9:30 p.m. in
Athens.  The euro rose 0.6 percent to $1.2710 from its closing price
in New York on June 15.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
