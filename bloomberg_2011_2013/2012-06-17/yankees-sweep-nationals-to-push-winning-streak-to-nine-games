winning streak to nine games by beating the Washington Nationals
4-1 to complete a three-game sweep of the series between
division leaders.  Curtis Granderson  and Robinson Cano hit solo home runs for
the Yankees in Washington, while starting pitcher Ivan Nova
allowed one run over 7 2/3 innings to win his fifth straight
start and improve to 9-2 on the Major League Baseball season.
The Yankees (40-25) have swept their past three series.  Adam LaRocheâ€™s solo homer in the second inning was the lone
run for the Nationals (38-26).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
