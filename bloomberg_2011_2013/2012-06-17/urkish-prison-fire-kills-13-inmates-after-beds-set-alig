A fire in a jail in southeastern
 Turkey  killed 13 people after inmates protested prison
conditions by setting fire to beds and blankets.  The government is investigating the incident at the E-Type
prison in the province of Sanliurfa, Justice Minister Sadullah
Ergin said, according to the state-run Anatolia news agency.  Five people were injured in the fire, Anatolia said.
Initial investigations showed rescue workers were unable to
reach the floor of the jail where the prisoners died because
protesters had blocked a stairwell with beds, Ergin said.  Protests at the jail are continuing with inmates shouting
slogans, Hurriyet newspaper reported.  Prisoners included Kurdish member of parliament Ibrahim
Ayhan, jailed during arrests of suspected supporters of the
outlawed Kurdistan Workersâ€™ Party, or PKK, Hurriyet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
