The  International Olympic Committee 
started an investigation after a newspaper said officials and
agents are selling black-market tickets for the London games at
up to 10 times face value.  The U.K.’s Sunday Times said there’s “widespread
corruption” involving tickets for 54 countries at the games,
which start July 27. Thousands of the best seats, including
marquee events such as the 100-meter final, have been “siphoned
off” from official supplies held by national Olympic
committees, the newspaper said.  Undercover reporters found 27 officials and agents were
willing to take part in black-market transactions, the Sunday
Times reported. In one instance, 1,500 tickets to events
including the opening and closing ceremonies were offered for
80,000 pounds ($125,000) in cash, it added.  The  IOC  said it’s taking “decisive action” on the matter
after holding an extraordinary meeting of its executive board.
It’s ordered an immediate inquiry and referred the allegations
to its independent ethics commission, it said in a statement.  “Should any irregularities be proven, the organization
will deal with those involved in an appropriate manner,” the
IOC said. “The national Olympic committees are autonomous
organizations, but if any of the cases are confirmed the IOC
will not hesitate to impose the strongest sanctions.”  The London organizing committee said it would support the
IOC investigation in any way it can.  “None of the tickets in question came from the allocation
to the British public,” it said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
