The European Union may propose the
introduction of short-term common debt instruments for euro-area
countries, termed euro bills,  Der Spiegel  reported, without
citing anyone.  The commonly guaranteed bonds could be issued by states up
to a predetermined percentage of economic output, and only if
rules were kept, the magazine reported.  A committee of EU President  Herman Van Rompuy , EU
Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, Eurogroup head Jean-
Claude Juncker and European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi 
intend to present the idea to heads of government at a summit in
Brussels this month, the magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
