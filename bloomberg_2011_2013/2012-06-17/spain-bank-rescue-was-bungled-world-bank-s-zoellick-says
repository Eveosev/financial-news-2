World Bank President  Robert Zoellick 
said that financial-market reaction to the rescue plan for
 Spain ’s banks shows that it was bungled.  The announcement of a 100 billion-euro bailout for Spain
failed to stop a rise in Spain’s borrowing costs to a euro-era
record last week.  With some $125 billion deployed, “to have that being a
negative story is amazing,” Zoellick told a panel discussion in
the Mexican resort of Los Cabos today. “It’s because the
execution was extremely poor.”  International Monetary Fund Managing Director  Christine
Lagarde  told the same panel that Spain needs to do more work
on formulating its request for aid.  “There’s clearly work in the making that need to be
done,” for instance in terms of giving exact numbers, Lagarde
said. The IMF will monitor the package, being “honest and
candid” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
