Castlebeck Care Ltd. is working with
financial advisers from  Grant Thornton  to consider a sale or
break-up of the group, the  Sunday Telegraph  reported, citing
four people it didnâ€™t identify.  A sale would see shareholders lose out, because the company
is valued at less than when Lydian Capital Partners bought it in
2006, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
