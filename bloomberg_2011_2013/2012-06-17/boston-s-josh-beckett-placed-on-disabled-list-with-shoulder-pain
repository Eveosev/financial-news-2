Boston Red Sox right-handed pitcher
 Josh Beckett , suffering from inflammation of his right shoulder,
was placed on the 15-day disabled list, General Manager Ben Cherington said.  Beckett, 32, has posted a 4.14 earned run average while
going 4-7 in 12 starts for the Red Sox this year.  “He’s got some inflammation that we’re going to calm down
and take the time, whatever time it takes to do it,” manager
 Bobby Valentine  told reporters yesterday. “We thought in
between starts was enough. He could have gotten an extra day or
two, I guess.”  The Major League Baseball team recalled pitcher Clayton Mortensen from Triple-A Pawtucket to take Beckett’s place on the
roster.  Mortensen, 27, will be in his second stint with  Boston  this
year. He posted a 0.96 ERA with 12 strikeouts and no walks in
three relief appearances for the Red Sox from May 2-9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
