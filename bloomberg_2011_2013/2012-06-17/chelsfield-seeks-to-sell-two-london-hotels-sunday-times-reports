Chelsfield Partners LLP is looking
to sell two hotels in  London  for about 170 million pounds ($266
million), the  Sunday Times  reported, without saying where it got
the information.  Chelsfield has hired Knight Frank LLP to handle the sale,
the newspaper said. The properties, which trade under the Club
Quarters brand, are near St. Paulâ€™s cathedral and Leadenhall
Market, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
