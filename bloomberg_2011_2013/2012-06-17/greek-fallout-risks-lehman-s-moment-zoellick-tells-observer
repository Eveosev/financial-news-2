The situation in Greece risks
triggering a global crisis similar to that following the
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., World Bank
President  Robert Zoellick  told the Observer.  “Europe may be able to muddle through but the risk is
rising,” Zoellick, who said he will present his warning to the
Group of 20 summit this week, told the newspaper in an
 interview . “There could be a Lehman’s moment if things are not
properly handled.”  Developing nations need to “prepare for the uncertainty
coming out of the euro zone and the wider financial markets,”
he said. “Uncertainty in markets is now starting to increase
costs for  developing countries .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
