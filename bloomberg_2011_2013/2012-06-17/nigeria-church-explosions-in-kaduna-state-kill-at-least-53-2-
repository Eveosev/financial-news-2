At least 53 people were killed in a
series of explosions that targeted churches around the Nigerian
cities of Zaria and Kaduna,  Shehu Sani , president of the Civil
Rights Congress, whose organization is helping in rescue
operations, said.  “The figure represents bodies counted by our members and
reports from people near where the blasts occurred,” Sani said
today. “We need figures from the hospitals to ascertain the
total number of victims.”  The Kaduna State government imposed a 24-hour curfew
following the attacks, Reuben Buhari, a spokesman for the
governor, said by phone.  Three blasts occurred in Zaria’s Wusasa and Sabon-Gari
districts and in Kaduna, Yushau Shuaib, a spokesman for the
National Emergency Management Agency, said by telephone. The
Kaduna state police confirmed two of the attacks.  “Two  suicide bombers  attacked two different churches in
Zaria this morning and many were killed and injured,” police
spokesman Aminu Lawan said by phone. He could not give exact
casualty numbers.  While no one has claimed responsibility, Nigerian
authorities have blamed a group called Boko Haram for previous
attacks in the mainly Muslim north and the capital Abuja that
have killed hundreds of people this year. Boko Haram is a
movement seeking to impose strict Islamic law in the country.  Nigeria ,  Africa ’s most populous nation and the continent’s
biggest oil producer, is roughly split between a mainly Muslim
north and predominantly Christian south.  To contact the reporters on this story:
