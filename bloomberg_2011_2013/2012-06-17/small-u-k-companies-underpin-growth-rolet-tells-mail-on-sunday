The U.K.â€™s small businesses underpin
economic growth because they create more jobs than large
companies or the government, London Stock Exchange Group Plc
Chief Executive Officer  Xavier Rolet  told the Mail on Sunday.  Out of 23 million small and medium-sized businesses in
Europe, 4.8 million are in the U.K., while 2.6 million are in
France, the newspaper said, citing Rolet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
