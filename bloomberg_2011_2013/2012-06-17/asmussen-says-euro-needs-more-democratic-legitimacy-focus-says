European Central Bank Executive
Board member Joerg Asmussen said  Europe  needs to create a
democratically-legitimate political union,  Focus  magazine
reported, citing an interview.  “In the course of the crisis we’ve lost a vision of the
future of Europe,” the magazine quoted Asmussen as saying.
Europe needs “stronger parliamentary control” through the
European Parliament, he was cited as saying.  Germany  should hold a referendum on giving more control to
the European Parliament, Asmussen told the magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
