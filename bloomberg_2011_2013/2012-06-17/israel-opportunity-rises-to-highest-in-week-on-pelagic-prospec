Israel Opportunity Energy Resources
LP (ISOPL)  advanced to the highest level in almost one week after a
report on the Pelagic offshore field identified a new prospect
that could include about 530 million barrels of oil.  The  shares  advanced 2.7 percent to 0.229 shekel, the
highest intraday level since June 11, at 11.44 a.m. in  Tel Aviv .  Israel Opportunity said the report gave a 12.3 percent
geological probability to the oil prospect and the field may
also include about 500 million barrels of condensate, according
to an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
