Relief pitcher Brad Lidge was
designed for assignment today by the  Washington Nationals  after
he gave up five runs in one inning in two appearances against
the  New York Yankees  this weekend.  Lidge, 35, who signed a one-year free-agent deal with the
Nationals, was a two-time All-Star in six seasons with the
Houston Astros and four with the  Philadelphia Phillies .  Lidge is 0-1 with two saves and a 9.64 ERA in 11
appearances this season with the Nationals. The Yankees scored
three runs against Lidge in one-third of an inning two days ago
and two runs in two-thirds of an inning yesterday. Lidge took
the loss in yesterday’s 5-3 defeat in 14 innings.  “Brad wasn’t performing well,” Washington General Manager
Mike Rizzo told reporters before today’s game against the
Yankees. “He was very disappointed.”  The Nationals reinstated reliever Ryan Mattheus from the
15-day disabled list to take Lidge’s roster spot. By designating
him for assignment,  Washington  has 10 days to either trade or
release Lidge.  Lidge went 48-for-48 in save opportunities during the
Phillies’ 2008 World Series championship season. Since then, he
has a record of 1-12, including an 0-8 record in 2009.  “The 14-inning game last night forced us to make a bullpen
roster move,” Rizzo said. “Mattheus was ready to come off his
rehab assignment, and we felt like this was the right time to
make the move.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
