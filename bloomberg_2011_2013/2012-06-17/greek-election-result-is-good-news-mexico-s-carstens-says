The Greek election outcome is good
news that may be well received by markets, Mexican Central Bank
Governor Agustin Carstens said.  “It’s good news in the sense that it will allow the
gradual strengthening of  Europe ,” Carstens told reporters in
the Mexican resort of Los Cabos today. “It appears to be news
that apparently goes in the same direction as the market
anticipated.”  Asked if the vote would have an effect on market
volatility, he said that  “we should not anticipate” any
reaction yet. “Let’s see what happens.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
