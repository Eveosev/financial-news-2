Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  is too posh and out of touch with the needs of ordinary
Britons, more than half of respondents in a ComRes Ltd poll for
the Independent on Sunday said.  The survey showed that 59 percent of survey participants
said Osborne is “out of touch with the public” and 55 percent
said he is “too posh to understand the financial pressures on
ordinary people.” The  Labour Party  was backed by 42 percent of
voters, compared with 32 percent for Prime Minister  David Cameron  and Osborne’s  Conservative Party .  Osborne and his party’s reputation was damaged by the March
21 budget in which he cut the top rate of income tax while
subjecting hot takeaway snacks such as Cornish pasties to value-
added tax and introduced other measures that hurt people on
lower incomes. Most of the increases were dropped a month later
and Labour called on the government to go further and drop plans
to cut the top rate of income tax next year to 45 percent from
50 percent.  ComRes interviewed 2,014 people online on June 13-15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
