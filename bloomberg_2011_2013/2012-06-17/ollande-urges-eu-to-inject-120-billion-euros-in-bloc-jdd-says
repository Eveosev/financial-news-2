French President  Francois Hollande 
called on the European Union to inject 120 billion euros ($152
billion) into the bloc’s economy by year-end to spur growth,  Le
Journal du Dimanche  reported, citing proposals sent June 14.  The suggestions may be incorporated into a broader plan to
build a more integrated euro area, for discussion at an EU
Council meeting on June 28-29, the newspaper said. All EU
nations were asked to send proposals to the EU presidency.  Hollande suggested the EU use a “large portion” of the 55
billion euros in unused structural funds, the newspaper said. He
also called on the EU to transfer 10 billion euros to the
 European Investment Bank  to give it leverage to borrow funds for
infrastructure projects, according to the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
