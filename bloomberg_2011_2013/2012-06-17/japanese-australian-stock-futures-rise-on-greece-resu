Japanese and Australian stock
futures rose as official projections showed parties that support
Greece’s bailout won enough seats to control parliament, easing
concern the euro currency bloc would lose one of its 17 members.  American Depositary Receipts  of  Canon Inc. (7751) , a Japanese
camera maker that depends on Europe for almost a third of its
sales, advanced 1 percent on June 15. ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,
the world’s largest mining company, climbed 0.9 percent  as
investors sought shares of companies with earnings tied to
economic growth. Those of  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a mining-equipment
maker, gained 1.3 percent in Tokyo.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
September gained 0.6 percent at 4 a.m. in Osaka, Japan. They
were bid in the pre-market at 8,690 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m., up
from the closing level of 8,560 on June 15. Futures on
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index advanced 0.6 percent today. New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.1 percent in Wellington. Futures
on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.4 percent today.  “ Greece ’s election is a good result and will provide some
short-term relief for sure,” said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-based
head of dynamic  asset allocation  at AMP Capital Investors Ltd.,
which manages almost $100 billion. “This will put to rest for a
little while the prospect of Greece leaving the euro. I’m
positive on risk and on equities, especially with valuations at
extreme cheapness and with very high chances of central banks
and authorities further easing monetary policy.”  Bailout Victory  Greece’s pro-bailout New Democracy and Pasok parties took
162 seats in the 300-member parliament, according to the
official projection by the  Interior Ministry  in Athens. The
results eased concern that Alex Tsipras’s Syriza party would
take control of the Greek government and reject austerity
measures needed to qualify for international aid.  The vote forced Greeks, in a fifth year of recession, to
choose open-ended austerity to stay in the euro or reject the
terms of a bailout and risk the turmoil of exiting the 17-nation
currency. The election threatened to dominate a summit of world
leaders in Mexico.  Leaders from the Group of 20 nations will boost the $430
billion firewall the  International Monetary Fund  announced in
April, host President  Felipe Calderon  said in Mexico. European
governments indicated a willingness to adjust the terms of
Greece’s bailout package as long as a new government “swiftly”
emerges from the closely fought election.  Biggest Declines  Concern  Europe ’s debt crisis would slow economies and
prompt bank losses has spurred the three biggest declines in
global equities since they reached a six-year low in March 2009.
The MSCI All-Country World Index tumbled 16 percent between
April and July 2010, fell 24 percent from May through October
2011, and has declined 9.3 percent since reaching a seven-month
high of 337.14 on March 19, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  About $5.5 trillion has been erased from share prices
around the world since March amid concern growth is slowing in
the U.S. and China, the world’s two largest economies, and as
Europe’s debt crisis intensified. The  MSCI Asia-Pacific (MXAP) , which
has lost 11 percent from this year’s highest level in February,
is trading at 1.2 times book value, compared with 2.1 times for
the S&P 500 and 1.3 times for the Stoxx 600, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A number below one means companies can be
bought for less than value of their assets.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies gained 1.3 percent last week, extending a 3.5
percent surge in the five days ended June 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
