Ken Morrison, former chief executive
of  William Morrison Supermarkets Plc (MRW) , the smallest of the U.K.’s
four main supermarket chains, told the  Sunday Telegraph  the
company’s management team risks losing touch with its customers.  He said management is “neglecting the core business” by
making the shops more upmarket, the newspaper reported. “You
can’t compete with everybody,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
