Sales at major South Korean
department stores rose last month as gift buying increased with
public holidays.  Outlays at the three largest chains increased 1 percent in
May from a year earlier, following a 3.4 percent decline in
April, the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said in a statement
today. Discount-store sales dropped 5.7 percent as prices of
fresh food rose and business hours of stores were shortened,
todayâ€™s report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
