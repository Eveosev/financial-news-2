Saudi Arabia  may purchase as many as
800 Leopard 2 battle tanks manufactured by German companies,
 Bild am Sonntag  reported, citing unidentified people close to
the German government.  The total value of the order could reach about 10 billion
euros ($12.6 billion), the newspaper reported. The deal could
secure the future of tank producers Krauss Maffei Wegmann and
Rheinmetall, Bild said.  The Saudi Defense Ministry couldnâ€™t be reached for comment
because it is closed for the day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
