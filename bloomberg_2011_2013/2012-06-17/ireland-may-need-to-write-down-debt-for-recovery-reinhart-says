Ireland and other “advanced
economies” may have to write down billions of euros in personal
and corporate debt before economic growth can return,  Carmen Reinhart  said in an interview with the  Sunday Business Post .  “To restore solvency and the confidence that you can grow

senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International
Economics in Washington, told the Dublin-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
