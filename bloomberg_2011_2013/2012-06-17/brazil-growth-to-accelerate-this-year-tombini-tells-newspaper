Brazil ’s economic growth will
accelerate this year and the country will start 2013 “at a
faster speed,” central bank President Alexandre Tombini said in
an interview with the newspaper  Correio Braziliense .  “There are factors that will support demand this year,
such as a strong labor market and wage gains,” Tombini told the
newspaper.  Still, maintaining business and  consumer confidence  is
important to keep contagion from the global economic slowdown
and the financial crisis in Europe from spreading, he said.
Brazil is prepared to react to any adverse effects of the crisis
on local markets, he added.  Tombini said the decision last week by Brazil’s finance
ministry to begin unwinding capital controls “came at the right
moment” and reflects the worsening of financing conditions on
international markets.  Brazil exempted foreign loans with a maturity of more than
two years from a 6 percent tax to help companies and banks roll
over foreign currency-denominated debt. The tax was one of a
series of measures taken during the past 19 months to weaken the
real and protect exporters from what President  Dilma Rousseff 
called a “monetary tsunami” unleashed by developed nations
seeking to devalue their currencies.  Tombini said no more adjustments are needed on the foreign-
exchange market to balance the system,
though the central bank will continue to monitor the currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
