Greece ’s New Democracy party opened
up a narrow lead in Greek elections today, receiving between
28.6 percent and 30 percent of the vote, final figures from an
exit poll forecast.  Anti-bailout party Syriza got between 27.5 percent and 28.4
percent, according to the exit poll, broadcast on state-run
television NET. Socialist Pasok is placing third with between 11
percent to 12.4 percent, according to the poll, which is based
on the reading from a full sample of 10,000 voter.  The results, if confirmed, may give Pasok and New Democracy
enough support for them to team up to form a government with a
majority of 159 seats in the 300-seat Greek parliament.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
