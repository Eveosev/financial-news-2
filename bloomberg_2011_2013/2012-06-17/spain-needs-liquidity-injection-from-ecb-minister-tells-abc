Spanish Deputy Minister for European
Affairs Inigo Mendez de Vigo said countries including Spain need
a liquidity injection from the  European Central Bank , according
to an interview in  ABC .  The government’s last overhaul of the banking industry,
which increased provisions for losses, may not have been
sufficient as some banks weren’t able to make those provisions,
Mendez de Vigo told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
