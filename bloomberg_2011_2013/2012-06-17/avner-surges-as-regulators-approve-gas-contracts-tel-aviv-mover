Avner Oil Exploration LLP (AVNRL)  and  Delek
Drilling-LP (DEDRL) , partners in the Tamar natural gas field, surged
after gas contracts with electricity producers were approved
with some amendments by regulators.  Avner gained 5.8 percent, the most since Oct. 10, to 2.148
shekels at 1:30 p.m. in Tel Aviv. Delek Drilling  advanced  5.1
percent, the most since March 14, to 12.03 shekels.  Isramco
Negev 2 LP (ISRAL) , another partner in the field, rose 4.5 percent to
0.49 shekel. The benchmark TA-25 index gained 1.4 percent.  Israel’s Antitrust Authority and the Public Utility
Authority-Electricity approved the gas contracts between the
partners in the Tamar gas field and Israel Electric Corp. and
other private electricity producers with changes, including the
terms of the option to increase the gas supply and adjustments
to the price mechanism.  “Everybody was worried the regulators wouldn’t approve the
long-term contracts,” David Kaplan, a Tel Aviv-based analyst at
 Barclays Plc. (BARC)  said. “The approvals remove uncertainty and will
allow the companies to complete the financing necessary to
further develop the Tamar project.”  The partners in Tamar signed a 15-year agreement in March
to supply gas to Israel Electric, the state-owned power
distributor.  Paz Oil Co. (PZOL) , a manufacturer of petroleum-based
products, said in April a unit signed a $700-million 15-year
accord to buy natural gas from the Tamar partnership.  To contact the reporter on this story:
