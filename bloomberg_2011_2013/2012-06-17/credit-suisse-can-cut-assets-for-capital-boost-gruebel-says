Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  can trim its
balance sheet to boost its capital ratios, former  UBS AG (UBSN)  Chief
Executive Oswald Gruebel was quoted as saying, after the Swiss
National Bank said the bank needs a “marked increase” in
capital this year to prepare for a possible worsening of
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  “Shareholders are worried that Credit Suisse will have to
undertake a capital increase, a step which would have negative
consequences for the share price,” Gruebel was quoted as saying
in Switzerland’s Der Sonntag. “But they also have the option to
indirectly boost capital by reducing the size of their balance
sheet,” or pursue both options, Gruebel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
