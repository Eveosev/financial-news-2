Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , Japan’s second-
largest carmaker, will overcome a slowdown in deliveries of its
all-electric Leaf vehicle, doubling U.S. sales to 20,000 during
its current fiscal year, the vice chairman of its U.S. unit
said.  A new plant in Smyrna,  Tennessee , will be ready to
make the cars in December, helping boost supply before
the fiscal year ends in March, Nissan’s  Bill Krueger  said in an
interview yesterday in Los Cabos, Mexico, where he was visiting
for the B-20 business summit. The automaker also is expanding
sales nationally after beginning in seven states, he said.  Leaf sales have dropped the past two months, trailing
 General Motors Co. (GM) ’s rechargeable Chevrolet Volt and  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203) ’s plug-in Prius in May. Volt deliveries more than
tripled to 1,680 units in May, while Leaf sales fell 55 percent
to 510. The Leaf is made in a single plant in Japan.  “We’ve had to fulfill demand from one plant globally,”
Krueger said. “Once we localize it in December, the second half
of the fiscal year is when we’ll see most of the supply, demand
be available.”  Japan’s three largest automakers are producing vehicles in
 North America  at a rate indicating each will set records this
year.  Nissan made 1.18 million in the U.S. and Mexico last year,
its highest volume to date, and may make as many as 1.35 million
at the current rate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
