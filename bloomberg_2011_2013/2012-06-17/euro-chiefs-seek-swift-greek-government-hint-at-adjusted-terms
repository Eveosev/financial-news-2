European governments indicated a
willingness to adjust the terms of  Greece ’s bailout package as
long as a new government “swiftly” emerges from today’s
closely fought election.  Greece’s international monitors will “return to  Athens  as
soon as a new government is in place to exchange views with the
new government on the way forward,” euro-area finance ministers
said in an e-mailed  statement  in Brussels tonight. The ministers
sought “the swift formation of a new Greek government that will
take ownership of the adjustment program.”  With the 17-nation currency’s future on the line, finance
ministers pledged to assist Greece in its struggle with the
cycle of austerity and recession that has trapped the country
since it became the first victim of the debt crisis in 2010.  Finance ministers didn’t explicitly offer Greece extra time
to meet deficit-reduction targets, a concession already made to
 Spain . The tilt away from the German-inspired budget-cutting
prescriptions that have dominated the crisis response gained
further momentum today when French President  Francois Hollande ’s
Socialist allies romped in parliamentary elections.  The panel of finance ministers noted “the considerable
efforts already made by the Greek citizens and is convinced that
continued fiscal and structural reforms are Greece’s best
guarantee to overcome the current economic and social challenges
and for a more prosperous future of Greece in the euro area.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
