George Stathakis, who could become
 Greece ’s finance minister if the Syriza wins today’s election,
told the  Sunday Telegraph  that the party wants to stay in the
euro, but will renege on some of the conditions of the country’s
bailout.  “ Germany  will have to invent a way to throw us out of the
euro zone,” he said in an interview with the newspaper. “There
are three or four elements” of the bailout “that we would stop
at once.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
