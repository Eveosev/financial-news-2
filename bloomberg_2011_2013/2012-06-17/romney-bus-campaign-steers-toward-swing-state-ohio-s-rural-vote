Winding his way across eastern and
midwest states on a bus, Republican  Mitt Romney  is steering
around distractions to his message that President  Barack Obama 
has mismanaged the  U.S. economy .  The presumptive Republican nominee is spending today,
Father’s Day, in Ohio, where he’ll campaign with two of his sons
and Ohio Republican and U.S. House Speaker  John Boehner .  Romney’s interview with CBS’s “Face the Nation,” taped
yesterday, also is scheduled for broadcast today. It’s the
former Massachusetts governor’s first national Sunday morning
news show interview this election on a network other than Fox.  Yesterday, Romney rode through eastern Pennsylvania,
promising to boost the economy with a friendly regulatory
climate for energy jobs and industry. He avoided a firm stance
on immigration policy and detoured away from protesters and
Obama supporters.  In campaign stops, he offered no alternative position to
Obama’s announcement on June 15 of a policy that would prevent
deportation of illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as
children. Romney also switched a planned campaign stop from one
 Wawa  convenience store, where he’d planned to sample the popular
sandwiches, to another nearby after former  Pennsylvania  Governor
 Ed Rendell , a Democrat and Obama campaigner, and anti-Romney
protesters showed up at the first location.  Economic Message  “The president wants to talk about the economy a little --
not as much as I want to talk about the economy,” Romney told
the hundreds of people gathered yesterday at the Weatherly
Casting and Machine Co. in Weatherly, his first stop of the day.
Obama’s recent comment that the private sector was “doing
fine” runs counter to what business people say, Romney said.  While “hope and change” was Obama’s 2008 campaign slogan,
Romney said, “Now I think he’d like to change it to ‘Hoping to
Change the Subject.’”  Romney veered briefly from the economy message yesterday
while speaking via satellite to the Faith and Freedom
Coalition’s annual conference in Washington.  He said the U.S. should help arm those in  Syria  fighting
against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad “by encouraging
our friends there, like the Turks and the Saudis, to provide
weapons to the insurgents.”  Romney also suggested Obama wasn’t sufficiently tough on
Iran to prevent it from obtaining nuclear weapons.  Rural Backdrop  Romney’s stop at the Weatherly foundry and machine shop,
which employs 74 people, came on the second day of his six-
state, “Every Town Counts” bus tour through rural areas of
states that Obama won in 2008. He began the tour in  New
Hampshire , and after Ohio will move to Wisconsin, Iowa and
Michigan.  Mary Dunn, 60, a furniture store owner, said she looks to
Romney to bring more jobs to “a very depressed area.”  “The mines, the factories, they’re gone,” she said.  Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett, a Republican who
attended the Romney event in Cornwall, said while Pennsylvania
is “not an easy state” for Romney to win, “it is winnable.”
If Romney prevailed there, he would almost certainly win the
election, Corbett said. While registered Democrats outnumber
Republicans in the state, Obama’s track record since is “not
appealing” to many who supported him in 2008, he said.  Swing States  Pennsylvania, with 20 electoral votes of the 270 a
candidate needs to win the presidency in November, has leaned
toward Democrats.  Obama won the state in 2008 with 54 percent of the vote and
President  George W. Bush ’s challenger, Democrat  John Kerry , won
the state with 51 percent in 2004.  Ohio , with 18 electoral votes, may be a closer contest.
Obama won Ohio four years ago with 52 percent of the vote, while
Bush won Ohio with 51 percent in 2004.  Ohio ranked fifth on the Bloomberg Economic Evaluation of
States Index when assessed from the start of 2009.  The state through May added back 157,300 jobs of the
