Greece ’s parliamentary election
doesn’t ease the euro area’s crisis because voters failed to
give clear support to the shared currency,  Bild , Germany’s most-
read newspaper, said in an editorial.  “Far too many Greeks voted for the leftist party that is
taking them for a ride,” Bild said, referring to Syriza, which
rejects the terms of Greece’s bailout. “In truth, Greece is a
developing country. It has no economic basis, no administration
worthy of the name and still no plan for changing that.”  “Nobody can draw any clear conclusions from a slim
majority, neither in  Athens  nor in the rest of  Europe ,” Bild
said in an e-mailed editorial for tomorrow’s edition. Greece’s
election “split and paralyzed the country and doesn’t help the
euro out of the crisis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
