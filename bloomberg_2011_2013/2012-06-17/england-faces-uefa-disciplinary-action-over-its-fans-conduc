European soccer’s ruling body UEFA
said it opened disciplinary proceedings against the Football
Association for the “inappropriate” conduct of England
supporters at the Euro 2012 game against  Sweden  two days ago.  The case concerns an attempted pitch invasion by
England supporters during the Group D match in Kiev, UEFA said.  England came back from 2-1 down to win the match 3-2.  UEFA said  its control and disciplinary body will deal with
the case on June 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
