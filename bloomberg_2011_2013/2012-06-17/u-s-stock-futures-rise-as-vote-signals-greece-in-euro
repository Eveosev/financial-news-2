Most U.S. stocks advanced, sending
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index higher for a third day, as
optimism about Greece’s attempts to form a coalition government
tempered concern about a surge in Spanish bond yields.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , the world’s most valuable company, added 2
percent to pace gains in technology shares.  D.R. Horton  Inc. and
 Lennar Corp. (LEN)  climbed at least 3.9 percent as confidence among
homebuilders rose to a five-year high.  Facebook Inc. (FB)  rallied 4.7
percent in the one-month anniversary of its initial public
offering. Energy and financial shares in the S&P 500 declined.  Ten stocks gained for every nine falling on U.S. exchanges
at 4 p.m. New York time. The S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent to
1,344.78, after dropping 0.6 percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  lost 25.35 points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,741.82. The
Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.8 percent to 2,895.33. Trading
volume for exchange-listed stocks in the U.S. was about 5.8
billion shares, 13 percent below the three-month average.  “We managed not to drive off the cliff in Greece, but we
still got flat tires,” said  Alan Gayle , a senior strategist at
RidgeWorth Capital Management in Richmond, Virginia, which
oversees about $47 billion. “The challenges in Spain are very
much in front of us. There’s not a lot of conviction.”  Equities rebounded as Antonis Samaras, leader of Greece’s
New Democracy party, said he had a constructive discussion with
Democratic Left leader Fotis Kouvelis. German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s said Greece shouldn’t be granted leeway on terms for
its bailout. Group of 20 chiefs began a two-day meeting as
Spain’s borrowing costs soared to a euro-era record. Policy
makers are discussing ways to stimulate the economy if
necessary, a Canadian official said.  Builder Confidence  Federal Reserve policy makers meet June 19-20 to discuss
whether more U.S. stimulus is need. The National Association of
Home Builders/Wells Fargo  confidence index  rose to 29, the
highest since May 2007, from a revised 28 in May that was lower
than first estimated, a report from the Washington-based group
showed today. The gauge exceeded the median estimate of 28 in a
Bloomberg News survey.  “It’s somewhat tenuous at this juncture,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist for Philadelphia-based
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, which manages about $54 billion.
“With the G-20 meeting going on and the Fed policy meeting this
week, investors are somewhat hesitant.”  Concern about a global slowdown and a worsening of Europe’s
debt crisis put the  S&P 500  on the brink of a so-called
correction this month. It fell 9.9 percent from an almost four-
year high in April through June 1. Since then, the lowest
valuation in  six months  and bets on global policy action drove
the measure up 5.2 percent.  Biggest Gains  Eight out of  10 groups  in the S&P 500 rose as consumer
discretionary and technology shares had the biggest gains. Apple
jumped 2 percent to $585.78. A measure of  homebuilders  in S&P
indexes gained 3.5 percent. D.R. Horton increased 3.9 percent to
$16.50. Lennar climbed 4.1 percent to $26.97.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against S&P 500
losses, tumbled 13 percent to 18.32, the lowest since May 3.  Facebook, which last week had the first weekly advance
since its initial public offering, rose 4.7 percent to $31.41.
The shares have jumped 15 percent in three days.  Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  rallied 11 percent to $11.15. The largest
daily coupon website advanced after  Morgan Stanley (MS)  analysts
upgraded the stock to overweight from equalweight, citing
international sales opportunities.  EBay Surges  EBay Inc. (EBAY)  rallied 4.5 percent to $42.49. The world’s
largest Internet marketplace was rated outperform in new
coverage at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc.  Solar manufacturers led by LDK Solar Co. and  First Solar (FSLR) 
Inc. rallied as Japan approved subsidies that will encourage at
least $9.6 billion in new installations in the country. U.S.
shares of Xinyu, China-based LDK climbed 1.8 percent to $2.21.
Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar, the world’s largest maker of
thin-film panels, gained 3.7 percent to $14.47.  A measure of  energy (S5ENRS)  shares in the S&P 500 fell 0.8 percent,
the most among 10 groups, as oil slumped amid a stronger  U.S.
dollar .  Halliburton Co. (HAL) , the world’s largest provider of
hydraulic-fracturing services, declined 1.7 percent to $28.96.
Morgan Stanley, owner of the world’s largest brokerage, slumped
3.4 percent to $13.82 to pace losses in financial companies.  SAIC Inc. (SAI)  declined 3.1 percent to $11.86 after losing its
largest government contract to  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  Bethesda,
Maryland-based Lockheed on June 15 beat SAIC for a $1.91
billion, seven-year Defense Department contract to operate a
communications network known as the Global Information Grid.  Body Central  Body Central Corp. (BODY)  plunged 49 percent to $8.22, the lowest
ever. The operator of almost 250 women’s clothing stores cut its
second-quarter profit forecast amid declining sales at
established stores.  DSW Inc. (DSW)  slumped 11 percent to $52.13 after the shoe
retailer’s second-quarter profit forecast trailed estimates.  The  largest U.S. companies  are beating the average stock in
the S&P 500 by the most in more than a decade, fueled by rising
dividends, valuations 31 percent below the historical average
and fear.  Companies in the S&P 100 from Apple to  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  have gained 7.7 percent in 2012,  compared  with 5.1 percent
for a version of the S&P 500 that strips out weightings for
market value, the widest margin since 1999, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. With  price-earnings ratios  down 6.6 percent this
quarter to 12.7 and payouts at 2.2 percent of share prices,
analysts raised buy recommendations for the group to the highest
level since 2007.  Corporate Resilience  The biggest stocks are showing corporate America’s
resilience even though  Mitt Romney , the presumptive Republican
candidate in this year’s national election, criticized President
 Barack Obama  earlier this month for saying the private sector is
“doing fine.” A second year of record profits is helping the
S&P 100 beat every developed market index in the world as
investors seek the relative safety of the U.S. after $5.1
trillion was erased from global equities since March 27.  “The mega-caps are just cheap compared to other segments
of the stock market,”  Russ Koesterich , the San Francisco-based
global chief investment strategist for the IShares unit of
BlackRock Inc., said in a June 14 phone interview. His firm
oversees $3.68 trillion. “There are a lot of things that are
wrong in the economy, to state the obvious, and these are
companies that have the wherewithal to survive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
