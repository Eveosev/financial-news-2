Aroop Chatterjee, a currency
strategist at Barclays Plc’s Barclays Capital unit in New York
comments after a final exit poll showed  Greece ’s two largest
pro-bailout parties, New Democracy and Pasok, won enough seats
to forge a parliamentary majority.  “A New Democracy-led coalition would be consistent with a
reduction of probabilities around a Greek exit. It would be a
mild risk positive in our view since the euro crisis has moved
on from Greece to other peripheral countries like  Spain .”  “We continue to think the pressure on the euro will be
lower as weak growth will imply continued monetary policy easing
by the ECB in the future. There has been some knee-jerk buying,
which may have more to go. We would prefer to fade the rally
than buying into it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
