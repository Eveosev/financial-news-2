What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open on the  Chicago  Board
of Trade at 6 a.m. Singapore time.  -- Corn futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT after prices had the biggest weekly loss since
September on June 15 and early indications of polling in Greece
showed the two largest pro-bailout parties winning enough seats
to forge a parliamentary majority, according to Paul Deane, an
analyst at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)   -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago on expectations of pre-emptive speculative buying as
the risk of a broader market sell-off from the Greek elections
lessens, Deane said in an e-mail.  -- Wheat futures may open unchanged on mixed conditions in  North
America  with wet weather in parts of Canada and good conditions
in the U.S. spring-wheat crop, Deane said.  To contact the reporter for this story: Phoebe Sedgman in
