The U.K. government will announce a
1 billion-pound ($1.56 billion) order of nuclear reactors for
submarines from  Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR/) , the  Sunday Telegraph 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  A Rolls-Royce plant in Derby, northern England, will get
the contract to build the reactors, creating at least 300 jobs,
the newspaper said. The announcement will be made by Defense
Secretary Philip Hammond in the next few days, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
