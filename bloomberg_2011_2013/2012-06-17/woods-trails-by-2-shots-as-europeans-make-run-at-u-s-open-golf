Jim Furyk  holds a one-shot lead over
 Webb Simpson  in the final round of the  U.S. Open  at the foggy
Olympic Club in San Francisco.  Furyk, 42, who won the 2003 U.S. Open, began the day tied
with Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland for the lead at 1 under
par and is at even par after shooting 1 over through nine holes
today.  Simpson, 26, had four birdies in a five-hole span to jump
into second place at 1 over. He is playing in his second U.S.
Open, having finished 14th last year.  Americans Michael Thompson and John Peterson are at 2 over
in fog and 18 mile-an-hour (29 kilometer-per-hour) wind.  McDowell and Ernie Els of  South Africa  are among four
players at 3 over. Els, who won the U.S. Open in 1994 and 1997,
moved into contention today with a 10-foot eagle putt on the
seventh hole.  Furyk had his only bogey of the day at the par-4 sixth.  Furyk, McDowell and Els all are former U.S. Open champions.
Furyk, an American, won in 2003 at Olympia Fields south of
Chicago. McDowell won in 2010 at Pebble Beach, about 114 miles
(184 kilometers) south of the Olympic Club along California’s
Pacific Coast.  Tiger Woods , who was tied for the lead entering the third
round, trails Furyk by eight shots and is two strokes behind 17-
year-old Beau Hossler, an amateur from Southern  California  who
hasn’t yet started his final year in high school.  Woods, who is trying to end a four-year winless drought in
major championships, is 4 over through 16 holes today.  Amateur Leader  Hossler, who briefly held the tournament lead in the second
round, is 3 over through 13 holes in the final round and 6 over
for the tournament. He was tied for eighth entering today’s play,
the first amateur in the top 10 after 54 holes since Matt Kuchar
was tied for 10th at the 1998 U.S. Open, also at the Olympic
Club.  Five-time U.S. Open runner-up  Phil Mickelson , who turned 42
yesterday, shot an 8-over 78 in the fourth round and finished
the tournament at 16 over.  “If you played anything less than perfect golf it was
extremely penalizing, and I played far from perfect,” Mickelson
told reporters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
