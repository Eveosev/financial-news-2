Cellcom Israel Ltd. (CEL)  rallied the most
in almost two weeks on investor bets this year’s decline in
Israel’s largest mobile-phone company was overdone.  The  shares  advanced 4.7 percent, the most since June 4, to
28.16 shekels at 3:58 p.m. in Tel Aviv, taking this year’s
decline to 56 percent. Cellcom trades at a multiple of 5.55
times estimated earnings, compared with 10.4 times for the
benchmark TA-25 Index.  “At these levels some investors feel the shares are
cheap,” said Gilad Alper, a senior analyst at Excellence
Nessuah Investment House Ltd. in  Ramat Gan .  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government introduced
regulations for mobile providers and holding companies to boost
competition in the industry. Cellcom said last month first-
quarter net income dropped 43 percent to 173 million shekels
($45 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
