Germany ’s small- and medium-sized
companies, the so-called Mittelstand, will drive  Europe ’s
economy this year and growth will be stronger than some
economists predict, according to the country’s DSGV savings
banks association.  “The German Mittelstand will be the economic locomotive in
2013 in Europe,” DSGV President Georg Fahrenschon said in a
speech in Frankfurt today, referring to the companies that
generate about half of Germany’s gross domestic product. Last
year “was better than expected and 2013 will be better than
feared,” he said. “We don’t see a bad fourth quarter causing
sustained uncertainty.”  The German government forecasts economic growth will slow
to 0.4 percent this year from 0.7 percent in 2012 as austerity
policies in cash-strapped euro-region countries and cooling
world trade damp exports. The  European Central Bank  predicts the
17-nation euro economy will contract 0.3 percent, with countries
such as Spain and  Italy  mired in recessions.  Fahrenschon said he expects higher growth rates than some
economists because European states have become more competitive
and German companies plan to make investments.  The countries that share the euro must continue budget
consolidation efforts to “stabilize” the currency, said
Fahrenschon, a former finance minister in the state of Bavaria.  The ECB must also “begin to exit the low interest-rate
phase in the foreseeable future” as the current situation
reduces incentives for governments to cut spending and for
consumers to save money for their future, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
