PPS Pipeline Systems GmbH of  Germany 
won’t seek to delay a project to link Lithuania’s liquefied
natural-gas terminal to its distribution network after losing a
bid for its construction.  PPS Pipeline Systems filed a complaint with Lithuania’s
Procurement Office after state-controlled  Klaipedos Nafta AB (KNF1L) ,
which is building the LNG terminal on the  Baltic Sea , last month
picked a group including Kauno Dujotiekio Statyba AB and Siauliu
Dujotiekio Statyba UAB to build the 20-kilometer (21.8-mile)
pipeline link for 138 million litai ($53 million).  PPS asked Klaipeda District Court to determine whether the
Lithuanian group that won the tender had an unlawful advantage,
the Quakenbruck, Germany-based company said in an e-mailed
statement distributed by public relations company VRT today.  “We don’t ask for temporary restraining measures that
could stop the tender,” Peter Legler, managing director at PPS
Pipeline Systems, said in the statement. “PPS Pipeline Systems
has no desire to obstruct the LNG terminal project.”  Lithuania’s plan to start operating a floating LNG terminal
on the Baltic Sea coast in late 2014 is the core of a strategy
to reduce reliance on OAO Gazprom and convince the Russian gas
company to reduce its prices. Energy terminal operator Klaipedos
Nafta in March signed an agreement with  Hoegh LNG (HLNG)  to lease a
terminal that Hoegh is now building.  To contact the reporter on this story:
