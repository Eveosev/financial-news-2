Serbia’s government must adopt a
medium-term framework for regulated prices and allow only
moderate public wage and pension increases to slow inflation and
ensure macroeconomic stability, the central bank said.  The inflation rate reached 12.2 percent in December, more
than double the upper end of the central bank’s target band of
2.5 percent and 5.5 percent, the Belgrade-based Narodna Banka
Srbije said in a letter to Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic , published
on its website today.  Considering “the nature of current inflationary
pressures” is determined by food-cost instability, the
government should take immediate measures to stabilize the
market and lower the volatility of food prices, according to the
 letter , signed by Governor Jorgovanka Tabakovic.  It’s “exceptionally important” that the government
determines a medium-term framework for regulated price
adjustments, as well as maintaining planned public wage and
pension policies to make the monetary policy “more efficient,”
she said in the letter.  The central bank expects inflation to start slowing from
the second quarter of this year and return to the target of 4
percent plus or minus 1.5 percentage points by the end of 2013.  The National Bank of  Serbia , which has raised  borrowing
costs  seven times since last June by a total of 200 basis points
to 11.5 percent, said the “full effects of monetary- policy
measures on inflation have yet to manifest” and we will
“assess in the coming period whether any additional monetary
policy tightening is required to ensure the return of inflation
to the target in the medium-term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
