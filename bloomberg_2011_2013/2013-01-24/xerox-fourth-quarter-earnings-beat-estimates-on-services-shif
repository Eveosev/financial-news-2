Xerox Corp. (XRX) , the provider of
document and business services, rose the most in three weeks as
earnings beat analyst projections, thanks to a shift away from
the traditional printing business.  Profit excluding some items fell to 30 cents a share from
33 cents a year earlier, above the average analyst  estimate  of
29 cents. Xerox, based in Norwalk, Connecticut, reiterated its
full-year forecast for earnings per share of 94 cents to $1, and
adjusted profit of $1.09 to $1.15.  Xerox climbed 2.2 percent to $7.75 at the close in New
York, the most since Jan. 2. The shares slipped 14 percent last
year, compared with a 13 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index.  Xerox has been automating payments for governments and
processing claims for insurers in a bid to expand its services
business to two-thirds of revenue by 2017, from about half
today. Chief Executive Officer  Ursula Burns  is moving away from
printing as customers increasingly view their documents on
computers and mobile devices.  “I like the move to services, and they need to show that
they can grow there even with increasing competition,” said
Dylan Cathers, an analyst with  S&P Capital IQ (KCE)  in New York, who
has a sell rating on the stock. “The printer business is a
shrinking business -- there’s no two ways about it.”  Profit Drops  Fourth-quarter net income fell to $335 million from $375
million a year earlier, Xerox said. Sales were $5.92 billion,
compared with $5.96 billion a year earlier.  Fourth-quarter earnings were hurt by $93 million for
restructuring costs as Xerox fired 2,500 workers. Competitors
including  Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC)  and  Accenture Plc (ACN)  are getting
more aggressive, making Burns’s strategic plan tougher, Cathers
said. Printer maker  Lexmark International Inc. (LXK)  is also working
on a move to services.  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) , the market leader,
said this week that fourth-quarter contract signings for
services fell 12 percent from a year earlier to $17.9 billion,
while outsourcing bookings were down 28 percent to $8.3 billion.  Mark Loughridge, IBM’s chief financial officer, said sales
in the consulting unit known as Global Business Services will
improve this year after falling 4 percent to $18.6 billion in
2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
