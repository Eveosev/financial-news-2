American Airlines  signed a 12-year
agreement for  Republic Airways Holdings Inc. (RJET)  to operate 76-seat
regional jets, the first such agreement in the  AMR Corp . unit’s
history.  Fifty-three Embraer SA E-175 jets operated by Republic will
be phased into service at two to three planes a month beginning
in mid-2013 through the first quarter of 2015, the airlines said
in statements today.  The accord is part of American’s efforts to diversify
suppliers of commuter flights beyond its American Eagle unit and
to add larger regional jets that are more economical to operate
at higher fuel prices. American, based in  Fort Worth , Texas, was
exploring a spinoff of Eagle when it filed for bankruptcy in
November 2011.  Republic also said it agreed to purchase 47 new aircraft
from Brazilian plane maker  Embraer (EMBR3)  and lease a previously owned
E-175. It also will acquire five E-175s from an unnamed third
party. Embraer’s contract with Indianapolis-based Republic
includes options for another 47 aircraft orders.  Eagle has been limited to operating 47 Bombardier CRJ-700
regional jets with 65 seats for American by the larger carrier’s
contract with its pilots union. Concessions made as the labor
agreement was renegotiated in bankruptcy allow for more of the
bigger jets to be flown for American.  To contact the reporter on this story:
