The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission delayed a ruling on Nasdaq Stock Market’s proposal to
compensate brokers that lost money in the initial public
offering of  Facebook Inc. (FB)  in May.  The SEC needs more time to review Nasdaq’s payment plan and
comment letters, the regulator said in a  notice  today on its
website. The new deadline is March 29, it said. The SEC has
received six additional letters and a second response letter
from Nasdaq since it last extended the deadline on Oct. 26,
according to the filing.  The operator of the second-largest U.S. equity exchange
increased a plan to pay brokers for losses incurred because the
exchange’s so-called opening cross, which sets the first traded
price for Facebook, failed to operate properly on May 18,
according to a July proposal.  The exchange’s failure to disseminate confirmations about
orders submitted into that opening cross for more than two hours
led to investor and brokerage confusion about transactions and
prevented them from taking actions to reduce their risks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
