Rubber rallied from the lowest level
in a week as data showed  China ’s manufacturing is expanding at
the fastest rate in two years, raising speculation demand from
the world’s largest user will improve.  The contract for delivery in June gained 0.2 percent to 309
yen a kilogram ($3,482 a metric ton) at 11:26 a.m. after
dropping to 306.1 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, the
lowest level since Jan. 18. Futures added 2.2 percent this year.  The preliminary reading of a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was
51.9 in January, according to a statement from HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics today. That compares with the 51.5 final
reading for December and the 51.7 median estimate of 17 analysts
surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  “The data added to expectations that China’s growth will
accelerate this year, leading to stronger demand for raw
materials,”  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at broker Fujitomi Co.
in Tokyo, said by phone today.  The data suggest China’s economic growth at the start of
2013 will equal or exceed its 7.9 percent clip in the fourth
quarter, reducing the likelihood that the nation’s new
leadership headed by Xi Jinping will roll out additional
measures to support expansion.  Rubber for delivery in May dropped 1.3 percent to 25,735
 yuan  ($4,135) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai
rubber free-on-board dropped 0.2 percent to 98.55 baht ($3.30) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
