Argentina ’s  industrial production 
last year contracted for the first time since 2002, reflecting
slowing exports and manufacturing bottlenecks caused by import
restrictions on supplies.  Factory output shrank 1.2 percent from 2011, the first
contraction since a 10.6 percent decline in 2002 after the
country defaulted on $95 billion of bonds and abandoned a
decade-old currency peg that fixed the peso at par with the
dollar.  In December, output fell 3.4 percent from a year earlier
and 0.6 percent from November, the national statistics agency
reported today. The year-on-year contraction compares with the
median estimate of a 0.2 percent drop by eight economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  South America’s second-biggest economy probably expanded as
much as 2 percent last year, the smallest growth since 2009,
according to Alberto Bernal, the head of fixed-income research
at Bulltick Capital Markets in Miami.  The country’s trade surplus widened in 2012 to $12.7
billion from $10 billion the previous year. Exports fell 3
percent after drought cut corn and soybean crops, while demand
from  Brazil , the country’s biggest trade partner, waned. Imports
dropped 7 percent, the institute reported yesterday.  “Growth will accelerate to about 4 percent this year
because a bigger harvest will boost exports and Brazilian
industry will improve, helping Argentina,” Bernal said in a
telephone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
