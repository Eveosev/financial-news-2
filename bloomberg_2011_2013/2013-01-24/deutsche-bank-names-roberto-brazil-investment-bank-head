Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Germany’s largest
lender, named Joel Roberto head of  investment banking  in Brazil
to replace Jaime Singer.  Singer is leaving “to pursue personal projects,” a
spokeswoman for the Frankfurt-based company said, asking not to
be identified in keeping with company policy. Roberto’s
promotion will “keep strengthening the business in Brazil,”
she said.  Roberto, 46, has worked for Deutsche Bank since 2010, and
was a managing director responsible for client relationships in
sectors including infrastructure, telecommunications, media,
logistics, technology and conglomerates. He was previously a
banker at Banco Santander Brasil SA and ABN Amro Bank NV and an
attorney at Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP.  Deutsche Bank cut employees in its Brazilian investment
bank and research units last month as part of a global effort to
save 4.5 billion euros ($6 billion) by 2015. The company, which
has about 500 employees in Brazil including workers from
outsourcing services, didn’t say how many jobs were eliminated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
