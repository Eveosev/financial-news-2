Idemitsu Kosan Co. (5019) , a Japanese
refiner, set up a venture with partners for wood biomass power
generation.  Idemitsu will take a 50 percent stake in the venture and
Tosa Electric Railway Co. and Kochi Prefecture Federation of
Forest Owners’ Cooperative Associations will hold a 25 percent
stake each, they said in a statement yesterday.  The venture plans to “advance studies of entry to the wood
biomass power-generation business” to build a 5-megawatt
station in Kochi prefecture in southwestern  Japan , according to
the statement.  The group wants to start operations of the plant in April
2015 and plans to use fuel consisting of 100 percent unused wood
materials, the three parties said, without detailing how much
the plant will cost.  To contact the reporter on this story:
