Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNE) , a Calgary-based
 oil company  that operates in Colombia, rallied to its highest
level in two months after announcing a discovery in the central
part of the country.  Shares rose 1.7 percent to 6,510 pesos at 1:31 p.m. in
Bogota after earlier gaining as much as 3.4 percent to the
highest intraday level since Nov. 2. Canacol, which fell 57
percent in 2012, has gained 15 percent this year, the most on
the  Colcap. (COLCAP)  The index rose 0.4 percent today and is up 1.7
percent this year.  An exploration well in central Colombia confirmed an oil
discovery in a shallow reservoir and “very encouraging signs”
from a deeper formation, Chief Executive Officer Charle Gamba
said in today in a statement. In December the company announced
an oil discovery in eastern  Colombia .  “It’s really a turnaround story,” Justin Anderson, an
analyst at Salman Partners, said in a telephone interview from
Calgary. “Cash-flow and balance-sheet risk is being reduced
substantially by these near-term discoveries, and on the other
side they are proving and strengthening the case that these
unconventional blocks are world-class.”  Shares dropped last year as declining production at a field
led to concern about the company’s liquidity, Anderson said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
