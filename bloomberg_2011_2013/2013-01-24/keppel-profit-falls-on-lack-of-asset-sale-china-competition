Keppel Corp. (KEP) , the world’s largest
oil-rig maker, posted a 22 percent decline in fourth-quarter
profit because of smaller contribution from its property unit
and rising competition from Chinese shipbuilders.  Net income dropped to S$305 million ($249 million) in the
three months ended Dec. 31 from S$389 million a year earlier,
the company said in a statement to the Singapore stock exchange
today. Sales climbed 7.1 percent to S$3 billion.  Keppel won S$10 billion of contracts last year and the
company has a net order book of S$12.8 billion, according to the
statement. Deliveries stretch out to 2019, it said.  Oil
companies  are boosting spending on new equipment because of
higher crude prices and declining reserves.  The  rig-maker  gained 0.4 percent to close at S$11.34 in
Singapore trading before the earnings announcement.  The company signed a $4.1 billion order in August to build
five semi-submersible rigs for Sete Brasil Participacoes SA, an
affiliate of  Brazil ’s state-backed oil company  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA. (PETR4)  It received a $950 million contract to build a
floating oil production unit for Petrobras.  Sete Brasil said in February it will spend $27 billion by
2020 on drilling units. The company ordered an $809 million
semi-submersible rig from Keppel in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
