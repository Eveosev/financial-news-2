Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  Chief
Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  said he expects investment
banking fees will rise this year as  capital markets  gain
momentum.  The firm said last week that it had $1.6 billion in fourth-
quarter investment banking fees, a 58 percent increase from a
year earlier, fueled by more debt underwriting. That was the
best quarter for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America
in “a long time,” Moynihan said today in a CNBC interview. His
company is ranked second by assets among U.S. lenders.  “The pipeline is strong, we expect to see strong fees this
year because the activity has picked up,” said Moynihan, 53.
“The financing activity has picked up, more leveraged buyout
activity, more equity offerings starting to come through, and
the mergers and acquisition activity.”  Moynihan, who started as CEO in 2010, has said he would
trim $3 billion in annual costs from investment banking and
trading operations by 2015. He said today that the firm is
mostly done with  job cuts  in Wall Street units after firings at
Asian and European desks. The CEO also said he expects the
equities division to improve as investors return to the asset.  “You’ll see a rebound, just because of the fundamental
volume dynamics going on,” Moynihan said. “Our equities
business was relatively flat over the last couple of years just
because of the volumes.”  -- Editors:  Rick Green , Dan Kraut  To contact the reporter on this story:
