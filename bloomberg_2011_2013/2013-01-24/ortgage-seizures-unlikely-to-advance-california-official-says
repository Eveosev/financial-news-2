A  California  county executive who
has led his area’s exploration of mortgage seizures to help
homeowners said he’s against moving forward with the idea.  “I don’t want to consider proposals that would utilize
eminent domain over the opposition of stakeholders,” San
Bernardino County Chief Executive Officer Greg Devereaux said
today at a  hearing  of a so-called joint powers authority created
by his county and two California cities last year. “I don’t
want to proceed in that manner.”  Advocates led by  Mortgage Resolution Partners LLC  have
called for local governments to force sales of securitized
mortgages so they can be reworked, helping homeowners with loans
larger than the value of their properties. Investors such as
Pacific Investment Management Co., which runs the world’s
largest  bond fund , and at least 18 groups representing bankers,
home builders and other financial-services firms have opposed
the idea.  Claims that the use of eminent domain would “affect our
market in a very negative way,” by raising  borrowing costs  for
new loans, suggest the step is too dangerous, Devereaux said.  “It would be wrong for me to introduce that risk to the
community without the community saying we want to take that
chance,” he said at the hearing, where the authority he chairs
will vote to  request proposals  to help homeowners. “That level
of support has not materialized.”  The use of eminent domain to help homeowners has also been
considered over the past year by local officials from elsewhere
in California to  Illinois ,  New York  and  Massachusetts .  To contact the reporters on this story:
