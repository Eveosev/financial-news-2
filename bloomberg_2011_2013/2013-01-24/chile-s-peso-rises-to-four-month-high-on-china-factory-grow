Chile ’s peso climbed to a four-month
high after a report showed manufacturing in China, the biggest
market for the South American nation’s exports, expanded at the
fastest pace in two years.  The currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 470.33 per  U.S.
dollar  at the close in Santiago, the strongest level on a
closing basis since Sept. 25. The peso extended its January gain
to 1.9 percent, the biggest among major Latin American
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Concern that Chile’s central bank or government may try to
weaken the currency has prevented it from breaking through 470
since Jan. 8. The peso reached 469.10 that day before closing
weaker as Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said its appreciation
is making exporters less competitive.  Below 470.5 there is “concern about heading into the
danger zone,” Cristian Donoso, a trader at Banchile Corredores
de Bolsa SA in Santiago, said in a phone interview. “Stronger
than that level, the market is more cautious because of a
possible reaction from the government or central bank.”  International investors cut their bets against the peso in
the forwards market to $1.6 billion on Jan. 22, the lowest level
since Sept. 12, 2011, according to data published by the central
bank today.  The preliminary reading of Markit Economics and HSBC
Holdings Plc’s  China  purchasing managers index was 51.9 in
January, compared with the 51.5 final reading for December and
the 51.7 median estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
