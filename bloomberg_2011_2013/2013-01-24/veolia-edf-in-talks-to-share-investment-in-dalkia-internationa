Veolia Environnement SA (VIE)  and
 Electricite de France SA , locked in a dispute over their energy-
services business Dalkia, are in talks on sharing investment in
the venture to better reflect their holdings.  Veolia, which currently funds all the spending of Dalkia’s
international unit, has called on equal owner EDF to contribute
to 500 million euros ($668 million) of necessary investment,
Dalkia Chairman Franck Lacroix said today in Paris. “EDF has
refused all change in this financing,” he said.  Veolia and EDF have long fought over control of Paris-based
Dalkia, whose international division is split equally by the two
utilities. EDF has so far not helped to fund the unit, focusing
its efforts instead on boosting its shareholding in French
parent Dalkia SAS, where it holds only 34 percent.  EDF sued Veolia in October, saying a 2000 agreement allowed
for 50:50 control at Dalkia SAS. Veolia dismissed the claim as
without merit.  Dalkia has contracts for heating and cooling office
buildings and hospitals. Le Figaro newspaper said in December
that Dalkia’s international unit faced a liquidity crisis
because of the spat between its two owners.  Carole Trivi, a spokeswoman for EDF in Paris, declined to
comment when telephoned today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
