BioInvent International AB (BINV) , a
Swedish biotechnology company, led gainers in the  OMX Stockholm
All-Share Index (SAX)  after announcing positive results in a study of
patients with multiple myeloma.  BioInvent  rose  as much as 52 percent in Stockholm, its
biggest intraday gain since 2001. The shares were trading 28
percent higher at 3.88 kronor as of 12:44 p.m. local time, with
trading volume more than 18 times the three-month daily average,
 valuing  the company at 286 million kronor ($44 million).  Initial results for BI-505 for treatment of the cancer
type, showed a “favorable safety profile,” the Lund, Sweden-
based company said in a statement today. BioInvent, which
focuses on antibody treatments against cancer and inflammatory
diseases, said final conclusions of the 35-patient study would
be available at a later date.  “Although this is still early stage data, the results are
encouraging,” Chief Executive Officer Cristina Glad said in the
statement. “It adds to our excitement about the potential of
this therapy to significantly improve the treatment of patients
with multiple myeloma,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
