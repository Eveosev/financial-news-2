Trinseo SA, the Bain Capital LLC-
controlled plastics maker, sold $1.33 billion of bonds in the
second-largest U.S. high-yield offering this year.  Trinseo issued 8.75 percent, six-year debt to yield 773
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The secured notes, rated B1 by
Moody’s Investors Service, are a debut issue by the Berwyn,
Pennsylvania-based company.  Proceeds will be used to fully repay the company’s term
loan B and revolving credit facility, according to a person
familiar with the transaction. The bonds are non-callable within
2.5 years, though, during that period, Trinseo can redeem 10
percent of the debt at 103 cents on the dollar each year.  Deutsche Bank AG led the offering, Bloomberg data show.
Barclays Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank
of  Nova Scotia , Bank of Montreal, Mizuho Financial Group Inc.
and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. also helped run the
sale.  Trinseo planned to sell a $450 million issue in December
2011, according to a person familiar with that transaction, but
pulled the offering from the market.  Aircraft maker  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  is the largest issuer of
dollar-denominated high-yield debt this year, selling $2 billion
of bonds on Jan. 9, Bloomberg data show.  A message left for Catherine Maxey, a Trinseo spokeswoman,
was not immediately returned. Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Mayura Hooper declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
