Coffee futures fell to a two-week
low in New York on ample supplies in  Brazil , the world’s top
producer and exporter, just as European consumers face a second
year of economic contraction.  Brazilian farmers sold 60 percent of this year’s crop by
Dec. 31 compared with 76 percent a year earlier, consulting firm
Safras & Mercado said Jan. 17. In 2012, the country’s exports to
Europe, the biggest consuming region, sank 15 percent, according
to data from  Cecafe , the nation’s exporters’ council. Yesterday,
the  International Monetary Fund  cuts its global growth forecast,
projecting a second year of contraction in the euro region.  “Brazil has been holding back a lot of coffee,” Hernando de la Roche, a senior vice president at INTL FCStone in Miami,
said in a telephone interview. “There’s concern about who’s
going to buy it” as  Europe ’s economy shrinks, he said.  Arabica coffee for March delivery tumbled 2.4 percent to
$1.4675 a pound at 12:54 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
after touching $1.461, the lowest for a most-active contract
since Jan. 9.  Stockpiles at warehouses monitored by ICE climbed to 2.612
million bags yesterday, the highest since March 2010. The
inventories surged 68 percent in 2012, the biggest annual gain
since 2000, exchange data show. A bag weighs 60 kilograms, or
132 pounds.  The ample supplies are overshadowing concern that leaf
rust, a fungus that attacks foliage, will curb output in Central
America and  Mexico , de la Roche said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
