U.S. mortgage rates climbed,
increasing borrowing costs as rising  home prices  add to
household wealth.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.42
percent in the week ended today, up from 3.38 percent and the
highest since September, McLean, Virginia-based  Freddie Mac  said
in a statement. The average 15-year rate rose to 2.71 percent
from 2.66 percent.  Home prices are increasing across the country as low
 interest rates  and improving  employment  boost demand. Higher
values support  consumer spending  by giving homeowners the
perception that they have a stronger household balance sheet and
by allowing them to refinance into lower-cost mortgages,  Joseph LaVorgna , chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.
in New York, said in a note yesterday.  “Even small moves in home prices can have large effects on
consumption, because housing comprises such a significant share
of household assets,” LaVorgna wrote.  U.S. house prices rose 5.6 percent in the 12 months through
November, according to data released yesterday by the  Federal
Housing Finance Agency .  Sales of existing homes dropped 1 percent in December,
restrained by a tight inventory of available properties, while
the  median price  jumped 12 percent from a year earlier to
$180,800, figures from the National Association of Realtors
 showed  this week. The 4.65 million homes sold last year was the
most since 2007, the group said.  A measure of  refinancing  applications increased 7.7 percent
in the week ended Jan. 18, the Washington-based  Mortgage Bankers
Association  said yesterday. The group’s  purchase  index climbed
2.5 percent.  The average 30-year mortgage rate dropped to a record 3.31
percent in November, according to  Freddie Mac. (FMCC)  The 15-year rate
fell to 2.63 percent, also the lowest on record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
