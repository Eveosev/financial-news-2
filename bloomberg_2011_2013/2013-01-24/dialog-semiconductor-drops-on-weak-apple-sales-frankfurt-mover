Dialog Semiconductor Plc (DLG) , a maker of
chips used in  Apple Inc. (AAPL) â€™s iPhone, slumped in German trading
after the company, its biggest customer, reported the weakest
sales growth in 14 quarters and forecast second-quarter revenue
that fell short of analyst estimates.  Dialog, based in Kirchheim,  Germany , fell as much as 5.5
percent, making it the largest decliner in the  HDAX Index (HDAX)  of 110
most highly capitalized stocks traded on the Frankfurt exchange.
Volume was 62 percent of the three-month daily average after 24
minutes of trading.  The German supplier depends on Cupertino, California-based
Apple for 37 percent of its revenue,  data  compiled by Bloomberg
show. Of 18 analysts that rate the stock, 10 have buy
recommendations and six advise holding Dialog shares. Two
analysts recommend that investors sell, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
