ITT Educational Services Inc. (ESI) , a
for-profit college company with a technology focus, fell to its
lowest price in almost 12 years after reporting a fourth-quarter
loss and a drop in new enrollment.  The  shares  tumbled 13 percent to $12.44 at 10:22 a.m. in
New York after declining to $11.69, the lowest intraday since
Jan. 26, 2001. The stock had lost 78 percent of its value in the
12 months through yesterday.  ITT today reported a quarterly net loss of $9.47 million,
or 41 cents a share, compared with net income of $76 million, or
$2.87, a year earlier. Sales at the Carmel, Indiana-based
company slid 18 percent to $300.8 million as new enrollment
declined 11 percent to 13,398.  For-profit colleges, once among the fastest-growing U.S.
industries, are closing campuses as scrutiny over their sales
tactics to students and competition from state university online
programs hurt enrollment and drive down  stock prices .  To contact the reporter on this story:
