French service industry output
slumped to a 46-month low and manufacturing fell, adding to
indications Europe’s second-largest economy may be in  recession .  Services output  fell to its lowest since March 2009, with
the  Purchasing Managers ’ Index falling to 43.6 from 45.2 in
December. The manufacturing PMI slipped to 42.9 from 44.6, a
four-month low. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction.  The declines underline how President  Francois Hollande  is
struggling to revive growth in the wake of Europe’s sovereign
debt crisis. Jobless claims are at their highest in 15 years and
will probably increase again when the labor ministry publishes
December figures later today, according to five economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “French flash PMIs are falling heavily,” said  Dominique
Barbet , an economist at BNP Paribas in Paris. “General activity
remains very weak and confirms our forecast of two consecutive
quarters of contraction.”  The French economy is expected to contract 0.1 percent in
the current quarter after shrinking an estimated 0.3 percent
last quarter, according to the median of nine forecasts in a
Bloomberg survey published on Jan. 17. That suggests  France  has
slipped into a recession for the first time since 2009.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its 2013 growth
forecast for France yesterday to 0.3 percent from 0.4 percent.
“This is still above our estimate, which is zero growth for a
second year running,” Barbet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
