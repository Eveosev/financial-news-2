Polyus Gold International Ltd. (PGIL) 
headed for the biggest surge on record as billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov ’s Onexim Holdings Ltd. agreed to sell his entire stake
in the company to a group of investors, according to three
people with knowledge of the plan.  The gold producer jumped as much as 8.5 percent before
trading up 6.2 percent at 211.50 pence by 12:56 p.m. in  London ,
poised for the strongest rally since the stock’s listing in
June. The amount of shares traded was 4.7 million, equivalent to
about 3.5 times the three-month average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Onexim and the investors have requested approval from the
U.K. takeover panel for the deal’s structure, said the people
who asked not to be identified as the information is
confidential. They didn’t name the buyers for Prokhorov’s 37.8
percent of the London-traded gold producer.  Prokhorov, the world’s 68th richest person in the  Bloomberg
Billionaires Index  with a fortune of $13.6 billion, is selling
industrial assets, while holding onto investments in financial
ventures. OAO Gazprom’s unit is buying his Quadra power utility,
Vedomosti said this month.  The shares of Polyus’s Moscow-traded unit surged as much as
9.6 percent, trading up 7.5 percent at 1,177.30 rubles.  To contact the reporters on this story:
