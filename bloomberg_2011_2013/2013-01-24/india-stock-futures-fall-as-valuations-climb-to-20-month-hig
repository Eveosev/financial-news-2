Indian (SENSEX)  stocks fell after valuations
on the benchmark index increased to a 20-month high. Carmakers,
metal and real estate shares led the retreat.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost 0.5 percent
to 19,932.03, according to preliminary closing prices. The BSE
Mid-Cap Index tumbled 2.6 percent as 34 stocks sank more than 5
percent each. The BSE India Realty Index lost 4.3 percent.  Tata
Motors Ltd. (TTMT)  fell the most since May after its Jaguar Land Rover
Plc unit said profit growth stalled. Copper producer  Sterlite
Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT)  and aluminum maker  Hindalco Industries
Ltd. (HNDL)  plunged 3 percent each.  The Sensex advanced 3 percent this year through yesterday,
pushing up valuations to 16.8 times reported earnings, the most
expensive since May 2011. The International Monetary Fund pared
its 2013 estimate for India to 5.9 percent from 6 percent, the
Washington-based lender said in a report yesterday.  “The growth momentum has to pick up before new investors
come in as the existing story is probably reasonably valued,”
Anand Tandon, chief executive officer of JRG Securities Ltd.,
told Bloomberg TV India today.  Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram is on a tour of
Asia and Europe to woo investors. He pledged to deepen a policy
overhaul that lured foreigners to invest $24.5 billion into
domestic shares last year, the most among the 10 Asian markets
tracked by Bloomberg, excluding China. The inflows helped fuel
the  biggest annual increase  in the Sensex since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
