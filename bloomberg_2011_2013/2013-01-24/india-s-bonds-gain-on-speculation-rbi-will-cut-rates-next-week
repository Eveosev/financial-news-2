India ’s bonds advanced on optimism
the central bank will cut interest rates next week to revive
economic growth, which the government forecasts will slow to the
least in a decade this financial year.  Fifteen of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predict policy
makers will lower the repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 7.75
percent on Jan. 29, while two see a 50 basis point reduction and
one no change. Inflation of 7 percent is “unacceptable,”
Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said in  Singapore 
yesterday. Gross domestic product will increase by as little as
5.7 percent in the 12 months through March, the government said
in a mid-year review to Parliament on Dec. 17. That would be the
slowest pace since 2003.  “The monetary authority may cut rates by 25 basis
points,” said Harihar Krishnamoorthy, Mumbai-based treasurer at
the Indian unit of  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) , South Africa’s second-largest
financial services provider. “But with inflation still at
elevated levels, the central bank may temper expectations for
further rate cuts.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds maturing in June 2022
fell one basis points, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.86 percent
as of 9:26 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. The rate has dropped 19 basis points this year.  The repo rate was last lowered by half a percentage point
in April. The wholesale-price  index , the benchmark inflation
measure, rose 7.18 percent in December from a year earlier, the
smallest increase since 2009, government data showed last week.  The Reserve Bank of India considers an inflation rate of
between 4 percent and 5 percent as a comfortable level, Deputy
Governor K.C. Chakrabarty said on Nov. 15.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was little
changed at 7.56 percent in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
