Angel Gurria , secretary general of
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said
policy makers in the euro area should push ahead with deficit
cuts and avoid the “false dilemma” of the austerity debate.  “You need fiscal consolidation in many countries and at
the same time you need to plant the seeds of future growth,”
Gurria said today in an interview at the  World Economic Forum  in
Davos,  Switzerland . “Let’s go for the reforms, accelerate the
reforms, so we can consolidate the recovery.”  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its growth forecast for
the 17-nation euro area yesterday, predicting a second year of
contraction as the region’s governments seek to reduce public
borrowing and revamp their economies in the wake of a sovereign
debt crisis. Gurria said that increasing flexibility of both
labor and product markets is key to reviving growth.  “If you really want to go for a durable recovery, you
really have to go for the fundamental measures,” Gurria said.
“Some of these take a long time to get results but today,
paradoxically, your best short-term policies may be your best
long-term reforms. The announcement and communication of where
you want to go may be your best bet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
