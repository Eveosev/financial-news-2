South  Korea ’s won fell to the lowest
level this month as the nation’s economic growth missed
economists’ estimates and on concern that global expansion
remains weak. Government bonds were steady.  Gross domestic product  increased 1.5 percent from a year
earlier, unchanged from the expansion in the third quarter, the
central bank said today. That’s less than the 1.8 percent median
forecast of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The
International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecasts and
projected a second year of contraction in the euro region, while
 Japan ’s exports fell for a seventh month in December and its
annual trade deficit swelled to a record.  “Concerns that economic recovery is still weak in Korea
and globally are driving stocks and the won lower,” said Jeon
Seung Ji, analyst at Samsung Futures Inc. in  Seoul . “While
investors are cautious after the finance minister warned of the
won’s gains, exporters may look for opportunities to sell
dollars and that may limit further declines.”  The won fell 0.3 percent to 1,069.28 per dollar as of 10:16
a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 1.070.53 on Dec. 28. One-month implied volatility in the
won, a gauge of expected moves in exchange rates used to price
options, rose 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 6.02
percent, the data show.  Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan vowed to curb volatility,
saying recent gains were too steep. The government is “all
ready” for new measures, Bahk told reporters in Seoul
yesterday, declining to comment on when they will be announced.
The currency touched 1,054.49 on Jan. 15, a level not seen since
August 2011, after rallying 8.3 percent last year in Asia’s best
performance.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due September
2017 was unchanged at 2.83 percent, Korea Exchange prices show.
The Kospi index of shares dropped 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
