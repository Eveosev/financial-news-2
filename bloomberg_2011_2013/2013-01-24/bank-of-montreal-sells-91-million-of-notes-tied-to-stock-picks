Bank of Montreal  sold $91 million
more notes tied to a basket of 11 stocks chosen as this year’s
“best picks” by  Raymond James Financial Inc. (RJF)   The one-year securities, issued Jan. 15, yield the gains of
the stocks or American depository shares of companies selected
by the equity research team at Raymond James, according to a
 prospectus  filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. Raymond James distributed the notes to its network
of more than 6,200 advisers for a 2.75 percent fee.  The bank issued $100 million of similar securities on Dec.
11, its largest offering in the U.S. last year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The total for the two sales is 16
percent more than the $165.3 million of securities that it
issued tied to the 2012 Raymond James stock picks.  The companies that make up this year’s basket include  Bed
Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY) ,  Jabil Circuit Inc. (JBL)  and  Tractor Supply Co. (TSCO)   Martha McInnis, a spokeswoman for the bank, declined to
comment on the offering.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
