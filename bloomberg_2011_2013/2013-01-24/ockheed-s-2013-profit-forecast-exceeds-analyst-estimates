  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the world’s
largest defense contractor, forecast a 2013 profit exceeding
analysts’ estimates after fourth-quarter earnings declined.  Lockheed said profit for the year will be $8.80 to $9.10 a
share on sales of $44.5 billion to $46 billion. The average
estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was a profit of
$8.28 a share on sales of $45.3 billion.  Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter
was $569 million, or $1.73 a share, compared with $698 million
or $2.14 a share, a year earlier, the Bethesda, Maryland-based
company said in a statement today. The average estimate of 21
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit of $1.82 a
share.  Marillyn Hewson, who became Lockheed’s chief executive
officer this month, faces the challenge of protecting the
company’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter from budget cuts as Pentagon
spending comes under pressure from efforts by Congress and the
Obama administration to reduce U.S. deficits.  The F-35 is the Pentagon’s costliest weapons program, and
the company reached an agreement with the Pentagon last month on
contracts that would ensure continued production of the fighter
jet if automatic budget cuts take effect in March.  Still, the company must contend with continued uncertainty
from the threatened cuts, Hewson said in the statement. U.S.
defense companies confront the prospect of across-the-board cuts
in defense spending of $45 billion by Sept. 30 if Congress and
President  Barack Obama  can’t reach agreement on alternative
spending reductions.  Lockheed fell 2.7 percent to $93.52 at 10:03 a.m. in  New
York  trading after gaining 16 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
