Wheat fell to a one-week low on
speculation that  U.S. exports will trail government forecasts
for the year through May 31.  U.S. wheat  shipment s from June 1 through Jan. 10 totaled
13.9 million metric tons, down 13 percent from the same period a
year earlier, Department of Agriculture data show. The USDA has
forecast shipments at 28.6 million tons.  “We’re barely on track to meet the USDA projections, and I
don’t think we’re going to make it,” Dewey Strickler, the
president of Ag Watch Market Advisers in Franklin,  Kentucky ,
said by telephone. “The wheat market is tired. It needs some
fresh news and we don’t have any.”  Wheat futures for March delivery dropped 1.1 percent to
$7.665 a bushel at 10:55 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade
after touching $7.63 a bushel, the lowest since Jan. 14.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
