Renewable Energy Generation Ltd. (WIND) 
rose to the highest in almost three years in London trading
after agreeing on a 32.1 million-pound ($50.8 million) wind-farm
sale to  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  as part of a longer-term partnership.  REG jumped 18 percent to 62 pence as of 11:44 a.m. local
time, the highest price since Feb. 24, 2010, after selling its
10-megawatt Sancton Hill and 6-megawatt South Sharpley wind
projects to BlackRock. More than 188,500 shares have traded so
far, more than double the three-month daily average.  REG will receive 16.2 million pounds in cash as well as a
deferred payment of 650,000 pounds, and assume 15.3 million
pounds in project debt, it said today in a statement. The accord
allows BlackRock to buy future REG wind plants, including a 4-
megawatt park this spring. REG, which will also get payments for
managing the projects, said the tie-up allows it to fund growth.  REG, based in St Helier,  Jersey , will use some of the
proceeds from todayâ€™s sale to build 21 megawatts of wind power
in Cornwall, southwest  England , according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
