The market for corporate borrowing
through  commercial paper  contracted for the first time in three
months, led by a drop in issuance from financial institutions.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
fell $7.3 billion to $1.126 trillion outstanding in the week
ended yesterday after 12 straight weeks of expansion, the
Federal Reserve said today on its website. That was the first
decrease since the period ended Oct. 24 for the market, which
declined after reaching the highest level since August 2011 in
the prior week.  Commercial paper issued by U.S.-based banks  fell for the
first time in five weeks, decreasing $8.2 billion to $331.7
billion outstanding, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Corporations sell commercial paper, typically maturing in 270
days or less, to fund everyday activities such as rent and
salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
