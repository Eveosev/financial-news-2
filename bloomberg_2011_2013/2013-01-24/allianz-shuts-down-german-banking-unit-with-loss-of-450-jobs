Allianz SE (ALV) , Europe’s biggest
insurer, will close down its German unit Allianz Bank by the end
of June, laying off 450 people across the country.  “Our expectations to grow with our business model in the
highly competitive retail market were not fulfilled,” Andree Moschner, board member of Allianz Deutschland AG, said in an e-
mailed statement today. “We do not see a sustainable turn for
the better because of the persistent difficult market
environment.”  Oldenburger Landesbank, which runs Allianz Bank, will
remain open, Moschner said.  “The OLB will continue its successful business in the
northwest of  Germany  as the biggest private regional bank,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
