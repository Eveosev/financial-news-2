Top-ranked  Duke University  fell
90-63 to the University of Miami, the worst regular-season
defeat in men’s college basketball for the Blue Devils in 29
years.  The No. 25 Hurricanes, ranked for the first time since
2010, took control with a 25-1 scoring run in the first half at
BankUnited Center in Coral Gables,  Florida , as Duke failed to
score a field goal for more than eight minutes. The Hurricanes
led 42-19 at halftime.  “Some teams come out in the second half flat and think
they have the game won,” Shane Larkin, who had 18 points, 10
rebounds and five assists for Miami, told reporters. “But we
stayed with it with the same energy in the second half. We
played great the whole game.”  It was Duke’s most lopsided regular-season defeat since a
97-66 rout by Wake Forest on Jan. 18, 1984. At 27 points, the
margin is the widest for the Blue Devils since a 30-point defeat
against the University of Nevada-Las Vegas in the 1990 national
title game.  “What you had was a terrific win for them, but not a
terrific game,” Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski told reporters. “We
didn’t hold our end of the bargain.”  Miami is 14-3 overall and leads the Atlantic Coast
Conference with a 5-0 mark after its second straight win against
Duke and its first success against a No. 1 team.  Duke fell to 16-2 overall and 3-2 in the ACC, leaving it in
third place in the conference standings.  Durand Scott and Kenny Kadji had season-high point tallies
of 25 and 22, respectively, for Miami.  Rasheed Sulaimon had 16 points and Mason Plumlee had 15
points and 11 rebounds for Duke. Seth Curry went scoreless,
missing all 10 of his shots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
