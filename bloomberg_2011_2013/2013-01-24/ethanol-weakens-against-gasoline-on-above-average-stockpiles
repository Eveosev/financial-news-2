Ethanol weakened against gasoline
for a third day after a government report showed higher-than-
normal stockpiles of the fuel.  The spread widened 2.11 cents after the Energy Information
Administration said  stockpiles  in the week ended Jan. 18 totaled
20 million barrels, 1.4 percent higher than a year earlier and
the highest for this time of year since the Energy Department’s
statistical arm began tracking weekly data in June 2010.
Gasoline advanced as inventories declined for the first time in
nine weeks.  “There’s plenty of supply,” said  Terry Reilly , a senior
commodity analyst at Chicago-based Futures International. “Even
though the stock number was down in the report, stocks are
ample.”  The grain-based additive was 48.09 cents cheaper than
gasoline, based on prompt-month contracts for both commodities,
the widest since Jan. 10. The spread was 45.98 cents yesterday.  Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 0.8 cent, or
0.3 percent, to $2.382 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have advanced 9.5 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for February delivery climbed 2.91 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.8629 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  Cash Ethanol  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.43 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive
decreased 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.57, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in  Chicago  rose 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.385 a
gallon and in  New York  the biofuel slipped 0.5 cent to $2.48.  Corn for March delivery advanced 3.5 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $7.2425 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 24 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, up from 23
cents yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
figures exclude the revenue that can be made from the sale of
dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that
can be fed to livestock.  Ethanol  production  rose 1 percent to an average of 792,000
barrels a day, rebounding from the lowest level since the EIA
started tracking the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
