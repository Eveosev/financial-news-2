Senator  John Kerry , the
Massachusetts Democrat and nominee to be the next secretary of
state, defended Chuck Hagel, the former Republican senator from
Nebraska who is now President  Barack Obama ’s nominee to lead the
Defense Department.  “I know Chuck Hagel, he’s a strong patriotic senator and
he will be a strong Secretary of Defense,” Kerry said. “I
think some of the efforts to color Senator Hagel’s approach to
some of these things do him an injustice,” Kerry said.  Hagel has been criticized by fellow Republicans, including
Senator  John McCain  of Arizona, for being insufficiently
supportive of Israel. Kerry was answering a question at his
nomination hearing from Tennessee Republican Senator Robert
Corker, who asked about Hagel’s commitment to maintaining U.S.
nuclear deterrent capacity.  “I don’t think Senator Hagel would go over to the Defense
Department and be an opponent,” Kerry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
