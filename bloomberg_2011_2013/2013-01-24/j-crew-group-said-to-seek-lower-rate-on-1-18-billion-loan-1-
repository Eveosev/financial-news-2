J. Crew Group Inc., the clothing
retailer that TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners LP took
private, is seeking to lower the rate it pays on a $1.18 billion
term loan B, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction.  The  interest rate  on the debt, due in 2018, will be reduced
to 3 percentage points more than the London interbank offered
rate and will be sold at par, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because the information is private. Libor, a rate
banks say they can borrow in dollars from each other, will have
a 1 percent floor.  Lenders are being offered six months of soft-call
protection of 101 cents, meaning the company would have to pay 1
cent more than face value to refinance the debt during the first
six months.  Bank of America Corp. is arranging the transaction and
commitments are due Jan. 29 by 5 p.m. in  New York , according to
the person.  The companyâ€™s existing term loan pays interest at 3.25
percentage points more than Libor with a 1.25 percent floor, the
person said. The debt was quoted at 101.5 cents on the dollar
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Owen Blicksilver , a spokesman for TPG, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
