China Minsheng Banking Corp. (1988) , the
nation’s first privately owned lender, headed for a record close
in Hong Kong trading after its profit forecast prompted ICBC
International Research Ltd. to increase its price estimate.  Minsheng advanced 1.1 percent to HK$11.02 as of 1:05 p.m.,
set for the highest closing price since it began trading in the
city on Nov. 26, 2009. The stock has climbed 54 percent in the
past year, compared with a 17 percent gain in the city’s
benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  ICBC International increased its price estimate for the
Beijing-based lender by 20 percent to HK$12.40 after Minsheng
 said  its 2012  net income  may rise 35 percent to 37.6 billion
 yuan  ($6 billion). Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd. earlier
this week upgraded Minsheng to buy, saying China’s economic
recovery means an increase in bad loans may be milder than
earlier estimated.  “The upbeat results could trigger consensus earnings
upgrade,” Ivan Lin, an analyst at ICBC International, wrote
today. “Concerns on capital adequacy, deposits and asset
qualities” appear to be “overdone.”  China’s banking system is grappling with rising defaults
and weaker loan demand. Bank of Communications Co., the
country’s fifth-largest lender, warned in December that Chinese
banks’ profit growth may slow to a range of 7 percent to 8
percent this year from an estimated 17 percent in 2012 as
borrowers turn to bond financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
