Vienna Insurance Group AG (VIG) , the
biggest insurer in eastern  Europe , said it had a less-than-
estimated pretax profit increase last year as growth outside
 Poland  stalled.  Earnings rose 5 percent to about 585 million euros ($780
million) in 2012, according to preliminary results, the Vienna-
based company said in a statement today. That implies fourth-
quarter profit fell 2 percent to about 142 million euros,
according to Bloomberg News calculations. The  average estimate 
of 13 analysts was for pretax profit of 588.5 million euros,
while 11 predicted earnings of more than 585 million euros.  “The strong demand for insurance products in the central
and eastern European region has led to a substantial expansion
of Vienna Insurance Group’s business also in 2012,” Chief
Executive Officer Peter Hagen said in the statement.  Vienna Insurance fell 1 percent to 38.65 euros at 9:02 a.m.
in Vienna trading, making it the worst performer in the 14-
member EURO STOXX Insurance index.  Vienna Insurance, which makes more than half of its revenue
in the former communist part of Europe, is relying on growth
from that region because people are still spending a smaller
share of their income on insurance than in western Europe. While
it benefits from increasing savings in Poland and the Czech and
Slovak republics, products like car insurance have suffered from
the slowdown in countries including  Romania .  Unconsolidated premiums written rose 9.5 percent to 9.87
billion euros last year, driven by life-insurance premiums that
more than tripled in Poland, and by growth with corporate
customers in  Austria , Vienna Insurance said in  slides  prepared
for presentation to investors today. Premiums slid in Romania
and the  Czech Republic , it said.  The company said it would continue to pay out about 30
percent of net income as a dividend. It didn’t say what net
income was last year. Final results are due April 3.  Vienna Insurance paid 1.10 euros a share for 2011 and the
 Bloomberg dividend estimate  is 1.20 euros for 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
