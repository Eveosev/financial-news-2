(Corrects year of Japanese LNG consumption in third
paragraph.)  Singapore will consume as much as 3
million metric tons of liquefied natural gas by 2015, Steve
Hill,  BG Group Plc (BG/) â€™s vice president of global LNG and oil
marketing, said at a conference in the Asian city-state.  The nation is constructing an LNG import terminal with a
capacity of 9 million tons a year.  Japan may bring in 100 million tons a year of LNG by 2025,
said Hill. The country imported a record 87.3 million last year,
the finance ministry said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
