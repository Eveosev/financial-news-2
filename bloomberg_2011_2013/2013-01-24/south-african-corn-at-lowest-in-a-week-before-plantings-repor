South African corn futures declined
today in anticipation of a Crop Estimates Committee report that
may show the area for corn plantings has increased, an analyst
said.  “Everyone is waiting for this afternoon’s announcement
from the CEC, Theo Venter, an analyst at Klerksdorp, South
Africa-based Senwes Ltd., said by phone. ‘‘They anticipate
bigger maize plantings.’’  White corn for March delivery, the most active contract,
dropped 1 percent to 2,180 rand ($241) a metric ton, the lowest
since Jan. 17, by the midday close in Johannesburg. The yellow
variety for delivery in July, declined 0.8 percent to 2,099 rand
a ton.  A median estimate of six traders surveyed by Bloomberg News
on Jan. 18 showed that corn plantings may remain unchanged from
the previous forecast of 2.74 million hectares (6.77 million
acres). The committee releases its predictions at 3:30 p.m.  ‘‘In the Free State some areas for wheat planting were not
used, so they think that will now be available for maize
plantings,’’ Venter said.  Meal made from white corn, which is also called maize, is
one of South Africa’s staple foods, while the yellow variety is
mainly used as animal feed.  Wheat for delivery in March rose 0.9 percent to 3,670 rand
a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
