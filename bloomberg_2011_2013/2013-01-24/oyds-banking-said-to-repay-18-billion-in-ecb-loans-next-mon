Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , Britain’s
second-biggest taxpayer-assisted lender, next month plans to
repay most of the 11.4 billion pounds ($18 billion) of three-
year loans borrowed from the  European Central Bank  last year,
according to a person with knowledge of the plan.  The bank will repay about 8 billion pounds of the money at
the first opportunity on Feb. 27, said the person who declined
to be identified because the matter is private.  Lloyds was one of 800 banks that took an unprecedented
529.5 billion euros ($706.8 billion) from the Frankfurt-based
central bank when it held its second Longer Term Refinancing
Operation in March. About 523 institutions borrowed 489 billion
euros in the previous operation in December. Lloyds didn’t take
any funds from the ECB’s first auction.  The ECB, based in  Frankfurt , has been providing the banking
system with cheap money over three years in an effort to avert a
credit crunch after the market for unsecured bank debt seized
up. Any bank in the region can borrow an unlimited amount,
provided it pledges eligible collateral.  The move was first reported by Reuters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
