European  gasoline  advanced for a
sixth day as Cargill Inc. and  BP Plc (BP/)  bought on the barge market.
Gasoil declined on the ICE Futures Europe exchange as Brent
crude fell.  Gunvor Group Ltd. plans to build refineries, Chief
Executive Officer Torbjorn Tornqvist said today in an interview
in Davos,  Switzerland , declining to elaborate.  Light Products  Gasoline in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil hub gained
to as much as $1,017 a metric ton, the highest since Oct. 17,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. Barges changed hands from
$1,006 to $1,015 a ton yesterday.  Vitol Group,  Total SA (FP)  and Trafigura Beheer BV sold the
Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added before being sold at
the pump. Argos Groep BV also bought on the barge market, where
lots of 1,000 and 2,000 tons are usually traded.  Gasoline’s  crack , or premium to  Brent crude , fell 46 cents
to $8.78 a barrel as of 10:45 a.m. London time, according to PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a crude and refined products broker. It
rose to the highest level since Oct. 11 yesterday.  Naphtha’s crack , or discount to Brent crude, widened to
$6.43 barrel, according to PVM data. It was at $5.99 yesterday.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for February delivery fell $2.25 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $968.50 a ton on the ICE exchange as of 11:48 a.m.
London time. The contract traded at a premium of $7.75 to March
futures, compared with $8 yesterday. The market has been in
backwardation since Jan. 11, a structure that can signal rising
near-term consumption or reduced supply.  Gasoil’s  crack  was little changed at $16.49 a barrel. Brent
declined 0.3 percent to $112.45 a barrel.  Refining  Gunvor, which bought refineries in Antwerp, Belgium and
Ingolstadt,  Germany  last year, can extract better value from
crude processing that major  oil companies , he said.  “We are actually planning to construct a couple of
refineries around the world and we are looking for investment
opportunities outside  Russia  as well,” Tornqvist said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
