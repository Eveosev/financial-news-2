China  may publish details in May of
a plan allowing individuals to invest in overseas  capital
markets , the Shanghai Securities News  reported  today, citing a
person it didn’t identify.  Policy makers will meet after the Lunar New Year holiday
next month to discuss definitions of investors and trustee
arrangements under the qualified domestic individual investor
program, the newspaper reported. Securities companies in Hong
Kong have submitted proposals to Chinese regulators, according
to the report.  China’s foreign-exchange regulator said in April it would
gradually open more channels for capital outflows and relax
limits on residents’ overseas investments, as it seeks to make
the  yuan  a fully convertible currency. The nation has sought to
reduce its reliance on the dollar after accumulating $3.31
trillion of foreign-exchange reserves, the world’s largest.  One suggestion from an association of Chinese securities
companies in  Hong Kong  calls for investment quotas to be
allocated to Chinese brokerages’ overseas subsidiaries, which in
turn could parcel out the allotments to clients, according to
the newspaper.  The People’s Bank of China lists the so-called QDII2
initiative as one of its major goals for 2013. The bank is
preparing for the trial program, it said Jan. 11, without giving
further details.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
