China’s stocks  fell, with the
Shanghai Composite Index erasing a 1.8 percent rally, as  North
Korea ’s threat to test nuclear weapons overshadowed a report
showing the nation’s manufacturing is accelerating.  Gauges (SHSZ300)  tracking commodities producers sank more than 2
percent. China Shenhua Energy Co., the nation’s largest cpal
producer, retreated to its lowest level in a month, while
Jiangxi Copper Co., the largest producer, slumped 2.2 percent.
Liquor maker Kweichow Moutai Co. lost 1.5 percent after the
Oriental Morning Post said product prices have dropped.  “There’s some psychological effect on investors after
hearing about North Korea’s threat,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-
based  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285
million. “Stocks have rallied considerably recently and
naturally face some correction risk.”  The benchmark stock  index  lost 0.8 percent to 2,302.60 at
the close, after earlier taking its gain from a three-year low
on Dec. 3 to 20 percent. The gauge is valued at 12.7 times
reported earnings, near the highest level since May,  data 
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The CSI 300 Index slipped 1 percent to 2,582.75. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in  Hong
Kong  dropped 0.6 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the
measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, fell
0.5 percent in  New York  yesterday.  Trading volumes in the Shanghai Composite were 32 percent
higher than the 30-day average today. Its 30-day  volatility  was
at 20.4, near the 11-month high of 21.6 on Jan. 17.  North Korea threatened to conduct a nuclear weapons test
“targeted” at the U.S. after the nation pushed through United
Nations sanctions against the totalitarian state for a rocket
launch last month.  PMI Data  Shenhua lost 1.4 percent to 23.79  yuan . Jiangxi Copper
dropped 2.2 percent to 23.78 yuan in a fourth day of declines.  The preliminary reading of a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was
51.9 in January, according to a statement from HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics today. That compares with the 51.5 final
reading for December and the 51.7 median estimate of 17 analysts
surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  The data suggest that economic growth at the start of 2013
will equal or exceed its 7.9 percent clip in the fourth quarter,
reducing the likelihood that the nation’s new leadership headed
by Xi Jinping will roll out additional measures to support
expansion.  China’s economic risks have shifted back to growing too
quickly as new regional-government officials try to boost
development, a former central bank adviser said.  Moutai Declines  “The new problem is how to prevent overheating,” which
would stoke inflation and asset bubbles while pushing the
government to enact controls,  Fan Gang , a People’s Bank of China
academic adviser from 2006 to 2010, said yesterday in an
interview in Davos, Switzerland, where he is attending the  World
Economic Forum .  A measure of consumer-staples stocks in the CSI 300 slid
1.4 percent.  Kweichow Moutai, China’s biggest producer of baijiu liquor
by market value, slipped 1.5 percent to 195.96 yuan, the lowest
close since Dec. 6. The price of Moutai’s “feitian” 53 percent
alcoholic product dropped about 20 percent to between 1,100 yuan
and 1,200 yuan, the Oriental Morning Post reported, citing an
unidentified retailer.  Wuliangye Yibin Co., the second largest, fell 1.5 percent
to 25.90 yuan, capping a ninth day of losses. Sichuan Swellfun
Co., the Chinese liquor maker that’s a partner of Diageo Plc,
lost 3.1 percent to 17.77 yuan.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its global growth
predictions yesterday while maintaining its forecast for China,
seen growing 8.2 percent this year and 8.5 percent in 2014. The
world economy will expand 3.5 percent this year, less than the
3.6 percent forecast in October, the Washington-based IMF said
in an update of its World Economic Outlook report.  The iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund, the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., dropped 0.5 percent to $41.53
yesterday, after rising the previous three days.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
