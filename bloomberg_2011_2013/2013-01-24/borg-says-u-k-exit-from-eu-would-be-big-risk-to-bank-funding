Swedish Finance Minister  Anders Borg 
said it would be a “big risk” for his country if the U.K. left
the European Union because the Nordic nation’s banks and biggest
companies rely on  London  for their funding.  “Swedish banks are refinancing in London and you can’t
have one legal system for banking and one for industry,” Borg
said today in an interview in the Swiss city of Davos with
Bloomberg Television’s Francine Lacqua. “Our multinationals do
most of their banking through London and for them to be
competitive in the world market, and safe, it’s very difficult
to have their banking business outside the EU and their main
customers inside.”  U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron yesterday pledged a
referendum by the end of 2017 on whether to leave the EU. Borg
said last week that a U.K. exit from the union would threaten
London’s status as a financial hub.  Borg, who is pushing through stricter  capital requirements 
for  Sweden ’s  biggest banks  than those set elsewhere, said in
November that the government may limit bank borrowing in foreign
currencies by introducing a levy. About 90 percent of short-term
funding for Sweden’s biggest banks is in foreign currencies,
Mattias Persson, head of the financial stability department at
the Riksbank, said on Nov. 27.  Borg said today his push for stricter capital requirements
at home has boosted investor trust in Sweden’s banks.  “That gives us a sign we need to continue in this
direction,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
