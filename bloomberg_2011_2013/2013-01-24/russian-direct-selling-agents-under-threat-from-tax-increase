Up to a third of Russian direct-
selling agents may quit their jobs because of a new law raising
taxes on self-employed entrepreneurs, according to the head of
the association that represents them.  The increase in the tax to 35,665 rubles ($1,187) a year
from 17,208 rubles will be “unbearable” for many of the door-
to-door sellers that represent companies such as  Avon Products
Inc. (AVP) , Tamara Shokareva, head of Russian direct-selling
association, said at a conference in Moscow today.  The tax will be more than 50 percent of the sales of many
of the students, pensioners and people searching for extra-
incomes from direct-selling jobs, Shokareva said. About 4
million people are representatives of direct-selling companies
in Russia, though not all of those are active, Shokareva said.  Avon, the world’s largest door-to-door cosmetics seller,
may suffer as a result of the tax increase, Angela Cretu,
general manager of Avon Russia, said in an interview.  Russia is a promising market for the New York-based
company, generating about $1 billion sales in 2011, Cretu said.  “People here are much more inclined to have social
gatherings that enable a channel like ours to gain traction,”
she said. “Also, retail in  Russia  hasn’t yet expanded into the
rural areas where direct-selling has a strong coverage.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
