Japan , the biggest buyer of wheat
from the U.S., increased domestic production by 15 percent last
year as ample rainfall boosted yields, the  United Nations ’ Food
& Agriculture Organization said.  Japan produced 855,000 metric tons of  wheat  in 2012, up
from 746,000 tons in 2011, the Rome-based UN agency wrote in a
country  report  on its website dated yesterday. Grain imports in
the 2012-13 marketing year may be at a “normal level” of about
25.17 million tons. The country usually imports about 15 million
tons of corn annually because it doesn’t grow the crop
domestically, according to the report.  “Production of wheat covers only a small portion of the
domestic consumption requirements, therefore the country imports
large amounts of wheat,” the FAO said.  Japan’s  rice  harvest was pegged at 10.54 million tons,
little changed from a year earlier, the FAO said. Barley
production was estimated at 172,000 tons, also steady with 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
