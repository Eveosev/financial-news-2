Pollution levels in Beijing improved
to levels deemed safe by the  World Health Organization  as a cold
front dispersed smog that had enveloped the capital city
yesterday.  The concentration of PM2.5, the fine air particulates that
pose the greatest health risk, was nine micrograms per cubic
meter at 7 a.m. along a road near  Tiananmen Square , compared
with an average of 221 in the preceding 24 hours, a city
 government website  said. The WHO recommends 24-hour exposure to
PM2.5 of no higher than 25.  Beijing was hit by record air pollution earlier this month,
spurring city leaders to propose rules that would scrap old
vehicles, ban new cement and steel factories and impose fines
for street vendors barbecuing food by roadsides on smoggy days.
The cold front today and tomorrow will bring  lower temperatures 
in central and eastern China and disperse fog in northern
regions, the China Meteorological Administration said in an e-
mailed report today.  The skyline of Beijingâ€™s eastern Chaoyang district,
obscured by smog yesterday, was clearly visible today from more
than seven kilometers (four miles) to the west.  Long-term exposure to fine particulates raises the risk of
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases as well as  lung cancer ,
according to the WHO.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
