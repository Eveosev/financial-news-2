Short-term use of  folic acid , a B
vitamin added to food in many countries to prevent  birth
defects , is unlikely to significantly increase cancer risk,
according to a review of results from 13 studies.  Among people who took folic acid supplements daily for five
years or less, 7.7 percent reported new cases of cancer,
compared with 7.3 percent among those who took a placebo,
according to an analysis of studies involving almost 50,000
individuals through the end of 2010. The review was published
today in the Lancet medical journal.  The analysis, conducted by researchers participating in the
B-Vitamin Treatment Trialists’ Collaboration affiliated with
Oxford University, contradicts findings from previous research
that suggested an increased risk of developing cancer from
taking folic acid. Even among those with the highest average
intake, there was no significant increase in overall incidence,
the researchers said in a statement about the paper.  “Both the hopes for rapid cancer prevention and the fears
about rapidly increased cancer risk from folic acid
supplementation were not confirmed by this meta-analysis,” the
authors said in the published paper.  The supplement dose of folic acid used in the studies
covered by the analysis was about 10 times higher than the dose
of fortification used in the U.S., Joshua Miller of Rutgers
University’s Department of Nutritional Science in  New Jersey  and
Cornelia Ulrich of the German Cancer Research Center in
Heidelberg,  Germany , noted in a comment accompanying the paper.  “Additional epidemiological and statistical analyses are
warranted to address population-based hypotheses that are
consistent with our current understanding of the biochemistry
and biology of folate and cancer,” they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
