Romania  is set to pay its  lowest 
yield in an auction of 10-year bonds today as the proposed
inclusion of the nation’s debt in two emerging market indexes
buoys investor demand.  The  Finance Ministry  will offer 600 million lei ($183
million) of April 2023 bonds, according to a issuance calendar
published on Bloomberg. The average yield at the sale may drop
to between 5.6 percent and 5.7 percent, the lowest since the
central bank started recording the data in 2005, according to
analyst estimates from Erste Group Bank AG, Societe Generale SA
and Piraeus Bank Romania SA. That compares with a rate of 6.75
percent on similar maturity debt auctioned on March 1.  Romania has raised 10.3 billion lei of domestic debt this
month before today’s issuance, the most since 2005, and 502.5
million euros ($670 million) of three-year euro-denominated
local bonds on Jan. 22, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The entry of Romania’s local-currency debt to  Barclays Plc (BARC) 
and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s indexes from March 1 has helped lower
Romania’s borrowing costs and strengthen its currency by 1.6
percent this month.  Yields on July 2017 bonds, eligible for inclusion in the
JPMorgan’s GBI-EM Index Series, slumped to a record 5.4 percent
on Jan. 17, compared with a rate of 6.57 percent on similar-
maturity notes sold on Dec. 13.  The rate on Romania’s six-month bills -- not eligible for
JPMorgan debt gauge -- fell to a 10-month low of 5.53 percent at
a sale on Jan. 21. The Finance Ministry sold 300 million lei of
treasuries, in line with its target.  The leu weakened 0.2 percent to 4.3725 per euro by 1:42
p.m. in Bucharest, falling for a fifth day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
