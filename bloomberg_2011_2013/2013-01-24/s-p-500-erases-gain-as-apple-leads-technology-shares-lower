U.S. stocks erased early gains as
the worst slump for  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  in four years overshadowed
improving economic data and better-than-forecast earnings at
companies including Netflix Inc. and Xerox Corp.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index was little changed at
1,394.66 at 1 p.m. in New York after rallying 0.5 percent
earlier. A gain today would be the seventh straight for the
benchmark index, marking the longest rally since 2006. Apple
slid 11 percent, the most on a closing basis since September
2008, and was the biggest drag on the S&P 500.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
