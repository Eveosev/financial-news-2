Sweden ’s  unemployment  rate
unexpectedly fell in December as domestic demand supported the
labor market amid job cuts by exporters in the Nordic region’s
largest economy.  Seasonally adjusted unemployment  fell to 7.8 percent from
8.1 percent the previous month, the Stockholm-based statistics
office said today. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected an
unchanged rate, according to the median of  eight estimates . The
 non-seasonally adjusted rate  fell to 7.4 percent from 7.5
percent.  Domestic demand still supports the Swedish economy, with
gross domestic product expanding 1.4 percent this year, after
growing 0.8 percent in 2012, Morgan Stanley economists Elga Bartsch and Tomasz Pietrzak said in a note yesterday.  “Lower inflation pressures, faster wage growth and falling
interest rates should boost household finances and encourage
consumption, which we expect to accelerate to 1.7 percent,”
they said.  Even so, Sweden’s export-led economy is hurting as demand
from the recession-hit euro area declines.  Ericsson AB (ERICB) , the
world’s largest maker of mobile phone networks, and truck maker
Volvo AB, are among exporters planning job cuts in Sweden. The
country sells about half of its output abroad, of which about 70
percent go to  Europe .  Sweden’s central bank last month predicted no more interest
rate cuts after reducing its  repo rate  four times since December
2011 to 1 percent. The government last month said the Swedish
economy will recover to 1.1 percent this year from 0.9 percent
in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
