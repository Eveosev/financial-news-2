Poland  raised a record 5.24 billion
zloty ($1.68 billion) from the offering of  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO) ,
its largest lender, selling a bigger stake than planned on
“high” demand.  The Treasury Ministry and state-owned Bank Gospodarstwa
Krajowego sold 153.1 million shares, or a 12.2 percent stake in
PKO at 34.25 zloty apiece, the ministry said on its website late
yesterday. The government’s holding fell to 31.4 percent, while
BGK sold its entire 10.2 percent stake in the biggest share
offering by a publicly traded company on the  Warsaw Stock
Exchange .  Poland is selling assets to curb public debt and finance
state investments. The Treasury Ministry yesterday started a
sale of a 25 percent stake in Warsaw-based property company
Grupa PHN SA in an initial public offering. Other share sales
this year may include utility Energa SA and insurer PZU SA.  “The transaction is positive as it will further improve
PKO’s free float,” Marta Czajkowska-Baldyga, an analyst at KBC
Securities in Warsaw, said in a note today. “The potential
share overhang is limited to 6.39 percent” as the ministry
plans to lower its stake to 25 percent.  Shares Climb  PKO shares  climbed  0.9 percent to 35.07 zloty as of 1:13
p.m. in Warsaw, after falling 1.5 percent to a seven-week low at
the close yesterday. The WIG20 Index fell 0.1 percent today.  The stock’s weighting in the  benchmark WIG20 Index  may be
increased to the 15 percent limit from the present 13.2 percent
in an extraordinary rebalancing in the next few days, Bank
Zachodni WBK SA’s brokerage said in a note today.  The transaction comes six months after the ministry sold
7.6 percent of PKO at 32.5 zloty each. Poland pledged not to
sell more PKO shares within 180 days, it said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The government sold 67 percent of the offered shares to
Polish investors, mainly pension and mutual funds, 24 percent to
U.K.-based buyers, while about 6 percent to U.S. funds, the
ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.  Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, PKO were global
coordinators of the sale. Credit Suisse Group AG, Espirito Santo
Investment Bank, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Ipopema Securities SA
and Societe Generale SA were joint bookrunners.  PKO trades 1.83 times its  book value , above the industry’s
average of 1.55 in eastern  Europe , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Its profit last year was “near” its record 2011
result of 3.81 billion zloty, Chief Executive Officer Zbigniew Jagiello said on Jan. 4.  To contact the reporters on this story:
