Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  fell from the highest level in over six months because
of concern that demand in the  spot market  will wane amid a
winter slowdown in construction.  Rebar for May delivery fell as much as 0.9 percent to 4,018
 yuan  ($646) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange today,
before trading at 4,020 yuan at the 11:30 a.m. local time midday
break. The contract reached 4,067 earlier today, the highest
since July 9.  “The market chose to discount improving manufacturing data
and focused on concern that the rally may have gotten ahead of
itself as the spot lags behind, indicating weak demand during
winter,” Wang Yaoyao, analyst at Huawen Futures Co., said by
phone from Shanghai today.  The average spot  price  of rebar was little changed at 3,729
yuan a ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co. The futures market had jumped close
to 7 percent before today in the past month, while the spot
rebar have advanced by just 3 percent.  The preliminary reading of a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was
51.9 in January, according to a statement from HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics today. That compares with the 51.5 final
reading for December and the 51.7 median estimate of 17 analysts
surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port advanced 1.2 percent to
$147.7 a dry ton yesterday, according to The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
