Polyus Gold International Ltd. (PLZLY)  is
poised for a record one-day surge as billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov ’s Onexim Holdings Ltd. agreed to sell his stake in the
company to a group of investors, according to three people with
knowledge of the plan.  The gold producer jumped 10.4 percent to 220 pence, or
$3.47, by 3:53 p.m. in  London , set for the steepest one-day
advance since Polyus’ U.K. listing in June. Trading volumes were
more than six times the daily average over the past three
months, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Global depositary
receipts  of the company rallied 8.3 percent to $3.41, set for
the highest close since Dec. 18.  Onexim and the investors have requested approval from the
U.K. takeover panel for the deal’s structure, said the people,
who asked not to be identified as the information is
confidential. They didn’t name the buyers for Prokhorov’s 37.8
percent stake in the gold producer.  Prokhorov -- the world’s 68th richest person with a fortune
of $13.6 billion, according to the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index 
-- is selling industrial assets, while holding on to investments
in financial ventures. OAO Gazprom’s unit is buying his Quadra
power utility, the Vedomosti newspaper said this month.  Shares of Polyus’s Moscow-traded unit surged 3.6 percent to
1,134.40 rubles by the close, or $37.74.  To contact the reporters on this story:
