The pound fell to the weakest level
in 11 months versus the euro before data tomorrow that
economists said will show U.K.  gross domestic product  shrank
last quarter.  Sterling declined against most of its 16 major peers after
an industry  report  showed retail-sales growth slowed in January,
adding to signs the economy is struggling to recover. The U.K.
currency dropped to the lowest level in almost five months
versus the dollar. Investors should sell the pound due to “weak
economic fundamentals,” Citigroup Inc. said. Gilts fell,
reversing an earlier advance.  “People are expecting a weak out-turn for U.K. GDP
tomorrow,” said  Paul Robson , a senior currency strategist at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in  London . “It looks like
sterling is taking out stop-losses after its failure to
bounce.” A stop loss is a preset instruction to exit a trade at
a certain level in case a bet goes the wrong way.  The pound depreciated 0.8 percent to 84.76 pence per euro
at 4:35 p.m. London time after sliding to 84.81 pence, the
weakest since Feb. 28. Sterling fell 0.4 percent to $1.5780
after declining to $1.5757, the lowest since Aug. 28.  U.K. GDP contracted 0.1 percent from the third quarter,
when it expanded 0.9 percent, according to the median estimate
of 38 analysts in a Bloomberg survey before tomorrow’s report.  Sales Fall  The gauge of annual retail-sales growth fell to 17 this
month from 19 in December, the  Confederation of British Industry 
said. Stores predict it will slide to 13 in February, the
London-based business lobby said.  “Fundamentals seem to continue to deteriorate while the
safe-haven bid for the pound is apparently gone,” Citigroup
strategists including  Valentin Marinov  in London, wrote today in
a note to clients. “With the U.K. economy already teetering on
the verge of a triple-dip recession and inflation stable,
markets are likely to continue to sell the pound.”  The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for the U.K. is
negative, while that for the euro area is positive, the
strategists said.  The pound has weakened 2.8 percent this year, the second-
worst performer after the yen out of 10 developed-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The euro advanced 2 percent and the dollar gained 0.4 percent.  The 10-year gilt yield rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.01 percent. The 1.75 percent bond
maturing in September 2022 fell 0.17, or 1.70 pounds per 1,000-
pound face amount, to 97.74. The yield earlier dropped as much
as five basis points to 1.94 percent, the  lowest  since Jan. 2.  “We are looking for U.K. GDP to fall back below zero,”
said  Sam Hill , a gilts strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in
London. “Any upward threat to yields will be capped by what is
still a weak macro backdrop.”  Gilts returned 2.7 percent over the past year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bonds rose 4.2 percent and Treasuries gained 2.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
