U.K. stocks  climbed for a second
day, extending the highest level for the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  since
May 2008, as Chinese manufacturing expanded and U.S. jobless
claims unexpectedly fell.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  rallied 3.2 percent after David
Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital Ltd. raised its stake in Europe’s
largest mobile-phone company.  EasyJet (EZJ)  Plc added 5.1 percent
after revenue jumped in the first quarter.  ICAP Plc (IAP)  lost 1
percent after saying U.K. regulators are investigating it as
part of a probe into interest-rate manipulation.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index rose 67.27 points, or 1.1
percent, to 6,264.91 at the close in  London  as all but 22 stocks
gained. The gauge has rallied  6.2 percent  so far this year after
U.S. lawmakers agreed on a compromise budget. The broader FTSE
All-Share Index also advanced 1.1 percent today, while Ireland’s
ISEQ Index increased 1.5 percent.  “The FTSE 100 is clearly gaining the attraction of risk-
loving investors looking to gain exposure to equities,” said
 Angus Campbell , head of market analysis at Capital Spreads in
London.“The buying was also spurred on by a great deal of
economic data from around the globe that was supportive of
stocks.”  In China, manufacturing expanded at the fastest rate in two
years, according to a survey of companies by Markit and HSBC
Holdings Plc. A measure of euro-area services and manufacturing
output contracted at a slower pace this month than economists
had estimated. In the U.S., first-time jobless claims
unexpectedly dropped last week to 330,000, the fewest since the
corresponding week in 2008, the Labor Department reported in
Washington.  Vodafone Stake  Vodafone, which has a 5.2 percent weight in the FTSE 100,
increased 3.2 percent to 168.65 pence.  David Einhorn ’s hedge
fund Greenlight said in a letter dated Jan. 22 that they had
increased their stake in the company, citing Vodafone’s stake in
 Verizon Wireless .  “After achieving an August peak of 192 pence, the shares
ended the year at 154 pence,” Greenlight wrote in its letter.
“At this valuation, it appears that the market is placing no
value on Vodafone’s 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless. The
Verizon Wireless stake is clearly quite valuable.”  EasyJet Revenue  EasyJet gained 5.1 percent to 898.5 pence after Europe’s
second-largest discount carrier reported a 9.2 percent jump in
first-quarter sales to 833 million pounds ($1.32 billion) as
competitors trimmed capacity and the airline added flights to
Switzerland and France.  The airline also said its first-half 2013 pretax loss will
be 50 million pounds to 75 million pounds. Deutsche Bank AG has
estimated a loss of 109 million pounds.  Shares of rival discount airline  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) 
rallied 2.7 percent to 5.40 euros in Dublin.  Croda International Plc (CRDA)  climbed 3.4 percent to 2,437 pence
as JPMorgan Chase & Co. reiterated its overweight
recommendation, the equivalent of a buy rating, saying the
chemical maker is on track to please investors with a “positive
start” in 2013.  Severn Trent Plc and  United Utilities Group Plc (UU/)  added 1.9
percent to 1,635 pence and 4.2 percent to 747.5 pence,
respectively, after Bank of America Corp. upgraded both
companies to neutral from underperform, saying key threats to
the U.K. water industry, including from license reforms by the
Water Services Regulation Authority, or Ofwat, have receded.  Pearson Plc (PSON)  advanced 1.6 percent to 1,187 pence after
Barclays Plc raised its  recommendation  for the shares to equal
weight, a rating similar to hold, from underweight.  ICAP, the world’s biggest broker of transactions between
banks, fell 1 percent to 324 pence. The shares lost as much as
5.9 percent as the company said one of its interdealer-broker
subsidiaries has been notified that it is the subject of an
investigation by the Financial Services Authority.  Earlier, the Financial Times reported that the regulator is
examining whether the company helped manipulate the London
Inter-Bank Offered Rate for the Japanese yen and  U.S. dollar .  To contact the reporter on this story:
