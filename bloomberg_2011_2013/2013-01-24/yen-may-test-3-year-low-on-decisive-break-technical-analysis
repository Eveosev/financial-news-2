The yen may depreciate to the
weakest level in 41 months versus its U.S. counterpart as it
approaches a key level of support, according to Credit Suisse
Group AG, citing technical indicators.  A breach of the support at 90.25 to 90.84 yen to the dollar
may push the Japanese currency to 95, Cilline Bain, a London-
based technical analyst at Credit Suisse AG, wrote today in a
client note. The yen last weakened to this level in August 2009.  Only a “decisive break” past the support zone “would
allow the current upward trend to persist higher,” Bain wrote.
He was not available for comment.  The yen depreciated 1.6 percent to 90.02 per dollar at
11:58 a.m. in New York, its biggest percentage move in a week.  If the yen is able to hold the support level from 90.24 to
90.84, it may appreciate through 87.80 to 85.54, according to
Bain. That would be its strongest level since Dec. 27. Credit
Suisse has a year-end forecast of 81 yen per dollar, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Support refers to an
area where buy orders may be clustered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
