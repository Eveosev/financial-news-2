Diamond Trust Bank Kenya Ltd. (DTKL) , a
Nairobi-based lender with operations in Uganda, Tanzania and
Burundi, slumped the most in six weeks as technical indicators
signalled to some investors the stock was overvalued.  Shares in DTB, as the bank is known, fell 3 percent to 130
shillings by 2:18 p.m. in Kenya’s capital, the steepest decline
since Dec. 10. More than seven times the three-month daily
average volume of shares changed hands, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  DTB’s shares had gained 20 percent from the beginning of
the year until Jan. 18 before a four-day losing streak began
Jan. 19. The stock’s  relative strength index  closed at 80.9 on
Jan. 18; a reading above 70 signals to technical analysts that a
security is overvalued and will probably fall.  “There is a price correction on the stock after the
gains,” Eric Munywoki, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Old
Mutual Securities Ltd., said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
