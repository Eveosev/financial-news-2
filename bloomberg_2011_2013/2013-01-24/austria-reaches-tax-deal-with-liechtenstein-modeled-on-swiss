Austria agreed a deal to tax
Austrian deposits and trusts in Liechtenstein as it seeks to tap
the wealthy for revenue, Finance Minister Maria Fekter said.  The deal, to be signed Jan. 29 in Liechtenstein, will
result in a one-time tax revenue of “some hundreds of millions
of euros,” Fekter told journalists in Vienna today, without
giving details. Austria estimates that there are between 1,000
and 3,000 Liechtenstein trusts that will be subject to tax.  “Liechtenstein-based trusts will not be more attractive
than Austrian-based trusts,” Fekter said. Trusts that don’t
reveal their account holders’ identities will be subject to
penalty rates, she said. “It’s a big step in the direction of
tax justice.”  Austria signed a similar deal with Switzerland last year
whereby undeclared funds faced a one-time tax of 15 percent to
38 percent, with capital gains taxes of 25 percent going
forward. The taxes will be raised in Switzerland and passed on
to Austria without identifying individuals. Austria has said it
expects as much as 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) from the one-
time levy and annual income of 50 million euros.  Austria and Liechtenstein will reveal details of the tax
rates to be imposed on fund holders when the deal is signed,
Fekter said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
