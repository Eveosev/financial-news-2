Opower Inc. , a provider of energy-
monitoring software, says that customers of its more than 80
utility clients will reduce their electricity consumption by 3.5
terawatt-hours through 2014, enough to power the city of
Indianapolis for a year.  The company’s technology has saved about 2 terawatt-hours
of power in the past five years, enough to take a 500,000-person
city off the grid for a year, Arlington, Virginia-based Opower
said today in a statement. As more customers sign on, the
software is expected to reduce power consumption by another 1.5
terawatt-hours in the next 12 to 18 months in six countries
including the U.S., U.K. and  Australia .  Utilities use Opower’s software to identify customers with
unusually high energy-use patterns and notify them by e-mail and
text message. Making people aware of their consumption may
prompt changes in behavior, according to President Alex Laskey.
With global energy usage surging, technology that curbs demand
will be just as important as power generation, he said.  “You need to think about how people use what they use,”
he said yesterday by phone from Davos, Switzerland, where he’s
attending the World Economic Forum annual meeting. The 19th and
20th centuries revolutionized production techniques, and “what
we’re seeing in the 21st century is that there will be big
revolutions in the way we use things.”  Opower’s  utility  customers pay a licensing fee. Using the
technology helps them qualify for state incentives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
