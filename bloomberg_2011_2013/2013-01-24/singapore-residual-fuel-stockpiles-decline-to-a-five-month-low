Residual-fuel inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center,
declined to the lowest in almost five months, according to a
unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Stockpiles including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy residue
and excluding bitumen dropped 790,000 barrels, or 4.3 percent,
to 17.6 million, in the seven days to yesterday, according to
data from  International Enterprise Singapore  released in an e-
mail today. That’s the lowest since the period ended Aug. 29.  Supplies of  light distillate , including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate rose 59,000 barrels from a week ago, or 0.5
percent, to 11.1 million barrels, the data showed.  Middle-distillate inventories including gasoil, or diesel,
and kerosene increased 462,000 barrels, or 4.3 percent, to 11.3
million, the highest in seven weeks, according to the data.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
