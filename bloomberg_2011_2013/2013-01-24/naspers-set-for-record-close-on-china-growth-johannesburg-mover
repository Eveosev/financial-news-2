Naspers Ltd. (NPN) , Africa’s biggest media
group, rose to a record amid signs of accelerating growth in
 China , which accounts for almost three-quarters of profit for
the Cape Town-based company.  The stock gained as much as 2.9 percent to 573.99 rand and
closed at 572.63 rand by 5 p.m. in Johannesburg. The shares have
added 5.4 percent this year, compared with a 3.5 percent advance
in the benchmark FTSE/JSE Africa All-Share  Index. (JALSH)  About 1.8
million Naspers shares were traded, 1.4 times the three-month
daily average.  Chinese manufacturing is expanding at the fastest rate in
two years, according to a private survey of companies,
bolstering prospects that economic growth will accelerate for a
second straight quarter. Naspers owns 34 percent of Hong Kong-
based  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) , which contributed 73 percent of
core headline earnings in the six months ended Sept. 30,
according to Bloomberg calculations based on company filings.  “There have been a number of reports from China about a
pickup in growth, and analysts are starting to include that in
their forecasts” for the company, Abri du Plessis, who helps
manage the equivalent of about $450 million including Naspers
stock at Gryphon Asset Management in Cape Town, said by phone.  The preliminary reading of a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index for
China was 51.9 in January, according to a statement today from
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics. That compares with the
51.5 final reading for December.  Naspers is also benefiting from a decline in the rand, as
the company generates the majority of its revenue in foreign
currencies, Du Plessis said.  The rand declined as much as 0.3 percent today to 9.0878 a
dollar, the weakest level in almost four years. It traded at
9.0542 by 5:11 p.m. in Johannesburg, bringing its retreat this
year to 6.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
