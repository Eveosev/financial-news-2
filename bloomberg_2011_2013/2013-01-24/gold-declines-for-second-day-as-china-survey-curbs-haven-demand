Gold fell for a second day after a
survey showed  China ’s manufacturing growing at the fastest pace
in two years and the International Monetary Fund said global
growth will accelerate this year, curbing haven demand.  Gold for immediate delivery fell as much as 0.2 percent to
$1,681.80 an ounce, and was at $1,683.80 at 10:59 a.m. in
 Singapore  after losing 0.4 percent yesterday. Bullion for
February delivery dropped 0.2 percent to $1,683.30 an ounce on
the Comex in New York.  In China, a private survey of companies from HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics climbed to 51.9 in January, bolstering
prospects that economic growth in the second-largest economy
will accelerate. The world economy will expand 3.5 percent this
year from 3.2 percent in 2012, the IMF said yesterday in an
update of its World Economic Outlook.  “We might see a slowdown in Western demand for gold with
the economic situation looking a little more stable
potentially,” Nick Trevethan, senior commodities strategist at
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said by phone.
“That fear trade is lower in peoples’ minds.”  China’s growth may accelerate to 8 percent in the first
quarter and 8.2 percent in the second quarter, according to the
median estimate compiled by Bloomberg, from 7.9 percent in the
three months ended Dec. 31. The U.S., the world’s biggest
economy, may expand 1.5 percent this quarter and 2.1 percent in
the next three-month period, according to estimates.  Physical purchases from  India , the biggest bullion consumer
in 2011, may slow after it raised import duties on gold and
platinum to 6 percent from 4 percent, Trevethan said by phone.  Cash bullion of 99.99 percent purity fell 0.5 percent to
338.05  yuan  a gram ($1,690.58 an ounce) on the Shanghai Gold
Exchange.  Silver for immediate delivery dropped 0.5 percent to
$32.0925 an ounce. Spot platinum was little changed at $1,685.50
an ounce. Palladium slumped 0.9 percent to $720 an ounce.  To contact the reporter for this story:
