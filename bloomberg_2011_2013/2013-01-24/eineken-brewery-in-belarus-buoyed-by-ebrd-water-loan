The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development is lending the Belarus unit of  Heineken NV (HEIA) , the
world’s third-largest brewer, 5 million euros ($6.7 million) to
support barley farmers and use water more efficiently in its
breweries.  The EBRD said in a statement that the Dutch company would
receive funding for the brewery in Bobruisk, southeast of the
capital Minsk, to upgrade the brewhouse, add eco-friendly
refrigerators and boost high-quality barley production.  The bank is providing 5 million euros in funding for the
Belarus operations of  Europe ’s largest beer producer “mainly to
support the company’s efforts to promote the production of high-
quality barley by local farmers and make a more efficient use of
water and energy in its breweries,” it said yesterday.  Link to EBRD statement:
