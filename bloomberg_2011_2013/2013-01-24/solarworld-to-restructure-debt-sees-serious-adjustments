SolarWorld AG (SWV) ,  Germany ’s biggest
solar-panel maker, said management plans financial restructuring
to remain a going concern in what it called an
“anticompetitive” market.  “Management is of the opinion that serious adjustments on
the debt side are necessary, in particular with regard to the
bonds and the assignable bank loans,” the Bonn-based company
said today in a statement.  SolarWorld reported net debt of 805.2 million euros ($1.08
billion) as of the end of September, raising its debt-to-equity
ratio to 218, more than double the same time a year earlier. The
company has 400 million euros in bonds and loans due in 2016 and
another 400 million due in 2017, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  SolarWorld led groups of manufacturers in complaints
against unfair competition from Chinese companies in the U.S and
 Europe . The company’s chief executive officer said Jan. 3 he
expects the European Union to announce anti-dumping duties as
early as May. The U.S. imposed duties on some Chinese
manufacturers last year.  Reductions in solar subsidies and increased competition
from Chinese manufacturers created a global glut of panels over
the past year and led a group of German panel makers including
Q-Cells SE, Solon SE, Solar Millennium AG and Solarhybrid AG to
seek protection from creditors.  The announcement was released after the end of regular
trading in  Frankfurt . SolarWorld declined 1 percent to 1.60
euros at the close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
