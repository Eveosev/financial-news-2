George Soros , one of the most outspoken critics of Germany’s proposed austerity policies to solve the  European debt crisis , said the euro is here to stay and will gain as other nations seek to devalue their currencies.  Soros, who made $1 billion shorting the British pound in 1992, said that while the causes of the euro crisis haven’t been solved, the acute phase of the turmoil is over.  Germany will always do “the minimum” to preserve the currency, Soros said yesterday at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos, Switzerland. He forecast a “tense” two years for the euro region.  The  Bloomberg Billionaires Index Yields on sovereign debt of countries from Spain to Greece have fallen since European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  announced an as-yet-untapped bond-purchase plan in September last year. Soros, reiterating his view that austerity is the wrong policy at this time, said the German insistence on tight fiscal and monetary policies means the euro will appreciate as other countries pursue more expansive policies, a situation that may lead to a currency war.  “Currencies have been remarkably stable in the last few years,” Soros said. “Now there is the making of more fireworks, more volatility.”  Soros said at the same event last year that the German-led policies risked creating tensions that could destroy the European Union. In a speech in April, he said the Bundesbank,  Germany ’s central bank, was taking steps to limit potential losses if the euro splintered, creating a “self-fulfilling prophecy.”  Japan’s Moves  Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann has denied taking such steps, calling the allegations “ridiculous.”  Weidmann this week criticized moves by  Japan ’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to devalue the yen, saying such measures risked “politicizing” the yen’s exchange rate. Soros said the extent to which Japan can push its currency lower will be limited by what the U.S. is willing to tolerate.  The momentum is for the “euro to rise and yen to fall,” Soros said. “I generally don’t know how far things go but I can see which way they are going.”  Soros said countries can only grow their way out of excessive debt and should avoid policies that lead to contractions. The U.S., the world’s largest economy, has “pretty good underlying dynamics,” he said.  Soros Fortune  “If the fiscal cliff and those issues are resolved, and the  U.S. economy  picks up, I think  interest rates  are likely to rise,” he said.  Soros, who has a $21.2 billion fortune, according to the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index , said there is “definitely” no near-term risk of credit bubbles, a topic that several delegates at the conference discussed yesterday.  “There is an asset bubble in  China  in real estate, sustained by lending in the quasi-banking system,” he said. “The real estate market in China is rising again. That, I think, is a potential bubble because of the source of financing.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Matthew G.
