Ocean Power Technologies Inc. (OPTT) , which
is building the first commercial wave-power plant in the U.S.,
received about $1.5 million in a New Jersey program that helps
unprofitable startups transfer state tax losses.  The program run by the state’s economic development
authority allows some losses to be transferred to profitable
companies and will help Ocean Power continue research and
development of technology that produces power as waves move
buoys tethered to the seabed, the Pennington, New Jersey-based
company said today in a statement.  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG) , New Jersey’s largest
utility, agreed to buy Ocean Power’s tax-loss credits under the
program. Ocean Power is building a 1.5-megawatt power project
about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) off the coast of Reedsport,
 Oregon , and last month said it had an order backlog of $5.2
million as of Oct. 31.  The company reported a  net loss  for the three months ended
Oct. 31 of $4.8 million compared with a net loss of $3.9 million
for the year earlier period.  Ocean Power rose 1.9 percent to $2.12 at the close in  New
York . The shares have declined 15 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
