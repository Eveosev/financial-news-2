Japanese shares  rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average posting its first gain in four days, as
the yen weakened after Chinese manufacturing data raised the
earnings outlook for companies doing business there.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s biggest carmaker, led
exporters higher after the yen fell against the dollar.  Komatsu
Ltd. (6301) , a construction machinery maker that gets 14 percent of
sales from China, gained 2.2 percent after a report said
mainland manufacturing growth beat estimates. Ibiden Co. led
declines by  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  suppliers after the iPhone maker reported
the slowest sales growth since 2009.  The Nikkei 225 rose 1.3 percent to close at 10,620.87 in
 Tokyo . The broader  Topix Index (TPX)  gained 1.1 percent to 897.62,
with all but two of its 33 industry groups rising. Shares
extended gains after Japanese Deputy Economy Minister Yasutoshi
Nishimura said the yen may weaken further.  “The  China  manufacturing data was fantastic and more
confirmation that the Chinese economic recovery is on track,”
said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based head of strategy at AMP Capital
Investors Ltd., which has about $126 billion under management.
“The question is whether that’s fully priced into stocks.”  The Topix has risen 24 percent since elections were
announced on Nov. 14, last week capping its longest weekly
winning streak since 1986 on optimism Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe’s new government will take the necessary steps to fight
deflation. The gauge is trading at 1.06 times book value,
compared with 2.06 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.48
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  China Manufacturing  In China, the preliminary reading of a Purchasing Managers’
Index was 51.9 in January, according to a statement from HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today, beating the 51.7 median
estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. A reading
above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing.  Komatsu rose 2.2 percent to 2,337 yen, while Hitachi
Construction Machinery Co., which gets 17 percent of its sales
from China, increased 1.9 percent to 1,899 yen.  Toyota and other exporters reversed declines as the yen
weakened against the dollar following the release of the China
manufacturing data.  Toyota gained 2.2 percent to 4,245, while  Honda Motor Co. (7267) ,
which gets about 80 percent of its revenue outside Japan, rose 2
percent to 3,350 yen. Sony Corp., the maker of Bravia
televisions and PlayStation game consoles, rose 1.9 percent to
1,189 yen.  Yen Snaps Gains  Japan’s currency halted a three-day gain against the dollar
and extended losses after Deputy Economy Minister Nishimura said
the yen’s correction from strong levels “isn’t over yet.” A
weaker yen boosts the outlook for overseas earnings at Japanese
exporters when repatriated.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3
percent, while Nasdaq 100 Index futures lost 1.5 percent after
Apple reported its slowest profit growth since 2003 and weakest
sales increase in 14 quarters amid rising costs and accelerating
competition with Samsung Electronics Co.  “There’s an impact on the supply chain for Apple but its
offset by the benefits for competitors,” said AMP’s Oliver.
“Apple captured the imagination of ordinary people. When the
upside surprise slows down or isn’t as good as it used to be,
the share price can start subsiding as investors look for
alternatives.”  Apple suppliers in  Japan  fell, with Ibiden, which makes
printed circuit boards, fell 4.7 percent to 1,248 yen. Nissha
Printing Co., which makes touch input panels, lost 2.3 percent
to 1,420 yen.  Utilities Led Declines  Utilities led declines among the Topix’s  industry groups .
Kansai Electric Power Co. dropped 4.4 percent to 836 yen after
public broadcaster NHK cited Nuclear Regulation Authority
Chairman Shunichi Tanaka as saying any nuclear reactors that
fail to meet new safety standards must be shut. Kansai runs the
nation’s only two operating reactors after the rest were powered
down on safety concerns after the 2011 meltdowns.  Among other stocks that fell, Yaskawa Electric Corp.
dropped 4.1 percent, the second-biggest decline on the Topix,
after yesterday reporting operating profit that missed
estimates. Small-precision motor maker Nidec Corp. also sank 0.8
percent to 5,270 yen after lowering its net income forecast by
91 percent.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 5.5 percent
to 21.34, indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.1 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
