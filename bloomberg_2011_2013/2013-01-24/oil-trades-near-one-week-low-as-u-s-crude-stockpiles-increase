Oil climbed after reports pointed to
accelerating global growth and as the spread between West  Texas 
Intermediate crude in the U.S. and  London ’s Brent narrowed on
speculation the Seaway pipeline will soon resume full shipments.  Futures rose 0.8 percent as U.S. jobless benefit  claims 
fell to a five-year low. WTI’s discount to Brent widened
yesterday after  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  said capacity
was limited on Seaway, cutting shipments from the central U.S.
to the  Gulf Coast . An Energy Information Administration report
showed  crude supplies  rose last week.  “The solid data for the U.S. and  China  underlines and
confirms the positive economic outlook,” said  Mike Wittner ,
head of oil-market research for the Americas at  Societe Generale
SA (GLE)  in New York. “The WTI-Brent spread widened a great deal
yesterday because of the Seaway news, but is coming in today.
There’s a feeling any issues will be temporary.”  Crude oil for March delivery gained 72 cents to settle at
$95.95 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures
were down 3 percent from a year earlier. Volume was 33 percent
above the 100-day average.  Brent oil for March settlement increased 48 cents, or 0.4
percent, to end the session at $113.28 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Volume was up 14 percent from
the 100-day average.  The premium of European benchmark contract to WTI narrowed
to $17.33 from $17.57 yesterday. The gap was $15.16 on Jan. 17,
the narrowest in almost six months.  Fewer Applications  Applications for unemployment insurance payments decreased
by 5,000 to 330,000 in the week ended Jan. 19, the fewest since
the same week in 2008, the Labor Department reported today in
 Washington . Economists forecast 355,000 claims, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  The index of U.S. leading indicators rose in December,
showing the economy is poised to keep growing through the first
half of this year. The Conference Board’s gauge of the outlook
for the next three to six months increased 0.5 percent after the
November reading was revised to unchanged from a previously
reported decline, the New York-based group said today.  The improving economic data helped send the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  0.3 percent higher.  China’s manufacturing is expanding bolstering prospects
that economic  growth  will accelerate. The preliminary reading of
a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was 51.9 in January, according to a
statement from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today.
That compares with the 51.5 final reading for December and the
51.7 median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Improving Outlook  “Jobless claims are down and the Chinese PMI is up,” said
Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin,
Texas-based energy consultant. “Most economies are getting
better. Improved economic growth, even if it’s modest, is
positive for crude.”  The U.S. accounted for 21 percent of the world’s oil
consumption in 2011, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of
World Energy. China, the second-biggest crude-consuming country,
was responsible for 11 percent of global demand.  The Seaway pipeline, which runs from Cushing,  Oklahoma , to
Freeport, Texas, on the Gulf Coast, was limited to 175,000
barrels a day at the Jones Creek terminal, according to
Enterprise. The capacity of the line was boosted to 400,000
through an expansion completed on Jan. 11.  ‘Short-Term Hiccup’  “The Seaway developments are unfortunate, but are being
looked at as a short-term hiccup that will be ironed out over
time,” said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at
Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. “We’re already seeing
the spread come in a great deal today.”  Crude inventories at Cushing dropped 471,000 barrels to
51.4 million last week, the first decline since November, the
Energy Information Administration report showed. Supplies
reached a record 51.9 million the previous week.  “Oil isn’t going to be taken out of Cushing at the rate
previously expected because of the Seaway news,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “A lot of traders were caught on the
wrong side of the WTI-Brent trade yesterday. It looks like
yesterday’s move was a bit of an overreaction.”  Nationwide  crude stockpiles  rose 2.81 million barrels to
363.1 million in the week ended Jan. 18, according to the EIA. A
2.15 million-barrel gain was projected, according to the median
of 10 responses in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  Gasoline inventories  declined 1.74 million barrels to 233.3
million. Stockpiles of  distillate fuel , a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, increased 508,000 barrels to 132.9
million. Refineries operated at 83.6 percent of capacity last
week, the lowest level since March, according to the Energy
Department’s statistical arm.  The data was released a day later than usual because of the
Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday on Jan. 21.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 585,771
contracts as of 3:01 p.m. It totaled 950,328 contracts
yesterday, the highest level since Feb. 7. Open interest was
1.51 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
