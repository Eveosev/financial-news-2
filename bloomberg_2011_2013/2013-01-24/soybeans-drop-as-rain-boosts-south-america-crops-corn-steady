Corn rose from a one-week low on
speculation that demand from U.S. makers of biofuel and animal
feed will erode inventories. Soybeans fell.  Ethanol production rose 1 percent in the week ended Jan. 18
and stockpiles dropped 1.4 percent, the Energy Department said
today in a report. In the week ended Jan. 19, domestic chicken
producers increased the number of chicks placed on feed by 1.1
percent from a year earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said yesterday. The government said corn  reserves  on Aug. 31
will fall 39 percent to the lowest in 17 years.  “Ethanol production rose and stocks fell last week, and
that helped to give corn a boost,”  Dan Cekander , the director
of grain-market analysis at Newedge USA LLC in  Chicago , said in
a telephone interview. “Rising animal numbers support
speculation that we have not slowed feed demand. We have yet to
ration what is already projected as a tight U.S. corn supply.”  Corn futures for March delivery rose 0.5 percent to close
at $7.2425 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, prices slipped to $7.145, the lowest since Jan. 14, on
speculation that rain may boost South America production,
reducing overseas demand for U.S. supplies.  Soybeans fell for a second straight day on speculation that
rain forecast during the next two weeks will increase yield
potential for crops in  Brazil  and  Argentina , the biggest
exporters after the U.S.  As much as 2 inches (5.1 centimeters) of  rain  will boost
crops over the next two days in parts of Argentina that have not
received moisture for 17 days, with three more storms expected
during the next two weeks,  QT Weather  in Chicago said in a
report. Brazil will remain favorably wet, the forecaster said.
Combined soybean production by the two countries will rise 28
percent to a record, the USDA said Jan. 11.  Soybean futures for March delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$14.3525 a bushel in Chicago, after touching $14.15, the lowest
since Jan. 16.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
