Dominique Strauss-Kahn , the former
head of the International Monetary Fund charged with acting as a
procurer in a French prostitution ring, has been called back
before a French judge investigating the affair, Le Monde said.  Strauss-Kahn, who lost a bid in December to end the
investigation, will be questioned again today, the newspaper
said, citing sources it didn’t identify. Yesterday, the judges
charged a Belgian man, who runs hostess clubs linked to the
prostitution ring, and his companion with procurement.  Calls to the public prosecutors’ spokeswoman in Lille,
where the investigation is based, and calls and emails to
Strauss-Kahn’s lawyers for comment weren’t immediately returned.  The allegations against Strauss-Kahn are “absurd” and he
has appealed the ruling, according to a December statement from
his lawyers. He has acknowledged participating in sex parties,
while denying he knew the women were paid to take part.  The judges who rejected his appeal on Dec. 19 found the
investigation had gathered enough evidence to determine that
Strauss-Kahn played a decisive role in organizing the events,
providing the facilities at times and specifying the activities
and types of women, Le Figaro said today, citing a copy of the
non-public ruling, without saying how it was obtained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
