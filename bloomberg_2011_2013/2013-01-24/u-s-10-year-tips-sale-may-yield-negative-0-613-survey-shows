The government’s $15 billion auction
of 10-year inflation-indexed notes may draw a yield of negative
0.613 percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey of seven of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary
dealers.  The Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, which mature
in January 2023, yielded negative 0.635 percent in trading
before the auction. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New York  time.  The last offering of 10-year TIPS, a $13 billion sale on
Nov. 21, drew a yield of negative  0.72 percent , the sixth
consecutive time an auction of the securities yielded less than
zero. The record low of negative 0.75 percent was set Sept. 20.  TIPS pay interest at lower rates than nominal Treasuries on
a principal amount that’s linked to the Labor Department’s
consumer price index.  The November sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand
by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was 2.52
versus an average of 2.68 for the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , a category of investor that includes
foreign central banks, bought 48.3 percent of the securities at
the November auction, compared with 43.8 percent at the
September sale. The average for the past 10 offerings is 42.3
percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 10.4 percent of
the notes at the last sale, versus 7.7 percent in September and
an average of 14.8 percent at the past 10 auctions.  TIPS Returns  U.S. inflation-linked debt maturing in 10 or more years
returned 11.8 percent last year, compared with a 7.3 percent
gain in the broader TIPS market and a 2.2 percent advance in the
overall Treasury market, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes.  This year, longer-term inflation-protected Treasuries have
a return of negative 0.81 percent, while all TIPS have lost 0.36
percent. That compares with a negative 0.31 percent for regular
 U.S. government debt  and negative 1.36 percent for securities
maturing in 10 years or longer, the indexes show.  The $15 billion sale matches the record high offering for
10-year TIPS set in January and July of 2012.  Primary dealers trade  government securities  with the
central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
