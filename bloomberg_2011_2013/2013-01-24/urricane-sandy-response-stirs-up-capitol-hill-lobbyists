Lobbyists representing interests
more than a thousand miles from Hurricane Sandy’s landfall
competed with East Coast beach towns and utilities when U.S.
lawmakers drafted their storm-relief legislation.  The Iowa Farm Bureau Federation and Louisiana’s St. Charles
Parish were among at least 150 entities that sought to shape the
cleanup package, according to reports filed for the fourth
quarter of 2012 with the Senate. Much of the lobbying focused on
the Senate version of the legislation, H.R. 1, which wasn’t
considered by the House and expired at the end of the session.  Companies that lobbied on the bill included  Home Depot
Inc. (HD) ;  Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. (DNKN) , the parent company of Dunkin’
Donuts; defense contractor  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ; and  JetBlue
Airways Corp. (JBLU)  They spent a lot of money on their hired advocates
just in case there was a chance to get a special-interest rider
into the legislation; it’s impossible to determine exactly how
much was spent on those losing bets.  The storm devastated a densely populated region along the
Atlantic coast, prompting New Jersey’s Republican Governor  Chris Christie  to try to publicly shame House Speaker  John Boehner 
into moving faster on relief money.  Two-Part Response  Early this month Boehner, an Ohio Republican, offered a
two-part response: an additional $9.7 billion in borrowing
authority for the National Flood Insurance Program to ensure
that Sandy victims were covered, followed by a larger bill that
would provide $50.5 billion in immediate and long-term
assistance to rebuild homes, beaches, transportation and other
infrastructure.  The first measure, H.R. 41, was enacted on Jan. 6. The
House passed the second, H.R. 152, on Jan. 15, and the Senate
may vote on it this week.  Steve Ellis , vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense,
a Washington-based watchdog group that advocates for
transparency in  government spending , described the legislation
as “chum in the water” for lobbyists. “Sixty billion dollars
is no small chunk of change,” he said.  His group also registered as lobbying on the Sandy
legislation, saying it wanted to “eliminate non-emergency
spending” from the Senate version of the bill.  Much of the lobbying was of the “keeping up with the
Joneses” variety, as interest groups wanted to be seen fighting
for their share because everyone else was.  Casino Lobbying  The gaming industry’s priority was to make sure that the
Sandy bill wouldn’t prohibit casinos from qualifying for aid,
said Holly Wetzel, vice president of communications at the
Washington-based American Gaming Association. She said that the
initial measures providing assistance for areas hit by  Hurricane
Katrina , which devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005, barred tax
incentives for gambling operations.  “Our industry learned during the aftermath of Katrina that
we have to be vigilant to ensure that our industry is not
unfairly carved out of any portion of relief legislation because
ours is a casino industry,” Wetzel said.  After lobbying by the group, Wetzel said, the Katrina
prohibition was narrowed to only apply to casino floors.  As for Sandy, while the storm caused some external damage
to casinos, they didn’t suffer significant flooding, she said.  Casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, generate more than
$100 million in monthly revenue, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg Industries.  Infrastructure, Insurance  The Sheet Metal & Air Conditioning Contractors National
Association said on its filing with the Office of the Secretary
of the Senate that it lobbied in “support of incentivizing grid
reliability and building resiliency for critical operations in
the wake of  Hurricane Sandy .”  Congress also heard from Parsons Brinckerhoff Inc., a New
York-based company that provides consulting and engineering for
infrastructure projects, along with the Independent Insurance
Agents & Brokers of America and Allianz of America
Corp./Fireman’s Fund Insurance.  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)  said in its Senate filing that
it wanted to educate lawmakers about the impact on UPS customers
and about the company’s relief efforts. The Jewish Federation of
North America said it was advocating for aid to “non-profits
and places of worship.”  Tax Provisions  Dunkin’ Brands, based in Canton, Massachusetts, disclosed
that it was interested in unspecified tax provisions. Cicely Simpson, vice president of government affairs for Dunkin’
Brands, said in an e-mailed statement that the storm
“temporarily impacted” many of its franchisees’ restaurants.  “While this did not have a material impact on our
earnings, we certainly were able to witness first hand the
impact on small businesspeople,” she said.  Simpson said the company worked with members of the New
York and  New Jersey  delegations “to help convey the
ramifications of the storm to Congress and to help them
understand the importance of relief in getting small business
back on track.”  Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Maryland, said it
lobbied on “provisions related to fire disasters in 2012
including Hurricane Sandy relief.”  Utilities -- including  Consolidated Edison Co. (ED)  of New York,
Charlotte, North Carolina-based  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  and  Houston-
based  CenterPoint Energy Inc. (CNP)  -- also lobbied on the storm aid.  Northeast Groups  Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners LP, which supplies
steam and electric power to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, hired the
firm of Constantinople & Vallone to lobby on “Hurricane Sandy
and long term supply contracts.”  Other groups based in the Northeast that lobbied on the
package included the Greater New York Hospital Association, the
Sergeants Benevolent Association of New York City, the Garden
State Seafood Association and Monmouth University in New Jersey.  Beach towns along the Atlantic coast also hired Washington
lobbyists to speak on their behalf on Capitol Hill. The borough
of Avalon, New Jersey, tapped Marlowe & Co., as did other
coastal governments, including Carolina Beach and Hanover County
in North Carolina and the American Shore and Beach Preservation
Association.  The Iowa Farm Bureau Federation opposed Senate amendments
regarding restoration of livestock and specialty crop disaster
programs, according to its lobbying disclosure filings.  Forest Foundation  The American Forest Foundation reported that its target was
“specifically emergency forest restoration funding” in a
Senate amendment that didn’t make it to the final bill.  Louisiana’s St. Charles Parish was also interested in the
Sandy supplemental appropriations, according to the filings of
its outside lobbyist, Tauzin Consultants, whose partners include
a former congressman, Billy Tauzin.  An early version of the Sandy relief bill included a
provision that would have sped up Army Corps of Engineers
projects in Louisiana’s river parishes, including St. Charles,
to deal with damage from Hurricane Isaac last year and another
that would urge the Federal Emergency Management Agency to
forgive emergency loans from Katrina. Those provisions weren’t
in the version that the House passed.  “It did not happen,” said Brendan O’Connor, the account
manager for the Tauzin firm. “We knew from the beginning it was
a real longshot.”  Among other entities that disclosed that they lobbied or
hired outside firms to lobby on Sandy were the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, the National Association of Homebuilders,  Travelers
Cos. (TRV) ,  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) ,  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) ,
 Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) , the National Cable and
Telecommunications Association,  Pepco Holdings Inc. (POM) , Nevada
Energy, Great Plains Energy, AT&T Services Inc., Yum Brands Inc.
and Colonial Pipeline.  Even Lorillard Tobacco Co. joined the effort to shape the
Sandy bill in the Senate, which has a history of adding off-
topic amendments to legislation. The company’s lobbying firm,
Dickstein Shapiro LLP, listed the Senate’s storm supplemental
appropriations bill as one of its issues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
