Airbus SAS Chief Executive Officer
Fabrice Bregier predicted the A330 wide-body aircraft, which
began service two decades ago, will gain momentum because of
 Boeing Co. (BA) ’s difficulties on its competing 787 Dreamliner.  “Clearly the fact that the new generation comes late and
has teething problems at the beginning means we’ll have more
success with this aircraft,” Bregier said in an interview in
Davos today. The CEO said he doesn’t predict the investigation
of the 787 faults will have a knock-on effect on certification
of Airbus’s A350, as they don’t share the same architecture.  Airbus had so far been wary of exploiting Boeing’s woes for
its own sales campaigns, and Bregier expressed solidarity with
the U.S. manufacturer at a press conference last week, saying
the Dreamliner should return to service as soon as possible.
Airbus has pointed to its own share of technical challenges on
recent programs, including its flagship A380 double-decker
developing cracks in the wing structure.  The Federal Aviation Administration grounded the Dreamliner
Jan. 16 after two lithium ion battery failures, including at
least one battery fire. Even before the second incident, the
agency had announced a comprehensive review of the design,
manufacturing, and assembly of the plane.  Bregier said Airbus will draw the lessons of its own
failures and those of Boeing in developing the A350, which is
set for first flight by the middle of this year and entry into
service before 2015. Like the 787, the wide-body A350 consists
in large parts of lighter composite materials.  Boeing originally brought out the 787 to challenge the
twin-engine A330, which had won three quarters of the market in
its category against Boeing’s 767. Airbus retaliated with the
A350, which targets both the 787, with 270 to 350 seats, and the
larger and popular 777, which can seat as many as 375.  Airbus has sold more A330s since the 787 was introduced
than before. It delivered more than 100 last year and Bregier
today said the Toulouse-based planemaker will continue to
increase deliveries. Airbus has been planning to raise
production to 10 a month from 9, and says it may go higher if
 China  clears approvals for 45 A330s.  To contact the reporters on this story:
