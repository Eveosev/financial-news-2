MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) , which
agreed in October to merge with  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s T-Mobile
USA business, saw its stock jump the most in three months today.  MetroPCS shares rose as much as 5.7 percent to $10.09, the
biggest gain since Oct. 2, before drifting down to close at
$9.73. The stock has declined 2.1 percent this year.  The Richardson, Texas-based company had been the center of
deal discussions with at least eight companies before the
agreement with T-Mobile, raising the possibility that someone
will offer a counterbid to the T-Mobile offer. Chief Executive
Officer Roger Linquist said last month that MetroPCS shares were
undervalued.  While Linquist said he was focused “100 percent” on the
T-Mobile deal, he expected additional mergers to happen in the
industry. “Consolidation has to happen at some point,”
Linquist said in an interview at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
