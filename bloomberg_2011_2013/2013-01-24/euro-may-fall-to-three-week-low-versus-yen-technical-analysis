The euro, which has gained more than
5 percent against the yen this month, may fall fall to the
lowest level in three weeks should it fail to climb above 120.72
yen, Credit Suisse Group AG said, citing trading patterns.  The single currency may find so-called support at 117.05
yen initially, the bank said in an e-mailed note. A decline
below that level may push it toward 113.55, the lowest level
since the end of December.  “Trendline support at 117.05 manages to hold for now,”
wrote researchers including London-based head of  technical
analysis   David Sneddon . “Despite this, while the market remains
capped by 120.72 resistance, our bias remains for the downside
to 113.55.”  The euro will have to rise above key levels of 120.74 yen
and 121.94 yen before it can advance toward 123.35 and then
127.94, the bank said. The 17-nation currency advanced 2 percent
against the yen to 120.40 at 4:55 p.m. London time.  Resistance is an area on a price graph where technical
analysts anticipate sell orders to be clustered. Support refers
to an area where they anticipate buy orders.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a bond,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
