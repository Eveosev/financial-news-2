A  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) 
jet taxiing to its gate at Washington’s Dulles International
Airport today clipped the wing of an aircraft parked nearby.  Flight 951, a  Boeing Co. (BA)  777 that seats about 250
passengers, had just arrived from Brussels when the 2:15 p.m.
incident occurred, Jennifer Dohm, a spokeswoman for the Chicago-
based carrier, said in an e-mailed message.  Passengers and crew left the jet so maintenance workers
could evaluate both aircraft for damage. There weren’t any
passengers on board the parked plane, also a United 777, at an
adjacent gate, she said.  No injuries were reported, Dohm said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
