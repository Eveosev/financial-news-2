-- Grain exports from the French
port of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest wheat-shipping hub, declined 29
percent from a week earlier on reduced Algerian demand.  Shipments totaled 114,223 metric tons in the week through
Jan. 23, against 160,349 tons in the prior period, the  Seine
River port  wrote in an e-mailed report today. Wheat cargoes fell
to 76,485 tons from 126,900 tons. Barley shipments, including
feed and malting varieties, rose 37 percent to 37,738 tons.  Algeria was the top single destination for grain, taking
29,785 tons of wheat. Still, purchases from the North African
country were down from 116,600 tons a week earlier. Shipments
increased within the European Union, with Cyprus taking 21,738
tons of feed barley, and the U.K., Ireland,  Spain ,  Italy  and
 Portugal  each buying some French grain.  Rouen accounted for 41 percent of  France ’s grain exports by
sea in 2010-11, exceeding the 17 percent share for La Pallice on
the Bay of Biscay and Dunkirk on the  North Sea  with 11 percent
of the total, according to port figures.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in metric tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
