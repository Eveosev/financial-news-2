Morgan Stanley gave Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman  a compensation package for
2012 that’s 30 percent less than his 2011 award, excluding a new
incentive package, a person familiar with the decision said.  Gorman, 54, will get  stock options  valued at $2.6 million,
according to a filing yesterday with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. He also will receive a $2.6 million
deferred cash bonus in addition to his $800,000 salary, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because Gorman’s total
pay hasn’t been announced. That totals $6 million, down from
$8.56 million on a comparable basis for 2011.  Morgan Stanley cut 2012 costs 2 percent as revenue climbed
6.9 percent, excluding charges or gains related to changes in
the price of the firm’s own debt. Still, the bank’s return on
equity was 5 percent, below Gorman’s goal of 15 percent.  He’s receiving  options  instead of restricted shares
awarded for 2011 and a new long-term incentive package separate
from his year-end pay that will have a similar structure to the
performance shares he got for 2010 and 2011, the person said.
Even including the package, the size of which hasn’t been
disclosed, his total compensation will be down from the $10.5
million he received for 2011, the person said.  Gorman’s pay trails  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein’s $21 million and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  CEO Jamie Dimon’s $11.5 million. Morgan Stanley’s decision to separate
Gorman’s award based on future performance targets from year-end
pay brings it in line with New York-based Goldman Sachs, which
gave Blankfein such an incentive worth $3 million in February
and a $7 million award the previous year.  Beating Estimates  Morgan Stanley  shares climbed  26 percent last year, after
tumbling 44 percent in 2011. The stock has gained 18 percent in
January, fueled by fourth-quarter results that exceeded
analysts’ estimates and Gorman’s plan to double the firm’s
 return on equity  even without an improvement in markets.  The bank is eliminating 1,700 jobs this month as Gorman
pursues $1.6 billion of annual savings during the next two
years. The New York-based firm is deferring all bonuses for
employees who have both total pay of more than $350,000 and
incentive compensation of at least $50,000, a person briefed on
the matter said earlier this month.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  paid many of its top executives in options
because of a tax rule that limits the deductibility of
compensation for certain officers, except the chief financial
officer, unless the pay qualifies as “performance-based,” the
person said. The rule came into effect because of the firm’s low
level of pretax earnings, the person said. Morgan Stanley had
$515 million of pretax profit in 2012, a figure that was reduced
by $4.4 billion because of charges relating to the firm’s own
debt, known as debt valuation adjustments.  Porat’s Pay  CFO Ruth Porat was awarded 99,835 restricted shares worth
$2.29 million based on the closing price on Jan. 22, the day
they were awarded, according to a separate regulatory filing
yesterday. Last year, she received restricted stock valued at
$3.2 million. Paul Wirth, deputy CFO, received 92,070 restricted
shares valued at $2.12 million.  Colm Kelleher, president of the investment banking and
trading division, received 445,425 options valued at $2.41
million, compared with restricted shares worth $2.54 million for
2011.  Greg Fleming , who runs the brokerage and asset-management
businesses, received 447,888 options worth $2.43 million. Last
year, he received restricted stock units worth $3.4 million.  Chief Operating Officer  Jim Rosenthal  and Chief Risk
Officer Keishi Hotsuki received options valued at $2.03 million
and $1.25 million, respectively. Chief Legal Officer  Eric Grossman  was awarded options worth about $1.83 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
