Gasoline advanced as inventories
fell and as crude oil rallied on reports indicating the  U.S.
economy  is stronger.  Futures rose 1 percent as the Energy Information
Administration reported that gasoline supplies declined 1.74
million barrels to 233.3 million in the week ended Jan. 18, the
first drop in nine weeks. The index of U.S. leading indicators
climbed in December by the most in three months and  jobless
claims  last week sank to a five-year low.  “The inventory report wasn’t particularly bearish and the
economic data continues to provide optimism that the U.S.
economy will improve and hence support petroleum demand,” said
 Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in
 New York .  Gasoline for February delivery rose 2.91 cents to settle at
$2.8629 on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Volume was 12
percent above the 100-day average.  February gasoline and heating oil contracts will expire at
the close of floor trading Jan. 31. The more actively traded
March gasoline contract advanced 2.78 cents to $2.8767 a gallon.  West Texas Intermediate crude for March delivery rose 72
cents to settle at $95.95 a barrel on the Nymex. WTI’s discount
to Brent, the  London  benchmark crude, narrowed 24 cents to
$17.33.  The March gasoline crack spread versus West Texas
Intermediate widened 45 cents to $24.87 a barrel and increased
69 cents to $7.54 against Brent.  The Conference Board’s gauge of the outlook for the next
three to six months rose 0.5 percent after the November reading
was revised to unchanged from a previously reported decline, the
New York-based group said today.  Jobless Claims  Applications for unemployment insurance payments decreased
by 5,000 to 330,000 in the week ended Jan. 19, the fewest since
the same week in 2008, the Labor Department reported today in
 Washington .  Even as total U.S. gasoline supplies fell the most since
Aug. 10, inventories of  reformulated gasoline  for ethanol
blending, or RBOB, in PADD 1, the U.S. East Coast, rose 4.6
percent to 16.2 million barrels, the highest level since June
22, EIA data show.  “Gasoline inventories have gone up huge amounts, Gulf
Coast gasoline stocks are at record levels and blendstock levels
are high,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil market strategist at
Energy Aspects Ltd., a research consulting company in London.
“There is plenty of supply.”  Heating oil for February delivery gained 0.83 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $3.0864 a gallon on the exchange. The March contract
rose 1.12 cents to $3.0764. Volume was 1.4 percent above
average.  U.S.  distillate stockpiles  rose 508,000 barrels in the week
ended Jan. 18 to 132.9 million, the highest level since March
30, according to EIA data.  Diesel Supplies  Supplies of  ultra-low sulfur diesel  jumped 738,000 barrels
to 103.7 million, the most since Feb. 17. Inventories have risen
30 percent in eight weeks.  “The recent builds are a combination of strong refinery
outputs and a lull in import demand from  Latin America ,” said
 Andrew Reed , a principal and oil market analyst with Energy
Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,  Massachusetts . “And
January is the first month in more than a year we have colder
than normal temperatures to support heating oil demand.”  PADD 1  heating oil supplies  rose for the first time in six
weeks, increasing 0.2 percent to 15.4 million barrels, the
department reported. Inventories are 39 percent below a year
earlier.  The  retail price  for regular gasoline, averaged nationwide,
rose 0.5 cent to $3.321 a gallon, AAA said today on its website.
