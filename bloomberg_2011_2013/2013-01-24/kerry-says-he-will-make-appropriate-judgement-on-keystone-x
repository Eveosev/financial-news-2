Senator  John Kerry  said he will make
the “appropriate judgement” on the proposed Keystone XL
pipeline should he be confirmed as secretary of State.  “There is a statutory process with regards to the review
and that is currently ongoing,” Kerry, a Massachusetts
Democrat, said today during his confirmation hearing before the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “It will not be long before
that comes across my desk, and I will make the appropriate
judgements about it.”  There are environmental standards that have to be
considered, he said responding to a question from Senator
 Barbara Boxer , a California Democrat. The lawyers at the
department are skilled “and we will analyze it,” he said. “I
am going to review those standards to ensure they are
complete.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
