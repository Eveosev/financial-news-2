Swiss stocks  climbed to a 4 1/2-year
high as Chinese manufacturing expanded, American jobless claims
fell to a five-year low and the House of Representatives voted
to temporarily suspend the U.S. government’s borrowing limit.  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  paced gains in the Swiss Market
Index, rising more than 1.5 percent.  Logitech International (LOGN)  SA,
the world’s largest maker of computer mice, plunged 9.6 percent
after reporting an unexpected loss. Lonza Group AG retreated 2.8
percent as its earnings forecast missed analyst projections.  The  SMI (SMI)  increased 0.9 percent to 7,457.74 at the close of
trading in Zurich, the highest level since June 5, 2008. The
broader Swiss Performance Index increased 0.8 percent to the
highest since December 2007.  The U.S. House approved legislation to suspend the $16.4
trillion borrowing limit until May 19 late yesterday. The
measure now goes to the Senate, where Majority Leader  Harry Reid 
said lawmakers will pass the bill unchanged and send it to
President  Barack Obama .  “It’s a threat that’s pushed farther away,” said Pierre Mouton, who helps oversee $6 billion as a fund manager at Notz
Stucki & Cie. in Geneva. “This gives lawmakers more time.”  The SMI has rallied 9.3 percent in 2013, the best start to
a year since the index was formed in 1988, after U.S. lawmakers
agreed on a compromise budget. The volume of shares changing
hands in SMI-listed companies was 25 percent greater than the
30-day average today, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  China Economy  China’s manufacturing is expanding at the fastest rate in
two years, according to a private survey of companies. The
preliminary reading of a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was 51.9 in
January, according to a statement from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics today. That compared with the 51.5 final
reading for December and the 51.7 median estimate of 17 analysts
surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  Claims for  jobless benefits  in the U.S. unexpectedly
dropped last week to a five-year low. Applications for
unemployment insurance payments decreased by 5,000 to 330,000 in
the week ended Jan. 19, the Labor Department reported today.  The Conference Board’s index of the U.S. economic outlook
increased 0.5 percent in December, the New York-based group said
today. Economists had projected the gauge would rise 0.4
percent, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  UBS, Switzerland’s biggest bank, rallied 2.5 percent to
16.25 Swiss francs.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , the second-largest,
rose 4 percent to 27.36 francs. Both stocks are at the highest
since July 2011.  Roche Rises  Roche, a maker of cancer drugs, climbed 1.6 percent to
204.50 francs after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approved the company’s Avastin for use with chemotherapy in the
treatment of colorectal cancer. That’s the highest level since
February 2008.  Interroll Holding AG (INRN)  advanced 3.6 percent to 385 francs as
the maker of conveyor belts said full-year net income is likely
to grow by about 5 percent to 10 percent.  Logitech sank 9.6 percent to 6.51 francs, the largest
retreat in three months, as it started selling its remote-
control and video security businesses after posting a third-
quarter loss of $195 million.  Yesterday, the company took a $211 million non-cash
impairment charge on its video conferencing unit. Before that
statement, Logitech was  estimated  to report third-quarter net
income of $50.3 million, according to the average of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Lonza Lower  Lonza (LONN)  slid 2.8 percent to 53.75 francs, the biggest decline
since Oct. 5. Chief Executive Officer Richard Ridinger said a
review of the drug-ingredient maker may result in disposals,
factory mergers and management changes. He forecast growth in
earnings before interest and taxes of about 10 percent this year
to 369 million francs ($396 million), compared with the 413
million-franc average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Acino Holding AG (ACIN)  sank 5.3 percent to 98 francs, the largest
drop since September 2011. The  drug company  said the 2012 margin
for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization will miss its forecast. Postponed product
deliveries due to customer destocking and pricing pressure in
established markets hurt profitability, Acino said in a
 statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
