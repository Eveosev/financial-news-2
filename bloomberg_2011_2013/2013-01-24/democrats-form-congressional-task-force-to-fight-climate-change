Representative  Henry Waxman  of
California, the senior Democrat on the Energy and Commerce
Committee, and Senator  Sheldon Whitehouse  formed a joint task
force on climate change after President Barack Obama vowed to
address the issue during his inaugural address.  Waxman and Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat and chairman
of the oversight subcommittee for the Senate Environment and
Public Works Committee, will co-chair the task force, according
to a  statement  posted online today.  The lawmakers sent a letter to Obama “urging him to
develop a comprehensive climate change plan as expeditiously as
possible,” according to the statement. Obama said in his Jan.
21 address that he’s making climate change a priority in his
second term. The letter was also signed by Representative  Edward
Markey  of Massachusetts, the senior Democrat on the Natural
Resources Committee.  “Congress and the public need to understand that climate
change impacts are turning out worse than expected and our
window to act is closing,” Waxman said in the statement. “This
threat is not waiting until we are ready to deal with it.”  House Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi , a California Democrat,
created the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global
Warming in 2007. Republican lawmakers eliminated the group after
taking control of the House in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
