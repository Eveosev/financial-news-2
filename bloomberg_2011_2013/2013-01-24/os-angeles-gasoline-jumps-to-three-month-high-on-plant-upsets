Spot gasoline in Los Angeles surged
against futures as  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  was said to be shutting
an alkylation unit at its  Southern California  plant next week
and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and  Phillips 66 (PSX)  reported equipment shutdowns.  Valero’s 78,000-barrel-a-day Wilmington refinery near Los
Angeles will shut the alkylation unit for about seven to 10 days
of repairs on a depropanizer, a person familiar with the plans
said.  Bill Day , a spokesman at Valero’s headquarters, said by e-
mail that he couldn’t confirm the planned work.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles
strengthened 22 cents to 20.5 cents a gallon against gasoline
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:49 p.m.
East Coast time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s the
highest level for the fuel since Oct. 15. Prompt-delivery in Los
Angeles rose 24.99 cents to $3.0838 a gallon.  The Wilmington refinery’s alkylation unit was shut Dec. 21
to repair a leak, bringing down the plant’s fluid catalytic
cracker with it. Both units were started last week, and the
cracking unit has “not yet reached planned rates,” Day said.  BP Plc (BP/) , Chevron and  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  are performing maintenance
on process units at their own refineries in Southern California.  The discount for Carbob in  San Francisco  narrowed 12.5
cents to a discount of 3.5 cents a gallon against futures, a
three-week high. Prompt-delivery of the fuel rose 15.49 cents to
$2.8438 a gallon.  Chevron Richmond  Chevron reported a unit shutdown at the 240,000-barrel-a-
day Richmond refinery, Northern California’s largest, a notice
to Contra Costa County regulators showed. Phillips 66’s 76,000-
barrel-a-day Rodeo refinery near San Francisco also shut a unit
Jan. 22, the company said in a regulatory filing.  Tesoro extinguished a “small” motor fire on a maintenance
boat stationed at the wastewater treatment plant at its 170,000-
barrel-a-day Golden Eagle refinery in Northern California, Tina Barbee, a spokeswoman at Tesoro’s headquarters in  San Antonio ,
said by e-mail. The fire had no impact on refinery operations,
she said.  San Francisco Carbob widened its  discount  to  Los Angeles  by
9.5 cents to 24 cents a gallon, the biggest gap since Jan. 14.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles advanced
1.75 cents to a 6.75-cent premium to Nymex heating oil futures.
The same fuel in San Francisco gained 1.25 cents to a premium of
3.75 cents a gallon against futures.  In  Portland , low-sulfur diesel narrowed its discount 2.5
cents to 4 cents a gallon against heating oil futures.
Conventional, 84-octane gasoline there strengthened 10 cents to
13 cents a gallon below the Nymex gasoline contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
