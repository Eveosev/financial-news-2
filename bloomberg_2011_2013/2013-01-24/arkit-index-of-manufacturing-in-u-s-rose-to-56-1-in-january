The Markit Economics  preliminary 
index of U.S. manufacturing increased to 56.1 in January from 54
a month earlier, the London-based group said today.  A reading above 50 in the purchasing managers’ measure
indicates expansion. The  median  forecast in a Bloomberg survey
of economists was 53, with estimates ranging from 52 to 55.3.  Markit’s purchasers figure is based on replies from about
85 percent to 90 percent of those American manufacturers who
respond to a poll of the more than 600 companies.  The Markit gauge of U.S. manufacturing debuted in May 2012.
The company surveys purchasing managers in more than 30

years, bolstering prospects that economic growth will accelerate
for a second straight quarter. The preliminary reading of a
 Purchasing Managers ’ Index was 51.9 in January, according to a
statement from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
