Treasuries fell amid improving
economic data, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index closed
little changed at a five-year high as  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  led a slump in
technology shares after profit growth slowed. The yen weakened
for the first time in four days against the dollar.  Ten-year Treasury  yields  rose three basis points to 1.85
percent at 4 p.m. in  New York . The S&P 500 closed less than 0.1
percent higher at 1,494.82 after earlier topping  1,500 (SPX)  for the
first time since 2007. The index rose for a seventh day, its
longest streak since 2006. Apple sank 12 percent after reporting
the slowest profit growth since 2003. Japan’s currency lost
almost 2 percent to 90.37 per dollar, returning to its weakest
level since 2010. Oil helped lead commodities higher.  Treasuries fell as U.S.  jobless claims  unexpectedly dropped
last week to a five-year low, while the Conference Board’s index
of leading indicators rose in December by the most in three
months in a sign the world’s largest economy is poised to keep
growing. U.S. securities remained lower even after a $15 billion
auction of inflation-indexed 10-year debt drew a negative 0.63
percent yield.  “There’s high demand for some protection -- it tells you
people are willing to pay a lot for that protection,” said
 William Larkin , a fixed-income  money manager  who helps oversee
$500 million at Cabot Money Management Inc. in Salem,
 Massachusetts .  “If you are a foreign central bank and you’ve
got lots of U.S. dollars to invest, TIPS make more sense. At
least you have some protection against inflation.”  TIPS Sales  The last six sales of 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities since January 2012 have drawn negative yield as
investors sought a refuge from inflation amid the  Federal
Reserve ’s efforts to prop up the economy. Indirect bidders, a
group that includes foreign central banks, bought 53.3 percent
of the amount sold today, compared with 48.3 percent in the
prior auction and an average of 42.3 percent for the past 10
auctions.  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  and Xerox Corp.  helped lead  a rally in stocks
that sent the  S&P 500  up as much as 0.5 percent earlier after
reporting better-than-estimated earnings, joining the three-
quarters of S&P 500 companies to top projections so far in the
reporting season.  Netflix, the world’s largest online-video service, rose 44
percent for its  biggest gain  ever after beating its forecast for
fourth-quarter subscriber growth and posting an unexpected
profit. Xerox, the provider of document and business services,
climbed 2.2 percent as earnings beat analyst projections thanks
to a shift away from the traditional printing business.  Apple Watch  Apple, the world’s biggest company by  market value , slid to
a one-year low of $450.50 in its biggest decline since 2008. The
valuation of the shares sank to 10.2 times reported earnings,
the cheapest level in more than 12 years. Apple’s stock accounts
for 14 percent of the Nasdaq-100 and 3.2 percent of the S&P 500.  Fiscal first-quarter profit rose less than 1 percent to
$13.1 billion, or $13.81 a share. Sales climbed 18 percent to
$54.5 billion, compared with 73 percent growth in the same
period a year ago. Apple’s latest results underscored the rising
costs of product overhauls amid competition from Samsung
Electronics Co. in the saturating smartphone market.  The S&P 500 rose to a five-year high in regular trading
yesterday after U.S. lawmakers voted to temporarily suspend the
federal debt limit. The benchmark gauge of American stocks has
climbed 5.1 percent this year. Earnings have beaten the average
analyst estimate at about 75 percent of the 134 companies in the
S&P 500 that released results so far in this reporting season,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The S&P 500 needs to rise 4.7 percent, and the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  must climb 2.5 percent, to reclaim record
highs set in 2007.  Economic Data  Stock futures pared losses before the open of exchanges in
New York after the government jobless-claims data. Applications
for unemployment insurance payments decreased by 5,000 to
330,000 in the week ended Jan. 19, the fewest since the same
week in 2008, the Labor Department said. Economists forecast
355,000 claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey.  Two shares advanced for each that fell in the  Stoxx Europe
600 Index (SXXP) , which added 0.2 percent to an almost two-year high.
 EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  climbed 5.1 percent as Europe’s second-largest
discount carrier said fiscal first-quarter sales gained 9.2
percent.  Opap SA (OPAP)  tumbled 11 percent in Athens as the European
Union’s highest court said Greece’s gambling monopoly is
unlawful.  Logitech International SA (LOGN) , the world’s biggest maker
of computer mice, fell 9.6 percent in Zurich after posting a
third-quarter loss of $195 million.  Commodity Movers  Silver for immediate deliver fell 1.8 percent, the first
drop in nine days, and nickel slipped 0.9 percent. Oil climbed
0.8 percent to $95.95 a barrel and the spread between West Texas
Intermediate crude and London-traded Brent narrowed amid
speculation the Seaway pipeline will soon resume full shipments.  The yen weakened at least 0.9 percent against all 16 major
peers as Japan’s deputy economy minister backed further
declines. A yen at 100 to the dollar wouldn’t be a problem,
Yasutoshi Nishimura said in an interview in  Tokyo , even after
the currency’s 11 percent drop in the past three months.  Nishimura’s “comments reinforce investor expectations that
the Japanese government would like to see dollar-yen extend its
recent correction,”  Lee Hardman , a currency strategist at Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in  London , wrote in a report today.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index fell 0.4 percent as
technology stocks led declines. South Korea’s Kospi index slid
0.8 percent after economic growth data missed estimates and
 North Korea  threatened a nuclear test. Taiwan’s Taiex lost 0.6
percent and the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.8 percent.  The rupee was little changed at 53.6850 per dollar after
falling to as low as 53.8913.  India  increased the limit on
foreign investment in local-currency bonds by $10 billion to $75
billion, the central bank said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
