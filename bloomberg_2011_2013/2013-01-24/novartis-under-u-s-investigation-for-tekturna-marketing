Novartis AG (NOVN) , Europe’s biggest
drugmaker by sales, said U.S. prosecutors are investigating the
company’s marketing of products including the hypertension
medicine Tekturna.  A U.S. unit last year received a subpoena from federal
prosecutors in Louisville,  Kentucky , seeking documents on sales
practices, including payments to health-care providers, for the
drug and other medicines, Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis said
yesterday in a regulatory filing.  Sales expectations for Tekturna, approved by U.S.
regulators in 2007 and called Rasilez overseas, were halved last
year by Novartis after the company scrapped a test of the
medicine among patients with diabetes because some had more
strokes and kidney complications. Revenue from the drug declined
31 percent to $383 million in 2012, Novartis reported yesterday.  Novartis also reported yesterday that in 2012 it received a
civil demand for information from the U.S. attorney’s office in
Manhattan regarding its interactions with specialty
pharmaceuticals concerning products including the cancer
medicine Gleevec and Gilenya, a pill for multiple sclerosis. The
company also disclosed that U.S. prosecutors in  Dallas  are
investigating its Alcon eye-care unit related to the export of
products to Iran and other countries subject to trade sanctions.  The company said it’s cooperating with all the
investigations. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office in
Louisville couldn’t be reached after business hours for comment
on the Tekturna investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
