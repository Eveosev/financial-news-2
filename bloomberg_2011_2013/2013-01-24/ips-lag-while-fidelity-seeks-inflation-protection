Treasuries dropped, pushing 10-year
yields up from almost three-week lows, as claims for jobless
benefits unexpectedly fell to a five-year low and the U.S. sold
$15 billion in inflation-indexed debt at negative yields.  The auction, which drew a yield of negative 0.63 percent,
was the seventh 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Security
sale since January 2012 to yield below zero as investors seek
refuge from inflation amid the Federal Reserve’s efforts to prop
up the economy that pushed its  balance sheet  beyond $3 trillion
for the first time this week. U.S. government debt declined
earlier as applications for unemployment insurance payments
decreased to the least since January 2008, the Labor Department
said today.  “You want to have some presence in TIPS,” said Jim Vogel,
head of agency-debt research at FTN Financial in  Memphis ,
 Tennessee . “It’s a negative return that can turn into a
positive nominal yield if inflation runs ahead of current
expectations.”  Conventional 10-year note  yields  increased three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.85 percent as of 5 p.m.
New York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, after
rising as high as 1.87 percent. The price of the 1.625 percent
note due in November 2022 fell 7/32, or $2.19 per $1,000 face
amount, to 97 31/32.  Treasury trading  volume  rose today to $304 billion in New
York, the highest level since Jan. 17, according to ICAP Plc,
the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government debt. Daily
volume averaged $240 billion in 2012.  Balance Sheet  The Fed pushed its balance sheet beyond $3 trillion for the
first time this week while undertaking open-ended purchases of
Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to combat 7.8 percent
unemployment.  The Fed’s total assets climbed by $48 billion in the past
week to $3.01 trillion as of Jan. 23, according to a release
from the central bank today in Washington. Holdings of
Treasuries climbed by $7.8 billion while mortgage-backed
securities in the Fed portfolio rose by $35.6 billion.  In today’s auctions, indirect bidders, a group that
includes foreign central banks, bought 53.3 percent of the
amount sold today, compared with 48.3 percent in the prior
auction and an average of 42.3 percent for the past 10 auctions.  ‘Some Protection’  “There’s high demand for some protection -- it tells you
people are willing to pay a lot for that protection,” said
William Larkin, a fixed-income money manager who helps oversee
$500 million at Cabot Money Management Inc. in Salem,
 Massachusetts . “If you are a foreign central bank and you’ve
got lots of U.S. dollars to invest, TIPS make more sense. At
least you have some protection against inflation.”  The bid-to-cover ratio, which compares the number of bids
with the amount of securities sold, was 2.71, compared with 2.52
at the previous sale and the highest since 3.01 at the May 2012
auction. Primary dealers bought 35.4 percent, compared with 41.3
in the previous sale. Direct bidders purchased 11.3 percent.  The yield on current 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities was little changed at negative 0.76 percent, compared
with the all-time low auction yield of negative 0.75 percent
reached on Sept. 20.  Initial claims  for jobless benefits decreased by 5,000 to
330,000 in the week ended Jan. 19, the fewest since the same
week in 2008, the Labor Department reported today in  Washington .
Economists forecast 355,000 claims, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  The swings in claims may reflect challenges adjusting the
data during the holiday period and at the start of quarters.
This year’s changes are following patterns seen in prior years,
a Labor Department spokesman said.  Break-Evens  The Fed’s five-year five-year  forward break-even  rate,
which gauges the predicted pace of consumer-price increases from
2018 to 2023, is 2.84 percent. That’s up from 2.43 percent at
the start of September, and compares with an average of 2.55
percent in the six months before the central bank announced on
Sept. 13 it would expand its monthly asset purchases by adding
$40 billion of mortgage securities.  The  difference  between 10-year yields on regular U.S.
government securities and TIPS, known as the 10-year break-even
rate, was 2.53 percentage points compared with the 2.48
percentage point average since the Fed announcement. That
compares with a 2.22 percentage point average in the six months
before the announcement. The average over the past decade is
2.19 percentage points.  The Fed bought $3.357 billion in Treasuries today maturing
from February 2020 to November 2022 as part of its strategy of
purchasing $85 billion of government and mortgage debt each
month to put downward pressure on borrowing costs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
