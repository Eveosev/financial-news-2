PT Gajah Tunggal (GJTL)  is talking to
investors about a sale of five-year dollar-denominated bonds,
moderating Chinese dominance of regional issuance in the U.S.
currency this week.  Gajah Tunggal, an Indonesian tire maker, is considering
pricing the notes in the mid-8 percent area, a person familiar
with the matter said, asking not to be identified because the
terms aren’t set.  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , a Hong Kong-listed
container terminal operator, and Chinese developers  Future Land
Development Holdings Ltd. (1030)  and Mingfa Group International Co. are
also marketing notes, separate people said.  Chinese issuers have sold 58 percent of the $2.95 billion
of bonds offered by issuers from the Asia-Pacific region this
week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on Asian
notes fell 1.4 basis points to 4.08 percent yesterday, 14 basis
points more than a record low of 3.94 percent reached at the end
of November, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  indexes .  “The pace of issuance will remain solid for the next two
weeks, but then quieten down a bit heading into Chinese New
Year,” said Mark Reade, a Hong Kong-based credit desk analyst
at  Credit Agricole SA. (ACA)  The city’s markets are closed for the
holidays from Feb. 11 to Feb. 13 while markets in  China  are shut
the five business days that week.  Secondary Trade  Cosco Pacific is marketing 10-year debt at a spread of
about 285 basis points more than Treasuries, a person familiar
with the matter said. The company, which is selling its notes
through unit Cosco Pacific Finance (2013) Company Ltd., last
issued dollar securities in September 2003 when it raised $300
million selling 5.875 percent notes due October, Bloomberg data
show.  Future Land, a Shanghai-based developer active in the
Yangtze River delta, plans to sell its five-year notes at about
10.25 percent, a person familiar with the matter said. Mingfa, a
real-estate company that focuses on shopping malls, will pay
about 13.25 percent for similar-maturity debt, another person
with knowledge of that sale said.  Fosun International Ltd. (656) , based in  Shanghai , was the only
company in  Asia  to sell dollar notes yesterday, raising $400
million through seven-year 6.875 percent securities, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bonds, which priced at par,
rose as high as 100.4 cents on the dollar as of 9:45 a.m. in
Hong Kong, prices quoted by BNP Paribas SA show.  DBA Telecommunication (Asia) Holdings Ltd. remains in the
market with a five-year bond it is offering to investors at a
yield of about 12 percent, a person familiar with that matter
said today.  Credit Risk  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 108 basis points
as of 8:48 a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The benchmark has ranged from 102.8 to 110.1 this
year, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased one basis point
to 115.5 basis points as of 10:40 a.m. in Sydney, according to
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices. The gauge is set for its highest
close since Jan. 16, CMA prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was also little changed at
141 basis points as of 9:20 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche
Bank AG prices. The measure has ranged from 137.9 basis points
to 148.1 this year, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-
Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
