Korea Gas Corp. (036460) , the world’s biggest
liquefied natural gas importer, slumped to the lowest level in
four months in Seoul trading after the Korea Economic Daily
reported the company may sell new shares.  The state utility sank 4.9 percent to 67,500 won as of
10:02 a.m. on the Korea Exchange, poised for the lowest close
since Sept. 17. The benchmark  Kospi index  slipped 0.4 percent.  Korea Gas may raise 750 billion won ($701 million) by
selling new shares in the second half, the Korea Economic Daily
reported late yesterday, citing unidentified company and
government officials. Nothing has been determined, Song Jae Ho,
a spokesman at the utility, said by telephone today. The
utility, which aims to boost overseas gas exploration and
production, has been facing criticism from lawmakers because of
deteriorating debt ratios.  “There are uncertainties over exact size and timing of a
potential rights offer,” Bum Su Jin, an analyst at Samsung
Securities Co., wrote in a report dated yesterday. “The new
share sale alone won’t have a big effect in improving debt
ratios so that the company is likely to explore other
alternatives” such as selling assets, she said.  Korea Gas shares tumbled 6.8 percent on Jan. 22 after a
report that the company scrapped its plan to sell asset-backed
securities. The utility had earlier tried to sell the securities
with receivables as collateral to lower debt levels.  To contact the reporters on this story:
