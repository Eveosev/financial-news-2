Janus Capital Group Inc. (JNS) , owner of
the Janus, Intech and Perkins funds, reported a 13 percent
decline in profit as clients pulled out money for the 14th
consecutive quarter.  Net income in the three months ended Dec. 31 fell to $31.2
million, or 17 cents a share, from $35.7 million, or 19 cents, a
year earlier, the Denver-based company said today in a
statement. Profit beat the 14-cent average  estimate  of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Mutual fund performance fees remained quite negative,
though that was offset somewhat by a big upstep in performance
fees at Intech,”  Michael Kim , an analyst with Sandler O’Neill &
Partners LP in  New York , said in an interview. Intech uses
mathematical models to choose securities.  Chief Executive Officer Richard M. Weil has worked to
reduce Janus’s dependence on equities, strengthening his fixed-
income team and planning the introduction of multi-asset
products known as absolute-return funds, as investors have
shunned stocks for bonds. Poor long-term fund performance led to
continued withdrawals and lower fees, even as Janus’s fixed-
income investments reached $26.4 billion, or about 17 percent of
total assets.  Janus fell 1.8 percent to close at $9.65 in New York. The
 shares  are up 13 percent this year, compared with the 9.4
percent gain by the Standard & Poor’s 20-company index of asset
managers and custody banks.  Fund Redemptions  Assets increased 5.8 percent from a year earlier to $156.8
billion as global stocks rose 13 percent in 2012, based on the
MSCI AC World Index. Clients withdrew a net $3.6 billion in the
quarter, excluding  money market funds . Only fixed-income
products attracted money, with about $700 million in net
deposits.  While assets rose, Janus earned less in investment-related
fees because of performance measures that reduce fees when funds
fail to meet their benchmarks over trailing periods of 12 to 36
months. Negative performance fees cost Janus $13.6 million in
the quarter and $75.4 million in 2012. Fees from mutual funds
were reduced $21.9 million in the quarter because of
underperformance.  “We expect this level of negative performance fees to
continue for the next several quarters,” Chief Financial
Officer Bruce Koepfgen said during a conference call with
analysts, referring to mutual fund fees.  Compensation Expenses  Revenue rose 0.5 percent to $216.6 million. Expenses
climbed 9.4 percent to $158.6 million, driven by an 11 percent
jump in compensation and incentive pay. Pay dropped 7.1 percent
compared with the third-quarter of 2012 after the company
lowered pay to senior executives.  Janus repurchased 293,100 shares of common stock during the
fourth quarter at a total cost of $2.6 million.  Weil struck a deal in August with Tokyo-based insurer  Dai-
ichi Life Insurance Co. (8750)  that has helped support the firm’s
shares.  Japan ’s second-largest life insurer agreed to purchase
15 percent to 20 percent of Janus shares within a year, invest
$2 billion in the funds and help distribute them in Japan.  Dai-ichi held 19.9 percent as of Dec. 4, according to a
regulatory  filing . The company, which had options priced at
$10.25 a share, bought the entire holding at lower prices on the
open market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
