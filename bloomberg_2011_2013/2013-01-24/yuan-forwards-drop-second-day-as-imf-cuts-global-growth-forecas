Yuan  forwards dropped for a second
day after the central bank lowered its daily currency fixing and
the  International Monetary Fund  cut global growth forecasts.  The People’s Bank of China set the  reference rate  0.03
percent weaker at 6.2783 per dollar today. The IMF said
yesterday it expects 3.5 percent growth this year, less than an
October forecast of 3.6 percent. It maintained its China
estimates at 8.2 percent for this year and 8.5 percent in 2014,
before data today that suggested the nation’s manufacturing is
expanding at the fastest rate in two years.  “Investors are turning a bit cautious about the impact on
China due to the uncertain global growth outlook,” said Stella
Lee, president at Success Wealth Management Ltd. in  Hong Kong .
“The yuan won’t fall much, but gains will be limited in the
near term.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.1 percent to
6.2870 per dollar as of 10:11 a.m. in Hong Kong, a 1.1 percent
discount to the onshore spot rate, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The currency weakened 0.06 percent to 6.2070 in Hong
Kong’s offshore market, sliding for a fifth day.  In Shanghai, the yuan slipped 0.02 percent to 6.2192 per
dollar, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either
side of the central bank’s fixing.  A preliminary reading for a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index that
gauges Chinese manufacturing was 51.9 this month, from 51.5 in
December, according to HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics. A
figure above 50 indicates expansion.  China’s new risk is how to prevent overheating, which would
stoke inflation and asset bubbles,  Fan Gang , a former central
bank adviser, said yesterday in an interview in Davos,
 Switzerland . Fan said he sees “modest” appreciation in the
yuan against the dollar as money flows in from other countries.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, fell three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.28 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
