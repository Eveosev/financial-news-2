Denmark’s recovery is faltering and
risks to growth are on the “downside” because of the Nordic
nation’s close ties to the euro area, the  International Monetary
Fund  said.  The Danish economy will grow 0.9 percent in 2013, short of
the government’s own 1.2 percentage estimate, the Washington-
based IMF said in a Dec. 20 report published today, following an
annual review in November. Denmark’s economy probably contracted
0.4 percent in 2012, the IMF said.  The Danish economy is struggling to emerge from a burst
property bubble in 2008 that triggered a local banking crisis
and wiped out more than a dozen lenders.  A “further slowdown or renewed recession in major trade
partners, especially in the euro area, could weigh heavily on
Danish exports,” the IMF said. “Renewed financial turmoil
could raise funding costs for banks reliant on wholesale
funding; a further decline in housing prices could put pressure
on banks and households and depress still-weak private
consumption.”  Denmark is working on a plan to aid its businesses without
putting pressure on a public budget that’s already stretched to
its limits, Economy Minister  Margrethe Vestager  said last week.  The IMF urged the government to “prepare contingency plans
to support the economy” if growth weakened further or corporate
and municipal investments slid. Denmark is well-positioned to
address policy issues given its AAA credit rating and public
debt of about 50 percent of gross domestic product, the IMF
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
