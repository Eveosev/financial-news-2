Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) ,
 Australia ’s third-largest iron-ore producer, expects to narrow
the list of potential buyers for a stake in its rail and port
infrastructure assets within four or five weeks.  “We’ve had very, very strong interest and we’ve begun the
process of engaging with the selected proponents to work through
the details,” Neville Power, chief executive officer of the
Perth-based company, told reporters today on a call after
reporting a 32 percent rise in second-quarter shipments. “We
would expect to have a shortlisting of that in the next four
weeks or five weeks or so and then we’ll give an update.”  Fortescue started talks last month to sell a minority stake
in the rail and port operations in Western Australia state and
hired  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)  and Macquarie Group Ltd. as financial advisers.
The company may sell as much as 40 percent of the assets for as
much as $4 billion, Michael Evans, a Sydney-based analyst at
CIMB Securities (Australia) Ltd., said in a Jan. 4 report.  Atlas Iron Ltd., billionaire  Gina Rinehart ’s Hancock
Prospecting Pty and offshore pension funds may be interested in
buying a stake, Chris Drew, a Sydney-based analyst with RBC
Capital Markets, said last month.  The company said in December it would restart an expansion
to boost output to 155 million metric tons a year after prices
rose, driven by demand from  China . It cut spending, sold assets
and cut jobs in September after prices fell to a three-year low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
