JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the lender
that lost more than $6.2 billion last year from wrong-way bets
on  credit derivatives , named Cindy Armine as chief compliance
officer.  Armine will replace Martha Gallo, according to New York-
based JPMorgan.  Armine joined the firm in May 2011 as chief control officer
of home lending after 31 years at Citigroup Inc., where she was
chief compliance officer. Armine was hired, in part, to oversee
a consent agreement reached with U.S. regulators in April over
foreclosure practices. The accord was signed by 13 other banks.  JPMorgan, in a 129-page report detailing its biggest ever
trading loss, said employees were overwhelmed by the complexity
of their bets, risk managers were ill-equipped and leaders
including Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  werenâ€™t aggressive
enough in responding. The report was issued Jan. 16, the same
day the bank posted a $5.69 billion fourth-quarter profit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
