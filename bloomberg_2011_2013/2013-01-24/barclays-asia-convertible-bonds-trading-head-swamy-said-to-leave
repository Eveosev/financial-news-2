Pradeep Swamy, head of convertible
bonds trading in  Asia  for  Barclays Plc (BARC) , has left the bank, two
people with knowledge of the matter said.  Swamy was a managing director based in Hong Kong, said the
people, asking not to be identified because the information is
private. Timothy Cuffe, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for
Barclays, declined to comment on the departure. A call made to
Swamy’s mobile phone wasn’t answered.  Britain’s second-largest bank is cutting about 70 jobs, or
at least 15 percent of its investment banking headcount in Asia
starting this week, two people with knowledge of the matter said
today. Barclays ranked no. 12 among underwriters of equity-
linked securities in the Asia-Pacific region last year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
