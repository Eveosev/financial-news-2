Hong Kong’s subway system, operated
by  MTR Corp. (66) , was disrupted for about two and a half hours
because of an equipment fire at a station.  Services resumed at 1:04 p.m. local time, MTR said in a
statement on its website. The company issued an announcement on
the disruption at 10:33 a.m.  A structure at the platform door caught fire, Sam Hui, a
spokesman of the city’s fire services department, said by
telephone. About 300 people were evacuated, Hui said.  “It is believed that faulty installation in the supporting
frame for one set of platform screen door caused smoke when the
door was operated,” said Francis Li, operations head at MTR.
The company will conduct further inspections to check similar
equipment, he said.  The fire services department categorized the incident as
“no. 2 alarm,” according to a statement on the government’s
Information Services Department website. The fire was
categorized as such because it occurred at a place with many
people, Hui said.  MTR fell 1 percent to HK$31 as of 3:36p.m. in  Hong Kong 
trading, after earlier declining as much as 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
