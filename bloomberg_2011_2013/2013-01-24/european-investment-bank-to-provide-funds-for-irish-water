The  European Investment Bank  will
provide 200 million euros ($267 million) in funds to help
improve Ireland’s water infrastructure, including the
replacement of water mains in Dublin, the bank said today.  “Investment in the Irish water infrastructure will
significantly enhance water conservation measures, improve
drinking water quality and reduce risks of pollution,” European
Investment Bank Vice President Jonathan Taylor said today in an
e-mailed statement.  Ireland’s environment minister Phil Hogan said the
improvements from the 25-year EIB loan for 23 projects will cut
Irish losses in water networks, benefit households and help
attract industries with high-water usage “such as agri-food,
pharma-chem and IT.”  The water initiative includes replacing more than 300
kilometers (186 miles) of water mains in Dublin, South
Tipperary, Galway and Limerick. Reforms in the Irish water
sector will also increase the drinking water supply through two
new reservoirs in Kerry and North Tipperary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
