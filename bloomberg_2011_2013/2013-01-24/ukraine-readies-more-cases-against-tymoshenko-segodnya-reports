Ukraine is preparing more criminal
cases against jailed former Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko in
addition to a probable murder charge, the  Segodnya  newspaper
reported, citing First Deputy Prosecutor General Renat Kuzmin.  Prosecutors have informed Tymoshenkoâ€™s lawyers of probes
into alleged bribery of a judge, misuse of carbon-permit sales
proceeds, physical damage at a remand center where her husband
was detained and irregularities in ambulance purchases when she
was premier, Segodnya cited Kuzmin as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
