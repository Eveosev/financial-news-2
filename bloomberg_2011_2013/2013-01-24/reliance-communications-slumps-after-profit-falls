Reliance Communications Ltd. (RCOM) ,
 India ’s third-largest mobile-phone company by subscribers,
dropped the most in 17 months in Mumbai trading after profit
missed analysts’ estimates on higher finance costs.  The  shares  slumped 9.1 percent, the most since August 2011,
to 80 rupees. Third-quarter  net income  fell 44 percent to 1.05
billion rupees ($19.5 million), Reliance Communications said
yesterday. That missed the 1.62 billion-rupee median of 16
 analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Billionaire  Anil Ambani ’s flagship company posted its
second consecutive quarterly decline in profit after finance
costs surged 59 percent. The drop in profit margins quarter-on-
quarter is disappointing, according to Urmil Shah, an analyst at
Kim Eng Securities India Pvt. in Mumbai.  “We remain negative on Reliance Communications due to lack
of earnings growth, high net debt and low internal  cash flow ,”
Shah, who maintained his sell recommendation on the stock, wrote
in a note to clients today. “We don’t expect substantial
improvement in 4Q and in FY14.”  The company’s margin, which represents earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization as a proportion of
sales, declined to 31.02 percent in the three months ended Dec.
31 from 31.66 percent in the previous quarter, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
