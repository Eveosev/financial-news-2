Pedro Martinez , a three-time Cy
Young Award winner who helped the Boston  Red Sox  end an 86-year
World Series drought, rejoined the organization as a special
assistant to General Manager  Ben Cherington .  Martinez spent seven Major League Baseball seasons with the
Red Sox, from 1998 through 2004, compiling a 117-37 record with
a 2.52 earned run average while winning two Cy Young Awards as
the best pitcher in the American League. The Red Sox won the
World Series in his final year, their first title since 1918.  In his new role, Martinez will be involved in player
evaluation, mentorship and instruction at spring training and
through the season, the Red Sox said in a  statement . Former Red
Sox catcher  Jason Varitek  took a similar post with the team’s
baseball operations staff in September.  “I am thrilled to be returning to this organization and to
the city I love,” Martinez, who retired in 2009 after 18 major-
league seasons, said in a statement. “It is an honor to be back
with the Red Sox and help in any way I can.”  The Red Sox went 69-93 in 2012, their worst record since
1965.  To contact the reporter on this story:
