EasyJet Plc (EZJ) ,  Europe ’s second-largest
discount carrier, said sales gained in the three months through
December as competitors trimmed capacity and the airline added
flights to Switzerland and  France .  Revenue jumped 9.2 percent to 833 million pounds ($1.32
billion) in the fiscal first quarter, the company said in a
statement. The airline said its first-half 2013 pretax loss will
be 50 million pounds to 75 million pounds. Deutsche Bank AG has
estimated a loss by that measure of 109 million pounds. The
stock rose as much as 5.7 percent to a record.  Chief Executive Officer Carolyn McCall has boosted
frequencies on key routes while using allocated seating,
flexible tickets and corporate agents to grab a bigger slice of
the business market. EasyJet lured 10 million corporate
travelers in 2012 and will begin flying between Moscow and
 London , as well as from Milan to  Rome ’s Fiumicino airport, this
year. Sales per available seat rose 8 percent to 53.87 pounds.  EasyJet got an “impressive” amount of revenue per seat,
Neil Glynn and Hugo Turner, analysts at Credit Suisse, wrote in
a note to investors today. “Trading momentum has remained
strong into winter.”  The stock closed 5.1 percent higher at 898.5 pence in
London, having touched the highest level since the Luton,
England-based company’s initial public offering in 2000. EasyJet
shares have more than doubled in the past 12 months.  Expansion Dispute  The carrier said it’s targeting “prudent” capacity
increases of 3 percent to 5 percent as it develops a proposal to
present to shareholders on aircraft deliveries after 2017 and
fleet management between 2015 and 2017.  Founder  Stelios Haji-Ioannou  cut his holding earlier this
week for the first time since 2004 and threatened to sell more
shares if EasyJet pursues an aircraft order. The entrepreneur,
whose family controls almost 37 percent of the stock, said he
wants management to target a 10 percent profit margin and boost
dividend payouts to 50 percent, up from one-third.  “While we support fleet upgrades, our concern lies in
uncertainty over pricing and the reaction of the major
shareholder,” James Hollins, an analyst at Investec, said in a
note to investors today. “A recent stock sale around this issue
led to a share price dip and risk remains of further action.”  ‘Under Way’  Talks and evaluation of aircraft are “well under way,”
the company said, adding that EasyJet may exercise options to
buy three A320s to ensure it has capacity for summer 2014.
Newer, more fuel efficient aircraft will improve the airline’s
cost advantage over competitors and help it retain better
positions at airports, EasyJet said today.  The airline took delivery of two Airbus A320 planes and
returned three to lessors during the quarter, giving it a total
of 213 planes at the end of 2012. The average age was about 4.5
years.  EasyJet expanded capacity in  Switzerland  and France by 14
and 10 percent respectively during the quarter, while cutting
flights to and from  Spain . Competitors flying on the low-cost
carrier’s routes trimmed capacity by 800,000 seats, EasyJet
said. Destinations added this winter include Luxembourg and
Turin,  Italy .  The total passenger count increased 6.2 percent to 13.7
million, boosting EasyJet’s load factor, a measure of occupancy,
to 88.6 percent. Some 80 percent of  available  seats have already
been sold for the first half.  Disruption caused by weather or industrial action forced
the cancellation of 64 flights in the last three months of 2012,
compared with 236 a year earlier, the airline said. EasyJet
canceled more than 200 flights, mainly in France and
Switzerland, which cost the airline about 1.5 million pounds,
last weekend. That figure isn’t included in the first-quarter
results,  Paul Moore , a spokesman, said by e-mail.  Larger rival  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  will report third-quarter
results on Jan. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
