Noble Corp. (NE) , the offshore drilling
contractor building 11 new rigs, fell the most in seven months
after forecasting costs higher than analysts expected.  Noble fell 6 percent to $37.46 at the close in New York,
the biggest drop since June 21.  Contract drilling costs for the Geneva-based company this
year are projected to be in the range of $2.05 billion to $2.15
billion, an increase of as much as 19 percent compared to the
$1.8 billion in expenses last year, Chief Financial Officer
James Maclennan told analysts and investors today on a
conference call.  “The cost guidance for 2013 is obviously disappointing,”
John Keller, an analyst at Stephens Inc. in Houston, said in a
phone interview today. He rates the shares at overweight, which
means investors should buy the stock, and owns none. “This is
the second quarter in a row they’ve missed earnings on costs.”  Noble reported fourth-quarter earnings of 50 cents a share,
10 cents lower than the  average  of 17 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The company reported contract drilling
costs for the quarter of $484 million, which was 6 percent
higher than the $458 million expected by J. David Anderson, an
analyst at JP Morgan Chase and Co., according to a note he sent
to investors.  “Our operational performance was a significant
disappointment in 2012,” Chief Executive Officer David Williams
said on the call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
