NeSa Energy, a Turkish developer
with plans to build a 130-million euro ($173 million) wind farm
in Macedonia, will begin work on the venture in July.  The 110-megawatt plant will take about two years to finish,
Ali Samra, an owner of NeSa, said by e-mail. “We are in touch
with some bank and finance groups for financing the project,”
he said. “We are working to agree with one of them.”  The company signed an agreement to build the 44-turbine
project, subject to conditions such as wind-speed verification,
with southern Macedonia’s Bogdanci municipality on Jan. 17.  The park will receive preferential rates for producing
clean power, or a so-called feed-in tariff, Samra said.  Macedonia, formerly part of  Yugoslavia , plans to get about
21 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 as it
seeks to join the European Union. The Balkan nation applied for
membership in March 2004 and has been a candidate since 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
