Morgan Stanley raised its forecast
for iron ore prices this year on expectations that accelerating
economic growth in  China , the biggest buyer, will boost demand.  Prices will average $133 a ton this year, 11 percent more
than a previous estimate, analysts  Peter Richardson  and Joel Crane wrote in a report today. Prices may average $142 in the
first quarter and fall to $125 in the third, they said.  Iron ore has climbed 70 percent since dropping to a three-
year low in September as  China’s economy  rebounded from a seven-
quarter slowdown and mills restocked reserves. Morgan Stanley
joins Bank of America Corp., Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase
& Co. in predicting prices will decline in the second half as
supply increases. The recent rally to the highest price in 15
months is unsustainable, Bank of America said this week.  “We continue to see trends of demand recovery in the
property sector,” Morgan Stanley said, referring to demand for
steel. Current prices won’t be sustained “indefinitely” as
Chinese  restocking  ahead of the Lunar New Year is almost
complete, supply disruptions ease with better weather conditions
and Australian production increases, it said. China’s markets
will be shut from Feb. 11 through Feb. 15 for the holiday.  Global seaborne demand will increase 8.3 percent this year,
with China boosting purchases 12 percent, Morgan Stanley
estimates.  Iron ore  with 62 percent content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin rose 1.2 percent to $147.70 a dry ton yesterday,
according to  data  from The Steel Index Ltd. Prices reached
$158.50 on Jan. 8, the highest since October 2011. Iron ore is
measured in dry tons, or metric tons less moisture. At Tianjin
port moisture can account for 8 percent to 10 percent of the
ore’s weight.  To contact the reporter for this story:
