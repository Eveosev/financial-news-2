The Canadian dollar fell to an
almost 10-week low versus its U.S. counterpart as the Bank of
Canada’s reduced growth forecast and less emphasis on raising
interest rates weighed on investor optimism on the economy.  The currency traded below parity for a second day after the
central bank cut its forecast for growth this year to 2 percent
from an October forecast of 2.3 percent. Canada’s dollar also
dropped below its 200-day moving average versus the greenback
for a second day.  “There’s been a follow-through and more digestion after
those comments from the BOC yesterday,”  Greg Moore , a currency
strategist at  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , said in a telephone
interview. “The comments were certainly more dovish than anyone
was really expecting.”  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, depreciated 0.2 percent to
C$1.0013 per U.S. dollar after earlier falling to C$1.0025, its
lowest level since Nov. 16. One Canadian dollar purchases 99.87
U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
