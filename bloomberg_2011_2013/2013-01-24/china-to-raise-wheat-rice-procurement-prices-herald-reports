China will encourage the
consolidation of fragmented rural land holdings and raise
minimum state procurement prices of wheat and rice this year,
the 21st Century Business Herald reported, citing an annual
government  policy paper .  The government will adjust import and export duties as
necessary and diversify sources from overseas as it continues to
boost supplies of agricultural products and will stockpile corn,
soybeans, rapeseed, cotton and sugar when required, the
newspaper said, citing the Communist Party’s “No. 1 Document,”
which has yet to be released.  The government will still help family-run farm businesses
and aims to channel urban capital into area such as food-
processing rather than into industrial-style farms, the
newspaper said, citing  Chen Xiwen , deputy head of the Central
Rural Work Leading Group under the State Council.  To allow for the migration of freed-up rural labor to urban
areas, the government will loosen restrictions over residency
rights and set minimum standards for wages, public health,
family planning and housing, the newspaper reported, citing the
document.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: William Bi in
