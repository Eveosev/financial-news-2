day during the week ending January 18, 2013, 895 thousand
barrels per day below the previous weekâ€™s average. Refineries
operated at 83.6 percent of their operable capacity last week.
However, gasoline production increased last week, averaging 8.9
million barrels per day. Distillate fuel production decreased
last week, averaging over 4.3 million barrels per day.  U.S. crude oil imports averaged over 7.7 million barrels per day
last week, down by 300 thousand barrels per day from the
previous week. Over the last four weeks, crude oil imports have
