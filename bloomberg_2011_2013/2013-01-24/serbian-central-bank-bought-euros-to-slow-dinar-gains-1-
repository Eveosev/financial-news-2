Serbian central bank bought euros
for the first time since October to slow gains in the dinar.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije purchased 5 million
euros ($6.68 million) from commercial banks today to “smooth
the dinar’s intraday swings,” the regulator said on its  website 
without giving any further details.  Three currency traders in Belgrade who asked to remain
unidentified, in line with the policies of their banks, said the
central bank was buying euros at levels between 111.35 and
111.65 dinars after the dinar strengthened to 110.7652 to the
euro by 10 a.m., appreciating almost 0.8 percent on the day.  The dinar has advanced because of tight monetary policy,
with the central bank raising its  benchmark interest rate  seven
times since June by a total of 200 basis points, or 2 percentage
points, to 11.5 percent, to bring inflation back to the target
of 4 percent, plus or minus 1.5 percentage points by the end of
2013. The inflation rate stood at 12.2 percent in December.  Banks priced the dinar at 111.3142 at 5:36 p.m. in
Belgrade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank last bought 5 million euros on Oct. 15 to
curb the currency’s appreciation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
