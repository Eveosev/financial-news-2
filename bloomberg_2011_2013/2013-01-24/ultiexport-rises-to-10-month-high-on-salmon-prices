Multiexport Foods SA (MULTIFOO)  advanced to a
10-month high as salmon prices rose and after Chilean newspaper
Diario Financiero reported that local investment funds had
started to increase their holdings of fish farmer shares.  Multiexport climbed 3.8 percent to 144 pesos at the close
in Santiago, its highest level since March 22. Other salmon
farmers also advanced, with  Australis Seafoods SA (AUSTRALI)  gaining 2.1
percent,  AquaChile SA (AQUACHIL)  increasing 0.3 percent and Cia. Pesquera
Camanchaca SA rising 0.3 percent.  Salmon prices in Norway increased last week to 34.76 kroner
per kilogram, the highest since June 2011,  Statistics Norway 
said yesterday. Diario Financiero reported today that several
investment fund managers including Compass Group Chile AGF and
BICE Inversiones AGF have been increasing their holdings of
shares in several salmon farmers. The newspaper cited data from
Chile’s securities regulator.  “The stocks are rising in line with salmon prices,”
Andres Galarce, an equity analyst at EuroAmerica Corredores de
Bolsa SA, said. “The funds’ buying can also be seen as a sign
that the market is starting to trust again in the companies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
