U.S. exporters sold 510,000 metric
tons of soybeans to  China , the biggest global consumer, for
delivery in the 12 months that start Sept. 1, the Department of
Agriculture said today in a  statement .  Sales were the largest single day purchase of U.S. supplies
since Feb. 17 when China bought a record 2.923 million tons,
USDA  data  show. China canceled 1.155 million tons of purchases
for delivery before Sept. 1 in three separate announcements from
Dec. 18 to Jan. 3, the USDA said. Soybeans fell 1 percent to
$14.22 a bushel at 9:59 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade, down
21 percent from a record $17.89 in September.  China has received 15.555 million metric tons of U.S.
soybeans since Sept. 1, up 25 percent from a year earlier as of
Jan. 10, the USDA said last week. The Asian country has yet to
transport 4.102 million tons of purchases made earlier. China
will boost  imports  from all countries by 6.4 percent to a record
63 million tons, the USDA said Jan. 11.  “Chinese crushing margins have improved, and they have
become more active buyers with the drop in prices,”  Bill Nelson , a senior economist at Doane Advisory Services Co. in  St.
Louis , said in a telephone interview.  The government also reported today that 113,000 tons were
sold to unknown destinations for delivery after the start of the
2013 harvest on Sept. 1.  Exporters are required to report sales of 100,000 tons or
larger of a single commodity to one destination. Smaller sales
must be reported on a weekly basis, according to the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
