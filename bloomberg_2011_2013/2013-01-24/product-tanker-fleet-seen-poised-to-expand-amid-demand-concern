The supply of tankers that carry
refined oil products is set to expand at the same time that the
outlook for demand is sparking concern, said Henry Curra, head
of research for shipbroker  ACM Shipping Group Plc. (ACMG)   As many as 96 of the vessels were ordered last year and 12
so far this year in response to stronger ton-mile demand, gauged
by multiplying cargo size and distance traveled, according to
Curra. Following are comments he made today at Marine Money’s
 4th Annual London Ship Finance Forum .  Refined products such as gasoline are referred to in the
industry as clean, while dirty denotes crude oil.  “In 2010, we were very bullish on clean product carriers;
2011, we were quite bullish clean product carriers. Since 2012,
we are starting to get worried.  “The demand picture for Medium Range and Long Range
tankers is actually not that encouraging. In terms of import
volumes, they’re actually dipping. It’s only ton-mile demand
that’s saved those product carriers.  “There’s increasing ton miles out of the U.S. Gulf with
exports to  Europe  and to  Latin America , and Europe’s pulling in
more jet and gas oil from India and the  Middle East . So we still
have a positive story ton miles.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
