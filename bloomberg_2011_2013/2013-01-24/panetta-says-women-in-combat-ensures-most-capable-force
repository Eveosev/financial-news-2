Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  said
he is rescinding a rule that bans women serving in direct combat
roles to ensure that U.S. forces are the most capable they can
be.  “Women have shown great courage and sacrifice on and off
the battlefield, contributed in unprecedented ways to the
military’s mission and proven their ability to serve in an
expanding number of role,” Panetta said today in a statement.
“The department’s goal in rescinding the rule is to ensure that
the mission is met with the best-qualified and most capable
people, regardless of gender.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
