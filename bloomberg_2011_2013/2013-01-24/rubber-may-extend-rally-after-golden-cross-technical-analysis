Rubber may extend a rally to the
highest level since April after forming a so-called  golden-cross 
pattern this month, according to technical analysis by research
company JSC Corp. in Tokyo.  The 50-day moving average on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange
surpassed the 200-day average this month after climbing above
the 150-day average in November, signaling upward momentum is
accelerating, said analyst Takaki Shigemoto.  The contract may advance to the upper end of the so-called
Bollinger Band at about 322 yen a kilogram ($3,629 a metric ton)
in the short-term, with support seen around 286 yen, or the
lower end of the band, Shigemoto said.  “The market is expected to remain in an upward trend for
the coming months,” Shigemoto said yesterday.  Rubber for delivery in June settled at 308.3 yen in  Tokyo 
yesterday, rebounding 50 percent from a three-year low of 205.6
yen reached on Aug. 14. It is 42 percent below the record high
of 535.7 yen reached in February 2011, as growth in auto sales
decelerated in  China , the world’s largest consumer of the
commodity used to make tires.  Auto sales in China may gain 7 percent in 2013 to 20.65
million units, compared with last year’s 4.3 percent growth, the
state-backed China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said
Jan. 11. The pace of growth remains less than a quarter of the
stimulus-led 32 percent rate in 2010, as cities including
Beijing and Guangzhou restrict new vehicles to reduce smog and
traffic jams.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
