Twitter Inc., the social-networking
company that features 140-character status updates, released a
mobile app that lets users record, edit, and share six-second
video clips using  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPhones and iPod Touch devices.  The program, called Vine, became freely available in
Apple’s App Store and will work with other types of mobile
phones in the future, the San Francisco-based company said today
on its  blog .  Twitter is adding tools to help it win users and
advertising dollars from social-networking rival  Facebook Inc. (FB) 
The new video service follows the addition last month of color
filtering for photos uploaded to the company’s mobile app, a
move that may help it compete with Facebook’s Instagram service.  Vine was created by a startup which Twitter acquired, Dom
Hofmann, co-founder of Vine said on his company’s  blog  today.  “Our companies share similar values and goals; like
Twitter, we want to make it easier for people to come together
to share and discover what’s happening in the world,” Hofmann
said. “We also believe constraint inspires creativity, whether
it’s through a 140-character Tweet or a six-second video.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
