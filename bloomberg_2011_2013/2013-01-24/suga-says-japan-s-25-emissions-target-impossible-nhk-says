Japan’s chief cabinet secretary,
Yoshihide Suga, said the country’s target to cut greenhouse gas
emissions 25 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels is impossible to
achieve, public broadcaster NHK reported today.  The target is incredible and impossible to reach, Suga said
during a news conference, according to NHK. Japan will review
the emissions target, Suga added.  The goal was set by the previous administration before the
 Liberal Democratic Party  took power from the Democratic Party of
Japan in December’s election.  Japan needs to set a new emissions target before UN climate
talks scheduled to take place in November,  Nobuteru Ishihara ,
the new minister of the environment, said in a group media
interview on Dec. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
