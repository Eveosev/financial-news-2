Old Republic International Corp. (ORI) ,
the insurer that stopped selling coverage backing home loans,
fell the most since October after posting a fourth-quarter loss
on an increase in claims costs.  The insurer dropped 4.8 percent to $11.10 at 2:20 p.m. in
New York, the  second-biggest decline  in the 83-company Standard
and Poor’s Midcap Financials Index.  The net loss was $20.2 million, and compares with a profit
of $55.2 million a year earlier, the Chicago-based insurer said
in a statement today. The company spent 99.7 cents of every
premium dollar on claims and expenses, up from 91.7 a year
earlier, at its main businesses.  “Higher loss costs for the aggregated commercial
automobile, general liability, and workers’ compensation
coverages were most responsible for this uptrend,” the company
said in the statement.  “Workers’ compensation produced the
greatest adverse impact.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
