Taiwan  dollar forwards dropped the
most in a week on speculation policy makers will curb currency
gains to support exporters.  Taiwan Premier Sean Chen asked the central bank to closely
monitor the effects of the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s monetary easing aimed
at weakening the yen, the Cabinet said in a statement yesterday.
Taiwan and  South Korea  compete with  Japan  in the world market
for electronic products.  “The Korean won is also looking at the Japanese yen,”
said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader at
 Union Bank of Taiwan. (2838)  “If there are big moves in the Korean
won, the Taiwan central bank may take some action but the action
will be gradual.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.2 percent  to
NT$29 versus the greenback as of 10:03 a.m. in Taipei, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg, narrowing its premium to the spot
rate to 0.1 percent from 0.5 percent yesterday. The contracts
have fallen 0.3 percent this month.  Taiwan’s monetary authority has sold its currency to
counter gains on most days in the past nine months, according to
traders, who asked not to be identified. The central bank has
been signaling to the market that it wants the currency to
remain weaker than NT$29 per dollar, Tong said.  Taiwan’s dollar climbed 0.3 percent to NT$29.018 against
its U.S. counterpart, based on prices from Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency erased a gain of as much as 0.4 percent in the final
minute of trading yesterday.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, held at 2.8 percent.
It reached 2.6 percent on Jan. 22, the lowest level since
September 2007.  Export orders, an indicator of shipments in the next one to
three months, increased 8.5 percent in December from a year
earlier, government figures showed on Jan. 21.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.125 percent government bonds due
September 2022 was unchanged at 1.163 percent, according to
Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
