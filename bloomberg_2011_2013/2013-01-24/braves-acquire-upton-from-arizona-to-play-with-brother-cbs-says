The  Atlanta Braves  acquired All-Star
outfielder Justin Upton in a seven-player trade with the  Arizona
Diamondbacks , teaming him with older brother B.J., who joined
the club as a free agent two months ago.  The Braves also receive third baseman  Chris Johnson  from
the Diamondbacks for infielder/outfielder Martin Prado, pitcher
Randall Delgado and three minor leaguers -- pitcher Zeke Spruill
and infielders Brandon Drury and Nick Ahmed.  Both teams announced the deal in separate statements.  Upton, 25, was the first pick in  Major League Baseball ’s
2005 draft and spent his first six seasons with the
Diamondbacks. He hit .280 with 17 home runs, 67 runs batted in
and 18 stolen bases last season. He finished fourth in the
National League Most Valuable Player voting the previous year,
when he hit .289 with 31 homers, 88 RBI and 21 steals in helping
Arizona win the NL West division title.  In Atlanta, he’ll play the outfield alongside Jason Heyward
and his 28-year-old brother, who signed a five-year contract in
February that the Atlanta Journal Constitution said is worth
$75.25 million.  The Uptons are the latest brothers to become major-league
teammates, joining a group of almost 100 that includes Hank and
Tommie Aaron; Felipe, Jesus and Matty Alou; Adam and Andy LaRoche; Joe and Phil Niekro; Cal and Billy Ripken; Bengie and
Jose Molina; and Jeff and Jered Weaver.  Johnson, 28, had a .281 batting average with 15 home runs
and 76 RBI in 136 games with Houston and  Arizona  last season.  Prado, 29, heads to the Diamondbacks after hitting .301
with 42 doubles, 10 home runs and 70 RBI in 156 games with the
Braves in 2012. He led the National League with 60 multi-hit
games, ranking fourth in hits and fifth in doubles, while
playing five positions, including all four in the infield.  Delgado, 22, was rated by  Baseball America  as the Braves
third-ranked prospect in both 2011 and 2012. He had a 4-9 record
with a 4.37 earned run average in 18 games, including 17 starts,
for Atlanta last season.  Spruill, 23, pitched at the Double-A level with the Braves’
organization last season and went 9-11 with a 3.67 ERA.  Ahmed, a 22-year-old shortstop, and Drury, 20, both played
at the Class-A level last season. Ahmed hit .269 with six home
runs, 49 RBI and 40 stolen bases in 130 games, while Drury
batted .229 with six home runs and 51 RBI in 123 games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
