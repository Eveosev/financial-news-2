Mostostal Warszawa SA (MSW) , a unit of
 Spain ’s  Acciona SA (ANA) , and  Rafako SA (RFK) , Poland’s largest power
engineering company, won a 4.4 billion zloty ($1.4 billion)
contract from power producer  Tauron Polska Energia SA. (TPE)   Poland’s second-largest utility, which rejected bids from
China National Electric Engineering Co. Ltd.,  Alstom SA (ALO)  and SNC-
Lavalin Group Inc., will sign a deal with the Rafako-led group
to build a 910-megawatt, coal-fired plant in Jaworzno in the
second quarter, it said in a regulatory statement today.  Mostostal jumped 6.2 percent to 14.84 zloty at 12:02 p.m.,
heading for the highest close since April 2012. Rafako, a unit
of bankrupt Polish builder  PBG SA (PBG) , gained 4.6 percent to 9.4
zloty, while Tauron shares declined 1.4 percent to 4.83 zloty.  State-controlled Tauron picked the builder of its biggest
investment project almost two years later than planned. The
Katowice, Poland-based company, which is reviewing its expansion
plans, will spend as much as 45 billion zloty by 2020 to build
cleaner power plants and distribution lines.  In the last 12 months Polish utilities chose builders for
five new power plants that will add about 4,700 megawatts to the
country’s existing capacity of 37,700 megawatts. That’s 21.6
billion zloty of investment that will help builders offset a
drop in revenue as the government cuts road investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
