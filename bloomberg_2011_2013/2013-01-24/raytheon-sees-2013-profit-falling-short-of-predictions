  Raytheon Co. (RTN) , the world’s largest
missile maker, forecast 2013 profit will fall short of analysts’
estimates after fourth-quarter earnings declined from a year
earlier.  Profit from continuing operations for 2013 will be $5.16 to
$5.31 a share, the company said today in a statement. The
average of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit of
$5.46 a share on sales of $24.1 billion.  Raytheon followed  General Dynamics Corp. (GD)  by a day in
offering a 2013 forecast that was worse than analysts had
predicted. U.S. defense contractors face an uncertain future,
with Pentagon spending under pressure because of efforts to
reduce the federal deficit.  For the fourth quarter, Raytheon’s profit from continuing
operations was $466 million or $1.41 a share, compared with $539
million or $1.56 a share a year earlier, the Waltham,
Massachusetts-based company said in the statement. The average
of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a profit of $1.31
a share. Sales increased less than 1 percent to $6.44 billion.  Raytheon’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Swanson said in the statement that the company’s diversity of
programs and international sales “should help to mitigate some
of the potential overall impact” of defense cuts.  Raytheon fell 2 percent to $57.06 at 10:06 a.m. in  New York 
trading after gaining 17 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
