Areva SA (AREVA) ’s application to halt a  CEZ
AS (CEZ)  tender to supply two reactors to the Temelin nuclear power
station was rejected by Czech antitrust regulators.  CEZ won’t be allowed to sign a contract with the winner of
the tender until the watchdog publishes a final ruling on the
issue, Martin Svanda, a spokesman for the regulator, said today.  Areva sought to block the tender after CEZ excluded the
Paris-based company’s bid in October saying it didn’t meet legal
and commercial conditions. CEZ aims to pick bids by Westinghouse
Electric Corp. or a Russian-Czech group led by Rosatom Corp. by
the end of the summer and sign a contract by the year-end.  “It came as a bit of a surprise that the office again
rejected Areva’s request,” the French utility said in a
statement. “Areva is now considering further steps.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
