Latvia’s central bank, which pegs
its currency to the euro, left its benchmark interest rate
unchanged for a second meeting.  Latvijas Banka  kept the refinancing rate at 2.5 percent,
Governor Ilmars Rimsevics told a news conference today in the
capital, Riga.  The Baltic nation is rebounding from the world’s deepest
recession in 2008-2009, when economic output shrank by almost a
quarter after a property bubble burst and credit inflows dried
up, prompting an  International Monetary Fund  bailout. The
economy grew about 5 percent in 2012, Finance Minister Andris
Vilks said last month.  The refinancing rate affects the minimum interest rate on
about 75 million lati ($143 million) a week of central bank
swaps and repurchase agreements. The bank runs a quasi-currency-
board system, pegged to the euro, where lati in circulation are
backed by foreign currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
