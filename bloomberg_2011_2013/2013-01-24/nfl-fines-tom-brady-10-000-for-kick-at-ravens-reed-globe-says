New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was fined $10,000 by the National Football League for
unnecessary roughness against Ed Reed of the Baltimore Ravens,
the Boston Globe reported, citing a person familiar with the
discipline.  During the American Football Conference championship game
on Jan. 20, Brady ended a run with a slide and his raised leg
caught Baltimore safety Reed on the thigh.  Brady apologized to Reed, who said the quarterback was
trying to protect himself, according to the Globe.  The Ravens won 28-13 to advance to the Feb. 3 Super Bowl
against the San Francisco 49ers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
