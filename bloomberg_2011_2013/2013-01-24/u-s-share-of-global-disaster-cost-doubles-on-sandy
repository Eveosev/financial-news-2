The U.S. share of insurance losses
from worldwide catastrophes more than doubled in 2012 as
superstorm Sandy lashed the Northeast and the nation suffered
its worst drought since the 1930s.  The U.S. accounted for about 90 percent, or $65 billion, of
$72 billion in global losses, according to the Impact
Forecasting unit of  Aon Plc (AON) , the London-based insurance broker.
That compares with 40 percent in 2011 when  Japan  had higher-
than-usual costs because of an earthquake and tsunami.  The location and climate of the U.S. make the country more
vulnerable than most developed nations to hurricanes, tornadoes,
wildfires and drought. U.S. commercial buildings and homes are
more likely to have coverage than property in less wealthy
nations facing storm risk, like Nicaragua and Haiti.  “The  United States  has typically been the main driver of
global loss,” Steve Bowen, senior scientist and meteorologist
at Impact Forecasting, said in a phone interview today after his
firm released a statement on 2012 losses. The U.S. typically
accounts for about 64 percent of global insured losses, he said
in an e-mail.  The last time the U.S. incurred more than 90 percent of
losses was 2005 when the country was pummeled by hurricanes
including Katrina, Rita and Wilma, he said.  Sandy cost insurers about $28.2 billion, compared with
$78.2 billion for Katrina when adjusted to 2012 dollars, Impact
said. Crop insurance claims climbed to a record, with farmers
collecting more than $11.5 billion for damage in 2012, according
to a Risk Management Agency  report  published on the U.S.
Department of Agriculture website.  Travelers Cos., the lone insurer in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average , said this week that fourth-quarter  profit
fell  51 percent on claims from Sandy.  The KBW Insurance Index of 24 U.S.-listed companies gained
16 percent in the past 12 months, compared with the 20 percent
rally in the 75-company  Bloomberg World Insurance Index. (BWINSU)   To contact the reporter on this story:
