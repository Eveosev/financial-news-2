Brazil ’s central bank is making
headway toward its goal of reducing the use of short-term
maturities for  repurchase agreements , transactions used to take
liquidity out of the financial markets, a government official
with direct knowledge of the matter said.  Six-month repurchase agreements, known as repos, increased
to 267 billion reais ($131 billion) from 163 billion reais in
November, while overnight repos fell to about 70 billion reais
from 130 billion reais, according to the official, who asked not
to be identified because the numbers aren’t public yet.  The Brazilian monetary authority uses repos to pull short-
term funds from the financial system and maintain the  Selic rate 
around its 7.25 percent target. Switching to longer-term
maturities lowers risks to the government by reducing the
frequency the central bank must roll over debt.  Three-month repos rose to 70 billion reais from 7 billion
reais in the period, the official said, adding that the central
bank has a total of 600 billion reais of repo transactions
outstanding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
