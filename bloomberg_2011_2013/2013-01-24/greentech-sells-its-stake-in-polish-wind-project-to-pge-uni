Greentech Energy Systems A/S, a
Danish renewable-energy developer, sold its 50 percent share in
a Polish wind project to a unit of  PGE SA (PGE)  for 3.67 million euros
($4.91 million).  Greentech, based in Copenhagen, will continue investing in
 Poland  where it has 260 megawatts of power plants under
development, Chairman Peter Hostgaard-Jensen said in an e-mailed
statement today.  It decided to sell because its 50 percent stake in the 28-
megawatt Wojciechowo venture under development “would not have
given us the opportunity to consolidate and to run the
project,” he said.  PGE Energia Odnawialna now owns all of the 14-turbine
plant. The deal price includes 3.05 million euros for the
project’s shares and about 615,000 euros to repay a shareholder
loan, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
