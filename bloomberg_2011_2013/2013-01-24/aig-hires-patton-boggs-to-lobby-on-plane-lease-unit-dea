American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the insurer that repaid a U.S. bailout last year, hired Patton
Boggs LLP to  lobby lawmakers  over a deal to sell its aircraft-
leasing unit.  The firm  registered  to represent AIG effective Dec. 7, the
day the insurer said it was in talks to sell International Lease
Finance Corp. to a group of Chinese investors. The $4.2 billion
deal requires approval from regulators in China and the U.S.  AIG suspended all lobbying in October 2008, a month after
the U.S. provided the first part of a $182.3 billion rescue. The
U.S. on  Dec. 11  sold the last shares it had acquired in the
bailout of the New York-based insurer.  Patton Boggs handles regulatory and legal matters related
to international business deals, according to the Washington-
based firm’s website. CNBC reported earlier today that AIG hired
the firm.  “AIG has provided information about the company to
government officials on an ongoing basis, said Jim Ankner, a
spokesman for the insurer. “The reported activity is an
extension of those efforts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
