Repsol SA (REP) , the Spanish oil producer
stripped of its Argentine unit last year, said the South
American government is refusing to discuss compensation for the
nationalization of  YPF SA. (YPFD)   “We are not engaged in any negotiation with the Argentine
government,” Arturo Gonzalo, Repsol’s director of institutional
relations and corporate responsibility, said today at an event
in New York. “They don’t talk and they don’t pay.”  Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister Jose Manuel Garcia Margallo said Nov. 13 that there is space to negotiate terms for
Repsol departure from Argentina. The Madrid-based producer filed
a claim against Argentina with the International Center for
Settlement of Investment Disputes, a Washington-based
organization belonging to the World Bank, according to a Dec. 3
regulatory filing. Repsol said at the time it made the
arbitration claim after having completed a six-month period
since it notified Argentina of the disagreement.  Jessica Rey, a spokeswoman for Argentine Deputy Economy
Minister Axel Kicillof, and Horacio Mizrahi, a spokesman for
Planning Minister Julio De Vido, didn’t reply to telephone calls
seeking comment on Gonzalo’s statements today.  President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  said April 18 that
compensation will be determined by Argentina’s National
Appraisal Tribunal, a government-chartered agency that helps
determine the value of disputed assets involving companies or
governments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
