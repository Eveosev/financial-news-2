A 27 percent rally in  Sony Corp. (6758) 
convertible bonds since their debut 10 weeks ago is whetting the
appetite of investors for Japanese equity-linked debt sales,
which slumped to a seven-year low last year.  Sony’s 150 billion yen ($1.7 billion) of zero coupon notes
rose to 128.8 yen yesterday, from 101.6 yen when they were sold
on Nov. 14, Nomura Holdings Inc.’s prices show. That’s triple
the 8.7 percent gain for Japanese convertibles in the period and
compares with a 6.5 percent increase for similar securities
worldwide, according to UBS AG indexes. Sales of the bonds in
the country fell 15 percent to 280 billion yen last year, the
lowest since 2005, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The  Topix (TPX)  stock index climbed for 10 straight weeks, the
longest advance since 1986, after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
called for unlimited monetary easing to end deflation. The rally
bolstered Sony convertibles, even as the yield premium on its
non-exchangeable bonds rose 16 basis points in the period. As
much as $14 billion of convertible debt will be redeemed in
 Japan  this year, opening the room for more issuance, according
to Barclays Plc, the world’s fourth-largest underwriter of
equity-link notes this year.  “Consumer electronics companies can receive a strong
reception in the convertible  bond market , as illustrated by
Sony,” Nick Smith, Hong Kong-based head of convertible bond
origination in the Asia-Pacific region for Barclays, said in a
telephone interview Jan. 18. “We expect there to be more
offerings in the market this year because the share rally makes
issuers more comfortable selling convertibles.”  Stock Rally  The Topix index has surged 24 percent to 897.62 since Nov.
14, a day before Abe called on the BOJ to provide unlimited
cash.  Sony stock  climbed 37 percent to 1,189 yen in the period.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its six-month target for
the benchmark to 1,000 from its earlier assessment of 950 and
the 12-month outlook to 1,100 from 1,000, according to a note to
clients released yesterday.  Sony’s five-year zero-coupon bonds offered on Nov. 14 may
be converted into Sony stock at 957 yen per a share, 10 percent
above its closing price on the day. The notes rose 1.4 percent
to 130.6 yen per a 100 yen face value as of 3:38 p.m. today,
outperforming the Topix index and reversing two days of
declines, according to Nomura prices.  ABC-Mart Inc., a Tokyo-based shoe retailer, offered last
week 33 billion yen of zero-coupon convertible bonds due 2018,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The  shares  was unchanged at
3,405 yen today, versus the 4,588 yen conversion price, the data
show.  Perception Shift  “Sony’s success is helping change investors’ perception of
convertible bonds,” Noriyuki Murakami, who oversees 4.8 billion
yen of convertible debt including Sony notes at Sumitomo Mitsui
Trust Asset Management Co., said in a telephone interview from
 Tokyo  yesterday. “Improving market conditions indicate that
there will probably be more companies like Sony and ABC-Mart
choosing convertibles for financing.”  George Boyd , a Tokyo-based spokesman for Sony, declined to
comment, citing company policy not to comment on market moves.  Elsewhere in Japan’s credit markets,  South Korea ’s KT Corp.
raised 30 billion yen in Samurai bonds, this year’s first sale
of the notes by an overseas issuer in Japan, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The telecommunications company offered 5
billion yen of 0.59 percent two-year debt, 18.2 billion yen of
0.7 percent three-year securities and 6.8 billion yen of 0.86
percent five-year bonds, the data show.  Japan’s corporate bonds have handed investors a 0.24
percent return this year, compared with a 0.18 percent gain for
Samurai bonds and 0.4 percent advance in sovereign notes,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Company
debt worldwide was little changed in the period.  Sovereign Yield  Yields on Japan’s benchmark 10-year government bonds was
little changed at 0.73 percent as of 3:43 p.m. in Tokyo today.
The securities yielded 109 basis points less than similar-
maturity U.S. Treasuries, compared with 106 a year earlier.  The yen weakened 0.73 percent to 89.34 per dollar as of
4:17 p.m. in Tokyo today. It lost 12 percent in the past three
months, the most among the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  The yen’s weakening was spurred by Abe, Japan’s seventh
prime minister since 2007, who urged the central bank to double
its inflation target to help revive the world’s third-biggest
economy. The  Bank of Japan  heeded that call, saying on Jan. 22
after a policy meeting that it will raise the price-increase
goal to 2 percent and move to open-ended asset purchases
starting in January 2014 to meet the target.  ‘Positive Implications’  “The change in political leadership is a major contributor
to the improving prospects for convertibles,” Murakami said.
“The markets have yet to fully reflect the positive
implications.”  Sales of convertible notes by Japanese companies slumped
for the second straight year in 2012, declining 15 percent to
280 billion yen after a 16 percent drop in the preceding period,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sony’s notes accounted
for more than half of the offerings last year.  This year’s redemptions include 33.2 billion yen of
Softbank Corp.’s 1.5 percent notes due in March and 200 billion
yen of Sharp Corp.’s zero-coupon bonds in September. Softbank’s
securities traded at 135.8 yen per a 100 yen face value as of
3:46 p.m. today, according to Nomura prices, while Sharp notes
rose to 85.75 yen from a record low 43.1 yen on Oct. 18, Tokyo
Stock Exchange prices show.  Sony posted in November a  net loss  of 15.5 billion yen for
the three months ended Sept. 30, its seventh straight quarterly
loss. The Tokyo-based company, which has 256 billion yen of  debt 
maturing by December, kept its forecasts to report the first
annual profit in five years.  “Investors have done very well in deals such as Sony’s,”
Barclays’ Smith said. “Getting rewarded like that for taking
risk only whets their appetite for more of such deals.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
