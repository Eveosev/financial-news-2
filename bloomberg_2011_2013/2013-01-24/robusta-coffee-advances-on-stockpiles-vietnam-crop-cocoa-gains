Robusta coffee gained for a second
day in  London  on speculation stockpiles will continue to fall
just as production in  Vietnam , the world’s largest producer of
the variety, may be smaller than anticipated. Cocoa rose.  Vietnam will produce 1.393 million metric tons of coffee in
the 2012-13 season that started Oct. 1, according to Amsterdam-
based trader Nedcoffee BV. That’s down from a previous estimate
of 1.48 million tons and from 1.62 million tons a year earlier,
the trader, which also has offices in  Ho Chi Minh City , Vietnam,
said in a report on Jan. 16. Robusta coffee stockpiles have
fallen 75 percent since reaching an all-time high in July 2011.  “Robusta certified stocks will continue to decrease,”
Thijs Pons, an ABN Amro Bank NV analyst, said in a report e-
mailed today. “The global consumption balance between arabica
and robusta has seen a shift towards the cheaper robusta.”  Robusta coffee for March delivery was up 0.5 percent to
$1,971 a ton by 10:23 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. The price
touched $1,985 a ton, the highest since Jan. 18, in earlier
trade. Arabica coffee for March delivery was 0.3 percent higher
at $1.508 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  Robusta coffee stockpiles with a valid grading certificate
in warehouses monitored by NYSE Liffe were 104,860 metric tons
on Jan. 7, down 1.6 percent from two weeks earlier. The exchange
will update inventory figures later today. Stockpiles were at an
all-time high of 417,420 a ton in July 2011.  Cocoa for March delivery was up 0.1 percent at 1,449 pounds
($2,294) a ton on NYSE Liffe. Cocoa for March delivery gained
0.2 percent to $2,220 a ton on ICE.  White, or refined, sugar for March delivery fell 0.8
percent to $485.90 a ton in London. Raw sugar for March delivery
was 0.2 percent down at 18.46 cents a pound in New York, after
rising to as much as 18.60 cents a pound yesterday.  Sugar price strength yesterday may have been due to the
potential for more cane to be allocated to ethanol production
next season in  Brazil , the world’s largest producer, Deutsche
Bank AG said in an e-mailed report. An increase in arrears by
millers in  India  and reduced output in  Thailand  may also have
helped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
