The House Ways and Means Committee
will release a draft version of potential changes to the
taxation of financial products and derivatives, according to a
committee aide familiar with the plans.  The draft could be released for review and discussion as
soon as this week, said the aide, who asked not to be named in
order to discuss the matter.  The proposals are part of Committee Chairman  Dave Camp ’s
efforts to overhaul the  tax code . The Michigan Republican
released a similar draft of international tax changes in 2011,
and has said he plans to push a revision of the individual and
corporate tax systems through his panel this year.  Camp held a hearing on the taxation of financial products
in December 2011, in conjunction with the Senate Finance
Committee.  “Today’s marketplace features a wide array of products
that can result in different tax or financial accounting
treatment of economically similar products, including debt,
equity -- and mixtures of the two -- and financial derivatives,
such as options, futures, and forward contracts and swaps,”
Camp said in his opening statement at that hearing.  One of the options explored then was marking financial
products to market for tax purposes. In other words, taxpayers
could be charged on gains in the value of a financial instrument
from year to year, even if they haven’t sold or exchanged it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
