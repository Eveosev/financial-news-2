Ethanol production in the U.S. rose
1 percent to 792,000 barrels a day last week, the Energy
Information Administration said.  Output rebounded in the period ended Jan. 18 from the
lowest level since the Energy Departmentâ€™s statistical agency
began tracking weekly data in June 2010. Stockpiles declined 1.4
percent to 20 million barrels, falling from the highest amount
in four weeks.  Imports of the biofuel jumped to 67,000 barrels a day from
27,000 the previous week, the EIA said today. Ethanol-blended
gasoline made up about 88 percent of the total U.S. gasoline
pool, compared with 90 percent in the week ended Jan. 11.  Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 0.1 cent to
$2.375 a gallon at 10:21 a.m. local time on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices have gained 9.2 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
