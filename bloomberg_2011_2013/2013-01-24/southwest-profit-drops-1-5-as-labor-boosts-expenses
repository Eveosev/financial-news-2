Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) , the biggest
low-fare carrier, said fourth-quarter profit fell 1.5 percent
amid higher labor costs.  Profit excluding some items was $65 million, or 9 cents a
share, from $66 million, also 9 cents, on that basis a year
earlier, the Dallas-based carrier said today in a statement.
That exceeded the 8-cent average of 16 analysts’  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Southwest is contending with rising labor and jet fuel
costs amid growing competition from larger carriers. The airline
is adding or increasing fees to help boost annual revenue by
about $100 million, in a departure from its stance of forgoing
some charges that are standard for the industry.  “These solid earnings were achieved despite significant
efforts and costs related to critical strategic initiatives,”
Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said in the statement.  Labor costs rose 4.5 percent to $1.2 billion in the
quarter, while fuel and oil advanced 0.7 percent to $1.51
billion.  Sales rose 1.6 percent in the quarter to $4.17 billion,
less than the $4.2 billion average of 12 estimates. Traffic,
measured in miles flown by paying passengers, fell 1.4 percent
as overall expenses rose 3.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
