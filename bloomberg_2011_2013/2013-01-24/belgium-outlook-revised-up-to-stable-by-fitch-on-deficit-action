Belgium  had the outlook on its AA
credit rating raised by  Fitch Ratings , which cited deficit
reductions and a decrease in borrowing costs amid contained
risks from bank rescues and the euro-area debt crisis.  Fitch affirmed Belgium’s AA rating and revised the outlook
on the nation’s debt to stable from negative, according to a
statement yesterday. Belgium’s budget deficit probably narrowed
to 2.9 percent of gross domestic product last year and its
public debt may have  peaked  at close to 100 percent of GDP,
Fitch said.  “Public debt, Belgium’s main rating weakness, has peaked
in 2012/2013, earlier and only moderately higher than in France
and the U.K.,” Fitch analysts Michele Napolitano and Douglas Renwick, who are based in  London , said in the statement. “Debt
dynamics are relatively robust to stylized shocks, mainly owing
to a primary surplus in 2012.”  Investors have rewarded Belgium for sticking to its deficit
targets since it took the country a record 541 days to form a
government after the June 2010 elections. It sold 10-year bonds
at a record-low yield of 2.252 percent in the most recent
auction on Nov. 26. The 10-year yield fell 3 basis points to
2.34 percent at 9:12 a.m. in Brussels, compared with last year’s
high of 4.66 percent on Jan. 6, 2012.  As measured by credit-default swap prices compiled by
Bloomberg, Belgium’s debt is now a better credit than  France ,
rated two steps higher at AAA by Fitch. Investors often ignore
ratings, evidenced by the rally in Treasuries after the U.S.
lost its top grade at S&P in 2011.  Sovereign Yields  Yields on sovereign securities moved in the opposite
direction from what ratings suggested in 53 percent of 32
upgrades, downgrades and changes in credit outlook last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg published on Dec. 17.
Investors ignored 56 percent of Moody’s Investors Service rating
and outlook changes and 50 percent of those by S&P. That’s worse
than the longer-term average of 47 percent, based on more than
300 changes since 1974.  A deterioration of the credit quality of  Dexia SA (DEXB) ’s
residual assets, a prolonged political standstill following the
2014 elections and a further loss of competitiveness are the
main risks to Belgium’s rating, Fitch said.  Recent government steps to rein in private-sector salary
increases and at the same time preserve an automatic link
between wages and inflation “do not address the competitiveness
gap,” Fitch said.  The rating company’s 2012 deficit estimate assumes that the
nation’s 2.92 billion-euro ($3.89 billion) purchase of preferred
shares in Belgian bank Dexia will be treated as a financial
transaction and can thus be excluded from the budget figures. A
final ruling by Eurostat, the European Union statistics office,
will be made in April, Fitch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
