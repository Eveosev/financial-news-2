Banco Sabadell (SAN)  SA,  Spain ’s fifth-
biggest bank, posted a fourth-quarter loss after booking costs
to cover losses on real estate.  The net  loss  of 8.73 million euros ($11.6 million) compared
with profit of 24.5 million euros a year earlier, the Sabadell,
Spain-based lender said in a filing to regulators today. The
average estimate of seven analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg was for
a loss of 14.54 million euros.  Spanish lenders, including Sabadell, have been booking
costs to comply with government orders to recognize losses on
real estate that piled up on their balance sheets as Spain’s
property boom turned to bust. Sabadell, which boosted its  assets 
by more than 60 percent last year with the acquisition of the
failed savings bank  Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo (CAM) , said it
increased real estate sales by 1.6 times last year to 2.23
billion euros as it offloaded 13,777 properties.  Net interest income jumped 27 percent in the quarter to
487.3 million euros from a year earlier.  Bad loans as a proportion of total lending rose to 9.33
percent from 8.46 percent in September. Costs for provisioning
impaired assets climbed to 370.2 million euros in the fourth
quarter from 281.6 million euros a year ago.  Sabadell shares have risen 8.6 percent this year, valuing
the bank at 6.35 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
