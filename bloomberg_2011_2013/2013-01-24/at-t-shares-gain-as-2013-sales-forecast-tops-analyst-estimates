AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. phone
company, posted a narrower fourth-quarter loss after customers
bought a record number of discounted smartphones, including 8.6
million of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhones.  The loss shrank to $3.86 billion, or 68 cents a share, from
$6.68 billion, or $1.12, a year earlier, Dallas-based AT&T said
yesterday. Leaving out charges such as pension costs, profit was
44 cents a share, missing the 45-cent average of analysts,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales were little
changed at $32.6 billion, topping the estimate of $32.2 billion.  AT&T recruited 780,000 contract  customers , surpassing the
683,000 average of nine estimates compiled by Bloomberg, by
offering smartphone prices that squeezed profits. Chief
Executive Officer  Randall Stephenson  is working to catch up to
the subscriber growth of  Verizon Wireless , which added 2.1
million contract customers last quarter.  “The fourth quarter is always a tough one,”  Todd Rethemeier , an analyst with Hudson Square Research in  New York ,
said in an interview. “The new iPhone puts margins at a low
point for the year.”  AT&T forecast sales this year of at least $130 billion,
compared with the $128 billion estimate of analysts. Earnings
per share will expand by a percentage in the “upper single
digits or higher,” the company said. Analysts estimate a 9
percent increase.  AT&T rose 0.8 percent to $34.02 at the close in New York.
The stock climbed 11 percent last year, behind the 13 percent
gain of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Heavy Discount  Like Verizon, AT&T sells smartphones such as Apple’s iPhone
5, which was introduced in September, at a loss to persuade
customers to sign two-year subscriptions. A new AT&T user can
buy the  iPhone 5  for $649 with no contract or for $199 by
committing to a long-term deal, for example. While those
discounts hurt profit margins initially, they produce a steady
stream of revenue over the life of the agreement.  AT&T had already announced last week in a filing that
smartphone sales hit 10.2 million in the quarter, warning that
hitting that record would hurt profits.  The carrier also said then that it had lowered its expected
long-term rate of return for its  pension plan , leading to a $10
billion charge, and that repairs following superstorm Sandy
would cut $175 million from operating income. Last year’s
fourth-quarter results were hurt by a $4 billion pretax charge
for the failed  acquisition  of  T-Mobile USA .  Data Spending  The average monthly mobile-phone bill for users on
contracts increased 1.9 percent to $64.98 as smartphone owners
spent more to watch videos and listen to music. Leaving out the
effect of the Sandy storm, the bill increase would have been 2.1
percent, AT&T said. Analysts had estimated $65.32, according to
an average of nine estimates.  The profit margin for wireless service, leaving out items
such as interest and taxes, was 29.1 percent, little changed
from a year earlier. Without the effects of Sandy, it would have
been almost 30 percent, AT&T said. That compares with the 31.1
percent average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of nine analysts.  Stephenson may look beyond U.S. borders to reignite growth.
Calling international consolidation “inevitable,” he said on a
conference call yesterday that AT&T is considering partnerships
with foreign phone carriers. The Wall Street Journal reported
last week, citing unidentified people, that AT&T is looking at
takeover targets in  Europe .  Sales from AT&T’s landline business slid 0.5 percent to
$14.9 billion. AT&T added 192,000 U-verse television subscribers
to reach 4.5 million.  AT&T’s fourth-quarter capital spending was $5.9 billion, up
from $5.5 billion a year earlier. For the full year, the company
spent $19.7 billion, within the range of its original forecast
of $19 billion to $20 billion, and below the $20.3 billion spent
in 2011, including interest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
