Australian residential land sales
slumped in the third quarter, signaling a “rocky road” for a
recovery in home building, the  Housing Industry Association  said.  Land sales across the country dropped by 18 percent in the
three months to Sept. 30, after climbing for the prior three
quarters, according to the HIA-RP Data Residential Land Report.  The data “highlights the uncertainty around whether the
new home building sector can mount a recovery that is both
sustainable and of the magnitude  Australia ’s population and
economy require,”  Harley Dale , chief economist at the industry
group, said in an e-mailed statement.  Australia’s  building industry  has been contracting for 31
consecutive months and the number of construction jobs fell by
21,900 in the 12 months through November, even as the central
bank  cut   interest rates  by 1.75 percentage points since November
2011. Still, the pace of land sales is speeding up, climbing 15
percent from the record low of a year ago, the report showed.  The weighted median residential lot value across the
country rose by 3.8 percent to A$197,807 ($208,449) during the
quarter, according to the report. The median value rose 5.1
percent to A$225,795 in capital cities and 0.8 percent to
A$155,214 in regional areas over the three months, according to
the report.  “Low interest rates and a subtle improvement in  consumer
confidence , together with government incentives now more focused
on new housing, are likely to be the driver behind a gradually
improving market,” Tim Lawless, research director at Brisbane-
based RP Data, said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
