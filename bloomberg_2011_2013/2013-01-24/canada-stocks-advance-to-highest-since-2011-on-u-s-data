Canadian stocks advanced, led by
technology shares, as Research In Motion Ltd. surged after
 Lenovo Group Ltd. (992)  said it’s considering a deal with the
BlackBerry maker.  RIM jumped 3 percent as Lenovo assessed potential
acquisition targets and strategic alliances. Encana Corp. and
Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. rose at least 1.6 percent,
pacing gains in energy shares, as oil rallied from a one-week
low.  Agrium Inc. (AGU) , operator of the largest U.S. network of
agricultural retail outlets, added 2.8 percent after reporting
fourth-quarter profit that exceeded estimates.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index added 27.13
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,821.18 at 1:47 p.m. in Toronto.
Trading volume was 22 percent above the 30-day average. The S&P
500 briefly rose above 1,500 for the first time since 2007.  “There’s a lot of green so far,” said John Kinsey, who
helps manage about C$1 billion of assets at Caldwell Securities
Ltd. in Toronto. “People are feeling that 2013 might be a
little better year than 2012, and the markets are creeping up a
little bit every day.”  The S&P/TSX has risen 3.2 percent so far this year amid
optimism the global economy is recovering. Technology and
health-care companies have led the rally, increasing more than
9.8 percent. Consumer staples stocks have fallen 0.5 percent for
the biggest decline among  10 groups  in the measure.  Economic Data  American economic data also helped lift the market today.
Claims for jobless benefits in the world’s largest economy
unexpectedly dropped to a five-year low. The index of American
leading indicators rose in December by the most in three months.  “The U.S. coughs, we get pneumonia,” said Chyanne Fickes,
a fund manager at Toronto-based Stone Asset Management Ltd.,
which manages C$700 million. “Given the jobless claims being
better, that backs up better growth down the road for the United
States, which bodes well for  Canada .”  Technology and health-care shares had the biggest gains in
the S&P/TSX today among 10 groups, advancing at least 1.3
percent. Raw-material and utility companies fell.  RIM (RIM)  rallied 3 percent to C$17.81, poised for the highest
closing price since 2011. The shares have risen 51 percent so
far this year. RIM began a review of its strategic options last
year after losing market share to smartphones such as  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy, raising
speculation that it could be a takeover target.  Earlier today, RIM dropped as much as 5.4 percent after
rival Apple posted its slowest profit growth in a decade.  Energy Shares  Energy shares rose as oil climbed amid a narrowing spread
between West Texas Intermediate crude in the U.S. and  London ’s
Brent. Encana added 1.6 percent to C$19.65. Canadian Natural
Resources rose 1.9 percent to C$30.74.  Methanex Corp. (MEOH)  rallied 7.9 percent to C$34.80. The company
announced a 10-year natural gas supply agreement with Chesapeake
Energy Corp. Separately, the shares were raised to outperform
from market perform at Raymond James Financial Inc. by equity
analyst Steven Hansen.  Agrium advanced 2.8 percent to C$113.88. Fourth-quarter
profit excluding one-time items was “slightly above” $2 a
share, buoyed by demand for crop nutrients, Calgary-based Agrium
said today in a statement. Agrium was expected to earn  $1.71 a
share , the average of 22 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. In November the company, which also produces potash
and nitrogen-based fertilizer, forecast $1.50 to $1.90 a share.  The company plans to release its full fourth-quarter
results on Feb. 22, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
