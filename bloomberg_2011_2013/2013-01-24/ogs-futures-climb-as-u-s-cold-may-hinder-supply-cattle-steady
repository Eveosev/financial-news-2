Hog futures rallied to the highest
price since July on speculation that cold weather is disrupting
the movement of animals. Cattle were little changed.  Temperatures in parts of southern  Minnesota  reached minus
10 degrees to minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 23 to minus 26
Celsius) this week, and parts of Iowa were at zero to minus 5
degrees, Joel Widenor, a vice president for Commodity Weather
Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland , said in a telephone interview.  “Moving livestock is challenging” in frigid weather,
Lawrence Kane, a market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group, said
in a telephone interview from  Yates City ,  Illinois . “The
logistics just get that much tougher when it’s cold.”  Hog futures for April settlement rose 1.3 percent to 89.125
cents a pound at 9:53 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
heading for the biggest gain since Dec. 19. Earlier, the price
reached 89.5 cents, the highest for a most-active contract since
July 9.  Wholesale  pork  rose 0.3 percent to 85.08 cents a pound
yesterday, the highest since Dec. 6, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. Spot  hogs  rallied 0.9 percent to 84.68
cents a pound yesterday, the highest since Dec. 5, according to
the USDA.  Cattle futures for April delivery were down less than 0.1
percent at $1.30425 a pound in  Chicago . Prices through yesterday
had fallen 1.4 percent this month.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement rose 0.6 percent
to $1.47975 a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
