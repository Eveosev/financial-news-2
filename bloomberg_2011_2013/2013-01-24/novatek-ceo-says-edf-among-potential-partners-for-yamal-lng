OAO Novatek (NVTK)  is talking with
companies including  Electricite de France  SA about participating
in the Yamal LNG venture should Russia’s second-largest gas
producer decide to add a partner.  “If there are good partners with good markets, we are
ready to consider them, but 80 percent for Novatek in this
project is also very good,” Novatek Chief Executive Officer
Leonid Mikhelson said in an interview at the  World Economic
Forum  in Davos, Switzerland yesterday.  Novatek is developing a $20 billion project to liquefy
natural gas on the Yamal Peninsula in northern Russia together
with  Total SA (FP) , which holds a 20 percent stake. The Yamal LNG
venture is planned to start in 2016 and deliver gas to both
European and Asian clients Tarko Sale, Russia-based Novatek
expect to sign the first contracts with customers in the first
half of this year.  “We consider the project highly profitable,” Mikhelson
said.  EDF is in talks with Novatek about Yamal LNG, EDF CEO  Henri Proglio  told reporters in southern Russia on Dec. 7, without
elaborating. EDF’s press service didn’t immediately respond to a
request for comments today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
