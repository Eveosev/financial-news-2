Philippine seven-year bonds advanced,
driving the yield to a two-week low, on optimism the central
bank will keep its benchmark  interest rate  at a record low. The
peso was little changed.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will maintain its overnight
borrowing rate at 3.5 percent today, according to all 20
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Separately, they predict
the monetary authority will leave the rate on hold until the
third quarter before raising the measure by 25 basis points in
the last three months. Inflation averaged 3.2 percent in 2012,
compared with the central bank’s target of 3 percent to 5
percent, Governor Amando Tetangco said on Jan. 4.  “There seems no immediate risk of a rate increase given
tame inflation and the upward pressure on the peso,” said Dave Estacio, an assistant vice president at First Metro Investment
Corp. in  Manila .  The yield on the 3.875 percent bonds due November 2019 fell
nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 4.12 percent,
the lowest level since Jan. 10, according to midday fixing
prices at Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp.  The peso was at 40.630 per dollar at the noon trading break,
compared with 40.618 yesterday, prices from Tullett Prebon Plc
show. It climbed to 40.550 on Jan. 14, the strongest level since
March 2008. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, held at 4
percent.  Bangko Sentral, which cut rates four times last year, is
scheduled to announce its policy decision at 4 p.m. local time.  “Low interest rates are fuelling prices of financial
assets and pushing resources to non-tradable sectors, especially
real estate,” the  International Monetary Fund  said in a
statement yesterday after a Philippine review. The Washington-
based institute forecasts growth of 6 percent this year from an
estimated 6.5 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
