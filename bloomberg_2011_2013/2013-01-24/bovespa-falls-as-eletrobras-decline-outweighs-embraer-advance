The Bovespa index fell as  Centrais
Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6)  tumbled after  Brazil  reduced
electricity costs more than previously announced, overshadowing
a surge by planemaker  Embraer SA. (EMBR3)   Eletrobras, as the state-controlled utility is known,
slipped the most on the benchmark. Steelmaker  Usinas
Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA  tumbled to the lowest since
November. Embraer jumped after signing a $4 billion contract
with Republic Airways Holdings Inc.  The Bovespa fell 0.5 percent to 61,649.95 at 3:39 p.m. in
Sao Paulo after earlier rising as much as 0.5 percent. Forty-
five stocks dropped on the measure while 20 advanced. The real
strengthened 0.2 percent to 2.0312 per U.S. dollar.  Eletrobras fell 5.6 percent to 7.40 reais after President
Dilma Rousseff said yesterday that electricity rate cuts taking
effect today will pare consumers’ power costs 18 percent and
those for industry by 32 percent, compared with the reductions
of 16.2 percent and 28 percent she had announced in September.  “Power utilities have been suffering a lot because of
these measures, and today’s decline is a reaction to the latest
announcement,” Luis Gustavo Pereira, an analyst at Futura
Corretora in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone interview.  Usiminas, as Usinas Siderurgicas is also known, dropped 3.7
percent to 10.59 reais. Embraer rose 8.1 percent to 15.81 reais.  To contact the reporters on this story:
