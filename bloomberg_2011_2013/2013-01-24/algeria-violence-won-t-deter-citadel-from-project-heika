Citadel Capital SAE (CCAP) , Egypt’s biggest
publicly traded private-equity firm, won’t back out of a project
to build a cement plant in Algeria after foreign hostages were
killed at a gas plant, Chairman Ahmed Heikal said.  “On the contrary,” Heikal said, when asked about delaying
or canceling the project, in an interview in Davos, Switzerland,
where he was attending the World Economic Forum. “Once we get
the final approvals from the Algerian government, we will move
ahead.”  Companies are reviewing security measures and projects in
west and northern Africa after at least 38 foreign workers were
killed following their kidnap by Islamist militants.  BP Plc (BP/) ,
 Statoil ASA (STL)  and Algeria’s Sonatrach had employees working at the
plant.  Citadel’s unit plans to start building the plant with
 Algeria ’s government-owned Zahana Cement Co. by the end of the
year, Heikal said earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
