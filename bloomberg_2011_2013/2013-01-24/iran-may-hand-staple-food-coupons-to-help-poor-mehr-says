Iran ’s government may distribute
staple foods to 17 million of the country’s poorest people
before the Iranian year ends on March 20,  Mehr  reported, citing
an unidentified Commerce Ministry official.  Rice, sugar and cooking oil would be handed to those
identified as being in need, the official said, according to a
report today by the state-run news agency.  Iran’s inflation has quickened and the economy is under
strain amid tighter U.S. and European Union sanctions aimed at
curbing Iran’s nuclear program. December inflation accelerated
to 27.4 percent from 26.1 the previous month, according to the
Central Bank.  The parliament and Ahmadinejad government earlier agreed to
allocate about $2 billion from the National Development Fund,
where 20 percent of Iran oil revenue is directed, to support
low-income families, the Mehr report said.  Iran’s ministry of industries, mines and commerce was
previously in charge of handing staples coupons, though the
distribution was halted after the nation started in 2010 a
subsidy reform plan, according to a Mehr  report  yesterday.  Based on the plan, some Iranians have been receiving
monthly payments to make up for hikes in energy and food prices.
Distribution may now resume as the government and parliament
announced their intention to increase the purchasing power of
the poor in the remaining months of the year, Mehr said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
