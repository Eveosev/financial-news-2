India’s rupee rebounded, erasing the
day’s losses, after the nation boosted a limit on foreign
investments in local-currency debt.  The regulatory ceiling on holdings was increased by $10
billion to $75 billion, according to a statement on the central
bank’s website. The ownership cap for government notes was
raised by $5 billion to $25 billion and that for company notes
to $50 billion from $45 billion. The Reserve Bank of India will
cut interest rates next week for the first time since April to
help revive economic growth, a Bloomberg survey showed.  “Inflows will definitely increase,” said Ashtosh Raina,
head of foreign-exchange trading at  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB)  in Mumbai.
“This is a very good step ahead of the central bank’s policy
review, and should give it room to cut rates.”  The rupee was little changed at 53.6850 per dollar in
Mumbai, having dropped as much as 0.4 percent earlier, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility in
the rupee, a gauge of expected moves in the exchange rate used
to price options, fell 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point,
to 9.85 percent today, taking this week’s decline to 30 basis
points.  International  investments  in bonds rose 27 percent since
the end of 2011, touching a record $33.3 billion on Jan. 3,
exchange data show.  The yield on the 8.15 percent government bonds maturing in
June 2022 rose one basis point to 7.88 percent, according to the
central bank’s trading system. The notes pay 608 basis points
more than similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries. Local bond and
currency markets are shut tomorrow for a holiday.  Rate Outlook  The rupee declined earlier after the International Monetary
Fund predicted yesterday that the world economy will expand 3.5
percent this year, less than the 3.6 percent forecast in October.
The Washington-based lender scaled back its 2013 estimate for
 India  to 5.9 percent from 6 percent.  India’s Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram plans to
stick to a budget-deficit target of 4.8 percent of gross
domestic product in the year through March 2014, he said in an
interview on Jan. 22, adding that he’d like interest rates to
moderate to revive economic growth. The Reserve Bank of India
will lower its benchmark  repurchase rate  by 25 basis points to
7.75 percent at a Jan. 29 review, according to 22 of 26 analysts
in a Bloomberg survey. Two predict a cut to 7.5 percent and one
sees no change.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 54.75 per
dollar, compared with 54.64 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
unchanged at 54.46. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
