The Caspian Pipeline Consortium’s
crude link that runs from northwest  Kazakhstan  to the  Black Sea 
will reach full capacity by 2015, according to OAO Transneft.  The expansion is still dependent on whether fields being
developed have started production, Mikhail Barkov, a vice-
president at  Russia ’s state-owned pipeline operator, said today
in Moscow. The link’s output is to be increased to 67 million
metric tons annually, or 1.4 million barrels a day.  The CPC pipeline carries roughly half that volume of crude
from Kazakh fields including Chevron Corp.-led Tengiz to a
terminal close to the Russian port of Novorossiysk on the Black
Sea. The first phase of the expansion to add 10 million metric
tons, or about 210,000 barrels a day, will be finished this year
or by early 2014, Barkov said.  Chevron, the biggest corporate shareholder in the pipeline
with a 15 percent stake, is ready to fulfil the expanded first
phase, Barkov said.  BG Group Plc (BG/)  and  Eni SpA (ENI) , which operate the
Karachaganak field that feeds into CPC, are also shareholders
along with Exxon Mobil Corp., OAO Rosneft, OAO Lukoil and  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)   CPC Blend is a light, sweet or low-sulfur grade with a
density of 44.2 degrees on the American Petroleum Institute
scale and a sulfur content of 0.53 percent, according to
Chevron.  To contact the reporter on this story:
