JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s chief equity
strategist in Tokyo, Hajime Kitano, will resign the investment
bank, he wrote in an e-mail to clients today.  Kitano was ranked Japan’s No. 2 equity researcher for 2012
by Institutional Investor magazine, falling from the top spot he
held the previous year. JPMorgan spokeswoman Yukako Yoshino
declined to comment. Kitano was not immediately available when
called.  “Kitano had deep insights, and he was popular with his
analysis,” said Koji Toda, chief  fund manager  at Tokyo-based
Resona Bank Ltd., which oversees about $174 billion. “He was
helpful in analyzing past events for future investments. I’m
surprised to know he is leaving.”  Kitano, who topped Institutional Investor’s survey in 2011
and 2007, said in his e-mail that conveying information on the
financial markets is his calling, and he hopes to send out
reports again.  To contact the reporters on this story:
