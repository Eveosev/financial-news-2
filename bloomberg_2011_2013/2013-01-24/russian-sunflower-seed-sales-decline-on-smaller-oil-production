Sales of sunflower seeds in  Russia ,
the worldâ€™s second-biggest producer, dropped 42 percent compared
with a year earlier to 824,000 metric tons in December, SovEcon
said on its  website , citing state statistics data.  Russia harvested 7.96 million tons of sunflower seeds this
season, or about 18 percent less than the record crop a year
earlier, Agriculture Ministry data show. The country is the
second-biggest sunflower seed and sunflower oil producer after
Ukraine, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Non-
refined sunflower oil production dropped 23 percent in December
compared with a year earlier and declined 12 percent compared
with the preceding month, SovEcon, a Moscow-based industry
researcher, said.  Average sunflower seeds prices rose 0.3 percent to 17,250
rubles ($572) a ton in the European part of Russia last week,
according to SovEcon data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
