The  London  Olympic stadium will host
an athletics meet on the anniversary of the opening ceremony of
the 2012 Games.  The London Grand Prix, part of track and field’s elite
Diamond League series, will be held at the stadium in east
London on July 27, one year to the date of the Olympics’
opening.  “The atmosphere was electric during the Games,” Britain’s
Mo Farah, who won the men’s 5,000 and 10,000 gold medals in the
stadium, said in a statement from the London Legacy Development
Corp. “I’ll never forget it, so it’s great that British fans,
and athletes, will get to experience that again so soon after
the Games.”  The London Grand Prix will coincide with the first re-
opening stage of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, which is
undergoing a 292 million-pound ($462 million) transformation
scheduled to be completed by spring of 2014. The meet has
previously been held at Crystal Palace in south London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
