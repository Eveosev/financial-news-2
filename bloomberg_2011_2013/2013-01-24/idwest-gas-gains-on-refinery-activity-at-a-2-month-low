Midwest gasoline strengthened to the
highest level in nearly seven weeks as the region’s refineries
processed  the least  oil since November, pushing down supplies.  Refinery inputs of crude and other feedstock in PADD 2 sank
by 83,000 barrels to  3.31 million  barrels a day in the week
ended Jan. 18, the lowest level since Nov. 23, according to the
U.S. Energy Information Administration, an arm of the Energy
Department. Stockpiles of gasoline declined 727,000 barrels to
53.6 million, a second consecutive weekly drop.  Conventional,  87-octane gasoline  in the midcontinent, or
Group 3 region, rose 3.5 cents to 17 cents a gallon below
futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:15 p.m., the
smallest discount since Dec. 10. The gap has narrowed from 43.75
cents on Jan. 8 as  supplies  diminished and refineries began
preparing for maintenance.  Phillips 66 (PSX)  plans to conduct work starting in late February
at the Wood River refinery in  Illinois , a person familiar with
the turnaround schedule said yesterday.  With the capacity to process as much as 356,000 barrels a
day, the Illinois-based refinery is the second largest in the
Midwest behind BP Plc’s Whiting, Indiana, plant, which has a
capacity of 420,000 barrels.  Chicago, Gulf  Conventional gasoline  to be blended with ethanol in the
Chicago region gained 2.5 cents to 25 cents a gallon below Nymex
futures, a second consecutive advance. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel
in the region rose 2.25 cents to 9.5 cents below heating oil
futures, while the same fuel was unchanged at a 5 cent discount
in the Group 3 area.  Distillate supplies in the Midwest grew 958,000 barrels to
31.4 million last week, the Energy Department reported today.
The  3-2-1 crack spread,  or measure of refining profitability
based on West Texas Intermediate and ultra-low-sulfur diesel,
rose $1.23 to $22.65 a barrel.  The  3-2-1 spread  in the  Gulf Coast , measured by WTI in
Cushing, gained 50 cents to $22.90 a barrel. The spread based on
Light Louisiana Sweet oil rose $1.70 to $3.90 a barrel.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  the Gulf  gained 0.88
cent to 18.5 cents a gallon below futures. Supplies of motor
fuels in the region dropped 986,000 barrels to 82.8 million, the
EIA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
