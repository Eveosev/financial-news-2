     Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) --The  New York  Mets signed free-agent
pitcher Shaun Marcum, possibly completing their starting
rotation for the coming Major League Baseball season,  CBS sports 
reported.  Marcum, a right-hander, will join left-handers Johan
Santana and Jonathon Niese, as well as fellow righties Dillon
Gee and Matt Harvey, CBS said. The signing depends on Marcum
passing a physical.  Marcom, 31, was 7-4 with an earned run average of 3.70 last
season for the Milwaukee Brewers. He missed time with an elbow
injury.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
