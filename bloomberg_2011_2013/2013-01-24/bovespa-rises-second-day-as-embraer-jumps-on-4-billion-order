The  Bovespa (IBOV)  stock index rose for a
second day as  Embraer (EMBR3)  SA surged after signing an agreement to
sell 47 aircraft and as Brazil announced a plan to cut power
costs more than previously forecast to damp inflation.  Aircraft maker Embraer headed to the biggest advance in two
years after signing a $4 billion contract with  Republic Airways (RJET) 
Holdings Inc. State-controlled power utility  Centrais Eletricas
Brasileiras SA (ELET6)  fell the most on the stock gauge.  The Bovespa index rose 0.3 percent to 62,133.07 at 11:07
a.m. in Sao Paulo after President Dilma Rousseff said late
yesterday the cuts that go into effect today rather than early
next month will pare consumers’ power costs 18 percent and those
for industry by 32 percent, compared with the reductions of 16.2
percent and 28 percent she had announced in September.  “Dilma’s announcement has the goal of boosting growth in
the country,”  Andre Perfeito , the chief economist at Gradual
Investimentos, said by phone from Sao Paulo.  The real was little changed at 2.0357 per  U.S. dollar .  Embraer rose 8.5 percent to 15.88 reais, the biggest
advance on a closing basis since January 2011. Eletrobras, as
Centrais Eletricas is known, fell 1.7 percent to 12.90 reais.  Bull market  The Bovespa entered a bull market on Jan. 3 after rising 21
percent from last year’s low on June 5 as stimulus from central
banks around the world eased concern economic growth might miss
expectations while borrowing costs at a record low in Brazil
boosted equity demand. The index has since pared its advance to
18 percent.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge trades at 11.5 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 10.9 for MSCI’s measure of 21 developing nations’
equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume of stocks in  Sao Paulo  yesterday was 5.9
billion reais, compared with a daily average of 7.25 billion
reais in 2012, according to data compiled by the  exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
