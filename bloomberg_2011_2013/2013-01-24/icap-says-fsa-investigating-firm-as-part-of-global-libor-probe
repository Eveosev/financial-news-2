ICAP Plc (IAP) , the world’s largest broker
of transactions between banks, is being investigated by the
U.K.’s Financial Services Authority as part of its probe into
Libor-rigging.  “One of ICAP’s interdealer broker subsidiaries has been
notified that it is the subject of an FSA investigation,” the
London-based firm said in a statement today.  The regulator is examining whether the company helped
manipulate the London interbank offered rates for the Japanese
yen and possibly U.S. dollar, the Financial Times newspaper
reported earlier, citing a March 2012 FSA memo. The FSA has
assigned seven of the 50 people working on its investigation to
focus on ICAP’s activities, the newspaper said.  ICAP is already being probed by  Canada ’s Competition Bureau
for allegedly facilitating the manipulation of yen Libor by
panel banks including  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and Deutsche Bank AG, according to papers filed
with the Ontario Superior Court in May. ICAP said at the time
that it had received requests from government agencies probing
banks’ Libor submissions and is cooperating fully.  The firm suspended one employee and placed three others on
paid leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation, a
person familiar with the disciplinary procedures said last
month.  The shares fell as much as 5.9 percent and were down 3.6
percent at 315.5 pence as of 1:55 p.m. in London.  Interdealer brokers such as ICAP act as a go-between for
banks that trade bonds, stocks, currencies, energy and
derivatives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
