Dong Energy  A/S, Denmark’s biggest
utility, mistakenly anticipated power shortages in the U.K. when
it bought a gas-fired plant in  Wales  in 2009 that later became
unprofitable, Danish government auditors said.  Dong overestimated demand and underestimated supply before
purchasing the 824-megawatt  Severn  facility from Welsh Power
Group Ltd., leading it to assume the U.K. would suffer from a
lack of generation capacity, according to yesterday’s  report  by
the national auditor in Copenhagen.  “It would have been appropriate for Dong Energy to assess
price and market risks in greater detail before making the
decision,” according to the report. The auditor also criticized
the Finance Ministry for failing in its oversight of the
majority state-owned company’s investments.  Falling prices for emission permits since 2009 have made
power production cheaper for U.K. producers that burn coal,
displacing gas plants in the nation’s generation mix. European
Union carbon allowances for December 2012 fell more than 65
percent since May 2009, when they traded at more than 18 euros
($24) a metric ton, to their December expiration of 6.47 euros.  That has helped boost profits for coal-fired power plants.
The  clean-dark spread , a measure of power-plant profitability
based on coal, power and emission-permit prices, for next-month
U.K. power has tripled to 23.70 pounds a megawatt-hour as of
1:21 pm. London time from 7.93 in October 2009 when Bloomberg
began tracking the data. The  clean-spark spread , a similar
measure for gas-fired plants, fell to 1.86 pounds a megawatt-
hour from 10.08 pounds in the same period.  Plant Writedown  Dong wrote down about 27 percent of the 5.2 billion-kroner
($929 million) Severn plant investment in the first half of
2012, according to the auditor’s report.  Ulrik Froehlke, a company spokesman based in Gentofte,
 Denmark , couldn’t comment when reached by phone today. The
Finance Ministry won’t comment on the matter until Jan. 30, when
auditors give their official statements, a ministry official
said from Copenhagen today, requesting anonymity, citing policy.  Dong expects low coal and carbon prices to continue to make
gas-fired power stations less profitable than ones operating on
coal for the next few years, forcing gas plants to limit
operation to a “limited amount of hours,” according to its
2012 first-half  earnings statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
