The European Parliament’s industry
committee recommended rejection of a plan to strengthen the
bloc’s carbon market in a non-binding opinion today.  The panel has an advisory role in the legislative process.
The environment committee, which is leading work on the draft
measure in the parliament, is scheduled to vote on it next
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
