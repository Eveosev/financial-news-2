Cotton futures rose for the seventh
straight session, the longest rally in almost two years, on bets
that production will drop in the U.S. as demand rebounds in
China. Sugar, cocoa and orange juice declined.  Output in the U.S., the world’s largest exporter, may drop
to 14 million bales this year from 17 million last season as
farmers turn to more profitable crops including corn and
soybeans, Rabobank International said today. A smaller crop in
China, the largest user, means domestic supply will lag behind
demand, the bank said. Prices are up 8.7 percent in January,
headed for the biggest monthly gain since February 2011.  “The possibility of lower acres and lower production in
the U.S. is bringing in speculative money,”  Sid Love , president
of Joe Kropf and Sid Love Consulting Services, said in a
telephone interview from Overland Park,  Kansas .  Cotton for March delivery rose 1.5 percent to 81.66 cents a
pound at 11:24 a.m. on ICE Futures in New York, after reaching
81.82 cents, the highest for a most-active contract since since
May 10. Prices rallied 6.6 percent in the six previous session.  On Jan. 15, money managers and speculators held long
positions, or bets on higher prices, that exceeded shorts by
24,944 futures and options, up 8.8 percent from a week earlier,
government data show. Speculators were net-short on cotton as
recently as Nov. 27.  Export sales  jumped 73 percent  in the week ending Jan. 10,
with purchases led by  China , U.S. Department of Agriculture data
show. The agency will update weekly figures tomorrow.  “We anticipate the cotton market will be supported by
Chinese imports and that reserve selling will not be a negative
factor for prices,” Rabobank said in a report today.  A bale of cotton weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery fell 0.5 percent to
18.4 cents a pound on ICE, heading for the seventh decline in
eight sessions.  Cocoa futures for March delivery fell 1.4 percent to $2,185
a metric ton in New York, after sinking to $2,178, the lowest
for a most-active contract since July 18.  Orange-juice futures for March delivery slumped 1.3 percent
to $1.141 a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporters on this story:
