Two members of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission  objected  to a report on suitability
requirements for complex financial products put out by an
international group.  The  document , issued by the International Organization of
Securities Commissions on Jan. 21, sets out nine “principles”
that include distinguishing between individual and institutional
investors, adequately disclosing risks and making sure a
customer understands an investment’s structure. The guidelines
are intended for distributors of securities, such as brokers.
The SEC, which currently lacks one of its five commissioners,
didn’t approve the report.  “In our view, the Final Report does not accurately reflect
the relevant law in the U.S.,” SEC commissioners Troy Paredes
and Daniel Gallagher said in a statement. “We especially
disagree with the Final Report’s failure to properly respect the
distinction between retail and institutional investors when
determining the suitability requirements that should apply.”  Complex products have features and risks that “are not
reasonably likely to be understood by a retail customer,”
according to the report.  IOSCO, whose members include regulators in more than 100
countries, is a policy forum that tries to develop and implement
international oversight and enforcement standards. The board is
made up of representatives from 32 securities regulators,
including the SEC.  Messages left with representatives for Paredes and
Gallagher weren’t returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
