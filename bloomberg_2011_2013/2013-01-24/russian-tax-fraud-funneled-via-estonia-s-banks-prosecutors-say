Estonian bank accounts were used in
2008 to transfer about $10 million of funds connected to a
Russian  tax-fraud  case, the state prosecutors’ office said.  The transfers, related to alleged embezzlement uncovered by
lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, were uncovered in an investigation
conducted last year by the financial intelligence unit of
 Estonia ’s police, Carol Merzin, a spokeswoman at the state
prosecutors’ office, said today by phone from the capital,
Tallinn, confirming earlier comments by state prosecutor Piret
Paukstys to newspaper  Eesti Paeevaleht .  Estonian authorities opted not to open a criminal case
because the transfers were made via Internet transactions, with
the funds then moved to other countries using accounts belonging
to non-resident companies represented by foreign nationals,
according to prosecutors’ office. It declined to identify the
banks involved.  Magnitsky, who advised London-based Hermitage Capital,
alleged Russian officials committed a $230 million tax fraud. He
died at age 37 in November 2009 after being beaten to death and
denied medical care during almost a year in pre-trial detention
on fabricated tax evasion charges, according to a Russian
presidential human rights body.  Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev yesterday said
Magnitsky’s case has been “politicized” by investors. It has
sparked a diplomatic rift with the U.S. as Russia retaliated for
human-rights sanctions passed by Congress by barring Americans
from adopting Russian orphans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
