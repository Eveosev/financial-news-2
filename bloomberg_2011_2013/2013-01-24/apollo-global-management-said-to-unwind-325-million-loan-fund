Leon Black’s  Apollo Global
Management LLC (APO)  is seeking to unwind a $325 million
collateralized loan obligation it raised in 2010 after the fund
ended its reinvestment period, according to two people with
knowledge of the matter  The firm is seeking buyers for about $200.4 million of
loans made to about 100 borrowers including  Calpine Corp. (CPN)  and
Hertz Corp., which the ALM Loan Funding 2010-1 CLO still holds,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the sale
is private. Bids are due tomorrow at 11 a.m. in  New York , the
people said.  New York-based Apollo is liquidating the fund after loan
prices improved 11.5 percent since the start of 2010, as
measured by the S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index. The pool
ended its reinvestment period, the time in which it can buy new
loans, last year, the people said.  When a CLO exits that period it must use cash to pay down
the debt rather than buy more new loans. About 80 percent of
existing CLOs will end their reinvestment period at the end of
2014, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc data.  Charles Zehren, a spokesman at Rubenstein Associates for
Apollo, declined to comment  Apollo, which managed $109.7 billion in assets as of Sept.
30, managed 26 CLOs as of June 30, according to  news releases. 
The lowest portion, or the so-called equity slice of the ALM
CLO, may return more than 15 percent when the sale process, also
known as a bids wanted in competition, is completed, one of the
people said. Apollo sold the $325 million deal, its first, with
Citigroup Inc. in May 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  CLO Holdings  The bid list for the Apollo CLO includes a $5.7 million
piece of Asurion Corp.’s term loan, a $4.5 million piece of
Freescale Semiconductor Inc.’s debt and $4.9 million of Cengage
Learning Inc.’s borrowings, the people said.  The deal was among the first backed by widely syndicated
loans raised in 2010, in which just $3.5 billion of funds were
issued, according to Bloomberg data. There were $52.6 billion of
such deals raised last year. At the height of the market in
2007, $91.1 billion of CLOs backed by widely syndicated loans
were arranged, according to Morgan Stanley data.   CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  The funds were the largest buyer of leveraged loans, the
approximately $500 billion market that backs mergers and
acquisitions, in the third quarter of 2012 with 54 percent
market share, according to a study from the New York-based Loan
Syndications and Trading Association.  Leveraged loans, those rated below BBB- by  Standard &
Poor’s  and less than Baa3 at  Moody’s Investors Service (MCO) , returned
9.7 percent in 2012, according to the JPMorgan Leveraged Loan
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
