Ukraine’s economy is set to shrink
in 2013,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said, contradicting Prime
Minister  Mykola Azarov ’s 3 percent-4 percent growth forecast.  Gross domestic product will probably contract 1.8 percent
this year, Andrew Matheny, a Moscow-based analyst at Goldman,
said today by e-mail. GDP, which fell 1.3 percent from a year
earlier in the third quarter, dropped 1.8 percent in the fourth
as industry and export weakness pushed Ukraine into its first
recession since 2009, Goldman Sachs estimated in a Jan. 23 note.  “Ukraine has seen its macroeconomic fundamentals
deteriorate in the past year as a result of a sharp negative
terms-of-trade shock, rising external government redemptions,
and a worsening fiscal position,” Goldman Sachs wrote. “The
economy is now likely in a recession.”  Ukraine is seeking international aid as its  economy  suffers
from weaker demand for exports such as steel. An International
Monetary Fund mission is due to arrive next week for talks on a
third bailout since 2008 after foreign reserves fell to the
lowest level in almost three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
