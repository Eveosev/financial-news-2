McCormick & Co. (MKC) , a maker of spices
and other flavored products, fell the most in more than three
years after forecasting annual earnings and sales that trailed
analysts’ estimates.  McCormick tumbled 6.3 percent to close at $62.37 in  New
York , it’s biggest one-day decline since March 2009. The company
 gained  26 percent last year, while the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index advanced 13 percent.  McCormick, which sells brands under its own name, Lawry’s
and Club House, said the spice and seasoning category are
growing between 3 percent and 8 percent in major markets.
However, higher sales and cost savings will probably be impacted
by an increased  tax rate  and retirement benefit costs at the
Sparks, Maryland-based company.  “Importantly, we do not regard the headwinds from these
increases as an impediment to achieving our long-term growth
outlook in 2014 and beyond,” Chief Executive Officer Alan D.
Wilson said in a statement today.  McCormick forecast 2013 earnings of $3.15 to $3.23 a share.
That compared to an average analyst estimate of $3.36, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company also projected sales
growth of 3 percent to 5 percent in local currency. Analysts had
estimated sales of $4.3 billion in 2013, a more than 7 percent
jump from last year when it posted $4 billion.  Fourth-quarter net income was $148.5 million, or $1.11 a
share, compared with $131.7 million, or 98 cents, a year
earlier, the company said. Analysts had estimated $1.14. Revenue
$1.15 billion trailed an an average estimate of $1.17 billion.  International Markets  McCormick, which  gets  about 40 percent of its revenue from
international markets, said consumer sales in  Europe , the  Middle
East , and  Africa  advanced 3 percent in the quarter. Excluding
the impact of acquisitions and currency, such sales rose 7
percent in  Asia , Pacific, led by double-digit growth in  China ,
according to the statement.  The company is starting 2013 with “sluggish European and
Chinese markets” and “continued cost inflation,” Jonathan Feeney, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in
Philadelphia, wrote in an investor note. He has a neutral rating
on the stock.  “The market appeared to be anticipating an earnings step-
up,” Feeney wrote. “We see a more steady performance tempered
by some modest Europe and macro risk.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
