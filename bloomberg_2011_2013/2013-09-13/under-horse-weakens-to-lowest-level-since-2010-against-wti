Thunder Horse crude slipped to the
weakest level against West Texas Intermediate in almost three
years as increasing shipments from the central U.S. gave Texas
and Louisiana refineries more ways to acquire supply.  Thunder Horse traded at a discount to WTI for a fourth day,
down from a $22.50 premium in February. Oils from the Gulf have
declined against WTI as crude has moved to area refineries from
Cushing,  Oklahoma , where stockpiles have dropped to 34.1 million
barrels from 49.7 million at the end of June.  Thunder Horse fell 15 cents a barrel to 65 cents below WTI
at 1:46 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was
its lowest level since Oct. 28, 2010.  The premiums for Light Louisiana Sweet and Heavy Louisiana
Sweet over WTI fell by 5 cents and 15 cents a barrel,
respectively, to $1.55 and $1.85.  Eugene Island crude’s discount narrowed by 5 cents to 70
cents. Bonito Sour gained 5 cents to a 65-cent discount.  Poseidon’s discount shrank 25 cents to $3.60. Southern
Green Canyon fell 10 cents a barrel to a $5.75 discount. Mars
Blend was unchanged at a discount of $3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
