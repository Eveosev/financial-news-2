The Philippine peso headed for its
best week in 15 months after exports beat estimates and foreign
investors pumped money into local stocks.  The currency touched a one-month high on Sept. 11, a day
after a government report showed overseas shipments expanded 2.3
percent in July, compared with the median estimate for a 1
percent decline in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Global
funds bought $110 million more Philippine shares than they sold
this week through yesterday, set to snap five weeks of net
sales, exchange data show.  “Risk sentiment is improving, and that was positive for
 emerging markets  in general this week,” said Tohru Nishihama,
an economist covering developing nations at Dai-ichi Life
Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo . “An unexpected gain in
exports added to appreciation pressure on the peso.”  The peso strengthened 1.3 percent from a week ago, the most
since the period ended June 15, 2012, to 43.905 per dollar as of
10:50 a.m. in  Manila , Tullett Prebon Plc data show. The
currency, which was little changed today, touched 43.65 on Sept.
11, the highest level since Aug. 12.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, slumped 52 basis
points this week to 6.49 percent. The gauge was little changed
today.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas held its benchmark rate at 3.5
percent yesterday for a seventh meeting, keeping it at a record
low as easing inflation gave policy makers room to support
 Southeast Asia ’s fastest-growing major economy. Inflation slowed
to a four-year low of 2.1 percent in August, official data show.  The yield on the government’s 8 percent bonds due July 2031
dropped 11 basis points from Sept. 6 to 4.84 percent, according
to prices from Tradition Financial Services. The rate fell four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
