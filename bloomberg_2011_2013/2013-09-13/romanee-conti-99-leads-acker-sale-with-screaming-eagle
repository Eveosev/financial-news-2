An assorted case of 1999 Domaine de
la Romanee-Conti fetched $46,740 at an Acker Merrall & Condit
wine sale in  New York  this month, matching the auction house’s
estimate, as Burgundy accounted for three of the top five lots.  Two half-cases of La Tache DRC 2008 sold for $29,520 and an
assorted case of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti 2000 went for
$27,060, according to an Acker statement on the Sept. 7 sale.  The demand for older Burgundy vintages at auction is in
contrast to the muted appetite in recent months for Bordeaux
wines, although that is now showing some signs of revival. The
Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index of top Bordeaux vintages has risen 4
percent this year, paring the decline since the peak of the
market in June 2011 to 29 percent.  “The slowdown’s already happened,” Tom Gearing, director
of Cult Wines Ltd., a wine-investment company based in Richmond,
 England , said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “The
Pulse” with  Guy Johnson . “There was a slowdown from midway
through 2011 which found a bottom in the market at the end of
2012.”  Other leading lots in the Acker sale included 18 bottles of
Napa Valley producer Screaming Eagle spanning the years from
1992 to 2010, which sold for $39,360, and a case of Chateau
Lafite-Rothschild 1982 Pauillac, which fetched $36,900.  Vintage Petrus  Pomerol producer Petrus also featured among the top 10
lots, with a six-liter imperial of Petrus 2005 selling for
$24,600, a case of the 1996 vintage fetching $19,680 and six
bottles of the 2000 selling for $18,450.  Petrus, Screaming Eagle and Romanee-Conti are all vineyards
with small production, adding a rarity premium to the price of
their wines. The Romanee-Conti vineyard in Vosne-Romanee is
slightly smaller than 2 hectares (5 acres) and has its own
appellation as a Burgundy grand cru wine.  The Acker auction, with more than 95 percent of lots sold,
raised a total of $3.15 million.  Following is a table of major wine auctions held so far
