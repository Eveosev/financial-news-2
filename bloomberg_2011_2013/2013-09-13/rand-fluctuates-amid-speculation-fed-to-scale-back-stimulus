The rand fluctuated between gains
and losses as it headed for a second weekly advance against the
dollar on speculation that U.S. policy makers will provide
clarity on plans to scale back monetary stimulus.  The U.S. currency strengthened against all except two of
its 16 major counterparts before a report that economists said
will show retail sales accelerated in the world’s biggest
economy, boosting bets the  Federal Reserve  will start tapering
bond purchases next week. The South African central bank will
leave the key repurchase rate unchanged at 5 percent on Sept.
19, according to all 12 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “A return of Fed fears has broken the incipient rally in
emerging-market currencies,”  John Cairns , a strategist at Rand
Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said in an e-mail. “Data risk is
high given all the U.S. figures due this afternoon. Expect jumpy
and nervous trade.”  South Africa ’s currency gained as much as 0.3 percent and
weakened as much as 0.2 percent before trading less than 0.1
percent higher at 9.9671 per dollar as of 10:35 a.m. in
Johannesburg, bringing its advance in the week to 0.5 percent.
Yields on 10.5 percent bonds due December 2026 were little
changed at 8.16 percent for a decline of 24 basis points this
week.  Foreign investors  bought  a net 1.81 billion rand ($182
million) of South African bonds yesterday, according to JSE Ltd.
