Emirates Team  New Zealand  swept
both races yesterday to take a 6-0 lead against defending
champion Oracle Team USA in the 34th  America’s Cup  competition.  New Zealand won the first race by 47 seconds and the second
by one minute, six seconds to move within three points of
claiming the trophy. Oracle, starting the competition two points
down after an international jury imposed a penalty, has won one
race and needs 10 more victories to keep the title.  “It’s only two-thirds of the way to actually winning the
cup,” said New Zealand skipper Dean Barker. “One bad day out
there and momentum changes and things can be quite different.
We’re under no illusion, there’s still a very hard road ahead.”  Racing on San Francisco Bay resumes tomorrow with two races
scheduled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
