Honeywell International Inc. (HON) ’s
$600 million purchase of  Intermec Inc. (IN)  won approval from the
U.S. Federal Trade Commission on the condition that it license
patents for barcode scanners.  Honeywell agreed to license patents used in the
manufacture of two-dimensional scanners to Bologna, Italy-based
 Datalogic SpA (DAL)  under a settlement with the FTC that resolves
claims the deal as originally proposed would be anticompetitive,
the agency said today in a statement.  “Licensing requirements can preserve competition in
markets where access to needed technology is the main barrier to
entry,” said Deborah Feinstein, director of the FTC’s bureau of
competition. “The proposed order gives Datalogic access to the
patents it needs to enter the U.S. market immediately and
restore the competition lost due to the merger.”  Honeywell, the Morris Township, New Jersey-based maker of
flight controls and thermostats, announced in December the
agreement to buy Everett, Washington-based Intermec, a provider
of radio frequency-identification products.  Two-dimensional scan engines translate barcodes into a
digital format that computer processors can interpret and
analyze. Retail store scanners, kiosks and rugged mobile
handheld computers use the engines to capture digital data, the
FTC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
