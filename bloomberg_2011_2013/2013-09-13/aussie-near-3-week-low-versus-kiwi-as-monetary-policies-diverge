Australia ’s dollar held near the
lowest in more than three weeks against its  New Zealand 
counterpart on speculation the monetary policies of the two
nations will diverge before the  Reserve Bank  of Australia
releases next week minutes of its last meeting.  The kiwi dollar was poised for weekly gains against 14 of
its 16 major peers after the  Reserve Bank of New Zealand 
signaled yesterday policy makers may raise rates in 2014 and
data today showed manufacturing industry expanded. Australian
bonds fell as U.S. Treasury yields rose on bets the  Federal
Reserve  will reduce its asset purchases next week.  “The Aussie-kiwi will, in general, remain under some
downward pressure,” said Peter Dragicevich, a currency
economist in Sydney at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the
nation’s biggest lender. “The divergence between the RBA and
the RBNZ remains clear and that’s keeping the  interest-rate 
differential between Australia and New Zealand skewed in kiwi’s
favor. We think there’s a high risk that the RBA does reinsert
its easing bias in the minutes.”  The Aussie was little changed at NZ$1.1390 as of 10:26 a.m.
in Sydney from yesterday, when it touched NZ$1.1338, the lowest
since Aug. 20. It’s poised for a 0.8 percent drop this week.
Australia’s currency slid 0.1 percent to 92.59 U.S. cents from
yesterday, when it reached 93.54 cents, the strongest since June
19. It bought 92.28 yen from 92.29 yesterday, set for a 1.4
percent weekly gain.  New Zealand’s dollar traded at 81.31 cents from 81.38
yesterday, when it reached 81.58, the highest since Aug. 19. The
kiwi has gained 1.6 percent against the greenback this week and
jumped 2.2 percent versus its Japanese peer to 81.03 yen.  Bonds Drop  Australian  government bonds  fell, with the  yield  on 10-year
note rising six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 4.10
percent. The yield on similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries added two
basis points to 2.93 percent.  The RBA on Sept. 17 will release minutes of its meeting on
Sept. 3, when the central bank kept the benchmark interest rate
on hold at a record-low 2.5 percent and omitted a reference to
scope for further stimulus.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see a 33 percent chance Governor  Glenn Stevens  and his policy
board will reduce rates by the end of the year.  Rate Increase  New Zealand’s central bank yesterday forecast that bank
bill rates will be higher than previously estimated in the first
half of 2014, indicating the RBNZ may raise benchmark borrowing
costs within that period.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive a floating rate, rose two basis points to 3.55 percent
from yesterday, when it touched 3.56 percent, the most since
August 2011.  The nation’s  Performance of Manufacturing Index  fell to
57.5 in August from 59.5 in July, which was the highest since
June 2004, Business New Zealand and the Bank of New Zealand Ltd.
said in a statement released in Wellington today. A reading
above 50 indicates expansion.  The Fed is forecast to slow its monthly buying to $75
billion from the current $85 billion pace at its Sept. 17-18
meeting, the median estimate of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg
