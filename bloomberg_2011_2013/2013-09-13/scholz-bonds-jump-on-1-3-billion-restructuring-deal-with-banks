Bonds of Scholz AG jumped to the
highest in six weeks after the German metals recycler reached a
restructuring agreement with banks.  The companyâ€™s 182.5 million euros ($242 million) of 8.5
percent senior unsecured notes due March 2017 rose about 9 cents
to 85 cents on the euro, the highest since Aug. 1, at 1:05 p.m.
in  London , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Scholz agreed to reduce debt to about 700 million euros
from 1 billion euros by selling its stainless steel and aluminum
units, according to a Sept. 12 statement from the Essingen,
Germany-based firm. The lenders provided a 40 million-euro
 credit line  to fund its operations and to pay restructuring
costs.  Scholz, which  reported  a drop in sales and earnings in May,
forecasts a loss for 2013 and said it may be necessary to raise
cash by selling shares to new investors. It appointed Rothschild
to offload the two units, it said in the statement.  The closely held company obtained a 500 million-euro senior
secured syndicated loan last year arranged by  Bayerische
Landesbank , Commerzbank AG, Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg and
Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It raised more than 650 million euros of other
loans at the same time, lenders said. The bonds were sold to
investors in March 2012, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
