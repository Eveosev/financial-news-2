Indianapolis Colts running back
Vick Ballard probably will miss the rest of the National
Football League season after injuring his knee in practice.  Ballard, 23, tore the anterior cruciate ligament of his
right knee during a non-contact exercise yesterday and will be
placed on injured reserve, Colts coach Chuck Pagano said today
at a news conference. An isolated ACL tear typically takes at
least six months recovery.  Ballard made 12 starts as a rookie last year, rushing for
814 yards and two touchdowns. Last week against the  Oakland
Raiders , he ran the ball 13 times for 63 yards.  Former New York Giants running back  Ahmad Bradshaw  and
Donald Brown will see increased playing time in Ballard’s
absence, Pagano said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
