Treasuries rose for a third day as
reports showed retail sales increased less than forecast and
 consumer confidence  slid more than projected, suggesting the
economic expansion is struggling to gain momentum.  The combination added to speculation that the Federal
Reserve may be less aggressive than some investors anticipated
in slowing its bond-buying program when policy makers meet Sept.
17-18. Yields climbed last week to the highest since July 2011
before a report showed employment gains in August trailed
forecasts. Rates on six-month bills declined to the lowest level
since October 2011.  “We got pretty weak U.S. data across the board so there’s
been pretty good buying,” said Jason Rogan, managing director
of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New
York-based brokerage for institutional investors. “People are
trying to be a bit nimble in front of the Fed. There’s a lot of
cash on the sidelines.”  The 10-year  yield  fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.89 percent at 4:59 p.m. New York time.
The price of the 2.5 percent note due in August 2023 rose 7/32,
or $2.19 per $1,000 face amount, to 96 22/32. The yield
increased earlier as much as five basis points. It declined to
2.86 percent yesterday, the lowest level since Sept. 4, after
reaching a two-year high of 3.01 percent on Sept. 6. The yield
decreased five basis points on the week.  Rates (USGG6M)  on six-month bills declined to 0.01 percent, the
lowest level since Oct. 18, 2011 before closing at 0.015
percent. It reached a 2013 high of 0.14 percent on Feb. 22.  “They are parking money in bills,” Rogan of Guggenheim
said. People are waiting to “see what happens with the Fed and
the tapering talk.”  Futures Reversal  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators reversed
bets on 30-year bond futures in the week ending Sept. 10,
according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 17,063 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade.  The prior week, traders were net-short 8,963
contracts. A short position is a bet that the price of a
security will fall.  U.S. government bonds have lost investors 0.5 percent since
the end of August, set for a fifth monthly decline, the longest
since a seven-month slump ended March 2011, according to the
 Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index. (BUSY)  The securities have lost
investors 3.8 percent in 2013, according to data as of
yesterday.  Confidence Sags  Retail sales rose in August 0.2 percent, the  least  in four
months, following a revised 0.4 percent July gain that was
bigger than previously estimated, the Commerce Department
reported. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a 0.5 percent advance.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
September index of consumer sentiment fell to 76.8 from 82.1
last month, which was the lowest since April. A Bloomberg survey
estimated a reading of 82.  A Labor Department report on Sept. 6 showed the U.S. added
169,000 workers in August, falling short of the 180,000-job
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  The Federal Open Market Committee will decide at its Sept.
17-18 meeting to reduce monthly purchases of Treasuries to $35
billion from $45 billion, according to the median of 34
responses in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Policy makers
will maintain mortgage-bond buying at  $40 billion  under the
Fed’s quantitative-easing program, the survey shows.  “It will be a soft launch,” said  Tom Porcelli , chief U.S.
economist at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital Markets, one of
the 21 primary dealers that trade with the central bank. “The
Fed will taper next week -- about $10 billion split evenly.”  Won’t ’Disappoint’  The Fed bought $3.7 billion today of Treasuries maturing
from June 2019 to June 2020 as part of its stimulus effort.  “The marketplace has come to just about expect the Fed to
take some modest action and they’re not going to at this point
disappoint the market,” said Guy Haselmann, an interest-rate
strategist in New York at primary dealer  Bank of Nova Scotia. (BNS)   The U.S. central bank has kept the  federal-funds target
rate  at a record-low range of zero to 0.25 percent since
December 2008. The Fed will release its 2016 economic
 projections  next week for the first time, including the outlook
for the benchmark rate.  In their June  assessment , 19 FOMC members were divided on
the appropriate benchmark rate in 2015, with four participants
saying 1 percent. Three projected 3 percent, the other three
forecast 1.5 percent and another three saw 0.75 percent.  The median forecast of analysts’ predictions compiled by
Bloomberg News from Sept. 6 to Sept. 11, is for the 10-year
yield to end the year at 2.85 percent and to rise to 3.1 percent
by the end of June 2014.  Higher Demand  Demand for U.S. government debt increased this week at the
auctions of $65 billion of U.S. notes and bonds. The $13 billion
of 30-year debt sold yesterday attracted bids valued at 2.4
times the amount offered, versus 2.11 last month. The bid-to-cover ratio rose to 2.86 at the $21 billion offering of 10-year
notes on Sept. 11, from 2.45 last month, while the three-year
note sale on Sept. 10 had the ratio rise to 3.29 from 3.21.  The auctions experienced higher demand even as the broader
Treasury market struggles and as Verizon Communications Inc.
sold a record $49 billion in debt. The U.S. will sell $13
billion in 10-year inflation-linked debt Sept. 19.  Chairman Speculation  Treasuries fell earlier as the Nikkei said former U.S.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers will be the next Fed
chairman. A White House spokesman said later President  Barack
Obama  has made no decision on who will succeed Ben S. Bernanke,
whose term as chairman ends in January.  Thirty-five percent of investors, analysts and traders who
are Bloomberg subscribers say Summers may provide less stimulus
than Bernanke, compared with 13 percent who see Summers with
looser policy and 22 percent saying it’d be the same. Forty-seven percent see current Vice Chairman Janet Yellen presiding
over the same policy if she succeeds Bernanke, with 17 percent
saying it’d be looser and 8 percent saying tighter. The survey
was conducted on Sept. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
