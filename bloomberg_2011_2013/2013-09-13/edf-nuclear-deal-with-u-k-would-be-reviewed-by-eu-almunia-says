Electricite de France SA ’s deal
with the U.K. to build the nation’s first new nuclear plant in
two decades will be probed by the European Union once an
agreement is struck and regulators are informed, the EU’s
antitrust chief said.  “The U.K. government has announced to us that they will
notify in the coming months a program linked with investments in
nuclear energy, in new plants,” Joaquin Almunia, the EU’s
competition commissioner, said in the margins of a conference in
Florence, Italy. “Once this notification will take place we
will need to assess if this scheme, this program complies or
not” with the EU’s rules.  EDF’s plans to build two  Areva SA (AREVA)  reactors at Hinkley Point
in southwest England hinge on the price it will get for the
power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
