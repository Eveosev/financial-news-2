The Czech Senate passed a law to
end state support for most green-power projects starting up from
next year as the government seeks to cut costs for consumers.  The upper house approved the law drafted in July, according
to the website of the Senate, the nation’s sole legislative body
after the lower house was dissolved before an election.  Subsidies for renewables, particularly solar, have raised
prices for households and industry in the past three years as
costs are passed onto consumers. That has threatened industry’s
competitiveness, Prime Minister Jiri Rusnok said in July.  Solar plants connected to the grid after Dec. 31 won’t get
subsidies. Hydro, wind and biomass power plants that received
construction permits this year will be eligible for support if
they’re completed before the end of 2014. Hydro plants with less
than 10 megawatts of capacity will be eligible for subsidies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
