The pound strengthened to a seven-month high against the dollar as a government report showing
construction output accelerated in July added to signs Britain’s
economic recovery is gaining momentum.  The U.K. currency climbed to the strongest since January
versus the euro as industry data showed  house prices  rose to a
record last month as government measures boosted demand.
Sterling also rallied before the  Bank of England  releases the
minutes of its September meeting next week amid speculation
policy makers will have to raise  interest rates  sooner than they
have projected. U.K. government bonds advanced for a third day.  “The pound has room to outperform further in the near term
because of positive surprises in economic data,” said Arne Rasmussen, head of currency research at Danske Bank A/S in
Copenhagen. “The market appears to be more optimistic about the
economic outlook than the Bank of England. We think the Bank of
England will prove right in the end and the pound appreciation
will lose some steam.”  The pound gained 0.4 percent to $1.5866 at 4:43 p.m.  London 
time after rising to $1.5877, the highest since Feb. 1. The U.K.
currency appreciated 0.5 percent to 83.70 pence per euro after
advancing to 83.57 pence, the strongest since Jan. 18.  Construction Expands  U.K.  construction , which accounts for 6.3 percent of the
economy, increased 2.2 percent from June and was 2 percent
higher than a year earlier, according to the  Office for National
Statistics  in London. House prices increased 0.4 percent from
July to an average 233,776 pounds, Acadametrics and LSL Property
Services Plc said.  The U.K. economy will expand 1.3 percent this year and 2
percent in 2014, according to the median of 53 analysts in a
monthly survey by  Bloomberg News . The pace of growth projected
for next year would be the fastest since 2007.  Sterling has rallied 7.6 percent in the past six months,
the best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar gained 0.6
percent and the euro advanced 3.3 percent.  The Bank of England will boost its benchmark rate from 0.5
percent in the first half of 2015, according to a Bloomberg
Global Poll of investors, analysts and traders. Governor  Mark Carney  has said officials can wait until the end of 2016 before
raising borrowing costs.  The central bank will release the minutes of its Sept. 4-5
meeting on Sept. 18.  ‘Very Positive’  “The prospects for the pound are very positive over the
next 12 months,” said Michael Sneyd, a foreign-exchange
strategist at BNP Paribas SA in London, speaking to Anna Edwards
on Bloomberg Television’s “On the Move” program. “U.K. growth
is finally recovering. It seems like the U.K. is finally
reaching the escape velocity that we’ve been waiting for for
several years.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt fell three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.92 percent. The 2.25
percent bond maturing in September 2023 rose 0.22, or 2.20
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 94.27.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 4.6 percent this year
through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
