Taiwan ’s dollar headed for the best
week in two months as overseas funds boosted holdings of local
stocks amid a current-account surplus.  Global funds bought $1.3 billion more Taiwanese shares than
they sold this week as the  Taiex (TWSE)  index added 0.1 percent, taking
the net purchases this year to $3.9 billion, exchange data show.
The island recorded a current-account  excess  of $13.8 billion in
the second quarter, official data showed last month. The Federal
Reserve will reduce bond purchases that have spurred capital
flows into emerging markets at its Sept. 17-18 meeting,
according to 65 percent of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “I think there’ll be a degree of funds rotating out of
Asean  emerging markets  and into Korea and Taiwan,” said Trang Thuy Le, a Singapore-based currency strategist at Credit Suisse
Group AG. “Even if the Fed comes out more hawkish than people
expect, the Korean won and Taiwan dollar will still have the
scope to strengthen, and outperform the region, given current-account flows are seasonally very strong right now.”  The Taiwan dollar strengthened 0.64 percent this week, the
most since the five days through July 13, and 0.3 percent today
to NT$29.714 against the greenback as of 10:24 a.m., Taipei
Forex Inc. prices show. The currency was trading 0.5 percent
stronger five minutes before the 4 p.m. close yesterday and
finished 0.2 percent higher. The central bank has sold the local
dollar in the run-up to the close on most days since March 2012,
according to traders who asked not to be identified.  Forwards, Volatility  One-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.1 percent this
week and today to NT$29.685 per dollar, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, fell
10 basis points this week and one basis point today to 4.08
percent.  The yield on Taiwan’s bonds due September 2023 dropped one
basis point this week to 1.781 percent in when-issued trading
before tomorrow’s auction. The rate increased two basis points
today. Government bonds have declined in the last four weeks.
The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady this week and
today at 0.388 percent, a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
