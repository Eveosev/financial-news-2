Egis Nyrt., the Hungarian drugmaker
owned by Laboratoires Servier, jumped to the highest in more
than a week after getting European Commission approval for the
sale of its Remsima drug.  The shares rose as much as 2.9 percent and closed up 1.5
percent in Budapest trading at 20,600 forint, the highest since
Sept. 3. Egis was the biggest gainer in the 13-member BUX  index ,
which rose 0.7 percent. The stock climbed 3 percent in the week,
the most since the five days through June 28.  Remsima, used to treat autoimmune diseases, is one of eight
products the company acquired the right to sell under an
agreement with South Korean partner  Celltrion Inc. (068270)  Egis will
sell it in central and eastern European countries including
 Hungary ,  Poland ,  Romania  and the  Czech Republic , according to a
 statement  to the Budapest Stock Exchange today.  “The move is positive” and will boost Egis’s operating
profit, Attila Vago, a Budapest-based equity analyst at Concorde
Securities, Hungary’s largest brokerage, said by phone. “Egis
is one of the most undervalued shares on the market now.”  Concorde has an overweight recommendation on Egis, with a
price target of 26,000 forint. All eight  analysts  tracked by
Bloomberg recommend buying the stock.  Egis trades at 8.6 times earnings for the past 12 months,
the lowest ratio among seven eastern European pharmaceutical
companies, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
