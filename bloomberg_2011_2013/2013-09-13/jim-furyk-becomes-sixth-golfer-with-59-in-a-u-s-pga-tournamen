Jim Furyk  became the sixth player
to shoot a round of 59 in a U.S. PGA Tour event, going 12 under
par in today’s second round of the BMW Championship.  Furyk, 43, had 11 birdies, an eagle and a bogey in his
record-tying round of 59 at Conway Farms Golf Club in Lake
Forest, Illinois, site of the third event in the Tour’s four-tournament playoff series.  Furyk is now 11 under for the tournament after a 1-over 72
yesterday, tied for the lead with fellow American Brandt
Snedeker heading into the weekend.  Stuart Appleby had been the most recent golfer to shoot a
59, in the final round of the 2010 Greenbrier Classic.  Paul
Goydos ,  David Duval , Chip Beck and Al Geiberger are the only
others with 59s in an official PGA Tour round. Bo Van Pelt shot
a 59 during the Phoenix Open Pro-Am this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
