Two cases of 2006 Chateau Lafite-Rothschild sold for 5,300 pounds ($8,380) a case on the London
Liv-ex market yesterday, 9.4 percent down from its 2013 high
amid selling pressure from investors in top Bordeaux wines.  The vintage changed hands at 5,500 pounds as recently as
last week, and the deal took it down to the level at which it
was regularly trading back in February, according to data on
Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, tracking leading Bordeaux
vintages, has declined since March 15, paring an 8 percent gain
made in the previous 10 weeks to leave it 4 percent up since the
start of this year. Lafite, a first-growth wine estate in the
Pauillac region on the left bank of the Gironde estuary, is one
of the highest-priced growers of Medoc with Chateau Latour,
Chateau Mouton-Rothschild and Chateau Margaux.  “We’ve seen prices for some of the top wines come down,”
Tom Gearing, director of Cult Wines Ltd., a wine investment
company based in Richmond,  England , said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” with Guy Johnson. “The
wine market has now found a bottom. We have seen a market
correction.”  While the vintage has declined 38 percent from its peak of
8,594 pounds a case attained in February 2011, it is still 74
percent above the level of 3,050 pounds at which it traded in
June 2007 soon after its release onto the market.  Family Estate  The 2006 Lafite is the estate’s third cheapest in the past
15 years, ahead only of the most recent 2011 and 2012 vintages,
according to merchant data compiled by Liv-ex. It was rated 97
on a 100-point scale by U.S. critic Robert Parker in a February
2009 online tasting note, putting it above the 96+ points he
awarded to Lafite’s higher-priced 2005 vintage.  Parker said in the note that the selection process, in
which he reported that only 42 percent of grapes were used for
the flagship Lafite brand, “resulted in a full-bodied wine
boasting an extraordinary perfume of charcoal, truffles, lead
pencil shavings and sensationally sweet, ripe black currant and
cedar notes.” He predicted it would age for three decades.  Chateau Lafite-Rothschild has more than 100 hectares (247
acres) planted with red-grape vines. Cabernet Sauvignon
typically makes up from 80 percent to 95 percent of its wine,
with Merlot from 5 percent to 20 percent, and smaller quantities
of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.  The vineyards, owned by  Domaines Barons de Rothschild
(Lafite) , date back at least to the 17th century and the estate
has been under the control of the Rothschild family since being
acquired by Baron James de Rothschild, then head of its French
branch, in August 1868.  To contact the reporter on this story:
