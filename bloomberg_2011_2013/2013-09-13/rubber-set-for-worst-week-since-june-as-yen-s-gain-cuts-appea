Rubber dropped for a second day,
heading for the worst weekly loss since June, as the Japanese
currency strengthened to near a one-week high against the
dollar, reducing the appeal of the yen-based contracts.  Futures for February delivery on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange fell as much as 2.3 percent to 271.6 yen a kilogram
($2,721 a metric ton), the lowest since Sept. 2, and was at
272.8 yen at 10:42 a.m. local time. Prices lost 3.5 percent this
week, the biggest drop since the five days through June 14.  The yen appreciated to 99.02 a dollar yesterday, the
strongest since Sept. 6, ahead of a decision likely on Oct. 1 on
tax changes in world’s third-largest economy that raised demand
for the currency as a haven.  “Futures retreated as they lost support from the currency
market,” said  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at broker Fujitomi Co.
in Tokyo. “Prospects for the  Federal Reserve  to taper stimulus
also put a drag on the market.”  The Fed will decide to cut its $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases this month, according to 65 percent of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg from Aug. 9-13. The  Federal Open Market
Committee  holds a two-day meeting on Sept. 17-18.  The contract for January delivery in Shanghai fell for a
second day, losing 0.3 percent to 20,175  yuan  ($3,297) a ton.
 Thai rubber  free-on-board declined 1.7 percent to 84.65 baht
($2.67) a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
