Gold and silver futures posted the
biggest weekly drops since June on speculation that the  Federal
Reserve  will cut fiscal stimulus next week, while talks started
on a plan for  Syria  to surrender its chemical weapons.  The Fed will decide to cut monthly purchases of Treasuries
to $35 billion from $45 billion and keep mortgage-bond buying at
$40 billion at its meeting starting Sept. 17, a Bloomberg survey
showed. Gold reached a three-month high on Aug. 28 on concern
that the U.S. would attack Syria.  “The market has been fixated on what the central bank will
announce at the conclusion of their meeting,” Peter Hug, the
global trading director of Kitco Metals Inc., in  Montreal , said
in a report. “The perceived decreasing odds of U.S. military
action against the Syrian regime continue to pressure safe-haven
gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 1.7 percent to
settle at $1,308.60 at 1:56 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Earlier, the price touched $1,304.60, the lowest for a most-active contract since Aug. 9. This week, the metal dropped 5.6
percent, the biggest decline since June 21.  The price has fallen 22 percent this year as some investors
lost faith in the metal as a store of value amid a U.S. equity
rally and low inflation. Gold rose 70 percent from December 2008
to June 2011 as the Fed pumped more than $2 trillion into the
financial system by purchasing debt.  Goldman Outlook  Futures are poised to extend declines as the Fed reduces
stimulus and the economy gains, according to Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. The metal may drop below $1,000, beneath the bank’s 2014
target of $1,050,  Jeffrey Currie , the head of commodities
research, said today in a Bloomberg Television interview.  Silver futures for December delivery fell 1.9 percent to
$21.72 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, the price touched $21.42,
the lowest since Aug. 14. This week, the price tumbled 9.1
percent, the most since June 21.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery gained 0.1 percent to $1,444.50 an ounce. This
week, the price dropped 3.4 percent, the most since June 21.  Palladium futures for December delivery rose 0.9 percent to
$699.10 an ounce. The metal climbed 0.3 percent this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
