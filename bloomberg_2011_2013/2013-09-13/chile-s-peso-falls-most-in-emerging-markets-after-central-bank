Chile’s peso posted the biggest
drop among major emerging-market currencies as the central bank
signaled it may cut borrowing costs in coming months.  The currency depreciated 0.8 percent to 505.77 per  U.S.
dollar  today, the biggest decline since Aug. 19. The peso
snapped three straight days of advances and pared its gain this
week to 0.3 percent. The currency rose yesterday to 501.56, the
strongest level since July 18.  “The central bank didn’t really give the green light” for
the peso to gain further, Katia Diaz, a Latin America economist
at 4Cast Inc., said by phone from  New York . The move is also
being “exaggerated” by traders adjusting their positions
before holidays that will close Chilean markets next week amid
speculation the  Federal Reserve  may announce a reduction in
monetary stimulus on Sept. 18.  Policy makers held the target lending rate yesterday at 5
percent for a 20th straight meeting, matching the forecasts of
15 of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Four projected a
reduction to 4.75 percent. Last week, the central bank reduced
its 2013 economic growth estimate to a range of 4 percent to 4.5
percent from 4 percent to 5 percent.  “The consolidation of the trends outlined in the last
Monetary Policy Report could call for adjustments to the
monetary policy interest rate in the coming months,” according
to the statement released yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
