Corn fell for a second day after
the U.S. Department of Agriculture raised its outlook for the
domestic harvest. Soybeans and wheat also dropped.  U.S. farmers will collect 13.843 billion bushels of corn in
2013, the most ever and up from 13.763 billion estimated last
month, government figures showed yesterday. Domestic output will
rise 28 percent from last year’s drought-reduced harvest,
helping send global inventories to a 12-year high. Prices
tumbled 34 percent this year.  “Harvest data from private sources support ideas of good
corn production this year as yields have generally come in at or
above farmer and trade expectations,”  Jack Scoville , a vice
president for Price Futures Group in  Chicago , said in an e-mailed report. “World data showed that there will be plenty of
corn available.”  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 1.6 percent to
close at $4.59 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after falling 1.3 percent yesterday. Prices declined for
a second straight week.  Soybean futures for delivery in November fell 1 percent to
$13.815 a bushel on the CBOT. The loss pared this week’s gain to
1 percent, the sixth straight and the longest advance since June
2009.  Areas of the Midwest, including the top U.S. growers Iowa
and  Illinois , may get as much as 1.7 inches (4.3 centimeters) of
rain the next seven days, aiding the filling of soybean pods
with bigger beans, National Weather Service  data  show.  Oilseed Outlook  Global production of oilseeds including soybeans, canola
and sunflower seeds this year is expected to rise 4.8 percent to
495.1 million metric tons from 472.6 a year earlier, boosting
global inventories 17 percent before next year’s harvest, the
USDA said yesterday.  “The Midwest rains should halt the decline in U.S. soybean
production and may add a few bushels in some fields,”  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment
Co. in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview. “The world
supply of oilseeds is going to be huge.”  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 1.8 percent to
$6.415 a bushel, capping a second weekly decline.  The USDA raised its estimate for global production 0.5
percent from last month to a record 708.89 million metric tons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
