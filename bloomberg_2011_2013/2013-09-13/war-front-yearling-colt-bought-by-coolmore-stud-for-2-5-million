A dark bay War Front colt sold for
$2.5 million to top the prices paid for 546 horses sold during
the first four days at the Keeneland September Yearling Sale.  Gross sales through yesterday reached almost $153.4 million,
according to  Keeneland Association Inc.  in Lexington,  Kentucky .  Eighteen horses sold for at least $1 million, the most
seven-figure yearlings since the 2008 sale, when 18 sold for $1
million or more, the association said.  “This is the cream of  North America ’s yearling crop,”
director of sales Geoffrey Russell said in a statement.  M.V. Magnier of Ireland-based Coolmore Stud bought the War
Front colt, which had been purchased as a weanling for $180,000
by Peter O’Callaghan of Woods Edge Farm in Lexington, Kentucky.  “Very nice horse,” said Magnier, the session’s leading
buyer with the single purchase. “He was a good mover with nice
legs. We’ve been lucky with War Front. This is a good-looking
horse for us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
