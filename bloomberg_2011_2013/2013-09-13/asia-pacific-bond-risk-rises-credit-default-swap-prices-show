The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment increased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 2.5 basis points to
114.5 basis points as of 9:35 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. That pares its decline this week to 3.5
basis points, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed 2 basis points to 140 as of 8:18
a.m. in Hong Kong, Westpac prices show. The benchmark is on
track to slide 5.7 basis points this week, according to CMA,
which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index gained 1 basis point to 86 as
of 9:07 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The gauge
has fallen 4.7 basis points since Sept. 6, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
