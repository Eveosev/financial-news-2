Rigs targeting oil and natural gas
in the U.S. rose by one this week to 1,768, according to  Baker
Hughes Inc. (BHI)   Oil rigs  fell by four to 1,361, data posted on the
company’s website show. The  gas  count rose seven to 401, the
Houston-based field services company said.  The  U.S. rig count  has fallen by 96 rigs compared to the
same time last year even as U.S. production and  oil prices  have
surged, as drilling efficiency has increased well yields in
shale basins like the Bakken. The number of  directional wells ,
which enable drilling at multiple angles, has risen to 248 from
207 a year ago. The gain in oil output helped the U.S. meet 87
percent of its energy needs in the first five months of 2013, on
pace to be the highest annual rate since 1986, according to the
Energy Information Administration.  Regulatory permits for onshore drilling are rising,
according to  Barclays Plc. (BARC)  James C. West, an oil-services
analyst for the  New York  investment bank, said those permits
reached their highest level this year in August, up 14 percent
from July to 5,231 issued in 30 states the research team
monitors. An increase in permits tends to precede an increase in
well drilling by two months, West said in a Sept. 11 research
note.  West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery fell 73
cents to $107.87 a barrel at 1:07 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , up 9.7 percent in the past year.  U.S. oil output gained 124,000 barrels a day to 7.75
million in the week ended Sept. 6, the highest level since May
1989, according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical
arm.  Natural gas for October delivery rose 3.1 cents to $3.669
per million British thermal units on the Nymex, up 21 percent
from a year ago.  U.S. gas stockpiles  rose 65 billion cubic feet last week to
3.253 trillion cubic feet, the EIA said yesterday. Supplies were
5 percent below a year earlier and 1.4 percent above the five-year average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
