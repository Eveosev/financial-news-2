Asian currencies had their best
week in two months, led by India’s rupee, after U.S. jobs data
tempered speculation the  Federal Reserve  will cut stimulus
that’s buoyed  emerging markets .  Payrolls in the world’s largest economy climbed less than
economists projected in August and gains for the previous two
months were revised down, a Sept. 6 report showed, ahead of a
Fed meeting that will discuss the $85 billion monthly debt-purchase program. President  Barack Obama  has delayed a decision
on military strikes against Syria to pursue a Russian offer to
get the regime to give up its chemical weapons.  “The weaker-than-expected payrolls number took the heat
out of expectations around next week’s Fed meeting, and even if
tapering is announced, it’s expected to be quite modest,” said
 Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist at  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  in Singapore. “At the same time, the Syrian situation has
calmed down.”  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index rose 0.5 percent
this week, the most since the period ended July 12, to 115.26
yesterday. The rupee rallied 2.8 percent to 63.4950 per dollar,
according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg.
Thailand’s baht rose 1.2 percent to 31.850, the  Philippine peso 
gained 1.4 percent to 43.87 and Malaysia’s ringgit appreciated
1.2 percent to 3.29.  Global funds pumped $5.7 billion into the stock markets of
India, Indonesia, the Philippines,  South Korea , Taiwan and
Thailand this week, according to exchange data.  Brent crude 
declined 2.9 percent since Sept. 6 as concern the U.S. would
strike Syria eased.  Improving Sentiment  “Risk sentiment is improving from its bottom and that was
positive for emerging markets in general,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist covering developing markets at Dai-ichi
Life Research Institute Inc. in Tokyo. “Countries with strong
or better economic fundamentals are benefiting the most.”  U.S. policy makers are set to meet Sept. 17-18 to review
policy. The Fed will probably start tapering bond buying in
September, according to 65 percent of economists in an Aug. 9-13
survey by Bloomberg. Employers in the world’s largest economy
added 169,000 workers last month, less than the median forecast
of economists of 180,000, last week’s report showed.  The rupee, which touched a record low of 68.845 per dollar
on Aug. 28, completed its best week since October 2009 after
 Reserve Bank  of India Governor Raghuram Rajan, who took office
on Sept. 4, announced plans to strengthen the financial industry
and boost dollar supply. India’s  factory output  climbed 2.6
percent in July from a year earlier after a revised 1.8 percent
decline in June, a report showed Sept. 12.  Baht, Peso  The baht had its biggest weekly gain in five months after
global funds increased holdings of the nation’s assets. Overseas
investors pumped a net $381 million into Thai debt this week
through Sept. 12, according to the Thai Bond Market Association.  The peso posted its largest five-day rally since June 2012
after the central bank held its benchmark rate at a record low
of 3.5 percent on Sept. 12. Inflation in Southeast Asia’s
fastest-growing major economy eased to a four-year low in
August.  Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea’s won strengthened 0.6
percent this week to 1,086.88 and China’s  yuan  was little
changed at 6.1188. Indonesia’s rupiah dropped for a fifth week,
falling 2.1 percent to 11,410 and Vietnam’s dong climbed 0.2
percent to 21,115. In Taipei, where markets are open today, the
local dollar climbed 0.5 percent for the week and 0.4 percent
for the day to NT$29.739 per greenback as of 9:38 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
