Aer Lingus Group Plc (AERL)  fell the most
in more than four years in Dublin trading after the Irish
carrier cut its full-year profit forecast after the summer heat
wave weighed on bookings.  Aer Lingus fell as much as 19 cents, or 12 percent, to 1.39
euros, and traded at 1.49 euros as of 9:23 a.m. The stock has
gained 35 percent this year.  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) , the carrier’s
 largest shareholder , dropped as much as 1.8 percent.  The company said this year’s operating profit before one-time items will be about 60 million euros ($80 million),
compared with a target of matching last year’s 69.1 million
euros, according to a statement today.  “The current booking profile for the rest of the year
suggests that despite more aggressive pricing in response to
market conditions, it will not be possible to recover lost
volumes experienced in July and August as a result of the warm
weather,” Aer Lingus said. “In addition, the intensely
competitive pricing environment will continue to impact higher
yielding in-month bookings.”  The revision comes after Ryanair said Sept. 4 that it may
miss its annual profit target. Aer Berlin Plc said Aug. 15 the
warm weather in northern  Europe  slowed bookings and made meeting
the full-year profit target more difficult.  Aer Lingus said it would look for further cost reductions
“in order to preserve competitiveness and protect future
profitability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
