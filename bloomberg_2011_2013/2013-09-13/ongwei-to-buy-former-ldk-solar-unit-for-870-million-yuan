Tongwei Group, a Chinese
polysilicon producer, agreed to purchase a former unit of LDK
Solar Co. for 870 million  yuan  ($142 million) to expand into
solar-cell and module manufacturing.  Tongwei, whose polysilicon is used to make solar cells,
will buy LDK Solar Hi-Tech (Hefei) Co. from an affiliate of the
Hefei government in China’s Anhui province, according to a Sept.
11  statement  published by the government’s bidding center.
Tongwei’s press office couldn’t be reached today after normal
business hours.  The purchase, at seven times the price LDK got for the unit
this year, will enable Tongwei to produce solar cells using its
own polysilicon. While that gives it a cost advantage over some
competitors, its biggest rival  GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800) 
already manufactures solar wafers with its own raw material.  LDK sold the unit in April to Hefei High Tech Industrial
Development Social Service Corp. to reduce debt after a decline
in solar-panel prices erased earnings. Xinyu, China-based LDK
said Sept. 4 it was in talks with bondholders to delay $13
million of interest payments that were due Aug. 28. It’s hired
Jefferies Group LLC to advise on its offshore debt obligations.  Tongwei is also  China ’s biggest producer of aquatic feed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
