London police arrested 12 men over
an attempt to hack into  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  computers, preventing
a theft potentially worth millions of pounds.  The arrests relate to a device that was found on a computer
in an East London Santander branch that would have allowed a
remote user to access and take control of its systems, the
 Metropolitan Police Service  said in a statement today.  “This was a sophisticated plot that could have led to the
loss of a very large amount of money from the bank, and is the
most significant case of this kind that we have come across,”
Detective Inspector Mark Raymond said.  Banks face cyber-security threats from increasingly
sophisticated hackers trying to steal customer identities or
access funds. Andy Haldane,  executive director  for financial
stability at the  Bank of England , told lawmakers in June that
regulators should “take a close look at the state of
preparedness” of major banks to protect against cyber-attacks.  The attempt failed and no money was put at risk, Andy
Smith, a spokesman for Santander U.K., said in an e-mail. The
device was installed by a bogus engineer and no bank staff were
involved, he said.  The suspects are between the ages of 23 and 50, according
to the police. Officers raided homes in the London neighborhoods
of Westminster, Hounslow, Hillingdon, Brent and Richmond and
seized property in Slough, a city west of the British capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
