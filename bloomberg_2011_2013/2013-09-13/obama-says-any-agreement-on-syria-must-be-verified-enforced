President  Barack Obama  said any
agreement on Syria surrendering its chemical weapons must be
“verifiable and enforceable,” adding that the civil war only
will end with a political settlement.  Obama, speaking at the conclusion of a White House meeting
with Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, the emir of Kuwait, said he
hopes that the negotiations now going on between U.S. and Russia
in Geneva will result in a plan for the next steps in Syria.  The emir said he and Obama discussed “the harsh suffering
of the Syrian people” and the importance of a coordinated
effort to prevent a war in the region.  Neither leader answered any questions.  In Geneva, U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  reported a
“constructive” start to his talks with Russian Foreign
Minister  Sergei Lavrov .  To contact the reporter on this story:
