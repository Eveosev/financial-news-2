Palm oil  capped the first weekly
decline in five on speculation that increasing output in top
growers  Indonesia  and Malaysia will boost stockpiles.  Palm for November delivery closed little changed at 2,347
ringgit ($713) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives.
Futures dropped 4 percent this week, the most since the five
days ended March 29. Palm for physical delivery in September was
at 2,370 ringgit, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Prices may extend their decline as supplies of the most-used cooking oil climb and biodiesel demand peaks, according to
Dorab Mistry, director at Godrej International Ltd. Palm, used
in everything from candy to biofuel, is produced year-round with
supply accelerating in the second half because of growing cycles.  “These are typically the higher production months, so the
question is whether exports can keep up the pace so that
inventories will remain in check,” said James Ratnam, an
analyst at TA Securities Holdings Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur .  Output in Malaysia gained 3.6 percent to 1.74 million tons
in August from July, the highest level since December, while
exports climbed 7.4 percent to 1.52 million tons, according to
the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. In Indonesia, production rose 0.8
percent to 2.4 million tons in July, also the highest since
December, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Inventories in Malaysia were 1.67 million tons in August,
little changed from July, board data shows. Indonesian reserves
were estimated at 2.35 million tons in July.  Soybeans for November gained 0.2 percent to $13.9875 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil  for December
delivery fell 0.4 percent to 42.88 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for January delivery declined 0.5 percent
to close at 5,470  yuan  ($894) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange . Soybean oil ended little changed at 7,196 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
