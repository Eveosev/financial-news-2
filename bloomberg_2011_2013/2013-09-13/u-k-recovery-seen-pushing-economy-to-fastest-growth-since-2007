The U.K. economy is heading for its fastest expansion since the onset of the financial crisis, economists said as they upgraded their forecasts for growth through 2015.  Gross domestic product  will rise 1.3 percent this year and 2 percent in 2014, compared with predictions of 1 percent and 1.7 percent previously, according to the median of 48 economists in a monthly survey by  Bloomberg News . That pace of growth for next year would be the fastest since 2007, before the start of a slump that has left output more than 3 percent below its peak.  For Bank of England Governor  Mark Carney , the question is how quickly this recovery can lower the country’s  unemployment rate  after he introduced forward guidance last month and linked the jobless rate directly to the policy stance. That measure hasn’t yet been effective, according to more than two thirds of economists in a separate survey.  “The consensus forecast has moved a long way very, very quickly,” said  Jens Larsen , an economist at  RBC Capital Markets  in London and a former BOE official. “If you get a very powerful recovery, the arguments for guidance, for the extended period of low rates, just look so much weaker. It’s a bit of a communication challenge.”  The economists in the Bloomberg survey see GDP growth accelerating to 2.4 percent in 2015.  Consumer spending  will rise 1.6 percent this year and in 2014, while exports will increase 1.8 percent and 4.7 percent.  Guidance Framework  Under its so-called forward guidance, the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee has said it won’t consider raising the  benchmark interest rate  from a record-low 0.5 percent until unemployment falls to 7 percent, which they don’t see happening until late 2016.  That projection is being challenged by recent data, and economists are more optimistic, with 19 of 31 forecasting that it will fall below the threshold before 2016.  Data this week showed the  unemployment  rate fell to 7.7 percent in the three months through July from 7.8 percent in the second quarter. The labor-market report also showed that  jobless claims  in the past two months have fallen by the most since 1997.  Government figures today showed construction output, which accounts for 6.3 percent of the economy, climbed 2.2 percent in July. In the second quarter, new building orders surged almost 20 percent from the previous three months, boosted by demand for homes as well as  wind turbines  and solar farms. Overall housing orders between April and June were the strongest since the fourth quarter of 2007.  Difference of Opinion  BOE policy makers say productivity will pick up as the economy recovers, meaning companies will get more output from their existing workers, which will limit the pace of hiring. Carney said yesterday that a difference of opinion between the central bank and other forecasters is “natural.”  “The market had a more positive view of the rate at which unemployment will come down and a more pessimistic view of productivity,” he said at a hearing of the Treasury Committee, a panel of lawmakers that scrutinizes the BOE.  Economists’ more positive outlook for the U.K. follows  economic growth  of 0.7 percent in the three months through June as well as a continued strengthening of services and manufacturing this quarter.  Property Boom  Recent signs of recovery have also boosted confidence in the housing market. A report by Acadametrics Ltd. today showed  house prices  rose to a record last month as government measures boosted demand and London’s property market continued to surge.  The  Royal Institution  of Chartered Surveyors today called for the central bank’s Financial Policy Committee to limit annual property price increases to 5 percent to prevent another bubble.  Even after recent improvements in the economy, two thirds of economists in the Bloomberg survey said the economy is still not at what Carney has termed “escape velocity.” The survey was conducted from Sept. 6 to Sept. 11.  In tandem with the pickup, gilt yields have risen and investors have increased bets on an  interest-rate  increase before 2016. Twenty-three of 33 economists surveyed by Bloomberg said guidance hasn’t yet been effective.  “There is a risk that households, businesses and financial market participants overreact to signs of a recovery,” BOE Chief Economist  Spencer Dale  wrote in a co-authored  article  with the central bank’s James Talbot published on the VoxEU.org website today. “Forward guidance provides a robust framework within which the MPC can explore the scope for economic expansion without putting either  price stability  or financial stability at risk.”  Transparency Challenge  For  Ross Walker , an economist at  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , Carney’s testimony to lawmakers yesterday failed to provide the clarity required.  “For a policy framework designed to bring greater transparency and enhance understanding of the MPC’s reaction function, a distinct sense of haziness pervaded the hearing,” he said. “The BOE’s core problem remains that it is difficult to provide greater transparency via forward guidance when there is a divided -- seemingly increasingly divided -- MPC.”  Philip Rush, an economist at Nomura International Plc, said policy makers testifying along with Carney showed little “pushback” against market predictions of an earlier rate increase. “Some comments suggested that the extent of the market move might be overdone, but intent to change those expectations appeared absent,” he said.  Carney has said his message is aimed at consumers and executives as much as investors, as they are the ones who will ultimately drive the economy.  “It needs to be supplemented by the common understanding of policy, not just in financial markets, but by businesses and households,” he said yesterday. “A given stance of policy that is better understood by people who make spending and investment decisions in the economy is more effective.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Fergal O’Brien in Dublin at  fobrien@bloomberg.net ; Joshua Robinson in  London  at  jrobinson37@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Craig Stirling at  cstirling1@bloomberg.net
