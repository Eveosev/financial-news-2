U.S.  stocks  rose for the week,
sending the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  rallying the most since
January, as concerns over  Syria  and possible cuts to central
bank stimulus abated and  China’s economy  strengthened.  Walt Disney Co. jumped 8.6 percent on share buyback plans.
Verizon Communications Inc. climbed 3.1 percent as the phone
carrier sold $49 billion of bonds in the biggest corporate debt
offering ever. Visa Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Nike Inc.
rose at least 4.5 percent after being picked to join the Dow.
Apple Inc. tumbled 6.7 percent as its new iPhones failed to
soothe investor concern over slowing growth.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 2 percent to
1,687.99 for the week, the biggest increase since July 12. The
Dow advanced 453.56 points, or 3 percent, to 15,376.06, capping
the second-best week this year.  “We’ve been given a reprieve on the Syrian issue and
that’s allowed the market to focus on the data and to focus on
the Fed meeting next week,”  Quincy Krosby , a market strategist
for  Newark , New Jersey-based Prudential Financial Inc., which
oversees more than $1 trillion, said by phone. Reports from
 China  have “helped underpin a pickup in confidence that the
global economy is beginning overall to march higher.”  Equities rose amid signs tensions over Syria are easing,
with officials from the U.S. and  Russia  negotiating in Geneva
for an agreement on Syria surrendering its chemical weapons.
President  Barack Obama  had said he would ask Congress to
authorize the use of military force against President Bashar al-Assad’s regime following a suspected chemical-weapons attack on
Aug. 21 that the U.S. says killed more than 1,400 people.  China’s Economy  Better-than-forecast data on Chinese exports, industrial
output and retail sales bolstered optimism that the world’s
second-largest economy is gaining momentum after the slowest
pace in 13 years in 2012.  In the U.S., reports showed retail sales rose less than
forecast in August while  consumer confidence  declined this month
to the lowest level since April, indicating household spending
may take time to pick up.  Given the weakness in recent economic data, “the market is
discounting a token taper,” Krosby said. “The assumption is
that if the Fed introduces the taper, it’ll be mild and the
guidance will be more dovish than hawkish.”  Fed Meeting  The Fed will reduce its $85 billion in monthly bond buying
by $10 billion to $75 billion after its Sept. 17-18 meeting,
according to the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. Three rounds of central bank stimulus helped push
the  S&P 500  as much as 153 percent higher from its March 2009
low.  While concern over reduced stimulus contributed to a
retreat of as much as 4.6 percent in the S&P 500 from its August
record, investors now see the anticipated cut in bond purchases
will be no big deal if it goes ahead next week, according to a
Bloomberg Global Poll.  Fifty-seven percent of those surveyed say they don’t expect
a sudden change in the markets on any tapering action. Eight
percent see a rally on such news, while just under a third are
looking for declines, based on the Sept. 10 poll of 900
investors, traders and analysts who are Bloomberg subscribers.  Options traders scaled back hedges against potential stock
losses. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or
 VIX (VIX) , dropped 11 percent to 14.16 for the week, the most since
July 5. The equity volatility gauge has fallen 21 percent this
year while the S&P 500 is up 18 percent.  Industry Returns  All 10 S&P 500 main  industries  rallied as industrial,
consumer-discretionary and raw-materials companies rose the
most, climbing more than 2.6 percent. The Nasdaq Composite Index
advanced 1.7 percent, reaching a 13-year high on Sept. 10.  Disney surged 8.6 percent to $66.69. The world’s biggest
entertainment company plans to buy back $6 billion to $8 billion
of stock starting next year, stepping up efforts to increase
investor returns as capital spending winds down.  Verizon advanced 3.1 percent to $47.76. The second-biggest
U.S. telephone carrier sold bonds with maturities ranging from
three to 30 years to help fund its buyout of partner Vodafone
Group Plc.’s 45 percent stake in the largest and most profitable
U.S. wireless carrier,  Verizon (VZ)  Wireless.  Index Reshuffle  Visa, the largest payment network, climbed 7 percent to
$189 and Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest  U.S. bank  by assets,
advanced 4.7 percent to $164. Nike, the world’s largest maker of
sporting goods, rose 4.5 percent to $67.91.  The three companies will be added to the Dow after the
close on Sept. 20, replacing Bank of America Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Alcoa Inc. in the biggest  reshuffling  since
April 2004. Bank of America added 0.9 percent to $14.49.
Hewlett-Packard slipped 1.6 percent to $22.07. Alcoa gained 2
percent to $8.08.  Delta Air (DAL)  Lines Inc. jumped 13 percent to $22.47. The
world’s second-largest carrier joined the S&P 500 after reducing
debt and restarting dividend payments and a stock buyback in its
comeback from bankruptcy.  International Business Machines Corp. rallied 5 percent to
$192.17. The world’s largest computer-services provider agreed
to sell its customer-care outsourcing business to Synnex Corp.
for $505 million to focus on more profitable investments.  Molex (MOLX)  Inc. soared 32 percent, the most in the S&P 500, to
$38.65. The maker of electronic components for products such as
Apple’s iPhone agreed to be bought for $7.2 billion by Koch
Industries Inc., the holding company controlled by the
billionaire Koch brothers.  Apple Drops  Apple slumped 6.7 percent to $464.90 for the worst weekly
decline since April. The company unveiled two iPhones that were
criticized by analysts as lacking enough new features or a
sufficiently low price to attract a broad range of new
customers. The stock has dropped 13 percent this year amid
concern increasing competition and a lack of breakthrough
products will hurt profit.  Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN)  plunged 9.8 percent to $38.38 for the
biggest retreat in the S&P 500. The teen-clothing retailer said
third-quarter comparable-store  sales  have been rising at a
“mid-single-digit” rate. That missed an estimate for a “high-single digit” rate by Janney Montgomery Scott LLC.  Newmont Mining Corp., the largest U.S. gold producer,
dropped 7.3 percent to $28.20 as the precious metal posted the
biggest weekly decline since June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
