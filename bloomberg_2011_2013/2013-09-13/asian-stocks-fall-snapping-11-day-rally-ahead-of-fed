Asian  stocks  fell, with the
regional benchmark index snapping an 11-day rally, as the U.S.
and Russia hold talks on Syria and investors await the outcome
of a  Federal Reserve  meeting next week.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the biggest mining company, slipped 1
percent in Sydney as metal futures headed for a weekly decline.
Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd., which has the world’s largest merchant
shipping fleet, fell 3.5 percent after a gauge of  freight rates 
halted an eight-day rally. Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd., the
world’s No. 2 developer by market value, dropped 1.4 percent in
 Hong Kong  after setting a lower sales target this year.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.6 percent to 136.90 as
of 5:17 p.m. in  Tokyo , halting its longest stretch of gains this
year, as three shares fell for every two that rose. The gauge is
poised for a 2.3 percent gain this week. The measure’s 14-day
relative strength index, an indicator of trading momentum,
climbed to 67 yesterday, near a threshold of 70 that signals to
some analysts shares may have risen too far.  “Investors paused for thought in the wake of the market’s
recent strong run,” Matthew Sherwood, who helps oversee about
$25 billion as head of markets research in Sydney at Perpetual
Investments, said in an e-mail. “The global economic rebound
still remains fragile and below trend, and earnings growth
forecasts are extremely optimistic for this environment.”  Euro-area industrial output fell more than analysts
estimated in July as the region struggled with high
unemployment. Australia’s jobless rate last month reached a
four-year high, while claims for  unemployment benefits  in the
U.S. last week fell.  Japan ’s industrial output increased 1.8
percent in July from a year earlier, faster than a preliminary
estimate of 1.6 percent, the government reported today.  Regional Gauges  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies
traded in Hong Kong declined 0.9 percent. The so-called H-share
index climbed 20 percent from a June 25 low earlier this week,
entering what some investors consider a  bull market , amid signs
 China’s economy  is improving. China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) 
slipped 0.9 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 0.2
percent today.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.4 percent and South
Korea’s Kospi index both dropped 0.5 percent. Taiwan’s Taiex
index slid 0.7 percent and  Singapore ’s Straits Times Index was
little changed. Japan’s Topix index added 0.1 percent, erasing
losses of as much as 0.8 percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
rose 0.2 percent.  Best Performer  The  Topix (TPX)  has advanced 7.2 percent this month amid optimism
about Tokyo hosting the 2020 Summer Games, taking its gains for
the year to 38 percent, the best among developed markets tracked
by Bloomberg.  Japan is considering a reduction in corporate-income taxes
as part of a stimulus package to cushion the economy from the
planned increase in the sales levy, according to three people
briefed on the matter.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.1
percent. The gauge fell 0.3 percent yesterday in New York,
snapping the longest streak of gains since July.  U.S. jobless claims declined last week to 292,000, the
fewest since April 2006, as upgrades to computer systems in two
states caused employment agencies to report fewer applications.
An agency spokesman said the upgrades played a major role in the
drop in claims. Economists were expecting an increase to 330,000
from 323,000 in the previous week.  Fed Stimulus  The U.S. central bank has said any reduction in stimulus
will be tied to a sustained recovery in employment. The Federal
Reserve will decide to cut its $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases when it meets Sept. 17-18, according to 65 percent of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg last month.  U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  is in Geneva to meet
with Russian counterpart  Sergei Lavrov  over a deal for the
removal of Syria’s chemical weapons. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said any deal to surrender the nation’s chemical arsenal
must be a “two-way street” in which the administration of
President  Barack Obama  drops its military threats and stops
arming Syrian rebels.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 6.4 percent this year
through yesterday. Shares on the Asia-Pacific gauge traded at
13.4 times estimated earnings, compared with 15.2 times for the
S&P 500 and 14.2 for Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  All but one of the 10  industries  in the Asia-Pacific gauge
declined, led by raw-material producers, as copper, gold and oil
futures headed for weekly losses of more than 1 percent.  BHP, Newcrest  BHP Billiton  fell 1 percent to A$36.20.  Newcrest Mining
Ltd. (NCM) , Australia’s biggest gold producer, dropped 1.7 percent to
A$12.02. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s largest producer of the
metal, sank 4.2 percent to HK$16 in Hong Kong. Inpex Corp.,
Japan’s top energy explorer, slipped 1.4 percent to 455,000 yen.  Shipping companies retreated after the  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) ,
which measures the cost of transporting commodities from copper
to corn, fell for the first time in nine days yesterday in
London.  Mitsui OSK dropped 3.5 percent to 445 yen in Tokyo. China
Shipping Development Co., which transports oil and coal, slumped
6.5 percent to HK$4.45 in Hong Kong.  Pacific Basin Shipping
Ltd. (2343) , Hong Kong’s biggest bulk carrier, dropped 3.5 percent to
HK$5.17.  Sun Hung Kai Properties decreased 1.4 percent to HK$101.70.
The builder plans to sell HK$28 billion ($3.6 billion) of homes
in Hong Kong and mainland China in the year through June 2014,
Deputy Managing Director Victor Lui said at a briefing in the
city yesterday. That compares with home sales of HK$32.9 billion
a year earlier.  Share Sale  Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (981)  slid 3.5
percent to 55 Hong Kong cents. Investors are seeking to raise as
much as $40 million, selling the chipmaker’s shares at 53 to 55
Hong Hong cents each, according to a term sheet obtained by
Bloomberg.  Manila Water Co., the Philippine utility company partly
owned by Ayala Corp., tumbled 15 percent to 26.50 pesos after
the government rejected petitions to increase rates and ordered
a cut in tariffs. Metro Pacific Investments Corp., owner
Maynilad Water Services Inc., slid 6.4 percent to 4.40 pesos.
Ayala Corp. lost 0.9 percent to 558 pesos.  To contact the reporters on this story:
