Aleo Solar AG (AS1) , the German solar-panel producer owned by car-parts maker Robert Bosch GmbH, will
withdraw from the U.S. because it’s losing money there.  Aleo Solar decided to dissolve its Aleo Solar North America
unit in Denver after it “failed to meet recent sales targets
and was not operating profitably,” the company said today in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
