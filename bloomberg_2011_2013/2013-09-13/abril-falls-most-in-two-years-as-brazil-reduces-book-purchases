Abril Educacao SA (ABRE11) , the education
unit of  Brazil ’s Grupo Abril, slumped the most in two years as
the government reduced purchases of textbooks from the company’s
publishing houses.  The  shares  tumbled 7.5 percent to 31.75 reais at 1:06 p.m.
in Sao Paulo, the worst performance on the BM&FBovespa Small Cap
Index, which slid 0.1 percent. Earlier today they lost 8.4
percent, the steepest intraday drop since August 2011.  Brazil’s federal government will buy 30 million textbooks
from Abril for public-school students in 2014, the company said
in a regulatory filing yesterday after the market closed. That
compares with 44.8 million books this year, according to a
 statement  on Abril’s website.  “We see the announcement as negative, as it adds
uncertainty to a business that was seen by investors as
defensive,” Joao Carlos Santos and Pedro Montenegro, analysts
at Grupo BTG Pactual, wrote yesterday in a research note.  The investment bank cut its estimates for Abril’s earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2013 by
6.5 percent to 303 million reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
