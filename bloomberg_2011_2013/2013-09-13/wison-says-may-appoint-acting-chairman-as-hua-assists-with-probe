Wison Engineering Services Co. said
it may appoint an acting chairman as its chief and controlling
shareholder Hua Bangsong continues to assist Chinese authorities
in a probe.  The company has also appointed Zhou Hongliang and Cui Ying
as executive directors, it said in a filing to the  Hong Kong 
Stock Exchange today. Wison is assisting Chinese authorities in
investigations, it said, without providing more information.  The petroleum engineering company said Sept. 3 its founder
Hua was helping authorities in unspecified investigations, a day
after its shares plunged 16 percent and were suspended from
trading.  China  is investigating  PetroChina Co. (857) ’s former Chairman
Jiang Jiemin and four senior executives for graft. The nation’s
biggest oil producer was Wison’s biggest customer before 2012,
bringing the relationship under scrutiny.  Wison’s revenue from contracts with PetroChina was around
111 million yuan ($18.1 million), or 5.6 percent of its revenue
in the first half of 2013, according to today’s statement.  Outstanding contracts with PetroChina amount to around 204
million  yuan , it said.  Wison didn’t say when its shares will resume trading,
adding it will make further announcements when appropriate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
