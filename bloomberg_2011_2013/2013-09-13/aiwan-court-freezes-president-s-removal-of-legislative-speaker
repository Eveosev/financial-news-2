Taiwanese legislative speaker Wang Jin-pyng will remain a member of President Ma Ying-jeou’s ruling
party after a court halted a bid to expel him, setting the stage
for a protracted dispute as Ma’s popularity is waning.  The Taipei District Court issued an injunction on Wang’s
removal from the Kuomintang party, preserving his leadership
position, Chiu Tai-san, one of his advisers, said by phone
today. The party will lodge an appeal next week, its lawyer  Chen
Ming  told reporters in a briefing carried on cable network TVBS.  The court’s decision raises the risk of the spat dragging
on as Ma battles a record-low approval rating, with four
cabinet-level officials resigning since July. The president had
pressed for Wang’s removal as he seeks to push his policy
agenda, which includes finishing a nuclear power plant and
lowering trade barriers with  China . A new legislative session is
due to begin on Sept. 17.  Wang, 72, had agreed to lawmaker demands for a detailed
review of the government’s trade pact with China, which lowers
barriers for services sectors such as banking and brokerages and
was signed in June. China Politburo member Yu Zhengsheng told
Taiwan negotiators the two sides should seal their economic
agreements soon, according to a report yesterday by the official
Xinhua News Agency.  The Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party, on Sept. 11 revoked
Wang’s party membership after telephone recordings showed he had
intervened in the prosecution of a lawmaker.  To contact the reporters on this story:
