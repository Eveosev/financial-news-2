Songbird Estates Plc (SBD) , the company
that controls London’s  Canary Wharf  district, reported higher
first-half net asset value and said interest from potential
tenants picked up.  Adjusted net asset value rose to 2.23 pounds per share as
of June 30 from 2.10 pounds at the end of last year, the London-based company said in a statement today. Rental income climbed
to 134.6 million pounds from 130.3 million pounds a year
earlier.  “The retail portfolio again performed strongly, increasing
in value by 6.7 percent in the period, reflecting a slight
hardening of yields, progress with the expansion of Jubilee
Place mall and growth in passing rents,” Chairman David Pritchard said in the statement. “Activity in the office
letting market is improving.”  Canary Wharf Group Plc, in which Songbird has a 69 percent
stake, has been broadening the types of buildings it builds and
expanding outside the financial district of the same name.
Leasing at Canary Wharf was “subdued” in the first half and
has improved since then, with tenants including  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  agreeing to rent about 100,000 square feet of space so
far this year, Pritchard said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
