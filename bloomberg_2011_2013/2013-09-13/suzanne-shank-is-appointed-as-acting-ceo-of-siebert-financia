Suzanne Shank will be acting chief
executive officer of  Siebert Financial Corp. (SIEB) , founded by the
late Muriel Siebert, the first woman to buy a seat on the New
York Stock Exchange.  Shank will continue as president and chief executive
officer of New York-based Siebert Brandford Shank & Co. LLC, the
company said in a statement. That firm, which shares a parent
company with Siebert Financial, has worked on more than $1
trillion of municipal transactions for state and local
governments since its inception in 1996.  “I am deeply honored to be named acting CEO of the Company
founded by  Wall Street  legend Muriel F. Siebert,” Shank said in
a statement. “Mickie was not only a trailblazer on Wall Street
but a wonderful partner, mentor and friend. Our partnership was
extremely successful as we shared a penchant for sound business
practices and integrity.”  Muriel Siebert in 1967 became the first woman to own a seat
on the  New York  Stock Exchange. She died Aug. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
