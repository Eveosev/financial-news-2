Chicago  must pay a Morgan Stanley-
led investment vehicle $58 million it won in arbitration over
the city’s violation of a 99-year lease of four parking garages
on the east side of its downtown.  Chicago Loop Parking LLC claimed the city breached the 2006
accord when it allowed a new building in its near east side
neighborhood, called the Aqua, to offer public parking.  State court Judge Sophia H. Hall in Chicago yesterday
rejected the city’s bid to alter the award rendered in February.
The city contended a May agreement with the Aqua’s owner to end
public parking there eliminated its liability for future
damages.  Hall, in a written ruling, said she had no authority to
change an arbitration award the city conceded was lawfully
rendered and that even if she had that power, she couldn’t do so
based on facts created after the arbitration proceedings ended.  The third-largest U.S. city, Chicago has a population of
almost 2.7 million people. Chicago Loop paid it $563 million for
the lease in 2006. It had demanded $200 million in damages for
the Aqua’s incursion when it filed for arbitration in 2011.  Roderick Drew, a spokesman for the city’s law department,
didn’t immediately reply to voice-mail message seeking comment
on Hall’s decision.  Scott Burnham, a spokesman for Chicago Loop, declined to
comment. He is affiliated with the Chicago-based public
relations firm Serafin & Associates.  The case is City of Chicago v. Chicago Loop Parking LLC,
13-CH-13381, Cook County,  Illinois , Circuit Court,  Chancery
Division  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
