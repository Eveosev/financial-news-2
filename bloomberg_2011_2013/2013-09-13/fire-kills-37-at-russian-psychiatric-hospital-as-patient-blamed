At least 37 people died in a fire
at a psychiatric hospital in northwestern  Russia  that
prosecutors said may have been started by a patient.  The  blaze , in a village in the Novgorod region, started
when 59 people were inside the facility, the local prosecutor’s
office said in an e-mailed statement. As many as 23 people were
evacuated. Witnesses said it appeared to have started on a
patient’s bed, according to the statement.  The fire was extinguished at 11:30 a.m., almost nine hours
after it started, and destroyed most of the building, Oleg
Voronov, a spokesman at the regional Emergency Ministry, said by
phone.  Inspectors in March 2012 found “numerous” violations at
the hospital that burned down today, requiring an overhaul of
the building, prosecutors said.  In April, 38 people died near Moscow in another fire at a
psychiatric hospital.  To contact the reporters on this story:
