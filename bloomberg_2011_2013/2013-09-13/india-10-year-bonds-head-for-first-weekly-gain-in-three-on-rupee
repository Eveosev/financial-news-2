India ’s 10-year bonds headed for
their first weekly gain in three as the rupee’s rebound led to
speculation the central bank may reverse liquidity-tightening
measures taken to support the currency.  The rupee rose 2 percent this week, poised for its best
performance since Nov. 30, 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The currency rallied after sinking to a record 68.845 per
dollar on Aug. 28 as  Raghuram Rajan , who took charge as  Reserve
Bank  of India governor on Sept. 4, announced steps to boost
dollar supply. Lower than estimated U.S. job additions eased
concern the  Federal Reserve  will aggressively cut stimulus that
has driven demand for emerging-market assets.  The yield on 7.16 percent sovereign notes due May 2023 fell
11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, this week to 8.52
percent, according to the central bank’s trading system. The
rate rose two basis points as of 10:04 a.m. in Mumbai today.  “The market is now looking at the reversal of some of the
liquidity-tightening steps on the policy day,” said Sagar Shah,
associate vice president for treasury at The Ratnakar Bank Ltd.
in Mumbai. “The rupee’s stability has certainly helped improve
sentiment.”  Ten-year  government bonds  slumped in each of the past three
months, the longest losing streak since August 2010, as the RBI
raised two  interest rates  and tightened cash supply to stem the
rupee’s slide. A weaker currency stokes  inflation  as India
imports about 80 percent of its oil needs. The RBI’s next
scheduled policy meeting is on Sept. 20.  Fed Stimulus  Overseas funds have  pulled  $10.5 billion from Indian debt
since May 22, when Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  first signaled
the plan to pare $85 billion a month of bond purchases should
the jobs market show signs of improvement. U.S. nonfarm payrolls
rose 169,000 in August, less than the median 180,000 estimate in
a Bloomberg survey, a report showed Sept. 6.  The Fed will reduce Treasury purchases to  $35 billion  from
$45 billion at its Sept. 17-18 meeting, while maintaining
mortgage-debt buying at  $40 billion , according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  India’s one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract
used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose three
basis points this week and today to 9.29 percent, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
