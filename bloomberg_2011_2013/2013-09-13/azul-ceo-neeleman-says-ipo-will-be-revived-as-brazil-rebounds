Azul Linhas Aereas Brasileiras SA
founder and Chief Executive Officer David Neeleman, who canceled
the carrier’s initial public offering last month, said he’s
confident in the Brazilian economy and intends to do an IPO.  “The timing wasn’t right,” Neeleman, who also created
 JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU) , said in an interview today on CNBC. “It
was more of a market conditions issue and I think market
conditions in Brazil will rebound.”  Azul, the third-largest carrier in Brazil by market share,
sought to raise as much as 1 billion reais ($440 million)
through the IPO, a person familiar with the plan said in June.
The company, based in Barueri, Brazil, scrapped the plan in
August because of “unfavorable macroeconomic conditions.”  The real has fallen about 10 percent against the U.S.
dollar this year, increasing the price of imports and jet fuel.
No Brazilian company has completed a sale since July, when
renewable energy producer  CPFL Energias Renovaveis SA (CPRE3)  raised 900
million reais. Brazil’s biggest cement maker, Votorantim
Cimentos SA, also suspended a $3.7 billion IPO in August.  Neeleman said he intends to go ahead with an IPO for Azul,
which will trade on both the Bovespa index and as American
depository receipts on the  New York  Stock Exchange.  “We’ll get it back on track,” Neeleman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
