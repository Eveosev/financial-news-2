Royal DSM NV (DSM)  Chief Executive
Officer Feike Sijbesma comments on the role of Chinese
urbanization in driving economic growth and the comany’s
business in the nation. He spoke today in an interview in the
Chinese city of Dalian, where he’s attending a conference
organized by the  World Economic Forum .  “If everybody’s talking about the slowdown of the economy,
we should break down the growth. The biggest part of China’s
economy is coming from investment, but that won’t last forever.
At the end of the day, China needs to have its own domestic
consumption market.”  “In the fields of nutrition, China is very important.
Urbanization is a big topic here in China. Everyday a farmer
leaves the rural area for the cities, we lose a food producer,
we gain a food consumer. This is a big driver for our growth.”  “ Growth rate  for the Chinese economy is 7-8 percent. Our
sales growth in China, we are above that figure.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
