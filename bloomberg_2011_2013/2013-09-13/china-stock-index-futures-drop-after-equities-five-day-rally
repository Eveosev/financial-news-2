China’s stocks  fell the most in a
month, led by shippers and banks, after UBS AG downgraded  China 
Shipping Development Co. and investors speculated a three-week
rally on the  Shanghai  free-trade zone’s prospects was overdone.  Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co. (600000)  slid 2.8 percent after
valuations jumped to a six-month high this week. China Shipping
Development tumbled 5.3 percent, paring a rally since Aug. 22 to
42 percent.  Jiangxi Copper Co. (600362)  and Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd.
retreated at least 1.4 percent, pacing declines for raw-material
producers after metal prices slumped yesterday.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell for the first time in six
days, losing 0.9 percent to 2,236.22 at the close, the biggest
drop since Aug. 15. The 14-day relative strength index,
measuring how rapidly prices have risen or dropped during a
specified time period, was at 74.7 today. Readings above 70 show
a price may be poised to fall.  “It’s good to see some corrections for stocks after the
recent rally,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based fund manager at
Dragon Life Insurance Co., which oversees $3.3 billion in
assets. “After the correction, we’ll see stocks continue to go
up as there are lots of expectations about reform measures from
the government.”  The Shanghai measure is  valued  at 9 times its projected 12-month earnings, compared with the five-year average of 12.6
times, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Trading volumes
were 29 percent above the 30-day average today.  Rebound Continues  The CSI 300 Index slid 0.7 percent to 2,488.90 today. The
 Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  lost 1.3 percent. The
Bloomberg China-US Equity Index dropped 1.3 percent yesterday.  The Shanghai index gained 4.5 percent this week, the most
since February. It has rebounded 15 percent since reaching this
year’s low on June 27 as August data ranging from exports to
industrial output showed growth is accelerating and as shippers
and port operators rallied after the State Council approved
Shanghai’s free-trade zone.  The rebound in Chinese equity markets should continue as
economic growth bottoms and the government resumes funding some
urbanization-related projects, Khiem Do, head of multi-asset
strategy at Baring Asset Management Asia, said in a phone
interview. Industrial companies, banks and materials producers
will gain momentum, he said.  Shanghai Pudong Bank slid 2.8 percent to 11.91 yuan, paring
this week’s rally to 24 percent.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China Ltd. (601398)  fell 1.5 percent to 3.99 yuan. Gauges of financial
and industrial stocks in the CSI 300 jumped 8.9 percent and 6.2
percent this week, the biggest gains among 10  industry groups ,
on speculation the trade zone will boost profit.  Shippers Drop  China will push forward interest-rate and exchange-rate
reforms and the internationalization of the yuan while promoting
the currency’s convertibility under the capital account, Premier
Li Keqiang said in a Sept. 11 speech at the  World Economic Forum 
in the northeast city of Dalian.  China Shipping Development, a unit of the country’s second-biggest sea-cargo group, slid 5.3 percent to 5.02 yuan. The
stock had its rating cut to neutral from buy, Judy Chen, an
analyst at UBS, said by phone today.  Shanghai International Port Group Co. (600018)  slumped 2.5 percent
to 6.51 yuan. The port operator has climbed 155 percent since
Aug. 22, when the Ministry of Commerce said the city’s free-trade zone proposal was approved in July. That’s the most among
the 995 companies on the Shanghai Composite.  Economic reforms by the new central government will be
first applied in the trade zone as a national strategy, the
Shanghai Daily reported today, citing Wang Xinkui, head of the
city government’s counselor office.  Jiangxi Copper, China’s biggest producer of the metal, fell
1.4 percent to 17.23  yuan .  Aluminum Corp. of China , the listed
unit of nation’s biggest maker of the lightweight metal, lost
3.6 percent to 3.78 yuan. Copper futures dropped to a five-week
low yesterday as economic data from  Australia  to Europe fanned
concern that metal demand may ebb.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
