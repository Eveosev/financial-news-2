Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR3) , the most
indebted publicly traded oil company, agreed to sell oil blocks
and pipelines in  Colombia  to Perenco UK Ltd. for $380 million.  “The Petrobras Colombia assets that are part of the
transaction include 11 onshore exploration and production blocks
with an average production of 6,530 barrels of oil equivalent
per day, as well as the Colombia and Alto Magdalena oil
pipelines,” Petrobras, as  Brazil ’s state-run producer is known,
said in a regulatory filing today. The sale is pending approval
from Colombia’s oil regulator.  Petrobras is selling overseas assets to help finance
development of its so-called pre-salt oil reserves below the
Brazilian seabed. The Rio de Janeiro-based company sold 50
percent stakes in African assets to Grupo BTG Pactual for $1.5
billion last month. Petrobras is spending more than 60 percent
of its $237 billion five-year business plan on exploration and
production, mostly in the pre-salt area.  Petrobras said in the filing it will hold on to its
offshore oil blocks, one onshore block and gasoline stations in
Colombia. Perenco, the oil producer that scrapped an initial
public offering of its Brazilian unit in 2011, is an operator
and non-operator of Colombian oil-fields.  HSBC Holdings Plc advised Petrobras on the sale.  China National Petroleum Corp., the country’s largest oil
producer, was considering buying Petrobras assets in Colombia
and  Peru , people familiar with the sale said July 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
