AXA SA (CS) ’s U.K. wealth services unit
was fined 1.8 million pounds ($2.9 million) for giving poor
advice to some of its customers about investment products.  AXA Wealth Services will contact customers and decide
whether to compensate them, the London-based U.K. Financial
Conduct Authority said in a statement today.  AXA didn’t always explain the risks of products it was
selling, gather enough information from customers, and failed to
make sure consumers could manage investments if their value
fell, the FCA said. The insurer also had an “unacceptable
risk” that sales advisers would give inappropriate
recommendations to customers to boost their own bonuses, the
regulator said.  “AXA fell short of its responsibilities to customers, many
of whom were elderly, retired and financially inexperienced,”
Tracey McDermott, the FCA’s head of enforcement, said in the
statement.  The Paris-based insurer sold about 37,000 investment
products to 26,000 customers during the relevant period, from
Sept. 15, 2010, and April 30, 2012, according to the regulator.  “We are cooperating with the regulator, we are very
serious in regulatory compliance,” said Axa’s Paris-based
spokeswoman Garance Wattez-Richard. “We regret that the advice
didn’t fulfill FCA’s very high standards.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
