German government bonds fell, with
10-year  securities  set for a second weekly decline, as signs of
a global economic recovery damped demand for the euro area’s
safest sovereign assets.  Austrian, Dutch and French bonds snapped two-day gains
before a report next week that analysts said will show a gauge
of German investor confidence climbed to a six-month high in
September. U.S. data yesterday showed initial jobless claims
dropped to the lowest since 2006. Treasuries declined before the
Federal Reserve meets next week amid speculation that policy
makers will slow asset purchases.  “We’ve had a weaker start to the day in bunds but that’s
essentially reflecting a drift higher in Treasury yields,” said
 Padhraic Garvey , head of developed-market bonds strategy at ING
Bank NV in Amsterdam. “It’s an ongoing reduction in the risk
profile geopolitically and in the wake of yesterday’s jobless-claims numbers which were supportive of the U.S. recovery.”  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.01 percent at 10:53 a.m. London time. The
rate has increased six basis points  this week . The 2 percent
security due in August 2023 fell 0.07, or 70 euro cents per
1,000-euro ($1,330) face amount, to 99.93.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
will say its  index  of German investor and analyst expectations
rose to 45.5 from 42 in August, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg  survey  before the data is released on Sept. 17.  “We remain sellers at current levels on a medium-term
perspective, but we see room for a stabilization today in the
2-2.05 percent area,” strategists at BNP Paribas SA, including
Eric Oynoyan, wrote in an e-mailed note to clients.  Yields Rise  Austria ’s 10-year yield was little changed at 2.40 percent.
The rate on similar-maturity Dutch bonds were also little
changed, at 2.38 percent. French 10-year bonds yielded 2.56
percent after falling to 2.53 percent yesterday, the lowest
since Sept. 4.  The Federal Open Market Committee will decide at its Sept.
17-18 meeting to reduce monthly purchases of Treasuries to $35
billion from $45 billion, according to the median of 34
responses in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Officials will
maintain mortgage-bond buying at $40 billion, the survey shows.  The Treasury 10-year note  yield  added one basis point to
2.92 percent after  reaching  3.005 percent on Sept. 6, the
highest since July 2011.  German bonds lost 2.7 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.  French (GFRN10)  securities
lost 2.2 percent, while those of the Netherlands dropped 3.3
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
