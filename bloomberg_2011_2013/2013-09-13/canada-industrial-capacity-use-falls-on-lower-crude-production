Canadian industrial companiesâ€™ use
of their production capacity decreased in the second quarter as
crude producers scaled back output.  The share of plant  capacity  in use fell to 80.6 percent in
the April-June period from a revised 80.8 percent in the first
quarter, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. The result
matched the median estimate in a Bloomberg economist survey with
11 responses.  Capacity use at oil and gas extraction companies dropped
1.4 percentage points to 85.7 percent. Mining and quarrying
companies use fell 0.1 percentage point to 65.5 percent.  Manufacturing capacity use as a whole fell to 79.2 percent
from 79.4 percent. The main factor was a 7.2 percentage-point
decline in the primary-metals industry to 72.5 percent, bringing
it to the lowest since the third quarter of 2009, according to
Statistics Canada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
