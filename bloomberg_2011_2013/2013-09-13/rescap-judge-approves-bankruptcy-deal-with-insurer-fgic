The judge overseeing Residential
Capital LLC’s bankruptcy approved a settlement under which
Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. will pay $253.3 million to
investors and collect about $206.5 million from the failed
mortgage company and its affiliates.  The deal would end FGIC’s attempt to collect as much as
$5.5 billion the bond insurer claimed it was owed by ResCap and
two related entities.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in  New York  called the
settlement “fair and equitable” and in the best interest of
investors who purchased mortgage bonds insured by FGIC. The
$253.3 million payment would cancel the insurance policies on
the bonds.  ResCap, based in New York, has been settling disputes with
creditors as it prepares for a hearing in November where it will
ask Glenn to approve a plan to distribute billions of dollars to
creditors. Unsecured creditors would get 36 percent of what they
are owed under the plan, while debts backed by collateral will
be paid in full.  The plan is based on a $2.1 billion settlement with
ResCap’s parent,  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) , and creditors, including
mortgage bond investors who blame both companies for their
losses.  The case is In re Residential Capital LLC, 12-bk-12020,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
