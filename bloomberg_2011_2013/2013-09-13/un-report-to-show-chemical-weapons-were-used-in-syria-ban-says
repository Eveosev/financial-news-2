A report by United Nations inspectors will show that chemical weapons were used on Aug. 21 in  Syria , UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said today.  A team has been analyzing evidence gathered in Syria about the attack in the eastern suburbs of Damascus, which the U.S. says was launched by Syrian government forces and killed more than 1,400 people.  Ban, in comments today at a UN development forum in New York, said the inspectors’ report will be released “as soon as possible.”  The UN chief said he is “very much troubled” by divisions over Syria among members of the UN Security Council, which hasn’t been able to adopt any resolutions on humanitarian, political and security issues regarding Syria during 2 1/2 years of conflict.  If the deadlock continues it will represent a “failure” by the UN, Ban said.  While it is up to the Syrian people to decide whether to oust President Bashar al-Assad, Ban said, the regime’s leader has “committed many crimes against humanity” and will be held accountable when the conflict is over.
