Cocoa fell from the highest in
almost one year in New York as rain in West Africa, the biggest
growing region, may help relieve crops after dry weather. Sugar
climbed for a seventh day, the longest streak in almost a year.  About 1 to 1.25 inches of rain fell in parts of Ivory Coast
the past few days and about half an inch in  Ghana , Kyle Tapley,
senior agriculture meteorologist at MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said today. Cocoa jumped 13 percent the
past two months on speculation dry weather would damage crops
for the harvest that starts next month, leading hedge funds and
other speculators to bet on more price gains.  “Some of the recent long position is certainly based on
the dry weather concerns in West Africa, and therefore may lose
its nerve should rains continue as normal,” Marex Spectron
Group Ltd. in London said in a report yesterday. “For this to
translate into a more serious liquidation of the spec position
involving the system funds, some members of the industry will
have to develop nerves of steel.”  Cocoa for December delivery dropped 0.4 percent to $2,581 a
metric ton by 8:14 a.m. in New York on ICE Futures U.S. Prices
earlier today climbed to $2,609, the most since Sept. 17.  Raw sugar for March delivery climbed 0.1 percent to 17.74
cents a pound on ICE. Prices rose 8.3 percent in the past seven
sessions, the longest streak for a most-active contract since
Sept. 17. Kingsman SA lowered its forecast for a surplus in the
2013-14 season by 4.6 percent, saying demand is improving.  To contact the reporter on this story:
