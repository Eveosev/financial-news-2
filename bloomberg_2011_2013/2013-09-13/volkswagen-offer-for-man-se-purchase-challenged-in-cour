Volkswagen AG (VOW)  was sued in a German
court by  MAN SE (MAN)  minority shareholders who want VW to pay more
than what they’re offering for the company.  At least two shareholders have filed separate lawsuits over
the price VW offered under the agreement for the deal, Stefanie
Ruhwinkel, a spokeswoman for the Munich Regional Court, said in
an interview today. She declined to identify the plaintiffs, who
filed their cases in August.  After VW won approval for the plan at a shareholder meeting
in June, Ferdinand Piech, chairman of both companies, said he
expected a lengthy legal battle over the offer price. In a
related lawsuit, MAN provided investors with data about the
valuation of the company that might be used to force a price
increase in the new cases.  Several suits have been filed, Marco Dalan, a VW spokesman,
said in an interview. He also declined to comment on who sued or
any other details because the cases are pending.  VW, which is required under German law to offer to buy out
minority owners, proposed purchasing the truck maker’s remaining
stock for 80.89 euros ($107.54) a share. Investors who don’t
accept the cash deal will receive an annual dividend of 3.07
euros per share.  Today’s cases are LG Muenchen, 5 HKO 17135/13 and 17521/13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
