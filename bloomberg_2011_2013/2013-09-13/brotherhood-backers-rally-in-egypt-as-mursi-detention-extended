Supporters of  Egypt ’s Muslim
Brotherhood and ousted President Mohamed Mursi took to the
streets as authorities announced a 30-day extension to his
detention pending probes into charges against him.  Protesters poured out of mosques after Friday prayers and
marched through streets in Cairo, Giza, Assiut, Helwan and
Alexandria, live televised footage showed. They held yellow
cards showing the four fingers of a hand, a gesture adopted to
show solidarity with the victims of an Aug. 14 raid by security
forces on sit-ins of Mursi supporters that triggered a week of
bloodshed in which about 1,000 people died.  The detention of Mursi’s chief of staff, Refaa El-Tahtawi,
was extended for 15 days, state-run  Ahram Online  reported. Mursi
has been held in a secret location since his ouster by the
military on July 3. Allegations against him include claims he
incited violence during deadly unrest in December, and escaping
and assisting others to escape from Wadi al-Natrun jail, where
he was detained before the 2011 uprising against  Hosni Mubarak .  Dozens of senior Muslim Brotherhood figures have been
arrested in the past two months. The Brotherhood, from which
Mursi hails, and its allies have vowed to maintain
demonstrations until he is restored to office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
