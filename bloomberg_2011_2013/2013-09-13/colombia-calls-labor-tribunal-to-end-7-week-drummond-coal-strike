Colombia ’s Labor Ministry today
called an “obligatory arbitration panel” to resolve a seven-week strike that has paralyzed coal output at Drummond Co., the
country’s second-biggest producer.  The decision, which “implies the lifting of the strike in
said company” is open to appeal, the ministry said in an e-mailed statement. A majority of Drummond’s mine, port and rail
workers last week voted to end the stoppage.  Drummond, whose 26 million metric tons of coal output last
year represented about 29 percent of Colombia’s production,
supplies coal to European power producers including  Electricite
de France SA. (EDF)  Coal is the country’s biggest export after oil.  Workers’ vote to end the strike defied the advice of the
leadership of Sintramienergetica, the biggest union representing
Drummond’s permanent workers in Colombia, who had urged its
members to boycott the vote.  Sintramienergetica negotiators Cesar Flores and Humberto
Suarez said in phone interviews they had not been informed of
Labor Ministry’s ruling.  Workers at Cerrejon, joint-owned by  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,
 Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and Glencore Xstrata Plc went on strike Feb.
7 in a dispute over pay and benefits, halting work at Colombia’s
largest coal mine. The central bank cited paralysis in the coal
industry in March, when it cut its benchmark interest rate half
a percentage point to 3.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
