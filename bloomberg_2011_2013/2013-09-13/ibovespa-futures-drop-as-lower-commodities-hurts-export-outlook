Ibovespa  futures  dropped, after the
equity gauge sank to a one-week low yesterday, as lower
commodities prices dimmed the outlook for Brazilian producers.  Oil company  OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA  may move
after saying it probably will ask bondholders for more cash in a
bid to avoid having to file for bankruptcy. Airline  Gol Linhas
Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL3)  may be active after saying a measure of
profitability known as yield, or the average fare paid by a
passenger to fly one kilometer, increased 33 percent in August
from a year earlier.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in October slipped 0.2
percent to 52,325 at 9:12 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The equity gauge is
down 0.8 percent this week. The real dropped 0.2 percent to
2.2802 per dollar. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw
materials retreated 0.3 percent as oil and metals declined while
investors awaited a U.S Federal Reserve meeting next week that
may signal a scaling back of monetary stimulus.  The Ibovespa entered a bull market on Sept. 9 after rising
20 percent from this year’s low on July 3 through that day. The
gauge is still down 22 percent in dollar terms this year,
compared with a decline of 6.1 percent for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume of stocks in Sao Paulo was 7.16 billion
reais yesterday, compared with a daily average of 7.73 billion
reais this year through Sept. 6, according to data compiled by
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
