Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai headed for a third weekly loss as  steel mills  expanded
production while demand remained lackluster.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange declined as much as 1 percent to 3,672 yuan ($600) a
metric ton, the lowest since Aug. 6, and was at 3,678 yuan at
10:07 a.m. local time. The most-active contract has lost 1.2
percent this week.  China’s crude steel output advanced in August as
profitability rose, with production jumping to 66.3 million tons
from 65.47 million tons in July, according to the National
Bureau of Statistics. While September is usually a peak season
for building material consumption, there are few signs now of
strong season demand, said Dang Man, an analyst at Maike Futures
Co. in Xi’an.  “End-users seem to have become cautious, so demand in the
 spot market  looks sluggish,” Dang said. “Low inventory offers
some support, but given the high mills output, there’ll be
increasing pressure on the supply side.”  The average  spot  price of rebar fell 0.2 percent to 3,567
 yuan  a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port was little
changed at $135.20 a dry ton yesterday, according to a  price
index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd. The steel-making
ingredient reached its five-month high at $142.80 on Aug. 14.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
