Hong Kong  stocks  fell, with the
benchmark index paring its biggest two-week gain in a year, as
property developers and materials shares led declines.  China  Coal Energy Co., the country’s second-largest
producer of the fuel, sank 3.1 percent after the government said
it will cut coal consumption.  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16) , the
world’s second-biggest developer, fell 1.4 percent after
trimming its sales target. Gold producers led materials
companies lower as the precious metal headed for its steepest
weekly loss since June amid expectations the U.S. Federal Open
Market Committee will next week decide to reduce stimulus.  The Hang Seng Index slid 0.2 percent to close at 22,915.28
in Hong Kong, paring its advance since Aug. 30 to 5.5 percent.
About three stocks retreated for every two that gained. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) , also known as the H-share index,
declined 0.9 percent to 10,538.94.  “The market had big gains in the short term, and the FOMC
meeting is coming up so it’s reasonable to have some profit-taking,” said Linus Yip, a strategist at First Shanghai
Securities in Hong Kong. “Global recovery is the major story
right now. Overall the upward trend is intact.”  The H-share index entered a bull market this week after
rebounding more than 20 percent from a June low, while the  Hang
Seng Index (HSI)  erased its 2013 loss. Stocks climbed as data showed
China’s inflation remained subdued in August, while export
growth, factory output and retail sales beat expectations. Hong
Kong’s equity benchmark traded at 10.9 times estimated earnings,
compared with a multiple of 15.2 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  Growth Targets  Bank of America Merrill Lynch boosted its economic growth
estimate for China this year to 7.7 percent from 7.6 percent,
joining Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
Deutsche Bank AG in raising predictions for expansion in the
world’s second-biggest economy. The government has defended its
target for 7.5 percent annual growth.  China’s State Council yesterday said it will reduce coal
consumption in an effort to “gradually eliminate” heavily
polluted days in as soon as a decade. A rebound in coal prices
in China is being limited by overcapacity, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. analyst Julian Zhu said yesterday.  China Coal slid 3.1 percent to HK$5.06.  China Shenhua
Energy Co. (1088) , the nation’s top coal miner by market value,
retreated 3.3 percent to HK$25.15.  Stimulus Concern  Futures on the S&P 500 were little changed today. The gauge
dropped yesterday amid growing concern over  Syria  and as
investors weighed the prospects for Federal Reserve stimulus
cuts. The Fed will decide to cut its $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases by $10 billion when it meets Sept. 17-18, according to
65 percent of economists surveyed by Bloomberg last month.  U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is in Geneva discussing
a deal with  Russia  for the removal of Syria’s chemical weapons.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said any deal to surrender the
nation’s chemical arsenal must be a “two-way street” in which
the administration of President  Barack Obama  drops its military
threats and stops arming Syrian rebels.  Gold producers declined as the price of the metal headed
for its first annual loss in 13 years as it loses appeal as a
haven asset. Zijin Mining Group Co. retreated 1.6 percent to
HK$1.82.  Zhaojin Mining Industry Co. (1818) , the mainland’s No. 2 gold
producer, plunged 4.7 percent to HK$6.44.  A measure of property companies  dropped the most  among the
Hang Seng Index’s industry groups. Sun Hung Kai slid 1.4 percent
to HK$101.70 after cutting its net-income forecast and reporting
full-year underlying profit that missed estimates.  Sun Hung Kai  Sun Hung Kai plans to sell HK$28 billion ($3.6 billion) of
homes in Hong Kong and mainland China in the year through June
2014, Deputy Managing Director Victor Lui said yesterday. That
compares with sales of HK$32.9 billion a year earlier.  Among stocks that climbed,  Sino Biopharmaceutical Ltd. (1177) 
gained 3.4 percent to HK$4.92 after saying it’s investigating
media reports of alleged bribery at its unit. The drugmaker said
neither senior management nor board members of the group were
involved. The shares yesterday plunged the most since 2000.  Futures on the Hong Kong gauge fell 0.2 percent to 22,933.
The HSI Volatility Index climbed 0.1 percent to 16.71,
indicating traders expect the benchmark equity index to swing
4.8 percent in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
