CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE)  halted trading
on its C2 options exchange for about 47 minutes following a
malfunction that prevented it from sending information to the
equity derivatives industry’s main price feed.  The options venue was paused at 10:03 a.m.  Chicago  time and
resumed at 10:50 a.m., according to a  notice  on CBOE’s website.
Another bulletin said C2 had stopped sending data to the
marketwide price feed at 9:45 a.m. Chicago time.  C2 is the smaller of U.S. options markets owned by CBOE
Holdings, accounting for 1.9 percent of trading in August versus
almost 29 percent at the  Chicago Board Options Exchange . Its
outage comes three weeks after Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. had to stop
trading in the stocks it lists because of an error involving its
data feed for equity prices.  Following the restart, a notice on CBOE’s website at 11:41
a.m. Chicago time said some customers had reported not receiving
order acknowledgements and fill and cancel messages. The company
is looking into the issue.  Today’s malfunction also briefly shut the CBOE Stock
Exchange, which makes up less than 1 percent of the U.S. stock
market.  Gail Osten, a CBOE spokeswoman in Chicago, declined to
comment beyond the notices on the company’s system-status
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
