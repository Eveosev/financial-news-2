Hog futures advanced for a second
day on signs of increasing overseas purchases of U.S. pork.
Cattle also rose.  U.S.  exporters  shipped 406.57 million pounds (184,416
metric tons) of pork in July, up 1.9 percent from June and 2.1
percent more than a year earlier, the latest government data
show. Shipments will total 5.31 billion pounds in 2014, up from
an August estimate of 5.255 billion and 4 percent higher than
2013, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said yesterday.  “The monthly exports that were out were good,”  Christian Mayer , a market analyst at Northstar Commodity Investments in
 Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview. “There’s more talk
of better exports coming along as well.”  Hog futures for December settlement advanced 0.7 percent to
