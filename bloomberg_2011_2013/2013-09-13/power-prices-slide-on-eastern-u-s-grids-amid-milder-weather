Spot wholesale electricity tumbled
for a second day from Boston to Washington and Chicago as milder
weather reduced air-conditioning demand.  Power consumption on the 13-state PJM Interconnection LLC
grid, which serves more than 60 million people from the East
Coast to the Ohio Valley, was 98,250 megawatts at 1 p.m., 21
percent lower than the same time yesterday, according to the
operator’s  website .  Sweltering heat that swept the Northeast, Midwest and mid-Atlantic states earlier this week gave way to cooler-than-normal
readings today, according to AccuWeather Inc. in State College,
Pennsylvania. The high in Chicago may be 64 degrees Fahrenheit
(18 Celsius), 13 below normal, and Washington may be 2 lower
than average at 79 degrees.  Spot prices at PJM’s benchmark Western hub, which includes
deliveries to Washington, fell $58.08, or 65 percent, to $31.93
a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 1 p.m. from the same
time yesterday, grid data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  New York City power dropped $85.41, or 68 percent, to
$40.01 a megawatt-hour and Boston slid $15.47, or 25 percent, to
$47.58. On-peak power for New York traded at a discount of $5.31
to Boston, compared with a premium of $18.74 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
