Indian cricketer S. Sreesanth was
banned from all formats of the game for life for manipulating
Twenty20 matches in the lucrative  Indian Premier League .  The Rajasthan Royals fast bowler received the punishment at
a New Delhi disciplinary hearing held by the  Board of Control
for Cricket in India .  Sreesanth’s teammate Ankeet Chavan was also banned for life
and fellow Royals player Siddarth Trivedi received a one-year
suspension for failing to report an approach, the BCCI said in a
statement. A case against Harmeet Singh was dismissed due to the
absence of evidence.  Sreesanth, 30, and Chavan, 27, were arrested in May as part
of a probe into spot-fixing at the Jaipur-based Rajasthan
Royals. In spot-fixing, players manipulate specific actions in a
game, such as the number of no-balls bowled or the number of
runs a batsman makes, rather than the result of a match.  Sreesanth played 27 Test matches and 53 one-day games for
 India . He last played for the national team in 2011.  Formed in 2008, the IPL is the world’s richest cricket
competition, worth $3.67 billion, according to London-based
Brand Finance Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
