Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. (APN) ,
South Africaâ€™s largest drugmaker, started offering $2.04 billion
of acquisition loans to a bigger group of lenders after
attracting commitments from nine banks.  The debt includes $967.5 million of three-year loans that
will pay an initial interest margin of 240 basis points, or 2.4
percentage points, more than benchmark rates, the company said
in a statement. It is offering a margin of 250 basis points on
$967.5 million of five-year facilities.  Aspen agreed to a $1 billion deal in June to buy
pharmaceutical assets from Merck & Co. and it has offered to buy
heart medicines and a manufacturing site from GlaxoSmithKline
Plc for about 700 million pounds ($1.1 billion). The Durban,
South Africa-based company said Sept. 11 it expected the deals
would boost earnings this year.  Absa Bank Ltd., BNP Paribas SA, Nedbank Ltd., Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, Standard Chartered Plc,  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) ,
Investec Bank Ltd., National Australia Bank Ltd. and Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. committed to the loan in the first
round of syndication, Aspen said. Bank of America Corp. and
Standard Bank Group Ltd. are arranging the facility.  Aspen also raised 7.33 billion rand ($726m) of loans for
its Pharmacare Ltd. unit after receiving an oversubscription
from lenders, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
