PNC Financial Services Group Inc.
Executive Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer Jim Rohr
won’t seek re-election to board of directors for the lender or
for  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the companies said.  Rohr, who was elected today to the board of  General
Electric Co. (GE) , notified PNC that he doesn’t plan to seek another
term at the April annual meeting, the Pittsburgh-based bank said
today in a filing. He also won’t pursue re-election to
BlackRock’s board at its meeting in May, the New York-based
asset manager said in a separate filing.  PNC, the second-biggest U.S. regional bank, is the largest
 holder  of BlackRock shares with a 21 percent stake, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Bill Demchak succeeded Rohr as PNC’s
CEO in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
