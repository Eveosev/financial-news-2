Golf’s  Evian Masters  will be
reduced to three rounds after rain washed out yesterday’s
opening day at the fifth women’s golf major championship of the
year.  While the first round was played today, the forecast is for
more rain through the weekend, forcing organizers to reduce the
tournament in Evian-les-Bains,  France , to 54 holes, if possible.
The field will be reduced to the top 70 players and ties after
36 holes.  Mika Miyazato of  Japan   leads  at 6-under-par, with South
Korea’s Se Ri Pak, Germany’s Sandra Gal and Norway’s Suzann Pettersen tied at 5-under. American Christina Kim is alone in
fifth place at 4-under.  To contact the reporter on this story:
