With Puerto Rico bonds rallying for
the longest stretch in a month, yields on benchmark municipal
debt gained the most since April, beating Treasuries.  Yields on top-rated 10-year munis were  3.04 percent  at 1
p.m. in New York, down from 3.15 percent last week, the highest
since April 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It’s the
steepest weekly decline since April 12. Yields on 10-year
federal obligations have fallen 0.04 percentage point for the
week to  2.89 percent .  Puerto Rico general obligations gained in price the past
three days, Standard & Poor’s data show. Yields on the
securities reached record highs this week. The island’s economy
contracted by 5 percent in the year through July, the biggest
decline since February 2010, according to the U.S. territory’s
Government Development Bank, which handles the commonwealth’s
market transactions.  The island’s securities gained in the three days through
Sept. 12 after dropping 2.2 percent Sept. 9, the steepest
decline since Aug. 28, S&P data show. Prices move inversely to
yields.  The most frequently traded munis in 2012 were commonwealth
general obligations sold last year and maturing in July 2041,
according to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. The
bonds traded today with an average yield of 8.4 percent, the
lowest since Aug. 30, after soaring to almost 9.3 percent Sept.
11, the highest ever, Bloomberg data show.  Supply Shrinks  Munis were also buoyed by reduced supply. Issuers from
California to Massachusetts are set to borrow  $5.3 billion  of
debt in the next 30 days, the least since June 6 and below the
one-year average of $9.6 billion, according to Bloomberg data.  “It’s the first time we’ve seen buyers really step in,
probably since July,” said Hardy Manges, head of muni trading
at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities in New York. “You had a slowdown
in the selling, and Puerto Rico sellers seemed to have slowed
down also.”  The price of the iShares S&P National AMT-Free Municipal
Bond Fund, the largest exchange-traded fund tracking the  $3.7
trillion (MUB)  municipal market, climbed to $102 as of 1:56 p.m. in
New York, the highest since Aug. 27, Bloomberg data show. The
price has increased for six straight trading days, the longest
rally since November 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
