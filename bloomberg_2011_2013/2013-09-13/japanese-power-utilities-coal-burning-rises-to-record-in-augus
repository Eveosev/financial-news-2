Japan ’s regional utilities consumed
a record volume of coal while cutting their use of higher-priced
fuel oil and crude, according to the Federation of Electric
Power Cos.  Japan’s utilities used about 5.7 million metric tons of
coal in August, up 21 percent from a year earlier, data from the
industry group show today. That’s the most coal consumed since
the federation started compiling figures from the 10 companies
in 1972, according to its spokesman. Fuel oil and crude demand
fell by 28 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively.  Coal burning by the utilities has been increasing year on
year as  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  began test operations at two
plants in April while  Tohoku Electric (9506)  Power Co. in March resumed
commercial operations at a unit shut by the March 2011
earthquake and tsunami. Japan, where nuclear power provided
about 30 percent of electricity prior to the disaster, will shut
its only operating reactor on Sept. 15 for maintenance. The
country hasn’t announced a schedule for restarting any of its
atomic facilities.  The following table shows Japanese utilities’ consumption
and purchases of fuel oil, crude, liquefied natural gas and coal
in August, based on FEPC data. Fuel oil and crude volumes are in
kiloliters, while those for LNG and coal are in tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
