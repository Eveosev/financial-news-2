Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
expanded a second day as prices for the biofuel plummeted to the
lowest level in three years on speculation that feedstock costs
will ease.  The spread, or price difference, swelled 5.3 cents to 96.77
cents a gallon at 12:16 p.m.  New York  time. The U.S. Agriculture
Department forecast yesterday that corn output will be 13.84
billion bushels this year, the most ever and up from 13.763
billion estimated last month. Ethanol is made mostly from the
grain in the U.S., with one bushel making at least 2.75 gallons
of the renewable fuel.  “That lowers feedstock costs for ethanol producers, which
weighs on the price,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn
Group in Chicago. “It just keeps sinking, doesn’t it?”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery slid 5.9 cents, or
3.2 percent, to $1.789 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest since August 2010. Futures have dropped 18 percent
this year.  Gasoline for October delivery decreased 0.6 cent to $2.7567
a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract
covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  The U.S. corn harvest is usually from September to
November. Kitt said the market expects end users to pay less for
the grain as more supply becomes available.  November ethanol is trading at a 12.9-cent discount to the
October contract.  Corn Slips  Corn for December delivery fell 7.5 cents, or 1.6 percent,
to $4.5875 a bushel in Chicago. The December crush spread of
corn to ethanol was minus 4.5 cents a gallon. The September corn
contract, which expires today, fell 20 cents to $4.59.  Drought in the summer of 2012 baked corn crops and reduced
supply. That raised costs for ethanol producers, forcing
companies to temper output and temporarily shutter operations.  Ethanol  production  in the week ended Sept. 6 rose 3.5
percent to 848,000 barrels a day, data from the U.S. Energy
Information Administration show. That’s down 12 percent from the
record 963,000 barrels a day in December 2011.  Stockpiles last week climbed 0.3 percent to 16.3 million
barrels, the most since Aug. 16.  Ethanol blender inputs , a
measure of demand, tumbled 3.1 percent to 834,000 barrels a day,
an eight-week low. Imports dropped 59 percent to 15,000 barrels
a day last week.  Anhydrous ethanol in Sao Paulo, where sugarcane is used to
make the fuel, cost $2.06 a gallon in the week ended Sept. 6,
the highest since Aug. 2, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
