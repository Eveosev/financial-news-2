DirecTV (DTV) , the largest U.S.
satellite-TV provider, named Anthony Vinciquerra to its board,
adding a former executive of the Fox TV networks.  Vinciquerra is a senior adviser to Texas Pacific Group in
the technology, media and telecommunications industries. He is
the former chairman and chief executive officer of Fox Networks
Group and worked at Hearst Corp.’s broadcasting group and  CBS
Corp. (CBS) ’s television station group in the 1990s.  DirecTV, based in El Segundo, California, is struggling to
add U.S. customers as it combats rising programming fees from
companies such as CBS and  21st Century Fox Inc. (FOXA)  -- the owner of
Fox networks. The satellite operator, which has about 20 million
subscribers, blacked out  Viacom Inc. (VIAB) ’s channels for 10 days last
year after failing to reach agreement on a new contract.  “Tony is a stellar addition to our board, and his counsel
will be extremely valuable to DirecTV as we continue to navigate
through a fiercely competitive environment and increasingly
difficult contract negotiations with programmers,” DirecTV CEO
Mike White said in a statement yesterday.  Vinciquerra’s term will expire on the day of DirecTV’s 2014
annual meeting, according to a company  filing . He will serve on
the company’s nominating and corporate governance committee and
the compensation committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
