Former Chelsea and AC Milan striker
Andriy Shevchenko missed the cut by 25 shots in his debut on
European golf’s second-tier Challenge Tour.  The ex-soccer player shot 14 over-par 86 today at the
Superior Cup in his native Ukraine to finish with a two-round
total of 26-over 170. A score of 144 was needed to play the
final two rounds.  Shevchenko, 36, wound up 40 shots behind leader Sihwan Kim
of  South Korea . Kim tied the course record by shooting 64 today
and is 14 under, six shots ahead of  England ’s Lloyd Kennedy.  Shevchenko, who has a handicap of two, retired from soccer
after playing for Ukraine at the 2012 European Championship. The
former European player of the year had taken part in Pro-Am
events since then and was invited into the field by the
president of the host Superior Golf and Spa Resort in Kharkiv.  Shevchenko finished 121st in the 130-player field. Along
with two birdies and five pars today, he made a quadruple-bogey,
two double-bogeys and eight bogeys.  Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the former French and Australian Open
tennis champion, also missed the cut. The Russian, who has
played events on the top-tier European Tour since retiring from
tennis in 2004, shot a second consecutive 80 today to finish
tied for 110th place at 16 over.  The Challenge Tour was established in 1989 as a place for
professionals to compete as they try to earn their way to the
European Tour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
