South African soybean futures rose
the most in more than two weeks following gains in  Chicago 
yesterday after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  cut the
domestic crop forecast by 3.3 percent.  Soybeans for December delivery, the most active contract,
jumped 2.3 percent to 5,771 rand ($580) a metric ton, the most
since Aug. 27, by the close on the South African Futures
Exchange.  Farmers in the U.S., the world’s top producer, will  harvest 
3.149 billion bushels of soybeans this year, down from 3.255
billion estimated in August, the USDA said yesterday, cutting
its forecast for the second time in as many months. Parts of
Iowa and  Illinois , the biggest growing states, had as little as
5 percent of the normal amount of rain in the last 30 days,
National Weather Service data show.  Soybeans for delivery in November rose 0.1 percent to
$13.9525 a bushel by 8:30 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The price jumped 2.8 percent yesterday to close at $13.96 a
bushel, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since Aug.
26.  “The USDA report which came out yesterday showed that soya
is a bit under pressure,” Kobus Theron, a trader at North West-based Suidwes Landbou (Pty) Ltd., said by phone.  White corn for delivery in December, gained 0.1 percent to
2,344 rand a ton, while the yellow variety declined 0.3 percent
to 2,170 rand a ton.  South Africa , which is the continent’s largest corn grower,
uses yellow corn mainly as  animal feed , while meal made from the
white variety is one of the nation’s staple foods.  To contact the reporter on this story:
