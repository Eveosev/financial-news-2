Soybean meal shipments from  India ,
Asia’s biggest supplier, may reach a six-year high next season
as the best monsoon rainfall in two decades is set to boost the
oilseed crop to an all-time high, a processors’ group said.  Exports in the year starting Oct. 1 may exceed 4.1 million
metric tons estimated for 2012-2013, said Rajesh Agrawal, a
spokesman for the Indore-based Soybean Processors Association of
India. That will be the highest sales since the 4.9 million tons
in 2007-2008. Output of soybeans, crushed into meal for  animal
feed  and oil for cooking and biofuel, may climb to a record 13.5
million tons in 2013-2014, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
 Foreign Agricultural Service  said in a report Sept. 7.  Higher supplies of the meal may curb prices in  Chicago , up
29 percent from a 17-month low in August, as soybeans rallied on
concerns dry weather will curb yields in the U.S. Midwest, the
largest growing region in the world’s biggest producer. In India,
soybean futures are set for a fifth year of gain as demand for
animal feed rose from buyers in Iran,  Japan  and Southeast Asia.  “Indian soybean meal continues to be in great demand from
traditional buyers in  Europe  and  Southeast Asia ,” Agrawal said
in a phone interview on Sept. 11. The nation has contracted to
export about 850,000 tons from the new crop, with stockpiles of
about 500,000 at the start of the season, he said.  Soybean meal for December delivery was at $446 per 2,000
pounds on the Chicago Board of Trade by 12:25 p.m. in Mumbai.
Prices reached $345.30 on Aug. 6, the lowest since Feb. 28, 2012.
Soybeans for delivery in November traded at $13.9125 a bushel,
heading for a sixth week of gain.  Rupee Impact  A weakening Indian rupee, down 13 percent against the
dollar this year, may also boost incentives for exporters to
increase shipments. The currency is the worst performer among 24
major emerging economies in the past six months on concern that
foreign capital outflows will accelerate as the U.S. Federal
Reserve prepares to reduce monetary stimulus.  “With a devalued currency, India can emerge as a
significant exporter of corn, wheat and soya meal in the months
ahead,”  Dorab Mistry , director at Godrej International Ltd.,
said in remarks prepared for a conference in  Singapore  yesterday.  While a weaker currency makes supplies attractive, buyers
adjust their bids to factor in the exchange rate moves, said
Agrawal. Exporters have contracted shipments between $440 a ton
and $500 a ton free-on-board this month compared with the
average of $571 in July, he said. India, which competes with top
exporters Argentina and Brazil, has a freight advantage of $15 a
ton to $20 a ton in South-East Asian markets, he said.  “There is big competition with  South America ,” said
Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive officer of Sunvin Group, who
expects better margins for Indian soybean processors because of
a weaker rupee. Still, the “downgrading of the soybean crop in
the U.S. has improved India’s prospects.”  Farmers will harvest 3.149 billion bushels (85.7 million
tons) of soybeans this year, down from 3.255 billion estimated
in August, the USDA said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
