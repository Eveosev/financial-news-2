U.K. commercial real estate values
rose for the fourth straight month in August, led by office
buildings and warehouses, Investment Property Databank Ltd.
said.  The average value of stores, offices and industrial
properties climbed 0.4 percent from a month earlier, London-based IPD said in a statement today. Total return, which
combines changes in real estate values and rental income, was
0.9 percent, the most since March 2011.  The commercial property market is improving as low interest
rates and bond yields mean investors are seeking assets such as
real estate that generate higher returns. Investors including
insurers  Legal & General Group Plc (LGEN)  and  Aviva Plc (AV/)  are trying to
acquire property outside of London as the economy improves.  Consumer and business conference is rising as a result,
Phil Tily, a managing director at IPD, said in the statement.
“As this growth moves further out of London, income and value
add opportunities in the regions, where income yields often
exceed 8 percent, will start to attract investors willing to
move up the risk curve."  Office building and warehouse values each had a 0.6 percent
gain in August, according to IPD. The average value of retail
properties rose 0.1 percent, ending a 21-month decline. Income-producing commercial properties lost value for 17 consecutive
months through March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
