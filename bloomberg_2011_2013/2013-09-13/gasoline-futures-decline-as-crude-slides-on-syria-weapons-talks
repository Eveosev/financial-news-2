Gasoline declined as crude fell
after the U.S. and Russia began talks about Syria’s chemical
weapons and amid speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will begin
this month to reduce its efforts to stimulate the economy.  Futures headed for their second consecutive weekly loss.
Crude fell as U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  reported a
“constructive” start to the talks, while giving no sign of a
breakthrough. The Fed’s Open Market Committee is forecast to
announce the timing for some tapering of bond purchases when it
meets next week. Crack spreads widened.  “We’re in that twilight zone between war and peace and the
market will swing on headlines today,” said  Phil Flynn , senior
market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “Add to that
the uncertainty about tapering. There’s a lot of nervousness
going long or short into the weekend.”  Gasoline for October delivery fell 0.9 cent to $2.7537 a
gallon at 10:08 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, after
swinging between a high of $2.7798 and a low of $2.748. Trading
volume was 9.9 percent below the 100-day average. Prices have
dropped 3.5 percent this week.  President  Barack Obama  delayed a possible U.S. military
intervention twice: first, on Aug. 31, to consult Congress, then
on Sept. 10 to take up Russia’s proposal for international
oversight of Syria’s chemicals arsenal.  “The market continues to swing back and forth on
uncertainty over what’s going to play out in the  Middle East  and
the outcome of the FOMC meeting,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut .  Gasoline Premium  Gasoline’s premium over crude increased for a second day as
refineries shut units for planned seasonal maintenance, reducing
supplies.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude widened 64 cents to $8.07 a barrel while the
fuel’s  premium  over Brent rose 46 cents to $3.86.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.1 cent to $3.54 a
gallon, 32.9 cents below a year ago, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA
said today on its website.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for October delivery fell 1.54
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $3.101 a gallon, 29 percent below the
100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 29 cents to $22.58 a
barrel while the  premium  over Brent rose 11 cents to $18.37.  To contact the reporter on this story:
