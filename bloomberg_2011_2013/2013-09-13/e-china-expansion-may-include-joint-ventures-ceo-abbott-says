The London Metal Exchange, the
world’s largest metals marketplace, may form partnerships to
expand operations in China as it seeks to establish its first
warehouses in the country and add new contracts.  Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.’s takeover of the LME,
which controls more than 80 percent of industrial-metal futures
contracts, doesn’t mean it will have “a free pass” to grow in
Asia’s largest economy, outgoing LME Chief Executive Officer
Martin Abbott said. The LME plans to offer new commodities
products in coming years, including some that will be tailored
to the Asian market and designed for trading on Hong Kong’s
platforms, Abbott said, without providing further details.  “We have to find a way to break into that Chinese
market,” said Abbott, who will be replaced as CEO by Garry
Jones at the end of this month. “There should be no assumption
that we would just walk in and take business. We’ll have to
fight for it.”  The LME, which has a network of about 700 warehouses
worldwide, is seeking its first foothold in mainland China after
being purchased by Hong Kong Exchanges last year in a $2.2
billion transaction. The Asian bourse has said it plans to
expand the 136-year-old exchange’s presence in China, the
biggest user of industrial metals, and is seeking permission for
the LME to establish warehouses in the country.  The LME proposed changes to its warehousing rules in July
to speed up deliveries of metal as some waits exceed a year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
