Crude options volatility fell a
fifth straight day as underlying futures fell on the receding
threat of an eminent U.S. military strike against  Syria .  At-the-money volatility for November options, a measure of
expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was 21.23
percent at 3:40 p.m., down from 21.75 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery fell 21
cents to $107.54 a barrel on the Nymex, and declined 1.8 percent
this week. The front-month October contract fell 39 cents to
$108.21 a barrel, and retreated 2.1 percent this week.  Crude weakened as the U.S. and  Russia  began talks about
Syria’s chemical weapons. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry
reported a “constructive” start to the discussions, while
giving no sign of a breakthrough.  “The anticipation is that nothing will happen in Syria
for, no missiles will be flying in the next another couple of
weeks,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC
in Houston.  Bets that prices would fall accounted for 52 percent of
electronic trading volume today.  October $110 calls were the most active options today,
