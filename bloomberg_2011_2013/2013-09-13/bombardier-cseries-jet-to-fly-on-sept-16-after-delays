Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  said its CSeries
jetliner will fly for the first time Sept. 16, ending more than
eight months of delays for the $3.4 billion program intended to
challenge  Boeing Co. (BA)  and Airbus SAS.  Flight Test Vehicle 1 will take off from Mirabel airport
north of Montreal, Bombardier said in a statement yesterday. The
company has been conducting ground tests on the plane for
several weeks. This week, the jet reached about 230 kilometers
(143 miles) per hour as part of high-speed taxi testing,
Bombardier  said  Sept. 10.  Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin is relying on the
aircraft, the company’s largest ever, as a catalyst for almost
doubling annual revenue toward the end of the decade. The
world’s third-largest planemaker sparked concern among investors
in November by announcing a six-month delay to the test flight,
which it blamed on unspecified issues with unidentified
suppliers. Two further delays were announced this year.  The CSeries will cost about 15 percent less to operate,
burn about 20 percent less fuel and be about four times quieter
than existing rivals, according to Montreal-based Bombardier.
The plane will use composite materials and a new geared turbofan
engine from  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s  Pratt & Whitney .  To contact the reporter on this story:
