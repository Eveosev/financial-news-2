There’s a place for hedge-fund professionals where everyone knows your name, and it’s not the offices of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The  New York   Hedge Fund Roundtable  gathers some of its 500 members every month. They generally have discussions of best practices.  Last night on the rooftop of the Bryant Park Grill, things got a little rowdier, as the Roundtable celebrated its 10th anniversary. In addition to cocktails and a buffet, there was a raffle: Henry Magram, compliance analyst at Millennium Partners LP, won reimbursement of his fees for the CFA Claritas exam, which he passed.  Alfa Demmellash drew compliments for her firm’s name,  Rising Tide Capital Inc. , printed on her nametag. She had to inform them she’s runs a microfinance nonprofit as its chief executive officer. (The Hedge Fund Roundtable, under the guidance of Carol Van Atten, vice president for programs at the Charles Hayden Foundation, selectively invites philanthropic organizations into its orbit to educate members about giving back.)  Agnieszka Jackowska, a financial-reporting manager at Apollo Group Management LLC, said she recently joined the Hedge Fund Roundtable “to meet like-minded people. You can never forget about face-to-face contact.”  Jackowska has been in the hedge-fund sector for less than a year, after working in  investment banking  for 12 years.  Seeking Freedom  “I switched for the opportunities. Banking has become so regulated,” she said.  One topic she likes to discuss with members is the future of the industry.  “How much regulation will there be? It’s interesting to see the industry grow, how much freedom we’ve had,” Jackowska said.  The party drew a Bermuda contingent and Hedge Fund Roundtable President Tim Selby, a partner at  Alston & Bird LLP , talked of the group’s meeting with hedge-fund executives in  Seoul . The group’s mission is to help  hedge funds  everywhere.  “There are so many good actors, why have the bad actors getting attention?” Selby said.  Ben Plantan, a partner at  Gotham Orient Partners LLC , clamored for a photo with the founder of the Roundtable, Stanley Goldstein.  “I remember when it was 10 people in a room, and someone ran out to get bagels. Or was it doughnuts?” Plantan said.  Town & Country  At Bergdorf Goodman’s men’s store Tuesday night, Town & Country magazine had a Fashion Week party celebrating “Men of Measure” -- and the 30 percent of its readers who are male.  “I’ve been an editor of Men’s Vogue and Vogue, so I know both the male and the female side,” said Jay Fielden, Town & Country’s editor in chief.  “What I think is real style is not dictated by fashion,” Fielden said. “It’s the guys who are comfortable with who they are and the way that they live, whether it’s their dress or the house they live in, or the things they do -- they’re not any kind of feeling of somebody being dressed by somebody else.”  Robin Rotenier , cufflink designer, said he’d just sold a pair of skull cufflinks with white sapphire eyes.  “All these guys want to think of themselves as pirates,” Rotenier said. “Also, there’s a bit of a rocker edge to them. You want to think for five minutes you’re Lenny Kravitz.”  ( Amanda Gordon  is a writer and photographer for Muse, the arts and leisure section of  Bloomberg News .
