The European Securities and Markets
Authority delayed the start of mandatory reporting for over-the-counter derivatives by six weeks to Feb. 12.  Bilateral derivatives transactions have to be reported to a
trade repository as part of the region’s European Market
Infrastructure Regulation, also known as EMIR. The start date
depends on approval of registries, scheduled for Nov. 7, Paris-based ESMA said today on its  website .  “This is a mixed blessing,” Aviv Handler, managing
director of ETR Advisory Ltd., an energy regulation advisory
company, said today by e-mail from London. “It does give people
more time to prepare, but people could be lulled into a false
sense of security, in that they could assume that this date will
keep moving, and so not pursue compliance by the deadline with
sufficient vigor.”  EMIR, which became a European law in August last year, was
created to reduce risk in credit, equity, interest rate, foreign
exchange and commodity markets. The regulation requires all OTC
derivatives transactions to be guaranteed through a clearing
house. Final details of the clearing requirements are scheduled
to be submitted to the European Commission for approval by Sept.
15, 2014 at the latest, ESMA said. They will be enforceable
after that.  To contact the reporter on this story:
