Portugal ’s hotels recorded a 6.7
percent rise in revenue in July from the same month last year,
bolstered by an increase in overnight stays by U.S., German,
Irish, British and French tourists.  Revenue rose to 252.7 million euros ($336 million) in July,
the Lisbon-based National Statistics Institute said today in an
e-mailed statement. In the first seven months of the year,
revenue increased 5.1 percent to 1.05 billion euros.  Tourism represents about a tenth of Portugal’s gross
domestic product, according to the  Economy Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
