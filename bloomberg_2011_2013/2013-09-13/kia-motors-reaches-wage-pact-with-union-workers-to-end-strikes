Kia Motors Corp. (000270) ’s union workers in
South Korea approved a wage agreement that ends a three-week
strike that cost the company an estimated 414 billion won ($381
million) in lost production.  A Sept. 12 agreement between labor representatives and Kia
to raise the monthly base salary by 97,000 won was approved in a
vote today by the company’s 34,000 guild members, according to a
mobile-phone text message from the union.  The accord ends a walkout that the company estimates cost
23,271 vehicles in lost production as of Sept. 11, Kia said in
an e-mail yesterday. The company, together with biggest
shareholder  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , is grappling with increased
competition as a weaker yen gives Japanese carmakers an edge in
the U.S.  Kia was unchanged at 67,000 won at the close in Seoul
trading today. The benchmark Kospi index fell 0.5 percent.  Workers will also get bonuses equivalent to 350 percent of
monthly salary plus a one-time payment of 5 million won,
according to a Sept. 12 statement on the union’s  website .  South Korea ’s second-largest automaker estimates labor
disputes have caused missed production of almost 400,000
vehicles and lost sales worth 6 trillion won from 2002.  Worldwide, Kia sold 1.9 million vehicles in the first eight
months of 2013, up 4.8 percent from a year earlier, according to
a regulatory filing on Sept. 2. The automaker will probably
report a third-quarter profit of 923 billion won, according to
the average of 26 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Earlier this week, union members at Hyundai Motor, South
Korea’s largest automaker, agreed to end a three-week strike
that cost more than 1 trillion won in lost output after they
accepted the carmaker’s proposal to increase wages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
