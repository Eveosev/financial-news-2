Swiss stocks  dropped, with the
benchmark  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  paring its weekly advance, as
investors awaited a report on U.S. retail sales to gauge the
pace of recovery in the worldâ€™s largest economy.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  slipped 1.2 percent, halting a four-day rally as a gauge of European lenders declined.  The Swiss Market Index retreated 0.2 percent to 8,018.5 at
9:37 a.m. in Zurich. The equity benchmark has surged 18 percent
this year as central banks around the world pledged to leave
interest rates low for a prolonged period of time. It has gained
0.9 percent this week. The broader Swiss Performance Index also
fell 0.2 percent today.  U.S. data at 8:30 a.m. in Washington today will probably
show that  retail sales  rose at a faster pace in August.
Purchases climbed 0.5 percent after increasing 0.2 percent in
July, according to the median projection of 84 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The report is one of the last pieces of data before the
 Federal Reserve  meets on Sept. 17-18 to discuss whether to
reduce the pace of its monthly bond purchases. Fed Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  has said that the central bank may consider slowing
stimulus measures if the economy continues to grow in line with
its forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
