Indonesia’s rupiah forwards headed
for their best week since 2009 after the central bank raised
borrowing costs for the fourth time in three months to stem the
currency’s plunge.  Government bonds  rose.  Bank Indonesia  increased the  reference rate  by a quarter of
a percentage point to 7.25 percent yesterday and has boosted by
1.5 percentage points since the middle of June. Global funds
bought $210 million more Indonesian stocks than they sold in the
first four days of this week, exchange data show. The rupiah has
fallen 16 percent in 2013 as investors sold the nation’s assets
because of a record current-account deficit.  One-month non-deliverable forwards surged 4.1 percent this
week, the most since April 2009, to 11,293 per dollar as of
11:55 a.m. in Jakarta, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
contracts fell 0.1 percent today. They were 1.3 percent stronger
than the spot rate, which fell 2.3 percent this week to 11,443,
according to prices from local banks.  “Foreign investors see the rate rise as a good decision,”
said Fahrudin Haris Prastowo, a fixed-income trader at PT Bank
Rakyat  Indonesia  in Jakarta. The increase will draw capital
flows into the country, he said.  Indonesia also raised the deposit facility rate yesterday
to 5.5 percent from 5.25 percent. The nation joins Brazil and
 India  in taking steps to support their currencies as the
prospect of reduced U.S. monetary stimulus prompts investors to
sell emerging-market assets.  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, slid
273 basis points, or 2.73 percentage points, this week to 18
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. A  fixing  used to
settle the forwards was set at 11,174 per dollar today, compared
with 11,694 at the end of last week, according to the
Association of Banks in  Singapore .  The yield on the nation’s 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023
fell 43 basis points this week and 11 basis points today to 8.49
percent, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
