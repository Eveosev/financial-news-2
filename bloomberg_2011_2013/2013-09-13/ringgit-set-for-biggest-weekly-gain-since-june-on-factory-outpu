Malaysia ’s ringgit headed for its
biggest weekly gain since June after the government reported the
fastest industrial production growth in 14 months. Sovereign
bonds advanced.  The currency touched a one-month high yesterday after
official data on Sept. 11 showed  factory output  expanded 7.6
percent in July from a year earlier. The Employees Provident
Fund, which manages more than $170 billion and is Malaysia’s
largest state-owned fund, was a net buyer of the nation’s stocks
during recent declines, Mohamad Nasir Ab. Latif, deputy chief
executive, said in an interview in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.  “The ringgit’s strength this week was helped by the better
than expected industrial output data,” said Wong Chee Seng, a
currency strategist at Ambank Group in  Kuala Lumpur . “The
pension fund’s comment confirmed that local funds are buying and
this will provide support to domestic bonds and stocks.”  The Malaysian currency climbed 1.1 percent this week to
3.2925 per dollar as of 9:32 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, the most
since the five days ended June 28, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. It lost 0.4 percent today and touched 3.2527 yesterday,
the strongest since Aug. 13.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, dropped 32 basis
points, or 0.32 percentage point, to 9.65 percent this week.  Malaysia’s 10-year government bonds climbed for a seventh
day. Yields on the 3.48 percent notes maturing March 2023 fell
11 basis points to 3.84 percent this week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The rate decreased two basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
