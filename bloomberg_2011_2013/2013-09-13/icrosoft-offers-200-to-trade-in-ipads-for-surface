In an effort to entice more
consumers to buy its Surface tablet,  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  is dangling
a new carrot.  The Redmond, Washington-based technology company on Sept.
12 e-mailed and listed on its  website  a promotion that includes
giving credit worth a minimum $200 to customers who turn in
“gently used”  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPads to its stores. The gift card is
for Microsoft stores, and the company suggests upgrading to a
Surface.  The promotion is good through Oct. 27 on the iPad 2, 3 and
4 models, Microsoft said.  Rich Adolph, a spokesman for Microsoft, said the intent of
the initiative wasn’t necessarily a competitive one and was
instead related to a recycling program. “This is part of a
current recycle-for-rewards program,” he said.  Microsoft sold $853 million of Surface tablets in the
fiscal year ended June 30, and took a $900 million writedown of
inventory related to the product. The device, Microsoft’s first-ever computer hardware, is a mobile touch-screen computer
introduced in October to compete with the iPad and tablets
running  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system.  Windows sales have been besieged by poor demand for
personal computers, which will face a 9.7 percent decline this
year, steeper than originally forecast, according to researcher
IDC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
