Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  may supply
EDF Renewable Energy with as much as 750 megawatts of turbines
for U.S. wind farms in 2014 and 2015, the first new deal in the
country announced by the company this year.  Vestas won an order for 80 megawatts of turbines from the
division of  Electricite de France SA (EDF) , and agreed to a “master
supply” deal that may lead to another 670 megawatts of orders,
the Aarhus, Denmark-based company said today in a statement.  The turbine maker last month canceled the planned sale of a
U.S. factory and Chief Marketing Officer Morten Albaek said he
expected the American market to recover in the second half. On
Aug. 22 it said it would supply 400 megawatts to EDP Renovaveis
SA’s U.S. sites under an already-agreed 1,500-megawatt deal.  “Vestas’ factories in  Colorado  will be involved in
manufacturing,” the company said. The farms will use 2-megawatt
V-100 turbines, it said without identifying the projects.  Vestas last year shipped 1,313 megawatts of turbines in the
U.S., more than double its next biggest market of  Germany . An
expiring U.S. tax credit encouraged developers to rush to finish
projects in 2012, leaving a dearth of new work for this year
even after the tax credit was unexpectedly renewed on Jan. 1  The Danish turbine producer has now announced 2,876
megawatts of new orders in 2013, leaving it fewer than 900
megawatts short of its 2012 total of 3,738 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
