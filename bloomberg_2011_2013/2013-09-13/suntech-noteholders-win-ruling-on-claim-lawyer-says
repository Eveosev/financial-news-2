Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) 
noteholders won a court ruling on their claim for $550,000 in
defaulted debt owed by the Chinese solar-cell maker, a lawyer
for the investors said.  U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson Jr. granted the
investors’ motion for summary judgment yesterday at a hearing in
 Manhattan , Jay Teitelbaum, a lawyer for Trondheim Capital
Partners LP and Michael Meixler, said in a phone interview. The
judge instructed the lawyers to prepare a written judgment,
Teitelbaum said. The ruling couldn’t be confirmed on the court’s
website.  The investors sued in New York State Supreme Court in
Manhattan in June and the case was transferred to federal court
in July. They sought a pretrial ruling ordering Wuxi, China-based Suntech to pay $550,000 in principal due on 3 percent 2013
convertible senior notes, plus interest, costs, expenses and
legal fees.  Suntech defaulted in March on $541 million of bonds, and
eight Chinese banks later that month filed a petition for
insolvency and restructuring of the company’s main solar
manufacturing unit, Suntech said in a statement on March 20.  David Barres, a lawyer for Suntech, didn’t immediately
respond to phone and e-mail messages after regular business
hours yesterday seeking comment on the ruling.  The case is Trondheim Capital Partners LP v. Suntech Power
Holdings Co., 13-cv-04668, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
