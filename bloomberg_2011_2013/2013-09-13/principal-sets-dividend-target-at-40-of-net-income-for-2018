Principal Financial Inc., the seller
of life insurance and retirement products, expects about 40
percent of net income to be paid to shareholders through
dividends in 2018 as less capital is needed for organic growth.  The 2018 projection calls for 30 percent to be invested in
organic growth with the remaining 30 percent available for
acquisitions and share buybacks, the Des Moines, Iowa-based
insurer said today in a presentation. Currently, the company
devotes about a third to each of the categories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
