Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures swung
between gains and losses after data showed an unexpected
expansion in industrial production and consumer price growth
holding at almost 10 percent.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for September delivery fell 0.3
percent to 5,855 at 9:55 a.m. in  Singapore  after rising as much
as 0.6 percent. The underlying CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index declined 1.1
percent to 5,850.70 yesterday. The S&P BSE Sensex fell 1.1
percent, paring this week’s gain to 2.7 percent. The Bank of  New
York  Mellon  India  ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares lost 1.7
percent. The rupee snapped its longest winning streak in almost
a year, weakening 0.3 percent to 63.535 per dollar. One-month
rupee  forwards  rose 0.2 percent to 64.35 today.  Indian industrial production strengthened 2.6 percent in
July, compared with the estimated 0.9 percent in a Bloomberg
survey of analysts. The data bolsters new central bank Governor
Raghuram Rajan’s fight against a slumping rupee and slowing
economic growth. Rajan, who reviews  interest rates  for the first
time next week, is under pressure to support the currency and
avoid a surge in import costs that would fuel price pressures.
Consumer prices grew 9.52 percent in August, compared with 9.64
percent the previous month, data showed.  “Fundamentally things haven’t changed much in terms of the
growth outlook and there are still headwinds in terms of growth,
interest rates and inflation,” Mahesh Patil, co-chief
investment officer with Mumbai-based Birla Sun Life Asset
Management Co., which manages $13.8 billion in assets, told
Bloomberg TV India.  Wholesale Prices  Data may show on Sept. 16 that wholesale prices expanded
5.7 percent from a year earlier in August, compared with 5.79
percent in July, according to the median estimate of 20 analysts
in a Bloomberg survey.  The  Reserve Bank  of India meets for its first policy review
under Rajan’s governorship on Sept. 20. Former RBI governor
Duvvuri Subbarao left the benchmark repurchase rate unchanged at
7.25 percent at the previous two meetings. The authority began
tightening monetary policy in July to stem a slide in the
currency that pushed the rupee to a record low on Aug. 28.  The Sensex has increased 1.8 percent this year in local
currency terms and is  valued  at 13.9 times projected 12-month
earnings, compared with the five-year average of 14.1 times,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. It has lost 12 percent this
year in dollar terms. The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index trades at
10.5 times.  Asia ’s third-largest economy may expand 5.5 percent in the
year to March 2014, versus 5 percent in the previous 12-month
period, the weakest pace since 2003, according to central bank
estimates. The 10-year average is about 8 percent.  Overseas investors  bought a net $85 million of domestic
shares on Sept. 11, a fifth straight day of purchases, data from
the regulator show. That boosted this year’s net inflow to $12.3
billion, the second-highest among 10 Asian markets tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
