Further regulatory steps might be
needed to allow big banks to fail without dragging down the
economy, Swiss National Bank President Thomas Jordan said in a
newspaper interview.  “The too-big-to-fail problem isn’t yet fully solved,”
Jordan told Finanz und Wirtschaft in a written interview.  After  UBS AG (UBSN) , the country’s biggest bank, had to be bailed
out by the government in 2008,  Switzerland  implemented capital
standards that exceed the new Basel III rules. UBS and  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  need to hold at least 19 percent of their
assets, weighted according to risk.  “What matters now is that banks implement the relevant
requirements consistently and rapidly,” said Jordan, who
previously headed the SNB’s regulation unit. “Whether
additional measures will be needed depends primarily on whether
the goal of an orderly winding down of major international banks
is achieved.”  To improve their resilience, the SNB instructed UBS and
Credit Suisse in June to improve their leverage rations.  “If the winding down isn’t possible, the buffers will have
to be raised accordingly,” he also said, adding there were
several possibilities, among them contingent-convertible bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
