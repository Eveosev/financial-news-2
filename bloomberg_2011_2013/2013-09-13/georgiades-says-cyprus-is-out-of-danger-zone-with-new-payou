Cypriot Finance Minister Haris
Georgiades said the country is out of the “danger zone” after
the euro area endorsed another disbursement of emergency aid and
Bank of Cyprus Pcl emerged from resolution.  Euro finance chiefs earlier today approved a 1.5 billion-euro ($2 billion) payout to Cyprus, the region’s second transfer
under the Cypriot rescue program. Bank of Cyprus emerged from
resolution in late July after imposing a deposit levy of 47.5
percent.  “We have exited the danger zone,” Georgiades said in an
interview today in Vilnius,  Lithuania , where he took part in a
meeting with his euro-area counterparts. “We are in a phase of
stabilization.”  Cyprus has battled to keep its 10 billion-euro rescue on
track since winning the lifeline in return for pursuing a
tighter budget and forcing losses on uninsured depositors in the
two largest Cypriot banks. Bank of Cyprus absorbed the second-biggest lender, Cyprus Popular Bank Pcl.  To contact the reporter on this story:
