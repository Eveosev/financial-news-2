The ruble weakened against the
Russian central bank’s target basket as oil, the country’s
biggest export earner, declined.  The currency depreciated 0.1 percent versus the dollar-euro
basket to 34.8812 by 7 p.m. in Moscow. It was 0.3 percent lower
at 30.7155 to the dollar and was little changed at 39.9725
against the euro. Yields on benchmark government ruble bonds due
February 2027 added four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point,
to 7.29 percent.  Crude oil futures fell 0.7 percent to $110.87 a barrel in
 London  after a 1.4 percent jump on Tuesday, the strongest one-
day increase since Dec. 26. The ruble continues to trade in a
“tight range” of 34.65 to 35.00 against the basket as Bank
Rossii intervenes to rein in its appreciation and a high current
account limits its weakness, according to  Alfa Bank .  “We need fundamental reasons to drive us out of this
range,” Igor Akinshin, a foreign exchange trader at Alfa Bank,
said by phone.  Bank Rossii is forecast to cut the overnight repurchase
rate from 5.5 percent by a quarter point in the third quarter
after keeping its key borrowing costs unchanged since a quarter-
point increase in September, according to the median of 17
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  President  Vladimir Putin  is considering candidates to head
the central bank as he must name a replacement for Sergey Ignatiev, 65, three months before the current chairman’s third
and final term ends in June.  “Ninety-five percent of market participants, traders,
economists think that whoever is the new head of the central
bank, he immediately lowers the rates,” Akinshin said. “That’s
the fundamental story for the ruble.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
