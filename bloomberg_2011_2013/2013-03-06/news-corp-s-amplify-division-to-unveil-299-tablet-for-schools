News Corp.’s Amplify division, an
education unit run by former  New York  City schools chief Joel Klein, will unveil a $299 tablet computer today that’s designed
for schoolchildren.  The 10-inch device will run on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android
software and use Wi-Fi to provide children with a personalized
learning service, New York-based Amplify said in a  statement .
The company is showcasing the tablet today at the SXSWedu
conference in Austin, Texas.  “Technology has revolutionized the world, but not the
classroom,” Klein, who joined News Corp. in 2011, said in the
statement. “Our hope is that this tablet will help change that.”  The company said it’s working with  AT&T Inc. (T)  to test the
product in school districts across the U.S. The $299 price
requires a two-year subscription at $99 a year. The higher-end
Amplify Tablet Plus costs $349, with a two-year $179 annual
subscription.  The device represents a new revenue source for  News Corp. (NWSA) ,
as well as a bid to challenge Apple Inc.’s dominance in tablets
and educational technology. Klein is spearheading the project
after spending a year leading an internal committee
investigating a hacking scandal at News Corp. He stepped down
from that role last June.  Amplify will join News Corp.’s publishing business when
that company is split off from the Fox entertainment division in
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
