Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell said the central bank “places great importance” on
fighting  money laundering  and terrorist financing.  “When we find problems at a supervised institution, we
demand specific corrective measures, by specific dates, and we
take strong enforcement actions when necessary,” Powell said in
the text of remarks to be delivered to the Senate Banking
Committee tomorrow.  “We will continue these efforts and work cooperatively
with  law enforcement  and other financial regulators to ensure a
coordinated response to the threat posed by illicit financing to
the U.S. financial system,” Powell said in the remarks, which
were obtained by Bloomberg News.  Powell said the Fed “places great importance” on making
sure banks comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and U.S. economic
sanctions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
