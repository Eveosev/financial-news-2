     March 6 (Bloomberg) -- Renewable Energy Corp ASA, the solar
maker grappling with excess capacity, climbed the most in more
than three months in Oslo after polysilicon prices jumped.  Shares in REC, based in Sandvika near Oslo, advanced as
much as 20 percent, the  most since Nov. 29 , and traded 19
percent higher at 1.145 kroner as of 11:20 a.m. local time. More
than 41.4 million shares have been traded so far today, 10
percent more than the three-month daily average volume.  Photovoltaic-grade polysilicon prices  rose 7.1 percent  to
an average of $18 a kilogram (2.2 pounds), researcher PV
Insights said on its website today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
