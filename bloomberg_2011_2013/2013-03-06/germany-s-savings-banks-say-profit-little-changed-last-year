Germany ’s 422 savings banks reported
a combined profit little changed from last year as low interest
rates weighed on income and clients bought fewer securities,
hurting commission revenue.  Net income rose to 2.1 billion euros ($2.7 billion) from 2
billion euros a year earlier, an association representing the
banks said in an e-mailed statement from Berlin today. Net
interest income fell 1.6 percent to 23.2 billion euros while
commissions shrank 0.8 percent to 6.3 billion euros.  “The confusing situation on international financial
markets has led to negative sales of securities -- the overall
volume is 43 percent lower than 2008,” Georg Fahrenschon,
president of the  German Savings Banks Association , or DSGV, said
at a news conference in  Frankfurt , according to the statement.
“It will take a long time until customers are ready for this
again.”  Savings banks had combined assets of 1.1 trillion euros,
the association said. That’s almost twice the 636 billion euros
of Germany’s second-biggest bank  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  and more than
half the 2 trillion euros of Deutsche Bank AG, the country’s
largest lender.  The business model of the savings banks relies on
collecting deposits and lending to companies in their regions.
None of the banks were bailed out during the financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
