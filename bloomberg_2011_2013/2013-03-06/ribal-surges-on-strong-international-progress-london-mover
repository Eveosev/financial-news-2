Tribal Group Plc (TRB)  surged to the
highest since 2008 after the maker of education support software
said 2013 has begun well, following strong international headway
in countries including Australia, and that it expects further
progress.  The  shares  rose 16 percent in  London  to 133.75 pence, the
highest price since September 2008. Tribal was the second- best
performer  in the  FTSE All-Share Index. (ASX)  The volume of shares
traded was more than 10 times the three-month daily average.  Adjusted 2012 pretax profit, at 12.8 million pounds ($19.3
million), will be about 30 percent higher than the median
forecast of 9.9 million pounds of three analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg, as a result of “good progress” with
international contracts, including one in  Australia , the London-
based company said in a statement today.  The headway Tribal made on its Student and Learning
Management contract in New South Wales last year has allowed the
company to recognize extra revenue in 2012, Jonathan Imlah, an
analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said in a note to clients today.  Imlah, who has a buy rating on Tribal, raised his 12-month
price estimate on the stock, which has risen 74 percent in the
past year, to 150 pence from 115 pence.  Full-year 2012 revenue will be in line with company
expectations, Tribal said. Sales will be 113 million pounds,
according to the average of 4 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Tribal is due to release its full 2012 results on March 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
