The yen and pound will decline to
almost four-year lows by year-end versus the dollar on
speculation new central bankers will favor weaker currencies to
encourage economic growth,  UBS AG (UBSN)  said today in a note to
clients.  “A weak yen is a consequence of what Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe and the central bank will be pursuing in monetary policy,”
Larry Hatheway, one of the authors and chief economist at UBS in
London, said in a phone interview. “The challenge for the pound
is that the U.K. can’t sustain a recovery.”  The Zurich-based investment bank forecasts Japan’s currency
to depreciate to 100 yen per  U.S. dollar  by the end of 2013,
from a previous prediction of 85 yen, and for sterling to fall
to $1.41 after an earlier $1.56 estimate. One U.S. dollar last
bought 100 yen in April 2009, while one pound was last worth
$1.41 in March of that same year.  The projections were changed due to a combination of
“domestic monetary policy, official comments seeking lower
exchange rates and trade deficits in Japan and the U.K,” wrote
the authors.  The yen depreciated 0.6 percent against the greenback to
93.89 at 1:13 p.m. in  New York  and the pound fell 0.7 percent to
$1.5023.  The pound weakened for the first time in three days against
the dollar today as 11 of the 39 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg predict the  Bank of England  will increase its asset-
purchase target to at least 400 billion pounds ($604 billion)
from the current 375 billion pounds at the end of its policy
meeting tomorrow.  Carney, Kuroda  The change at the top of the central bank, where Bank of
Canada Governor  Mark Carney  will succeed  Mervyn King  in July,
may result in investor concern whether policy makers will change
the 2 percent inflation target, causing the pound to weaken
further, the authors wrote.  The yen has tumbled 16 percent in the past six months as
Japan’s Abe, who took office in December, pushed for “bold
monetary policy” to weaken the currency and defeat deflation.
New  Bank of Japan (8301)  governor-designate Haruhiko Kuroda may push
for more bond purchases when he replaces Governor Masaaki
Shirakawa later this month, Hatheway said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
