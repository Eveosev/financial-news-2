Coffee extended losses in New York
on speculation investors will continue to sell the futures as
top grower  Brazil  will have an all-time high crop for a lower-
yielding year and as output in  Colombia  recovers. Cocoa fell.  Growers in Brazil will harvest a record crop for a year in
which trees enter the lower-yielding half of a two-year cycle,
according to cooperative Cooparaiso in Sao Sebastiao do Paraiso
in the state of  Minas Gerais . Output in Colombia will rise 30
percent this year, Luis Genaro Munoz, head of the National
Federation of Coffee Growers, estimated.  Small and large speculators excluding  index funds  were net
short, or betting on lower prices, by 32,627 contracts in the
week ended Feb. 26, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s up from a net
short of 14,113 contracts in the week ended Feb. 28 last year.
Investors’ bets on lower prices reached a record in the week
ended Feb. 19.  “Arabica has bearish fundamentals, we know that,” Jerome Jourquin, head of agricultural commodity derivatives at
brokerage Aurel BGC in Paris, said by e-mail today. “There has
been speculation for some time now that funds will buy again but
the problem is that we need a scenario to create an uptrend and
we don’t have it. Any upside move would first generate origins
and merchants selling. I expect the market to trade within a
$1.35 to $1.45 a pound range in the coming weeks.”  Arabica coffee for delivery in May fell 0.2 percent to
$1.408 a pound by 10:56 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .
The commodity retreated as much as 4.2 percent yesterday.
Robusta coffee for delivery in May was down 0.3 percent to
$2,083 a ton on NYSE Liffe in London. Futures trading volumes
were 24 percent lower than the average in the past 100 days for
this time of day.  Brazil Production  Brazil will produce 47 million to 48 million bags of coffee
this year, estimated Francisco Ourique, a manager at Cooparaiso.
That compares with 43.1 million bags harvested in the last off-
year, according to data from Conab, the government’s crop
forecasting agency. Colombian output will gain to 10 million
bags, Munoz said. A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132
pounds).  Prices declined yesterday after “what appears to have been
liquidation of the recent spec longs,” Sucden Financial Ltd.
said in a report, referring to speculators still holding a long
position, or a bet on higher prices. Prices may still fall below
$1.40 a pound, it said.  Raw sugar for May delivery was down 0.2 percent at 18.15
cents a pound in New York. White sugar for May delivery was 0.1
percent lower at $516 a ton in  London .  Cocoa for May delivery slid 0.5 percent to $2,049 a ton on
ICE, and earlier fell as much as 0.7 percent to $2,045, the
lowest price for a most-active contract since June 4. Cocoa for
May delivery fell 0.4 percent to 1,386 pounds ($2,091) a ton on
NYSE Liffe, and declined earlier as much as 0.6 percent to 1,383
pounds, the lowest price since April 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
