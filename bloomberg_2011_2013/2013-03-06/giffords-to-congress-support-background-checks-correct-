(Corrects spelling of Tucson and number wounded.)  Gabrielle Giffords , the former
Democratic congresswoman from Tucson,  Arizona , who was shot in
the head at a 2011 constituent event, urged lawmakers to “be
courageous” and “support background checks.”  Speaking at a press conference at the Safeway Inc. store in
Tucson where she was wounded, Giffords and other survivors of
the shooting urged passage of a measure that would require
universal background checks for gun purchases nationally. Six
people were killed and 12 people besides Giffords were wounded
in the shooting at the store.  To contact the reporter on this story:
