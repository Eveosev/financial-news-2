Nigeria ’s naira depreciated for a
second day, heading for the biggest drop in a week, after the
central bank reduced the amount of dollars sold at an auction
today.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer weakened 0.3
percent, the most since Feb. 27 on a closing basis, to 158.05
per dollar as of 2 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital.  The Central Bank of Nigeria sold $150 million, down from
$234.9 million at the previous sale on March 4, the Abuja-based
bank said in an e-mailed statement. The regulator holds dollar
auctions on Mondays and Wednesdays to help manage the  exchange
rate .  Oil companies , which sell dollars to lenders to meet local
spending needs are the second-biggest source of foreign
currency.  “CBN’s level of intervention wasn’t enough to meet demand
at the  interbank market , as oil industry month-end sales have
declined, after peaking on Monday,” Abubakar Mohammed, chief
executive of Lagos-based Forward Marketing Bureau de Change
Ltd., said by phone today.  The central bank held the benchmark  interest rate  at a
record high 12 percent for an eighth time on Jan. 21 to control
inflation and stabilize the naira. The nation’s inflation rate
fell to 9 percent in January from 12 percent in December, the
statistics bureau said Feb. 18.  Yields on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January
2021 fell 18 basis points to 4.119 percent today.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 rose 16 basis points to 10.76 percent, according to
yesterday’s data compiled on the  Financial Markets Dealers
Association  website.  Ghana ’s cedi was unchanged at 1.9150 per dollar in Accra,
the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
