European soccer’s governing body
will investigate several incidents involving  Manchester United 
at last night’s  Champions League  match with Real Madrid.  UEFA opened disciplinary proceedings into the red card
given to United midfielder Nani during the 2-1 loss at Old
Trafford that eliminated the Premier League leader from the
competition. UEFA will also look into the club’s non-fulfillment
of post-match media obligations after manager  Alex Ferguson  and
players didn’t speak with reporters.  The case will be heard by UEFA’s control and disciplinary
panel on March 21, UEFA said in a statement.  Nani was sent off by referee Cuneyt Cakir for a high
challenge on Alvaro Arbeloa as both contested the ball with
United leading 1-0 in the 56th minute. Real’s Luka Modric and
Cristiano Ronaldo would later score three minutes apart to give
Real a 3-2 win over two matches.  Ferguson was incensed when the red card was given,
immediately charging from his seat to complain to the fourth
official on the touchline.  He then skipped his press conference, with assistant coach
Mike Phelan taking his place and saying the manager was not in
“any fit state” to talk, while United players also weren’t
made available to the media.  To contact the reporter on this story:
