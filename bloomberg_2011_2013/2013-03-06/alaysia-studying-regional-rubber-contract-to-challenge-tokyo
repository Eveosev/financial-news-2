Malaysia is studying a rubber
futures contract to compete with  Tokyo  as a benchmark, the head
of the country’s derivatives exchange said.  Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Bhd., part-owned by CME Group
Inc. and a unit of  Bursa Malaysia Bhd. (BURSA) , is talking to producers
and traders in Southeast Asia to assess the feasibility, Chief
Executive Officer Chong Kim Seng said in an interview today.  “Among the producing areas, there is currently no good
benchmark yet,” Chong said at the Palm and Lauric Oils
Conference and Exhibition in Kuala Lumpur today. “Over 75
percent of rubber comes out of Southeast Asia. This is something
that seems to be lacking.”  Malaysia wants to broaden its range of financial products
after establishing itself as the largest center for palm oil
trading and  Islamic finance . The Tokyo Commodity Exchange is
home to the most popular benchmark for rubber futures. Contracts
are also traded in Shanghai and Singapore.  A Malaysian rubber contract would probably also trade on
the CME’s Globex electronic platform, said Chong. The bourse is
looking at a futures contract for refined, bleached and
deodorized palm olein, he said, without providing a timeframe.  Options trading on crude palm oil futures started on July
16, becoming the first Asian exchange-traded agricultural
options contract, the exchange said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
