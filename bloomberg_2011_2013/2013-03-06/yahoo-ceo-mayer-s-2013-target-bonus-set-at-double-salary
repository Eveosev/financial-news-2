Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  paid Chief Executive
Officer  Marissa Mayer  a bonus of $1.12 million in 2012, adding
to her pay because the company met its targets for revenue and
operating margins.  Though Mayer, who left  Google Inc. (GOOG)  to join Yahoo in July,
received a prorated bonus for working less than a full year, her
compensation was increased because the company topped its
expectations, Sara Gorman, a spokeswoman at Sunnyvale,
California-based Yahoo, said yesterday in an e-mail.  Yahoo shares have surged more than 40 percent since the
hiring of Mayer, who recorded the company’s first annual sales
increase in four years in 2012. The CEO has updated Yahoo’s home
page, revamped its mail and Flickr applications and announced
plans to return cash to shareholders through buybacks.  Mayer will receive a salary of $1 million and a target
bonus of twice that amount this year, unchanged from last year,
the company said yesterday in a filing with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission.  She stands to receive more than $50 million in compensation
over the coming years, including $12 million in restricted stock
units and  stock options , $30 million in one-time retention
awards and $14 million to make up for stock-based compensation
she would have received at Google, the company said in a filing
last year.  Chief Financial Officer Kenneth Goldman’s target bonus was
set at 90 percent of his 2013 base pay of $600,000, which was
also kept the same, according to today’s filing.  Bonuses will be determined by operating income, free cash
flow and revenue, excluding costs to attract Web traffic,
according to the filing.  Yahoo shares fell less than 1 percent to $22.80 yesterday
at the close in  New York . They have gained 58 percent in the
past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
