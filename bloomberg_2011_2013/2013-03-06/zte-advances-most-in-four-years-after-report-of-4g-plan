ZTE Corp. (000063) ,  China ’s second-largest
maker of phone network equipment,  jumped  the most in more than
four years in  Hong Kong  trading after a report on approval for
fourth-generation service spurred speculation carriers will
boost spending.  ZTE climbed 8.9 percent, the most since Jan. 29, 2009, to
close at HK$14.14 in Hong Kong. The company’s Shenzhen-traded
stock climbed 10 percent, the biggest advance since it started
trading in November 1997.  The government may issue licenses for fourth-generation
wireless service this year, China Securities Journal reported
today, citing Minister of Industry and Information Technology
Miao Wei. The timing will be determined by the expansion of a
trial by China Mobile Communications Corp., the report said.  “ZTE is a big beneficiary to the  capex  upside both this
year and next year,” Cynthia Meng, a Hong Kong-based analyst
with Jefferies Group Inc., wrote in an e-mail today, referring
to increased spending by mobile-phone operators. She recommends
buying the shares.  The company also said it has entered into a “strategic
collaboration” with  Intel Corp. (INTC)  for next-generation smartphones
based on the new Atom Processor Z2580. Phones with the new
processor will double the computing performance and have as much
as three times the graphics capabilities of the previous
generation processor while maintaining the same battery life,
ZTE said in a statement dated yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
