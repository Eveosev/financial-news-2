Twelve banks in the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council had about $4 billion of their Tier II bonds
placed on watch for a possible downgrade at Moody’s Investors
Service due to new capital rules that may come into effect.  While government support for banks in the GCC monarchies is
high, the review of these debt ratings is “driven by the
growing risk of bail-ins for subordinated debt instruments,”
Moody’s said in an e-mailed statement today.  Bail-ins provide governments with an alternative to
taxpayer-funded rescue of banks. Claims of subordinated
creditors and even some senior creditors may be written-down in
a bail-in to stabilise a bank that may be facing insolvency.  The banks affected are  Arab National Bank (ARNB) ,  Banque Saudi
Fransi (BSFR) ,  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB) ,  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) ,  First
Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB) ,  Mashreqbank PSC (MASQ) ,  Commercial Bank of Qatar QSC (CBQK) ,
 Doha Bank QSC (DHBK) ,  Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) ,  Burgan Bank SAK (BURG) , Bank
Muscat SAOG and and BBK B.S.C., according to Moody’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
