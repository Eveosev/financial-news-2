Philippine  stocks  rose, driving up
the benchmark index the most in a month on speculation more
companies will join Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. in
reporting higher earnings.  PLDT (TEL) , the nation’s biggest company by market value, rose to
a five-year high, adding to a 2.3 percent gain yesterday after
it posted a sixfold jump in quarterly profit.  Aboitiz Power
Corp. (AP) , which reports earnings today, increased 1.9 percent.
 Ayala Land Inc. (ALI)  climbed 5.1 percent, leading gains among
developers, after the Philippine Daily Inquirer reported rising
real-estate demand is fueling property inventories.  “The earnings coming out have been good and so far there
has been no major disappointment, giving the market support,”
Allan Yu, who helps manage the equivalent of $10.9 billion as a
fund manager at Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co., said by phone.  The  Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PCOMP)  jumped 1.7 percent to
6,824.30 as of the noon break in Manila. The measure is poised
for its biggest advance since Feb. 4. The gauge climbed 17
percent this year, the most among the largest Asian benchmark
indexes, amid expectations economic growth will accelerate and
the nation will win an investment-grade  credit rating .  The Philippine gauge climbed 294 percent since October 2008
through March 5, making it the world’s biggest equity bull
market. That’s at least 134 percentage points more than every
other bull market in emerging and developed nations, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
