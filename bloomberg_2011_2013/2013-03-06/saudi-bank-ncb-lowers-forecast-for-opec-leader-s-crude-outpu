Saudi Arabia ’s crude oil output this
year may average 400,000 barrels a day less than in 2012 as the
kingdom curbs supply to help meet OPEC’s production target,
according to a  National Commercial Bank  forecast.  The world’s largest crude exporter may pump 9.5 million
barrels a day on average in 2013, Saudi Arabia’s biggest lender
by assets said today in an e-mailed note. NCB reduced its
estimate for Saudi production this year from its previous
forecast, in November, of 10.1 million barrels.  The Jeddah-based bank expects Arab Light grade, which
accounts for about half of Saudi Arabia’s total output, to sell
this year at a minimum price of $80 a barrel and at an average
of $105. Brent crude futures have averaged $113.76 a barrel this
year and traded today at $110.86 at 3:17 p.m. in  London .  The biggest producer in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will need to sell its crude at an average
minimum price of $72.80 this year to balance its annual budget,
compared with $67 in 2012, NCB estimates. The bank forecasts the
Saudi break-even price will rise to $75.20 in 2014.  The kingdom may generate revenue of $324 billion from oil
exports this year, down from last year’s record of $347.6
billion, NCB said.  OPEC’s 12 members trimmed output by 21,000 barrels a day to
30.32 million in January, according to the group’s latest
monthly market report published Feb. 13. The group, which
supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil, has an official
production ceiling of 30 million barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
