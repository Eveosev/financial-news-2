LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) , the biggest online
professional-networking service, won dismissal of a lawsuit
claiming it failed to follow industry standards and its own
promises in encrypting user password information.  The lawsuit, filed last year in federal court in  San Jose ,
 California , followed the company’s website being hacked and 6.5
million member passwords being posted on an unrelated website.
In June, LinkedIn confirmed its site was hacked. The suit was
based on alleged violations of California consumer protection
statutes, breach of contract and negligence claims.  In dismissing the case, U.S. District Judge Edward J. Davila said the plaintiffs didn’t read LinkedIn’s allegedly
misrepresented privacy policy, which is necessary to support
their claims.  The plaintiffs haven’t demonstrated they have standing to
bring the lawsuit, Davila said, because they failed to
demonstrate a “causal connection” between  Mountain View ,
California-based LinkedIn’s alleged misrepresentation and their
harm, according to yesterday’s ruling.  Jay Edelson, a lawyer representing plaintiffs in the case,
didn’t immediately return a call yesterday after regular
business hours seeking comment on the ruling.  The case is In re LinkedIn User Privacy Litigation, 12-
cv-03088, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
