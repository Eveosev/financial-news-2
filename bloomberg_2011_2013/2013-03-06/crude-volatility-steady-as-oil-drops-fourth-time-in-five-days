Crude options volatility was little
changed as oil futures fell for the fourth time in five days.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 20.06 percent at 3:35 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , up from 19.92 yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery fell 39
cents to settle at $90.43 a barrel on the Nymex. Prices have
slid 7.7 percent from a year-to-date high of $97.94 on Jan. 30.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
June $110 calls, which declined 2 cents to 11 cents a barrel on
volume of 4,299 contracts. April $92 calls were the second-most
active with 2,675 lots. They slipped 18 cents to 49 cents a
barrel.  Calls accounted for 55 percent of electronic trading
volume. In the previous session, puts made up 52 percent of the
126,495 contracts traded.  April $85 puts were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 7,050 contracts changing hands. They fell 15
cents to 10 cents a barrel. April $82 puts declined 6 cents to 3
cents on 5,579 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $105 calls with
36,271 contracts. Next were April $110 calls at 34,205 and June
$90 puts at 30,598.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
