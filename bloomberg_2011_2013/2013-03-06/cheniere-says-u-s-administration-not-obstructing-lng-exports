Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG)  praised the
U.S. government’s approach to evaluating proposals for natural
gas exports as the company moved ahead with plans to expand its
shipping terminal at Sabine Pass in Louisiana.  President  Barack Obama ’s administration has done a “very
good job” dealing with the complicated matter of exporting
liquefied natural gas, known as LNG, Cheniere Chief Executive
Officer Charif Souki told reporters at the IHS CERAWeek energy
conference in Houston today.  Sabine Pass is the only project so far to obtain full U.S.
approval for an LNG export terminal outside of  Alaska .  “We have clearly a lot of supply and not enough demand,”
Souki said. “They’ve been very measured with the steps they’ve
taken, but they’re not at all being obstructionist.”  The U.S. has started to increase its presence on the global
market to reassure potential investors and buyers that
“logical” results will come out of the process, he said. The
number of export terminals approved will depend on how many
parties put in the time and money needed to make their projects
a success, he said.  Cheniere has said its proposed gas export facility at
Sabine Pass may start up in 2015, with possibly six units
operating there in the future. The company also proposes to
export gas from a facility near  Corpus Christi , Texas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
