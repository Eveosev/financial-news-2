U.S. Silver & Gold Inc., a producer
of silver in Montana and  Idaho , said private-equity firms are
interested in helping finance acquisitions of precious-metals
projects.  The company, which currently is focused on studying and
developing its own assets, may be ready to start looking for
purchases by around mid-year, Chief Executive Officer Darren Blasutti said. Private-equity firms, drawn by cheap mining-
company valuations, are “all talking about precious metals
now,” he said in an interview yesterday at the Prospectors &
Developers Association of Canada convention in Toronto.  “We probably have four or five guys that would put
somewhere between $50 million and $100 million into a deal,”
Blasutti said. “They need us as a management team to build, we
need their capital, valuations are cheap, so I think you’re
going to see more of that happen.”  U.S. Silver & Gold was formed last year when U.S. Silver
Corp. bought RX Gold & Silver Inc. in a C$31.5 million ($30.6
million) all-stock deal. The company expects to increase
production from its existing assets from 2.6 million ounces of
silver last year to an annual rate of more than 5 million ounces
by the end of 2015, Blasutti said.  U.S. Silver & Gold dropped 1.3 percent to C$1.48 at 11:45
a.m. in Toronto. The shares have fallen 56 percent in the past
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
