Deere & Co. (DE) , the world’s largest
agricultural-equipment  maker , sold $1 billion of bonds through
its finance unit with an offering of fixed- and floating-rate
securities.  John Deere Capital issued $600 million of two-year
floating-rate notes that pay 7 basis points more than the London
interbank offered  rate  and $400 million of five-year, 1.3
percent bonds that yield 55 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The unit’s $500 million of 5.35 percent debentures due
April 2018 traded at 119 cents on the dollar on Feb. 11 to yield
1.5 percent, or 66 basis points more than benchmarks, according
to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority.  Libor, the rate at which banks say they can borrow from one
another, is the standard for about $360 trillion of financial
products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
