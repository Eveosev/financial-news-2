Taxpayers claimed 7.3 percent less
in mortgage interest deductions in 2011 compared with 2010,
according to  preliminary data  released by the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service.  Declining home values and lower interest rates may have
contributed to the decline, the tax agency said in a report
today. In 2011, 36 million taxpayers deducted $358.8 billion in
home mortgage interest, down from 2010, when 36.9 million
taxpayers deducted $387.1 billion.  U.S. taxpayers can generally deduct mortgage interest on
indebtedness up to $1 million and $100,000 in home equity loans
on their primary and secondary residences. The break is
available only to the 31.8 percent of taxpayers who itemize
their deductions.  Use of the mortgage interest deduction declined even as
income and other deductions increased during the economic
recovery in 2011.  Adjusted gross income rose 3.1 percent to $8.3 trillion.
Use of the student loan interest deduction increased by 5.7
percent, to $9.8 billion. Use of the deduction for charitable
contributions increased 1.4 percent, to $160.3 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
