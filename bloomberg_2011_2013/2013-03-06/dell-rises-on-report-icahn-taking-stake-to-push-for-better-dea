Dell Inc. (DELL)  rose as much as 3.1
percent after CNBC reported that investor  Carl Icahn  has amassed
a stake of as much as 6 percent in the computer maker and will
probably oppose a proposed $24.4 billion leveraged buyout by
Michael Dell and Silver Lake Management LLC.  Icahn will probably push for a special dividend, CNBC
reported, citing people it didn’t name.  Dell advanced 2 percent to $14.35 at 2:44 p.m. in New York,
and earlier touched $14.51 for the biggest intraday gain since
Feb. 1. Through yesterday, the stock had declined 19 percent in
the past 12 months, compared with a 12 percent gain in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Michael Dell  and Silver Lake announced a deal on Feb. 5 to
take Dell private with an offer of $13.65 a share in the largest
leveraged buyout since the financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
