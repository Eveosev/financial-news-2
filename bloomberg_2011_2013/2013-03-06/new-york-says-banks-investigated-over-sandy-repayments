New York  State’s banking regulator
is investigating whether lenders improperly demanded repayment
from homeowners who were allowed to skip mortgage payments in
the aftermath of superstorm Sandy.  The Department of Financial Services is asking lenders to
allow more time for homeowners to make back payments and
reviewing whether the firms kept a promise not to start
foreclosure proceedings in certain cases, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo said today in a  statement . He didn’t name the banks.  “Major banks” and loan servicers agreed last year to
waive payments for three to six months for borrowers affected by
the storm, and said they wouldn’t demand balloon payments later,
according to the statement. Some homeowners have since told the
regulator that they are being asked for full lump-sum payments.  “We are investigating to determine if the complaints we
have received are isolated incidents or part of a disturbing
trend,”  Benjamin Lawsky , superintendent of financial services,
said in the statement. “Banks can’t just say they will help
homeowners hurt by Sandy. They must deliver.”  Sandy struck the U.S. East Coast in October, killing more
than 100 people and damaging homes, cars and businesses. It
caused as much as $25 billion in insured losses, according to
modeler Risk Management Solutions Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
