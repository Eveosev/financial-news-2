U.S. Geothermal Inc. (HTM) , a renewable-
energy developer with projects in three Western states and
Guatemala, received the balance of a Treasury Department grant
of $11.8 million for a project in Nevada.  “This seems to be another item USG is crossing off the to-
do list as it ties up loose ends in the U.S., in preparation to
focus full attention on its project-development interests
outside the U.S.,”  Mark Taylor , a Bloomberg New Energy Finance
analyst based in Washington, said in an e-mail today.  The company’s Nevada unit had received $10.7 million as of
Nov. 15, according to a statement today. The San Emidio facility
is projected to generate 75,000 megawatt hours annually. During
January and February it produced more than 6,100 megawatt hours
a month to sell to Sierra Pacific Power Co. under a 25-year
agreement.  U.S. Geothermal is developing a project about nine miles
(14 kilometers) from  Guatemala City , and “discussions and
planning are under way for the development of a power-purchase
agreement,” according to the Boise, Idaho-based company’s
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
