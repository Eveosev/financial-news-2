Italy ’s government bonds advanced
for a second day as optimism the global economy is recovering
boosted demand for higher-yielding assets.  The nation’s  10-year yields  dropped to the lowest level
since inconclusive parliamentary elections on Feb. 24-25, as
concern eased that political paralysis will drive up borrowing
costs. Spain’s 10-year securities rose for a sixth day, the
longest run of gains since August, as the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average (INDU)  extended a record high. German bunds were little changed
before the  European Central Bank  sets  interest rates  tomorrow.  “It seems that investors have decided to hold on to
Italian bonds and wait and see,” said Allan von Mehren, chief
analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen. “They are being
supported by generally good risk sentiment and stock markets
have been doing pretty well the last couple of days, so that’s
underpinning the bounce in Italy and Spain.”  Italy’s 10-year yields fell eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 4.66 percent at 4:43 p.m.  London  time,
after reaching 4.59 percent. The rate dropped 14 basis points
yesterday. The 5.5 percent security maturing in November 2022
gained 0.61, or 6.10 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,300) face amount,
to 106.88.  Yields on Italy’s 10-year bonds jumped to 4.96 percent on
Feb. 27, the most since November, after the election produced a
hung parliament, threatening political paralysis and a reversal
of outgoing Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s austerity measures.  The Dow rose for a fourth day, gaining as much 0.5 percent
to 14.320.65.  Bond Movers  Volatility on Italy’s bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets, followed by those of  Finland  and the Netherlands,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Italy is preparing to sell new 30-year bonds,Maria Cannata, head of the nation’s debt agency, said today at the
Euromoney Bond Investors Congress in London.  The  bond market  reacted “quite well” to the elections,
she said. “The market is convinced a good solution will be
found, even if the situation is quite complex now.”  Spain  may sell new 10-year bonds via banks as soon as mid-
year, and is considering a new 15-year security, deputy debt
chief Ignacio Fernandez-Palomero Morales told reporters at the
same conference.  Yields on Spanish 10-year bonds fell three basis points to
5.01 percent. The rate has fallen from 5.59 percent on Feb. 26,
the highest level since Dec. 10.  Spain is scheduled to sell a total of 5 billion euros of
bonds maturing in two, five and 10 years tomorrow. It last
auctioned the 10-year securities on Feb. 21 at an average yield
of 5.20 percent.  Economy Contracts  German bunds erased an earlier decline as a report showed
the euro-area  economy  contracted the most in almost four years
in the fourth quarter, boosting the case for more monetary
stimulus from the ECB, which next decides on policy tomorrow.  Gross domestic product  in the 17-nation bloc fell 0.6
percent from the third quarter, the European Union’s statistics
office in Luxembourg said today, confirming an initial estimate
published on Feb. 14. The economy has  shrunk  for three quarters,
a trend that will continue in the first three months of 2013,
according to a separate Bloomberg survey.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yielded 1.46 percent after rising as
much as three basis points. The nation auctioned an additional
3.1 billion euros of five-year notes at an average yield of 0.45
percent. It last sold the securities on Feb. 6 at 0.68 percent.  The ECB will maintain its benchmark interest rate at a
record-low 0.75 percent at tomorrow’s meeting, according to the
median estimate of 61 economists in a  Bloomberg survey .  French Auctions  France ’s 30-year bonds fell for a second day as the
nation’s debt agency said it’s considering selling a new
benchmark. The yield on the 4.5 percent securities maturing in
April 2041 climbed three basis points to 3.18 percent.  France may sell new 30-year bonds, Maya Atig, deputy chief
executive of Agence France Tresor, said at the Euromoney
conference.  The Paris-based debt agency is due to sell as much as a
combined 7.5 billion euros of 2018, 2022 and 2027 bonds
tomorrow.  Italian bonds returned 6.7 percent in the 12 months through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bunds gained 3.8 percent, the indexes showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
