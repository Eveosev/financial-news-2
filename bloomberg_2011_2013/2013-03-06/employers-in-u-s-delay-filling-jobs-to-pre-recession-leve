U.S. employers are filling job
vacancies at the slowest pace since July 2007, when the economy
was sliding toward its last recession, an analysis of government
data showed.  While  job openings  have risen for more than three years,
the average time to fill a position rose to 23 days in December
2012, from a low of 15.4 in July 2009, according to an analysis
of Labor Department data by Jason Faberman, a senior economist
in the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s research department;
Steven J. Davis, an economics professor at the University of
Chicago’s Booth School of Business; and economics professor John
Haltiwanger at the University of Maryland, in College Park.  “Employers don’t need to be in a particular hurry to hire
workers because many opportunities are coming along,” Davis
said in an interview today. “Many potential candidates are
coming along, so they can wait till they get a good candidate,
they know that if they don’t hire a candidate today, they will
probably have more candidates to choose from in the future.”  U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 0.1 percent annual
rate in the fourth quarter, government data showed last month,
as the smallest trade deficit in almost three years helped
overcome the biggest plunge in  defense spending  since the
Vietnam War era.  To contact the reporter on this story:
