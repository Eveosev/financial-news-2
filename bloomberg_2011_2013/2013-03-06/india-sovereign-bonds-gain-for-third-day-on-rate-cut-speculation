Indian government  bonds  gained for a
third day on speculation the central bank will cut borrowing
costs this month to revive an economy growing at the slowest
pace in almost four years.  Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said on March 4 he
hopes  interest rates  will be cut after official data last week
showed gross domestic product increased 4.5 percent last quarter
from a year earlier. The  Reserve Bank  of India lowered the
repurchase  rate  by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent on Jan. 29,
the first reduction in nine months. The next policy review is
due on March 19.  “The RBI is certain to cut rates to address growth
concerns,” said N.S. Venkatesh, Mumbai-based head of treasury
at state-run  IDBI Bank Ltd. (IDBI)  “That expectation is driving yields
lower.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 fell one
basis point to 7.86 percent in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. The rate has dropped five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, this week.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was little
changed at 7.58 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
