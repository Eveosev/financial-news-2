Former New York Knicks guard Ray
Williams is being treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center for an undisclosed illness, the New York Daily News
reported.  Williams, 58, played for the Knicks during five of his 10
National Basketball Association seasons from 1977 to 1987. He
also had two stints with the New Jersey Nets.  The Daily News reported in 2011 that doctors discovered a
large tumor in Williamsâ€™s colon after he became the first ex-
player to take advantage of a free colon-cancer screening
offered through the NBA Retired Players Association.  Madison Square Garden Co. (MSG)  Chairman James Dolan paid for him
to be flown to New York from  Florida  for the current treatment.  Williams was homeless and living in a 1992 Buick as
recently as two years ago, the newspaper said. Williams, who was
born in Mount Vernon, New York, entered the NBA with the Knicks
as the 10th pick in the 1977 draft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
