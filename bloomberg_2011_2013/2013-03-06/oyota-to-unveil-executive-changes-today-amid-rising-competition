Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s
largest automaker, will announce  management  changes today at a
press conference attended by President Akio Toyoda amid rising
global competition.  The briefing will be held at 4:30 p.m. in  Tokyo , the
company said in an e-mailed statement. Executive Vice President
Atsushi Niimi will leave his role overseeing  North America  and
China in the reshuffle, the Nikkan Kogyo newspaper reported
today, without saying where it got the information.  Toyota, which regained the world’s-largest carmaker title
in 2012, is making the changes as competition intensifies in the
U.S. and it faces a consumer backlash in China over a
territorial dispute with  Japan . A weakening yen has helped drive
its stock about 21 percent higher this year, outperforming the
15 percent advance in the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  Toyota Senior Managing Officers Yasumori Ihara and Seiichi
Sudo will be promoted, according to the Nikkan Kogyo report.  Toyota is making the changes as part of an initiative by
Toyoda to speed decision making and free executive vice
presidents to concentrate on strategic thinking, leaving daily
decisions to more junior managers, Reuters reported yesterday,
citing a person familiar with the plan.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
