Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU)  fell in  New York  after
denying a report that it’s looking to go private, while
 Guangshen Railway Co. (GSH)  led gains in Chinese stocks on government
plans to build new railway lines.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. was little changed at 93.9
yesterday, as 29 stocks rose and 26 fell. Sohu had the biggest
tumble in a year and Internet security software provider Qihoo
360 Technology Co. dropped 7.6 percent after Jefferies Group LLC
downgraded the stock. Guangshen surged to the highest level
since 2008 while  Ambow Education Holding Ltd. (AMBO)  rallied the most
since September.  Sohu soared 12 percent March 5 in New York as the  South
China Morning Post  reported the company was talking to
investment banks and private equity funds about a potential
buyout. The Beijing-based company fell yesterday after saying
it’s currently not considering privatization. Sohu, which
services range from online news, games to web search and video,
is down 8.2 percent this year, after slumping a combined 25
percent in 2011 and 2012.  “The market is giving back almost all gains yesterday
following that report on its privatization talks,” David Riedel, president of Riedel Research Group Inc., said in a phone
interview in New York yesterday. “Sohu’s business model is more
complicated and harder for investors to understand because of
its different operations.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., advanced 0.7 percent to
$38.50, rising for a second day. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
was little changed at 1,541.46 as the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  extended gains to a record high.  Sohu’s Plunge  Sohu dropped 11 percent to $43.44 in New York, the biggest
slump since February 2012. Its online games unit  Changyou.com
Ltd. (CYOU)  also fell 8.3 percent to $29.55. Sohu’s shares have plunged
64 percent from a record high of $106.28 reached in April 2011.  Qihoo’s American depositary receipts sank to $32.19, the
steepest retreat since May. Its ADRs have climbed 8.4 percent
this year after surging 89 percent in 2012. The company  traded 
at 33 times estimated profit, the highest level since October
2011.  The company, which started an online search engine last
year, saw profit margin drop to 12.4 percent in the fourth
quarter from 24.1 percent as efforts to expand its search and
mobile Internet business raised costs, Beijing-based Qihoo said
in a March 5 statement. The margin will “see the bottom” in
the first quarter before gradually improving, Chief Executive
Officer Alex Xu said in an earnings conference call.  ‘Rich’ Valuation  Jefferies cut the rating on the stock to hold, the
equivalent of neutral, from buy, citing slower profit growth and
“rich” valuation. She also reduced its price target by 18
percent to $31.  Qihoo’s fourth-quarter net income of $12.8 million beat the
$7 million mean  forecast  of eight analysts compiled by
Bloomberg, and sales of $103 million also exceeded the $93.8
million predicted by analysts.  Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS) , an online fashion discounter based
in Guangzhou, slipped 6.6 percent to a two-week low of $23.58.
The slump trimmed its gain this year to 32 percent.  Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities Co., Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.’s China partner, lowered Vipshop’s price target by 5
percent to $31.7 on March 5.  Youku Tudou Inc. (YOKU) , operator of China’s largest video
websites, slumped 6.8 percent to this year’s low of $18.  Sina
Corp. (SINA) , owner of China’s largest Twitter-like service, slid 3.8
percent to $48.55, also the lowest price this year.  Railway Plans  Guangshen Railway, which runs the only train line linking
mainland China to  Hong Kong , soared 7.5 percent to $26.34, the
highest level since May 2008. Trading volume on the stock was
three times the daily average over the past three months, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  China aims to open more than 5,200 kilometers (3,232 miles)
of new railway lines and build 80,000 kilometers of highways
this year, according to a report by China’s top planning agency
posted on the government’s website on March 5.  Ambow, a Beijing-based tutoring services provider, jumped
7.6 percent to $1.13, the largest gain since September. Ambow’s
ADRs had slid 38 percent over nine days to a record low of $1.05
on March 5.  NQ Mobile Inc. (NQ) , a security service provider for mobile
phones, climbed 3.2 percent to an eight-month high of $8.77.  The Beijing-based company boosted its sales forecast for
2013 to as much as $183 million, from $155 million previously,
in a statement after markets yesterday.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  jumped 1.7 percent to
11,359.04 yesterday in a second day of gains, while the Shanghai
Composite Index of domestic Chinese shares added 0.9 percent to
a three-day high of 2,347.18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
