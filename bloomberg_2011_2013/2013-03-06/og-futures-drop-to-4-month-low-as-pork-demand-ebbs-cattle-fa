Hog futures dropped to a four-month
low on speculation that U.S. meat processors will slow animal
purchases after an increase in slaughter rates eroded pork
prices. Cattle also declined.  A wholesale hog carcass weighing 200 pounds (91 kilograms)
plunged 2.2 percent yesterday to 79.89 cents a pound, the
biggest drop in three weeks and the lowest since Sept. 26,
government data show. Meatpackers slaughtered 854,000 hogs in
the first two days of this week, up 1.5 percent from a year
earlier, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  “Pessimism about pork demand and rising slaughter rates
are a double negative for hogs,” Greg Grow, the director of
agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said
in a telephone interview. “Packer demand for hogs will slow
until pork demand improves.”  Hog futures for April settlement declined 0.4 percent to
78.9 cents a pound at 9:53 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after reaching 78.25 cents, the lowest for the most-
active contract since Nov. 7. Prices are down 12 percent since
the end of January.  Cattle futures for April delivery fell 1.1 percent to
$1.282 a pound on the CME, heading for the biggest drop since
Jan. 17.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement dropped 1.5
percent to $1.43975 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
