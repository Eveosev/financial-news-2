Rovi Corp. (ROVI) , a provider of digital
home-entertainment products, entered a licensing agreement with
online video service Hulu LLC, resolving all litigation between
the two companies.  Terms of the agreement won’t be disclosed, Linda Quach, a
spokeswoman for Santa Clara, California-based Rovi, said in a
phone interview. She declined to comment further on the
resolution of the case, announced in an e-mailed statement.  Rovi sued Hulu in 2011 in federal court in Wilmington,
Delaware, claiming infringement of patents covering interactive
television functions. Rovi claimed Los Angeles-based Hulu was
wrongly using protected technology for electronic programming
guides, according to the suit.  Hulu is owned by  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) , News Corp., and  Comcast
Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC Universal. A Hulu representative didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail
seeking comment on the agreement.  The case is Rovi Corp. v. Hulu LLC, 1:11-cv-00665, U.S.
District Court, District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
