Ghana ’s failure to narrow its budget
deficit more quickly may add to debt, threatening a credit
downgrade, Fitch Ratings said.  Plans announced yesterday to narrow the gap to 9 percent of
gross domestic product in the 2013 fiscal year from 12.1 percent
last year place the nation’s rating of B+ at risk of a cut,
 Carmen Altenkirch , a London-based sovereign analyst at Fitch,
said in an e-mailed note today. Fitch expected the government to
close the gap to 8 percent and 5 percent next year. The deficit
ballooned last year from a revised estimate of 6.7 percent in
July. The rating is four levels below investment grade.  “Failure to stick to the budget’s less-than-ambitious
fiscal consolidation plan will further increase concerns about
Ghana’s long-term creditworthiness,” Altenkirch said. “Failure
to set out and implement a credible consolidation plan and
improve expenditure control could lead to a downgrade.”  Fitch placed a negative outlook on the oil producer’s
credit rating last month, indicating a cut on the rating may
happen if fiscal conditions don’t improve. Increases in
government salaries, higher interest costs to pay debt and
spending ahead of December elections eroded the government’s
ability to narrow the deficit, Fitch said.  The economy will expand 8 percent this year and 8.7 percent
next year, Finance Minister Seth Terkper said yesterday as he
presented his budget to lawmakers in  Accra .  To contact the reporter on this story:
