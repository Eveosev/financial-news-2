IDB Development Corp.’s 2018  bonds 
soared, pushing the yield down the most in more than two weeks,
after the debt-strapped Israeli  investment company  sold its
stake in  Clal Industries Ltd. (CII)  to boost funding.  The yield on IDB’s 2.12 billion shekels ($569 million) of
4.5 percent notes maturing June 2018 dropped 56 basis points, or
0.56 percentage point, the most since Feb. 18, to 19.42 percent,
at 1:56 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The yield on the 4.25 percent
benchmark government bonds due in March 2023, was unchanged at
3.91 percent.  IDB Development said today it may post profit of 22 million
shekels this month from the 223 million-shekel sale of its 10.6
percent stake in Clal Industries to an unnamed institutional
investor. Its bondholders last week authorized their joint
representative to act on debt restructuring and to take legal
steps as necessary as the company’s parent  IDB Holding Corp. (IDBH) 
strives to avoid a default.  “The deal provides some liquidity for the company as the
holders particularly of its longer-term debt are concerned that
there won’t be enough funds left to pay back debt,” said Raz Mor, a corporate debt analyst at DS Securities & Investments
Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “Still the sale is fairly small and will not
do much to solve the debt problems at the parent company.”  Standard & Poor’s Maalot in January cut the company’s
rating by three grades to ilB, five levels below investment
grade, citing “weak” funding and unsustainable high leverage.
The company may fall 1 billion shekels short of cash to cover
debt and costs in 2014, S&P said. The yield on IDB Development’s
2018 notes soared 13.7 percentage points last year.  Discounted Price  IDB Holding shares fell 0.2 percent to 11.99 shekels. Clal
Industries  shares  fell 2 percent, the most in a week, to 14.70
shekels after IDB Development sold its stake at 13.3 shekels per
share. Trading was almost 20 times the three-month average daily
volume.  The  Tel Aviv  Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, rose less than 0.1 percent to
284.95, the highest on record. The shekel strengthened for a
second day, gaining 0.1 percent to 3.7262 to a dollar.  The two-year break-even rate, the difference between yields
on inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government notes of
similar maturity, increased two basis points to 243 basis
points, implying an average annual inflation rate of 2.43
percent over the period. The government’s target range is
between 1 percent and 3 percent.  One-year interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, were unchanged at 1.59
percent. The  Bank of Israel  last month kept  interest rates  at
1.75 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
