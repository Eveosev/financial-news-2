Soc. Quimica y Minera de Chile SA ,
the South American country’s largest fertilizer producer, fell
the most in three months after the company reported profit that
trailed estimates.  SQM, as the company is also known, sank 2.7 percent to
25,753 pesos at the close of trading in Santiago, the biggest
one-day decline since Nov. 21. The shares are down 6.4 percent
this year.  Fourth-quarter net income fell 11 percent from a year
earlier to $141.8 million, less than the $161 million average
estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Profit in the
last three months of 2012 was the lowest since the quarter ended
in June 2011.  The decline in profits came as a result of
“disappointing” volumes and weaker pricing, Banchile-Citi, the
joint research department of lender Banco de Chile and
Citigroup, said in a research note. “Uncertainties on
fertilizer demand and increased market supply in iodine and
lithium keep management cautious on 2013.”  SQM also had its rating cut to neutral from buy at Miller
Tabak & Co, with a price target of $60 per American depositary
receipt. The ADRs fell 2.6 percent to $54.31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
