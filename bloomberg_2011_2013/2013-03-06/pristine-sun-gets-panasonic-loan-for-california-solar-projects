Pristine Sun LLC , a closely held
solar energy developer, said it received a loan from  Panasonic
Corp. (6752)  to build 50 megawatts of projects in  California .  Half of the projects will be completed this year and half
next year, Pristine Sun Chief Executive Officer Troy Helming
said today by e-mail. The San Francisco-based company announced
the projects in a statement today.  The projects, located in rural areas mostly in northern
California, will average about 1-megawatt of capacity each and
may cost as much as $150 million, Helming said. Pristine may
seek an equity co-owner once they enter operation, he said.
Helming declined to provide loan details or name the solar panel
suppliers.  Pristine has 28 contracts to sell about half the output
from the projects to  PG&E Corp. (PCG) , which will pay about 13 cents a
kilowatt-hour on average, after factoring in time-of-day price
adjustments, Helming said. His company expects to win contracts
for the remainder of the projects under a state-approved
program, he said.  Aaron Fowles, a spokesman for Panasonic, said the company
is sharing engineering, procurement and construction duties with
Pristine Sun. He also declined to provide terms of the loan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
