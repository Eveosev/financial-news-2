Most Hungarian executives expect the
economy to contract this year amid concern that government
measures are “unpredictable,” according to an annual survey
published by PriceWaterhouseCoopers.  Fifty-one percent of the more than 170 business leaders
polled expect  Hungary ’s  economy  to shrink this year, with 39
percent predicting stagnation and 5 percent forecasting economic
growth, the survey showed.  “Hungarian executives are fundamentally unsatisfied with
government measures,” according to the survey, which was
conducted between October and December last year. “The high
level of dissatisfaction surrounding the government’s work
reflects that regular and meaningful dialog between the parties
is becoming unavoidable.”  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s self-styled “unorthodox”
measures, including extraordinary industry taxes, retroactive
taxation, the nationalization of private pension-fund assets and
government-ordered household energy price cuts, have sapped
investor confidence and helped push the economy into a recession
last year.  Orban pledged to revive growth this year while delivering
on a promise to keep the budget  deficit  below a European Union
limit of 3 percent of output.  Executives see government measures aimed at reducing the
country’s debt level and narrowing the  budget deficit  as “most
dangerous” for their business development, while concern about
a higher tax burden ranks second among risk factors, according
to the survey. Over two-thirds of the polled executives expect
their tax burden to increase in 2013 from a year earlier, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
