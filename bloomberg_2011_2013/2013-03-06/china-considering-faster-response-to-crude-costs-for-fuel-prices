China  is considering ways to respond
faster to changes in international crude costs when setting
domestic gasoline and diesel prices, the chairman of the
nation’s top economic planner said.  Under the current pricing mechanism, which measures the
change in the 22-day moving average cost of a basket of crude
grades, the adjustment period is too long and the 4 percent
threshold for revisions is too high, Zhang Ping, the chairman of
the National Development and Reform Commission, said at a press
conference in Beijing today.  China plans to use more market-based price systems to
improve energy efficiency and curb losses at state-owned oil
companies such as  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , or Sinopec,
and  PetroChina (857)  Co. The nation will reduce energy use per unit of
gross domestic product by at least 3.7 percent this year under
targets announced by the NDRC yesterday. PetroChina’s crude-
processing operations lost 30 billion  yuan  ($4.8 billion) in the
first nine months of 2012, the company said Oct. 30.  “The new pricing regime will ensure profitability for both
PetroChina and Sinopec’s refining divisions, while passing on
higher energy costs to consumers to encourage them not to waste
fuel,”  Gordon Kwan , the head of energy research at Mirae Asset
Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong, said by e-mail today. “Higher
fuel costs should slow China’s GDP growth from 7.8 percent last
year to the target of 7.5 percent this year.”  The NDRC tracks international crude costs via a basket of
Brent, Dubai and  Indonesia ’s Cinta grades. It increased fuel
prices last month for the first time since September, boosting
gasoline by 300 yuan a metric ton and diesel by 290 yuan a ton.  Modifications to the mechanism will be aimed at making
fuel-price adjustments more timely, and the government is
expected to set a minimum and maximum level for changes, Liao
Kaishun, an analyst with ICIS C1 Energy, said by phone from
Guangzhou.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
