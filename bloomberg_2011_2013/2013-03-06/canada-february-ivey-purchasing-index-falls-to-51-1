Canada’s Ivey purchasing managers’
 index  fell further in February than economists forecast, adding
to evidence the economy is struggling to accelerate early in
2013.  The index fell to 51.1 on a seasonally adjusted basis from
58.9 in January, according to a statement on the website of
Western University’s business school. Readings of more than 50
indicate purchasing by governments and companies advanced. The
reading was below the least optimistic of 10 economists  surveyed 
by Bloomberg News.  The data was published at the same time the Bank of Canada
announced it had kept the benchmark rate on overnight loans
between commercial banks at 1 percent while softening language
about tighter policy for the second meeting in a row. Policy
makers led by Governor Mark Carney said inflation will “remain
low in the near term” in an economy with “material excess
capacity.”  Among  related indexes , the employment figure increased to
55.8 from 53.8, while the inventories index plunged to 43.6 to
54.4. The supplier delivery measure dropped to 52.2 from 55.8,
and the price index rose to 58.8 from 54.  To contact the reporter on this story:
