A third of Serbian corn held by the
Commodity Reserves Agency has been contaminated by aflatoxins,
state-owned Tanjug news agency said, citing the agency’s chief.  Around 50,000 tons of corn or nearly a third of what’s kept
by the  Commodity Reserves Agency  have been affected and
“temporarily sealed off” and the corn will be treated
adequately, Tanjug quoted Goran Tasic as saying.  The government has set aside 20,000 tons of corn, or 300
kilograms per milking cow, to be distributed to small milk
producers whose farms have been closed after aflatoxins, which
are produced by fungi and considered carcinogenic to humans and
animals, spread to milk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
