4SC AG (VSC) ’s newly announced Chief
Executive Officer Enno Spillner said the company is in talks to
find a partner for its experimental cancer drug resminostat and
expects to start late-stage clinical trials by mid-2013.  Current CEO Ulrich Dauer will step down at the end of the
month for personal reasons, the Martinsried, Germany-based
company said today. Spillner will add the CEO role to his
existing position of chief financial officer.  4SC is planning to test the drug in combination with  Bayer
AG (BAYN) ’s Nexavar in a pivotal trial of liver cancer patients,
Spillner said in a phone interview today. The biotechnology
company needs an investor to finance the last round of trials to
produce the safety and efficacy data needed for regulatory
approval.  “We’ve started partnering talks, and we’d ideally like to
start the clinical study by mid-year,” Spillner said.  The trial could run until 2016, allowing the company to ask
regulators for approval by 2017.  Doctors will diagnose about 30,640 new cases of liver
cancer this year in the U.S., and 21,670 people will die of the
disease, according to the  American Cancer Society . Resminostat
is also being tested in patients with colorectal cancer and
Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.  Spillner also plans to establish at least one collaboration
to develop and market drugs in the coming 18 months, along the
lines of 4SC’s recent agreement with LEO Pharma A/S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
