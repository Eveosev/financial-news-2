The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region from non-payment
declined, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 3 basis points to 113
basis points as of 9:37 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The measure is on track for its lowest close since March
2011, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan decreased 1 basis point to 106 as of
8:35 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. prices show. The benchmark is set for its lowest close
since Jan. 14, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 3 basis points to
112 as of 11:37 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking
Corp. The gauge is on course for its lowest close since Feb. 22,
according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
