Bryan Bickell scored two goals 3 1/2
minutes apart to help the  Chicago Blackhawks  beat the  Minnesota 
Wild 5-3 and extend their National Hockey League season-opening
point streak to 23 games.  The Blackhawks (20-0-3), who have earned at least one point
in each of their games this season, lead the league with 43
points. The Wild (11-9-2) have 24 points.  Brandon Saad and Marian Hossa joined Bickell in first-
period scoring to give the Blackhawks a 4-1 lead last night on
their home ice at the United Center. Devin Setoguchi had given
the Wild a 1-0 lead.  Ryan Suter had a power-play goal early in the third period
and Kyle Brodziak added another score to pull Minnesota within
4-3 before  Patrick Kane  sealed the victory for the Blackhawks
with his 12th goal of the season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
