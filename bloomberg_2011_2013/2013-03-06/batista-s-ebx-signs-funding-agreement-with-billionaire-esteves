Eike Batista , the Brazilian
billionaire whose estimated net worth has plunged 71 percent in
a year, signed a financing arrangement with Grupo BTG Pactual.  The so-called strategic cooperation agreement with
Batista’s EBX Group Co. includes financial advisory, lines of
credit and future long-term capital investments in projects,
according to an e-mailed statement from EBX.  Batista and BTG’s billionaire chief executive,  Andre Esteves , will lead a strategic and financial management
committee, EBX said. The agreement doesn’t imply BTG will be the
only provider of financial services to EBX, it said. Fees will
depend on performance of EBX companies.  Batista, 56, is seeking to raise money, including through
the sale of assets, to boost output at existing projects. His
oil business,  OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA , cut
production targets in June, fueling additional declines at six
publicly traded firms he owns. His net worth has plunged to $9.9
billion from $34.5 billion on March 31, according to the
 Bloomberg Billionaires Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
