Canadian  stocks  rose for a second
day as the central bank said its interest-rate policy is likely
to be unchanged for some time amid slowing growth in the world’s
11th-largest economy.  Trilogy Energy Corp. (TET)  surged 9.3 percent as an analyst with
Salman Partners Inc. raised the energy company’s stock rating.
BlackBerry climbed 4.7 percent after its chief executive officer
said the latest line of smartphones was luring customers from
rivals. Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. rose 1 percent as the
company said it was ahead of schedule with a job-reduction plan.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 77.60
points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,813.64 at 12:30 p.m. in Toronto.
The S&P/TSX has risen 3.1 percent this year.  “The rising market today is a combination of the follow-
through from the strong markets of the past few days and the
fact that interest rates appear to be unchanged for a period of
time,” said Anish Chopra, managing director and fund manager
with TD Asset Management Ltd., from Toronto. His firm oversees
about C$204 billion ($198 billion).  The Bank of Canada kept the benchmark  rate  on overnight
loans between commercial banks at 1 percent. It said inflation
will “remain low in the near term” in an economy with
“material excess capacity.”  Slower Growth  Statistics Canada said March 1 that output expanded at a
0.6 percent annualized pace in the fourth quarter, slower than
Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney’s 1 percent forecast from
January. The 0.5 percent inflation rate seen in that month
remains well below his 2 percent target.  “The Canadian economy isn’t growing as fast as the U.S.,”
Chopra said. “So you’re seeing the implications of that in how
the Bank of Canada is positioning its rates, that it could stay
at 1 percent for quite a while.”  Global stocks rose to the highest in more than 4 1/2 years
today, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its record
as a private report showed faster-than-forecast U.S. jobs
growth.  Raw materials stocks  contributed  most to gains in the
S&P/TSX, rising 2.4 percent as a group. Eight of 10 index groups
advanced. Trading volume was 8.8 percent higher than the 30-day
average at this time of the day.  Gold Advances  Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest gold producer, rose
2.3 percent to C$29.99. Goldcorp Inc. climbed 3.6 percent to
C$34.07. Gold for April delivery rose 0.5 percent to $1,582.80
an ounce in New York, extending a two-day rally.  Trilogy Energy jumped C$2.43 to C$28.58, headed for its
biggest percentage gain since August 2011. Gordon Currie, senior
analyst with Salman Partners, changed his rating for the stock
to buy from hold and said the company could afford to raise its
dividend. “Trilogy has a relatively low dividend compared to
peer group companies,” he said in a client note. Trilogy’s
dividend yield is about 1.5 percent, compared with 3.2 percent
for the S&P/TSX Energy Index.  BlackBerry, formerly known as Research In Motion Ltd.,
increased 60 Canadian cents to C$13.50 after CEO Thorsten Heins,
in an interview with the Spanish newspaper Expansion, said he
was “a little surprised” that the BlackBerry Z10 smartphone
was attracting customers from other platforms.  “Operators are supporting us a lot because they want
BlackBerry 10 to be an alternative to Samsung and Apple,” Heins
said in an interview with the newspaper during the  Mobile World
Congress  in Barcelona last week.  Canadian Pacific rose C$1.35 to C$130.77, putting it on
track to close at an all-time high. Chief Executive Officer
 Hunter Harrison , speaking today at a transportation conference
in New York, said the company has already cut more than 3,000
jobs and is ahead of its schedule to eliminate more than one-
fifth of its workforce by 2016.  Torstar Corp. (TS/B) , publisher of the Toronto Star newspaper,
tumbled 9.2 percent to C$7.18 after reporting fourth-quarter
adjusted  earnings  of 49 Canadian cents a share, short of the
average estimate of 53 cents according to a Bloomberg survey of
eight analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
