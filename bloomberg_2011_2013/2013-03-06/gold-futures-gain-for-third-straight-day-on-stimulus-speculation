Gold rose for the third straight day
amid speculation that central banks will continue stimulus
measures to boost growth.  European Central Bank policy makers meet tomorrow after
President  Mario Draghi  signaled last month the bank has no
intention of tightening monetary policy anytime soon.The  Federal
Reserve  is scheduled to release its Beige Book report at 2 p.m.
in Washington.  Orders to U.S. factories fell in January by the
most in five months, the Commerce Department said today.  “The stimulus story is not over as yet,”  Bill O’Neill , a
partner at Logic Advisors in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey,
said in a telephone interview. “Also, physical demand has shown
some signs of improvement.”  Gold futures for April delivery climbed 0.2 percent to
$1,577.90 an ounce at 12:29 p.m. on the Comex in New York. The
metal retreated 6 percent this year through yesterday.  Earlier, prices fell as much as 0.5 percent, mainly as
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President  Charles Plosser 
said in a speech today the central bank should slow the pace of
its bond purchases.  Silver futures for May delivery increased 0.9 percent to
$28.87 an ounce on the Comex, the fourth straight gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
