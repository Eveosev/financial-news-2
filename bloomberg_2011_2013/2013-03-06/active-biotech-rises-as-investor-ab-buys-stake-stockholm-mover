Active Biotech AB (ACTI)  rose to its
highest level in over five months in Stockholm after  Investor AB (INVEA) 
acquired an 8 percent stake in the company, which focuses on
treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.  Shares in Lund, Sweden-based Active Biotech rose as much as
8.1 percent to 52.75 kronor, the highest intraday level since
Oct. 4. Active Biotech had gained 4.5 percent as of 10:21 a.m.
in the Swedish capital, giving the company a market value of
3.52 billion kronor ($552 million).  Investor AB (INVEB) , the holding company of Sweden’s Wallenberg
family, acquired 6 million new shares at a price of 45 kronor
each, Active Biotech said today in a statement. The proceeds,
about 270 million kronor after costs, will be used to strengthen
the capital base and develop projects, including laquinimod for
treatment of multiple sclerosis and TASQ, a prostate-cancer
drug.  “Active Biotech’s portfolio has now matured and,
accordingly, our focus over the next 18-month period will be on
finding suitable partners and partnering structures for each
project,” Chief Executive Officer Tomas Leanderson said in the
statement. “A strong financial position is a prerequisite in
order to succeed with this activity in an optimal way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
