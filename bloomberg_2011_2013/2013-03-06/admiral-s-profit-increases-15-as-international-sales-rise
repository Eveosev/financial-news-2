Admiral Group Plc (ADM) , the U.K. motor
insurer that owns the confused.com website, said full-year
profit rose 15 percent as international sales increased by a
third.  Pretax profit climbed to 345 million pounds ($522 million)
in 2012, compared with 299 million pounds a year earlier, the
Cardiff, Wales-based insurer said today in a statement. That
beat the 331.7 million-pound average  estimate  of 18 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The next 20 years will make the first 20 seem downright
pedestrian for Admiral Group,” Chief Executive Officer Henry Engelhardt said in the statement. “And if I do my job well,
then when the next wave of management takes over, it will
inherit a very strong foundation upon which to construct their
skyscraper.”  Admiral, which insures 3.6 million vehicles mainly in the
U.K., is slowing its growth in its home market as insurers stem
the increase in whiplash claims and fraud after premiums reached
an all-time high in 2012. Admiral, which has more than
quadrupled in value since its initial public offering in 2004,
has grown profitably by undercutting competitors in a period of
rising prices.  Admiral’s net income rose 17 percent to 258.4 million
pounds in 2012, the firm said in the statement. The insurer
increased its dividend to 90.6 pence a share, beating the
analysts’ estimate of 85.8 pence.  International sales rose 33 percent to 163 million pounds
and customer numbers rose 42 percent in that business.  To contact the reporters on this story:
