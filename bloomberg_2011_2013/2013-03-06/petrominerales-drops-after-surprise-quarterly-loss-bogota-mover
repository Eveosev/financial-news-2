Petrominerales Ltd. (PMG) , the Calgary-
based oil company that operates in Colombia and  Peru , dropped to
a record after reporting a surprise fourth-quarter loss.  Shares declined 6.9 percent to 13,240 pesos at 1:17 p.m. in
Bogota, the all-time low on a closing basis. The stock has
fallen 9.7 percent this year, the third-worst performance on
Colombia’s Colcap index, which has decreased 1.5 percent. The
stock sank 6.9 percent in Toronto trading.  Petrominerales reported an adjusted net loss of 63 cents a
share in the fourth quarter after profit of 72 cents in the same
period a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected
earnings per share of 32 cents.  “The business is broken,” Ian Macqueen, an analyst at
CIBC World Markets Inc. in Calgary, said by e-mail. Investors
“will likely focus on the current production and the lack of
reserves growth.”  Production fell 29 percent to an average 25,140 barrels a
day in the fourth quarter and has since declined to 22,461
barrels a day so far in the first quarter, the company said
today in a statement.  “We’re not going to pretend that we’re happy with the
results we’ve generated on an exploration basis,” Chief
Executive Officer Corey Ruttan said today on a conference call.
“We’re being a bit more balanced with our capital program
between developments, our core exploration and positioning plays
for the future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
