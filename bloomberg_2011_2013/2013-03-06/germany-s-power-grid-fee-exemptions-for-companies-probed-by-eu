Germany ’s power grid fee exemptions
for companies that use large amounts of energy are being probed
by European Union regulators over concerns that they may be
illegal government subsidies.  The European Commission said it would investigate the fee
waiver for large electricity customers, worth 300 million euros
($391 million) last year, following complaints from consumer
groups, energy companies and others, according to an e-mailed
statement today. The waiver is financed by a levy paid by other
consumers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
