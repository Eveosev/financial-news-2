National Express  Group Plc’s No. 1
investor, Elliott Advisors, hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch
to sell half its stake in the U.K. rail and bus operator.  Elliott will dispose of 50.6 million shares, or 9.9 percent
of the total, via a secondary placing, it said today in a
statement. The  New York  hedge fund owns about 20 percent of
National Express stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  National Express shares closed at 230 pence in London today,
valuing the business at 1.18 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) and
giving the stake Elliott is offloading a notional worth of 11.6
million pounds. The shares will be sold to institutional
shareholders and the actual price remains to be set.  The planned sale “reflects Elliott’s desire to diversify
its portfolio and invest in new opportunities,” the U.S. firm
said in the statement, while adding that National Express
remains one of its “most important investments.”  National Express came to a truce with Elliott almost two
years ago, agreeing to appoint three independent non-executive
directors to its board after the investor had demanded that
management consider a takeover or breakup to boost earnings.  No further disposals will be made for at least 90 days
after the initial placement of shares, Elliot said. National
Express stock has advanced almost 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
