(Corrects forecast for car sales to all brands in second
paragraph in story dated March 6.)  General Motors Co.’s (GM)  plans for
growth in  Africa  will be led by sales of its  Isuzu KB  range of
pick-up trucks, with production starting in South Africa and
Egypt later this year.  African sales of all vehicles are expected to rise 43
percent to 2 million units by 2016, compared with 1.4 million
last year, Mario Spangenberg, president of GM Africa, told
reporters in Johannesburg today. Detroit-based GM operates four
manufacturing plants across South Africa,  Kenya , and Egypt, with
production expected to increase to 100,000 units from 2013.  “We can anticipate that the continent as a whole will
become more and more important,” Spangenberg said. “The Isuzu
KB is a vehicle vitally important to GM in Africa.”  The world’s biggest automakers have been increasing
investment in emerging regions such as Brazil, India and  Russia 
as well as Africa in recent years to make up for slowing or
stagnant sales in developed European or U.S. markets.  GM, which also owns the Opel and Cadillac brands, started
production of the sixth generation of the Isuzu KB range at its
Port Elizabeth plant in South Africa this month, Spangenberg
said. Production in  Egypt  will begin in the second half this
year, he said.  South African vehicle sales rose 9.2 percent to 623,914
units in 2012, the slowest pace of growth in three years, the
National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa
said in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
