Sojaprotein AD (SJPT) , the biggest soy bean
processor in the Balkans, said profit fell 39 percent last year
as a weaker dinar boosted debt servicing costs and asset
writedowns increased.  Net income dropped to 689 million dinars ($8 million) from
1.14 billion dinars in 2011, while earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization surged more than 50 percent
to 2.1 billion dinars, the Novi Becej-based company said in a
regulatory filing today. Sales increased 23 percent to 14.95
billion dinars, while operating costs climbed 19 percent to
exceed 13 billion dinars on higher raw materials prices.  “It doesn’t look good but it’s largely because of the
financial expenses” that almost doubled to 1.46 billion dinars,
Nenad Gujanicic, chief broker at Sinteza Invest Group, said by
phone from Belgrade.  Writedowns soared to 680 million dinars from 34 million
dinars in 2011, according to the statement. Debt servicing costs
were 482 million dinars, compared with 135 million dinars a year
earlier.  Sojaprotein, majority-owned by Victoria Group AD, moved
toward higher value products last year when it opened a soy
protein concentrates plant with annual capacity of 70,000 tons.  Its  shares  gained 0.4 percent to 833 dinars in Belgrade
trading today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
