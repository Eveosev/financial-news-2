Bourbon SA (GBB) , owner of the biggest
fleet of supply and crew ships for the oil industry, jumped the
most in 17 months after unveiling a plan to sell and lease back
vessels to lower debt.  The shares rose  as much as  9.9 percent and were trading up
1.665 euros to 22.485 euros at 1:05 p.m. in Paris. The stock has
risen 8.3 percent since the start of the year.  Bourbon will sell as many as 85 vessels to unspecified
financial investors through 2014 for about $2.5 billion and then
rent them under 10-year contracts, the company said in a
presentation. The move will result in a “sharp reduction” in
net debt and financial costs by the end of 2015 while lowering
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  Without the vessel sales, debt would have risen to levels
“we would rather not have” and free cash flow generation would
be restricted, Chairman Jacques de Chateauvieux said on a
conference call. Bourbon will have the right of first refusal to
buy back the vessels without being obliged to do so.  Under a $2 billion expansion plan, Bourbon had planned to
operate 600 owned and chartered ships by 2015, up from 458 at
the end of last year. The board decided to commit the final 500
million euros of the expansion plan for 41 vessels to be
delivered in the coming months and 81 by the end of 2015, the
Paris-based company said today. The vessels to be sold will
represent almost a third of the fleet not counting crew boats.  Diversified Financing  Bourbon’s strategy and outlook for operations is
“reassuring,” Christine Ropert, an analyst at Gilbert Dupont
in Paris, said in a research note today. She kept a buy  rating 
on the shares.  Net debt rose to 2.06 billion euros at the end of 2012 from
1.96 billion euros the previous year. The shipowner has sought
diversification of financing away from French banks and could
borrow from the financial market by 2015, Chief Financial
Officer Laurent Renard said today.  Net income was 41.9 million euros in 2012 compared with 6.8
million euros a year earlier, the company said in a statement.
Sales rose 18 percent to 1.19 billion euros.  Bourbon kept a target to boost sales by 17 percent a year.  “The stability of the price per barrel at around $110 has
encouraged our clients to make substantial investments in the
market where growth prospects point to sustained demand for
vessels in 2013,” it said in the statement. Bourbon customers
include Total SA, Exxon Mobil Corp. and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)   Rates at which Bourbon rents vessels to oil companies had
“good increases” last year, Chief Executive Officer Christian Lefevre said on the call. The rates rose in the second half for
all vessel types compared with the two preceding six-month
periods.  “Africa is a big growth zone,” he said. The company has
expanded operations from  Angola  to Ivory Coast,  Ghana  and East
Africa.  By contrast,  Brazil , where offshore discoveries hold
promise for international oil companies, has proved
“difficult,” Lefevre said. Project delays mean vessel demand
is “stagnating.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
