Qatar Airways Ltd. Chief Executive
Officer Akbar  Al Baker  said he was told by Airbus SAS that the
smallest variant of its new A350 plane wouldn’t see the light of
day and dropped his order, a claim the manufacturer disputes.  The A350-800 remains a “key member of the A350 family,”
Airbus spokesman  Stefan Schaffrath  said in a statement in
response to Al Baker’s comments to journalists at the ITB
tourism fair in Berlin today.  Qatar, the first customer that will fly the A350 wide-body
plane, pulled out of its order for 20 A350-800s in December and
switched into a bigger model. Airbus said at the time that
dropping the smallest of its three A350 variants would leave it
with an unprotected flank against  Boeing Co (BA) ’s 787 Dreamliner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
