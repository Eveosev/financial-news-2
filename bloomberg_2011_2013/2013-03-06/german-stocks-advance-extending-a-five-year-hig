German stocks  advanced, extending
their highest level in more than five years, as Henkel AG and
 Lanxess AG (LXS)  climbed.  Henkel rose for a second day as the maker of Loctite glue
and Persil detergent predicted that sales will grow and
profitability will increase.  Axel Springer AG (SPR)  fell the most in
almost five months as  Europe ’s largest newspaper publisher
forecast lower profit for this year.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  rallied 1.2 percent to 7,963.38 at 10:31 a.m.
in  Frankfurt . The equity benchmark has  gained 4.6 percent  this
year as U.S. lawmakers agreed on a budget avoiding automatic
fiscal changes that had threatened to push the world’s biggest
economy into a recession. The broader HDAX Index rose 1.1
percent today.  “The current situation on the trading floor is affected by
a strong momentum due to the immense liquidity, which must be
invested,” Roger Peeters, chief executive officer at Close
Brothers Seydler Research in Frankfurt, wrote in e-mailed
comments. “The technical situation is leading to further
interest by investors with a low exposure or short sellers, who
will be squeezed.”  U.S. stocks rallied yesterday, pushing the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average (INDU)  126 points higher to close at an all time
high of 14,253.77.  Henkel Gains  Henkel added 2 percent to 70.06 euros after predicting that
sales will grow as much as 5 percent in 2013. The company’s
earnings before interest and taxes as a percentage of sales will
rise to as much as 14.5 percent this year, more than the 14.1
percent margin that Henkel reported today for 2012.  Lanxess increased 4.6 percent to 68.10 euros, posting the
biggest gain on a gauge of  European chemical makers .  Axel Springer slid 4.2 percent to 34.76 euros as the
publisher of Bild and Die Welt forecast profit will fall this
year because of spending to accelerate its shift to digital
publications. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization will probably drop by less than 10 percent, Berlin-
based Axel Springer said. Analysts had projected Ebitda would
rise 4.1 percent to 654 million euros ($854 million) from 628
million euros in 2012,  data compiled  by Bloomberg show.  Kloeckner & Co., the German steel trader part-owned by the
 Knauf family , slipped 2.1 percent to 11.66 euros as it posted a
net loss of 198 million euros in 2012, compared with a profit of
10 million euros in 2011. Ebitda including restructuring costs
dropped to 62 million euros from 217 million euros in 2011, the
Duisburg-based company said in a statement.  IVG Immobilien AG (IVG)  sank 19 percent to 1.87 euros, its
largest drop in more than four years, as the real estate
developer reported a net loss of 98.7 million euros. The shares
were downgraded to sell from buy at Baader Bank AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
