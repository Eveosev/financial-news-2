Germany ’s BdB banking group, which
represents lenders such as Deutsche Bank AG and Commerzbank AG,
predicts “moderate growth” in  Europe ’s largest economy in 2013
after a slump at the end of last year.  “After a short pause, the German economy is back on its
growth path,” Hans-Joachim Massenberg, a member of the
management board of Berlin-based BdB, said today in an e-mailed
statement. He forecasts an expansion of 0.7 percent this year.  Signs are mounting that Germany’s economy has begun to
recover from its fourth-quarter contraction. Confidence among
businesses and investors is improving, factory orders and
industrial production are forecast to have risen for a second
month in January and unemployment unexpectedly declined for a
third month in February.  At the same time, at least six of the region’s 17 economies
remain mired in recession. The  European Central Bank , which in
December predicted the region to shrink 0.3 percent in 2013,
will present new economic forecasts tomorrow.  “Despite first signs of hope,” the situation in the euro
area remains “subdued,” Massenberg said, adding that companies
won’t start to invest until confidence in the future of the
currency union improves. “After the Italian election, new
uncertainties have been flaring up,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
