The European Commission opened an
in-depth probe into whether aid given to five football clubs by
some local authorities in the Netherlands violates EU rules on
state support.  “I strongly believe that professional football clubs
should be well managed and not ask for help from the taxpayer
when facing financial difficulties,”  Joaquin Almunia , the EU’s
antitrust chief, said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
