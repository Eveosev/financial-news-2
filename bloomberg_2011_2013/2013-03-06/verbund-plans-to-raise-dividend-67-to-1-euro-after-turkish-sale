Verbund AG (VER) , the biggest utility in
 Austria , fell the most in five weeks in Vienna trading after
forecasting lower operating profit for 2013, citing weaker power
prices and stagnating demand in  Europe .  The shares  fell  as much as 3.8 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since Jan. 29, and declined 2.3 percent to 16
euros at 4:25 p.m. local time. More than 685,000 shares changed
hands, triple the average volume over the past three months.  The power market has become “insecure and very
challenging,” Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Anzengruber told
journalists in Vienna today. The company will probably make
around 50 euros ($65) a megawatt-hour this year, compared with
52 euros in 2012, he said.  Verbund, which generates most of its 35,000 gigawatt-hour
output from hydro plants in the Alps and along Austrian rivers,
said it will focus on domestic and southern German hydropower
and will restructure or sell assets it doesn’t deem to have
strategic value. It agreed to swap its 50 percent stake in
 Turkey ’s Enerjisa Enerji AS for EON SE’s stake in eight German
hydropower plants in December.  If the deal is completed successfully, which Anzengruber
sees happening “in the coming weeks,” the  dividend  will be
raised from 60 cents to 1 euro per share, he said.  While the special dividend is a one-off, the earnings
decline is here to stay, analysts at Deutsche Bank AG wrote in a
note to clients. The bank  suggests  selling the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
