Syrian refugees fleeing the civil
war for Lebanon, Jordan,  Turkey  and other countries reached 1
million, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees  Antonio Guterres .  “With a million people in flight, millions more displaced
internally, and thousands of people continuing to cross the
border every day,  Syria  is spiraling toward full-scale
disaster,” Guterres said today in a  statement  issued by the
UN’s refugee agency. “This tragedy has to be stopped.”  UNHCR is adjusting a December plan to deal with a projected
1.1 million refugees by June, after more than 400,000 people
fled Syria since the beginning of this year. That plan is only
25 percent funded, the UN agency said.  Syria’s civil war has evolved along largely sectarian
lines, with many in the Sunni majority supporting the rebels and
much of the Shiite Muslim, Christian and Alawite minorities
backing President Bashar al-Assad. The two-year-old conflict has
killed about 70,000 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
