The euro strengthened the most in
eight weeks against the dollar after European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  said data suggest the region’s economy
will stabilize this year.  The yen fell to lowest level since August 2009 versus the
dollar after  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s Masaaki Shirakawa’s final meeting
amid speculation his successor will expand monetary stimulus and
debase the currency. The 17-nation currency advanced for a
second day versus the yen as ECB policy makers refrained from
cutting their benchmark  interest rate  at a meeting today and
Spanish borrowing costs declined at a bond auction. The dollar
declined versus most major peers before a report tomorrow
forecast to show increased jobs gains in February.  “The rally in Spanish bond yields showed the market is
feeling a little bit more confident with the situation in
 Europe ,” Steven Englander, head of Group of 10 currency
strategy at Citigroup in  New York , said in a telephone
interview. “The Draghi press conference dealt with questions
well, which kind of enhanced the euro’s move up.”  The euro rose 1.1 percent to $1.3107 at 5 p.m. in New York
after gaining as much as 1.2 percent, the most since Jan. 10,
when the ECB also held a policy meeting. The single currency
advanced 1.9 percent to 124.28 yen.  Yen Slumps  Japan ’s currency weakened 0.8 percent to 94.82 per dollar,
falling below 95 and touching the lowest level since Aug. 18,
2009.  “Both fiscal and monetary policy are working together to
revive the Japanese economy, and that’s currency negative,”
 Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at Bank of  Nova
Scotia , said by phone from Toronto.  Sweden’s krona climbed to the strongest since August
against the euro after Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves signaled
policy makers will tolerate further gains, telling Swedish
lawmakers that the currency’s level was “not in any way
remarkable.” The krona gained 0.4 percent to 8.2942 per euro
after appreciating to 8.2845, the strongest level since Aug. 28.  The South Korean won snapped a two-day rally against the
dollar as global investors sold shares in the country and after
Credit Suisse Group AG recommended betting against the currency.
The won declined 0.4 percent to 1,082.60 per dollar after
falling as much as 0.5 percent.  Rand Reacts  South Africa ’s rand reached its weakest level in almost
four years as labor protests at mines spurred concern of a
repeat of violence that curbed production last year. It
decreased 0.2 percent to 9.1441 per dollar after reaching
9.1884, its lowest level since April 2009.  “In the near-term, the euro should stay above $1.30 and
will possibly pop to $1.32 or $1.33,” said  Derek Halpenny ,
European head of global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd in  London .  The ECB kept its  benchmark rate  at a record low of 0.75
percent as forecast by 56 of 61 economists  surveyed  by  Bloomberg
News . Five predicted a reduction to 0.5 percent.  “Later in 2013 economic activity should gradually recover,
supported by a strengthening global backdrop and our
accommodative monetary policy stance,” Draghi said at a press
conference in  Frankfurt  after the decision was announced. The
euro’s exchange rate is in line with long-term averages and is
not a policy target, he said.  Spain’s Debt  The single currency strengthened in earlier trading after
 Spain  sold 5.03 billion euros of bonds, surpassing its target of
5 billion euros. The Madrid-based Treasury auctioned 10-year
securities at an average yield of 4.917 percent, down from 5.20
percent at the previous sale on Feb. 21.  The euro has appreciated 1.8 percent this year according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar gained 2.5 percent and
the yen slumped 7.1 percent.  The pound reversed earlier losses versus the dollar after
the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee held its asset-
purchase  target  at 375 billion pounds ($565 billion), as
forecast by 29 of 39 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Ten
predicted an expansion.  “Clearly not all members of the MPC are on the same page
yet and some hawkishness remains,” said  Neil Jones , head of
European hedge fund sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in
London, before the decision. “The pound will advance
initially.”  The pound was little changed at $1.5014 after dropping to
$1.4967, the weakest level since July 2010. Sterling declined
1.1 percent to 87.30 pence per euro.  Japan Policy  The yen dropped for a second day versus the dollar even as
the BOJ rejected a call for an immediate start to open-ended
asset purchases. Shirakawa left policy unchanged at his final
meeting yesterday before his March 19 exit.  Investors are focused on changes his nominated successor,
Haruhiko Kuroda, may enact, with the Nikkei 225 Stock Average
rising 35 percent since mid-November in anticipation of more
aggressive stimulus.  The Japanese currency also fell after a Labor Department
report showed the number of Americans who filed for  unemployment
benefits  declined to a six-week low, damping demand for the
relative safety of the yen.  First-time U.S. jobless claims fell by 7,000 to 340,000 in
the week ended March 2, the lowest since the period ended Jan.
19, the Labor Department said. The  median forecast  of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for an increase to 355,000.  U.S. employers added 165,000 jobs last month, compared with
157,000 in January, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
economists. The  unemployment rate  held at 7.9 percent, another
survey projected.  “U.S. data surprised positively and therefore the dollar
bounced higher against the yen in line with an increase in risk
appetite,” said Peter Kinsella, a currency strategist at
Commerzbank AG in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
