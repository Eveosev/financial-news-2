Shawne Merriman, a three-time Pro
Bowl pass rusher who missed 30 games the past three seasons
because of injuries, said he’s retiring from the National
Football League following a seven-year career in which he
totaled 45 1/2 sacks.  Merriman, 28, said on his  website  that he’s leaving the NFL
because he wants to “retire on his own terms and leave while I
know I can still physically play the game.” Merriman missed 24
games because of Achilles tendon injuries during the 2010-11 NFL
seasons and played 10 games for the Buffalo Bills last year,
making one start and collecting one sack.  Merriman, a former first-round draft pick, was the NFL’s
defensive rookie of the year in 2005 for the San Diego Chargers.
He registered 39 1/2 sacks during his first three seasons,
including 17 in 12 games in 2006, and became known for his
“Lights Out” dance after bringing down opposing quarterbacks.
Merriman was also suspended for four games during the 2006
season for failing a steroids test. At the time, his agent said
Merriman unknowingly ingested the banned anabolic steroid
Nandralone in a supplement.  Merriman had six sacks over his final four NFL seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
