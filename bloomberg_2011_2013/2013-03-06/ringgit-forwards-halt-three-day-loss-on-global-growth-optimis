Malaysia’s ringgit forwards snapped a
three-day decline as improved service-industry growth in the
world’s largest economy spurred a surge in global shares and
encouraged risk-taking.  Government bonds  were steady.  The MSCI Asia Pacific  Index (MXAP)  of stocks advanced to an August
2011 high today after the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  reached a
record yesterday. A non-manufacturing index in the U.S. released
yesterday beat estimates to rise to the highest in a year, while
 China  vowed to maintain its 7.5 percent growth target for 2013.
Malaysia will keep  borrowing costs  at 3 percent tomorrow,
according to all 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards increased 0.1 percent
to 3.1648 per dollar as of 4:25 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts to buy or sell the
ringgit in a year were at a 1.9 percent discount to the spot
rate, which slipped 0.1 percent to 3.1053. Non-deliverable
forwards are settled in dollars.  “The improvement in global data is giving some support to
Asian currencies,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a rates strategist in
 Hong Kong  at Societe Generale SA. “We expect the ringgit to
strengthen to 3 per dollar by the end of the year.”  One-month implied volatility in the ringgit, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, declined for a
seventh day, the longest losing streak since April 2012. It fell
17 basis points, or 0.17 percentage point, to 6.67 percent.  The Malaysian currency, which has dropped 1.6 percent
against the dollar this year, “could quickly reverse” if the
current government stays in power after general elections to be
held before the end of June, Arup Ghosh, a Singapore-based hedge
funds strategist at Citicorp Investment Bank, said in an
interview.  The yield on the 3.418 percent notes due August 2022 was
little changed at 3.46 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
