Iceland’s opposition party “The
Movement” will seek a no confidence vote in the ruling minority
government for its failure to bring about constitutional reform,
party lawmaker Thor Saari told parliament today.  Saari said he wants the parliament to discuss the motion
tomorrow, according to a transcript of his comments on the
Reykjavik-based assembly’s website. Should the motion be
successful Saari wants a caretaker government composed of
members of all of Iceland’s political parties to take over until
parliamentary elections on April 27.  This is the second time this year that Saari has asked for
a no confidence vote. He withdrew a first one submitted on Feb.
20 because of a technical flaw, according to a Feb. 21
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
