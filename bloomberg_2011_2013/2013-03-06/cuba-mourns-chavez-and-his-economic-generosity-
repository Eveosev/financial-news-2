The  Cuban government  declared two
days of official mourning for Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez ,
who died yesterday at the age of 58 following a long battle with
cancer.  Cuba’s government praised Chavez’s goal of uniting the
people of  Latin America  and pledged loyalty to the continuation
of his Bolivarian Revolution, according to the statement in the
state-run Granma website.  “He deeply understood our challenges and problems and he
did what he could, with extraordinary generosity,” the
government said.  Venezuela sells cheap oil to the island nation, while Cuba
sends doctors and other professionals to work in Venezuela.
Chavez underwent four operations for an undisclosed form of
cancer in Cuba before his death.  To contact the reporter on this story:
