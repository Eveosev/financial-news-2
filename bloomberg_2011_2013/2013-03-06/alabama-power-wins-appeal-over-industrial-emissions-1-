Alabama Power Co. (SO)  won a challenge
over industrial emissions standards after a federal appeals
court ruled against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  The EPA approved changes in the state’s industrial
emissions standards in 2008 but reversed that decision in 2011,
saying there was “sufficient likelihood” the new rules would
increase air pollution. The new rules would change regulation of
smoke emissions at industrial plants and how often plants can
emit opaque smoke.  The three-member U.S. appeals court in Atlanta today struck
down the EPA’s reversal.  “We conclude the 2011 disapproval was unauthorized by the
 Clean Air Act ,” the appeals court ruled.  The EPA failed to “provide a clear statement of the error
committed in the 2008 approval,” according to the court.  Dawn Harris-Young, a spokeswoman for the EPA, declined to
comment on the ruling.  “The  Alabama  Department of Environmental Management’s 2008
rule is one of the strictest in the nation,” Brandon Glover, a
spokesman at Alabama Power, said in a statement. “While we are
still reviewing the full ruling, we are generally pleased with
the court’s decisions.”  Michael J. Churchman, executive director of the nonprofit
Alabama Environmental Council, which supported the 2011
reversal, said “the decision strongly favors the profits of
dirty, dangerous coal plants while creating a serious threat to
the health of communities across Alabama, which ought to be
everyone’s biggest concern.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
