MMI Holdings Ltd. (MMI) ,  South Africa ’s
third-largest insurer, said fiscal first-half profit rose 82
percent as the firm cut costs and a rally in the stock market
boosted the value of investments.  Net income for the six months ended Dec. 31 climbed to 1.47
billion rand ($163 million) from 805 million rand a year
earlier, the Cape Town-based insurer said in a statement today.
Diluted earnings per share increased 77 percent to 94 cents,
while the dividend rose 16 percent to 51 cents a share.  MMI has been cutting costs to shore up earnings after the
merger of  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) ’s Momentum Group Ltd. and Metropolitan
Holdings Ltd. that created the company in 2010. The insurer,
which operates in 12 countries outside of South  Africa , invests
some of the money it receives from insurance policies in the
stock market and in the six months through December South
Africa’s  FTSE/JSE All Share Index (JALSH)  rose 17 percent.  “Equity markets rose strongly during the reporting period
while long bond interest rates closed slightly lower,” MMI said
in the statement. “Targeted merger savings of 500 million rand
are on track, with a reduction of 256 million rand recorded to
date. Overall, the benefits envisaged as part of the merger
rationale are being realized.”  MMI climbed as much as 3.2 percent to 23.47 rand in
Johannesburg, the biggest intraday gain in almost two months.
The share rose 0.9 percent to 22.96 rand at 9:33 a.m., extending
an advance this year to 3.6 percent and giving the company a
market value of 36.1 billion rand.  Africa Investment  The insurer increased the value of new business an annual
18 percent to 340 million rand. The capital buffer, or cash set
aside against insolvency, was 3.8 billion rand at the end of
December, MMI said in the statement.  MMI also set aside 500 million rand for investment in
Africa.  “The money is available either as additional investments
or for the acquisition of businesses ideally in those 12
countries where we operate,” Nicolaas Kruger, chief executive
officer of MMI, said in a telephone interview today. “Southern
Africa is one growth area but more likely we will target a
combination of  East Africa  including Kenya and Tanzania, and
then West Africa with Ghana and  Nigeria .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
