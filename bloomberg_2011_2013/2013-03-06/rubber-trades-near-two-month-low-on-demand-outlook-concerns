Rubber futures gained for a second
day as oil and equity markets rallied on improving U.S.  service
industries  data.  The contract for delivery in August advanced as much as 1.7
percent to 292.5 yen a kilogram ($3,134 a metric ton) and closed
at 289.1 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. That pared this
year’s decline for a most active contract to 4.4 percent.  Asian stocks climbed to their highest level in two years
and crude futures rose for a second day in New York. U.S.
service industries expanded in February at the fastest pace in a
year and above analysts’ forecast, spreading optimism in the
world’s largest economy among investors from U.S. to Asia.  “Economic data are driving commodity prices higher,”
Chung Yang Ker, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte., said today
by phone from  Singapore .  The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing
index unexpectedly increased to 56 last month from 55.2 in
January, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said yesterday. Readings
above 50 signal expansion in the industries comprising 90
percent of the economy. The median Bloomberg forecast called for
the measure to ease to 55.  China , the biggest rubber user, maintained its economic
growth target at 7.5 percent for 2013, unchanged from 2012.
Outgoing Premier Wen Jiabao pledged to support economic
expansion yesterday at the annual meeting of the National
People’s Congress.  The contract for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 0.3 percent to 24,190  yuan  ($3,891) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board rose 0.6 percent to 89.25 baht ($3) a
kilogram, according to the Rubber Research Institute of
 Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
