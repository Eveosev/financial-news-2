Elliott Management Corp. said it’s
not trying to liquidate  Hess Corp. (HES)  and the New York-based oil
company is using “scare tactics” to convince shareholders to
support its proposed slate of directors.  John Hess, the company’s chairman and chief executive
officer, wrote in a letter to Relational Investors LLC yesterday
that Elliott Management was trying to liquidate Hess, a
statement the  New York  hedge fund disputed in an e-mail today.  Hess has proposed a slate of six new board members and said
it would exit its gasoline station and energy-trading businesses
as it becomes an oil exploration and production company.  Paul
Singer ’s Elliott Management, which owns a 4 percent state in
Hess, has proposed its own slate of directors and called the
company’s plans “incomplete.”  “Elliott has never suggested liquidating the company and
it is disappointing John Hess has resorted to scare tactics,”
the fund said in a statement today.  Jon Pepper , a Hess
spokesman, confirmed the Relational letter in an e-mail.  Relational Investors, which holds 2.7 percent of Hess, said
it wants the company to avoid a proxy fight with Elliott. Hess
should join its nominees with the Elliott slate to form a new
board, David Batchelder, principal of Relational, said in a
telephone interview today.  “We’ve been urging John and the board at Hess, for some
time now to reach out to Elliott and begin to negotiate a
resolution,” Batchelder said. “We urged the board not to get
defensive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
