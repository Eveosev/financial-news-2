Greek government spokesman Simos Kedikoglou said there was no truth to reports that Prime
Minister Antonis Samaras was planning to change the ministers in
his government.  “There is no issue at all of a reshuffle, period,”
Kedikoglou said in an e-mailed statement today.  Samaras assembled his ministers in June when three
political parties came together to form a government after two
elections in six weeks. His government is charged with carrying
out the reforms needed for  Greece  to continue receiving bailout
loans from the euro area and the  International Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
