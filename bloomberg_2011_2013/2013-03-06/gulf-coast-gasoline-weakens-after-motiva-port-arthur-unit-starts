U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline weakened to
the lowest level since mid-December after Motiva Enterprises LLC
confirmed that the largest crude unit at its Port Arthur, Texas,
refinery is running at planned rates.  The crude unit, which has a capacity of 325,000 barrels a
day, restored the production after several weeks of ramping up,
Kayla Macke, a Motiva spokeswoman in Houston, said by e-mail.
Total refinery capacity is 600,000 barrels a day.  Motiva started shutting other units, including a delayed
coker, a sulfur recovery unit and the smallest of three crude
units, known as VPS-2, for 38 days of maintenance, two people
familiar with operations said on Feb. 14.  Reformulated gasoline, or RBOB in the U.S. Gulf Coast
weakened 4.5 cents to a 25-cent discount against futures traded
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:07 p.m. East Coast
time, the widest differential since Dec. 17, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Conventional,  87-octane gasoline  weakened
1.12 cents to a discount of 28 cents.  The 3-2-1  crack spread  in the Gulf, a measure of refining
profitability based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , fell $1.04 to $31.54 a barrel. The same spread for
Light Louisiana Sweet oil dropped $1.24 to $9.49 a barrel.  New York Harbor gasoline weakened versus futures after
supplies of motor fuel on the U.S. East Coast grew 651,000
barrels to 60.5 million barrels in the week ended Mar. 1, the
highest level in almost a year, an Energy Information
Administration report showed today.  Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline, or RBOB, in  New York 
Harbor retreated 0.38 cents to 23.88 cents a gallon below
futures.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York Harbor, a measure of
refining profitability for gasoline and diesel fuel based on
Brent oil in  Europe , fell 40 cents to $12.97 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
