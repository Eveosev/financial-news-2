Swedish industry will curb
investments this year as the export-reliant  economy  struggles
with flagging foreign demand, a survey indicated.  Industry in the $500 billion  economy  plans to reduce
spending to 56.2 billion kronor ($8.8 billion) after raising it
to 56.9 billion kronor last year from 51.6 billion kronor in
2011, according to a survey of about 8,000 companies published
today by  Statistics Sweden .  “Investment plans for this year indicate a decreased
investment volume” in the  mining industry  which last year
recorded the largest increase of 69 percent, the statistics
office said in a statement on its website. The basic metals and
wood-products industries will continue to cut spending this year
after reducing investments by 30 percent and 18 percent
respectively last year, it said.  Swedish economic growth will pick up to 1.1 percent this
year, the government forecasts, after slowing to 0.8 percent
last year from 3.7 percent expansion in 2011, because of falling
demand for  exports , which account for about half of output.
About 70 percent of sales abroad go to  Europe , where countries
are cutting spending to reduce debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
