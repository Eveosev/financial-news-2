The U.S. Justice Department has
evidence to show that  McGraw-Hill Cos. (MHP)  unit Standard & Poor’s
knowingly inflated its ratings of mortgage bonds before the 2008
financial crisis, said Attorney General Eric Holder.  The department “believes our evidence will show” the
ratings company falsely represented that its ratings were
objective and weren’t influenced by investment banks, Holder
said today at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in
Washington.  The Justice Department and state attorneys general on Feb.
4 sued S&P and its parent company for least $5 billion in
damages on behalf of federally insured financial institutions.
The company has called the claims meritless and said it will
“vigorously” defend itself against the allegations.  Holder declined to discuss specifics of the case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
