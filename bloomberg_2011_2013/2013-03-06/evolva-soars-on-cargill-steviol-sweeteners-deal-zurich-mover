Evolva Holding SA (EVE) , a Swiss developer
of ingredients for food and health-care products, rose to the
highest in more than a month after agreeing to produce and
market sweeteners with Cargill Inc.  Evolva climbed 15 percent to 1.01 Swiss francs in Zurich,
the highest price since Feb. 7. The shares have more than
doubled this year, giving the company a market value of 175
million francs ($185 million), after losing a third of their
value in 2012.  Cargill will buy a 5 million Swiss franc stake in Evolva,
which will be eligible for as much as $7.5 million in milestone
payments, the Reinach-based company said in a statement today.
Evolva has the right to 45 percent of the final business, or
royalties from sales of the products developed.  Evolva will develop fermentation-derived steviol
glycosides, which will enable the production of better-tasting
and cheaper food products, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
