Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , the
bank that gets more than half its revenue from credit cards,
gave Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank a portion of his
compensation in cash for the first time since at least 1997.  The lender awarded Fairbank $2.19 million as a deferred
cash bonus, part of his $17.5 million compensation package for
2012, the McLean, Virginia-based company said yesterday in a
filing. It was the first time in at least 15 years that he
received cash as part of his salary or bonus,  Julie Rakes , a
Capital One spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  “The committee and the independent directors recognized
that including a deferred cash bonus for Mr. Fairbank would
bring his overall compensation program more in line with peer
practice for chief executive officers,” the lender said in the
filing.  The bonus must be deferred for three years and held in a
company plan that’s non-qualified and voluntary, according to
the filing. It will pay out in February 2016 and is subject to
clawback provisions.  Fairbank, 62, spent more than $28 billion on acquisitions
since 2005, including the purchase last year of HSBC Holdings
Plc’s U.S. card business. The acquisitions helped Capital One
become the eighth-largest U.S. lender by assets.  The CEO’s 2012 compensation also included $10.9 million in
stock and $4.38 million in options, the company said. Under
guidelines from securities regulators, which calculate pay
differently, Fairbank earned $22.6 million.  Capital One shares have dropped 6.9 percent this year
through yesterday, the  worst performance  in the 24-company  KBW
Bank Index (BKX) , which has advanced 7.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
