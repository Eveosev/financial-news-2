Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , India’s
biggest carmaker by sales volume, may begin building a new
factory as early as next quarter, to add capacity and access
ports on the nation’s west coast.  The New Delhi-based company will take a final decision on
when to begin construction at its next board meeting in April,
Chairman R.C. Bhargava said in a telephone interview today,
without giving a specific date.  The automaker signed an agreement in June to set up a
manufacturing facility in the western state of Gujarat.
Production will begin in the 12 months starting April 1, 2015,
boosting the company’s total capacity in India to 2 million cars
by that fiscal year, Maruti said June 2.  Maruti (MSIN)  currently has two factories in the country, near  New
Delhi . The automaker has the capability to build 1.45 million
units annually, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
