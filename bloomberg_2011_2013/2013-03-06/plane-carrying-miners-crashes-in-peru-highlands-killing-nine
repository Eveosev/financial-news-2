A plane carrying workers headed to a
gold mine in Peru’s northern Andes crashed, killing all nine
people on board, a police official said.  The plane chartered by Minera Aurifera Retamas SA crashed
five minutes before it was scheduled to touch down in Pataz,
where the company operates a gold mine, Roger Torres, the police
chief for the La Libertad region, told Lima-based news channel
Canal N.  The plane, which belonged to Lima-based Aero Transportes SA
and was carrying two Minera employees, five contractors and two
pilots, collided with an overhead power line before crashing,
according to Lima-based newspaper El Comercio.  “We’re committed to our people and we’re very hurt by what
happened,” Roberto Lazo, a spokesman for the mine, told Canal
N.  To contact the reporter on this story:
