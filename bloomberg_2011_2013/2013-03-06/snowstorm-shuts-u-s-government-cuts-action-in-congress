A snowstorm barreling in from the
U.S. Midwest closed federal government offices in  Washington 
today and shortened schedules in Congress.  The National Weather Service forecast as much as eight
inches of snow for the Washington metropolitan area, with
heavier snowfall of a foot or more west of the city. Light snow
was falling in the early morning hours, and it was expected to
become steadier throughout the day.  The Office of Personnel Management said federal departments
and agencies are closed for non-emergency workers.  At the White House, President  Barack Obama  had a light
public schedule that included a routine daily intelligence
briefing, lunch with Vice President Joe Biden and a meeting with
the new Treasury secretary,  Jacob Lew . Because of the weather,
spokesman  Jay Carney  canceled his daily press briefing.  The U.S. House planned to meet at 10 a.m., earlier than
originally planned. Lawmakers are scheduled to vote at about 1
p.m. on a catch-all spending bill to fund the government through
Sept. 30. A number of Senate and House hearings were postponed.  As of 8 a.m. Washington time, the late-winter storm had
caused about two inches of snowfall in southwestern suburbs of
Washington. City streets were mostly wet with little
accumulation; the storm was to gather intensity by mid-morning.  Most schools were closed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
