West Texas Intermediate oil fell for
the fourth time in five days after a government report showed
U.S. inventories increased more than forecast last week.  Prices dropped 0.4 percent after the Energy Information
Administration said supplies rose 3.83 million barrels, more
than four times the 788,000-barrel median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of analysts. Refineries operated at the lowest
rate in almost a year, reducing demand for crude to process into
fuels. Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  died yesterday, and an
election must be held within 30 days in OPEC’s fourth-biggest
producer. WTI futures open interest rose to a record in  New York 
yesterday for a third time.  “The inventory numbers showed a much bigger build and,
fundamentally, we should go down,” said Tariq Zahir, a New
York-based commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital Advisors.
“Chavez’s death didn’t really have an impact in the market but
I do think we have to watch to see which kind of government does
come out there.”  WTI for April delivery declined 39 cents to settle at
$90.43 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures
dropped to as low as $89.55 a barrel after the inventory report
was released at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington . Prices have tumbled 14
percent in the past year. Volume was 1.7 percent above the 100-
day average for the time of day at 4 p.m.  Brent for April settlement fell 55 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $111.06 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Volume was 27 percent above the 100-day average.  U.S. Supplies  Oil stockpiles rose to 381.4 million barrels in the week
ended March 1, the most since June 29, the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm, reported. Supplies at Cushing,
 Oklahoma , the delivery point for WTI, gained 257,000 barrels to
50.8 million.  Refinery  utilization  decreased 2.9 percentage points from
the previous week to 82.2 percent, the lowest level since March
16, 2012. The operating rate was forecast to rise 0.4 percentage
point in the Bloomberg survey of analysts.  Distillate supplies, which include heating oil and diesel,
dropped 3.83 million barrels to 120.4 million, and gasoline
inventories fell 616,000 barrels to 227.9 million. They were
each forecast to slide 1 million barrels.  “There is a pretty big drop in refinery run rates,” said
 Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Whenever we see refinery rates drop
below 85 percent, usually we see draws in the products.”  Refinery Utilization  Refinery units are often idled for maintenance in February
and March as attention shifts away from heating oil and before
gasoline consumption rises during the summer months.  Oil also fell as the euro weakened as much as 0.5 percent
to $1.2983. A weaker euro and stronger dollar reduce oil’s
appeal as an investment alternative.  “The dollar put pressure on oil today,” McGillian said.  Venezuela  faces political infighting and the risk of unrest
after the death of Chavez, whose personal brand of socialism
left the region’s biggest oil exporter polarized and among the
world’s most violent countries. The former paratrooper’s death
yesterday, after 14 years in office, opens up a void, even after
the cancer-stricken leader in December urged supporters to elect
Vice President  Nicolas Maduro  to succeed him if he couldn’t
fulfill a term that began Jan. 10.  U.S. crude imports from Venezuela, OPEC’s fourth-largest
producer, totaled 549,000 barrels in the week ended Feb. 22,
down 44 percent from a year earlier, EIA  data  showed. U.S.
domestic output rose to as much as 7.12 million barrels a day in
February, the most since 1992. U.S. output slipped to 7.09
million barrels a day last week, the EIA reported.  Chavez’s Death  “U.S. production is big enough to absorb whatever losses
may come from Venezuela,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market
strategist at Confluence Investment Management in  St. Louis ,
which oversees $1.4 billion. “You may see some unrest, and it
will probably have some adverse effects on oil production. For
the most part it should be a short-term bullish factor.”  Venezuela pumped 2.38 million barrels of oil a day in
January, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said
in a monthly report Feb. 12, citing secondary sources. That put
the country sixth in the group in terms of production, behind
 Saudi Arabia ,  Iraq ,  Kuwait ,  Iran  and the  United Arab Emirates .  Venezuela produced as much as 3.52 million barrels a day of
oil in 1997, according to the EIA. Output has declined since
Chavez became president in 1999, falling to as low as 2.38
million in 2010.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 483,715
contracts as of 4 p.m. It totaled 483,681 contracts yesterday,
9.8 percent below the three-month average. Open interest was a
record 1.71 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
