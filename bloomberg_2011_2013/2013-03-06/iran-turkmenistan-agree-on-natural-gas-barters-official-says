Iran  and  Turkmenistan  reached an
agreement for the Persian Gulf country to export goods to
Turkmenistan in exchange for some of the natural gas it
purchases from its northern neighbor, a trade official said.  Iran buys about $3 billion of natural gas from Turkmenistan
a year, Abdol-Hamid Asadian, head of the Trade Promotion
Organisation’s bureau for Europe and Americas, was quoted as
saying by the state-run  Iranian Students News Agency . The report
didn’t provide details of the arrangement.  Tightening banking and energy sanctions against Iran over
its nuclear program have complicated financial transactions with
the Persian Gulf country. New U.S. sanctions that came into
force last month aim to make buyers of Iranian oil pay in their
local currencies, with the funds kept in escrow accounts and
available for Iran only to buy locally sourced goods and
services.  Iran imports about 18 million cubic meters of gas a day
from Turkmenistan, and as much as 30 million cubic meters in
winter months, state-run media reported in November. The nation,
holder of the world’s second-largest gas deposits, imported 10.2
billion cubic meters from Turkmenistan in 2011 and exported 8.4
billion cubic meters to  Turkey , according to the BP Plc
Statistical Review of World Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
