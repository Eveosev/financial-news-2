The  Detroit  City Council voted today
to appeal Michigan Governor Rick Snyder’s declaration that would
let him install an emergency financial manager, an aide to
President Pro Tem Gary Brown said.  The appeal will be heard in Lansing at 10 a.m. March 12,
Marcel Hurt, Brown’s policy director, said in a telephone
interview.  Snyder declared March 4 that Detroit is in a financial
emergency with no satisfactory plan to reverse it, a step
allowing the appointment of an official to take charge of
finances.  Mayor Dave Bing said in a statement that while he agrees
with the council that the city has a plan to stabilize its
finances, an emergency manager will probably be named.  “The fighting must stop now,” Bing said in the e-mailed
statement. “We need to end the drama and infighting and
understand that whether we like it or not, an emergency
financial manager is coming to Detroit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
