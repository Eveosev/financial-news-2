New England  Patriots wide receiver
 Wes Welker  plans to test free agency before deciding whether to
re-sign with the team, ESPN reported.  Welker, an unrestricted free agent and two-time All-Pro
who’s played his last six National Football League seasons with
the Patriots, has no plans to re-sign until after free agency
begins on March 12,  ESPN said , citing an unidentified person in
the league.  The 31-year-old Welker made $9.5 million last season after
being given the Patriots’ franchise tag and would have received
a 20 percent raise if franchised again, which New England opted
not to do, according to the website.  Welker had 118 catches for 1,354 yards and six touchdowns
as the Patriots went 12-4 during the 2012 regular season before
falling to the Baltimore Ravens in the American Football
Conference championship game. He had eight catches for 117 yards
and a touchdown in that game.  Patriots quarterback  Tom Brady  extended his own contract
last month in a move that improved the team’s flexibility to
sign players such as Welker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
