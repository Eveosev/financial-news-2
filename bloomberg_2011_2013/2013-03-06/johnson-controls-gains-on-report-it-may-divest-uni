Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI) , the largest
U.S. auto-parts maker, soared the most in more than a year after
Reuters reported the Milwaukee-based company is exploring a
possible sale of its interiors business.  Johnson Controls gained 5.5 percent to $33.57 at 2:23 p.m.
after earlier rising 8.3 percent, the biggest intraday gain
since Nov. 30, 2011.  The parts-maker is considering a sale so it can concentrate
on higher-profit building controls and battery businesses,
Reuters said, citing three people familiar with the matter that
it didn’t identify. An e-mail and telephone message seeking
comment from Fraser Engerman, a Johnson Controls spokesman,
weren’t immediately returned.  Johnson Controls got 51 percent of its $42 billion in
revenue in fiscal 2012 from its auto parts unit, which makes
seats, door panels and infotainment systems. The company also
makes auto batteries and equipment for managing building
climates and security.  The company on Jan. 18 projected earnings per share of 40
cents to 42 cents for the quarter ending March 31, citing a
slump in the European auto market. The average estimate at the
time of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit of 52
cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
