Spain’s governing People’s Party
began legal action against El Pais newspaper over reports that
senior officials received cash payments from a slush fund
managed by the former party treasurer.  Former ministers Angel Acebes, Rodrigo Rato, Javier Arenas
and Jaime Mayor Oreja have taken similar action and have
demanded 500,000 euros ($650,000) in compensation, the party
said in a statement today. The PP will also sue the person who
gave the newspaper handwritten accounts allegedly documenting
the payments when that person is identified, according to the
statement.  The publication of the claims “clearly shows the
questionable and inexistent professional rigor” of the
newspaper, the party said. The information was “inappropriately
extracted from documents that were false and very probably
manipulated.”  El Pais on Jan. 31 published ledgers that it said were kept
by former party finance chief Luis Barcenas and purported to
show cash payments to Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy as well as
former ministers such as Acebes and Rato. Barcenas filed an
affidavit with a notary in  Madrid  in December stating he kept
details of contributions and payments to officials from 1994 to
2009, El Pais reported last month.  The PP said Barcenas has told prosecutors that the papers
were fake. PP officials, including Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy,
have denied any wrongdoing.  A spokeswoman for the newspaper declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
