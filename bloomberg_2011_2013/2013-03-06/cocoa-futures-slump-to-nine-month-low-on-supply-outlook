Cocoa futures fell to a nine-month
low on speculation that supplies will increase in  Ivory Coast ,
the world’s top producer. Cotton gained, while coffee, orange
juice and sugar dropped.  AccuWeather Inc., based in  State College ,  Pennsylvania ,
said in a report that Ivory Coast will get 0.5 inch of rain a
day on average through March 8, bolstering cocoa crops. Money
managers and other large speculators cut bets on a rally by 14
percent to 12,571 futures and options as of Feb. 26, the lowest
since July, the latest government  data  showed on March 1.  “Fundamentally speaking, rain in the Ivory Coast forecast
is looked upon as bearish,” John Caruso, a senior commodity
broker at RJO Futures in  Chicago , said in an e-mail.
“Commercial traders are unwinding long bets.”  Cocoa for May delivery dropped 0.8 percent to close at
$2,042 a metric ton at 11:58 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. Earlier,
the price touched $2,038, the lowest for a most-active contract
since June 4. The commodity has dropped 8.7 percent this year,
while  inventory  monitored by the exchange climbed 16 percent.  Cotton futures for May delivery advanced 0.3 percent to
87.23 cents a pound at 1:01 p.m. in  New York . Earlier, the price
reached 87.59 cents, the highest since May 7.  Arabica-coffee futures for May delivery dropped 0.1 percent
to $1.4105 a pound.  Orange-juice futures for May delivery fell 0.8 percent to
$1.225 a pound.  Raw-sugar futures for May delivery declined 0.2 percent to
