Lithuania’s state-owned railway
company  Lietuvos Gelezinkeliai  faces a European Union antitrust
probe for removing a rail link that may have blocked rival
services.  The European Commission said it would investigate whether
the 2008 dismantling of a railway track between Lithuania and
 Latvia  limited competition for railway freight. Regulators
raided the company in 2011 after oil refinery Orlen Lietuva AB
complained that the track’s removal increased its transport
fees. The refinery, controlled by Poland’s  PKN Orlen SA (PKN) ,
transports about 90 percent of its production by rail.  The track was removed because Lithuanian railroad
inspectors said its poor condition could cause an accident,
Lithuanian Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius told reporters
today in Vilnius, according to a report by Baltic News Service.
Lietuvos Gelezinkeliai’s lawyers are preparing a statement on
the probe, which will be published tomorrow, the newswire said,
citing a company spokesman.  Vidmantas Gudas, a spokesman for Lietuvos Gelezinkeliai,
and the company’s switchboard didn’t pick up calls from
 Bloomberg News  seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
