Harry Winston Diamond Corp. (HWD) , a watch
and jewelry retailer that’s selling its luxury retail unit to
 Swatch Group AG (UHR) , will raise jewelry prices in Japan as the yen’s
drop to a three-year low makes imports more expensive.  The increase will be applied from March 22 to jewelry, not
watches, the Japanese luxury retail unit of the Toronto-based
company said in an e-mail. The message didn’t say how much
prices would rise.  The diamond retailer’s price jump follows that of  LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , which raised prices by a record last
month for its flagship brand in Japan, the world’s largest
luxury market after the U.S. Louis Vuitton added an average of
12 percent to prices of certain categories items in Japan
starting Feb. 15 to offset the yen’s depreciation.  “Other brands may also raise some prices because of the
weakening yen,” said Mikihiko Yamato, deputy head of research
for JI Asia in Tokyo. “It’s easier for branded goods makers to
pass costs along. People who want them want them no matter
what.”  Harry Winston got about 12 percent of revenue from Japan in
the year ended January 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The Japanese currency weakened to 94.77 yen versus the
dollar last month, the lowest since May 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
