The zloty depreciated the most in
six weeks after the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate
by 50 basis points, beating expectations.  The zloty retreated as much as 0.9 percent against the euro
after the decision, the most since January 28, and traded 0.4
percent weaker at 4.1558 at 5:36 p.m. in Warsaw. The yield on
two-year bonds dropped nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage
point, to 3.47 percent.  Poland’s central bank cut rates by 50 basis points, or 0.5
percentage point, to a record low of 3.25 percent. It was the
fifth reduction in as many months and the first of more than 25
basis points. The bank is taking a “wait-and-see” approach,
Governor Marek Belka said at a news conference in Warsaw today.  “What we heard was an announcement that you should not
expect rate cuts for a long period of time, so the potential for
yields going down seems limited,” Wojciech Labryga, who helps
manage 9.5 billion zloty in assets at PKO BP PTE pension fund in
Warsaw, said by phone.  “Given that the central bank practically closed the door
on further cuts, we believe that the market will draw a line on
the rate cuts story and look at the -- now even more compelling
-- growth outperformance story for Poland versus Central and
Eastern Europe,” Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc analysts
Roderick Ngotho and Abbas Ameli-Renani wrote in a note.
