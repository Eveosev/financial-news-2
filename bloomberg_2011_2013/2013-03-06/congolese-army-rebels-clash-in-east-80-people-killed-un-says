At least 80 people were killed in
eastern  Democratic Republic  of Congo in fighting between the
army and a rebel group during the past week, the United Nations
mission in the country said.  Rebels from the Alliance of Patriots for a Free and
Sovereign Congo, known by the French acronym APCLS, clashed with
the army in the town of Kitchanga about 1,600 kilometers (1,000
miles) east of Kinshasa, leaving more than 100 wounded and
burning at least 50 homes, Colonel Felix Basse, military
spokesman for the UN mission, told reporters in the capital. The
fighting began Feb. 27 after the killing of an ethnic-Tutsi
civilian and soldier, Basse said.  “This provoked all this inflamed violence that we’ve seen
for a week in Kitchanga,” he said.  The APCLS are a mainly ethnic-Hunde militia based in North
Kivu province formed to protect community land rights and oppose
the expansion of ethnic-Hutu and Tutsi dominance in the region,
according to a 2011 UN experts report on Congo. Both Hutu and
Tutsi speak the language of neighboring  Rwanda  and some militia
in eastern Congo consider them foreigners. M23, the most
powerful rebel group in North Kivu, is mainly led by Tutsis.  The UN used attack helicopters against the APCLS rebels and
the army forced them out of Kitchanga on March 4, according to
Basse. About 100,000 civilians have been forced to flee their
homes, according to the UN’s humanitarian agency.  APCLS rebels were in the area to begin reintegrating into
the national army when the fighting began, Basse said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
