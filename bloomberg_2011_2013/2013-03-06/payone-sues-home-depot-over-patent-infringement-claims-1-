Home Depot Inc. (HD)  was sued by PayOne
Corp. over claims the largest U.S. home-improvement retailer is
infringing patents for the processing of payment transactions
and validating subscriber lines.  PayOne, formerly known as PaymentOne, wrote to Atlanta-
based Home Depot in November to notify the company of the
infringement, according a complaint filed yesterday in federal
court in San Jose, California.  Home Depot infringed a patent at issue by offering PayPal’s
In-Store Checkout System as a payment option, according to the
complaint. PayOne, based in San Jose, owns a system that allows
consumers to charge digital purchases to mobile, broadband or
home phone bills, according to its website.  Home Depot spokesman Steve Holmes said yesterday he hadn’t
seen the suit yet.  The case is PaymentOne Corp. v. Home Depot Inc., 13-
cv-0993, U.S. District Court, Northern District of  California 
(San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
