New Amsterdam Capital Management
LLP,  a London-based money manager founded in 2002, is seeking to
raise its first European collateralized loan obligation since
2008.  The firm is in talks with banks to raise a 300 million-euro
($391 million) CLO by the end of this year, John Seal, a London-
based founding partner of New Amsterdam, said in a telephone
interview.  New Amsterdam is among money managers seeking to revive CLO
issuance in Europe as the average spread on top-rated portions
of the funds tightened to 150 basis points on Feb. 22 from 300
basis points a year ago, according to Wells Fargo & Co. Last
month Cairn Capital Ltd. priced a 300.5 million-euro CLO, the
first deal in  Europe  since 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Pramerica Investment Management Ltd. hired Barclays
Plc to raise a 300 million-euro fund.  “We have investors interested in the equity piece of a new
CLO and this really only started to happen about four months
ago,” Seal said. “It’s a very encouraging sign. The key to
success will be sourcing a sufficient amount of assets in a
timely fashion.”  The quarterly cash payment to the so-called equity piece,
or the riskiest portion, of European CLOs rose to an average of
about 3.1 percent last year, the most since 2008, according to
Citigroup Inc. CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation
that pool high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into
securities of varying risk and return. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  New Amsterdam raised 825 million euros in 2006 for its
Mercator I and Mercator II CLOs and 300 million euros for
Mercator III in 2007, Bloomberg data show. It sold about 640
million euros of bonds for NAC EuroLoan CLO in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
