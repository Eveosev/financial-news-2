Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai rose for a second day after the contract’s premium to
spot prices narrowed.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange advanced as much as 0.7 percent to 3,966  yuan  ($637) a
metric ton and traded at 3,941 yuan at 10:15 a.m. local time.
The average spot  price  for rebar fell 0.3 percent yesterday to
3,776 yuan a ton, according to data from Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  “The rebar futures premium over the spot market price has
narrowed recently, a bullish sign which may boost users’
purchases as they usually stock up amid anticipation for the
rising consumption in March and April,” Cao Yanghui and Wang
Tieshan, analysts at Nanhua Futures Co., said in a report.  The premium was 163 yuan at yesterday’s close for the
October contract versus the spot price, compared with 263 yuan
at the end of last month.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery fell 2.4 percent to $145.20
