  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL)  Chief
Executive Officer Peter J. Coleman said he’s “confident” of
closing the $696 million purchase of a stake in Israel’s largest
natural gas field from  Noble Energy Inc. (NBL)   The Leviathan natural gas project purchase doesn’t appear
to violate Israeli law, Coleman said today in a press conference
at IHS CERAWeek in Houston. Woodside agreed to buy a 30 percent
stake in the project from Noble in December.  Noble partner  Delek Group Ltd. (DLEKG)  fell the most in more than
nine months today on investor concern the nation’s antitrust
regulator may declare the partners in Leviathan a cartel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
