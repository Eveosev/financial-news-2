The  New York  Yankees will be without
Mark Teixeira for eight to 10 weeks after the first baseman
strained a tendon in his right wrist while taking swings in a
batting cage.  The 32-year-old Teixeira will need four weeks of complete
rest, Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said on ESPN New
York 98.7 last night. He said he didn’t know who would take
Teixeira’s place.  Teixeira was injured two days ago while practicing with the
U.S. squad for the World Baseball Classic.  Teixeira has averaged 32 home runs and 101 runs batted in
since 2010. He batted .251 with 24 homers and 84 RBI last season,
his fourth with the Yankees.  Also during spring training, outfielder Curtis Granderson
broke his arm and is out for two months. Pitcher Phil Hughes has
a bulging disk in his upper back and shortstop Derek Jeter is
recovering from the broken ankle he sustained in last year’s
playoffs. Third baseman Alex Rodriguez is out until midseason
following hip surgery.  Cashman himself broke his ankle during a charity skydiving
exhibition this week.  The Yankees open their 2013 Major League Baseball campaign
April 1 versus the Boston Red Sox.  To contact the reporter on this story:
