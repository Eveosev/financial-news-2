Stocks rose, extending the Dow Jones
Industrial Average’s record high, as a private report showed
faster-than-forecast U.S. job growth and the Federal Reserve
said the economy is growing. Oil slid as U.S. inventories rose.  The Dow added 42.47 points, or 0.3 percent, to 14,296.24 at
4 p.m. in New York. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.1
percent to 1,541.46, while oil lost as much as 1.4 percent to
trade below $90 a barrel for the second time this year.  Brazil 
shares rallied the most since July. Ten-year U.S. Treasury
yields added four basis points to 1.94 percent. Spanish 10-year
 borrowing costs  dropped 3.5 basis points to 5.01 percent.
Venezuelan bonds slid after President Hugo Chavez died.  The S&P 500 closed about 1.5 percent below its record today
after the Dow’s move yesterday erased losses from the financial
crisis. A private report from ADP Research Institute showed
employers added 198,000 jobs last month, topping the median
economist forecast for 170,000 and bolstering optimism before
the government’s labor report on March 8. The U.S. economy grew
at a modest to moderate pace across most of the country amid
rising consumer demand for homes and autos, the Fed said in its
Beige Book survey.  “The market’s responding to some degree to fundamentals,”
Stephen Wood, who helps manage about $163 billion as New York-
based chief market strategist for North America at Russell
Investments, said by telephone. “The economy is growing, albeit
at a frustrating pace,” he said. “We’re seeing housing begin
to contribute rather significantly to the economy.”  ‘Positive Implications’  The 198,000 increase in employment reported by ADP followed
a revised 215,000 gain the prior month that was more than
initially estimated. Government data in two days are forecast to
show private payrolls grew by 170,000 jobs and the unemployment
rate held steady at 7.9 percent, according to the median
estimates of economists.  “ADP was better than expected, last month was revised up,
that has positive implications for the jobs number Friday,”
 Philip Orlando , chief equity strategist at Federated Investors,
which has about $380 billion in assets under management, said by
telephone.  U.S. stocks climbed yesterday after the Institute for
Supply Management’s index of non-manufacturing businesses, which
covers about 90 percent of the U.S. economy, increased to 56
last month, its highest level in a year. Yesterday’s rally was
also triggered after China’s government said it will keep its
economic growth target at 7.5 percent for this year and plans a
10 percent jump in fiscal spending.  U.S. Movers  Among stocks moving today, Bank of America Corp. rose 3.2
percent to pace gains among financial shares. VeriFone Systems
Inc. increased 8.6 percent as the maker of credit-card terminals
reported earnings that beat its forecasts. Staples Inc. fell 7.2
percent after forecasting profit that was less than analysts
estimated.  Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold Inc. jumped 4.1 percent. The
world’s second-largest copper miner may double sales of copper
concentrate to  China  in the next three years as mined production
expands, according to Javier Targhetta, the company’s senior
vice president of marketing and sales.  About $10 trillion has been restored to U.S. equities since
the bear-market low on March 9, 2009, fueled by the fastest
profit growth since the 1990s and monetary stimulus from the
Federal Reserve. Retailers, banks and manufacturers led the
recovery from the worst bear market since the 1930s as the Dow
took less than 65 months to rise above its previous high set on
Oct. 9, 2007, more than a year faster than the recovery from the
Internet bubble.  The S&P 500 has jumped 128 percent from its bear-market low
four years ago. The index trades for 15.2 times reported
earnings, compared with a multiple of 17.5 when it reached its
record in October 2007.  ‘Turning Point’  “The good news is we do not seem to be anywhere close to
the kind of cyclical turning point we were on the cusp of in
October 2007, suggesting the stock market may have more room to
run,” Julia Coronado, chief North America economist for BNP
Paribas SA in New York, wrote in a report. “However, the bad
news is that we do not have anything like the kind of robust
growth dynamic that had led us to a cyclical peak.”  Brazil’s Bovespa rose 3.6 percent, the most since July 27.
Voting shares of Petrobras soared 9 percent, the biggest gain
since December 2008, after the state-controlled oil producer
said the government unexpectedly approved a 5 percent increase
in diesel prices.  Wheat, corn, lead and zinc also dropped at least 1.5
percent to lead the S&P GSCI Index down 0.7 percent. Copper fell
to a 15-week low, slumping 0.6 percent to $3.493 a pound, as
rising inventories and a drop in U.S. factory orders fueled
demand concerns.  ‘Bigger Build’  Oil dropped for the fourth time in five days, settling 0.4
percent lower at $90.43 a barrel, after the Energy Information
Administration said supplies rose 3.83 million barrels, more
than four times the 788,000-barrel median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of analysts.  “The inventory numbers showed a much bigger build and
fundamentally, we should go down,” said Tariq Zahir, a New
York-based commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital Advisors.
“Chavez’s death didn’t really have an impact in the market but
I do think we have to watch to see which kind of government does
come out there.”  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  erased early gains to close down
0.2 percent. Gross domestic product in the 17-nation euro bloc
fell 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter, the European Union’s
statistics office said today, confirming an initial Feb. 14
estimate.  Vodafone, Admiral  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  surged 6.8 percent after people familiar
with the situation said Verizon Communications Inc. is working
to resolve its relationship with Vodafone this year, with
options under consideration including an end to their wireless
joint venture and a full merger of the two companies.  Admiral Group Plc (ADM) , the U.K. motor insurer that owns the
confused.com website, climbed 5.3 percent to a 17-month high as
full-year profit beat estimates. Edenred slid 4.5 percent as
investment firm Eurazeo SA sold a 10 percent stake in the French
provider of prepaid voucher programs.  The six-day advance for Spanish bonds is the longest run
since August. Italian securities also rose, with 10-year yields
dropping eight basis points to 4.66 percent.  The yield on German 10-year bunds,  Europe ’s benchmark
government securities, rose less than one basis point to 1.46
percent. U.S. The Swiss franc weakened against 14 of 16 major
peers, falling 0.3 percent to 1.2314 per euro and declining 0.7
percent to 94.75 centimes per dollar, amid reduced demand for
haven currencies.  Chavez Dies  Venezuela ’s dollar-denominated bonds fell for a second day.
President Chavez died following a battle with cancer and his
deputy stepped in to run the country, South America’s biggest
oil exporter.  The yield on the $4 billion of notes maturing in 2027 rose
to 9.12 percent, the highest since Jan. 22, after Vice President
Nicolas Maduro said on state television that Chavez died at a
military hospital in Caracas and urged Venezuelans to refrain
from violence.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  rose 0.9 percent, led by
commodity, financial and industrial stocks.  Kenya ’s shilling
slumped against 14 of 16 major peers as results from
presidential elections on March 4 were delayed. The currency of
East Africa’s biggest economy weakened 1.7 percent versus the
dollar.  Australia ’s dollar advanced against 12 of 16 major
counterparts. The nation’s fourth-quarter GDP advanced 0.6
percent from the previous three months, when it rose a revised
0.7 percent that was higher than initially reported, a Bureau of
Statistics report released in Sydney today showed. The result
matched the median of 28 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
