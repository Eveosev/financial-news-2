U.K. stocks  were little changed near
a five-year high as  Vodafone (VOD)  Group Plc rallied, offsetting a
report that showed U.S. factory orders fell in January.  Vodafone jumped the most in four years as people familiar
with the matter said Verizon Communications Inc. is seeking to
resolve its relationship with the carrier.  Admiral (ADM)  Group Plc
climbed to a 17-month high after posting full-year profit that
beat analysts’ estimates. Associated British Foods Plc slipped
1.1 percent after Exane BNP Paribas downgraded the shares.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  retreated 4.31 points, or 0.1 percent,
to 6,427.64 at the close in London. Shares dropped in the last
half an hour of trading, paring an earlier advance of as much as
0.5 percent. The equity benchmark has still  rallied 9 percent 
this year, and yesterday jumped to the highest level since
January 2008 on optimism central banks around the world will
continue with stimulus measures.  The broader FTSE All-Share Index rose less than 0.1 percent
today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index slid 1.5 percent. The volume
of shares changing hands in companies on the FTSE 100 was 39
percent greater than the average of the past 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton Ltd., Shire Plc, CRH Plc and
TUI Travel Plc are trading without the rights to dividend today.  Orders to U.S. factories fell in January, weighed down by a
slump in demand for military hardware and commercial aircraft.  Bookings dropped 2 percent after a revised 1.3 percent
increase in December, figures from the Commerce Department
showed today in  Washington . Economists projected a 2.2 percent
decline, according to the  median forecast  in a Bloomberg survey.  ADP Data  In the U.S., companies added 198,000 workers in February,
according to a private report based on payrolls. The increase in
employment followed a revised 215,000 gain the prior month,
figures from the Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Research
Institute showed today. The median forecast of 41 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for an advance of 170,000.  Vodafone surged 6.8 percent to 180 pence, the most since
February 2009. The U.K. mobile operator and Verizon have weighed
options that range from ending their wireless venture to a full
merger of the two companies, according to people familiar with
the matter.  The two phone companies have discussed a range of options,
including the idea of  Verizon (VZ)  acquiring 100 percent of their
U.S. wireless partnership, the people said. Vodafone’s 45
percent stake in the venture, called  Verizon Wireless , could
fetch $115 billion, according to analysts.  Admiral, Melrose  Admiral advanced 5.3 percent to 1,334 pence, its highest
price since September 2011, as the U.K. motor insurer said 2012
pretax profit climbed 15 percent to 345 million pounds ($522
million). That beat the 331.7 million-pound average estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Melrose Industries Plc (MRO)  climbed 2.7 percent to 267.1 pence
after saying it’s confident about the outlook for 2013. The
owner of Brush Turbogenerators reported full-year pretax profit
of 214.3 million pounds, exceeding the average analyst estimate
of 197 million pounds in a Bloomberg survey.  Legal & General Group Plc (LGEN)  rose 2 percent to 166 pence after
the biggest manager of U.K. pension assets raised its dividend
by 20 percent. The full-year payout will be 7.65 pence a share,
the London-based insurer said today in a statement, beating the
7.43 pence average estimate of 21 analysts, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  AB Foods (ABF) , which owns the Primark discount-clothing chain,
fell 21 pence to 1,845 pence. Exane lowered its recommendation
on the shares to underperform, the equivalent of sell, from
neutral, saying the stock’s strong rally warrants some
consolidation. AB Foods has surged 18 percent so far this year
and closed yesterday at the highest level since at least 1986.  To contact the reporter on this story:
