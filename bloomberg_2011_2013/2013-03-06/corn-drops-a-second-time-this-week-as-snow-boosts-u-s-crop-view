Wheat futures fell to the lowest
since June as rain boosted prospects for the U.S. winter crop
set to emerge from dormancy. Corn prices tumbled the most in
five months.  As much as six times the normal amount of  precipitation 
fell in the past two weeks from south-central  Kansas  through
 Oklahoma  and in the Texas Panhandle, National Weather Service
data show. Kansas wheat was rated 24 percent good or excellent
as of March 3, up 1 percentage point from a week earlier, and 16
percent of Oklahoma crops got top ratings, up from 9 percent,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said on March 4.  “Crop conditions are improving,”  Brian Hoops , the
president of Midwest Market Solutions in Springfield, Missouri,
said in a telephone interview. “As the plants start coming out
of dormancy, people are more optimistic because of the moisture
that has fallen.”  Wheat futures for May delivery fell 3.2 percent to settle
at $6.8375 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
biggest drop since Dec. 11. Earlier, the price touched $6.80,
the lowest for a most-active contract since June 22.  On the Kansas City Board of Trade, wheat futures for May
delivery slumped 2.8 percent to $7.245 a bushel, the lowest
settlement since June 22. The drop was the biggest since Oct.
12.  Kansas City wheat has slid 13 percent this year, and the
 Chicago  price has declined 12 percent, the most among 24  raw
materials  in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  Corn futures for May delivery fell 2.9 percent to $6.885 a
bushel in Chicago, the largest decline since Sept. 17.  Soybean futures for May delivery dropped less than 0.1
percent to $14.66 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
