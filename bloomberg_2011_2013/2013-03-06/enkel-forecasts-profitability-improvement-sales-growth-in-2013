Henkel AG forecast sales growth of
at least 3 percent and higher profitability this year as the
German maker of Loctite glues and Persil detergent gains an
increasing share of revenue from  emerging markets .  Sales will rise as much as 5 percent in 2013, Dusseldorf-
based Henkel said today. Earnings before interest and taxes as a
proportion of revenue will widen to as much as 14.5 percent,
topping the 14.1 percent margin reported today for 2012.  The guidance was “reasonably challenging, but still
beatable,”  Andrew Wood , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein,
said in an e-mailed report. “If management delivers these
results, we would expect continued positive stock momentum.”  Emerging markets such as eastern Europe,  Africa ,  Latin
America  and  Asia  accounted for 43 percent of sales last year, up
from 42 percent in 2011. That helped reduce Henkel’s reliance on
western Europe, where government austerity measures taken to
counter the debt crisis deepened a recession.  “Business performance was particularly successful in
emerging markets, with Asia excluding  Japan  standing out through
strong double-digit growth, thanks to substantial expansion of
business in  China ” in 2012, the company said.  Henkel shares gained as much as 3.2 percent, the biggest
intraday increase since Jan. 25. The stock traded 2.9 percent
higher at 70.65 euros as of 11:56 a.m. in  Frankfurt .  New Products  The 2013 targets helped offset fourth-quarter profit that
missed estimates. Earnings before interest and taxes, adjusted
for one-time items, rose 8.4 percent to 544 million euros ($710
million) in the quarter, Henkel said. That compared with the 555
million-euro average of nine analysts estimates in a Bloomberg
survey. Adjusted net income gained 13 percent to 377 million
euros, also missing analyst predictions.  “Margins came in below our expectations, and slightly
below consensus,” Bernstein’s Wood said.  Revenue gained 5.3 percent to 4 billion euros, the company
said. Like-for-like growth was 4 percent, exceeding the 3.2
percent average of six estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  On an organic basis, which excludes the effects of
acquisitions, disposals and currency shifts, cosmetics revenue
rose 2.1 percent and adhesives sales gained 4.6 percent. Organic
growth in the laundry and home-care business, which sells
products such as Silan Royal fabric softener, was 4.7 percent.  Innovation Pipeline  Henkel said today that 42 percent of 2012  sales  were
generated from products introduced in the last three years.
Those included a Schwarzkopf hair colorant in a jar and a new
pre-dosed liquid detergent under the Persil brand.  Henkel has a “very strong innovation pipeline” for 2013,
Chief Executive Officer Kasper Rorsted told analysts today on a
conference call.  The company is also “actively” managing its portfolio to
exit some businesses, Chief Financial Officer Carsten Knobel
told analysts. About 500 million euros in revenue comes from
non-strategic products, he estimates. Henkel’s top 10 brands
account for 44 percent of sales and it has cut the number of
brands it sells to less than 400 from about 1,000 in 2008.  The market environment for professional hair-care, which
includes products such as the Bonacure hair oil or Igora
colorant for streaks, is “tough,” especially in western
 Europe , Rorsted said.  The electronics market, which Henkel supplies with
adhesives, remains “very slow” and a “significant” recovery
in the first half is not expected, he said. Henkel gets about
half its revenue from adhesives.  Acquisitions  The company said today that net debt fell to 85 million
euros from 1.39 billion euros at the end of 2011, while free
cashflow doubled to a record 2.02 billion euros.  Acquisitions are “an integrated part of the company’s
strategy,” Knobel said.  Between 2008 and 2012, non-core divestments and disposals
amounted to 2 billion euros while additions and extensions to
the existing portfolio reached 4 billion euros, Henkel said.  The company proposed a dividend of 95 euro cents per
preferred share, a 19 percent increase from last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
