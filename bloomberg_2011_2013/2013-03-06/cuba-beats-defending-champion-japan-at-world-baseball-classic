Cuba defeated two-time defending
champion  Japan  6-3 to complete its first-round group play at the
 World Baseball Classic .  Yasmany Tomas hit a  third-inning home run  and Alfredo
Despaigne added a three-run homer in the eighth inning today at
the Japan Dome in Fukuoka as Cuba finished 3-0 in Group A. Japan
advanced to the second round with a 2-1 record.  Cuba will play the Netherlands (2-1) tomorrow in Tokyo,
while Japan faces Taiwan, which finished atop Group B with a 2-1
record, the following day. Second-round play is a double-
elimination format and Cuba could play Japan again on March 10
if both win their next games.  The U.S. team comprised of Major League Baseball players
has the first of its  opening-round  Pool D games in two days
against Mexico in Phoenix. Toronto Blue Jays knuckleballer R.A. Dickey, the reigning National League Cy Young Award-winner, will
be the opening-game starting pitcher for the American team. Ryan Vogelsong of the San Francisco Giants and  Derek Holland  of the
Texas Rangers will pitch the next two games, against Italy on
March 9 and Canada on March 10.  Pool C play begins tomorrow in San Juan,  Puerto Rico , where
Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Spain and Puerto Rico are
grouped.  The first teams eliminated from the tournament were Brazil
and China in Pool A, and Australia and  South Korea  in Pool B.  To contact the reporter on this story:
