Orient Overseas (International)
Ltd. (316) , owner of  Hong Kong ’s biggest container line, posted a 63
percent increase in full-year profit that beat analyst estimates
as freight rates rose.  Net income  climbed to $296.4 million from $181.6 million a
year earlier, the shipping line said in a statement to Hong
Kong’s stock exchange yesterday. That surpassed the  $275.7
million average  of 20 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Sales rose 7.4 percent to $6.46 billion.  Shipping lines including  A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S (MAERSKB) ’s
container-shipping line, the world’s biggest, have started
raising rates to offset higher fuel costs and recover from
industrywide losses in 2011 because of a vessel glut. Orient
Overseas’s  average rate for moving a container  increased 2.9
percent last year, after a 6.7 percent drop in 2011.  “ Orient Overseas  benefited as a premium player in the
market and through effective cost controls,” said Lawrence Li,
a Shanghai-based analyst at  UOB-Kay Hian Holdings Ltd. (UOBK)  “Looking
ahead, the new bigger vessels it is going to receive may help
reduce” fuel consumption even further, Li said.  The shipping company is due to receive eight vessels this
year that can carry 13,000 20-foot containers and will be used
by the G6 Alliance, Chief Financial Officer Kenneth Cambie told
reporters in Hong Kong yesterday. The shipping line, which had a
fleet of 98 container vessels at the end of 2012, will also
receive another two ships that can carry 8,888 boxes.  While Maersk is due to take delivery of the world’s biggest
container ship that can carry 18,000 boxes in June, Orient
Overseas needs to run larger vessels to be competitive, Cambie
said.  Young Fleet  “Trades are moving to very large vessels” and the focus
is on reducing average slot costs, Cambie said. The company has
no plans to idle or scrap ships as the fleet is young, he said.  Total  bunker  costs for the line were unchanged at $1.21
billion in 2012, even as average fuel prices rose 6 percent.  Freight rates were seasonally low after the Chinese New
Year holiday in February, and Orient Overseas expects to effect
rate increases in its contract negotiations with clients through
April and May as in previous years, Cambie said.  The Drewry Hong Kong-Los Angeles 40-foot container rate
benchmark fell 3.9 percent to $2,436 in the week ending Feb. 27,
after holding steady for two straight weeks due to the Lunar New
Year, according to Bloomberg Industries. Rates have jumped 37.5
percent from a year earlier.  Orient Overseas handled 5.22 million 20-foot containers
last year, 3.7 percent higher than a year earlier. That included
1.25 million boxes in the transpacific market and 885,323
containers on the Asia-Europe route.  Final Dividend  The company plans to pay a final  dividend  of 7.18 cents per
share. It didn’t pay final dividend for 2011. The  stock  rose 0.7
percent to HK$55.90 in Hong Kong yesterday, before the earnings
were released.  The Shanghai Containerized Freight Index, a measure of
rates for goods leaving  China ’s busiest port, rose 20 percent
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
