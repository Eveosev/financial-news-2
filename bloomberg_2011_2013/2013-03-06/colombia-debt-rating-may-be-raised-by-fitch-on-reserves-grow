Colombia ’s foreign debt rating may
be raised by  Fitch Ratings  as international reserves rise and
debt levels drop.  Fitch rates Colombia BBB-, the lowest investment-grade
level. The outlook on Colombia’s credit rating was moved to
positive from stable, the agency said in a statement today.  “As a result of continued international reserve
accumulation, Fitch expects Colombia to become a net sovereign
external creditor in 2013,” Fitch said in a statement today.
“In addition, government debt burden continues to decline
driven by fiscal consolidation and economic growth.”  Colombia won an investment-grade credit rating in 2011 for
the first time since 1999 as improved security bolstered
economic growth and attracted record foreign investment.
 Standard & Poor’s  in August also raised its outlook on
Colombia’s BBB- rating to positive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
