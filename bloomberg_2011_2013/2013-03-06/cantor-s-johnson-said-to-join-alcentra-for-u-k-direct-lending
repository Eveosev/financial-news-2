Alcentra Ltd. hired Michael Johnson,
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.’s head of European leveraged capital
markets, to run its U.K. direct lending business, according to a
person with knowledge of the move.  Johnson will report to Graeme Delaney-Smith, head of
European direct lending and mezzanine investments for the
London-based money manager, said the person, who asked not to be
named because the matter is not yet public. Johnson began
working for Alcentra on March 1, the person said.  Alcentra, owned by Bank of  New York  Mellon Corp., is
raising a 500 million-euro ($651.6 million) European direct
lending fund, two people said last month. That fund is separate
from a 200 million-pound ($320 million) pool Alcentra raised in
November to lend to U.K. companies, the people said.  Lending to to mid-sized companies can be “particularly
compelling” to institutional investors, Delaney-Smith said in a
Feb. 19 statement. A pullback by European banks has created an
opportunity for new lenders, Alcentra said.  Mike Dunn, a New York-based spokesman for BNY Mellon,
didn’t immediately comment on the appointment. Officials in
Cantor’s New York press office didn’t reply to an e-mail and
telephone call concerning Johnson’s departure.  To contact the reporters on this story:
