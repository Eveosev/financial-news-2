Gold climbed for a second day as
physical demand picked up and investors weighed the continuation
of stimulus measures by central banks against improving economic
data. Silver, platinum and palladium advanced.  Spot gold gained 0.3 percent to $1,579.65 an ounce at 9:16
a.m. in Singapore, after earlier falling by 0.2 percent. Gold
for April delivery advanced 0.3 percent to $1,578.90 an ounce on
the Comex in New York. Bullion also increased as the  Bank of
Korea  joined Russia and Kazakhstan in adding gold to reserves.  European Central Bank policy makers meet tomorrow after
President  Mario Draghi  signaled last month the bank has no
intention of tightening monetary policy anytime soon. China
yesterday pledged to support economic  expansion  while
maintaining its growth target at 7.5 percent for this year. Data
yesterday showed  service industries  in the U.S. expanded in
February at the fastest pace in a year as Federal Reserve policy
makers remain divided on the pace of stimulus.  “Sentiment towards gold is being driven by how the markets
view monetary policy and economic stimulus,” said Feng Liang,
an analyst at GF Futures Co., a unit of China’s third-biggest
listed brokerage. “Physical buying has been good at current
prices. Central-bank buying remains a supportive backdrop.”  Cash bullion of 99.99 percent purity on the Shanghai Gold
Exchange added 0.1 percent to 320.85  yuan  a gram ($1,603.30 an
ounce). Daily volumes for the benchmark cash contract have been
more than double the average in 2012 since Feb. 18, when it
reached a record 22,024 kilograms, according to exchange data.  Bullion rallied in the past 12 years as central banks
joined investors in adding to holdings after nations from the
U.S. to China pledged more stimulus to bolster economic growth.
 South Korea  boosted  gold reserves  by 24 percent to 104.4 metric
tons in February, the central bank said today.  Cash silver gained 0.3 percent to $28.79 an ounce, spot
platinum climbed 0.6 percent to $1,598.75 an ounce, and
palladium added 0.4 percent to $738.70 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
