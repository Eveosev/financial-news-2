Argentina offered to give up its
claim to the disputed Falkland Islands in 1843 if Britain would
take responsibility for a 1 million-pound loan on which it had
defaulted, according to newly released U.K. government records.  The argument over who owns the islands, 300 miles (500
kilometers) off the coast of Argentina and nearly 8,000 miles
from Britain, dates back 200 years. It led to  war in 1982 , when
Argentina invaded, leading  Margaret Thatcher  to send a military
 task force  to recapture the islands at a cost of more than 900
lives on both sides. Islanders will hold a referendum March 10-
11 to demonstrate their desire to stay British.  In May 1982, as the task force was approaching the islands,
John Orbell, the archivist at Baring Brothers & Co. Ltd. in
London, wrote to the government, enclosing handwritten letters
dated 1843 and 1844, from the Argentine government to the
merchant bank’s representative, who was trying to secure
repayment of an 1824 debt that had been in default for 15 years.  “The letters indicate the willingness of the Argentine
government to cede the Falkland Islands to Britain in settlement
of these claims,” Orbell wrote, adding that the letters contain
“a strong assertion of Argentina’s claim to sovereignty over
the islands.”  Orbell’s letter was passed to Thatcher and was among
documents released this year under regulations providing for the
 publication of government papers  after 30 years.  The Argentine letters, addressed to the company’s agent in
Argentina, Francis Falconnet, are still in the Baring archive,
now owned by ING Groep NV, which bought the bank in 1995 after
its collapse.  Port Funding  According to “The Sixth Great Power: Barings, 1762-1929,”
by Philip Ziegler, Argentina issued the bond in 1824 to fund a
port in  Buenos Aires , running water for the capital and frontier
settlements. The coupon was 6 percent, and the bonds were sold
by Argentina at 70 percent of face value, meaning the government
was effectively paying 8.7 percent interest.  Barings took a fee of 30,000 pounds and a 1 percent
commission on sales. At first, speculators kept the price high.
When they began to dump the securities, Barings bought them and
ended up, according to Ziegler, with “an uncomfortably large
amount of capital locked up in virtually unsalable bonds.”  Argentina initially kept up its interest payments, until
war with  Brazil  drained its revenues and caused a collapse in
its currency. In January 1828, the country had its first default
on its first sovereign loan.  Argentina is currently locked in a court battle in the U.S.
with holders of bonds left over from its record $91 billion
default in late 2001.  No Gunboat  Back in the early 19th century, bondholders in London
realized they had nowhere to turn. Even at a time when Britannia
ruled the waves, Foreign Secretary George Canning had refused to
send a gunboat to  Colombia  to deal with a default there five
years earlier. They simply had to send representatives to Buenos
Aires.  According to Ziegler, Argentina made a series of offers to
settle the debt, starting in 1828 with “a couple of unwanted
frigates,” and moving on in 1831 to land in Patagonia, a
“bleak, southern outpost” where Argentine citizens were
reluctant to settle.  In 1842, Falconnet arrived to reopen negotiations. The
Argentine leader, Juan Manuel de Rosas, told the Barings
representative he wanted to settle the matter, and in 1843 he
offered to drop claims to sovereignty of the Malvinas, as the
Argentines called the Falklands, if the British government would
take over the debt.  Britain refused, on the grounds that the islands were
already British territory. A  first British settlement  had been
established in the Falklands in 1766.  Naval Blockade  Instead, Falconnet persuaded  Argentina  to pay 5,000 silver
dollars a month from 1844, worth about 12,000 pounds a year, a
fifth of what the bondholders were expecting, according to
Ziegler. Even this collapsed the following year, when an Anglo-
French naval force blockaded Buenos Aires harbor. Payments were
finally resumed in 1859, by which time the debt stood at more
than 2.6 million pounds.  By 1871, Argentina was paying interest at 3 percent on the
debt. Far from ending Barings’ troubles in the country, this
resumption encouraged more lending, to fund railroad and land
improvement projects. During the 1880s, close to half of all
British sovereign lending was to Argentina, with by far the most
coming from Barings. When Argentina’s economy ran into trouble
in 1890, Barings was judged too big to fail, and the  Bank of
England  had to organize a bailout.  While Rosas’s offer of the Falklands was rejected by
Britain at the time, from a historical perspective, it looks
attractive. According to the Bank of England’s  inflation
calculator , 1 million pounds in 1824 is equivalent to 108
million pounds in 2012. In the current financial year, the U.K.
government estimates the cost of defending the Falklands, which
have fewer than 3,000 inhabitants, at 61 million pounds ($92 
million).  According to Orbell, Thatcher’s government, which had
requested the Falconnet letters, never used them. “It was a
very, very doubled-edged sword,” he said in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
