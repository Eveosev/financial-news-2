Italy is preparing to sell new 30-
year bonds even as inconclusive elections pushed borrowing costs
up from near the lowest in two years. Spain also said it may
issue new debt.  Italy is in talks with investors and plans to lengthen the
maturity of its bonds as demand returns, debt agency head Maria Cannata said today at the Euromoney Bond Investors Congress in
London. The euro-area’s biggest bond market may also sell 10-
year inflation-linked securities this year, she said. The nation
faces fresh elections after inconclusive polls last week left
the biggest vote winner Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani without an effective legislative majority.  “The market is convinced a good solution will be found,
even if the situation is quite complex now,” Cannata said. The
bond market has reacted “quite well,” she said.  Thirty-year Italian yields dropped to 4.87 percent on Jan.
10, the lowest level since November 2010. The rate was 5.33
percent today, down from last year’s high of 7.07 percent.  Ten-year yields jumped to as high as 4.96 percent after the
Feb. 24-25 elections resulted in a hung parliament and handed
former premier Silvio Berlusconi a blocking minority in the
upper house. The rates reached as low as 4.07 percent on Jan.
25, the least since November 2010 and were at 4.66 percent
today.  ‘Difficult Market’  Italy sold 10 billion euros ($13 billion) more debt than it
needed to last year despite a “very difficult market
environment,” Cannata said. The debt agency remains committed
to issuing debt of all maturities, she said.  Spain is considering a sale of new 10-year bonds via banks
as soon as mid-year and of a new 15-year security, deputy debt
chief Ignacio Fernandez-Palomero Morales said.  The Spanish bond market has rallied since July and Morales
said it remains unscathed by the deadlock in Italy.  “We think that we would be able to go again for 10-year
issuance in this environment,” he told reporters. “We have to
remain flexible.”  Yields on Spanish 10-year bonds are about 15 basis points,
or 0.15 percentage point, lower than before the Italian
elections as investors bet the European Central Bank’s pledge to
buy the bonds of struggling nations will prevent contagion
spreading beyond Italy.  The additional yield investors demand to hold Spanish bonds
due in 2023 over their German counterparts has fallen to 356
basis points, from as much as 650 basis points on July 25. “We
have seen very aggressive spread tightening,” Morales said.  Spain is set to auction as much as 5 billion euros of debt
due between 2015 and 2023 at a sale tomorrow.  Ten-year Spanish yields declined four basis points to 5.01
percent today from 5.15 percent on Feb. 22.  France’s debt agency may sell a new 30-year benchmark, said
Maya Atig, deputy chief executive of Agence France Tresor, the
nation’s debt agency. The 30-year rate rose three basis points
to 3.18 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
