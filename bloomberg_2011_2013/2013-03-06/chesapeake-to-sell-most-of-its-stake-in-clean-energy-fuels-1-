(Corrects headline and first two paragraphs to show stock
sale is possible in story published on March 6.)  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) , the U.S.
natural gas producer selling as much as $7 billion in assets
this year to plug a cash shortfall, may sell part of its stake
in  Clean Energy (CLNE)  Fuels Corp.  Chesapeake’s interest in the Seal Beach, California,
builder of filling stations that dispense gas-derived transport
fuels would drop to 1.1 percent after a stock sale from the
current level of 7.7 percent, Clean Energy said in a U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission filing today.  Michael Kehs, a spokesman for Chesapeake, declined to
comment on whether the company plans to sell its Clean Energy
stake.  The announcement was made after the close of regular U.S.
trading. Clean Energy fell 4.1 percent to $12.50 at 5:37 p.m. in
New York. The stock lost 32 percent of its value in the past
year through today’s close.  Chesapeake, based on  Oklahoma City , first invested in Clean
Energy in 2011 to help support and expand the use of natural gas
in U.S. long-haul trucks. A cash crunch triggered by declining
gas prices prompted Chesapeake to auction about $11 billion in
oilfields, gas-processing plants and other properties last year,
and set a 2013 asset-sales target of $4 billion to $7 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
