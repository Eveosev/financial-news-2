President  Francois Hollande ’s
cabinet endorsed plans to revamp  France ’s job market as Le
Figaro newspaper labeled protests against the project a
“flop.”  The proposed law is based on a January agreement reached
between French business leaders and three unions giving
companies the right to reduce working time and salaries when
demand slows while also extending medical and unemployment
benefits and increasing taxes on short-term contracts.  “This agreement is a win-win for companies faced with
difficulties that need to re-organize,” Prime Minister Jean- Marc Ayrault told journalists after the cabinet meeting. “This
legislation will preserve jobs.”  Hollande is trying to speed the passage of the law through
parliament in an effort to stem a 21 month-long increase in
 jobless claims  and improve the competitiveness of an economy
that is teetering on the brink of recession.  To contact the reporters on this story:
