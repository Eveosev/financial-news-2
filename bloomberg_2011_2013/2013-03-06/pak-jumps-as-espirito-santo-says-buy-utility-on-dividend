ZE PAK SA (ZEP)  rose to a three-week high
after Espirito Santo Investment SA recommended buying shares of
 Poland ’s fourth-largest publicly traded power company, citing an
“attractive” valuation and dividend potential.  The  stock  climbed as much as 3.3 percent and traded 3
percent higher to 29 zloty as of 12:16 p.m. in Warsaw. Espirito
set its  price estimate  for the stock at 32.5 zloty in new
coverage today. Poland  sold  its entire 50 percent stake in the
utility’s initial public offering at 26.2 zloty a share last
year to help finance the  budget deficit .  “PAK is trading at a significant discount” to both
regional and European utilities, Maciej Hebda, head of equity
research at Espirito in Warsaw, said in a note. “We highlight
the company’s attractive dividend potential” and “relatively
low leverage.”  The utility, controlled by Polish billionaire Zygmunt Solorz-Zak, trades 6.6 times estimated 2013 earnings, or at a 28
percent discount to its central European competitors, according
to Espirito.  To contact the reporter on this story:
