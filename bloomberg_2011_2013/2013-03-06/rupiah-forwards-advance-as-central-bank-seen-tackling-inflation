Indonesia’s rupiah forwards rose for
a second day on speculation the central bank will take steps to
rein in inflation after it accelerated to a 20-month high in
February.  Government bonds  advanced.  DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and PT Mandiri Sekuritas said in
research notes they expect  Bank Indonesia  to raise its deposit
facility rate, or Fasbi, in 2013 after consumer prices gained
 5.31 percent  last month from a year earlier. That compares with
the monetary authority’s 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent target range.  “Pressure for Bank Indonesia to act is starting to rise,”
said Eugene Leow, an economist at DBS in Singapore. “Inflation
is already near the upper end of its target range, so once it
breaches the upper limit, we expect the central bank to move to
hike rates.”  The rupiah’s one-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.2
percent to 9,709 per dollar as of 9:02 a.m. in Jakarta, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. They traded at a 0.2 percent
discount to the spot rate, which rose 0.1 percent to 9,685 per
dollar, prices from local banks show. A daily  fixing  used to
settle rupiah derivatives was set at 9,709 yesterday by the
Association of Banks in Singapore.  Bank Indonesia will hold the benchmark  interest rate  at
5.75 percent tomorrow, according to all 15 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg.  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, which measures
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
increased two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.9
percent.  Auction Fails  The  finance ministry  failed to meet its target at an
Islamic bond auction for the second time in a row yesterday,
selling 760 billion rupiah ($78 million) of sukuk, short of its
1.5 trillion rupiah goal, spokesman Eri Hariyanto said.  The yield on the government’s 11 percent notes due October
2014 dropped one basis point to 4.3 percent, prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association show. The 10-year yield was
little changed at 5.36 percent.  The premium investors demand to hold the longer-dated
securities will probably widen to as much as 175 basis points as
investors prefer shorter tenors on concern inflation will
accelerate, DBS analysts led by  David Carbon  in Singapore, wrote
in a note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
