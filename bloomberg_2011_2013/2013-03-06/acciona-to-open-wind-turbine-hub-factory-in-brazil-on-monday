Acciona SA (ANA) , a Spanish renewable-
energy company, will open a turbine-hub assembly plant near
Brazil’s northeastern city of Salvador on March 11 as it seeks
to comply with the country’s local-content requirements for
wind-power equipment.  The facility will initially be able to produce 135 hubs for
 wind turbines  a year, Leslie Beatriz Crawford, a spokeswoman for
the Alcobendas, Spain-based company said today in an e-mail.
Acciona will source blades from a factory in Fortaleza, Brazil.  Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social,
Brazil’s development bank, stopped offering loans last year to
developers buying turbines from Acciona and four other turbine
makers that it said weren’t using enough domestically produced
components.  “We are confident we will be able to comply with BNDES
local-content rules,” Crawford said. “Acciona is committed to
the Brazilian market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
