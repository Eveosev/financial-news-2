Kurt Thomas would start at forward
for the  New York  Knicks tonight against the Detroit Pistons if
six-time All-Star Carmelo Anthony can’t play due to a knee
injury.  Thomas, 40, would open the game and Amar’e Stoudemire would
come off the bench, Knicks coach Mike Woodson told reporters
following the National Basketball Association team’s shoot-
around today in Detroit.  Anthony didn’t practice with the team as he recovers from a
right knee injury and is questionable for tonight’s game.  “I want to go with Kurt,” Woodson said. “We’re only
talking three or four minutes and then Amar’e will be in the
game.”  Anthony tripped in the second quarter of the Knicks’
victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers two days ago. He didn’t
return to the game and was given the day off yesterday.  Anthony is averaging 28.2 points per game this season,
second in the NBA behind Kevin Durant of the Oklahoma City
Thunder.  The Knicks (36-21) are in first place in the Eastern
Conference Atlantic Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
