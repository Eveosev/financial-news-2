Colombian President  Juan Manuel
Santos  said a peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
 Colombia , or FARC, would  be the best monument to honor the
memory of  Venezuela ’s President Hugo Chavez.  Santos comments on Chavez:
“Everyone knows that we had a lot of differences in our
economic vision, in our governing style, in our understanding of
social progress. But from the first days of my presidency we
decided to put aside these differences to concentrate on the
greater good of Venezuela and of Colombia.”  “The obsession that united us, which was the foundation of our
relationship, was peace in Colombia and the region. If we have
advanced in a solid peace process, with clear and concrete
progress, advances that have never been achieved before with the
guerrillas of the FARC, it is also thanks to the unlimited
dedication of President Chavez and of the Venezuelan
government.”  “The best tribute we can give to memory of  Hugo Chavez  is to
realize this dream that he shared with us to reach an agreement
to end the conflict and see a Colombia in peace.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
