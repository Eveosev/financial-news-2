Beijing Automotive Group Co., which
makes vehicles with Daimler AG and Hyundai Motor Co., will seek
to sell shares in its car unit in  China  after completing a  Hong
Kong  initial public offering.  The Hong Kong IPO will take place by the end of this year
“if it moves fast,” Beijing Auto Chairman Xu Heyi said in an
interview at the National People’s Congress in Beijing
yesterday. “We will come back for an A-share listing after
that.”  BAIC, as the company is known, traces its roots to making
sidecar motorcycles used in the  Korean War  and has said it plans
to make “world-class” cars by 2025 and hired Ferrari designer
Leonardo Fiorvanati to help improve its brand appeal. The
fundraising will help the automaker’s aim of expanding vehicle
sales more than 70 percent by 2015.  The company, based in Beijing, hired Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Morgan Stanley for the Hong Kong IPO of its car unit
and may seek more than $1 billion in the share sale, three
people with knowledge of the matter said in January. That would
be the biggest by an automaker since  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s $18.1
billion offering in 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The timing for the car unit’s yuan-denominated A-share
listing will depend on market conditions, which are hard to
predict, Xu said.  BAIC is targeting to sell 3.6 million vehicles by 2015,
from a projected 2.1 million units this year, according to Xu.
The automaker wants to boost the proportion of medium to high-
end car sales, which are more profitable, to 50 percent of total
deliveries from the current 36 percent, he said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
