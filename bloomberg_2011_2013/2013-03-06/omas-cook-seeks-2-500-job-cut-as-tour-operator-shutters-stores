Thomas Cook Group Plc (TCG) , the U.K. tour
operator, said it plans to cut 2,500 jobs, or 16 percent of the
total, in a drive to close stores in towns where it has more
than one outlet and eliminate those that are underperforming.  A 90-day consultation period with unions began today as the
London-based company, which has a U.K. workforce of 15,500
people, seeks to shutter 195 of its 1,069 sales outlets.  Thomas Cook is midway through a three-year turnaround
program and restructuring costs and savings linked to the
changes announced today were included in financial guidance
previously provided, it said in a statement.  “It is essential that we operate with the right number of
people,” said Peter Fankhauser, head of  Thomas Cook ’s operations
in the U.K. and continental  Europe , adding that the company
“needs to make the proposed changes to secure our future and
provide continued employment.”  Thomas Cook rose as much as 2.9 percent and was trading 1.2
percent higher as of 12:34 p.m. in London, valuing the company
at 787 million pounds ($1.2 billion).  The stock has surged 80 percent this year after tripling in
price in 2012. That’s after a 92 percent decline in 2011, when
the 170-year-old company was saved by an emergency loan as
borrowings rose after bookings were hurt by a squeeze on
 consumer spending  in the U.K. and unrest in North Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
