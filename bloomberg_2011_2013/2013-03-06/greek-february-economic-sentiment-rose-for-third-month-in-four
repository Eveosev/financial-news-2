Greek economic sentiment improved in
February for a third time in four months as the country
continued to receive funding under bailouts from the European
Union and the International Monetary Fund.  An index measuring short-term economic trends stood at
86.9, up from 85.8 in January, the Foundation for Economic &
Industrial Research, known as IOBE, said in an e-mailed report
today.  Consumer confidence  rose to minus 71.4 from minus 71.9,
the Athens-based foundation said.  Greece’s parliament in November approved tax increases and
spending cuts demanded by creditors for the release of loans
required to keep the country solvent. The loans had been frozen
since June, when political instability caused by two elections
in six weeks contributed to the country missing targets set
under the bailout.  “The stabilization of the picture confirms that people and
companies are trying to adjust to the conditions the
implementation of additional measures are creating,” IOBE said.
“Consumer confidence remains low, however, with people having a
pessimistic outlook on their personal finances and on the
economy as a whole.”  Gross domestic product has shrunk by a fifth since  Greece 
entered its recession in 2008, while more than a quarter of the
workforce is unemployed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
