Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) ’s
Zimbabwean unit must cede 51 percent ownership to the country
without compensation, Zimbabwe Indigenization Minister Saviour
Kasukuwere said.  Zimbabwean President  Robert Mugabe  said March 1 that the
country shouldn’t pay for the stake in  Zimplats Holdings Ltd. (ZIM) 
because all natural resources belong to the state.  “They know what the president said and they have to do
that,” Kasukuwere said today by telephone from Harare, the
capital.  Impala, which owned 87 percent of Zimplats and is the
world’s biggest producer of the metal after Anglo American
Platinum Ltd., signed terms to sell 51 percent of the unit to
the country’s black citizens in January. Any previous agreement
between Zimplats and Zimbabwe’s National Indigenization and
Economic Empowerment Board must now “take into account”
Mugabe’s statement, Kasukuwere said.  Calls to Zimplats Chief Executive Officer Alex Mhembere in
Harare weren’t answered.  Zimbabwe  seized 27,498 hectares (67,949 acres) of
Zimplats’s land March 1, saying the company had 30 days to
appeal a decree contained in the Government Gazette.  NI AFRICA
