German power for next-day delivery
declined the most this week as forecasts showed that wind
generation in  Europe ’s biggest electricity market may more than
triple tomorrow.  German day-ahead baseload power , for delivery around the
clock, fell 15 percent in the daily auction on the EPEX Spot
power exchange. Power generation from the nation’s wind turbines
will peak at 10,160 megawatts tomorrow at 11:30 p.m. Berlin
time, according to Bloomberg’s wind power model for  Germany .
Today’s maximum will be 3,349 megawatts at 11:30 p.m., the model
shows at its last update at 4:15 p.m. Berlin time.  The next-day contract slid 7.54 euros to 41.46 euros
($53.89) a megawatt-hour, according to EPEX Spot.  In Germany, available output from  power plants  will rise
tomorrow to 62,018 megawatts from 61,867 megawatts today,
according to data from the European Energy Exchange AG’s
transparency  website . In  France , generation capacity will drop
to 88,410 megawatts tomorrow from 90,898 megawatts yesterday,
according to the  website  of Reseau de Transport d’Electricite.  German baseload power for 2014, a European benchmark,
slipped 10 cents to 41.35 euros a megawatt-hour, according to
broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
