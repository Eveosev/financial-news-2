Ace Ltd., the insurer with
operations in more than 50 nations, said Robert Cusumano is
departing as the insurer’s general counsel to “pursue other
interests.”  Cusumano has been in the role for eight years and will
remain in the position until a successor is appointed, the
Zurich-based company said today in a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
