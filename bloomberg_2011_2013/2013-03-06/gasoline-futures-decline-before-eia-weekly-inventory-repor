Gasoline futures slipped before the
Energy Information Administration reports on last week’s U.S.
oil inventories. Crack spreads gained.  Prices sank as much as 0.5 percent before the report’s
10:30 a.m. release in  Washington . The EIA will probably report
that gasoline stockpiles fell 1 million barrels, according to
the median estimate of 12 analysts in a survey by Bloomberg. The
industry-funded American Petroleum Institute reported yesterday
a drop of 914,000 barrels.  “We saw inventories drop in the API report and now we’re
going to look for confirmation of these changes,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  April-delivery gasoline fell 1.14 cents to $3.1368 a gallon
on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange on volume that was 38
percent above the 100-day average at 9:55 a.m.  The April contract’s premium over West Texas Intermediate
crude on Nymex widened 14 cents to $41.54 a barrel, and gained
19 cents to $20.80 over Brent oil on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  The survey projected that the EIA will report that supplies
of distillates, including diesel and heating oil, declined 1
million barrels last week. The API reported a drop of 1.69
million barrels.  Heating oil for March delivery declined 0.16 cent to
$2.9714 a gallon on volume that was 34 percent above the 100-day
average for the time of day.  Gasoline at the pump , averaged nationwide, fell 1 cent to
$3.727 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. It was the
seventh consecutive drop. Prices, which have risen 13 percent
this year, are 3.7 cents below a year earlier. Prices in 2012
peaked on April 4 at $3.936 after rising every day but one from
March 9.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
