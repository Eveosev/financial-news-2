Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  became the
first Asian company to top the list of patent applicants at the
European Patent Office.  Samsung filed 2,251 requests for patent protection last
year, followed by 2,193 from  Siemens AG (SIE)  and 1,713 applications
by  BASF SE (BAS) , the Munich-based patent office said in statement
today. The EPO is the only place in Europe where companies can
apply for region-wide patent protection. The office isn’t part
of the EU and has 38 member states.  “The patent filings of today are shaping the innovations
of tomorrow,” Benoit Battistelli, the EPO’s president, said in
the statement. “In 2012, the steepest growth in patent filings
and more than half of the increase came from Asian firms.”  Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung is engaged in a global
patent fight with  Apple (AAPL)  Inc. over tablet computers and
smartphones. The companies are using litigation as part of a
strategy to seek dominance of a mobile-device market estimated
by researcher Yankee Group at $346 billion in 2012, even as
Apple remains one of Samsung’s biggest customers.  Overall, the EPO received 5.2 percent more patent
applications in 2012 than in 2011, amounting to 257,744 filings
last year in total.  To contact the reporter on this story:
