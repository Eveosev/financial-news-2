EE, the wireless operator owned by
 Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  and  France Telecom SA (FTE) , lost a bid to
overturn the U.K. telecommunication regulator’s decision to
limit what mobile companies can charge to connect to other
networks.  EE challenged Ofcom’s 2011 reduction of so-called
termination rates by more than half, a move that is expected to
cost operators about 200 million pounds ($302 million) a year,
appeals court judge Alan Moses said in a written ruling today.
He agreed with an earlier decision by the Competition Appeal
Tribunal and rejected EE’s claim.  BT Group Plc (BT/A) ,  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) ’s U.K unit and
 Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  have all appealed aspects of Ofcom’s changes,
which must be implemented by 2014.  David Nieberg, a spokesman for EE, said the company was
disappointed with the ruling. Ofcom spokesman Joe Smithies
declined to comment.  Deutsche Telecom said in February an initial public
offering of EE shares would take place later this year,
depending on market conditions. The U.K.’s largest wireless
carrier has attracted interest from private equity firms and may
be worth about 7 billion pounds, according to Raymond James Euro
Equities analysts.  The case is British Telecommunications PLC & Ors -v- Office
of Communications, Appeal of 2nd Appellant from the order of The
Competition Appeal Tribunal, dated 8th May 2012, filed 20th June
2012. C3/2012/1523  To contact the reporter on this story:
