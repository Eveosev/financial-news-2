Natural gas futures in  New York 
declined the most in three weeks on forecasts for moderating
weather that would limit demand for the heating fuel after a
winter storm passes through the Northeast.  Gas slid 1.7 percent, the biggest drop since Feb. 14, after
Andover, Massachusetts-based WSI Corp. predicted mostly average
temperatures in the lower-48 states from March 11 through March
15. The low in New York on March 12 may be 36 degrees Fahrenheit
(2 Celsius), 2 above normal, according to  AccuWeather Inc.   “We’re seeing a change in the forecast and that’s where
the pressure is coming from,” said Bob Yawger, director of the
futures division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York.
“We’re generally not seeing temperatures in the 20s here in the
10-day forecast.”  Natural gas for April delivery fell 5.9 cents to $3.47 per
million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Trading volume was 22 percent below the 100-day
average at 2:48 p.m. Prices settled at $3.529 per million Btu on
March 4, the highest close since Jan. 23, and were unchanged
yesterday. The futures have gained 3.6 percent this year.  April $3.25 puts were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They were 0.5 cent higher at 2 cents per
million Btu on volume of 848 contracts as of 3:53 p.m. Puts
accounted for 53 percent of options volume.  May gas traded 4.9 cents above the April contract, compared
with 4.6 cents yesterday.  Chicago Weather  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
data from the Energy Information Administration show. The agency
is part of the Energy Department.  The low in  Chicago  on March 12 may be 31 degrees Fahrenheit
1 higher than average, according to AccuWeather.  Rain mixed with snow cut accumulations in  Washington ,
according to the  National Weather Service . One to two more
inches of snow may fall before the storm ends, the agency said.
About 0.6 inch fell at  College Park ,  Maryland , north of the
capital. The weather service had predicted as much as 8 to 12
inches in Washington and Baltimore.  Farther to the west, about 196,000 utility customers were
without power at 3:30 p.m. local time, with power failures
concentrated in  West Virginia  and  Virginia , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Last year was the warmest in records going back to 1895 for
the 48 contiguous U.S. states and the second-worst for weather
extremes including drought, hurricanes and wildfires, according
to the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .  U.S. Stockpiles  Gas inventories  fell by 132 billion cubic feet in the seven
days ended March 1, above the five-year average drop of 107
billion for the week, according to the median of 16 analyst
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Last year, supplies slid by 92
billion during that period.  Stockpiles totaled 2.229 trillion cubic feet as of Feb. 22,
16 percent above the five-year average and 12 percent below the
year-earlier level.  Marketed gas production will average a record 70.02 billion
cubic feet a day this year, up 1.1 percent from 2012, as output
from the Marcellus shale formation in the Northeast grows, the
EIA said in its monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook , released Feb.
12 in Washington.  Gas prices  at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana ,
will average $3.53 per million British thermal units in 2013,
compared with $2.75 per million Btu last year, the agency said.  Stockpiles of the fuel may total about 2 trillion cubic
feet at the end of March, down from 2.477 trillion at the same
time last year, according to the report.  Output rose to an all-time high of 28.5 trillion cubic feet
in 2011, led by record production from shale deposits, the EIA
said in a separate report Jan. 7. Shale accounted for 30 percent
of output in 2011, up from 22 percent the previous year.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped America
meet 84 percent of its energy needs in the first 11 months of
last year, government data show. If the trend continued through
2012, it will be the highest level of self-sufficiency since
1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
