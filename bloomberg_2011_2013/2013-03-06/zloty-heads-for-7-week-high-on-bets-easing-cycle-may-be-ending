The zloty headed for its highest
level in almost seven weeks on speculation the Polish central
bank may signal an end to its easing cycle at a policy meeting
today.  The zloty gained for a second day, strengthening by less
than 0.1 percent to 4.1278 against the euro at 9:29 a.m. in
Warsaw, its highest level on a closing basis since Jan. 17.  Polish rate-setters will cut rates by 25 basis points for
the fifth time in as many months, according to 22 out of 38
economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg. A reduction to 3.5 percent
will take rates to the lowest level since December 2000.  “The cut by 25 basis points that we expect should weaken
the zloty slightly,” Raiffeisen Bank Polska SA economists led
by Marta Petka-Zagajewska wrote in a note. “But it may be
accompanied by a statement suggesting an end to cuts, which
would on the other hand support the zloty. We may see increased
volatility on EURPLN and fluctuations between 4.10 and 4.15.”  Yields on two-year  government bonds  rose 1 basis point, or
0.1 percentage point, to 3.57 percent. The rate on 10-year debt
fell 1 basis point to 4.04 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
