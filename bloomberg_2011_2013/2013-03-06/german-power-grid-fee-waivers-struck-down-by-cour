A German regulation exempting power
intensive industries from paying grid fees was struck down by a
national court today shortly after European Union regulators
said they are probing whether the waiver constitutes illegal
subsidies.  Germany ’s Federal Network Agency, which had issued the
waiver in 2011, lacks authority for such a step under current
law, Wiegand Laubenstein, presiding judge at the Dusseldorf
Higher Regional Court, said after delivering ruling today. The
decision can be appealed.  Germany’s current energy law “authorizes only to regulate
the method to calculate the fee but not a full waiver of these
fees,” the court said in a  statement . “A complete waiver
violates the principle of equal treatment” and European laws.  Companies using large amounts of energy could apply for a
waiver under the rules struck down today. Their share of the
fees had to be covered by other power users, and some of those
sued against the levy. Today’s case was brought by five regional
power utilities. It’s one of about 100 suits pending over the
issue.  The European Commission said today it would investigate the
fee waiver for large electricity customers, valued at 300
million euros ($391 million) last year, following complaints
from consumer groups, energy companies and others.  To contact the reporters on this story:
