General Motors Co. (GM)  is working on
developing an electric car that has a range of as much as 200
miles (322 kilometers), Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson
said.  “There will be breakthroughs in battery technology,
they’re on the horizon,” Akerson said today during a
presentation at the IHS CERAWeek energy conference broadcast on
CNBC.com. “We’re actually developing a car today which is
really anathema to the way the  auto industry  works: We’re
running a dual play on the technology to see which one will
succeed. One will result in” a 100-mile range, “the other will
be a 200-mile range.”  The CEO reiterated GM’s plans to have about 500,000
vehicles on the road by 2017 with some form of electrification,
including the Chevrolet Volt, which can go 38 miles on battery
power, and he also pointed to work the Detroit-based automaker
is doing with diesel and compressed-natural gas, according
prepared remarks.  During his speech, Akerson called on President  Barack Obama 
to appoint a commission to develop a 30-year  energy policy  and
said the U.S. should continue to develop all forms of energy,
including renewable sources.  “Everywhere you look there are opportunities to seize the
energy high ground,” Akerson said in the text of his prepared
speech. “Indeed, our leaders have been presented with an
historic opportunity to create a national energy policy from a
position of strength and abundance. The pillars of such a plan
must include energy diversity, so we do not become dependent on
any one fuel or energy source.”  Cutting Weight  Automakers that reduce curb weight of their vehicles by 10
percent should be able to reduce fuel consumption by 6.5
percent, Akerson said.  “Our target is to reduce weight by up to 15 percent.”  GM is bringing out an all-electric version of the Chevrolet
Spark subcompact and a diesel version of the compact Chevrolet
Cruze this year as two of about 20 new vehicles the company is
introducing in the U.S. Akerson is looking to boost market share
in the country after it fell to an 88-year-low in 2012.  The Spark will have an electric range of 75 miles to 80
miles, he said.  The automaker’s U.S. sales of cars and light trucks rose
3.7 percent last year, less than the industrywide gain of 13
percent. As a result, GM’s share of the U.S. market slid to 17.9
percent, the lowest since 1924.  As GM lost share,  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  gained with U.S. sales
of its three brands increasing 27 percent last year to 2.08
million, helped by the introduction of 19 new or refreshed
vehicles.  The sales surged helped Toyota outsell GM last year by
460,000 vehicles globally to again become the best-selling
automaker in the world. The U.S. automaker finished No. 2,
outselling  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  by more than 200,000 deliveries. The
Wolfsburg, Germany-based automaker aims to become the world’s
biggest by 2018.  To contact the reporter on this story:
