The U.K.’s top prosecutor said  law
enforcement  must change the way it investigates and prosecutes
sex crimes after TV star Jimmy Savile’s decades of abuse against
hundreds of victims went undetected until after his death.  The changes include a panel to re-investigate historic
allegations of misconduct that police chose not to pursue, the
 Crown Prosecution Service  said  in a statement .  “We cannot afford another Savile moment in five or 10
years’ time,” said  Keir Starmer , Director of Public
Prosecutions.  Savile, a former BBC television presenter, committed more
than 200 offenses in schools and hospitals, according to an
investigation begun after his death. Police and prosecutors
could have filed criminal charges against him if the cases had
been handled properly, the CPS said in a January report.  The CPS said it would introduce a single approach to
investigating sexual abuse, and give extra training to police
and prosecutors to ensure better standards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
