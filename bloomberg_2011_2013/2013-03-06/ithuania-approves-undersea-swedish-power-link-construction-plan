Lithuania’s government approved a
plan to lay 450 kilometers (280 miles) of cable under the  Baltic
Sea  to allow the region’s first power link with Sweden to start
operating by the end of 2015.  The 700-megawatt capacity NordBalt link will be the world’s
third-longest undersea power cable, with switching stations in
Klaipeda, Lithuania, and Nybro, Sweden, the government in
Vilnius said today in an e-mailed statement.  The European Union, which includes the NordBalt link on its
list of strategic projects for connecting the 27-member bloc’s
energy markets, will help finance the 550 million-euro ($716
million) project. The EU aims to eliminate the isolation of all
states’ power and natural gas networks by 2015 in order to gain
authority over the region’s energy policy.  “This link will ensure  Lithuania ’s ability to trade
electricity with the the Nordic region,” the government said.  Horizontal drilling from the Curonian Spit at the seaport
of Klaipeda into the Baltic Sea is planned to start in the
autumn, and cable, which is now being made by  ABB Ltd. (ABBN) , will be
installed starting in April 2014, according to the statement.  The project has been developed in consultation with the
Curonian Spit National Park, which is a UNESCO World Heritage
site, and with other social stakeholders,  Litgrid AB (LGD1L) ,
Lithuania’s power-grid operator, said in a separate statement.  The EU is also supporting the construction of the 500-
megawatt LitPol Link connection between Lithuania and
neighboring  Poland ’s power system by the end of 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
