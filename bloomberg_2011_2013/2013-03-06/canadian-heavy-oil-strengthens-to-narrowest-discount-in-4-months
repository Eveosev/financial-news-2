Canadian heavy  oil prices 
strengthened on the  spot market  to their narrowest discount in
four months as production from a major oil sands producer came
in below expectations.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  oil-sands production increased 2 percent
to 353,000 barrels a day in February from a month earlier, the
Calgary company said in a statement yesterday. First quarter
output has been 3 percent below expectations so far, with late
latest results “slightly negative” for the company, RBC
Capital Markets analyst Greg Pardy wrote in a note to clients.  Western  Canada  Select, a heavy blend of oil-sands bitumen,
for April delivery gained $1.75 to a $23 discount to West Texas
Intermediate, according to Calgary oil broker Net Energy Inc.
It’s the narrowest discount since Oct. 24, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Rising production and limited pipeline space has put
pressure on the price of Canadian oil over the last several
months, with Western Canada Select reaching a record discount of
$42.50 a barrel on Dec. 14. Less output from projects this
winter has eased the pipeline constraints.  Production from Syncrude, the largest oil sands project in
 Alberta , declined 13.5 percent to 240,000 barrels a day in
February, reflecting unreliability in mining operations and
unplanned shutdowns at the upgrader, according to a March 1 news
release by  Canadian Oil Sands Ltd. (COS) , the project’s largest owner.  Kearl Project  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) ’s Kearl oil-sands project also didn’t
come online as expected in January, which the company said was
caused by abnormally cold weather in Alberta. The company said
Feb. 1 that the project will ramp up to full rates of 110,000
barrels a day in the “next several months.”  Output from Suncor Energy Inc.’s 350,000-barrel-a-day
 upgrader  in Fort McMurray, Alberta, will be reduced with the
start of 14 weeks of work on a hydrogen plant late in the first
quarter, the company said in its fourth-quarter earnings release
Feb. 5.  Lower production freed up space on export pipelines out of
Alberta.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  export pipelines to the Midwest from
Canada were not apportioned in March, the company said in a Feb.
21 e-mail. Export lines 4 and 67 carrying a combined 1.25
million barrels a day were apportioned for five months through
February, meaning there wasn’t enough space to meet all requests
to transport oil.  Syncrude Sweet prices declined for the first time in four
days, losing 55 cents to trade at a $5.95 premium, according to
Net Energy Inc. data. The grade on March 4 reached its highest
level since Oct. 4, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In the Gulf Coast market, Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium
to WTI strengthened by 25 cents to $22.10 a barrel at 4:16 p.m.
 New York  time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet’s premium rose 30 cents to $22.80.  Mars Blend’s premium widened 10 cents to $17.80 a barrel
over WTI, and Poseidon gained 30 cents to a $17.95 premium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
