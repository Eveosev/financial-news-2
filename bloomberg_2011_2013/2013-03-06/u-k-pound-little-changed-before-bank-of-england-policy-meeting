The pound fell for the first time in
three days against the dollar as Bank of England policy makers
started a two-day meeting to decide whether to add more stimulus
to revive the struggling economy.  The U.K. currency weakened all except two of its 16 major
counterparts as 11 of the 39 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News predict the central bank will tomorrow increase its asset-
purchase target to at least 400 billion pounds ($603 billion)
from the current 375 billion pounds. The remainder forecast so-
called quantitative easing will be kept on hold. U.K. government
bonds were little changed.  “The risk, if there is a surprise at all, is that there
will be more asset purchases and that will weigh on sterling,”
said Raghav Subbarao, a foreign-exchange strategist at Barclays
Plc in  London . “Our base case is that there won’t be any change
in policy tomorrow.”  The pound dropped 0.5 percent to $1.5053 at 4:25 p.m.
London time after falling to $1.4986 on March 1, the weakest
level since July 2010. The U.K. currency declined 0.1 percent to
86.37 pence per euro.  Sterling has slumped 5.6 percent this year, the worst
performer among the 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar gained 2.6
percent and the euro rose 1.2 percent.  ‘Stand Ready’  U.K. policy makers said they “stand ready” to increase
quantitative easing to support the recovery, according to the
minutes of last month’s monetary policy decision published on
Feb. 20. In a wide-ranging discussion on the need for
“targeted” measures, they said some may be beyond the scope of
the central bank and fall under the province of other government
departments.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt traded at 1.96
percent. The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 was at
98.215.  U.K. house prices rose in February, according to Halifax,
which said the market is improving and values may continue to
increase. Prices climbed 0.5 percent from the previous month,
the mortgage unit of Lloyds Banking Group Plc said in a
statement in London.  While both Nationwide Building Society and Hometrack Ltd.
also reported increases in house prices in February, Nationwide
said the property recovery is “likely to be gradual.”  U.K. government bonds have lost 1 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bunds dropped 0.5 percent and Treasuries fell 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
