The costs of diabetes, including
medical care and lost productivity, jumped 21 percent to $245
billion last year from 2007, driven by higher rates of the
disease and health conditions that lead to it, researchers said.  The report, released today by the  American Diabetes
Association , showed that costs for the disease, which afflicts 7
percent of the population, are escalating. In 2007, the
association reported that the expenses had increased about 14
percent since 2002, after inflation.  “Increased prevalence, not increased cost per patient, is
the driving force behind the increased economic burden of
diabetes,” said Robert Ratner, chief scientific and medical
officer for the association, at a press conference at the U.S.
Capitol today. The study will be published in the journal
Diabetes Care in April.  The diabetes association’s study draws on data including
the  U.S. Census  and claims filed in the Medicare program for the
elderly and disabled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
