Colombia’s peso bonds rose for a
fifth day, pushing yields to a record low, as the slowest
inflation since 1955 encouraged speculation that the central
bank will lower borrowing costs further.  Yields on peso bonds maturing in 2024 decreased two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.94 percent at 8:49 a.m.
in Bogota, according to the central bank. That is the lowest
level since the securities were issued in 2009. The price rose
0.210 centavo to 143.188 centavos per peso.  Colombia has entered a “sustainable low inflation phase,”
which means policy makers can concentrate on spurring economic
growth to its potential annual rate of 4.8 percent, Finance
Minister Mauricio Cardenas said yesterday in a phone interview.
The central bank has cut its policy rate six times beginning in
July to 3.75 percent, the lowest level among major Latin
American economies. The next rate-setting meeting is scheduled
for March 22.  Consumer prices rose 1.83 percent in February from a year
earlier, the government reported yesterday. That is the slowest
annual pace since 1955, when General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla ruled
as dictator. The median forecast of 23 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for an inflation rate of 1.89 percent.  The peso appreciated 0.1 percent to 1,808.40 per U.S.
dollar, paring its drop this year to 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
