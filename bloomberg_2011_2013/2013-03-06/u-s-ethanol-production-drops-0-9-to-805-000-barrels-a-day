Ethanol production in the U.S. fell
0.9 percent to 805,000 barrels a day last week, an Energy
Information Administration report showed.  Output in the period ended March 1 snapped a four-week
streak of gains and slid to the lowest level since Feb. 15,
according to today’s report from the Energy Department’s
statistical arm.  Inventories fell for a fifth week to 19.4 million barrels,
the lowest level since Nov. 30. It was the longest set of
declines since October 2010.  The U.S. didn’t  import  any of the biofuel, for the first
time since Feb. 1, down from 32,000 barrels a day the previous
week, the report showed.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 94 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool, up from 88 percent in the week ended Feb. 22
and the highest level since Oct. 5, EIA said.  Denatured ethanol for April delivery rose 0.4 cent to
$2.436 a gallon at 10:16 a.m. local time on the Chicago Board of
Trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
