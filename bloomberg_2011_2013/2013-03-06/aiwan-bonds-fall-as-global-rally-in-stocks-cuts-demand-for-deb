Taiwan ’s government bonds fell,
pushing the 10-year yield to the highest level this week, on
optimism a recovery in the U.S. will boost demand for the
island’s exports.  Asian stocks rose after the Dow Jones Industrial Average
climbed to a record, driving a second day of gains in the Taiwan
dollar. The U.S. Institute for Supply Management reported its
non-manufacturing index increased to 56 last month, the highest
level since February 2012. The U.S. is Taiwan’s second-biggest
export market after  China .  “Yields started out pretty high because of the U.S. stock
rally,” said Baker Tu, a fixed-income trader at  Capital
Securities Corp. (6005)  in Taipei. “The bond-buying programs should
ultimately improve the U.S. economy and may help push yields in
Taiwan higher.”  The rate on the 1.125 percent notes due March 2023 was
1.211 percent as of 4:11 p.m. in Taipei, compared with 1.207
percent yesterday, according to prices from Gretai Securities
Market. That was the highest level since March 1.  Taiwan’s Taiex index of shares rose for a second day and
was 1 percent off a 10-month high reached on Feb. 20. Global
funds bought $128 million more of the island’s stocks than they
sold yesterday, boosting net purchases this year to $1.9 billion,
according to exchange data.  Currency Market  The Taiwan dollar strengthened 0.2 percent to NT$29.67
against its U.S. counterpart, based on prices from Taipei Forex
Inc. It touched NT$29.77 yesterday and the day before, the
weakest level since September. One-month  non-deliverable
forwards  climbed 0.2 percent to NT$29.608, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank has sold the local currency near the close
on most days in the past 11 months, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  One-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a
measure of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price
options, dropped 53 basis points, or 0.53 percentage point, to
4.08 percent. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at
0.388 percent, according to the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
