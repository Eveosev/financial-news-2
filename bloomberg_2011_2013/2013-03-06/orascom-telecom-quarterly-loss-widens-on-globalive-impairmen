Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE)  said its
fourth-quarter loss widened after the Cairo-based mobile phone
company recorded an impairment charge against a loan to its
Canadian unit.  Orascom Telecom’s net loss attributable to equity holders
widened to $474 million from $125 million in the year-earlier
period, according to a  statement  on its website. Shareholders of
the company agreed in November to forgive outstanding interest
on a loan to Globalive Investment Holding Corp. The quarterly
results included a $339 million impairment related to that debt.  The operator, which merged with  Russia ’s  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  in
2011, posted a 1.4 percent advance in fourth-quarter revenue to
$908 million, including $466 million from Algerian unit Djezzy,
according to the statement. Djezzy, the subject of an ownership
dispute between the company and Algeria’s government for almost
three years, “continued to face various challenges due to
actions from a number of government authorities,” Orascom said.  Local Algerian lenders were asked “not to process any
overseas foreign currency transfers” for Djezzy, according to
Orascom Telecom.  Shares of the phone company  fell 1 percent to 4.09 Egyptian
pounds at the close in Cairo today, trimming this year’s gain to
3 percent. That compares with a 3.7 percent decline for the
benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  so far in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
