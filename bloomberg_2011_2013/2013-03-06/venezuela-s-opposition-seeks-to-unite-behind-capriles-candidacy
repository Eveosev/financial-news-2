Venezuela’s opposition alliance will
likely select Henrique Capriles Radonski as its presidential
candidate to run in snap election following the death of  Hugo
Chavez , a party official said.  A final decision will only be taken following Chavez’s
March 8 funeral, Ramon Jose Medina, the deputy head of the
Democratic Unity Table, said following a day of meetings with
other opposition members.  Capriles, who lost to Chavez by 11 percentage points last
October, would face off against Chavez’s preferred successor,
Vice President  Nicolas Maduro , in elections scheduled to take
place in 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
