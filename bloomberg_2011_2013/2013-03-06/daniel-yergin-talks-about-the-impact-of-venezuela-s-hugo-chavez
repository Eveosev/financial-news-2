Daniel Yergin , vice chairman of IHS
and author of “The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money &
Power,” said high  oil prices  made Chavez’s presidency possible.  “It’s too soon to say what  Hugo Chavez ’s death means for oil
prices, but it is certainly true that oil prices are what made
Hugo Chavez possible.  ‘‘The collapse of oil prices in 1997-8 and the resulting
discontent in Venezuela gave him the opening to become
president, just seven years after he was sent to jail for
leading a coup. And it was rising oil prices since 2000 that
gave him the financial resources to consolidate power, court
public opinion and try to turn his Bolivarian revolution into a
global campaign for ‘twenty-first century socialism.’  ‘‘He leaves behind an economy greatly weakened by spending,
intervention, inflation capital flight, and shortages. And,
beyond Cuba, his effort to create an alliance against what he
called ‘‘the U.S. empire’’ managed only to enlist a few
countries.  ‘‘Without his charisma and force of character, it is not all
clear how his successors will maintain the system he created.’’  To contact the reporters on this story:
