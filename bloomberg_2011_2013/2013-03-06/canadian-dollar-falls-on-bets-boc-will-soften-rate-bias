The Canadian dollar traded at almost
its lowest level in eight months against its U.S. counterpart
amid speculation the Bank of Canada may drop its bias toward
raising interest rates at today’s policy meeting.  The currency pared losses as global stocks gained on
increased risk appetite. The central bank is forecast to hold
its target rate at 1 percent, according to all 22 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Governor  Mark Carney  reiterated on Feb.
25 that rate increases are less urgent amid signs of slowing
growth.  “The Bank of Canada is going to be somewhat cautious in
its assessment of the end of 2012 and maybe revising down some
of its outlook for 2013,” said  David Tulk , chief macro
strategist at  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ’s TD Securities unit, by
phone from Toronto. “We think the bank still does want to send
the message to the market that the overnight rate will move
higher, but maybe not for some time.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, was little changed at
C$1.0270 per  U.S. dollar  at 8:55 a.m. in Toronto. One loonie
buys 97.37 U.S. cents. The loonie touched C$1.0342 per U.S.
dollar March 1, the lowest level since June 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
