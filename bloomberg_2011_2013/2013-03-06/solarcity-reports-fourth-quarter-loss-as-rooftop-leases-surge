SolarCity Corp. (SCTY) , the solar-power
provider led by billionaire Elon Musk, posted a fourth-quarter
loss as a surge in demand for solar leases increased its
investment in rooftop power systems.  The loss was $3.04 million, or $1.10 cents a share,
compared with net income of $14.1 million, or 24 cents a year
earlier, San Mateo, California-based SolarCity said today in a
statement. The company was expected to lose 49 cents a share,
the average of five analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales rose to $25.3 million from $20.7 million a year
earlier. This was the company’s first earnings report since its
December initial public offering.  The company invested $151.3 million to build solar systems
in the quarter, outpacing revenue, as demand for rooftop panels
from homeowners and businesses surged. Installations increased
129 percent to 48 megawatts from a year earlier.  SolarCity shares have more than doubled since they debuted
at $8 on Dec. 12. They gained 3.9 percent to $19.27 at the close
in New York.  SolarCity in January said installations of rooftop solar
systems will climb to 250 megawatts this year, up from 156
megawatts in 2012. The company installs and maintains solar
power systems that provide electricity to homeowners in 14
states.  (SolarCity scheduled a conference call with analysts and
investors at 5 p.m. in New York. To listen, go to the company’s
