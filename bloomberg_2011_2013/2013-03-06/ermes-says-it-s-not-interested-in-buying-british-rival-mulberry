Hermes International SCA (RMS) , the French
maker of Birkin bags, denied it’s interested in Mulberry Group
Plc after The Daily Mail reported it may bid for the British
bagmaker.  “We deny completely” speculation that Paris-based Hermes
is preparing an offer, Deputy Managing Director Patrick Albaladejo said today in a phone interview. “There is no such
project in Hermes.”  British newspaper The Daily Mail reported that Hermes was
tipped to buy Somerset, England-based Mulberry for 1.5 billion
pounds ($2.3 billion), sending the shares up as much as 8.5
percent in London. After Hermes’ denial, Mulberry fell as much
as 1.5 percent and was unchanged at 1,300 pence as of 11:00 a.m.
The stock has gained 10.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
