Ethanol weakened against gasoline as
corn dropped to the lowest price in a week, reducing production
costs for the biofuel.  The spread narrowed 1.35 cents to 72.47 cents a gallon as
corn, the primary ingredient used to make the additive in the
U.S., sank the most since September on concern export demand for
the grain declined last week.  “Corn took a bloodbath today,” said  Terry Reilly , senior
commodity analyst at Futures International LLC in Chicago.
“Ethanol’s more correlated with the corn market. Margins
improved slightly.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery slipped 3.7 cents, or
1.5 percent, to $2.40 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Gasoline futures for April delivery dropped 2.35 cents, or
0.8 percent, to settle at $3.1247 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline,
which is made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to
filling stations.  Higher corn prices have eroded margins at ethanol plants
and prompted at least 19 companies to idle operations since
June, according to the  Renewable Fuels Association , a
Washington-based trade group.  Corn for March delivery tumbled 24 cents, or 3.3 percent,
to $7.08 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Crush Spread  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on March contracts, was
minus 14 cents a gallon, up from minus 23 cents yesterday. The
amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can
be fed to livestock.  U.S. export sales of corn and soybeans probably fell in the
week ended Feb. 28 from a year earlier, based on a survey of
four analysts by  Bloomberg News . The Agriculture Department is
scheduled to release its sales report at 8:30 a.m. tomorrow in
Washington.  Reilly said ethanol prices could rebound after the USDA
publishes its World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates
report at noon in  Washington  on March 8.  Ethanol  inventories  in the week ended March 1 fell for a
fifth week to 19.4 million barrels, the lowest level since Nov.
30. It was the longest set of declines since October 2010,
according to the report from the Energy Information
Administration, the Energy Department’s analytical arm.  Output Slips  Production in the U.S. fell 0.9 percent to 805,000 barrels
a day last week, 16 percent below the record 963,000 barrels a
day in December 2011, the report showed.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 94 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool, up from 88 percent in the week ended Feb. 22
and the highest level since Oct. 5, today’s report showed.  Under a 2007 energy law, U.S. refiners are required to use
13.8 billion gallons of ethanol this year and 14.4 billion in
2014.  The current production rate on an annualized basis is 12.3
billion gallons, or 11 percent short of the government target.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs,
which are used to track whether refiners are meeting the federal
biofuel-use mandates, has risen as supply has dwindled.  Corn-ethanol based RINs  rose to a record 76 cents yesterday
from 73.5 cents on March 4 and up from the 2013 low of 7.1 cents
on Jan. 7, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Advanced RINs, which include biodiesel and Brazilian-made
ethanol, jumped to a record 81 cents from 79.5 cents on March 4.  No Imports  The U.S. didn’t  import  any of the biofuel last week for the
first time since Feb. 1, today’s EIA report showed.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  cost $2.42 a gallon last week, or
about even with today’s futures price.  In cash market trading, ethanol fell at the major hubs,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in Chicago dropped 2 cents to $2.43 a gallon while
in the U.S. Gulf, the additive lost 2.5 cents to $2.485. The
biofuel in  New York  slipped 1.5 cents to $2.54 a gallon and on
the West Coast, the most expensive locale in the nation, it
decreased 1 cent to $2.62.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the Gulf climbed to 13.5
cents from 12 cents yesterday, and Chicago’s discount to New
York widened to 11 cents from 10.5 cents yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
