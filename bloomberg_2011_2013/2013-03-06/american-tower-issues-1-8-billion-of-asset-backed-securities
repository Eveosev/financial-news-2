American Tower Corp. (AMT)  sold $1.8
billion of bonds tied to wireless towers, according to a person
familiar with the offering.  The company paid 115 basis points more than Treasuries on
top-ranked debt maturing in 10 years, said the person, who asked
not to be identified because terms arenâ€™t public.  Companies have issued $39 billion of asset-backed
securities linked to business and consumer lending this year,
with auto debt accounting for about $19 billion, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance of the bonds is forecast to
climb 7 percent to $180 billion in 2013, according to Wells
Fargo & Co.  Sales of deals linked to unusual collateral like mobile
phone towers are poised to climb as investors seek out riskier
assets with the  Federal Reserve  holding its benchmark lending
rate close to zero into a fifth year.  Top-ranked bonds linked to auto loans are yielding 32 basis
points more than Treasuries, down from 63 basis points a year
ago, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  There are about $8.1 billion in asset-backed securities
linked to wireless towers outstanding, Barclays analysts led by
Joe Astorina said in a Feb. 28 report. Yields on the debt range
from about 1.5 percent to as much as 3.5 percent, according to
Barclays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
