Cie. de Saint-Gobain SA ’s record
European Union cartel fine was reduced to 880 million euros
($1.15 billion), or less than two percent, after regulators said
they corrected a calculation error in the original penalty.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (5202)  unit Pilkington also had its fine
cut to 357 million euros from 370 million euros, or 3.5 percent,
the European Commission said in an e-mailed statement today.  “The corrections became necessary because of two errors in
computing the fines,” the Brussels-based authority said in the
statement. “Some of the sales of these two companies should not
have been included in the sales figure used as a basis to set
their respective fines.”  Saint-Gobain,  Europe ’s largest building-materials supplier,
was handed an 896-million-euro penalty in 2008, the  highest EU
cartel fine  against a single company, for plotting with rivals
to fix the price of car windows sold to auto manufacturers from
1998 to 2003. Saint-Gobain’s penalty was increased because the
company was a repeat offender already punished for a separate
cartel to fix prices for glass used in the  construction
industry .  Saint-Gobain and Pilkington have challenged the fines at
the EU’s General Court in Luxembourg.  EU antitrust fines are based on sales of products concerned
and are capped at a maximum of 10 percent of companies’ total
annual revenues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
