Winston & Strawn LLP is opening a
Brussels office in June, which will be led by antitrust and
competition lawyer Peter Crowther. It will be the firm’s 16th
office and the fifth in  Europe .  “The roster of work for the global competition practice
continues to expand and the firm’s decision to open a Brussels
office is in line with expected growth,” Jeffrey Kessler,
partner and chairman of the firm’s antitrust and competition
practice, said in a statement. “Brussels already plays an
important role in our practice and we are excited about the
opportunity to provide a Brussels hub to support our already
extensive global cartel defense and EU competition practice.”  Crowther, a former Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP lawyer, joined
Winston & Strawn’s London office as partner in 2012. His
practice focuses on European Union merger control, international
and national cartels, state aid, trade/sanctions, free movement,
the firm said.  Venable Opens Delaware Office Led by New Bankruptcy Partner  Venable LLP opened a Wilmington,  Delaware , office, which
will be led by new bankruptcy partner Jamie L. Edmonson. She was
formerly a director at Wilmington-based Bayard PA.  “This is a terrific development for our firm and obviously
for the bankruptcy practice, given how often our work leads to
Delaware,”Venable’s bankruptcy and creditor rights practice
group chairman, Gregory Cross, said in a statement. “Jamie
Edmonson has been intimately involved in a wide range of Chapter
11 cases coming out of Delaware, including some of the biggest
filings.”  Edmonson has more than 16 years of experience handling
commercial bankruptcies, restructurings, insolvencies, and
liquidations, the firm said.  Venable has more than 500 lawyers at eight U.S. offices.  News  Ex-Kirkland Partner Freedman Pleads Guilty to Income Tax Fraud  Former  Kirkland & Ellis LP  senior partner Theodore Freedman
pleaded guilty to fraud in connection with the filing of false
tax forms.  Freedman changed his plea yesterday from not guilty to
guilty of four counts of tax fraud. U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts in  Manhattan  accepted the plea and set sentencing for
Sept. 17. Freedman’s lawyers reached a plea agreement with U.S.
attorneys.  Indicted in July 2011, Freedman misrepresented his income
as a partner at the law firm by about $2 million, the U.S. said.
He also claimed more than $500,000 in expenses for a sole
proprietorship that didn’t exist, the government said.  “I accept responsibility for the serious underreporting of
my taxes,” Freedman, 65, told the judge yesterday. “It has
been very hard for me to say these words.”  Freedman was a member of the firm’s restructuring group.
His income for the years 2001 through 2004 was $5.39 million,
compared with the $2.1 million he reported for the period, the
U.S. said in a statement. The tax loss to the government from
Freedman’s fraud was more than $1 million, the U.S. said.  At the time of his indictment, Kirkland & Ellis said it
“relates exclusively to Mr. Freedman’s personal conduct.
Accordingly the firm will not comment on the matter.”  The case is U.S. v. Freedman, 11-cr-00599, U.S. District
Court, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  Moves  SNR Denton Hires Class Action Team in Flurry of Hires  SNR Denton LLP hired a team of five class action and
insurance litigation lawyers, including three partners from
Gordon & Rees LLP. The firm also yesterday hired two additional
partners in different offices, along with two associates.  From Gordon & Rees LLP, the new partners include Fletcher
Alford, Laura Geist and Doug Scullion, who join the litigation
practice in the San Francisco office.  “Fletcher, Laura and Doug’s extensive class action and
consumer protection litigation experience is a perfect
complement to our practice, and they’ll add significantly to our
deep bench of litigators and to our growing San Francisco
office,” Roger Heidenreich, head of SNR Denton’s U.S.
litigation and arbitration practice, said in a statement.  The San Francisco trio is most active in life insurance and
annuity products matters, including market conduct and annuity
sales practices cases, as well as class actions in the
insurance, product liability, and financial-services sectors,
the firm said.  Gordon & Rees spokeswoman Colleen McGushin said in an e-
mail that the departing team will be missed, though, “Our depth
remains extremely robust and we will continue to build Gordon &
Rees’s national offices through the addition of excellent
attorneys, such as the group of eight new partners we added in
Philadelphia just a few weeks ago.”  Yesterday, SNR Denton also announced the hiring of Mark
Lunn, formerly of Arent Fox LLP, in the Washington office as a
partner in the international trade practice. Lunn has
represented clients in trade disputes and advises manufacturers
and government entities on cross-border and regulatory matters,
such as global trade policy, trade litigation, export controls
and sanctions and anticorruption statutes, the firm said.  Oil and gas lawyer John J. Harris also joined SNR Denton as
a partner in the Los Angeles office, along with two associates.
He was previously at Meyers Nave Riback Silver & Wilson. Harris
has more than 30 years of experience in energy law, with a
practice that focuses primarily on the oil and gas industry at
all stages of the commercial process.  The new hires yesterday come about three weeks before SNR
Denton is set to join forces with law firms Salans and Fraser
Milner Casgrain LLP, to create a new 2,500-lawyer firm named
Dentons.  The flurry of hires were in the pipeline and are unrelated
to the imminent combination, a firm spokesman said.  The merger to create Dentons, scheduled for March 28, will
give the new firm 79 locations in 52 countries.  Ex-FCC official Joins Mayer Brown Government and Trade Practice  Mayer Brown LLP said former Federal Communications
Commission official Angela Giancarlo joined its Washington
office as a partner in the government and global trade practice,  Giancarlo, who spent eight years at the FCC, will focus on
regulatory and compliance matters relating to communications
technology and services. At the FCC, Giancarlo held senior
management positions, including most recently chief of staff and
senior legal adviser to Commissioner Robert McDowell.  “Angela played an indispensable role in developing and
establishing communications technology policies that have
benefited our nation’s communications consumers,” McDowell said
in a statement.  Mayer Brown has lawyers at 20 offices in the U.S., Europe
and Asia.  Drinker Biddle Hires Private Client Partner in Philadelphia  Larissa Whitman joined Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP as a
partner in its private client group in Philadelphia. She was
previously a partner at  Montgomery McCracken Walker & Rhoades
LLP.   Whitman’s practice involves the representation of high net-
worth individuals and families in estate planning, personal
legal and tax-planning services.  Drinker Biddle has 650 lawyers in 11 U.S. offices and an

Angeles office as a partner in the real estate department. She
was most recently a partner at Gruenberg Garnett Harris LLP.  Garnett’s practice focuses on real estate and corporate
transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, leasing,
financings and joint ventures, the firm said.  She also has been vice president and general counsel of
Castle & Cooke Inc., the firm said.  Barnes & Thornburg has more than 600 attorneys and legal

Packard Co. (HPQ) ’s Autonomy unit, hired criminal defense lawyer Reid Weingarten, a partner at Steptoe & Johnson LLP.  Sushovan Hussain, who was Autonomy’s finance chief,
retained attorney John Keker, of  Keker & Van Nest LLP,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  Hewlett-Packard said in December that the U.S. Justice
Department had opened an investigation into the company’s
allegations that British software maker Autonomy misrepresented
its performance before being bought last year. The largest
personal computer maker booked an $8.8 billion writedown related
to Autonomy in November after concluding that some revenue had
been recorded prematurely or improperly.  Weingarten’s past clients include ex-WorldCom Inc. Chairman
Bernard Ebbers and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein. Keker, who is helping McGraw-Hill
Cos. and its Standard & Poor’s unit fight U.S. fraud claims,
also represented Black Panther Party leader Eldridge Cleaver and
banned cyclist Lance Armstrong, as well as vindicated investment
banker Frank Quattrone, Enron Corp. executive Andrew Fastow and
class-action lawyer William Lerach.  Lynch said in December that he will cooperate with any
investigation and rejected allegations of wrongdoing.  Weingarten and Keker didn’t immediately return phone
messages seeking comment. The person asked not to be named
because the matter isn’t public. The hiring of the lawyers was
reported earlier by the U.K.’s Daily Mail.  Separately, PGGM Vermogensbeheer BV, a Dutch pension
administrator, was appointed lead plaintiff in investor lawsuits
against Hewlett-Packard over the Autonomy writedown.  U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco
consolidated securities class action, or group, lawsuits against
the computer maker in an order March 4. PGGM, with $35.1 million
in losses from the drop in HP’s stock after the writedown was
disclosed, has the largest financial interest in the litigation,
Breyer ruled.  Hewlett-Packard agreed to buy Autonomy for $10.3 billion in
2011. More than $5 billion of the writedown was the result of
accounting practices at Autonomy, Hewlett-Packard said. About
$200 million of Autonomy’s revenue had been recorded prematurely
or improperly, the company’s general counsel said.  Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP was named lead
counsel in the securities class-action lawsuit. PGGM may propose
an alternate law firm to lead the case, Breyer said in his
ruling.  Law firms that lead group lawsuits manage and control the
single, consolidated case. A new, consolidated complaint will be
filed within 60 days, Ramzi Abadou, an attorney for PGGM at
Keller Topaz Meltzer & Check LLP, said in a phone interview. He
declined to comment further.  Individual investor Stanley Morrical was appointed lead
plaintiff in the lawsuits against Hewlett-Packard filed by
investors on behalf of the company. Burlingame, California-based
Cotchett Pitre & McCarthy LLP was named lead counsel for the so-
called shareholder derivative lawsuits, Breyer said.  The securities class action case is In Re HP Securities
Litigation, 12-cv-5980; the derivative case is Riccardi v.
Lynch, 12-cv-06003 and the employee case is In Re HP ERISA,
12-06199, all in U.S. District Court, Northern District of
 California  (San Francisco).  For more, click here.  Lawyers in Talks to Merge South African Mine Silicosis Lawsuits  Lawyers representing workers who contracted silicosis after
working on mines in South Africa say they will merge damages
lawsuits filed against  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) ,  Harmony Gold
Mining Co. (HAR)  and other employers.  “We have an in-principle agreement” to consolidate the
cases, Richard Spoor, who represents about 18,000 workers and
dependents of those who died from their illness, said in a
mobile phone interview yesterday. “We haven’t got final
agreement on the terms and we are having furious debates and
engagements to try and settle that.”  Spoor filed a damages  application  against 30 companies in
December last year. A separate suit by Abrahams Kiewitz
Attorneys brought in August on behalf of about 3,000 miners
seeks compensation from AngloGold, Harmony and  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)   South Africa’s highest court cleared the way for damages
claims to be brought against gold companies in March 2011 by
ruling that former miner Thembekile Mankayi could pursue a 2.7
million-rand ($300,000) claim against AngloGold. Gold companies
including AngloGold deny liability, and say they will oppose the
lawsuits.  “The respondents are off the hook,” Spoor said. “They
have got nothing to do until we sort out our own problems and
then give them a timetable to respond.”  The number of workers and dependents party to the Abrahams
Kiewitz lawsuit has swelled to more than 5,000 since August, and
is growing daily, said Charles Abrahams, a partner at the law
firm. He confirmed that the cases will be combined.  “What we are now busy doing is working out the mechanisms
with regard to how that will be given effect,” he said by phone
from Cape Town yesterday. “We are in process of communicating
that to the respondent attorneys.”  Silicosis is caused by prolonged exposure to dust in mines,
leaving irreversible scar tissue in lungs and making it hard to
breathe. It also heightens the risk of contracting tuberculosis.  For more, click here.  Video  Virgin Media’s Lawyer on Liberty Global Deal  Timothy Peterson, partner and member of the securities
