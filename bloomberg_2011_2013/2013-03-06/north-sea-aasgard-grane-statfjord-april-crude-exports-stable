Exports of North Sea Aasgard, Grane
and Statfjord crudes will be stable in April while shipments of
Gullfaks will drop by one cargo to six lots, according to
separate loading programs obtained by Bloomberg News.  Sales of Grane will be four lots of 600,000 barrels each in
April, the same as this month, the plan showed. Seven Aasgard
consignments of 855,000 barrels will be shipped next month,
unchanged from March, according to a separate schedule.  Statfjord loadings will total five consignments in April,
comprised of three lots of 800,000 barrels and two of 855,000
barrels, the program showed. That compares with four 800,000
barrel cargoes and one of 855,000 this month.  The six Gullfaks lots are made up of five 800,000 barrel
cargoes and one of 855,000 in April, according to the plan.
March loadings of the grade total six lots of 800,000 barrels
and one of 855,000.  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway â€™s largest oil and gas producer,
operates the four fields. Loading programs are monthly schedules
of crude shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers
and sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
