Chile’s peso weakened as reduced
expectations for further Federal Reserve stimulus boosted the
 U.S. dollar  and after copper, the Andean nation’s top export,
fell to the lowest since November.  The peso ended the session in Santiago less than 0.1
percent lower at 473 per dollar after touching 473.4, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Dollar Index, which measures
the greenback against the currencies of major trading partners,
rose 0.5 percent to 82.466.  The greenback rallied after the Philadelphia Fed President
 Charles Plosser  said the central bank should slow the pace of
its bond purchases because the potential costs from more
stimulus outweigh the benefits. U.S. companies added more
workers in February than economists forecast, a private report
based on payrolls indicated today.  “We still see differing views on when the U.S. should end
its stimulus measures,” Sergio Tricio, head of research at
ForexChile, said in an interview.  Copper fell 0.6 percent in  New York  amid a rise in
inventory levels and as a stronger dollar made commodities less
appealing as an alternative investment.  The peso rose 0.3 percent yesterday, its biggest gain in
six weeks, after the central bank reported that a proxy for
gross domestic product expanded 6.7 percent in January from a
year earlier, beating the median forecast of 6.5 percent growth
in a survey of economists by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
