Mexico ’s peso fell for the first
time in four days on speculation policy makers will lower
benchmark borrowing costs as soon as this week.  The peso depreciated 0.2 percent to 12.7315 per U.S. dollar
at 10:18 a.m. in Mexico City. The currency has dropped 1.2
percent since Banco de Mexico indicated on Jan. 18 that a
reduction in the 4.5 percent target lending rate “may be
advisable” if inflation keeps slowing.  Today’s peso drop is “probably mostly due to the rate
decision,” Aryam Vazquez, an economist at Wells Fargo & Co.,
said in an e-mailed response to questions. “Growth concerns,
whether related to the U.S. or Mexico, are an important factor
in determining rate expectations.”  Orders to U.S. factories fell 2 percent in January, the
most in five months, the Commerce Department reported today in
 Washington . Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports to its
northern neighbor.  Mexico’s central bank will hold its  target lending rate  at
a record low for a 33rd meeting on March 8, according to the
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
