Mexico’s exchange has canceled some
erroneous trades that caused shares of billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s
 Minera Frisco SAB (MFRISCOA)  to double in price, according to a bourse
official with direct knowledge of the decision.  A technical glitch at the bourse prompted the stock to soar
as much as 104 percent in intraday  trading , said the person, who
asked not to be named because he hadn’t been authorized to speak
on the matter. The canceled trades took place around the last 10
minutes of the trading day, and they accounted for volume of
about 250,000 shares, the person said.  Roberto Gavaldon, a stock exchange spokesman, didn’t
respond to a phone call and e-mail seeking comment on the
trades. Aurelio Bueno, a press official for the National Banking
and Securities Commission, said the nation’s regulator was
reviewing the jump in Frisco’s price.  Minera Frisco said in an e-mailed response to questions
that the company has “no knowledge” of any reason for the
share move today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
