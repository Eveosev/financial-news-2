Pope Francis named Archbishop Pietro
Parolin, apostolic nuncio to  Venezuela , to replace Tarcisio Bertone as the Vatican’s secretary of state, one of the most
important posts in the Catholic Church.  Parolin, 58, will take over from the 78-year-old cardinal,
who has been in the job for seven years, on Oct. 15, the Vatican
said in a statement posted on its  website  today.  The secretary of state is similar to a prime minister,
formulating the Vatican’s politics and diplomacy. Unlike
Bertone, who had no diplomatic background when he was appointed,
Parolin served as Vatican undersecretary for foreign affairs
from 2002 to 2009.  Pope Francis, who in March inherited a church dealing with
the fallout from sexual abuse scandals, is trying to rejuvenate
a faith that is in decline in  Europe . He is taking steps to make
the Vatican bank more transparent.  The Curia, the Vatican’s administrative body, came in for
public scrutiny last year after former Pope Benedict XVI’s
personal butler, Paolo Gabriele, leaked secret papal documents
and letters to the press. The material portrayed the Vatican as
a hotbed of conspiracy and Benedict as a frail leader, unable to
control his subordinates.  Bertone, as depicted by the Italian journalist who wrote a
book based on the documents, allegedly plotted to stymie rivals
and covered up for corruption and cronyism. The cardinal’s
response to the expose was that “many journalists are trying to
imitate  Dan Brown ,” author of the “Da Vinci Code.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
