Defence Department statement.  No one was hurt during the collision and HMCS Algonquin and
HMCS Protecteur should return to  Canada  later today, Canadian
Press said.  HMCS Algonquin was damaged significantly to her port side
hangar and wonâ€™t be deployed as planned to Asia Pacific.  The Royal Canadian Navy Board of Inquiry will investigate
