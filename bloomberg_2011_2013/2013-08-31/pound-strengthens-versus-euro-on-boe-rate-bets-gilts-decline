The pound strengthened against the
euro this week, posting the biggest monthly gain in a year, as
investors bet the  Bank of England  will raise interest rates
sooner than it projects amid better-than-forecast economic data.  Gilts fell for a sixth week, the longest losing streak
since June 2007, after BOE Governor  Mark Carney  failed to
convince markets that policy makers will keep rates at an all-time low at a speech on Aug. 28 as he offered to ease liquidity
rules for U.K. banks. Two-, five- and 10-year gilt yields have
climbed since Carney said Aug. 7 that officials will not
consider raising rates before unemployment reached 7 percent so
long as price and financial stability aren’t jeopardized.  “We were bearish on the pound going into the speech and we
came out it quite disappointed,” said Michael Sneyd, a currency
strategist at BNP Paribas SA in London. “Carney didn’t seem too
concerned about the rise in short-term yields. We thought he
could have been more aggressive. Sterling has strengthened
against the euro after the event.”  The pound advanced 0.7 percent this week to 85.31 pence per
euro at 5 p.m.  London  time yesterday, having strengthened 2.5
percent in August, the biggest monthly gain since July 2012. The
U.K. currency weakened 0.6 percent this week to $1.5470.  The pound strengthened at least 0.5 percent against all of
its 16 major peers this month as Citigroup Inc.’s Economic
Surprise Index for the U.K. rose to the highest level on Aug. 19
since November, indicating data has beaten analysts’ estimates.  Forecasts Raised  The British Chambers of Commerce yesterday raised its
economic forecasts and said U.K.  gross domestic product  will
increase 1.3 percent this year, up from a previous projection of
0.9 percent. Separate reports showed mortgage approvals rose to
60,624 in July, the most in more than five years, while GfK NOP
Ltd.’s consumer sentiment index increased to minus 13 this
month, the highest since October 2009.  An  gauge  of services output based on a survey on  purchasing
managers  expanded for an eighth month in August, according to
the median estimate of 26 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
before the data is published on Sept. 4.  Bank of England policy makers have kept the main  interest
rate  at a  record-low  0.5 percent since March 2009 and will
announce their next decision on Sept. 5.  The 10-year gilt yield increased six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to end the week at 2.77 percent. The rate rose
to 2.84 percent on Aug. 29, the highest since Aug. 1, 2011. The
2.25 percent bond due in September 2023 fell 1.01, or 10.10
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 95.465.  The Debt Management Office is scheduled to auction 1.5
billion pounds of inflation-linked bonds due in 2024 on Sept. 3,
as well as 2.5 billion pounds of bills on Sept. 6.  Gilts lost investors 3.5 percent this year through Aug. 29,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German bonds dropped
2.2 percent and Treasuries declined 3.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
