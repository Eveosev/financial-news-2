Manchester United is preparing an
improved bid for Athletic Bilbao midfielder Ander Herrera after
having a 21 million-pounds ($33 million) offer rejected, the
Daily Mail reported.  The Premier League champion also failed with an offer of 10
million pounds for Roma’s Daniele De Rossi and manager David
Moyes is still hopeful of signing Everton’s Marouane Fellaini as
he seeks to add two midfielders before the transfer period ends
in two days, the Mail said.  Bilbao wants United to meet the 25.5 million-pounds buyout
clause for Herrera, who has expressed a desire to leave, the
Mail said. Roma has ruled out a loan move for De Rossi and told
United to increase its offer, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
