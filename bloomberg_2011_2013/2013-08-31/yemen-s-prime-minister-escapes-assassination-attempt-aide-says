Yemen’s Prime Minister Mohamed Salem Basindwah escaped injury today when gunmen shot at his convoy in
the capital of Sana’a, an adviser to the prime minister said.  Basindwah was returning from a meeting with political
leaders when attackers fired at the vehicles, according to Rajeh
Badi, an adviser to Basindwah. The attack occurred close to the
prime minister’s home, Badi said in a phone interview. The
suspects escaped and were being pursued by police, Badi said.  Yemen’s government has fought al-Qaeda militants, whose
threats prompted the U.S. State Department on Aug. 6 to reduce
the number of personnel in the country.  The U.S. closed its mission in the country, along with
those in 21 other countries, after intercepting a message from
 Ayman al-Zawahiri , Osama bin Laden’s successor as al-Qaeda chief
in  Pakistan , to Nasir al-Wuhayshi, head of the organization’s
Yemeni branch.  The U.S. embassy in Yemen reopened to provide limited
public services on Aug. 20. U.S. drones regularly target leaders
and operatives of the Yemeni branch of al-Qaeda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
