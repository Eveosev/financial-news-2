Phil Mickelson  and Brian Davis each
shot an 8-under 63 to earn a share of the lead going into
today’s second round of the Deutsche Bank Championship, the
second event in the U.S. PGA Tour’s playoff series.  Kevin Stadler is in second place at 7-under 64 at the TPC
Boston golf course in Norton, Massachusetts, while Hunter Mahan,
 Sergio Garcia  and Roberto Castro are tied for fourth at 6 under.  Mickelson shot 28 on his first nine, tying a personal
career-low nine-hole score and the back nine scoring record at
TPC Boston.  “It’s really fun. You actually feel like there’s less
pressure,” Mickelson said. “I feel like I didn’t have to knock
it stiff because I was making putts.  I just had to get it on
the green to give myself a chance and a lot of the ones went
in.”  Mickelson parred five of his last nine holes to end his
chance of shooting a 59.  “After I did not birdie four and missed the (putt) on
three from about 15 to 18 feet, I stopped thinking 59 and was
trying to get one or two more (birdies) coming in and shoot
something in the low 60s,” the British Open champion said.  Mickelson played his first round with world No. 1 Tiger Woods, who ended the day at 3-under 68, and Masters champion
 Adam Scott , who carded a 2-over 73.  “What Phil did today was pretty impressive,” Woods said
after his round.  Sixteen players, including PGA Championship winner  Jason Dufner , Steve Stricker,  Matt Kuchar ,  Ian Poulter  and Lee Westwood, are tied at 5-under 66.  Defending champion Rory McIlroy is tied for 56th place
after a 1-under 70.  To contact the reporter on this story:
