Coca-Cola Femsa SAB (KOFL) , the largest
bottler of the soft drink in  Latin America , agreed to buy
Brazil’s Spaipa SA Industria Brasileira de Bebidas in a cash
deal with a total transaction value of $1.86 billion.  The deal, Coca-Cola Femsa’s second acquisition in Brazil in
three months, will bolster its volume in South America’s largest
nation by 40 percent, the Mexico City-based bottler said in a
statement today. When the purchase closes, pending approval by
the Brazilian antitrust authority, the Mexican bottler said it
would account for 39 percent of the Coca-Cola system’s volume in
Brazil.  The Spaipa deal is Coca-Cola Femsa’s largest since its 2002
acquisition of Miami-based Panamerican Beverages Inc., or
Panamco, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and it comes
on the heels of a $4 billion shopping spree in Mexico, Brazil
and the  Philippines  since June 2011. The Spaipa footprint
provides a “perfect geographic fit,” Femsa said in the
statement, linking Coca-Cola Femsa’s distribution territories in
the states of  Sao Paulo  and Mato Grosso do Sul.  “Since the acquisition of Panamco 10 years ago our team
continues strengthening our leading position in the system in
Brazil, while consistently increasing the profitability of this
territory,” Coca-Cola Femsa Chairman Jose Antonio Fernandez Carbajal said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
