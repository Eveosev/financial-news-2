Ichiro Suzukiâ€™s two-run homer
contributed to a five-run fifth inning as the  New York Yankees 
defeated the Baltimore Orioles 8-5 in a Major League Baseball
game.  The Yankees (71-63), who are eight games behind the
American League East-leading Boston Red Sox, moved within a
half-game of the third-place Orioles (71-62) in the division.  CC Sabathia (12-11) allowed five runs on seven hits in 5
2/3 innings for the win. Mariano Rivera got his 39th save,
pitching a perfect ninth inning at Yankee Stadium.  Miguel Gonzalez (8-7) was relieved in the fifth inning
after he gave up seven runs on six hits, including home runs by
