President  Barack Obama  said he will seek congressional authorization to use military force against Syrian regime targets once Congress returns from its recess.  The president spoke from the Rose Garden at the White House, a day after he and Secretary of State  John Kerry  indicated that the administration wouldn’t wait for international backing or a definitive report from United Nations inspectors to respond to Syria’s Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack. Kerry said 1,429 people, including at least 426 children, were killed.  Congress is due to reconvene on Sept. 9.
