Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) , the world’s
largest maker of HIV medicines, sued  Merck & Co. (MRK)  seeking a court
order that the experimental hepatitis C drug sofosbuvir won’t
infringe patents.  Merck, which  sold  $502 million of its Victrelis hepatitis C
drug last year, contacted Gilead this month requesting it
license two patents Merck says are related to sofosbuvir,
Gilead’s attorneys said a complaint filed today in federal court
in  San Francisco .  Merck, based in  Whitehouse Station , New Jersey, asked
Gilead to pay a 10 percent royalty on the net sales of the
medicine until the patents expire, a request “meant to threaten
Gilead” on the eve of U.S. regulatory approval of sofosbuvir,
according to the complaint. Gilead seeks a judge’s declarations
that the patents aren’t enforceable or infringed so it won’t
have to license them to sell the medicine.  Gilead, based in Foster City California, said June 7 that
sofosbuvir will receive a priority marketing review by U.S.
regulators with a target review date of Dec. 8.  Hepatitis C attacks the liver and can lead to  liver cancer .
The virus affects about 150 million people worldwide and the
market for new pills such as sofosbuvir is estimated at $20
billion.  Lainie Keller, a Merck spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail after regular business hours seeking
comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Gilead Sciences v. Merck, 13-04057, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
