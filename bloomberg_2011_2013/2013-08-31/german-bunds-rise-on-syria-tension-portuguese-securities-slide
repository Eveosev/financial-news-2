Germany ’s government bonds advanced
for the first time in four weeks as the prospect of a U.S.-led
military strike on Syria revived demand for the safest fixed-income assets.  Benchmark  10-year bund yields  fell from the highest level
in 17 months as reports this week showed the euro-area
 unemployment rate  stayed at a record high in July, while
inflation slowed in August. Portuguese bonds dropped for a
second week as a court’s opposition to ending labor contracts
for some state workers raised concern the nation will struggle
to meet its deficit targets. Spanish and Italian bonds declined
as European stocks slumped and oil jumped to a six-month high.  “The key factor behind the change in dynamics was clearly
the tensions in Syria,” said  Vincent Chaigneau , global head of
rates and foreign-exchange strategy at Societe Generale SA in
Paris. “Not only is there a geopolitical risk supporting some
flight to quality, but also the rise in  oil prices  could be a
threat for the recovery of the developed economies, and that’s
proved positive for bunds.”  Germany’s  10-year yield  fell eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, this week to 1.86 percent after climbing to
1.98 percent on Aug. 23, the highest level since March 2012. The
1.5 percent bund due in May 2023 fell 0.685, or 6.85 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,319) face amount, to 96.865.  The bonds of other core markets also advanced. The Dutch
 10-year yield  dropped four basis points to 2.29 percent, and
 Austria ’s fell four basis points to 2.30 percent.  Military Strike  French President  Francois Hollande  said in an interview
published yesterday the country may act as the principal U.S.
ally in a military strike on Syria, after British lawmakers
pulled the U.K. out of a mission to punish the use of chemical
weapons. Pentagon planners are considering whether an attack
would aggravate the civil war by triggering reprisals.  Portuguese 10-year yields  climbed to the highest level in
almost six weeks yesterday after the  Constitutional Court  said
on the previous day that the government’s proposed plan to scrap
contracts for some state workers was not constitutional.  Portugal’s  10-year yield  climbed 17 basis points this week
to 6.73 percent after rising to 6.79 percent yesterday, the
highest level since July 22.  The euro-area jobless rate stayed at 12.1 percent last
month, the European Union’s statistics office said yesterday.
Consumer prices rose 1.3 percent in August from a year earlier
after a 1.6 percent gain in July, the statistics office said.  Spain’s (GSPG10YR)  10-year yield rose eight basis points this week to
4.54 percent and similar-maturity  Italian rates  climbed eight
basis points to 4.40 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped
2.4 percent, while  Brent crude  climbed to as high as $117.34 a
barrel on Aug. 28, the most since February.  European Central Bank policy makers will keep their
benchmark  interest rate  at a record-low 0.5 percent when they
meet on Sept. 5, according to a Bloomberg News survey. Austria,
Germany, Spain and France are selling bonds next week.  German bonds lost 2.2 percent this year through Aug. 29,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italian securities
returned 3.7 percent and Spain’s rose 7.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
