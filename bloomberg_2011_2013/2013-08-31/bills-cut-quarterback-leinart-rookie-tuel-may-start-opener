Quarterback  Matt Leinart  was one of
18 players cut by the  Buffalo Bills , setting the stage for Jeff
Tuel to become the first undrafted rookie quarterback to start a
National Football League season opener.  The Bills plan to start Tuel in the home opener against the
 New England Patriots  on Sept. 8 if EJ Manuel, the team’s 16th
overall draft pick who is recovering from a minor procedure on
his left knee, cannot play, coach Doug Marrone said earlier this
week.  “Right now we’re planning on Jeff Tuel playing the first
game and we’re working with EJ to get back as quickly as
possible,” Marrone told reporters, according to the team’s
website.  The Bills yesterday placed quarterback  Kevin Kolb  on the
injured reserve list while he recovers from concussion-like
symptoms that followed his injury in the team’s preseason loss
against the  Washington Redskins  on Aug. 24.  Tuel, 22, who signed as an undrafted free agent in April,
will be the first undrafted rookie quarterback since 1967 when
the common draft era began to start an NFL team’s season,
according to the Elias Sports Bureau.  Tuel appeared in 31 games, going 531-of-865 for 5,936 yards
and 33 touchdowns at Washington State University. He recorded
one 400-yard game, five 300-yard games and nine 250-yard
contests and also ran for two touchdowns.  Last season, he led the team in passing, completing 212 of
333 passing attempts for 2,091 yards.  Leinart joined the Bills along with Thaddeus Lewis, who was
acquired by Buffalo in a trade with the  Detroit Lions .  Leinart’s Resume  Leinart, 30, has played with the Oakland Raiders, Houston
Texans and Arizona Cardinals over the past four National
Football League seasons. A first-round draft pick of the
Cardinals in 2006, Leinart won college football’s Heisman Trophy
at the  University of Southern California  in 2004.  He was waived by the team the day after the Bills’ 35-13
preseason loss to the Lions. Leinart completed three of 10
passes for 11 yards and two interceptions.  Lewis, 25, spent the past two seasons with the Cleveland
Browns -- mostly as a member of their practice squad -- before
starting the team’s 2012 regular-season finale. The Bills sent
linebacker Chris White to the Lions for Lewis, who entered the
NFL in 2010 as an undrafted free agent from  Duke University .  Lewis completed seven of 16 passing attempts for 132 yards
and a touchdown in the Bills’ loss to Detroit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
