Third baseman  Miguel Cabrera  left
the game early with abdominal pain for the second straight night
as the Detroit Tigers beat the Cleveland Indians 7-2 in a rain-shortened game.  Victor Martinez  doubled twice and drove in two runs for the
American League Central-leading Tigers, who have a 7 1/2-game
lead over the Indians.  Cabrera, 30, left after two innings of last night’s game,
which was called after seven innings at Comerica Park in
Detroit.  The previous night, Cabrera exited after he aggravated his
two-month-old abdominal injury by trying to stretch a fifth-inning single into a double with an awkward slide against the
 Oakland Athletics .  Cabrera, who struck out in his only plate appearance last
night, leads  Major League Baseball  with 130 runs batted in and a
.358 batting average. He also has 43 home runs, second only to
the 47 of Baltimore’s Chris Davis.  Cabrera was selected as the American League’s Most Valuable
Player last year after becoming the first major leaguer in 45
years to win the Triple Crown by leading his league in home
runs, RBIs and batting average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
