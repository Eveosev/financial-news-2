Mexico ’s peso rose for the first
time in five days on a newspaper report that  Spain  will announce
an economic reform program allowing the country to seek a
bailout, spurring demand for higher-yielding assets.  The currency appreciated 0.1 percent to 12.8416 per  U.S.
dollar  at 12:10 p.m. in Mexico City, extending its rally this
year to 8.4 percent, the biggest gain among the dollar’s 16
most-traded counterparts tracked by Bloomberg. Today’s advance
pared the peso’s loss this week to 1 percent.  “Improved global risk perceptions, driven mainly by
aggressive liquidity fixed by the leading central banks and
speculation that the EU is readying a financial bailout for
Spain, are supportive of the peso today,” Aryam Vazquez, an
economist for global  emerging markets  at  Wells Fargo & Co ., said
in an e-mailed message.  Spain’s Economy Minister Luis de Guindos is in talks with
European Commission authorities to facilitate a new bailout
program that will be presented Sept. 27, the Financial Times
reported, citing unidentified officials involved in the
discussions. Concern over how Europe’s debt crisis is weighing
on the global economy and lower demand for Mexican exports
helped make the peso Latin America’s worst-performing major
currency in 2011.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 fell
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.54 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.38
centavo to 139.51 centavos per peso. Yields on the debt have
decreased 19 basis points on the week, the most on a closing
basis since the period ended July 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
