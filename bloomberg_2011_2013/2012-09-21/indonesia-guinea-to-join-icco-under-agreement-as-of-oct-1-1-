The International Cocoa
Organization said Indonesia, Guinea and the  Democratic Republic 
of Congo will join the group under a cocoa agreement on Oct. 1.  That will bring membership to 47 from 44, Jean-Marc Anga,
acting  executive director  of the ICCO, said at a press briefing
in London today. Anga said he agreed to become the permanent
executive director as of Oct. 1 and that the ICCO will move its
headquarters to the west of London next year. A relocation to
Abidjan,  Ivory Coast , the world’s largest cocoa producer, will
be considered in September 2015, he said.  The ICCO has approved a study at the request of Ivory Coast
about starting a commodity exchange in West Africa, modeled
after the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange, Anga said. It won’t
necessarily just be for cocoa, he said.  Cocoa production in the 2012-13 year will probably be lower
than the current season because of dry weather in West Africa
and demand will be higher, leaving another shortage,  Laurent Pipitone , senior statistician at the ICCO, said at the briefing.
The ICCO is keeping its estimate for a shortage of 19,000 tons
for the current season, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
