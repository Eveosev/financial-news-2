The U.K. may see frost tonight as
temperatures fall in northern areas, the national weather
forecaster said.  Frost is possible across much of England and  Scotland , with
conditions more “widespread” in the north and west, according
to  reports  posted today on the Met Office’s website.
Temperatures in southwest Scotland may be as low as minus 2
degrees Celsius (28 degrees Fahrenheit).  Crops still needed to be collected on about 5 percent of
the U.K. wheat area and 20 percent of spring rapeseed and oat
fields, the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board said
yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
