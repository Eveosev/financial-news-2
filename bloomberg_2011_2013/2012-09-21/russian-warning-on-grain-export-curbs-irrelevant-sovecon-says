Andrei Sizov Jr., the managing
director of  SovEcon , a Moscow-based agricultural consultant,
comments on Economy Minister Andrei Belousov’s warning that the
government may consider grain export curbs. Deputy Prime
Minister  Arkady Dvorkovich  was later cited by Interfax as saying
there were no such plans.  Sizov spoke by phone today from Moscow.  “The exports situation won’t be changed. This is
irrelevant information for exports.”  “The top authority in charge of agriculture in  Russia  is
the  Agriculture Ministry  and Dvorkovich stays above it
supervising the sector. They both said that while they are in
power, there won’t be any export restrictions.”  “In principle, nothing has changed. As we expected, the
most probable scenario is that grain exports will continue to
diminish in size itself and there won’t be any government
measures needed for that.”  “Russia’s wheat in the country’s European part is more
expensive than wheat in  Europe . Russian wheat prices on a free-
on-board basis in Novorossiysk are $250 to $255 a metric ton
now, while they are below $250 a ton in Europe.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
