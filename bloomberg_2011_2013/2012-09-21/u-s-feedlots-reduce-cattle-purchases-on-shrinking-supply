     Sept. 21 (Bloomberg) --U.S. feedlots bought 11 percent
fewer cattle in August than a year earlier, a bigger than
expected decline, on signs that the number available for sale
shrank and higher corn costs curbed profitability.  Feedlots bought 2.002 million head of cattle last month,
down from 2.246 million in August 2011, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a report. Thirteen analysts surveyed
by  Bloomberg News  projected a 5.6 percent drop, on average. The
figure was the lowest for the month since the USDA began
tracking the statistic in 1996. The feedlot herd totaled 10.637
million as of Sept. 1, down 0.6 percent from a year earlier.
Analysts expected the inventory on feed to be little changed.  The price of corn, the main ingredient in livestock feed,
has surged 48 percent since June 15 as the worst U.S. drought in
56 years eroded the harvest potential. The strong feed costs
“curtailed interest in new calves and feeders,”  Rich Nelson ,
the chief strategist at Allendale Inc. in McHenry,  Illinois ,
said in an e-mailed report. The overall U.S. cattle herd on July
1 was the smallest since at least 1973 after a drought in the
Southern Plains last year spurred ranchers to cull herds.  “Last August, we had just really heavy placements because
of the drought in  Texas ,  Oklahoma , and  New Mexico ,” Troy
Vetterkind, the owner of Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage LLC, said
in a telephone interview. “Overall cattle numbers are down
compared to a year ago, and certainly there’s overall less
cattle to place.”  Feedlot operators buy year-old animals that weigh 500
pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The cattle
are fattened on corn for about four to five months until they
weigh about 1,200 pounds, when they are sold to meatpackers.  Feedlots sold about 1.96 million animals to meatpackers
last month, down 4.5 percent from a year earlier, the USDA said.
Analysts expected a 1.6 percent decline, on average.  Fattened cattle futures for December delivery were little
changed at $1.281 a pound at 12:50 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The price climbed 5.5 percent this year
through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement gained 0.2
percent to $1.4695 a pound, and the commodity was down 1.4
percent in 2012 before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
