Europe  should complete a probe into
alleged Chinese solar-panel dumping before the two sides begin
talks, the  lobby  group that made the claims said after German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  offered backing for negotiations.  “Before you can talk about an issue you need to know what
you’re talking about,” said Milan Nitzschke, president of EU
ProSun led by  Solarworld AG. (SWV)  The European Commission needs to
finish its investigation “as soon as possible,” he said.  The European Union began a probe two weeks ago covering 21
billion euros ($27 billion) of imports of crystalline silicon
photovoltaic panels, cells and wafers. Solarworld,  Germany ’s
largest panel maker, is among those seeking duties to counter
Chinese imports after the U.S. imposed its own restrictions.
Europe makes up about three-quarters of the photovoltaic market.  Merkel said this month the EU backs diplomatic talks to
resolve the issue. Chinese Commerce Minister  Chen Deming  talked
about the probe with EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht on
Sept. 19, the ministry said today in a statement on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
