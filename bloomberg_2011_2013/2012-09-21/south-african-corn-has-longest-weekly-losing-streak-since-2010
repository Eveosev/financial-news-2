South African corn futures headed
for the sixth straight weekly drop as global contracts declined
on signs of slowing demand in the U.S. after the worst drought
since 1956 drove prices to a record.  White corn for December delivery, the most active contract,
decreased 2.3 percent to 2,393 rand ($290) a metric ton by the
close on the Johannesburg-based South African Futures Exchange,
extending its retreat this week to 5 percent. The generic
contract for the grain the longest losing streak since January
2010.  U.S. corn headed for the biggest weekly drop in three
months as  export sales  tumbled 88 percent to 69,878 metric tons
in the week to Sept. 13 from a year earlier, the lowest for the
date since at least 2003, government data show. Corn futures in
the U.S., the world’s biggest producer of the grain, had rallied
to an intraday record of $8.49 a bushel Aug. 10.  “We are following the U.S price,” Thys Grobbelaar, an
analyst at Klerksdorp-based Senwes (Pty) Ltd., said by phone.
“Low prices encourage users of the seed to purchase more, but
it is bad news for the farmer planting the seed.”  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
The white variety is the nation’s staple food while yellow corn
is mainly used for  animal feed .  Yellow corn for delivery in December, also the most active
contract, dropped 2.3 percent to 2,380 rand a ton. December-
delivery soybeans declined 1.8 percent to 5,625 rand a ton.
Wheat increased 0.8 percent to 3,520 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
