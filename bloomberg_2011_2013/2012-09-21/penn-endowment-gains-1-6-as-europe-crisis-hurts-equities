The University of Pennsylvania, the
Ivy League school founded by  Benjamin Franklin , gained 1.6
percent on its investments in the year ended June 30, down from
a 19 percent increase in the previous year.  The value of the university’s endowment stood at $6.8
billion after accounting for gifts and distributions to help
cover operating costs at the Philadelphia-based school, Kristin Gilbertson, the university’s chief investment officer, said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Endowments and foundations had the worst returns of any
class of institutional investor, gaining on average 0.37 percent
for the year through June, consulting firm Wilshire Associates
said in an Aug. 6 report.  The debt crisis in Europe, which hurt the performance of
equity markets, caused the poor performance, Gilbertson said.  Penn’s results compare with a 5.5 percent gain, including
reinvested interest, by the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. (SPX)   Over the past decade, the endowment has had an annual
average return of 7 percent, Gilbertson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
