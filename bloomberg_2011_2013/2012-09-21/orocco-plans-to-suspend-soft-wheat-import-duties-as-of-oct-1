Morocco , North Africa’s third-
largest wheat buyer, will suspend  import duties  on soft wheat as
of Oct. 1, the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  Wheat imports starting next month should for a large part
be used for blending with local grain in the final months of
2012, and will serve to keep stocks at “a comfortable level,”
the ministry wrote in an online  statement  dated yesterday.  Morocco typically taxes soft wheat imports as of June 1 to
help local farmers sell their crop to the country’s millers,
before lowering or lifting the duties as the season progresses
and local supplies run out. This year’s soft-wheat harvest fell
to 2.7 million metric tons from 4.2 million tons in 2011, state
grain buyer ONICL and the ministry reported last month.  “The suspension of  customs duties  on soft-wheat imports
comes in a global economy characterized by the surge in global
cereal prices,” the ministry wrote.  Morocco will also introduce import restitutions next month
to make up the difference between the cost for buying wheat in
international markets and a government target price, aimed at
keeping the price of flour at the same level, the ministry said.  Milling wheat futures have climbed 34 percent on NYSE Liffe
in Paris since the start of the year to 262.50 euros ($341.67) a
ton on concern drought in Russia and  Ukraine  will reduce
availability.  Morocco’s wheat imports are forecast to jump to 5.1 million
tons in the 2012-13 season from 3.4 million tons a year earlier,
the International Grains Council forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
