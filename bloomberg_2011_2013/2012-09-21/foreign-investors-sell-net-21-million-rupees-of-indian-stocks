Foreign  investors  sold a net  21
million rupees  of Indian equities yesterday, reducing their
investment in the equities this year to 722.1 billion rupees, or
$14 billion, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 31.74 billion rupees of shares and sold
31.76 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of India
said on its  website  today. They bought a net 3.7 billion rupees
of bonds, taking total inflow into debt this year to 254.3
billion rupees, the data  show .  The benchmark  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  has increased 21
percent this year, helped by the biggest overseas equity flows
among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg. Flows surged to a
record in 2010, making the Sensex the best performer among the
world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led the
biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Foreigners have invested 5.166 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.462 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
