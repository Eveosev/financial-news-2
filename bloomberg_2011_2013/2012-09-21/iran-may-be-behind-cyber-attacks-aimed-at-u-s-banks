Cyber attacks against U.S. banks in
recent days may have been carried out by  Iran ’s government,
Senator  Joseph Lieberman  said.  “I don’t believe that these were just hackers,”
Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, said in an interview
with C-SPAN’s “Newsmaker” program. “I think that this was
done by Iran and the Qods force, which has its own developing
cyber attack capacity. And I believe it was a response to the
increasingly strong economic sanctions that the  United States 
and our European allies have put on Iranian financial
institutions.”  Lieberman said the attacks were targeted at  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM)  and  Bank of America Corp.  He wouldn’t disclose why he
believes that the Iranian government and its elite Qods Force,
an arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, were behind the
attacks.  “I don’t want to put it forward as a conclusion of the
intelligence community yet,” Lieberman said in the interview
set to air on Sept. 23. He said “there’s more than just theory
-- there’s some basis for believing that this was an Iranian
sponsored attack.”  NBC News this week cited national security officials it
didn’t identify as saying the Iranian government was behind
“denial-of-service” attacks on the banks. Such attacks are
intended to overwhelm a website by flooding it with requests.  The banking industry’s Financial Services Information
Sharing and Analysis center posted a warning  on its website 
dated Sept. 19 that warned of “recent credible intelligence
regarding” potential cyber attacks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
