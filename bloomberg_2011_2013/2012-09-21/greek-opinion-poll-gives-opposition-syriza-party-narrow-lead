Greece ’s main opposition Syriza
party would have a narrow lead over Prime Minister Antonis Samaras’s ruling  New Democracy  party if elections were held now,
a Metron Analysis poll for tomorrow’s edition of Ependytis
showed.  Syriza would get 27.7 percent of the votes compared with
the 26.9 percent it got in Greece’s  June 17  national election,
according to the survey of 1,002 people, received by email from
the Athens-based newspaper today. New Democracy would get 26.1
percent compared with 29.7 percent in the June vote, the poll
showed.  More than 57 percent of the people polled said the country
shouldn’t keep to pledges made to the European Union and
 International Monetary Fund  in exchange for 240 billion euros of
bailout funds as the policies have failed, compared with 40
percent who said it should stick to its commitments.  The poll, conducted on Sept. 18 and Sept. 19, had a margin
of error ranging from 1.8 percentage points to 3.3 percentage
points. The voter preference data strips out spoilt ballots as
well as invalid and undecided votes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
