Seagate Technology Plc (STX)  said fiscal
first-quarter sales will fall short of an earlier forecast,
citing a shrinking market for computer hard drives, its main
business.  Revenue for the current quarter, which ends Sept. 28, will
be 5 percent to 7 percent lower than its previous forecast of $4
billion, the company said in a  filing  yesterday. That indicates
sales of $3.72 billion to $3.8 billion. Analysts were
projecting, on average, sales of $3.93 billion, according to
 data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Seagate’s revision underscores ebbing demand for personal
computers and related components amid economic weakness and a
shift toward mobile devices, such as tablets, that mainly don’t
require hard drives.  Western Digital Corp. (WDC)  cut its forecasts
Sept. 13, a week after  Intel Corp. (INTC) , the largest maker of
computer chips, tempered expectations for sales.  Seagate, based in Dublin, predicted that the market for
hard drives in the quarter will be about 140 million units. It
has a 40 to 43 percent share, according to the filing. Seagate’s
market prediction matches that of  Western Digital , which this
month cut its projection from 157 million units.  Seagate’s gross margin, the percentage of sales remaining
after deducting the costs of production, will be about 30
percent, compared with higher than 30 percent predicted in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
