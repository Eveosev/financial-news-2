Stocks fell for the week, after the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  climbed to the highest level since
2007, as concern about slowing global growth overshadowed
optimism about central bank stimulus.  Financial and commodity shares dropped the most for the
week among  10 industry groups  in the S&P 500 as  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  and  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  declined more than 4.6 percent.  FedEx Corp. (FDX) 
and  Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC)  slumped at least 6.4 percent amid
disappointing forecasts, driving the Dow Jones Transportation
Average to its biggest weekly loss since November.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
climbed 1.3 percent amid its iPhone 5 debut that analysts say
will be the largest for any consumer electronics in history.  The S&P 500 slipped 0.4 percent to 1,460.15, snapping a
two-week rally. The benchmark index is up 16 percent for 2012.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 13.90 points, or 0.1
percent, to 13,579.47 during the week.  “We’re having a consolidation,”  Jason Cooper , who helps
oversee $2.5 billion in South Bend, Indiana, at 1st Source
Investment Advisors, said in a phone interview. “That can be
constructive in that we’re not just throwing money and not
thinking about our decisions. We’re starting to get a little bit
of an indication about what we could be seeing in terms of
earnings for some of these companies. A lot of them are going to
be very cautious.”  Equities slipped amid increasing signs that the global
economic slowdown is worsening. A Chinese manufacturing survey
pointed to an 11th month of contraction. Japan’s exports fell
while euro-area services and manufacturing output dropped to a
39-month low. In the U.S., more Americans than forecast filed
unemployment claims and a gauge of leading indicators slipped.
To spur growth, the Bank of Japan unexpectedly increased its
asset-purchase target.  Central Banks  The S&P 500 has jumped 14 percent from a June low amid
optimism central banks around the world will take steps to
stimulate the economy. Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve
unveiled another round of quantitative easing and the  European
Central Bank  announced specifics of its bond-buying plan.  While the rally brought the S&P 500 to its highest level
since December 2007 and within less than 10 percent of its all-
time high of 1,565.15, the index is trading at about 14.9 times
its companies’ reported earnings. That compares with an average
multiple of about 16.3 since 1954.  The S&P 500’s change was capped at 0.3 percent every day
for the week. The last time the index had a week with daily
swings of less than that was during the final week of 2010, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  ‘Little Surprising’  “The move that we’ve had in stocks may seem a little
surprising and investors are digesting all the policy actions
that have occurred,” Jeff Schwarte, a money manager who helps
oversee about $260 billion in Des Moines, Iowa, at Principal
Global Investors, said in a phone interview. “People are
sitting on their hands waiting for more data to support their
positioning.”  Companies whose earnings are most tied to economic swings
performed the worst for the week, with financial and commodity
shares falling at least 1.7 percent as a group. The Morgan
Stanley Cyclical Index tumbled 1.9 percent, the most since June.  Bank of America slipped 4.6 percent to $9.11. Alcoa
declined 7.2 percent to $9.13 as the biggest U.S. aluminum
producer was cut to hold from buy by Peter Ward, an analyst with
Jefferies Group Inc.  Commodities Tumble  Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR)  plunged 16 percent, the most
in the  S&P 500 , to $7.21. The second-largest U.S. coal producer
will close eight mines, eliminating 1,200 jobs and reducing
output in its biggest production cut since a boom in shale-gas
output began driving down fuel prices. The S&P GSCI Spot Index
of 24 commodities tumbled 4.4 percent for the week as crude
dropped the most since June.  The  Dow Transportation (TRAN)  slipped 5.9 percent, the biggest
weekly retreat since November. FedEx dropped 6.4 percent to
$84.39. The operator of the world’s largest cargo airline cut
its annual profit outlook because a weakening economy has
prompted shippers in the U.S. and overseas to switch to cheaper
delivery options.  Norfolk tumbled 13 percent, the most since March 2009, to
$65. The second-largest eastern U.S. railroad said third-quarter
profit will  fall short  of analysts’ estimates as volumes slid.
 CSX Corp. (CSX)  dropped 8.8 percent to $21.13, while  Union Pacific
Corp. (UNP)  slid 7.1 percent to $119.37.  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY)  sank 14 percent to $61.57. The
operator of more than 1,000 home-furnishing stores reported
second-quarter profit that trailed analysts’ estimates.  Penney Drops  J.C. Penney Co. dropped 10 percent to $25.89. Chief
Executive Officer  Ron Johnson ’s showcase of the stores’ new
layout on Sept. 19 failed to inspire confidence in his remake of
the 110-year-old retailer. Billionaire investor Michael Price
said in a “Bloomberg Surveillance” interview Sept. 21 that
he’s bullish on the company because it is “doing all the right
things” and will benefit from rising demand among U.S.
shoppers.  Phone stocks rose the most among the S&P 500’s 10 industry
groups, climbing 2.4 percent.  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , the third-
largest U.S. wireless carrier, rallied 7.4 percent to $5.65
after Chief Executive Officer Dan Hesse said the company would
probably play a role in future industry consolidation.  MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) , a prepaid carrier that
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. touted as a takeover target for Sprint,
increased 9.4 percent to $11.63.  Apple climbed 1.3 percent to $700.10 for an eighth straight
weekly gain, the longest stretch in three years. Apple may sell
as many as 10 million iPhones during the weekend sales rush,
according to  Gene Munster , an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos.  Homebuilders Rally  An S&P index of homebuilders rose 2 percent to the highest
level since August 2007 as sales of existing American homes rose
more than forecast and  KB Home (KBH)  reported an unexpected profit. KB
Home, the Los Angeles-based homebuilder that targets first-time
buyers, jumped 12 percent to $15.26.  Moody’s Corp. (MCO)  increased 4.5 percent to $45.80, completing
18 consecutive days of gains for the longest winning streak
since at least 1998. The world’s second-largest provider of
credit ratings raised its estimate for full-year earnings on
Sept. 12 as demand for its services boosts revenue amid rising
global bond sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
