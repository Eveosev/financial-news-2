The U.S., seeking to lower gasoline
prices before November’s presidential elections, may lead a
release of fuel from strategic stockpiles in the next three
weeks,  DNB ASA (DNB)  said.  Any move would be initiated by the U.S. in cooperation with
nations such as the U.K. and wouldn’t be coordinated by the
 International Energy Agency , said Torbjoern Kjus, a senior oil
analyst with Norway’s biggest lender, in an interview today in
Singapore. A stockpile release will take place for certain if
Brent prices reach $120 a barrel, he said.  “There is a very large chance that it can happen within
the next three weeks, because it has to happen in time before
the U.S. elections to bring the gasoline prices down,” Kjus
said. “In Europe, we have strategic stocks of oil products, but
in the U.S., they have strategic stocks of crude. So a lot of
things can happen in that respect.”  The U.S. has tapped the Strategic Petroleum Reserve 17
times since 1985. It currently holds about 695 million barrels
of oil, according to the  Department of Energy . White House
spokesman  Jay Carney  said Sept. 18 at a briefing that “all
options remain on the table” with regard to the SPR, the
largest stockpile of government-owned crude in the world.
Americans go to the polls on Nov. 6.  Brent oil for November settlement today climbed 88 cents to
$110.91 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Prices have gained 7.8 percent this year. Gasoline
futures in  New York  have risen 8.7 percent over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
