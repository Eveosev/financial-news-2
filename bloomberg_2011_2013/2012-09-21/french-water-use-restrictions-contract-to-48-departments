The number of  France ’s mainland
departments subject to limits on water use following dry weather
in August and at the start of September declined by two from a
week ago to 48, the  Environment Ministry  said.  The departments had at least one local limit or ban on
water use in place as of midnight, according to an online  report 
by the ministry today.  Restrictions were at “crisis” level in 28 departments,
meaning authorities implemented the most severe level of curbs,
including a ban on water use for agriculture, one less than
earlier this week, the report showed. The nation has 96 mainland
departments, or administrative areas, in total.  To contact the reporter on this story:
