OAO Gazprom (OGZD) ’s South Stream venture
said it will stick with its schedule for a planned natural-gas
pipeline to southern Europe after the European Union began an
antitrust investigation into the Russian exporter of the fuel.  The timeframe for the pipeline remains unchanged, Marcel Kramer, head of the venture, said today in Sochi, southern
Russia. Italy’s  Eni SpA (ENI) , Germany’s Wintershall AG and
Electricite de France SA are partners in the project.  Gazprom, the world’s biggest gas producer, plans to build
an underwater pipeline from Russia to Bulgaria along the Black
Sea floor and into central and southern European countries.
Russian President  Vladimir Putin  has ordered Gazprom to push the
start of construction forward to December this year from 2013.  EU regulators opened an investigation into Gazprom pricing
and supplies this month, while Gazprom has denied any breaches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
