Global equity funds lured the
largest weekly inflows this year after the  Federal Reserve  and
the  European Central Bank  announced monetary stimulus measures,
according to Citigroup Inc.  “The increased exposure is driven by liquidity injection
by central banks,” Yue-Hin Pong, an analyst at the brokerage,
wrote in an e-mail today. Equity funds attracted $17 billion in
the week ended Sept. 19, Pong wrote in a report with Markus Rosgen, citing data compiled by EPFR Global. Emerging-equity
funds drew $3.2 billion, while Latin America funds lured $846
million, the most since 2010, according to the report.  The Federal Reserve said last week it will expand its
holdings of long-term securities with open-ended purchases of
$40 billion of mortgage debt a month in a third round of
quantitative easing. European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said on Sept. 6 policy makers agreed to an unlimited
bond-purchase program as they try to regain control of  interest
rates  in the euro area.  “We expect some more switching to equities after its long
underperformance,” Citigroup’s Pong wrote in the e-mail.  Latin American funds were boosted by flows into Brazilian
exchange-traded funds, the analyst wrote. Asian-focused funds
attracted $219 million, while China funds lured $265 million,
according to the Citigroup report.  --Zhang Shidong. With assistance from Weiyi Lim in  Singapore .
