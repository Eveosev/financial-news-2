Kenya’s shilling weakened on
speculation monetary policy makers will keep cutting  interest
rates  as food-price inflation slows.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy fell less
than 0.1 percent to 84.80 a dollar by 11:19 a.m. in the capital,
Nairobi, heading for a 0.5 percent weekly drop, its biggest
since the five days through June 1, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  “Inflation expectations are currently heading south and we
would expect the central  bank rate  to follow on that lower
trajectory,” Raphael Agung, assistant general manager of
Treasury at Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said by phone from
Nairobi. “Food prices, which are a principal part of the
basket, have been trending lower with good rains.”  Kenya’s central bank cut  borrowing costs  for the second
consecutive meeting on Sept. 5, reducing its policy rate by a
total of 500 basis points, or 5 percentage points, to 13
percent, from a record high. Inflation eased for the ninth
consecutive month to 6.1 percent in August, from 7.7 percent in
July. Normal to above-normal rainfall is expected in  Kenya  in
the so-called October to December long rainy season.  Uganda ’s shilling dropped 0.4 percent to 2,520 a dollar,
heading for its weakest close in since Aug. 23, while Tanzania’s
currency gained for the first session in five, climbing 0.1
percent to 1,575.  To contact the reporter on this story:
