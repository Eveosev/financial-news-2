Danish mortgage bonds gained in
Copenhagen trading ahead of an anticipated rise in demand for
the securities from banks tapping three-year loans from the
central bank.  Bid yields on non-callable mortgage debt maturing in one to
three years fell, with Nykredit’s 2 percent bond due Oct. 1,
2013, and Realkredit Danmark’s 2 percent note maturing January
1, 2014, falling to their lowest in almost two weeks, data
available on Bloomberg showed.  Danish banks may borrow as much as 100 billion kroner ($17
billion) from the central bank when it opens the lending
facility for the second and last time on Sept. 28. The program,
originally intended to help banks avoid a liquidity squeeze, may
also be used for commercial purposes, Governor Nils Bernstein
said before the loans were first made available in March. His
comments opened the door for carry trades.  Banks tapping the three-year facility will probably use the
proceeds to buy short-term mortgage bonds of similar maturities,
said Jan Oestergaard, senior analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in
Copenhagen. The loans are offered against collateral at the
central bank’s lending rate, which was cut to 0.2 percent in
July.  Nykredit’s 2013 bond yielded 0.439 percent at 10:45 a.m.
local time, according to data available on Bloomberg. That was
the lowest rate since Sept. 10, when it yielded 0.422 percent.
Realkredit Danmark’s bond yielded 0.454 percent, compared with
0.439 percent on Sept. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
