A Russian court overturned a ruling
to shorten the prison term of  Platon Lebedev , former Yukos Oil
Co. owner  Mikhail Khodorkovsky ’s business partner.  The Arkhangelsk regional court in northwest Russia ordered
a fresh review of the request to cut his 13-year jail sentence
because of a change in the criminal code, Khodorkovsky’s defense
team said on its  website  today. The case will be sent back to a
district court in the Arkhangelsk region city of Velsk, where
Lebedev is imprisoned.  The Velsk court on Aug. 8 cut Lebedev’s jail term by term
by three years and four months, which would have allowed him to
be set free next March. Prosecutors appealed the decision.  Lebedev, 55, and his associate Khodorkovsky, once Russia’s
richest man and chief executive officer of Yukos, were sentenced
to eight-year terms for fraud and  tax evasion  in 2005 and
convicted again on related charges in December 2010. Their
sentences were extended to 13 years from their arrest in 2003.
Khodorkovsky, 49, says he was targeted by President  Vladimir Putin  for financing opposition parties, an accusation the
Kremlin denies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
