Bolivian President  Evo Morales 
pledged to ban the use of dynamite in the capital after unrest
between rival miner groups over a zinc and tin project seized
from  Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  left one person dead this week.  Morales, in a a speech broadcast by state Radio Patria
Nueva today, said his government is brokering talks between
cooperative mine workers and the Federation of Bolivian Mine
Workers as they fight for control of the Colquiri project that
was nationalized in June. The two rival groups currently control
different parts of the mine.  About 500 police and soldiers were sent to the mine after
cooperative miners dynamited the union’s offices in La Paz Sept.
18, killing one miner and wounding seven others, according to
Defense Minister Ruben Saavedra.  President Evo Morales, an ally of Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez , has raised taxes and seized mines, oil refineries and
power companies since taking power in 2006. He also nationalized
Glencore’s Vinto tin smelter in 2007.  Zinc for delivery in three months jumped 15 percent since
clashes at the mine began in early September to close at
$2,115.50 per ton in  London  today. Tin gained 7 percent this
month to close at $20,750 per ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
