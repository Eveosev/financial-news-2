Talanx AG,  Germany ’s third-biggest
insurer, received enough orders for all shares offered in a
planned sale, according to two people with knowledge of the
transaction.  Talanx said yesterday that it was reviving an initial
public offering it canceled last week in a bid to raise about
500 million euros ($650 million) to help finance its
international expansion. Thomas von Mallinckrodt, a Talanx
spokesman, declined to comment.  The Hanover, Germany-based insurer, led by Chief Executive
Officer Herbert Haas, yesterday revived the IPO plans it called
off last week and said it will offer as many as 26 million
shares, as well as 2.89 million registered shares in a potential
over-allotment at a price range of 17.30 euros to 20.30 euros.
The new stock is scheduled to trade as of Oct. 2.  Talanx, which has been considering the share sale for more
than a decade, is owned by German mutual insurer HDI
Haftpflichtverband der Deutschen Industrie VaG and owns a 50.2
percent stake in  Hannover Re , the world’s fourth-biggest
reinsurer.  Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance Co. will receive shares at the
IPO price from a 300 million-euro convertible bond that Talanx
 sold   Japan ’s third-largest life insurer in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
