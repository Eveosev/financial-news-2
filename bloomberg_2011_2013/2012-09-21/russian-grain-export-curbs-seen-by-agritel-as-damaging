Russian grain export curbs would
put the country’s exporters at risk of default, while such a
measure in 2010 was counter-productive because it resulted in
stockpiles and forced the country to sell at a discount the next
year, according to Gautier Le Molgat, an analyst at Paris-based
farm adviser Agritel.  Economy Minister Andrei Belousov said today  Russia  may curb
grain shipments should prices keep rising.  “It’s normal that someone who seeks to contain inflation
puts the emphasis on the  cost of food ,” Le Molgat said by phone
today.  “They’re in the  World Trade Organization  now, so they have
to pay a little bit more attention than in the past. And they’ve
seen in 2010 that this step was almost counter-productive,
because at the end of they year they’d built up big stocks.
Their clients dropped them and the next year they had to sell at
a big discount.”  “For it to make a difference, it has to be put in place
quickly, because Russian export activity is very high at the
start of this year. In any case we’re expecting export activity
to ramp down in the coming weeks. It’s hard to see how the
Russians will supply the export market in the second half if
they have the harvest that’s now expected.”  “It would be counter-productive, because it would put
exporters at risk of default.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
