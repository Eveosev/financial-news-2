The Philippine peso had its biggest
weekly loss in a month as signs of deepening slowdowns in  China ,
 Japan  and  Europe  worsened the outlook for the nation’s exports.  Reports yesterday indicated factory production in China
contracted for an 11th month in September, while manufacturing
and services output in the euro area fell to a 39-month low.
Japanese exports declined for a third month in August while the
surplus on the Philippines’ balance of payments narrowed,
official data showed this week.  “The slowing growth on the global economic front is
causing a sense of uncertainty,” said  Jonathan Ravelas , chief
market strategist in  Manila  at  BDO Unibank Inc. (BDO) , the nation’s
largest lender. “That creates short-term demand for dollars.”  The peso fell 0.6 percent this week to 41.665 per dollar in
Manila, according to data from Tullett Prebon Plc. It gained 0.2
percent today. The currency reached 41.358 on Sept. 17, the
highest since April 2008. One-month implied volatility, which
measures exchange-rate swings used to price options, was
unchanged at 5.25 percent.  Philippine exports to China fell 14 percent from a year
earlier in July, compared with a 39 percent gain in the same
month of 2011, official data show. Shipments to Japan shrank 28
percent versus growth of 85 percent a year earlier.  Shrinking Surplus  The country had a $582 million surplus on its balance of
payments in August, the central bank said Sept. 19, compared
with $3.2 billion in July. Unemployment rose to 7 percent in
July from 6.9 percent in April, the statistics office said on
Sept. 18.  The yield on the government’s 8 percent bonds due July 2031
climbed 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, this week to
5.75 percent, according to Tradition Financial Services. The
notes fell the most in four months before the treasury auctions
9 billion pesos ($216 million) of 2032 debt on Sept. 25.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas kept its benchmark overnight
rate at a record-low 3.75 percent on Sept. 13, and raised its
inflation forecasts for 2012 and 2013. Consumer prices rose 3.8
percent in August from a year earlier, after a 3.2 percent gain
in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
