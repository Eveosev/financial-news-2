Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s  Universal Music Group 
will win approval from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission today
to buy the recorded-music business of EMI Group, according to
two people familiar with the matter.  The FTC will approve the transaction with the same
conditions agreed to earlier today by European Union regulators,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the
decision isn’t yet public. Universal agreed to sell about a
third of EMI assets to cut the group’s combined market share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
