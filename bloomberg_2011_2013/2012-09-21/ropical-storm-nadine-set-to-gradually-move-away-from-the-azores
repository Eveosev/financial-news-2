Tropical Storm Nadine, the 14th
named storm of the Atlantic season that runs through to
November, is forecast to gradually move away from the Azores
islands, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.  Nadine was about 200 miles (325 kilometers) south of the
Azores, with winds of 65 miles per hour as it moved southeast at
8 mph, the Miami-based center said in an  advisory  at 5 a.m.
Atlantic Standard Time. A tropical storm warning remains in
effect for the Azores, the NHC said.  The center is also monitoring a system 475 miles east of
 Bermuda  that has a 60 percent chance of becoming a subtropical
cyclone in the next two days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
