Palm’s discount to  soybean oil ,
which reached the biggest in four years this month, is poised to
widen as output in Malaysia climbs, boosting  inventories  in the
second-largest grower. The tropical oil fell to the lowest level
since October 2010.  “Stock levels would climb because it’s peak-production
season,” said Hoe Lee Leng, an analyst at  RHB Capital Bhd. (RHBC) ,
who’s tracked the commodity for more than a decade. “The
discount could widen a little bit more before it narrows” after
output crests, she said, without giving a forecast.  Palm oil  has lost 13 percent this year on prospects for
rising output and slower demand, while soybeans surged 35
percent, touching a record, as drought in the U.S. scorched
fields and cut yields. That divergence helped drive the gap
between palm oil and the oil crushed from the beans to $319.94 a
metric ton on Sept. 5, the most since 2008. High soybean prices
may encourage farmers across  South America  to sow record crops.  The differential between palm and soybean oil will “stay
at a high level probably until the time you start to be sure
that you’re getting a good South American crop,” said James Fry, chairman of LMC International Ltd. “They’re planting
relatively early in South America where they can, because they
can see these wonderful prices.”  Palm oil, which competes with soybean oil for use in foods
and biofuels, fell to 2,763 ringgit ($905) a ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange today, the cheapest close since October
2010. Soybeans were at $16.275 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after peaking at $17.89 on Sept. 4.  Rival Oils  Soybean oil was at 54.97 cents a pound ($1,212 a ton) in
 Chicago , 4.9 percent higher since the start of the year and 15
percent above the year’s intraday low on June 15. The  gap
between the two  widened 4.9 percent to $307.92 a ton today, data
tracked by Bloomberg. The record is $493.76 in August 2008.  Malaysian palm-oil stockpiles may reach a record, Godrej
International Ltd.’s Dorab Mistry forecast on Sept. 6, without
giving a timeframe. Inventories gained to 2.12 million tons last
month, the highest level since October, according to data from
the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, which shows holdings reached an
all-time high of 2.27 million tons in November 2008. Output in
the country typically peaks between July and October.  “Your production numbers are going to continue climbing,”
said Hoe at RHB, who correctly predicted in April 2011 that palm
oil would be weaker in the second half last year than the first.
“After which, once you hit the peak, then it’s going to come
off and you should see the discount narrowing.”  Festival Seasons  The gap between the two oils is set to contract as high
soybean-oil prices will spur a switch to the tropical variety
ahead of festival seasons in India and  China , the biggest
cooking-oil consumers, according to Standard Chartered Plc.  “The spread is going to narrow because palm just looks
incredibly cheap,” said  Abah Ofon , a Singapore-based analyst at
the bank. “India and China are price-sensitive countries. Logic
suggests that they will go for the cheaper oil.”  U.S. soybean inventories will be the lowest since 1973 by
March, according to a forecast from INTL FCStone Inc. Both
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Godrej’s Mistry have a three-month
soybean price target of $20 a bushel.  Brazil ,  Argentina ,  Paraguay ,  Bolivia  and Uruguay will boost
soybean output 34 million tons to 148.5 million in 2012-2013,
more than offsetting a fall of about 11.5 million tons to 71.7
million in the U.S., the Department of Agriculture said Sept.
