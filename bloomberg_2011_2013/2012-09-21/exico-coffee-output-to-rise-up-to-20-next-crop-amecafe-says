Coffee production in  Mexico  will
increase as much as 20 percent in the next harvest to 5.16
million bags, the countryâ€™s growers association said.  Output will rise from 4.3 million in the current season,
Rene Avila, head of operations at the association known as
Amecafe, said today in a telephone interview from Mexico City.
The next crop year starts in October.  Exports will probably not increase at the same pace because
of rising domestic consumption, he said.  A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  To contact the reporter on this story:
