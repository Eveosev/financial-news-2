Gold climbed toward the highest in
almost seven months as economic data that trailed estimates
supported the case for more stimulus by central banks around the
world, increasing demand for the metal as a store of value.  Spot gold rose 0.2 percent to $1,771.35 an ounce at 9:51
a.m. in  Singapore , after ending Sept. 14 at $1,770.40. An
advance this week would be the fifth and the longest such run
since August 2011. Bullion reached $1,779.50 on Sept. 19, the
highest price since Feb. 29. Holdings in gold-backed exchange-
traded products expanded to a record 2,523.671 metric tons
yesterday and have risen 7.1 percent this year.  Data yesterday showed more Americans than forecast filed
 claims  for  unemployment benefits  and an index of U.S. leading
indicators fell for a second time in three months, while a euro-
area services and output gauge dropped to a 39-month low in
September.  Japan ’s exports declined in August and a Chinese
manufacturing survey pointed to an 11th month of contraction.  “We’ll get some consolidation on the way towards breaking
through the $1,780 to $1,800 resistance zone, but we expect gold
to get there eventually, especially if economic data doesn’t
show signs of improvement and central banks have to take more
steps to support growth,” Wang Xiaoli, chief investment
strategist at CITICS Futures Co., a unit of  China ’s biggest
listed brokerage, said from Shenzhen. “The uptrend in ETFs is
very encouraging and is reflective of more investors wanting to
own gold to hedge against inflation and macroeconomic risks.”  Monetary Stimulus  The  Bank of Japan (8301)  said this week it will add 10 trillion
yen ($128 billion) to a fund that buys assets, following the
U.S.  Federal Reserve ’s announcement last week of a third round
of stimulus. China approved infrastructure plans and the
 European Central Bank  this month gave details of a program to
buy the debt of  member states , after President  Mario Draghi 
pledged on July 26 to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro.
Since then, gold has risen 9.7 percent and the euro has climbed
5.7 percent against the dollar.  December-delivery gold rose as much as 0.3 percent to
$1,775.60 an ounce on the Comex, and was last at $1,773.70. The
contract climbed to a 29-week high of $1,781.80 on Sept. 19.
Fifteen of 29 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect prices to
rise next week and seven were bearish. A further seven were
neutral, extending the overall bullish outlook for an 18th week.  In China, spot gold of  99.99 percent purity  gained 0.5
percent to 359.11  yuan  a gram ($1,771.58 an ounce) on the
Shanghai Gold Exchange. Volumes for the benchmark contract on
the country’s largest cash bullion market almost doubled to
6,132 kilograms yesterday, from 3,309 kilograms on Sept. 19.  Spot platinum rose as much as 1.1 percent to $1,645.25 an
ounce, before trading at $1,640.25. The metal is 4 percent lower
this week and set for the first such drop in three weeks, after
a labor dispute was resolved in  South Africa , the world’s
largest producer, easing the threat to supplies.  Cash silver gained 0.2 percent to $34.75 an ounce, after
swinging between gains and losses. Palladium added as much as
0.8 percent to $667.50 an ounce, and was last at $666, down 4.4
percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
