  Spectrum Brands Holdings Inc. (SPB) , the
consumer-products company controlled by  Philip Falcone , is in
exclusive talks to buy the home unit of Stanley Black & Decker
Inc. for at least $1 billion, said a person with knowledge of
the matter.  The deal may be announced Oct. 1, said the person, who
asked not to be identified as the discussions are private.
Representatives at Stanley and Spectrum didn’t immediately
return calls seeking comment. Reuters reported earlier that
Spectrum had taken the lead in the bidding.  Stanley disclosed in July that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was
hired to explore a sale of the so-called hardware and home-
improvement unit. The operations were part of Black & Decker
Corp. before its 2010 merger with  Stanley Works . The division
makes Kwikset door locks and Pfister bathroom faucets.  Harbinger Group Inc. (HRG) , the New York Stock Exchange-listed
vehicle owned by Falcone’s Harbinger Capital Partners hedge-fund
firm, controls Spectrum.  The acquisition would add to Madison, Wisconsin-based
Spectrum’s collection of consumer brands, including Rayovac
batteries, Remington razors, and George Foreman electric grills.
Spectrum had $3.19 billion in fiscal 2011 revenue, while the
Stanley division had $940 million in sales last year.  Spectrum fell 2.8 percent to $40.34 at the close in New
York. Stanley rose 2.5 percent to $78.25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
