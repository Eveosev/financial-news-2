Russian leaders need to avoid
tough, “unequivocal” talk with business to make the economy
more competitive, Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  told an
investment forum in the southern Russian resort town of Sochi.  The government can’t hope to make the economy more
effective by “offers to send a doctor,” Medvedev said in a
speech broadcast by state television channel Rossiya 24 today.
“Russian business knows what I’m talking about.”  Medvedev was referring to a comment then-Prime Minister
 Vladimir Putin  made at a July 2008 industry meeting that
billionaire  Igor Zyuzin , the main owner of coal producer OAO
Mechel, was unable to attend because of illness. Putin said he
hoped Zyuzin would get well soon, “otherwise, we’ll need to
send him a doctor and clean up all these problems.” Days after
Putin’s remarks, then-President Medvedev called on authorities
to stop “causing nightmares” and intimidating business.  The comments criticizing the company for selling coal to
its Swiss unit at less than the domestic price wiped 50 percent
off  Mechel (MTLR) ’s American depositary receipts. The company was fined
790 million rubles ($25.5 million) and pledged to cut prices 15
percent. A year later, Putin said he regretted that the remarks
sent the company’s shares tumbling.  Medvedev, who stepped aside as president in May after
deciding not to challenge Putin, said these methods of steering
Russian business should become a thing of the past.  “I’d like it if we were able to start living
differently,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
