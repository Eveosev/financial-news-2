The  U.K. financial watchdog  asked
lawmakers for more enforcement powers, including an extension of
the statute of limitations on probes and the ability to
temporarily ban senior managers from their jobs while they are
under investigation.  The three-year limit on investigations can make pursuing
cases “more difficult,” the Financial Services Authority said
in a written submission the Parliamentary Commission on Banking
Standards made public on a  government website  today. The
regulator also requested the ability to “remove incumbent
senior managers where they continue to pose a risk” to an
investigation.  The FSA is aware it was seeking “a significant extension
to our current powers,” according to the statement, and
“appropriate safeguards would need to be considered.”  U.K. lawmakers are reviewing professional standards in the
banking industry after Barclays, the U.K.’s second-largest bank
by assets, was fined 290 million pounds ($470.8 million) in June
for its role in rigging the London interbank offered rate, known
as Libor, for profit. Martin Wheatley, the U.K’s chief markets
regulator, is scheduled to publish a report on a regulatory
overhaul of Libor on Sept. 28.  The FSA also asked for powers to review the conduct of
lower-ranking financial employees who don’t otherwise need FSA
approval.  “A banking sector which functions well for consumers and
the economy as a whole cannot be achieved unless employees below
the level of senior management also act with honesty and
integrity,” the agency said.  The regulator will be split into the Prudential Regulation
Authority, which will become a unit of the  Bank of England , and
the Financial Conduct Authority, in 2013.
