Crude options volatility fell for a
second day as futures rose on optimism that central bank
stimulus will revive the global economy and boost demand.  Implied volatility for options expiring in November, a

4:04 p.m. with 3,035 lots trading. December $120 calls were the
second-most traded, with 2,465 lots changing hands as they fell
1 cent to 27 cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would fall accounted for 60 percent of the
