Germany ’s main opposition  Social
Democratic Party  denied a report in Cicero magazine that the SPD
leadership has decided to field  Peer Steinbrueck  against
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  in next year’s federal election.  Fellow SPD leaders Sigmar Gabriel and Frank-Walter Steinmeier see Steinbrueck, the finance minister in Merkel’s
first-term coalition with the Social Democrats, as having the
best chance of defeating Merkel, Cicero reported today, citing
party members it didn’t name. The SPD will announce
Steinbrueck’s candidacy before Christmas, the magazine said.  “That’s nonsense,” SPD spokesman Tobias Duenow said in an
e-mail when asked to comment on the report.  The SPD, which governed with the Greens under Chancellor
 Gerhard Schroeder  from 1998 to 2005 before serving in a so-
called grand coalition with Merkel’s CDU/CSU for the next four
years, trails the chancellor’s party by 7-12 percentage points
in opinion polls one year out from the election.  Merkel is more popular than any of the three SPD leaders,
with a Forsa poll for Stern released on Sept. 19 suggesting that
she would trounce all three contenders if voters could elect the
chancellor directly. Merkel “seems unbeatable right now,”
Stern said.  Even so, the current weakness of Merkel’s Free Democratic
coalition partner since 2009 threatens to force her into another
coalition with the SPD after the election. Steinbrueck will aim
to dispel the notion that a grand coalition is the only possible
outcome of the election due in the fall of 2013, Cicero said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
