Google Inc., the world’s largest
Internet search engine and maker of the Android operating system
for mobile devices, was sued by Skyhook Wireless Inc. for
infringing nine patents for global positioning detection.  The lawsuit targets location-identification technology
including “ Google Maps ” used by Google customers in products
such as tablet computers, according to a complaint filed by
Boston-based Skyhook yesterday in federal court in Delaware.  Mountain View , California-based Google is using the
inventions “without authority or license from Skyhook,” and
should pay damages after a  jury trial , according to court
papers. Skyhook also seeks an injunction against further
infringement by Google.  “We believe these claims are baseless and we intend to
defend vigorously against them,” Niki Fenwick, a company
spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement.  Location-tracking technology, which can pinpoint a person’s
whereabouts, help advertisers tailor marketing messages to
mobile-device users. Closely held Skyhook pioneered tracking a
smartphone’s location by measuring its proximity to Wi-Fi
hotspots instead of relying on global-positioning satellites or
cell towers.  The case is Skyhook Wireless Inc. v.  Google Inc. (GOOG) , 12-1177,
U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
