The Czech government banned exports
of beverages with more than 20 percent alcohol content after
spirits laced with methyl-alcohol killed people across the
country,  Pravo  reported, citing Health Minister Leos Heger.  At least 23 people died in the past three weeks after
consuming tainted drinks in the worst case of mass alcohol
poisoning in 30 years, the newspaper said. The government last
week also imposed a nationwide ban on hard-liquor sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
