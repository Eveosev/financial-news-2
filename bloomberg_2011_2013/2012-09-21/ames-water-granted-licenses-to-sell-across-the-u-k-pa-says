Thames Water, the U.K.’s largest
water supplier, has been granted licenses to sell to businesses
throughout  England ,  Wales  and  Scotland , the Press Association
reported, citing the company’s commercial services director.  The entry of Kemble Water Holdings Ltd.’s Thames Water
unit, which serves 14 million mainly residential customers in
London and other parts of the Home Counties, means the private
company may plan to target high-use businesses in England and
Wales such as breweries and industry, competing on price to take
revenue from water suppliers elsewhere in the U.K., PA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
