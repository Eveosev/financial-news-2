Aegon NV, the Dutch owner of U.S.
insurer Transamerica Corp., had its credit outlook cut to
negative from stable by  Fitch Ratings  because of the 32 percent
leverage ratio at the company.  The ratings may be downgraded “if financial leverage does
not improve to below 30%,” the ratings firm said today in a
statement about the Hague-based insurer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
