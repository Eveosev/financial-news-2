Romania ’s euro-denominated bond
yields fell for the first time in a week on optimism Europe may
resolve its debt crisis, boosting appetite for riskier assets,
and the country raised more debt than planned this month.  Yields on Romania’s bonds denominated in euros and due 2018
declined five basis points, or 0.05 percentage points, for the
first time since Sept. 14, to 4.785 percent by 5 p.m. in
Bucharest today from 4.832 percent yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Bank of Japan (8301)  joined the  Federal Reserve  and the
 European Central Bank  this week in pledging to add economic
stimulus to boost growth. The Financial Times reported that
Spanish and European Union officials are working on plans to
trigger ECB bond purchases. Romania  raised  4.54 billion lei
($1.3 billion) this month, compared with a plan of 3.3 billion
lei, the biggest amount of debt sold on the domestic market
since April when it raised 4.67 billion lei.  “The calmer domestic scenery and the more generous
liquidity conditions, set against a favorable external backdrop,
have recently been supportive of Finance Ministry debt
tenders,” Roxana Hulea, a Bucharest-based analyst at  BRD-Groupe
Societe Generale SA (BRD) , wrote in a note to clients today. “Debt
managers have taken advantage of a more solid demand and softer
yields and overshot the planned issuance calendar, heavily
skewed towards short maturities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
