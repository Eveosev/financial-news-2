The  National Football League  warned
its 32 teams that disrespectful confrontations with the
substitute officials currently working regular-season games
won’t be tolerated, according to NFL.com.  With the NFL Referees Association locked out, several
senior NFL administrators made phone calls yesterday to team
owners, general managers and coaches to “send a message that
everyone has a responsibility on respect for the game,” NFL
Executive Vice President  Ray Anderson  said, according to the
league’s  website .  The warnings came after a game between the Atlanta Falcons
and Denver Broncos on Sept. 17 was slowed by officiating issues,
during which players and coaches, such as the Broncos’ John Fox,
were seen berating the officials.  “The events of Monday evening, in the first half of that
game, represented unacceptable behavior,” Anderson said,
according to NFL.com. “We’re not going to tolerate it.”  Greg Aiello , a spokesman for the NFL, declined to comment
on the warnings in an e-mail. Corry Rush, another league
spokesman, said in an e-mail that he had no information on the
possibility of a fine for Fox.  To contact the reporter on this story:
