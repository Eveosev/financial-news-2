All Nippon Airways Co. (9202) , Asia’s largest listed carrier by sales, agreed to purchase 11 more  Boeing Co. (BA)  787-9 aircraft to expand its fleet as it adds international routes.  The planes are valued at 254.7 billion yen ($3.3 billion) at list prices for delivery in the fiscal year 2018 to fiscal 2021, the carrier said today in a statement. ANA declined to comment on how much it will pay for the aircraft, according to Ryosei Nomura, a spokesman.  All Nippon, the first to fly the 787 Dreamliner commercially, announced the purchases two months after  selling  about 182 billion yen in new shares, including overallotment, to finance fleet expansion. The  airline  has said it is benefitting from the introduction of fuel-efficient Boeing 787s on flights to  Frankfurt  in January and on domestic routes.  The airline plans to switch its Narita to Seattle service to 787 aircraft from Oct. 1, and make a switch to 787s for flights between Tokyo Haneda and Beijing from Oct. 28. It plans to add services from Tokyo Narita to  San Jose ,  California , starting January with the 787, according to the statement.  When added with existing orders, the purchases announced today will bring ANA’s Dreamliner fleet to 36 B787-8 aircraft and 30 B787-9 versions. The  company  had initially ordered 55 of the planes, 13 of which have been delivered, according to today’s statement.  ANA is the largest airline customer for the 787 and second overall after ILFC Holdings Inc., which has 74 orders, according to Boeing’s website.  Five of ANA’s Dreamliners were temporarily grounded in July because of faulty engine parts and have returned to service.
