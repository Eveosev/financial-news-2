Repower Systems SE, the German unit
of India’s biggest wind-turbine maker  Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , will
supply 45 megawatts of turbines to a Polish project developed by
WSB Neue Energien GmbH.  The turbines, each with a 2.05-megawatt capacity, will be
installed at the Taczalin project in Lower Silesia province,
Pune-based Suzlon said today in a statement, without disclosing
terms.  The wind farm will be completed in August next year. WSB, a
Dresden, Germany-based renewable-energy developer, commissioned
its first wind park in  Poland  last year near Opole, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
