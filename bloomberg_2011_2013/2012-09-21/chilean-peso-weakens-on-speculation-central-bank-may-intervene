Chile’s peso fell for the first
time in three days, posting a weekly decline, on speculation the
central bank may buy dollars to weaken the local currency.  The peso depreciated 0.6 percent to 473.35 per dollar. The
currency also posted a 0.6 percent decline since Sept. 14.
Chilean markets were closed Sept. 17-19.  “At the end of the day no one wants to go home short
dollars,” said Rodrigo Arteche, a trader at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch in Santiago.  This year’s 9.8 percent really in the peso makes it the
best-performing major currency in  Latin America . Twice in the
past five years the central bank undertook programs to buy
dollars after coming under pressure from politicians and
exporters to slow the appreciation of the peso. Speculation that
the bank would intervene again increased last month after the
real  exchange rate , which is adjusted for inflation, reached the
strongest level since December 2010.  The currency has rallied 1.6 percent in the two weeks since
Chilean central bank President Rodrigo Vergara said it was in
line with economic fundamentals and on Sept. 14 reached 467 per
dollar, the highest in a year.  Data published today by the central bank show that
international investors in the forwards market cut short peso
positions by $1.6 billion to $8.6 billion on Sept. 14, before
the three-day market holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
