Arik Airlines Ltd. ,  Nigeria ’s
largest flight operator, halted domestic flights for a second
day after a union under the West Africa nation’s airports
authority stopped its planes from flying yesterday in Lagos, the
commercial capital.  Arik Airline must pay the 18 billion naira ($114 million)
for the use of airport facilities it owes,  Federal Airports
Authority of Nigeria  Director-General George Uriesi said on
state-owned Radio Nigeria.  “I pay every time I fly, why won’t they pay for my
services?” he said. “They cannot continue to operate on a
model that they won’t pay us.”  The airline, which operates  23 aircraft , flies at least
three times weekly to  London  and  New York . Its international
operations aren’t affected by the suspension, Arik Air said in
an e-mailed statement yesterday.  The Lagos-based airline appealed to the government for
“urgent intervention” so it can resume its domestic
operations. Passengers will be re-booked on other flights when
operations resume, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
