The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars is heading for the first weekly increase since
July, according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 22 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:15 a.m. in
 London  compared with minus 17 on Sept. 14, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The cost reached a 14-month low of 15.1
at the end of last week.  The one-year basis swap was 25 basis points, or 0.25
percentage point, below Euribor from minus 26.5 yesterday.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another held at the lowest since March 2011. The
difference between Euribor and overnight index swaps, the
Euribor-OIS spread, was little changed at 15 basis points.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.097
percent yesterday from 0.09 percent the day before. The Eonia
swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing costs over the
next three months, was unchanged at 7.6 basis points.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the European
Central Bank yesterday, placing 302 billion euros ($392 billion)
with the Frankfurt-based central bank from 299 billion euros the
day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
