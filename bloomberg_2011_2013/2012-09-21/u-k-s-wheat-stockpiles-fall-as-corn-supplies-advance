U.K. wheat inventories as of June
30 were 2.7 percent lower than a year earlier, in part as on-
farm supplies fell in England and  Wales , the Agriculture and
Horticulture Development Board said. Corn supplies rose.  The country’s stockpiles were 1.495 million metric tons, or
about 31,000 tons less than estimated in May, and less than
supplies of 1.537 million tons a year earlier, AHDB’s grain
unit, the Home-Grown Cereals Authority, said in a  report  on its
website dated yesterday. Figures represent the final estimates
for the 2011-12 season.  The U.K. exported 2.545 million tons of wheat during
2011-12, compared with imports of 908,000 tons, AHDB said.
Figures are higher than previously reported because of “a
recently identified coding error,” it said. Total wheat use was
pegged at 13.662 million tons, 57,000 tons below the May
forecast because of lower demand for the grain in livestock
feed. Production was 15.257 million tons, unchanged from the May
forecast and more than the 14.878 million harvested a year
earlier.  Barley inventories as of June 30 were 940,000 tons, about
70,000 tons more than at the end of the previous season, AHDB
said. Exports of the grain amounted to 804,000 tons and imports
were 156,000 tons.  U.K. stockpiles of corn were 149,000 tons, or 38,000 tons
more than a year earlier, according to the report. Imports rose
to 1.102 million tons, up 142,000 tons from the May forecast,
because of increasing livestock demand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
