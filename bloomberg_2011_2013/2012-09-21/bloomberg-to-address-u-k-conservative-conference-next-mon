New York Mayor  Michael Bloomberg 
will address Britain’s Conservative Party conference next month,
said his press secretary,  Marc LaVorgna .  Bloomberg’s appearance at the conference, scheduled to open
in Birmingham, central England, on Oct. 7, was first reported in
the  Daily Telegraph . LaVorgna declined to confirm the
newspaper’s description of Bloomberg as the keynote speaker, or
its assertion based on unnamed sources that Bloomberg intends to
endorse the government’s austerity plans.  Bloomberg, 70, elected to a third and final four-year term
in 2009, owns a house in London, and five years ago spoke to the
2007 Tory conference in Blackpool. In New York, the most
populous U.S. city with 8.2 million residents, he manages a
budget of about $70 billion and has made recurring budget cuts
to trim deficits 12 times during the past six years. He also
raised property taxes more than 18 percent in 2002 during a
recession exacerbated by the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.  In July 2010, Bloomberg hosted British Prime Minister  David Cameron  on a walk through the city and stopped to grab a hotdog
from a street-vendor. When London Mayor  Boris Johnson  visited
the city in June he described himself as a “a big fan” of
Bloomberg during a television appearance on CBS network’s
“David Letterman Show.”  The New York mayor is founder and majority owner of
Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporters on this story:
