The Philippine peso and Malaysia’s
ringgit led declines in Asian currencies this week after data
from the U.S.,  Europe  and  China  reinforced concern the global
economic slowdown is deepening.  More Americans than forecast filed claims for  unemployment
benefits , according to data released Sept. 20, while a Chinese
manufacturing survey signaled an 11th month of contraction. A
gauge of euro-area services and production fell to a 39-month
low, another report showed.  Bank of Japan (8301)  expanded its asset-
purchase fund this week by 10 trillion yen ($128 billion), after
the  Federal Reserve  and the  European Central Bank  announced
steps this month that would pump money into financial markets.  “There is concern about the global economic outlook and
that’s keeping investors somewhat cautious,” said Kozo Hasegawa,
a Bangkok-based foreign-exchange trader at Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking Corp. “Still, with quantitative easing by the Fed,
there’s optimism about more fund inflows to the region, making
the currencies range-bound in recent sessions.”  Malaysia ’s ringgit declined 0.6 percent this week to 3.0505
per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Philippine peso also lost 0.6 percent to 41.665, while
Indonesia’s rupiah slid 0.5 percent to 9,551. Thailand’s baht
fell 0.2 percent to 30.82.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-active currencies outside of Japan, was steady
at 116.98 compared with 116.93 at the end of last week, while
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares lost 0.1 percent.  China Data  The ringgit had its first weekly drop this month after the
manufacturing report from China, the second-largest buyer of
Malaysian goods in July, dimmed the nation’s export outlook. It
gained 0.5 percent yesterday.  “In the current circumstances, the Chinese data aren’t too
helpful for risk assets,” said  Sacha Tihanyi , a Hong Kong-based
senior currency strategist at Scotiabank. “The same holds for
Europe.”  The rupiah completed its biggest weekly loss this month on
speculation importers stepped up dollar purchases after the
Fed’s latest asset-buying plan drove the Indonesian currency to
a seven-week high.  The U.S. central bank announced on Sept. 13 that it will
start purchasing $40 billion of mortgage debt a month to hold
borrowing costs down, a policy known as quantitative easing that
boosts the supply of dollars. The rupiah touched 9,447 versus
the greenback on Sept. 17, the strongest level since Aug. 1,
before declining on each of the following four days.  QE Effect Recedes  “The rupiah halted its rally as the QE effect recedes,”
said Putu Andi Wijaya, a foreign-exchange dealer at PT Bank
Rakyat  Indonesia  in Jakarta. “Corporates take any opportunity
to buy dollars whenever the rupiah reaches a good level.”  The currency lost 5 percent this year, Asia’s biggest
decline, amid concern Southeast Asia’s largest economy will have
a record  current-account  deficit this year. The shortfall in the
broadest measure of trade widened to an unprecedented $6.9
billion in the second quarter from $3.2 billion in the previous
three months.  India’s rupee surged to the highest level in more than four
months as the government reduced a tax on local companies’
overseas borrowings, stepping up efforts to revive investment
inflows.  India Tax Cut  A tax on interest earned by overseas investors in foreign-
currency bonds issued by Indian companies, and on interest
payments for overseas loans, was reduced to 5 percent from 20
percent, the  Finance Ministry  said in a statement in New Delhi
yesterday. The cut will be applicable for three years, effective
July 1, 2012, according to the statement.  The rupee advanced 1.7 percent to 53.4650 per dollar
yesterday in Mumbai, taking this week’s gain to 1.6 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 53.3388
earlier, the strongest level since May 10.  Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea’s won declined 0.2 percent
this week to 1,119.23 per dollar, China’s  yuan  appreciated 0.15
percent to 6.3053, while Taiwan’s dollar rose 0.1 percent to
NT$29.450. Vietnam’s dong traded at 20,870 compared with 20,850
a week ago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
