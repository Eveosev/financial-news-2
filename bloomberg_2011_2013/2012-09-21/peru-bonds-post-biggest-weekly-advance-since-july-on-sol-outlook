Peru ’s sol-denominated bonds posted
the biggest weekly advance in two months as rising metal prices
boosted the outlook for the Andean nation’s currency.  The yield on the benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 fell 19 basis points, or 0.19 percentage
point, to 4.19 percent this week. It fell two basis points
today. The price rose 0.13 centimo to 124.11 centimos per sol.  The sol strengthened today for the first time in a week as
copper climbed on speculation European officials will unveil a
bailout plan for  Spain  as early as next week, easing concern
that metal demand will slow. Gold also rose. Metals, led by
copper and gold, account for about two-thirds of Peru’s exports.  “Investors are buying bonds in the short end of the curve
purely as a play on the currency,” said Alberto Jabiles, a
trader at  BBVA Banco Continental  in  Lima . “High commodity
prices are going to help the economy and represent real export
flows. Investment also remains strong, which means more dollar
inflows.”  The sol appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.5990 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 2.6025 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local
unit. The currency weakened less than 0.2 percent this week
after touching 2.5950 on Sept. 14, the strongest level since
1997,  data  from Peru’s financial regulator show.  Peru’s central bank bought $20 million in the spot currency
market today and paid an average 2.6005 soles per U.S. dollar,
it said on its website.  Banks are betting the sol will strengthen “in the coming
months” as demand for local bonds increases and companies bring
in dollars for investment, Fernando Palma, a strategist at  Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria , wrote in a note to clients yesterday.
The currency will likely appreciate to 2.58 by Dec. 31, and 2.5
by the end of next year, he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
