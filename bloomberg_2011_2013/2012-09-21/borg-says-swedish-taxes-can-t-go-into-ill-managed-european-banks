Swedish Finance Minister  Anders Borg  said his government will never agree to let taxpayers in
the largest Nordic economy bail out “ill-managed” banks
elsewhere in  Europe .  In his latest attack against Europe’s proposed banking
union, Borg called the basic structure proposed for a common
European banking framework “unreasonable,” arguing that Sweden
won’t accept a model that gives euro members more clout than
European Union states outside the currency bloc.  “The European Banking Authority, the  European Central Bank 
would automatically get a majority,” Borg said in an interview
in  Stockholm  yesterday. “This entire regulatory framework that
we’ve built up in the last few years is based on that when
different countries get into a conflict, different banks get
into a conflict, there will be mediation. You can’t leave that
to an institution where the ECB and the euro countries have an
automatic majority.”  Sweden , which wants to impose stricter capital standards on
its banks after the industry’s expansion into the Baltic States
triggered losses in 2008 and 2009, won’t accept EU rules that
hamper those regulatory goals, Borg said.  “We’ve worked hard to raise capital coverage requirements
on Swedish banks,” Borg said. “We’re not prepared, through the
back door, to allow the French and others who were skeptical of
this to undermine that deal and decide that it’s only the ECB
that can decide capital coverage requirements.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
