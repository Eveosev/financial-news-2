Croatia’s government  will dismiss
20,000 people in the public sector in an effort to cut costs and
stick to its budget plans, Finance Minister Slavko Linic said.  “We have to start reducing the number of employees as
there is no more room for lowering salaries,” Linic told state
TV late yesterday.  Croatia , set to become the EU’s 28th member next July, is
struggling with a recession that’s gripping the Balkans because
of Europe’s debt crisis. Prime Minister  Zoran Milanovic  wants to
reduce the former Yugoslav republic’s spending by 4 billion kuna
($700 million) by lowering subsidies to state companies and
cutting public wages as it integrates with the west.  The government on Sept. 17 said it is canceling collective
job contracts stipulating benefits for public workers to the
year-end after negotiations with unions broke down over cuts
proposed by the Cabinet.  The  World Bank ,  Fitch Ratings  and other credit-rating
companies have urged the government to press on with a reduction
of the bloated public sector and revamp collective contracts
that give vast benefits to public workers.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story: Jasmina
