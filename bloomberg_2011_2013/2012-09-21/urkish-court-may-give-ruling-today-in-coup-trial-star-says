A Turkish court may give a ruling
today in the trial of 365 defendants, most of whom are active or
retired military officers, on charges of plotting to overthrow
the Islamic-rooted government in 2003, Star newspaper said.  The so-called “Balyoz” or “Sledgehammer” trial began in
December 2010. Hundreds of other suspects, including soldiers
and politicians, face similar charges in a separate case, dubbed
“Ergenekon,” investigating an alleged conspiracy aimed at
overthrowing the government of Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan , which came to power in November 2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
