Citigroup Inc. (C)  will pay $525,000 to
resolve U.S. regulatory claims that the Wall Street bank’s
traders exceeded limits on speculation in wheat futures.  Traders with Citigroup units in December 2009 held bullish
positions on the Chicago Board of Trade that exceeded so-called
position limits intended to curb excessive speculation, the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in an  order  released
today. The trades were used to hedge customers’ transactions in
the over-the-counter swap market, the agency said.  “We are pleased to resolve this matter and look forward to
putting this behind us,” Scott Helfman, a Citigroup spokesman,
said in an e-mail statement. The trades were conducted at
subsidiaries including Citigroup Global Markets Limited, a
London-based investment banking arm.  New curbs on oil, natural gas, wheat and other trades
imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act begin to take effect on Oct.
12. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc. and
Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association filed a
lawsuit in December seeking to overturn the limits, arguing that
the agency didn’t demonstrate that they were required by the
2010 financial-regulation law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
