The MF Global Holdings Ltd. trustee
sued Breakwater Trading for allegedly breaching a credit
agreement and seeks about $8.3 million plus interest, according
to a court filing.  On Sept. 14, written demand was sent to Breakwater pursuant
to the agreement, MF Global’s Chapter 11 trustee,  Louis Freeh ,
said in court papers filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. “Breakwater, however, has refused to comply with its
clear contractual obligation to repay the money it borrowed,”
Freeh said.  MF Global Holdings, once run by former New Jersey Governor
and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  Co-Chairman Jon Corzine, filed the
eighth-largest U.S. bankruptcy after a wrong-way $6.3 billion
trade on its own behalf on bonds of some of Europe’s most
indebted nations.  MF Global Holdings’ Oct. 31 bankruptcy filing listed assets
of $41 billion and debt of $39.7 billion.  The parent’s bankruptcy case is MF Global Holdings Ltd.,
11-bk-15059, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
