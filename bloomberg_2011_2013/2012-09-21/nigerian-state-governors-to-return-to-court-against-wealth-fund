The governors of  Nigeria ’s 36
states will go ahead with their law suit challenging the legal
standing of the country’s $1 billion sovereign wealth fund.  The operation of the fund by the federal government
violates a constitutional provision that all government revenue
must be shared among that states and the center, the governors
said in a joint statement e-mailed today.  The governors had given their approval in June for the
appointment of a board and management for the Nigerian Sovereign
Wealth Investment Authority and the initial withdrawal of $1
billion to start the fund. They made no comment at the time on
the status of the suit pending before the  Supreme Court 
challenging the sovereign wealth-fund law.  The Nigerian Governors’ Forum “unanimously decided to head
back to court to enforce” the federal government’s  “adherence
to the constitution,” according to their statement.  Nigeria’s sovereign wealth law requires the creation of
funds for infrastructure, future generation and budget
stabilization, with each representing at least 20 percent of the
total. Savings through the fund will enable Africa’s top oil
producer to build its infrastructure and provide a buffer
against volatility in  oil prices , Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo- Iweala said on Aug. 28.  The West African country relies on crude exports for about
95 percent of its foreign-currency earnings and about 80 percent
of government revenue, according to the  Finance Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
