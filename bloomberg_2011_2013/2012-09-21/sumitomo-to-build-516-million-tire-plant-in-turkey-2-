Japan ’s  Sumitomo Rubber Industries
Ltd. (5110) , which sells its products under the Dunlop brand, signed a
deal with Petlas Lastik Sanayi ve Ticaret AS to build a tire
factory in  Turkey .  Sumitomo, Japan’s third-largest tiremaker, and Petlas will
invest $516 million in the factory in Cankiri, north of Ankara,
said Ilker Ayci, chairman of the country’s Investment Support &
Promotion Agency.  “The priority of our factory in Cankiri is to supply tires
for Japanese automobile firms such as Toyota and Honda and
become a base for the European market,” Ikuji Ikeda, chief
executive officer of Sumitomo, told reporters in Ankara.  The factory will start producing tires for cars and trucks
in June 2015 and reach an annual capacity of 10 million tires by
2017, Ikeda said. “We expect a serious growth primarily in
 Russia  and the Middle East markets,” Ikeda said.  Turkish Economy Minister Zafer Caglayan said Sumitomo will
use the factory to produce tires for 56 countries. He also said
that Turkey is preparing to start negotiations on a trade
agreement with Japan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
