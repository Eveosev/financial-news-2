Rory McIlroy put his Northern
Ireland home on sale for 2 million pounds ($3.26 million),
complete with four golfing greens, a driving range, limestone
floors and five en-suite bedrooms.  The 23-year-old U.S PGA winner’s two-story  house , 10 miles
(16 kilometers) southeast of  Belfast , is about 6,000 square feet
(557 square meters) including five reception rooms and a tennis
court. McIlroy put the property on the market because he spends
more time in the U.S., said selling agent Michael Rodgers.  “It is very bright, the finish is beautiful with limestone
floors, white oak floors, it is the very best of fittings,”
Rodgers said in a phone interview today. “He is spending a lot
of time in America, he doesn’t have time for it anymore.” The
house went on sale this week and Rogers has already received
“strong enquires,” he said.  McIlroy, who bought the property in 2009, won the  U.S. Open 
in 2011 and the U.S. PGA last month, bolstering his position at
No. 1 in the rankings. Since buying the house, he added the
greens, which Rogers says are laid with grass consistent with
both the U.S. and European professional courses.  “I have really enjoyed living here,” McIlroy says on the
website advertising the house for sale in Moneyreagh, County
Down. “The house has always been busy with friends and family
and has suited us on all occasions.”  McIlroy’s management agents, Horizon Sports Events, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment about the
listing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
