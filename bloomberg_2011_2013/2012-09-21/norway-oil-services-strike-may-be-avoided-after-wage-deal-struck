Oil-service workers and employers
in  Norway  said they reached a wage agreement that could avoid a
strike in Western Europe’s largest oil and gas producer if union
members approve the terms of the deal.  The parties agreed to a general pay raise of 4.5 percent as
well as other increases for as many as 5,800 workers, Norwegian
Oil and Gas, which represents employers, said in a statement
today. Oil service workers affiliated with the Industry Energy
union will vote on the draft deal “within four weeks,” its
chief negotiator, Leif Sande, said in a telephone interview.  “It’s a good deal from an economic point of view, but less
so on working shifts,” Sande said, declining to say whether he
would advise his members to vote for or against the agreement.  Sande had previously said there was a “high risk” of a
strike by about 360 workers at companies including  Halliburton
Co. (HAL)  and  Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)  The parties were due to meet for
government-led mediation on Oct. 1 and Oct. 2 after talks broke
down last month.  An oil-worker strike over pensions at the end of June and
at the beginning of July disrupted 15 percent of Norway’s oil
production and 7 percent of gas output, according to figures
from Norwegian Oil and Gas. The conflict was ended by the
government through forced arbitration as a total shutdown
loomed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
