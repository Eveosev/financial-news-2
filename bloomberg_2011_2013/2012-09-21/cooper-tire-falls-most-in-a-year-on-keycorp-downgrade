Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. (CTB) , a U.S.
tiremaker, tumbled the most in more than a year after KeyCorp
downgraded the stock to hold from buy, citing possible
industrywide price volatility when tariffs on Chinese tires
expire.  Cooper  fell  8.7 percent to $20.07 at 12:01 p.m. after
declining as much as 9.7 percent for the biggest intraday drop
since Aug. 18, 2011. The Findlay, Ohio-based company, up 57
percent this year through yesterday, was  among  the biggest
decliners in the  Russell 2000 Index. (RTY)   A U.S. tariff on Chinese tires, set to expire on Sept. 26,
could weigh on stocks of U.S. manufacturers as rivals in the
Asian nation cut prices on the low-end of the market by 10
percent to 15 percent, Brett D. Hoselton, a  KeyCorp (KEY)  analyst,
wrote in an investor note yesterday.  “Cooper Tire can lower pricing on its opening pricing-
point tires by 10 percent to 15 percent with no impact on
operating income,” Hoselton wrote. The company’s “other
products are potentially at risk of declining as well, driven by
the lower end of the market creating a significant pricing gap
relative to higher tiered products.”  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (GT)  fell 3 percent to $12.98, after
earlier dropping as much as 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
