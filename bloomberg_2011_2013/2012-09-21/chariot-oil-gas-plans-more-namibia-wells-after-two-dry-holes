Chariot Oil & Gas Ltd. (CHAR) , a U.K.
energy explorer focused on  Namibia , plans more drilling in the
southern African country next year after failing to make a
commercial find with two exploration wells in six months.  “We have multiple future targets for drilling in different
geographic locations targeting different geological play types,
as well as the opportunity to add new assets to our portfolio,”
Chief Executive Officer Paul Welch said today in a statement.
“Despite the recent well results being disappointing, we are
still in control of our next steps.”  Chariot has lost 85 percent of its market value since March
as it failed to make an oil or gas discovery at its Tapir South
or Nimrod prospects. The Guernsey, Channel Islands-based company
is debt-free and had a cash balance of $112.4 million at the end
of June, allowing it to drill two more wells in 2013.  Namibia has attracted attention from the world’s biggest
oil companies, with  BP Plc (BP/)  and  Repsol SA (REP)  snapping up assets in
the past year on a bet that its coastal shelf may mirror that of
 Brazil  across the Atlantic Ocean, where the Tupi discovery in
2007 was the Americas’ biggest offshore find in three decades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
