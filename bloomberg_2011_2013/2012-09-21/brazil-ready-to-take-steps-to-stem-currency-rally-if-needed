Brazil’s government may impose
taxes on financial operations to respond to any speculative
inflows of foreign capital, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said.  The U.S. Federal Reserve’s new round of monetary easing,
known as QE3, has stimulated the “currency war,” Mantega said
at an event in London. “If there is a great inflow of American
currency, we will either have to increase our reserves or
intervene in markets,” he said. If necessary, “we will adopt
measures of taxing financial operations,” he added.  “The currency war is a reality that is used by various
countries,” Mantega said. The government will not permit a loss
of competitiveness, he said.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration in recent months
has cut borrowing costs, lowered taxes on company payrolls and
 consumer goods  and reduced bank reserve requirements to spur the
economy after a yearlong slowdown. Since the U.S. Fed announced
QE3 last week, Brazil’s central bank has intervened repeatedly
in  currency markets  to weaken the real and protect the
competitiveness of Brazilian industry. Earlier this month,
Brazil also boosted tariffs on 100 products.  It is not correct to say that Brazil is protectionist,
Mantega said. “It is very natural that companies defend
themselves from the actions that do not necessarily bring them
direct economic benefit,” he said.  Interest rates  in Brazil will continue to be low, and the
government has room for more rate cuts, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
