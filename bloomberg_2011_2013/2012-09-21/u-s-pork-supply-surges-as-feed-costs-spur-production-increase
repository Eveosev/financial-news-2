Pork inventories in the U.S. rose
31 percent to a record at the end of August from a year earlier,
the government said, as farmers culled herds because of high
feed costs, pushing meat production to a record.  Warehouses held 580.8 million pounds of pork, up from 442.9
million on Aug. 31, 2011, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said today in a report. The figure was the highest ever for the
date, the USDA said. Inventories rose 5.7 percent from the end
of July.  U.S. commercial pork  output  in the first eight months of
2012 totaled 15.1 billion pounds (6.85 million metric tons), up
3.3 percent from the same period a year earlier, government data
show. Pork production last month rose to a record 2 billion
pounds, up 16 percent from July and 5.6 percent higher than
August 2011, USDA data show. The price of corn, the main
ingredient in livestock feed, is up 48 percent since June 15 as
the worst U.S. drought since 1956 erodes yields.  “There’s no doubt the high grain did cause higher
liquidation,”  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities
Inc., said in a telephone interview from  West Des Moines ,  Iowa .
“We’ve had bigger supplies, and consumption in general was down
a little bit.”  Hog futures for December settlement rose 0.7 percent to
74.7 cents a pound at 10:40 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices were down 12 percent this year through
yesterday.  Wholesale  pork  prices slumped 11 percent in August, the
biggest monthly slide since October 2010.  As of Aug. 31, stockpiles of  pork bellies , which are cured
and sliced to make bacon, fell 9.2 percent from a year earlier
to 13.8 million pounds, according to today’s report. Warehouse
supplies of ham climbed 30 percent to 195 million pounds.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of August were 5.6
percent smaller than a year earlier at 655.3 million pounds, the
USDA said. Beef supplies rose 0.3 percent to 429.8 million
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
