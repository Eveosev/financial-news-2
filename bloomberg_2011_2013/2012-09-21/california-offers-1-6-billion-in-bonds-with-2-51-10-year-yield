California began selling $1.55
billion of tax-exempt bonds with a preliminary yield of 2.51
percent on securities maturing in 2022.  The bonds offer 0.73 percentage point more yield than top-
rated debt maturing in  10 years , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s down from 0.84 percentage point on bonds with
similar maturities sold in April. Thirty-year bonds were offered
at 3.75 percent, or 0.86  percentage point  above AAA securities.  Treasurer Bill Lockyer is selling $1 billion of general
obligations for public-works projects and $550 million to refund
debt. Orders are being taken from individual investors today and
Sept. 24 before institutions such as mutual funds get their
chance on Sept 25, the last day of the sale.  With another $500 million slated for market in October,
Lockyer plans to offer about $5.3 billion this year, about a
quarter of the state’s sales in 2009.  California’s economy is bigger than  India ’s, ranking ninth
in the world as measured by gross domestic product, according to
the state Finance Department. Its bonds have returned 6.6
percent in 2012, beating all but three states and the 5.7
percent gain for the broader $3.7 trillion muni market,
according to Standard & Poor’s data.  S&P rates California A-, its seventh-lowest investment
level and the worst grade it gives any state.  The  yield  on benchmark tax-free debt due in 10 years was
1.78 percent, according to a Bloomberg Valuation index. The
 interest rate  set a record low of 1.63 percent in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
