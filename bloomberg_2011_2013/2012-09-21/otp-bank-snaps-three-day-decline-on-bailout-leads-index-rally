OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, gained for the first time in four days, after a report
said European officials are discussing a Spanish bailout.  The shares rose 0.7 percent to 3,866 forint by the close in
Budapest, paring their decline this week to 5.4 percent. The
benchmark BUX stock  index  dropped 0.3 percent to 18,637.15,
retreating for a fifth day.  European stocks climbed after the Financial Times reported
Spain will next week unveil an economic reform program that will
allow the indebted country to seek a bailout. Hungary, the
European Union’s most indebted eastern member, has also sought
an aid deal from the EU and the  International Monetary Fund  for
10 months.  “There is a positive mood on global markets, which may be
helping to stop the decline in the domestic market,” Budapest-
based broker Quaestor Zrt. wrote in a report on its website
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
