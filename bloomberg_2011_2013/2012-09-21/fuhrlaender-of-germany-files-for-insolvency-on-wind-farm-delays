Fuhrlaender AG , a German maker of
 wind turbines , filed for insolvency at a Rhineland court, citing
delayed projects and postponed payments from customers.  Fuhrlaender, which filed papers at Montabaur’s district
court, had cut 70 staff and started a restructuring this year to
focus on its “core” units, the company said in a  statement 
today. It will take “all necessary steps” to keep operating
and has already reached agreements with major partners, it said.  Competition from Chinese manufacturers has dragged down
prices for wind turbines, while  Europe ’s economic slowdown has
tightened credit markets, curbing funds for project development.
Fuhrlaender, which won investment from a Ukrainian group as
recently as May, was hurt by a delay in payments, it said today.  “Financing both takes longer and is more difficult to
secure, so projects are being delayed,” said Eduardo Tabbush,
an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “Manufacturers have
also been hit by falling demand and prices, so if you don’t have
the scale or the technology it is difficult to compete.”  Turbine prices fell about 8 percent to about 939,700 euros
($1.2 million) a megawatt last year, according to New Energy
Finance data.  Fuhrlaender, a Liebenscheid-based company set up in 1960
and now with 430 employees, produces a range of turbines
including 2-megawatt and 3-megawatt machines.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
