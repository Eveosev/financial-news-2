Peru ’s sol-denominated bonds headed
for their biggest weekly advance in two months as rising metal
prices boosted the outlook for the Andean nation’s currency.  The yield on the benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 4.19 percent at 12:24 p.m. in  Lima , according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.20 centimo to
124.17 centimos per sol. The yield has dropped 19 basis points
this week.  The sol strengthened today for the first time in a week as
copper climbed on speculation European officials will unveil a
bailout plan for  Spain  as early as next week, easing concern
that metal demand will slow. Gold and silver also rose. Metals,
led by copper and gold, account for about two-thirds of Peru’s
exports.  “Investors are buying bonds in the short end of the curve
purely as a play on the currency,” said Alberto Jabiles, a
trader at  BBVA Banco Continental  in Lima. “High commodity
prices are going to help the economy and represent real export
flows. Investment also remains strong, which means more dollar
inflows.”  The sol appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.6 per  U.S. dollar ,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. The currency has
weakened 0.2 percent this week after touching 2.5950 on Sept.
14, the strongest level since 1997,  data  from Peru’s financial
regulator show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
