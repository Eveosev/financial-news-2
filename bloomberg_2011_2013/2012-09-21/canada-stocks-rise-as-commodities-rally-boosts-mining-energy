Canadian  stocks  erased gains in the
last hour of trading as a plunge in  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) 
overshadowed gains in energy and mining shares.  RIM plunged 7.4 percent after BlackBerry service was
disrupted for some users outside of  North America .  Sun Life
Financial Inc. (SLF)  and  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC)  fell at least 0.8
percent.  Niko Resources Ltd. (NKO) , which explores for oil and gas,
surged 17 percent.  San Gold (SGR)  Corp. added 3.9 percent.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  lost 25.65
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,383.60 in Toronto. The benchmark
equity gauge slumped 0.9 percent for the week.  “People don’t want to hold risk into the weekend,” said
Brian Huen, managing partner with Red Sky Capital Management
Ltd. in Toronto. His firm manages about C$55 million ($56.4
million). “ Spain  is potentially asking for aid, but until that
actually happens it’s speculation. You won’t put both feet in
the water unless you know that’s what’s going to happen.”  Seven of 10 industries in the S&P/TSX declined. Trading
volume was 124 percent greater than the 30-day average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Mining and energy
stocks climbed on higher gold and crude prices.  The Financial Times reported that European policy makers
will unveil a financial bailout program for Spain as early as
next week. Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said this week that Spain will consider seeking a
bailout if the conditions imposed are acceptable.  Manulife Drops  Sun Life tumbled 1.9 percent to C$23.14. Manulife slipped
0.8 percent to C$11.77.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY)  dipped 1.3 percent
to C$55.99. Financial stocks are up 6.9 percent this  year .  RIM tumbled 7.4 percent to C$6.25, its lowest level in more
than nine years, as users in  Europe , the  Middle East  and  Africa 
lost access to e-mail and the Internet. The malfunctions have
since been resolved, the Waterloo, Ontario-based company said in
e-mails. Apple Inc. also launched the iPhone 5 smartphone today,
seen as the biggest threat to RIM’s shrinking market share, with
sales expected to top 10 million over the weekend.  San Gold jumped 3.9 percent to C$1.08. Gold rose for a
fifth week, the longest rally since February.  Niko Resources, the  worst-performing  stock in the S&P/TSX
this year, soared 17 percent to C$11.79.  Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  gained 0.5 percent to C$32.24 and  Crescent Point
Energy Corp. (CPG)  added 4.4 percent to C$45.70. Crude for November
delivery advanced 0.5 percent to settle at $92.89 a barrel in
 New York  for its first gain in five days.  Superior Plus Corp. (SPB)  fell 3.4 percent to C$9.11, paring
earlier losses, after the propane distributor said the Canada
Revenue Agency may reassess its tax obligations related to its
2008 conversion to a company from an income trust.  To contact the reporter on this story:
