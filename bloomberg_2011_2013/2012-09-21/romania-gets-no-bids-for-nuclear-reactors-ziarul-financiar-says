Romania  received no offers for
stakes in a project to build two additional nuclear reactors at
its Cernavoda power plant,  Ziarul Financiar  reported, citing
unidentified Economy Ministry officials.  The ministry plans to find alternative funding for the
project, the cost of which is estimated at 2 billion euros ($2.6
billion), the newspaper said. A ministry official told ZF that a
letter from a China-based company expressing interest had
contained no firm offer.  Enel SpA (ENEL)  and Arcelor Mittal have
minority stakes in the project and the state has 85 percent, the
newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
