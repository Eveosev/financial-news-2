Paul Quinsee, who oversees $120
billion as head of JPMorgan Asset Management’s large-
capitalization core equity division, comments on how trading is
generally cheaper than it used to be. He spoke in an interview
with  Erik Schatzker  and  Stephanie Ruhle  on Bloomberg
Television’s “Market Makers.”  On high-frequency trading:  “High frequency is one of these issues that we hear is
putting off the stock market, and I think that’s a great pity.
Because net, we think that our ability to trade stocks for
clients actually over the last five years is considerably
improved.”  “We’ve had to really raise our game. We’ve made a lot of
investments in technology. It’s generally cheaper to trade
stocks now than it used to be, and that’s got to be a good thing
for our clients.”  On markets and  Europe :  “What’s happening in Europe has been very helpful in
calming people down. One outcome of that is that people feel a
bit more comfortable about owning stocks and we’re seeing this
sort of very high frequency stocks fall off the edges. Low
volumes are not necessarily a bad thing.”  “When you start to compare valuations with bonds, which is
where of course so much of the money has been going recently,
things look really quite interesting there. One-third of the S&P
is still yielding more than the 10-year Treasury. We haven’t
seen that in modern times. That’s a very unusual balance still
very much in favor of stocks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
