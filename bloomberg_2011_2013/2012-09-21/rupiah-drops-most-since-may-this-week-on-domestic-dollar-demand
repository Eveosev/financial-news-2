Indonesia ’s rupiah completed its
biggest weekly loss since August on speculation importers
stepped up dollar purchases after the  Federal Reserve ’s
announcement of more quantitative easing drove the local
currency to a seven-week high.  Government bonds  dropped.  The Federal Reserve announced on Sept. 13 open-ended buying
of $40 billion of mortgage debt a month to hold borrowing costs
down, a move that boosts the supply of dollars. The rupiah
touched 9,447 versus the greenback on Sept. 17, the strongest
level since Aug. 1, before retreating on each of the subsequent
three days.  The rupiah fell 0.5 percent this week to 9,548 per dollar
as of 4:11 p.m. in Jakarta, the most since the five days ended
Aug. 31, prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. The
currency advanced 0.1 percent today and reached 9,609 before the
Fed’s announcement on Sept. 13, the weakest level since May.  “The rupiah halted its rally as the QE effect recedes,”
said Putu Andi Wijaya, a foreign-exchange dealer at PT Bank
Rakyat Indonesia in Jakarta. “Corporates take any opportunity
to buy dollars whenever the rupiah reaches a good level.”  The local currency’s one-month implied volatility, which
measures exchange-rate swings used to price options, held at 5
percent this week, the lowest level since September 2008, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent notes due May 2022
climbed six basis points this week, or 0.06 percentage point, to
5.96 percent, closing prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association show. The yield rose three basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
