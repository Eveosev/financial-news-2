European Union carbon permits fell
for the first time in four days to end the week little changed
as the premium of the next-year contract dropped to a record.  EU Allowances for December closed down 2.9 percent at 7.46
euros ($9.69) a metric ton on London’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange, a drop of 1 euro cent on the week. That’s the smallest
weekly move since the week ending Jan. 21, 2011.  Governments met on Sept. 19 to discuss a European
Commission proposal to reconfirm its legal right to curb an
excess of carbon permits as of 2013. While no decisions were
reached at the meeting of the Climate Change Committee, the
Netherlands,  Poland , Slovakia and the  Czech Republic  all voiced
reservations over the plan.  “The outlook for EUA prices is now more than ever a
function of political optionality,” Isabelle Curien, an analyst
at Deutsche Bank AG in Paris, said in an e-mailed  report .  The premium for 2013 EU permits over those for 2012
narrowed as much as 5.4 percent to 35 euro cents, and closed at
36 euro cents.  Open interest in 2013 EU allowance futures gained 2.8
percent to 382 million tons as of yesterday. The contract now
has the largest open interest of any carbon futures contract.  United Nations carbon credits for December rose as much as
6 percent to 1.94 euros, the highest in more than a week, as the
weekly supply of offsets dropped 44 percent. September may see
the least supply of new credits since February 2011, according
to data on the UN website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
