York , the second straight increase. Natural gas led the advances
while silver and cotton declined.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI gauge of 26  prices  rose 0.8 percent
to 1,627.519, the first gain in five days.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures gained for a second day in New York on
speculation that stockpiles won’t reach capacity before winter
weather boosts heating demand.  U.S. inventories rose by 67 billion cubic feet last week to
3.496 trillion, below the five-year average increase for the
week of 73 billion, an Energy Department report showed
yesterday. U.S. peak working gas storage capacity was 4.239
trillion cubic feet as of April.  Natural gas for October delivery rose 8.8 cents, or 3.1

consumer, following a September price slump. Soybeans rose from

settle at $8.9725 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The

based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline rose, narrowing its losses for the week, on
speculation that stimulus from central banks will improve
economic growth and boost demand for fuel.  Nymex gasoline for October delivery rose 3.85 cents, or 1.3
percent, to settle at $2.9425 a gallon. Prices fell 2.4 percent
this week.  October-delivery heating oil rose 2.32 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $3.1207 a gallon on the exchange, trimming
