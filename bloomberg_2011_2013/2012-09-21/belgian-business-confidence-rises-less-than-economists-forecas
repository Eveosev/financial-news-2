Belgian  business confidence 
increased less than economists forecast in September as
sentiment in the manufacturing industry declined.  The confidence index for Belgium rose to minus 11.6 from
minus 11.8 in August, the Brussels-based  National Bank of
Belgium  said in a statement today. Economists had predicted a
gain to minus 11.3 this month, according to the median of 16
estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey .  “In the manufacturing industry, business confidence
dropped a little, after having enjoyed two consecutive
improvements,” the central bank said in the report. “ The
downward revision of employment forecasts contributed chiefly to
the decline.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
