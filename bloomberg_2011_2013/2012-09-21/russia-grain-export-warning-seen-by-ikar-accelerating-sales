Dmitry Rylko, the general director
of the Institute for Agricultural Market Studies, known as Ikar,
comments on Economy Minister Andrei Belousov’s warning that the
government may consider grain export curbs. Deputy Prime
Minister  Arkady Dvorkovich  was later cited by Interfax as saying
there were no such plans.  Rylko spoke by phone from Moscow today.  “This was kind of ringing a bell to grain owners.”  “There won’t be any wild changes in the market. But the
wish to get rid of grain will increase among agricultural
producers in the south after such comments.”  “This could push many people to sell grain more quickly
and not to delay sales.”  On the possibility the government will sell grain from
stockpiles to control domestic prices:  “The government may theoretically announce such sales in
the east, because this territory is far from export markets and
the local situation is tough.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
