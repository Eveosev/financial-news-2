Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. (CETV)  climbed for its fourth week of gains on speculation that a
revamp of a benchmark index will boost demand for the stock.  CME, as the television broadcaster is known, increased 0.8
percent to 145.50 koruna, taking its advance to 2.1 percent this
week and 31 percent this month.  The number of CME shares included in the CECE Composite
Index of major Polish, Czech and Hungarian equities will more
than double to 77 million from Sept. 24, according to  data  from
Wiener Boerse AG, which compiles the gauge. The move follows a
swap of CME’s bonds into shares that began trading this month.  “CME’s weighting in the index will slightly increase as a
result of the higher number of shares being included, which will
in turn support demand from funds tracking this index,”  Milan Vanicek , chief analyst at J&T Banka AS in  Prague , said by phone
today. J&T has a buy recommendation for CME with a price
estimate for its U.S.-traded shares of $11.  CME’s current  weighting  in the CECE index is 0.40 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
