New Zealand included Beauden
Barrett as one of three fly-halves in a 28-man touring squad for
the final two rounds of the inaugural Rugby Championship.  Barrett and Aaron Cruden were chosen as backups for first-
choice playmaker  Dan Carter , who’s still undergoing
rehabilitation on a calf injury that kept him out of the past
two matches. The All Blacks face Argentina on Sept. 29 before
finishing their campaign a week later in South Africa.  “Dan is recovering well from his calf injury and we are
expecting him to be fit for selection for the Argentinean
Test,” All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said in an e-mailed
statement. “However, to be on the safe side we are also taking
Beauden Barrett as cover.”  Carter, who’s scored a world record 1,318 points in 89
Tests, said on Twitter today that his calf “felt good” after a
running session and that he “even managed a few kicks.”  World champion New Zealand leads the southern hemisphere
championship standings with 16 points and will secure the
inaugural title by winning either of its remaining games.  ALL BLACKS SQUAD TO TOUR ARGENTINA AND SOUTH AFRICA:  Forwards: Andrew Hore, Keven Mealamu, Charlie Faumuina, Ben
Franks, Owen Franks, Tony Woodcock, Brodie Retallick, Luke
Romano, Sam Whitelock, Sam Cane, Richie McCaw (captain), Liam
Messam, Kieran Read, Adam Thomson, Victor Vito.  Backs: Aaron Smith,  Piri Weepu , Beauden Barrett,  Daniel
Carter , Aaron Cruden, Tamati Ellison, Ma’a Nonu,  Conrad Smith ,
