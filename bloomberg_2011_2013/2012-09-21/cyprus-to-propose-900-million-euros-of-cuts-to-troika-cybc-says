The Cypriot government, shut out of
markets since May 2011, will propose 900 million euros ($1.2
billion) of budget savings as part of its negotiations for an
international bailout, CyBC radio reported.  The measures, which include public-sector wage and pension
cuts and extended working hours for civil servants, are part of
the governmentâ€™s counter-proposal to the so-called troika that
oversees the bailouts, comprised of officials from the European
Commission, the  European Central Bank  and the  International
Monetary Fund , the Nicosia-based state-owned radio station
reported today without saying where it got the information.  The Cypriot proposal, which also includes an overhaul of
wage indexation, will be submitted to the troika before rescue
talks resume in early October, CyBC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
