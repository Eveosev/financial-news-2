Emerging-market stock funds took in
$4.3 billion in the week ended Sept. 19, hitting a 32-week high
as investors responded to stimulus measures by U.S., European
and Japanese central banks, according to EPFR Global.  So-called Global Emerging-Market funds, or GEM funds,
accounted for about three-quarters of the new money as flows
into China-dedicated funds were tempered by the countryâ€™s
dispute with Japan over islands in the  East China Sea , according
to a report e-mailed today by the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based
data provider.  China equity funds posted a net gain of over $250 million
while Brazilian equity funds posted a 102-week high of net
inflows,  Cameron Brandt , EPFR director of research, said by e-
mail today. Russia-dedicated funds recorded their second-biggest
inflow since mid-April, EPFR said.  Emerging-market bond funds registered inflows for the 15th
consecutive week, Brandt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
