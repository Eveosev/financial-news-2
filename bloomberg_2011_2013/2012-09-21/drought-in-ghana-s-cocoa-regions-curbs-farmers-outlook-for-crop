A lack of rain in  Ghana ’s cocoa-
growing regions is curbing prospects for the 2012-13 crop
harvest as droughts may cause budding pods to wither, according
to farmers.  “We have not had proper rains from June to September, the
small pods are dying,” 58-year-old Johnson Mensah, a farmer
with more than 300 acres (121 hectares) in Ghana’s Western
region where 55 percent of the nation’s cocoa is produced, said
by phone on Sept. 19. “The situation is bad, farmers are
agitated,” he said.  After reaching a record of more than 1 million metric tons
in the 2010-11 season, Ghana lowered its forecast to 900,000
tons in 2011-12 and 800,000 tons for the 2012-13 harvest, which
starts next month, on concerns over poor weather, according to
the Ghana Cocoa Board, the regulator. Cocoa has gained 14
percent this year and traded 0.7 percent lower at 1,623 pounds
($2,642) a metric ton on London’s NYSE Liffe market by 10:44
a.m..  “This year is bad in terms of rainfall,” said Charles
York, principal meteorologist at the Ghana Meteorological
Service, in an interview in the capital, Accra, on Sept. 18.
“The major rainy period of April to August remained cold but
with no rains, there was less evaporation which inhibited
rainfall.”  Below Normal  Southern Ghana, which includes the cocoa-growing regions,
has a 60 percent chance of below-normal rains for the rest of
the year, with a 30 percent chance the conditions will be
normal, York said.  “We only pray that we get the rains between now and
November, otherwise we may not even make the board’s 800,000-ton
forecast,” 55-year-old Kwaku Owusu, a chief farmer who heads a
group of 221 growers at Dadeasi, 24 miles east of Kumasi, said
by phone on Sept. 19.  Cocobod signed a $1.5 billion trade-finance facility to
fund cocoa purchases in the 2012-13 crop season, $500 million
less than in the previous period. Due to the “unpredictable
nature of the weather, we want to be on the side of caution,”
Noah Amenyah, spokesman for the board known as Cocobod, said in
an interview on Sept. 12.“We will want to take precautionary
measures.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
