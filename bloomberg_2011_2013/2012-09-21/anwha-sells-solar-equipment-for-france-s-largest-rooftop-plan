Hanwha Group , a South Korean
industrial group, supplied solar-power equipment for  France ’s
biggest rooftop installation to further its European expansion.  Hanwha SolarOne, a unit of the Seoul-based company,
delivered 7.7 megawatts of photovoltaic modules, which have been
fixed on buildings housing a Ginseng plantation in Rion-des-
Landes, it said today in a statement. France is a “key” market
where Hanwha will continue to expand, it said.  The company agreed to buy most of German solar-panel maker
 Q-Cells SE (QCE)  last month. Germany and France both offer incentives
to generate power from solar cells by providing a feed-in
tariff, a premium rate paid for energy from renewable sources.  The 36,900-panel project at Rion-des-Landes will generate
enough power for 4,000 households and is the biggest rooftop
solar plant in France, according to the statement. Solveo
Energie, a French developer, built the facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
