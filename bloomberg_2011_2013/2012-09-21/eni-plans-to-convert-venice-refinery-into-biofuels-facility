Eni SpA (ENI) ,  Italy ’s largest oil
company, plans to convert its  Venice refinery  into a biofuels
facility by 2014.  Eni staff met labor unions and city staff to review the
project, which involves an investment of about 100 million euros
($130 million), the Rome-based company said in a statement. Eni
said it will be the first conversion of a conventional refinery
into a “bio” refinery.  Conversion of the plant will begin in the second quarter of
2013 and finish by the end of the year, allowing biofuels
production to start from Jan. 1, 2014. New facilities to be
constructed will be completed in the first half of 2015.  The plant can process 80,000 barrels of crude a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
