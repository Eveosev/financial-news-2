The U.S. oil rig count declined for
the fourth time in six weeks as crude futures moved below $95 a
barrel and energy producers slowed their drilling programs.  The oil count  slipped by 11 to 1,402, data posted on  Baker
Hughes Inc. (BHI) ’s website show. The  gas rig count  rose six to 454,
the Houston oil-services company said.  The oil rig count, which has gained every quarter since
March 2009, has dropped from 1,421 on June 29 as producers
slowed exploration for crude and natural gas liquids. New
drilling technologies have boosted crude stockpiles to 22-year
highs, and crude futures, which reached $100.42 in intraday
trading Sept. 14, tumbled 7.2 percent in the first four days of
this week on concern that the world economy is slowing.  “We’re seeing some moderation in the rate of investment
and the flow of money to rigs being put to work,”  Tim Evans , an
energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in  New York , said by
telephone. “What we’re really trying to do here with the
drilling rig count is more or less rightsize it because there is
such a thing as too much all at once.”  The total  count  lost five to 1,859.  Oil for November delivery rose for the first time in five
days, by 47 cents, or 0.5 percent, to settle at $92.89 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are down 6 percent
this year.  Oil stockpiles  gained 8.53 million barrels to 367.6 million
in the week ended Sept. 14, the Energy Department said.
Production also jumped 14 percent to 6.28 million barrels a day
after drillers on the  Gulf Coast  restored output following
Hurricane Isaac.  Natural gas for October delivery climbed 8.8 cents to
settle at $2.885 per million British thermal units on the Nymex.
Prices are up 52 percent from a 10-year intraday low of $1.902
in April and down 3.5 percent for the year.  Stockpiles of the fuel  increased 67 billion cubic feet in
the week ended Sept. 14 to 3.496 trillion cubic feet, Energy
Department data showed.  California lost the most rigs, dropping by five to 37,
while  Pennsylvania  gained the most, increasing by four to 65.  Rigs on land  tumbled by seven to 1,787, the lowest count
since May 20, 2011.  Rigs in inland waters  and  miscellaneous
rigs , which primarily drill for geothermal energy, were
unchanged at 19 and three, respectively.  Vertical rigs  dropped 16 to 508, the lowest level since
March 18, 2011. Horizontal rigs gained 16 to 1,149.  The  offshore rig count  was rose by two to 53, the highest
since April 2010, while rigs in the  Gulf of Mexico  were
unchanged at 50.  Canadian energy rigs  rose for the third straight week,
increasing by nine to 363, the highest since March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
