OAO GMK  Norilsk Nickel , the worldâ€™s
largest miner of the metal, expects first-half profit to decline
by as much as a third after average prices of the metal dropped,
according to Chief Executive Officer Vladimir Strzhalkovsky.  Norilsk sees earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization of at least $2.5 billion, Strzhalkovsky said
today in an interview in Sochi, southern  Russia . Norilsk said in
October its Ebitda in the first half of 2011 was $3.74 billion.  Sales are expected to be about $6 billion and net income
may be $1.5 billion, he said. That compares with $7.3 billion in
revenue and $1.8 billion in profit last year.  Average nickel prices in  London  tumbled by 28 percent to
$18,501 a metric ton in the first half from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
