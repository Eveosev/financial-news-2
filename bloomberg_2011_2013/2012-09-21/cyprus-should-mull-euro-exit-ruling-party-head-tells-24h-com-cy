Cyprus may abandon the euro if
international lenders insist on excessively onerous austerity
measures,  24h.com.cy  reported, citing  Andros Kyprianou , general
secretary of the communist party  AKEL .  “If the troika insists on very painful measures, should we
remain stubborn and say we won’t leave the euro area because
it’s so important to us?” Kyprianou said in a  video clip  posted
on the website of the Cypriot online newspaper.  Kyprianou was referring to the so-called troika that
oversees euro-area bailouts, comprised of officials from the
European Commission, the  European Central Bank  and the
 International Monetary Fund . Cypriot President Demetris Christofias is a member and former leader of the AKEL party.  “I’m not prejudging what we should do, but I am saying
that these questions have to be discussed very seriously if we
really want to serve the interests of the Cypriot people,” he
said in a second clip.  Cyprus on June 25 became the fifth country in the euro area
to seek external aid. Euro-area finance ministers agreed to
begin talks two days later. No amount was specified for the
rescue, which will encompass the public sector as well as banks.
Cyprus also sought assistance from  Russia  and the IMF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
