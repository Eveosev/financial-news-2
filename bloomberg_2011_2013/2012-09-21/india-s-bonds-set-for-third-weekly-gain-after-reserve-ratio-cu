India ’s 10-year bonds headed for a
third weekly gain after the central bank unexpectedly reduced
the proportion of deposits lenders must set aside as reserves,
boosting the supply of funds.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao cut the
cash reserve  ratio  to 4.5 percent from 4.75 percent on Sept. 17
in the first decrease since March, adding an estimated 170
billion rupees ($3.1 billion) to the banking system. Bonds also
gained on optimism a decline in international  oil prices  will
help curb inflation in India, which imports about 80 percent of
the petroleum it uses.  Brent crude  fell 5.4 percent this week,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The resumption of monetary easing is positive for
bonds,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at
 Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai. “The decline in oil
prices will help ease concerns over inflation.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, this week to 8.16
percent, as of 9:55 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system.  The central bank kept the repurchase  rate  unchanged this
week after inflation exceeded 7 percent in August for a sixth
month this year, according to official data. The RBI cut last
cut its benchmark rate by 50 basis points to 8 percent in April.  The wholesale-price  index  rose 7.55 percent from a year
earlier, after climbing 6.87 percent in July, the Commerce
Ministry said in a statement on Sept. 14.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell three basis
points this week to 7.72 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It rose one basis point today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
