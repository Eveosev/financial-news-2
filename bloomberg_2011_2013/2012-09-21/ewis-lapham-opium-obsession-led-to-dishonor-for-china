Despite an earlier ban by the
emperor, opium was the drug of choice for the 19th-century
Chinese elite.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Some said the best plan was to declare victory in the war
on drugs, legalize opium and then tax importers and consumers.
But the authorities regarded users as “lazy and effeminate”
and decided to crack down.  When Lin Zexu was sent to Guangzhou in March 1839, he
arrested 1,700 smugglers and destroyed 1,200 tons of opium by
mixing it with lime and salt and throwing it into the Pearl
River.  Drug smuggling was central to the British East India
Company’s bottom line, so London was soon called upon to protect
the firm’s interests. Fighting began and the superior British
fleet won control of  China ’s economic lifelines.  The emperor was forced to sign the Treaty of Nanjing in
August 1842. For the first time in 200 years a Chinese ruler had
lost a war, and so began the “Century of Humiliation.”  I spoke with Odd Arne Westad, author of “Restless Empire:
China and the World Since 1750,” on the following topics:  1. Expansionist Military Power  2. Open Empire  3. Opium War  4. Succession of Crises  5. China and the U.S.  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
