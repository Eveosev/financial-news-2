U.S. Gulf Coast oil premiums
strengthened as the differential between West Texas Intermediate
and Brent increased.  The difference between the benchmarks  widened  92 cents to
$18.53 a barrel. When Brent rises at a faster pace than WTI, as
it did today, that typically strengthens the value of U.S.
grades competing with foreign oils priced against the European
benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium added 80 cents to $18.80 a
barrel at 1:48 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s increased 5 cents to $19.80.  Poseidon’s  premium  widened $1.10 to $10.70. Mars Blend
added $1.20 to $11.70 a barrel over WTI and Southern Green
Canyon increased 90 cents to a premium of $10.50.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
widened $1 to $19.75 above WTI.  The premium for Syncrude added 50 cents to $7.50 a barrel
above WTI. The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed 75
cents to $13 a barrel below the U.S. benchmark.  Bakken’s premium to WTI widened 75 cents to $5.75 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
