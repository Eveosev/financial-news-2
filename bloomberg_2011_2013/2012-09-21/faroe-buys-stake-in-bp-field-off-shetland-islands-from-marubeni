Faroe Petroleum Plc (FPM) , an  oil company 
focused on the U.K. and  Norway , agreed to invest in a field off
the Shetland Islands as it seeks to raise production to boost
funds for exploration.  Faroe will pay  Marubeni Oil & Gas Ltd.  $32 million for a 10
percent stake in the East Foinaven field and a 0.5 percent share
in the West Shetland Pipeline System, it said today in a
statement. The pipe network transports natural gas from the BP
Plc-operated field and two others to the Shetland Islands.  “East Foinaven is a good-quality producing field,” Graham
Stewart, chief executive officer of Aberdeen, Scotland-based
Faroe, said in the statement. The purchase “is in line with our
strategy to grow our production portfolio to continue the
funding of our exploration program.”  Stewart said this week that Faroe is seeking to expand its
search for oil and gas by acquiring stakes in mature projects.
The company has already invested in the  Barents Sea ’s Darwin
prospect, operated by  Spain ’s Repsol SA, where drilling is
planned to begin at the end of this year.  The East Foinaven deposit, in blocks 204/24a and 25b, was
discovered in 1995 and developed as a subsea tieback to the
nearby Foinaven field. It produced its first oil in 2001, and
gross output this year is forecast to average about 3,500
barrels of oil equivalent a day, Faroe said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
