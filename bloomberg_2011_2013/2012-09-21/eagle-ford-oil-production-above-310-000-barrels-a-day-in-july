Oil production in the Eagle Ford
shale formation of southern  Texas  topped 310,000 barrels a day
in July.  The nine fields that make up the majority of the 400-mile-
long (644-kilometer) play pumped out 310,370 barrels a day,
preliminary data on the Texas Railroad Commission’s  website 
showed. That’s up from a revised count of 309,979 barrels a day
in June, and 120,532 a day in July 2011.  The fields produced 51,676 barrels a day of condensate and
1.21 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas in July.  Growing production out of Eagle Ford is helping fuel a
renaissance in  Texas crude . The state produced 1.9 million
barrels a day in June, the highest monthly level since April
1991, according to the U.S. Energy Department.  The Railroad Commission oversees oil and gas drilling in
the state. It collects monthly production reports from sites on
which it permits drilling.  The agency updates the data on its website once a month.
Those updates typically change as revised, corrected or late
reports are received. Last month, for example, preliminary data
showed June’s Eagle Ford production at 283,292 barrels a day.  Plains Marketing LP ’s posted price for Eagle Ford oil
today was  $100.70 a barrel , between yesterday’s settlement
prices of $91.87 for West Texas Intermediate and $110.03 for
Brent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
