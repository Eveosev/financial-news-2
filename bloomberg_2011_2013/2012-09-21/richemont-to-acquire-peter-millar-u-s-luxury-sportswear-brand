Cie. Financiere Richemont SA (CFR) , the
maker of Chloe bags and Dunhill briefcases, agreed to buy Peter
Millar LLC, a U.S. maker of luxury sportswear for an undisclosed
amount.  Richemont expects to complete the purchase in October, and
it won’t have a “material” effect on profit in the year
through March 2013, the Geneva-based company said in a statement
today.  Peter Millar was created in 2001 by Chris Knott, who named
the company after an inscription on an antique lawn bowling ball
he received from his mother. Knott worked more than 20 years in
fashion for companies such as  Hugo Boss AG (BOSS)  and  Burberry Group
Plc. (BRBY)   The clothing maker’s business operations are based in
Durham,  North Carolina , and it has a design center in Raleigh,
according to its website. Peter Millar makes comfortable
garments for men and women for work or leisure, the company
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
