Residents of  Zimbabwe ’s second-
largest city, Bulawayo, have been told to synchronize their
lavatory flushing following periods of water rationing, the city
council has said.  The city of about 1 million people, in south western
Zimbabwe, is rationing water after the region was affected by
drought.  “We’re asking residents to flush their lavatories at
precisely 7.30 p.m. on the day that water is re-introduced to
their homes,” city spokeswoman Nesisa Mpofu said in a telephone
interview from Bulawayo today.  City-wide synchronized flushing will reduce blockages and
burst pipes, Mpofu said. Bulawayo suburbs are being deprived of
water for periods of about 72-hours because there isn’t enough
to meet the city’s needs, she said.  Two of the city’s five water storage dams have been “de-
commissioned” due to the drought, while a further two may dry
up before the rainy season begins in November, Mpofu said.  “Water rationing may be extended to 92-hour periods. The
situation is very serious,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
