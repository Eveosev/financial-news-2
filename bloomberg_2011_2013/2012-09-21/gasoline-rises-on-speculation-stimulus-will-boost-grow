Gasoline rose in  New York  on
speculation that stimulus from central banks will improve
economic growth and boost demand for fuel.  The motor fuel climbed as much as 1.7 percent after the
Financial Times reported that Spanish and European Union
officials are working on plans to trigger bond purchases by the
 European Central Bank .  “There is expectation that there will be continued
quantitative easing from central banks around the world to
improve economic prospects,” said  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. There is also “optimism
that Europe will resolve the Spanish debt crisis.”  Gasoline for October delivery rose 3.01 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.9341 a gallon at 9:27 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Regular gasoline at the pump slipped for a seventh
consecutive day, dropping 1.3 cents to $3.833 a gallon
yesterday, AAA  data  show. Prices reached a 2012 high of $3.936
on April 4.  October-delivery heating oil rose 1.88 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $3.1163 a gallon a gallon on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
