Canada ’s trade minister said he’s
confident his country can still reach a free-trade agreement
with the European Union this year as long as both sides are
motivated to do so.  “I’ve always said we’re aiming to complete negotiations in
2012 and as long as both parties bring a high level of ambition
and goodwill to the table, I’m confident that we’re going to be
able to conclude these negotiations soon,” Trade Minister Ed Fast told reporters in Ottawa today.  The EU and Canada started  talks  toward a free-trade pact in
May 2009.  “We’re now down to the final few issues left to be
negotiated. These are intense discussions but we are making
significant progress,” he said.  Fast said he plans to meet “very soon” with his
counterpart in  Quebec , where the separatist Parti Quebecois won
a minority government in an election Sept. 4.  “These are the most collaborative negotiations Canada has
ever undertaken to the extent that the provinces and territories
have actually been at the table when it comes to negotiations in
their jurisdictions,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
