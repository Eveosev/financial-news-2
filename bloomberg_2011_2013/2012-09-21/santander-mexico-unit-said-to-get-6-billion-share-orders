Banco Santander SA (SAN) ’s Mexico unit
attracted more than $6 billion in orders for its shares, or
about 1 1/2 times the size of next week’s planned offering, two
people familiar with the deal said.  The shares are still being marketed and demand could
increase further, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because talks with investors are private.  Santander said Sept. 4 it would raise as much as 3.41
billion euros ($4.43 billion) by selling about 24.9 percent of
its Mexican unit at 29 pesos ($2.26) to 33.50 pesos a share in
the country’s biggest stock sale. The bank currently has shares
listed in Mexico that represent 0.13 percent of the company,
stemming from Santander’s purchase of Grupo Financiero Serfin SA
in 2000.  Santander’s Mexican bank has outperformed its Spanish
business. Profit in  Mexico  jumped 14 percent in the first half
to 556 million euros, buoyed by surging loan growth, while
earnings in Spain fell 37 percent as the economy shrank and the
sovereign-debt crisis worsened. The  International Monetary Fund 
predicts 3.9 percent economic growth in Mexico in 2012, compared
with a 1.7 percent contraction in Spain.  The offering values the Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico
SAB unit at as much as 13.7 billion euros, and shares will start
trading on or around Sept. 26 in Mexico and  New York , the bank
said.  Gamal Duran, a Mexico City-based press official with
Santander, declined to comment on demand for the sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
