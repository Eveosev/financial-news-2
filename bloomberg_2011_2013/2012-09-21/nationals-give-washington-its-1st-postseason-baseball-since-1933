The Washington Nationals joined the
 Cincinnati Reds  as the first two Major League Baseball teams to
clinch 2012 playoff spots.  The Nationals won 4-1 against the visiting Los Angeles
Dodgers tonight, giving the nationâ€™s capital a postseason
baseball team for the first time in 79 years.  Earlier today, the Reds (91-59) won 5-3 at the Chicago Cubs
to become the first team to assure itself of a postseason spot.  The Nationals (91-58), who have the best record in the
major leagues, are the first Washington team to make the
postseason since the 1933 Senators won the American League
pennant and then lost the  World Series  in five games to the New
York Giants.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
