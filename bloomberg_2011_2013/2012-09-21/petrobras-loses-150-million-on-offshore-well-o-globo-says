Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, spent $150 million on a well it
had to abandon off the coast of Amapa state in the northeastern
part of the country, the  O Globo  newspaper said, citing a person
it didn’t name.  Strong currents dragged the rig away from the drilling site
and Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based producer is known,
stopped work on the well,  O Globo  said. The incident raised
concerns at Brazil’s oil regulator, known as ANP, because the
government plans to auction oil exploration blocks in the area
next year, O Globo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
