French corn rated as good or
excellent was stable in the week through Sept. 17 as farmers
started harvesting, crop office FranceAgriMer said.  Corn that received the top ratings was unchanged from a
week earlier at 68 percent of the crop, the office wrote in a
harvest-progress  report  on its website today. That’s down from
81 percent rated good or excellent at the same time last year.  Farmers had harvested 1 percent of the corn crop at the
start of the week, compared with 4 percent a year ago, according
to the crop office.  France  is the European Union’s biggest
grower of the grain.  The portion of French corn at 50 percent or less grain
humidity, an indicator of crop maturity, increased to 92 percent
from 76 percent a week earlier, FranceAgriMer said. That’s the
same as a year ago, the data show. Corn kernel moisture
decreases as the grain develops.  To contact the report on this story:
