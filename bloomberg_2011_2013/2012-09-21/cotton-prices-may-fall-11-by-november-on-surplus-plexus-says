Cotton prices may fall as much as
11 percent by November as supplies from the harvest in the U.S.,
the world’s biggest exporter, outpace global demand, according
to Plexus Cotton Ltd.  “We have pretty good weather right now and the crop is
making progress, but as stocks pile up, there are not enough
buyers to take them,” Peter Egli, a Chicago-based director of
risk management at the cotton merchant, said today in a
telephone interview.  The price may touch 65 cents to 70 cents a pound, he said.
Through yesterday, cotton futures slumped 29 percent in the past
12 months as worldwide inventories expanded.  The U.S. crop may increase by 1.5 million bales from a year
earlier, and “a large part of the U.S. and other Northern
Hemisphere crops remains unsold,” Liverpool, U.K.-based Plexus
said today in a report. A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218
kilograms.  Import demand by  China , the biggest consumer, may decline
because of ample domestic supplies. “What are the owners of
new-crop cotton going to do when Chinese buyers remain in
hiding,” Plexus said in the report.  Cotton for December delivery fell 2.4 percent to 73.39
cents at 1:05 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , heading for
the biggest drop for a most-active contract since Aug. 10.  Yesterday, Cotlook Ltd., the publisher of a benchmark price
index, boosted its estimate for the global surplus by 8 percent
to 3.296 million metric tons from a month earlier, citing lower
Chinese demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
