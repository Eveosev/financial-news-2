Taiwan ’s dollar completed a fifth
weekly gain, the longest winning streak in seven months, as
monetary easing in the U.S. and Japan spurred demand for
emerging-market assets.  Foreigners bought $800 million more Taiwanese shares than
they sold this week, exchange data show. Governor Perng Fai-nan
said he’ll maintain relative stability in the local dollar and
step into the market in the event of abnormal fluctuations. The
 Federal Reserve  announced last week open-ended buying of $40
billion of mortgage debt per month in a third round of
quantitative easing. The  Bank of Japan (8301)  unexpectedly expanded its
asset-purchase fund this week.  “Some exporters are selling the greenback now as they’re
worried the gains may extend due to QE3,” said Tarsicio Tong, a
foreign-exchange trader at  Union Bank of Taiwan (2838)  in Taipei. “But
Perng has made it quite clear that he wants the currency to be
stable. I think it might go back to pre-QE3 levels in a month.”  The  Taiwan dollar  rose 0.1 percent this week and 0.2
percent today to NT$29.45 against its U.S. counterpart,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency has gained 1.8
percent this month.  The currency was trading 0.6 percent stronger one minute
before the end of the 4 p.m. close and trimmed gains on
speculation the central bank intervened to check appreciation of
the currency, according to two traders who asked not to be
identified.  One-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.2 percent to
NT$29.33 against the greenback, trading at a 0.4 percent premium
to the spot rate.  Orders from abroad for Taiwanese goods dropped 1.5 percent
in August from a year earlier, declining for a sixth month,
official data showed yesterday. The central bank left its
 benchmark   interest rate  at 1.875 percent yesterday, as predicted
by 17 of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.125 percent notes due September
2022 slipped one basis point to 1.179 percent during the five-
day period, according to Gretai Securities Market.  The  overnight money-market rate  held at 0.388 percent, a
weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center
shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
