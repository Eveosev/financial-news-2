Adidas AG (ADS) , the world’s second-
biggest sporting-goods maker, increased its 2015 sales forecast
for the Adidas brand, while cutting the goal for Reebok.  Sales under the Adidas brand will be 12.8 billion euros
($16.6 billion), up 5 percent from a November 2010 projection of
12.2 billion euros, the company said today in a statement.  Adidas cut the forecast for Reebok’s revenue to 2 billion
euros from 3 billion euros, citing a decision not to renew a
contract with the National Football League, a change in
reporting of ice hockey-related license sales and a focus on
“margin and operational efficiency.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
