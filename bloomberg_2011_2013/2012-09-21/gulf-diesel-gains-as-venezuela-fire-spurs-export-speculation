U.S. Gulf Coast diesel rose for a
fourth day as  Petroleos de Venezuela SA  worked to extinguish a
tank fire at its El Palito refinery, raising speculation of
greater demand for U.S. exports.  Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  said on state television
yesterday that a second fire at the 130,000-barrel a day plant
is under control. Before the flames erupted at the  storage
tanks , PDVSA was working to restart the main processing units at
its Amuay refinery in western Venezuela after a gas leak caused
an explosion on Aug. 25.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the Gulf Coast
rose 2 cents to 5.75 cents a gallon versus heating oil futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:48 p.m. Prompt
delivery rose 4.91 cents to $3.1837.  U.S. exports of refined products to Venezuela rose to
103,000 barrels a day in June, the highest level of any month on
record, according to the Energy Department. Product exports to
the South American country have averaged 48,500 barrels a day
this year, up from the previous record of 32,000 a day in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
