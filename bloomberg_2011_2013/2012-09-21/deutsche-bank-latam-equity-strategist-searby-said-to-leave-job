Frederick Searby is no longer
working at  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , where he oversaw Latin America
equity strategy, according to a person with direct knowledge of
the move who asked not to be identified because he isnâ€™t
authorized to speak publicly on the matter.  Sigalit Grego, a spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, declined to
comment. Searby, who was based in New York, declined to comment
