Grupo Posadas SAB (POSADASA) , a Latin American
hotel operator, is looking to extend the maturities on debt
denominated in pesos and dollars.  Chief Financial Officer Ruben Camiro said the Mexico City-
based company plans to push out due dates on its 2.25 billion
pesos ($175 million) of debt maturing in April 2013 and $200
million of dollar bonds due in 2015. The company hopes to extend
the dollar bond maturities by at least three years, he said by
phone yesterday from Mexico City.  “We would like to repackage everything and move it down
the road,” he said.  Posadas plans to extend the debt maturities after closing
the sale of its South American operations to Paris-based  Accor
SA (AC) , according to Camiro. The deal announced on July 16 is for
$275 million dollars and will leave Posadas with net debt of
about $200 million, Camiro said. He said the sale is “on
track” and should close “very soon.”  Yields on Posadas’s dollar bonds due in 2015 rose four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.94 percent
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
securities’ yields have tumbled 656 basis points since Posadas
announced the asset sale more than two months ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
