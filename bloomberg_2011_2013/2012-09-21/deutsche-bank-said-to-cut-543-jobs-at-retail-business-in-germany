Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  will cut about 543
jobs by merging back office operations at its retail business in
Germany, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  The lender will combine the activities of its Deutsche
Bank, Norisbank and Postbank brands, said the person, who asked
not to be identified because the size of the cuts hasn’t been
made public. While Deutsche Bank will bundle back office
operations, the firm doesn’t plan to cut more staff than it has
agreed with labor representatives,  Ronald Weichert , a spokesman
for the company said today in an e-mail.  The world’s biggest banks are reducing staff to help
counter a slide in revenue as Europe’s sovereign debt crisis
deters client trading and investment. Deutsche Bank said in July
that it will eliminate about 1,900 positions, mostly outside
Germany, in a bid to boost profitability.  Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest lender, has been in
“constructive” talks with labor representatives for one and a
half years as it integrates Deutsche Postbank AG, Weichert said.  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported earlier that Deutsche Bank
would cut 543 positions in Bonn and Frankfurt in departments
including finance, risk and legal. The German newspaper also
cited an unidentified person familiar with the matter as saying
4,000 to 6,000 jobs could be eliminated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
