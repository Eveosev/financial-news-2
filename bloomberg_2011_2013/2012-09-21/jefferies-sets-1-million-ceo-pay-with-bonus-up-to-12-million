Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  set a $1
million salary for both its chief executive officer and the
chairman of its executive committee, along with an annual bonus
of as much as $12 million.  The sums apply to CEO Richard B. Handler, and Brian P. Friedman, who leads the executive committee, for 2013 through
2015, according to a filing today from the New York-based
investment bank. The pair will also receive as many as 830,140
shares each of restricted stock annually.  Handler, 51, who has led the firm since 2001, is credited
with building Jefferies from an equity-trading shop into a full-
scale investment bank. He was awarded $14 million for the fiscal
year ended Nov. 30 after declining a $4.88 million bonus as the
firm’s shares slid 48 percent last year. The package included $1
million in salary and $13 million in restricted-stock units that
were granted in 2010, Jefferies said in a March 28 filing.  Friedman, 56, was granted a $10.5 million package for
fiscal 2011, the March filing shows, including a $750,000 salary
and $9.75 million in restricted stock units that were granted in
2010. Friedman also gave back his bonus in 2011, the firm said.  Jefferies reported yesterday that profit rose 2.8 percent
in the third quarter, beating analysts’ estimates as trading
revenue more than doubled. Net income for the three months ended
Aug. 31 was $70.2 million, or 31 cents a share, compared with
$68.3 million, or 30 cents, a year earlier, the firm said  in a
statement. Earnings adjusted for one-time items were 32 cents a
share, compared with the average estimate of five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg for 26 cents a share.  Jefferies gained 1 percent to close at $14.66 in  New York 
trading. The firm’s shares have climbed 6.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
