MetLife Inc. (MET) , the insurer seeking
to exit banking to limit U.S. oversight, amended a deal to sell
about $7 billion in deposits to  General Electric Co. (GE)  so that
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approval is no longer required.  The deal will now be subject to approval from the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency, the New York-based insurer said
yesterday in a regulatory filing. Under the new arrangement, the
deposits would be assumed by GE Capital Retail Bank rather than
GE Capital Bank, the insurer said. MetLife gained 2.7 percent to
$35.80 as of 6:01 p.m. yesterday in extended trading in New
York.  MetLife Chief Executive Officer  Steven Kandarian  is seeking
to reduce supervision from the  Federal Reserve  after the
regulator twice blocked his company’s plans to return capital to
shareholders. MetLife may increase its dividend and repurchase
shares after exiting bank status, according to Barclays Plc.  The new arrangement will “enable us to ultimately
deregister as a bank holding company following completion of the
deal,”  Christopher Breslin , a MetLife spokesman, said yesterday
by phone. He declined to say when the sale would be completed or
discuss the oversight of the Fed, which had given MetLife a
Sept. 30 deadline to submit a new capital plan.  Bryan Hubbard , an OCC spokesman, didn’t respond to requests
for comment.  ‘Better Fit’  “We made the decision to restructure the transaction,”
 Russell Wilkerson , a spokesman for Fairfield, Connecticut-based
GE, said yesterday. “As we went through the integration
process, which has been going on since December of last year, we
saw the consumer deposits, technology platform and strategic
needs in the retail bank were a better fit.”  MetLife said that once the deal is complete, it will take
steps with the FDIC to terminate its deposit insurance and
deregister as a bank holding company.  “As of now, the GE application is pending,”  Andrew Gray ,
an FDIC spokesman, said yesterday.  MetLife said in March that it would escape bank status by
the end of June. Kandarian later backed away from that
assessment, saying he couldn’t read regulators. MetLife had a
June 12 deadline to submit a fresh capital plan to the Fed, and
the regulator extended the deadline to Sept. 30.  MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, has kept its annual
 dividend  at 74 cents a share since 2007 and hasn’t announced a
buyback since 2008. No. 2  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  increased
its payout in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The Newark, New Jersey-based
company isn’t subject to the same Fed scrutiny.  The Fed said March 13 that MetLife would fall short of U.S.
capital standards in a severe economic downturn. MetLife was the
only insurer among 19 large financial institutions the Fed
evaluated. The shares fell 12 percent since then through the
close of trading yesterday on the  New York  Stock Exchange.  MetLife has said the Fed’s model isn’t appropriate for
insurers, which are usually overseen by state regulators in the
U.S., and that the company was at an unfair advantage against
smaller rivals who didn’t face the scrutiny.  To contact the reporter on this story:
