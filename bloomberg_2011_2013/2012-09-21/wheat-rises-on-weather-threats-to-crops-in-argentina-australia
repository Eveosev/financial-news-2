Wheat rose for the second time in
three days as unusually heavy rain threatens crops in  Argentina 
while dry weather erodes production prospects in  Australia .  Storms in central Argentina followed by cold weather will
slow development of wheat plants, and more cool weather is
expected next week, forecaster Telvent DTN said in a report
today. In Australia, little rain is expected in the next seven
days, and wheat “will suffer” if precipitation doesn’t start
falling soon, said Joel Burgio, a meteorologist with Telvent.  “Yields are worse than expected” in Argentina because of
excessive rainfall, Jamey Kohake, a broker and branch manager at
Paragon Investments in  Silver Lake , Kansas, said by telephone.
“The Australia weather forecast is drier than it was earlier
this week.”  Wheat futures for December delivery climbed 2 percent to
settle at $8.9725 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price slumped 2.9 percent this week, partly on
speculation that global demand will decline.  Australia was the world’s second-biggest exporter of wheat
last year, behind the U.S. Argentina ranked fifth behind Russia
and  Canada .  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
