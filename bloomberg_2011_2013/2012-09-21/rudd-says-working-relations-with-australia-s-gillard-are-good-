Former Australian Prime Minister
 Kevin Rudd  said he has good working relations with his successor
 Julia Gillard  and is trying to help the governing Labor Party
win elections due next year.  “It’s a good professional working relationship,” Rudd,
who was ousted by Gillard in a party room coup in 2010, said in
an interview with  Bloomberg News  in Singapore. “My job as a
member of Parliament is to support the government’s selling of
its message.”  Rudd enjoyed record-high popularity early in his 31 months
in office after defeating  John Howard ’s Liberal-National
coalition government in 2007. He was toppled amid complaints
about his autocratic style and in February lost a leadership
ballot in which he tried to reclaim the prime minister job from
Gillard.  Support for the Labor government climbed to an 18-month
high in an opinion poll published this week. Labor’s primary
vote rose 3 percentage points to 36 percent, while  Tony Abbott ’s
Liberal-National coalition slid 5 points to 41 percent,
according to a Newspoll survey published in the Australian
newspaper Sept. 17.  Rudd, who attended the Singapore Global Dialogue
conference, said Labor had become “increasingly successful” in
articulating what an Abbott-led government would mean for
Australia.  That would include cutting public service jobs, “gutting
health and gutting education, and not having a credible economic
strategy for the country once the mining boom is over,” he
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
