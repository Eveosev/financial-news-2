The Romanian utility Compania de
Utilitati Publice RA Focsani plans to borrow as much as 45
million lei ($13 million) to fund water and sewage upgrades in
the eastern county of Vrancea.  RA Foscani is seeking bids for a revolving credit line
under a 240-month contract by Nov. 6 as the utility plans to use
the funds to co-finance the upgrade project, according to an EU
 procurement document published today.   To contact the reporter on this story:
