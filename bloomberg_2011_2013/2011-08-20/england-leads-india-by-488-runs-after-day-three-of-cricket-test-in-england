India  faces an innings defeat to
England after the fourth day of the final cricket Test at the
Oval in London.  The visitors, following on, have reached 129-3 in their
second innings, after being all out for 300 in their first. They
still trail by 162 runs.  Rahul Dravid , who made an unbeaten 146 in Indiaâ€™s first
innings, came straight out to bat in the second but could only
make 13 before being caught off Graeme Swann. Virender Sehwag
(33) and VVS Laxman (24) have also been dismissed. Sachin
Tendulkar is not out 35 and Amit Mishra has 8.  England had totaled 591-6 declared, including a career-best
235 from Ian Bell and 175 from Kevin Pietersen.  India resumed today on 103-5, and lost captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni before lunch, caught behind off James Anderson for
17. After the break,  Tim Bresnan  dismissed Mishra for 43, and
 Gautam Gambhir  went for 10. England then got RP Singh and
Sreesanth out as Dravid was left stranded in the afternoon
session.  England leads the four-match series 3-0 and has guaranteed
its place as the No. 1 team in the International Cricket Council
Test rankings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
