A tax on financial transactions
would be useless because stock exchange professionals can switch
trading to a tax-free country with a single computer click,
Andreas Schmitz, president of the Association of German Banks,
said in an article published by  Bild  am Sonntag said.  The tax won’t raise significant proceeds, Schmitz wrote in
