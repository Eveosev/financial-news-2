Comdirect Bank AG (COM)  Chief Financial
Officer Christian Diekmann said trading volumes that were triple
the average may fuel record earnings for the unit of  Commerzbank
AG (CBK) ,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung  reported.  The market turbulence has made the past weeks some of the
“best since the founding of the company,” Diekmann said, FAS
reported.  Profit for the Commerzbank AG unit this year will probably
exceed the record of 90.5 million euros ($130.3 million) set in
2007, Diekmann told the German newspaper in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
