Bain Capital LLC has outbid  Sage
Group Plc (SGE)  in the contest to acquire  Australia ’s software maker
MYOB Pty Ltd., the Financial Times said, citing unidentified
people familiar with the discussions.  Sage’s falling share price made the acquisition difficult
as it would require a shareholder vote to take over MYOB, which
is now worth more than 25 percent of its own market value,
according to the FT report.  Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. Ltd. is also a bidder and a
deal may be concluded in coming days, the FT said.  ``MYOB doesn't comment on speculation,'' Julian Smith, an
Auckland-based spokesman for the company, said of the report 
in a telephone interview today with Bloomberg News. ``For
us it's very much business as normal.''  To contact the reporter on this story:
