North Korean leader Kim Jong Il will
meet with President  Dmitry Medvedev  during a visit to Russia
that began today, the Kremlin said in an e-mailed statement.  The visit will be Kim’s first since 2002 when he met then
President Vladimir Putin. North Korea’s official Korean Central
News Agency said Kim will travel to Siberia and Russia’s Far
Eastern region.  Russia is in talks with companies from North Korea and
 South Korea  to build a natural-gas pipeline to supply fuel to
both countries, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Aug. 8.  Russia is part of the stalled six-nation talks along with
China and U.S. aimed at dismantling North Korea’s nuclear
program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
