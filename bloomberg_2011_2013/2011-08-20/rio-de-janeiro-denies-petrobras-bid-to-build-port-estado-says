Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro state denied
a request from Petroleo Brasileiro SA to build a port in
Sepetiba bay to support the oil company’s deep-water drilling in
the area, O Estado de S.Paulo reported, citing state Energy
Secretary Julio Bueno.  Four companies other than Petrobras, as Petroleo Brasileiro
is known, applied for permits to build in Sepetiba bay, a number
that was considered excessive by local authorities, Estado said.
Petrobras may submit a new request to build a port in
partnership with Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA and Gerdau SA,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
