Horst Seehofer , head of the CSU
party that’s in a governing coalition with German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel ’s party, said he opposes issuing common euro
bonds, WirtschaftsWoche said, citing an  interview  with the
minister.  While the CSU “turned a blind eye” to bond repurchases by
the  European Central Bank , it won’t take the next step towards
the collectivization of debt, Seehofer told the German magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
