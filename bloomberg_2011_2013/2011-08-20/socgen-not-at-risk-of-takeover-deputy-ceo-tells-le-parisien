Societe Generale SA Deputy Chief
Executive Officer Jean-Francois Sammarcelli doesn’t believe
 France ’s second-largest bank risks becoming a takeover target
because of its recent share price decline,  Le Parisien  reported,
citing the executive.  Being taken over “is the only danger when share prices are
low” but “in the current world it’s not an issue, in my
opinion,” Sammarcelli, one of the bank’s three deputy CEOs,
told the French daily in an interview published today. “It
would be very hard because regulators ask banks not to grow, so
I don’t see who would be big enough to make a bid on Societe
Generale.”  Shares in European banks have tumbled over the past weeks
on concern they will struggle to fund themselves and increase
earnings as the region’s sovereign debt crisis strangles
economic growth. Paris-based  Societe Generale (GLE) ’s shares have lost
39 percent in the past month, also hurt by speculation that a
deterioration in France’s creditworthiness may damage its
stability. Chief Executive Officer  Frederic Oudea  called the
rumors “absolute rubbish” in an Aug. 10 interview with CNBC.  The bank’s “current share price performance is completely
irrational,” Sammarcelli told Le Parisien. “We always have a
very satisfactory financial position,” he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
