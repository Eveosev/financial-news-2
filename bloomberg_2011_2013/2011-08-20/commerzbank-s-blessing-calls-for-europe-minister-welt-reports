Europe needs a finance minister and
a fiscal administration that has the right to raise its own
taxes and decide on the budgets of countries that don’t stick to
the rules,  Martin Blessing , chief executive officer of
 Commerzbank AG (CBK) , said in an article published by  Welt  am Sonntag.  The fiscal administration should set up a European debt
agency for the issuance of common debt, Blessing wrote in a
guest commentary to be published in tomorrow’s edition of the
German newspaper.  The only two options for Europe are a return to national
currencies, which could lead to a political and economic
collapse in the region, or a fiscal union, which would take
effort and carries its own risks, Blessing said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
