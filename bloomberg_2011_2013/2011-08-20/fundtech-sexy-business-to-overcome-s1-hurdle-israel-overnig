(Corrects date of announcement in second paragraph.)  Fundtech Ltd. (FNDT)  Chief Executive
Officer Reuven Ben Menachem said his company can thrive even if
a planned sale to  S1 Corp. (SONE)  falls through as banks’ focus on
earning fees from transactions boosts demand for its software.  Concern that S1 will scrap its $700 million deal to buy
Herzliya, Israel-based Fundtech has pushed the company’s
American depositary receipts to the lowest level in nine months.
 ACI Worldwide Inc. (ACIW) , based in New York, proposed buying Norcross,
Georgia-based S1 for $9.50 a share on July 26, casting doubt on
S1’s plans to buy Fundtech, announced a month earlier.  Fundtech will benefit from selling software to banks
seeking to bolster fees on electronic payments, transfers and
other transactions as lending becomes less profitable, Ben
Menachem said in an interview.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Germany ’s
largest bank and a Fundtech customer, said April 28 that
transaction banking pretax first-quarter profit more than
doubled to 257 million euros ($370 million) in the quarter,
helped by the acquisition of the ABN Amro units.  “Transaction banking has become a very sexy, profitable
business as fee-for-services is more attractive than lending,”
Ben Menachem, 50, said by telephone from Herzliya. “We’ve done
very well as a standalone company and we’ll continue to do very
well” even if S1 shareholders reject the proposal to acquire
Fundtech at a meeting on Sept. 22, he said.  The 27 member-states of the  Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision , aiming to fortify the global financial system, will
require banks to bolster capital and reduce reliance on
borrowing, under its Basel III policy.  Israeli Air Force  “With the changes that have happened over the last three
years in the banking world, and with Basel III, lending money is
more difficult,” he said. “Even through difficult times, the
cash management business has maintained its growth.”  After gaining experience from operating communications
networks for the Israeli Air Force, Ben Menachem developed
software for banks’ payment systems and founded Fundtech in
1993. The company, whose clients also include HSBC Plc and  Bank
of America Corp. (BAC) , first sold shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market
five years later.  Israel, whose population of 7.7 million is similar to
 Switzerland ’s, has 57 companies traded on the Nasdaq, the most
of any country outside the U.S. after  China . It is also home to
the largest number of startup companies per capita in the world.  Israeli technology companies raised $569 million in capital
during the second quarter of 2011, the most in two years and up
from $343 million in the same period last year, according to the
Israel Venture Capital-KPMG Quarterly Survey released July 13.  U.S. Index  Israel’s stock market was upgraded to developed market
status by MSCI Inc. in May 2010, the same month the 63-year-old
country was accepted to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development.  The Bloomberg Israel-US 25 Index of the largest Israeli
companies traded in  New York  fell 1.1 percent to 81.23 on Aug.
19, extending its weekly loss to 4.3 percent.  Israel’s TA-25 Index dropped 3.8 percent to 1,065.18 on
Aug. 18. The measure has lost 20 percent this year. The
Bloomberg Israel-US 25 Index is down 22 percent this year.  Ben Menachem said he was “surprised” by ACI’s offer to
buy S1, whose board instructed shareholders to disregard ACI’s
proposal and vote for the purchase of Fundtech, according to an
e-mailed statement on Aug. 11.  “The combination with Fundtech will establish a strong
platform to accelerate revenue growth, increase earnings and
generate significant value for stockholders,” S1 said in the
statement.  Pending Acquisition  S1 shares jumped 30 percent to $9.26 on July 26 following
ACI’s announcement, the biggest increase in 11 years.  S1’s acquisition of Fundtech would help the company access
new markets in  Africa  and South America, Ben Menachem said.  Fundtech shares have dropped 21 percent since ACI proposed
to purchase S1, pushing the company’s valuation to 13.9 times
estimated earnings, in line with the Nasdaq Composite Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fundtech retreated 2.1 percent to $15.08 in New York on
Aug. 19, after the Israeli-traded stock fell 1.3 percent to
55.51 shekels, or the equivalent of $15.54, on Aug. 18.  The company, 59 percent owned by Israeli billionaire Nochi Dankner’s Clal Industries and Investments Ltd., said on Aug. 3
that second-quarter revenue rose 16 percent to $40.5 million.  Fundtech expects annual earnings to rise in 2011 to a range
of $1.03 to $1.13 per share, from 79 cents last year, it said.  Rockets Strike  The shekel weakened 0.5 percent to 3.5760 per  U.S. dollar 
on Aug. 19. The currency has lost 1.2 percent last week, the
worst performer among 10 emerging markets in  Europe ,  Middle East 
and Africa tracked by Bloomberg.  Israel said on Aug. 19 that its military attacked weapons
factories and smuggling tunnels in the Hamas-controlled  Gaza
Strip  after rockets struck its south. The day before, attacks
outside the resort city of Eilat killed eight soldiers and
civilians.  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) , the world’s largest
maker of generic drugs, fell 0.2 percent to $38.73 on Aug. 19,
bringing its loss for the week to 2.4 percent. Tel Aviv-traded
shares retreated 2 percent to 139.40 shekels, or the equivalent
of $38.90.  Teva isn’t responsible for a 2008 hepatitis outbreak in
 Nevada  blamed on the misuse of vials of the anesthetic propofol,
Mark Tully, a lawyer for Teva, told jurors on Aug. 19 in a trial
of three lawsuits against the company.  Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX) , the maker of data-center
adapters and software part-owned by Oracle Corp., declined 6
percent to $26.48. The  Tel Aviv  shares retreated 2.7 percent to
106.40 shekels, or the equivalent of $29.76. The $3.27 discount
was the biggest among the largest Israeli companies traded in
New York.  Allot Communications Ltd. (ALLT) , Israel’s largest maker of high-
speed networking equipment, posted the biggest two-day drop on
record, tumbling 24 percent to $9.75. The company’s Tel Aviv
shares lost 6.6 percent to 43.04 shekels, or the equivalent of
$12.04.  Technology shares slumped following Hewlett-Packard Co.’s
21 percent drop after issuing forecasts that missed analysts’
estimates and announcing strategic shifts that undermined
confidence in the company’s management.  To contact the reporter on this story:
