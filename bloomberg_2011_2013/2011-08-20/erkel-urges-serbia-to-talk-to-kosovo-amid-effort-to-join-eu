German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
urged  Serbia  to restart talks with Kosovo as the country strives
to improve its chances of joining the European Union.  Merkel will use her visit to Serbia and  Croatia  in two days
to promote a peaceful solution to conflicts, a prerequisite to
joining the EU, the chancellor said today on a  video  on her
website.  Editor: Ross Larsen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
