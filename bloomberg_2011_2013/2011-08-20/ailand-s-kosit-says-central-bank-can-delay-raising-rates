Kosit Panpiemras, chairman of
 Bangkok Bank Pcl (BBL) ,  Thailand ’s largest lender, comments on
 interest rates . He spoke at an economic seminar in Bangkok
today.  Bank of Thailand will meet Aug. 24 to decide on the
nation’s key interest rate after eight increases in the past 13
months.  On global slowing:  “Now we have new information that the global economy is
slowing down. This will help reduce inflation pressure. So the
central bank can delay raising interest rates to wait and see
the situation. The current inflation level is something we need
to monitor, but I don’t think it has severely affected product
prices. Many Asian central banks have already slowed their rate
increases.  ‘‘The Thai economy in the second half will have good growth
momentum from the first half. Still, we need to monitor the
impact from the new government economic stimulus policies, which
may create more debts. I think economic growth this year should
be about 4 percent.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
