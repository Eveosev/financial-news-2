France Telecom SA (FTE) ’s Orange unit,
Bouygues Telecom SA and  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s SFR unit may stop offering
unlimited Internet access,  OWNI , which tracks blogs, websites,
and Internet content, said.  France’s Telecommunications Federation  is considering
making customers pay for Internet use after a certain number of
hours, OWNI said, citing a federation document it says it
obtained. The measure would allow better management of networks,
OWNI cited the document as saying.  France Telecom , Bouygues Telecom and SFR are members of the
federation, according to the industry group’s website.  “The fact that certain operators are considering offering
limited Internet access is no secret for anybody,” Le Monde
cited Yves Le Mouel, head of the federation, as saying in an
interview today. “But there is no consensus among operators,”
he said, adding that no decision has yet been made.  To contact the reporter on this story:
