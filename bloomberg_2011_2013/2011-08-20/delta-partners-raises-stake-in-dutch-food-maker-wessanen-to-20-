Private equity firm  Delta Partners
LLC  raised its stake in Royal Wessanen NV, the maker of Beckers
croquettes, to more than 20 percent.  The company’s holding in the Amsterdam-based organic food
company stood at 20.01 percent, according to an Aug. 16  filing 
published by Dutch financial markets regulator AFM today. Dutch
law requires investors to make a takeover offer when their stake
reaches 30 percent.  “We are in regular contact with Delta Partners as we are
with other shareholders,” Wessanen spokesman Carl Hoyer said by
telephone today. “It would be logical for them to believe in
our strategy, as we have set out a clear course.”  Delta Partners of Annapolis,  Maryland , first reported
having a 5.15 percent  stake  in Royal Wessanen in 2009. The
holding was raised to 16.33 percent in November 2010 from 10.03
percent in  March  that year. A call to Delta Partners seeking
comment wasn’t answered outside business hours.  Wessanen’s second-quarter net income dropped to 5.4 million
euros ($7.8 million) from 6.6 million euros a year earlier while
revenue rose 1.1 percent to 196 million euros. Wessanen shares
have fallen 8.6 percent this year.  Wessanen in July agreed to sell its Tree of Life U.K. unit
and its Kalisterra business in  France . The company last year
completed the sale of Tree of Life  North America  to Kehe Food
Distributors Inc. for $190 million to concentrate on its
European operations.  Investors in listed Dutch companies must announce the level
of their shareholdings after any sales or purchases that result
in their stakes crossing thresholds of 5 percent and any
additional 5 percent up to 30 percent. The thresholds come at
wider intervals above 30 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
