The German economy will probably
grow more than 3 percent this year as the auto, engineering and
chemical industries stay “strong,” Dieter Hundt, head of the
BDA employers’ association, told  Hamburger Abendblatt .  The number of unemployed may sink to less than 3 million
this year and go as low as 2.6 million in 2012 if the economy
remains stable, the German newspaper reported Hundt as saying.  Economic growth slowed to 0.1 percent in the second quarter
from 1.3 percent in the previous three months, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
