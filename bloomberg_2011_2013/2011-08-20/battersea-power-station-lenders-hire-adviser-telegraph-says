Lenders to the owner of Battersea
Power station appointed Ernst & Young LLP to advise on the
possible insolvency of the property firm, the Telegraph
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The Irish owner, Real Estate Opportunities, is seeking to
sell a 50 percent stake in the power station, to finance a 5.5
billion pound ($9.1 billion) regeneration project, the newspaper
said.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  is one of the lenders to the
property company, which faces Aug. 31 maturities on more than
400 million pounds of debt, according to the paper.  A number of offers have been received and final discussions
to conclude the deal are taking place, according to an
unidentified spokesman for Real Estate Opportunities cited by
the paper. Banks support the sale process and brought in Ernst &
Young to analyze offers, the paper said, citing people it didn’t
identify close to the property company. Lloyds declined to
comment, according to the paper.  A call made to Real Estate Opportunities investor relations
office today wasn’t answered.  -- Editors: Claudia Maedler, Heather Langan  To contact the reporter on this story:
