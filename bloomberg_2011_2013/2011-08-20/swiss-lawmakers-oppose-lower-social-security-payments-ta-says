Swiss lawmakers are against plans by
the country’s finance and economy ministers to lower social
security contributions for the export and tourism industries to
ease the burden caused by the Swiss franc’s strength,  Tages-
Anzeiger  reported.  Lawmakers from the Christian Democratic Party and the  Swiss
People’s Party  are opposed to the proposals, the newspaper said
today, citing Urs Schwaller, leader of the Christian Democratic
parliamentary party, and Toni Brunner, the Swiss People’s Party
president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
