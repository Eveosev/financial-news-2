England  declared on 591-6 after rain
wiped out most of the afternoon session on day three of the
final cricket Test against India.  Ian Bellâ€™s career-best 235 helped England reach its total
by the lunch break at the Oval in London. Play was then delayed
almost four hours by rain. Needing to take 20 wickets over the
final seven sessions to win, captain  Andrew Strauss  declared as
play resumed at 4:50 p.m. local time.  England leads the four-match series 3-0 and has guaranteed
its place as the No. 1 team in the International Cricket Council
Test rankings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
