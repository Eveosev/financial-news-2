Former New York Rangers captain
Chris Drury, who won a Little League  World Series  title, a
college hockey championship and a Stanley Cup trophy, has ended
a 12-year career with the  National Hockey League .  Drury, who turns 35 today, retired yesterday, the NHL
 Players’ Association  said in an e-mailed release. The decision
comes two months after the Rangers bought out the final year of
his five-year, $35 million contract, making him a free agent.  “Throughout his career, Chris Drury was always a great
competitor, a tremendous leader and teammate, and the heart and
soul type of player that every team would love to have,”
Rangers President and General Manager Glen Sather said in an e-
mail. “His commitment, determination and will to win were
apparent each and every day.”  Drury won the 1989 Little League World Series as a pitcher
for his hometown of Trumbull,  Connecticut , and six years later
won a National Collegiate Athletic Association hockey
championship as a freshman at  Boston University . He won the
Stanley Cup Final with the  Colorado Avalanche  in 2001.  In four seasons with the Rangers, Drury registered 62 goals
and 89 assists in 264 games. He also played for the  Buffalo
Sabres , Calgary Flames and Avalanche, totaling 255 career goals
and 360 assists.  Drury was limited by injury to 24 games with the Rangers
last season, with one goal and four assists.  Drury won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league’s rookie
of the year in 1999. He also won silver medals with the U.S.
hockey team in the 2002 and 2010 Winter Olympics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
