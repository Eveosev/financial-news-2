A threat by  Zimbabwe ’s
Indigenization Minister to cancel banking licenses held by
 Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  isn’t valid, central
bank governor Gideon Gono said, according to a report today in
the state-controlled  Herald .  Indigenization minister Saviour Kasukuwere yesterday gave
Barclays and Standard Chartered two weeks to show how they’d
dilute their shares, the Harare-based Herald said. Gono said
Kasukuwere didn’t have the legal authority to cancel banking
licenses as only the central bank regulates lenders, the Herald
said.  Kasukuwere’s statement had damaged Zimbabwe’s banking
sector by causing panic, the Herald quoted Gono as saying. Gono
said the central bank has no intention in the “foreseeable
future” to cancel licenses, though foreign-owned banks must
comply with the indigenization law, the Herald said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
