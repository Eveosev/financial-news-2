Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
said that medical exams conducted early today were “normal”
after his second round of chemotherapy for an undisclosed type
of cancer.  “My body continues positively assimilating the post-
chemotherapy treatment as it prepares for a possible new
round,” Chavez wrote in his “Notes from the Rearguard” column
sent via e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
