Embratel Participacoes SA, the
Brazilian phone company controlled by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, will buy a controlling stake in cable TV provider  Net
Servicos de Comunicacao SA (NETC4) , O Estado de S.Paulo newspaper
reported, citing Andre Borges, Net’s chief legal counsel.  Brazil’s Senate approved a bill Aug. 16 that allows
telephone carriers and foreign companies to offer cable
television in Brazil. The bill awaits the signature of President
Dilma Rousseff, whose administration has endorsed the measure.  Embratel, which already owns 49 percent of Net’s voting
shares, will buy an additional 2 percent stake as soon as
Rousseff signs the bill, Estado said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
