South Africa  beat New Zealand 18-5
for its first win in rugby’s Tri-Nations tournament.  Morne Steyn kicked five penalties and a drop goal to lead
world champion South Africa to the home win in Port Elizabeth.
The victory, which came in the Springboks’ final game, ended
their four-match winless in the southern hemisphere’s annual
championship going back to last year.  Richard Kahui scored a try for New Zealand. The All Blacks
and  Australia  are tied atop the standings with nine points and
will decide the title in the tournament's final game Aug. 27 in Brisbane.
South Africa finishes in last place with five points.  The teams are preparing for the  World Cup , which begins
next month in New Zealand. The All Blacks play the tournament’s
first game against Tonga on Sept. 9, while the Springboks open
their title defense two days laters against Wales.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
