Police in Washington, D.C., arrested
at least 65 people near the White House during a protest over a
proposed  TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  pipeline from Alberta to Texas, The
Hill newspaper reported.  Demonstrators are urging President  Barack Obama  to block
Transcanada’s $7 billion Keystone XL pipeline, which would
transport crude oil from the Alberta oil sands to refineries on
Texas’s Gulf Coast, the Hill said on its Web site. The project
needs State Department approval to proceed, the newspaper said.  Organizers say they expect 2,000 protesters over two weeks,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
