Increased taxes on higher-value
housing should not be brought in because home owners are already
paying enough, Eric Pickles, the U.K. Communities Secretary,
said in an interview with the  Daily Telegraph .  A so-called mansion tax, demanded by Liberal Democrat
members of the coalition government, would be “a big mistake,”
the paper quoted him as saying. The top rate of tax should also
be scrapped, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
