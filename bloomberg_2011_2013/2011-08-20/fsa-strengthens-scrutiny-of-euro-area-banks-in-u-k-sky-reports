The Financial Services Authority
increased scrutiny of “major” Euro-Area banks operating in the
U.K. on concern they may struggle to secure enough funding to
meet financial obligations amid declining stock markets, Sky
News reported on its website.  The U.K. regulator has been in daily conversations with
some of the largest banks, Sky reported, without saying where it
got the information. It’s also seeking more detailed and more
frequent information about the banks’ funding and liquidity
positions, the report said.  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA and  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) 
are among banks being closely monitored, according to the
report.  -- Editors: Claudia Maedler, Stephen Kirkland  To contact the reporter on this story:
