Brazil ’s government plans to lift a
ban on sales of alcoholic beverages at soccer games during the
2014 FIFA  World Cup , after receiving a request from the sport’s
governing body, Veja magazine reported, without saying where it
got the information.  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (BUD) , one of the event’s sponsors, would
have exclusive beer sales rights if the ban is lifted, Veja
