OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA,
the  oil company  controlled by billionaire Eike Batista, found
evidence of oil in an offshore well in Brazil’s Campos Basin.  The discovery was made at well 3OGX53DRJS in the BM-C-41
block at a water depth of 132 meters (433 feet), the National
Petroleum Agency said on its website. OGX, based in Rio de
Janeiro, hasn’t determined whether the discovery can be
developed commercially.  To contact the reporter on this story:
