Mario Moretti Polegato’s financial
holding company LIR Srl may consider making acquisitions in the
near future,  Il Sole 24 Ore  reported, citing Chief Executive
Officer Maurizio D’Angelo.  While there isn’t a dossier on the table, the company’s
liquidity allows it to be ready should growth opportunities
arise, D’Angelo was cited as saying by Il Sole.  LIR owns 71 percent of  Geox SpA (GEO) , the Italian shoemaker
founded by Polegato.  To contact the reporter on this story:
