The risks of  China ’s so-called
shadow banking system are controllable, China Citic Bank Corp.
Vice President Cao Tong said today, according to Caijing
magazine.  Regulators should control the amount of leverage allowed in
the system, Tong said in a report on the magazine’s website.
Market risk can spread quickly because shadow banks deal with
commercial banks as their counterparties and base prices on the
market, he said.
