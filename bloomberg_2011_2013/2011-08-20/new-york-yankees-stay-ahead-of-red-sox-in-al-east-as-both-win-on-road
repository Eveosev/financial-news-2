Russell Martin hit two home runs to
lead the  New York Yankees  to an 8-1 win over the Minnesota Twins

the Kansas City Royals 7-1.  Martin hit a solo home run in the third inning to tie the
game at 1-1, and then drove in Jorge Posada with a homer in the
sixth as the Yankees moved ahead 6-1. Mark Teixeira capped the
scoring in the ninth with a double that sent home  Derek Jeter 
and Curtis Granderson.  Trevor Plouffe hit a solo homer in the first inning for the
Twins’ only run at Target Field in Minneapolis.  Phil Hughes (4-4) allowed two hits and one run in 7 2/3
innings, while striking out two. Kevin Slowey (0-1) gave up six
runs on nine hits and struck out four batters in 5 2/3 innings.  At Kauffman Stadium in  Kansas City ,  Missouri , Boston’s
Darnell McDonald hit a triple to drive in Carl Crawford and tie
the score 1-1, and then reached home on a sacrifice fly by
Jacoby Ellsbury to give the Red Sox a 2-1 lead in the fourth
inning.  Jarrod Saltalamacchia hit a three-run homer in the fifth
while Ellsbury scored on Adrian Gonzalez’s sacrifice fly and
Mike Aviles scored on an error in the eighth inning.  The Yankees improved to 76-47, while the Red Sox stand at
