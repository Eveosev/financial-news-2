IHC Merwede B.V. , the Dutch builder
of dredgers and oil-rig support vessels, is in talks to acquire
a Southeast Asian shipyard because of lower wages and rising
energy exploration.  “We have to be more cost effective,” President Govert
Hamers told reporters yesterday in  Singapore . The company, which
aims to sign a deal by the end of June, has considered targets
in countries including Singapore and Vietnam, he said.  The closely held shipbuilder intends to add its first Asian
yard for offshore vessels as higher fuel prices spur drilling in
waters off  China , Malaysia, Vietnam and Australia. STX OSV
Holdings Ltd. and  Keppel Corp. (KEP)  are also expanding to meet demand
for vessels used to lay pipes and supply oil rigs following a
more-than 30 percent jump in the price of crude over the past
two years.  In  Brazil , IHC Merwede intends to seek sales by providing
technology and equipment to an existing shipyard rather than
opening its own facility, Hamers said, without naming the
partner.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s state-controlled oil
company, plans to have 37 platforms operating off the country’s
coast by 2015.  “In Brazil, we think it’s safer to be an equipment
supplier,” Hamers said. “We always find the best solution that
works well in that particular country.”  IHC Merwede, the world’s biggest builder of dredgers, has
five yards in Europe that make offshore and dredging vessels as
well as related equipment. The Sliedrecht, Holland-based company
also constructs dredgers at venture yards in India, Bangladesh
and China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
