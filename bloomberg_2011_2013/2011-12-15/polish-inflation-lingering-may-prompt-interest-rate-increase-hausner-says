Polish borrowing costs may rise if
the inflation rate takes longer to return to the central bank’s
target than policy makers expected, said  Jerzy Hausner , a member
of the rate-setting Monetary Policy Council.  “We’re fairly comfortable that we can make the inflation
target without increasing rates based on our most recent
projection, but if we stop feeling comfortable about hitting the
target, we’ll have to tighten,” Hausner said in a Dec. 13
interview in Warsaw, adding his preferred scenario would be to
leave rates unchanged next year.  Consumer prices rose 4.8 percent in November from a year
earlier, the fastest pace in six months, accelerating from 4.3
percent a month earlier. Inflation has been above the central
bank’s 2.5 percent target for 15 months. Policy makers raised
borrowing costs by a combined 1 percentage point in the first
half of 2011.  The  Narodowy Bank Polski  last month revised its inflation
outlook, published every fourth month, forecasting that its
target will be met in the second quarter 2013 rather than in
2012. Policy makers have kept the  benchmark seven-day rate  at
4.5 percent since July to avoid undermining  economic growth  as
the debt crisis of the euro area, Poland’s main trading partner,
hurts export demand.  ‘Can’t Just Ignore’  “The possibility of a rate increase is inherent in the
policy guidelines we’ve set for ourselves,” said Hausner.
“Price growth is above the target and its return to 2.5 percent
keeps getting delayed with each new forecast we produce. This is
something we can’t just ignore.”  The zloty has lost 12 percent against the euro in the
second half of the year, the worst performance among more than
170 currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It strengthened 0.6 percent
to 4.5301 as of 2:30 p.m. in Warsaw today.  The weaker zloty helps keep Polish products competitive
abroad. Net exports added 1 percentage point to GDP growth in
the third quarter as the Polish economy expanded by 4.2 percent.  The government cut its 2012 GDP forecast to 2.5 percent
from the earlier projected 4 percent, while the  International
Monetary Fund  reduced its estimate for next year to 2.5 percent
from 3 percent estimated in October.  “I don’t expect the economy to slow next year to such an
extent that we would be forced into monetary-policy easing,”
Hausner said.  Disciplined Budget Policy  Central bank Governor Marek Belka said Nov. 23 that more
disciplined budget policy would open the way for monetary
easing. The regulator will comment on the 2012 budget next week.  The Cabinet approved the draft budget last week, with a
general government deficit of 2.9 percent of gross domestic
product. The plan envisages more revenue from dividends of
state-owned companies, asset sales and mining taxes to
compensate for slower economic growth and will also increase the
disability levy paid by employers.  “Chances for reducing the general government gap to 3
percent of GDP next year are very low,” Hausner said. “It’s
good the government has adopted such a target but there’s no
need for such harsh fiscal tightening. It would be success to
narrow the gap by 1.5-2 percentage points.”  Poland wants to narrow this year’s  shortfall  to 5.6 percent
of GDP from 7.9 percent in 2010. It told the  European Commission 
it will meet EU deficit limits in 2012 to dodge budget scrutiny.  “If the deficit is trimmed by about 2 percentage points
this year from the very dangerous 7.9 percent, it would be
decent fiscal consolidation,” Hausner said. “The key is to
take another step forward on this path.”  Forward Agreements  Investors on the derivative market bet on a quarter
percentage-point rate cut by September as the gap between nine-
month forward rate-agreements and three-month  Warsaw Interbank
Rate  is at almost 30 basis points.  Economists including Magdalena Polan of Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Peter Attard Montalto of Nomura Intl. Plc, expect
borrowing costs to rise in 2012 if a weaker zloty boosts import
prices further. The Monetary Policy Council reiterated Dec. 7
that it may adjust rates if the inflation outlook worsens.  “We can’t disregard the currency’s exchange rate as its
heavy weakening makes running monetary policy difficult and
could encourage us to a rate hike,” Hausner said. “While
inflation is driven by external shocks and the zloty isn’t a
reason behind it but rather a transmission channel, we need to
keep it from making inflation permanent on the internal side and
triggering a price-wage spiral.”  Import Price Effect  More than 80 percent of  Poland ’s inflation growth in the
last two months came from the costs of imported goods or
products with imported components, according to Tomasz Kaczor,
chief economist at the state-owned Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego,
known as BGK.  The Narodowy Bank Polski has sold foreign currencies to
prop up the zloty four times. Central banker Elzbieta Chojna- Duch said today that an interest-rate change wouldn’t affect the
currency or curb inflation.  “Our interventions aren’t driven directly by concern over
inflation” and “it isn’t about replacing one policy tool with
another as they should complement one another,” Hausner said.
“We don’t have the capability to nudge the zloty to a
fundamental equilibrium rate. The central bank wants to signal
to investors taking advantage of this gap and speculating that
they need to be aware of the risk.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
