Hungary will consider the  European
Central Bank ’s opinion on the country’s draft central bank law
“with due seriousness,” Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said.  Orban hasn’t read the ECB’s opinion yet, he told reporters
in Budapest today. Comments by central bank President Andras
Simor on the central bank law were “political provocation,”
Orban added.  Orban is seeking a “total takeover” of the central bank,
Simor told the news website Index in an interview published
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
