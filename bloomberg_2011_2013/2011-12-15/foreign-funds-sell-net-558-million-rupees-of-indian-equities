Overseas  investors  sold a net  558
million rupees  ($10.4 million) of Indian stocks yesterday,
increasing their withdrawals from the equities this year to 17.3
billion rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners bought 23 billion rupees of shares and sold 23.6
billion rupees, the Securities and Exchange Board of  India  said
 today . They bought a net 8.06 billion rupees of bonds, taking
total flows into debt this year to 368.9 billion rupees.  The  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  has dropped 23 percent this
year, on concern a slowdown in the U.S. and  Europe ’s debt crisis
may erode company profits already threatened by the most
aggressive interest-rate increases among major Asian economies.  India’s $1.2 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fourth-biggest,
is influenced by foreign fund flows. Inflows from abroad surged
to a record $29.4 billion in 2010, making the Sensex the best
performer among the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever
outflow in 2008 led to the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Foreign  funds  have placed 4.454 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.156 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
