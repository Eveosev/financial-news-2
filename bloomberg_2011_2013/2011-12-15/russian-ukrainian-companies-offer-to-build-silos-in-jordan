Russian and Ukrainian companies
offered to build silos in  Jordan  for regional reserves and to
help the Jordanian government plant wheat, according to Petra,
the countryâ€™s news agency.  An unidentified Russian company offered to build a silo
with a storage capacity of 6 million metric tons and an
unidentified Ukrainian company proposed building a 2 million
metric ton silo in the country, the agency said, citing Sami
Qammouh, minister of industry and trade.  The country can store 450,000 tons of grain and its storage
capacity will increase to 550,000 tons after the ongoing
expansion of a silo north of the capital Amman is completed,
Petra said, citing Hassan Saoudi, director general of the Jordan
Silos and Supply General Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
