The cost of goods leaving South
African factories and mines rose at a slower pace in November
than a month earlier, giving the central bank room to leave
 interest rates  unchanged.  The producer-price  inflation  rate fell to 10.1 percent from
10.6 percent in October, the first decline in seven months,
Pretoria-based Statistics South  Africa  said on its website
today. The median estimate of 14 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was 10.6 percent. Prices rose 0.2 percent in the
month.  The  Reserve Bank  has kept its benchmark lending  rate 
unchanged at a 30-year low of 5.5 percent this year to support
growth in Africa’s biggest economy, even as price pressures
increased. Growth stalled at 1.4 percent in the third quarter,
little changed from the almost two-year low of 1.3 percent in
the previous three months.  “With domestic growth under threat, the Reserve Bank will
probably opt to keep interest rates unchanged until the end of
2012,” Nedbank Group Ltd.,  South Africa ’s fourth-largest
lender, said in a note to clients. While lower commodity prices
and weakening demand should contain producer prices in 2012,
further depreciation in the value of the rand will keep factory
inflation “firmly in double-digit territory next year,” it
said.  Consumer-price inflation climbed to 6.1 percent in November
to breach the top end of the central bank’s 3 percent to 6
percent target range for the first time in 22 months, as higher
fuel prices and a weaker rand boosted costs.  The rand has slumped 21 percent against the dollar this
year, the most of 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It
strengthened 0.4 percent to 8.4038 per dollar as of 1:55 p.m. in
Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
