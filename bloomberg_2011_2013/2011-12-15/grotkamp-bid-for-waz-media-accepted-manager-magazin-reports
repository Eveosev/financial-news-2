Petra Grotkamp’s 470 million-euro
($613 million) offer for full control of her family’s WAZ Media
Group has been accepted,  Manager Magazin  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  WAZ is 50 percent owned by the Funke family, of which
Grotkamp is a member, and 50 percent by the Brost family, the
German magazine said. Peter Heinemann, who administers the Brost
family’s holding, has approved the bid that was submitted in
August, Manager Magazin said.  The Funke family will meet tomorrow to discuss final
details regarding the takeover, including a 50 million-euro
funding gap, Manager Magazin reported.  Axel Springer AG  Chief Executive Officer Mathias Doepfner
said last month he would be interested in “superbrands that
have a lot of potential for digitalization,” such as WAZ’s
stake in Austrian tabloid Neue Kronen Zeitung.  To contact the reporter on this story:
