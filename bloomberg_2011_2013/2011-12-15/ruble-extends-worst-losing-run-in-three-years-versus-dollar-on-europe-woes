The ruble weakened for an 11th day
against the dollar as concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will hobble
the global economic recovery intensified, curbing investor
appetite for riskier assets.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 31.8575 as
of 2:54 p.m. in Moscow, extending its worst losing streak since
January 2009 and heading for the lowest closing level since Oct.
7. The ruble was 0.2 percent weaker at 41.43 versus the euro,
leaving it down 0.2 percent at 36.1651 against the central
bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Plans to create a closer European fiscal union have failed
to reassure investors, sending  Italy ’s five-year bond yield to a
14-year high at an auction yesterday. Oil, Russia’s chief export
earner, climbed 99 cents to $95.94 a barrel after retreating 5.2
percent to a five-week low yesterday.  Investors increased bets the Russian currency will weaken
further, with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at
32.3018 per dollar in three months, compared with expectations
of 32.3575 per dollar yesterday.  Russia ’s dollar-denominated Eurobond due in 2020 rose,
decreasing the yield seven basis points to 4.558 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
