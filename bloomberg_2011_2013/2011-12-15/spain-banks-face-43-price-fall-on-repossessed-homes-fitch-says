Repossessed houses in  Spain  are
worth 43 percent less on average than the valuations assigned on
the mortgages for the properties, according to  Fitch Ratings .  Price declines range from 20 percent to 58 percent,
analysts Juan David Garcia and Carlos Masip in Madrid wrote in a
report analyzing 8,235 properties funded by loans from banks
including  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  and  Bankia SA . The mortgages are in
asset-backed securities with high loan-to-value ratios.  “Fitch does not expect lending to recover in 2012, as
financial institutions are more focused on optimising their
balance sheets, while their access to funding is limited,”  the
analyst wrote. “Lending is likely to remain concentrated on
existing high-quality borrowers and on potential buyers of
banks’ repossessed properties.”  The impact of falling house prices on mortgage-backed
securities has been cushioned by some banks that bought
defaulted loans from the deals at above-market prices, Fitch
said. That support will wane as lender liquidity dries up.  Spanish home prices fell for the 14th consecutive quarter
as unemployment surged and a drop in mortgage lending crimped
demand for property. The average price of houses and apartments
dropped 7.4 percent in three months ended Sept. 30 from the same
period a year earlier, according to the National Statistics
Institute in  Madrid .  To contact the reporter on this story:
