What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 6 cents to 8 cents a bushel higher

States Commodities Inc. in Kansas City, Missouri, said in a
telephone interview. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open
0.2 cent to 0.3 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal futures
