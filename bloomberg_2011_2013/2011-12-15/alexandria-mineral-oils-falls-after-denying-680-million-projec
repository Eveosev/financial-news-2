Alexandria Mineral Oils Co. (AMOC)  headed
for the biggest decline since Nov. 21 after the petroleum
products producer denied a report in Al Mal newspaper that it
may embark on a $680 million project.  The shares tumbled 2.1 percent to 68.13 Egyptian pounds at
1:17 p.m.  Egypt ’s benchmark EGX 30 Index fell 0.1 percent.  The report is “incorrect,” the company known as Amoc said
in a regulatory filing to the Egyptian Exchange after the market
closed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
