Gasoline in the  Gulf Coast  rose to
the highest level in more than a month on speculation of greater
demand for the motor fuel during the holiday season.  “Holiday demand is always a bit higher and maybe in
anticipation of some January maintenance” prices for gasoline
have increased,  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates
LLC in Houston, said in a telephone interview.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast  narrowed 1.38 cents to 4.25 cents versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:01 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It is the highest level
since Nov. 9. Prompt delivery slipped 0.23 cent to $2.4452 a
gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
