Asia  fuel oil ’s discount to crude
widened, signaling losses for refiners turning oil into residual
products. Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought gasoline for a second day
in Singapore, the region’s biggest oil-trading center.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Asian marker Dubai crude widened 54
cents to $6.01 a barrel at 3:20 p.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The gap has increased 9.1
percent so far this week.  The premium of  180-centistoke  fuel oil to  380-centistoke 
grade fell 50 cents to $12 a metric ton, PVM said. A narrowing
 viscosity spread  means bunker, or marine fuel, declined less
than higher-quality fuel oil.  Light Distillates  Naphtha ’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures slid
$6.48 to $109.80 a ton at 5:30 p.m.  Singapore  time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread, a measure of
profit from making the petrochemical feedstock, yesterday was
the widest since September.  Shell bought 50,000 barrels of  95-RON gasoline  from Total
SA, paying $112.95 a barrel to load from Jan. 2 to Jan. 6,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders monitoring
transactions on the Platts window.  Europe ’s largest oil company
has purchased at least 300,000 barrels of this grade so far this
month, the most among buyers in Singapore.  BP Plc sold a similar-sized gasoline cargo to
ConocoPhillips, receiving $113.05 a barrel for Jan. 1 to Jan. 5
loading, the survey showed.  Middle Distillates  The premium  gasoil , or diesel, to Dubai crude dropped 64
cents to $17.86 a barrel at 3:20 p.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM. This  crack spread  gave up all of yesterday’s gains.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil decreased 5 cents to 75 cents
a barrel, PVM data showed. This  regrade  is the lowest so far
this week, indicating it is less profitable to produce  aviation
fuel  over diesel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
