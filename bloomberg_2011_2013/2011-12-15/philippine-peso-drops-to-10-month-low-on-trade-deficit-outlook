The Philippine peso traded near a
10-month low on speculation the nation’s trade deficit will
worsen as exports slow amid  Europe ’s debt crisis. Bonds advanced.  Overseas workers’  remittances,  which account for 10 percent
of the  Philippines ’ $200 billion economy, increased at a slower
pace in October, rising 6.2 percent from a year earlier,
compared with an increase of 8.4 percent the previous month, the
central bank said today. The  trade gap  widened to $1.2 billion
in September from $803 million the previous month, government
data showed on Nov. 25.  “The overall focus of traders here is what’s happening in
the European Union and the possible impact it will have on Asian
growth,” said Joey Cuyegkeng, an economist at ING Groep NV in
Manila. The trade deficit is likely to widen in the coming
months, he said.  The peso traded at 44.115 per dollar at the close in  Manila ,
compared with 44.140 yesterday, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.
The currency touched 44.323 earlier, the weakest level since Jan.
31. It has lost 1.1 percent this week.  Philippine exports fell in October for a sixth month,
declining 14.6 percent from a year earlier, the statistics
office said on Dec. 13.  The yield on the government’s 5.75 percent notes due
November 2021 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point,
to 5.72 percent, according to the midday fixing prices from the
Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp.  The central bank approved the government’s plan to sell as
much as $1.5 billion of global bonds, a government official said,
declining to be identified as the information isn’t public yet.
The government plans to sell 10- and 25-year dollar-denominated
debt, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
