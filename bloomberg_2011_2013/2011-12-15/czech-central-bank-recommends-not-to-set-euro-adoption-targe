The Czech central bank and the
 Finance Ministry  jointly recommended that the government hold
off on setting a target date for adopting the euro for now, the
bank said today in a statement on its website.  Prime Minister Petr Necas has repeatedly said his Cabinet
wonâ€™t set a target for joining the euro region. The bank and the
ministry also recommended the government not try to join the
exchange-rate mechanism ERM2 next year, the Prague-based Ceska
Narodni Banka said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
