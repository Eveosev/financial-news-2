KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , Poland’s sole
copper producer, may pay about 3 billion zloty ($864 million) as
a dividend from 2011 profit, Chief Executive Officer  Herbert Wirth  told Reuters in an interview.  KGHM doesn’t exclude raising its 2011 net income forecast
of 9.64 billion zloty, Wirth said, according to Reuters. The CEO
added that the 3 billion-zloty proposed buyback is an option
that may or may not to be used next year, Reuters said.  Wirth declined to comment on the Polish government’s
detailed proposals of a new copper tax released today, Reuters
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
