Hungary’s government will recreate a
separate  finance ministry  after merging it into the economy
portfolio last year,  Magyar Hirlap  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Mihaly Varga will be picked to lead the finance ministry
“in all probability,” the newspaper said, adding that Varga
served as finance minister in an earlier government headed by
Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  and is now a state secretary leading
Orban’s office.  Gergely Domonkos Horvath, who is chairman of the national
postal service and a director at the state asset management
company, may replace Tamas Fellegi, who offered to resign as
development minister last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
