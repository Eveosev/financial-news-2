New China Life Insurance Co. , the
nation’s third-largest life insurer, fell in its  Hong Kong 
trading debut after selling stock near the bottom of a marketed
range in its $1.9 billion initial share offering.  The  stock  dropped 9.8 percent to HK$25.70 at the close in
Hong Kong. The Beijing-based company sold 358.4 million shares
at HK$28.50 each in Hong Kong and 158.5 million shares at 23.25
yuan apiece in  Shanghai , where it will start trading tomorrow.
The benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  declined 1.8 percent.  New China Life is raising more equity after its expansion
in a market that has grown an average 30 percent a year during
the past three decades brought its solvency ratio, a gauge of
its ability to settle claims, below regulatory requirements.
Chinese life insurers’ capital strength may weaken further as
stocks declines amid an economic slowdown crimp profitability,
 Fitch Ratings  said in an e-mailed report on Dec. 7.  “New China Life shares will likely remain flat in the near
term given the weak market sentiment,” said Olive Xia, a
Shanghai-based analyst at Core Pacific-Yamaichi International
Ltd. “The company depends on bancassurance most among the big
insurers, which is also a risk and may be part of the reason for
its low valuation relative to  China  Life.”  Shares of China Life Insurance Co. and Ping An Insurance
(Group) Co., the nation’s biggest insurance companies, have
tumbled more than 30 percent this year. China’s benchmark
Shanghai Composite Index and the Hang Seng retreated 22 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
