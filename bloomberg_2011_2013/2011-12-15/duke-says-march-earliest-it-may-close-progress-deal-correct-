(Corrects city where Duke Energy is based in first
paragraph.)  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  says March is the
earliest it may close a deal to buy  Progress Energy Inc. (PGN)  after
U.S. regulators questioned a plan it put forth to mitigate
competition concerns, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based
company said in a statement today.  Duke had said it expected federal and state regulatory
approvals in time to close the takeover by Jan. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
