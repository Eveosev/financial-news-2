Six in 10 Greeks say elections
should be held by Feb. 19, a date tentatively set during
government-formation talks last month, an opinion poll showed.  Of the 2,000 people questioned Dec. 1-8 by MRB, 26.7
percent said elections should be held right away while 34
percent said they should happen by Feb. 19. The poll was
published on the website of  Proto Thema  newspaper today.  Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos ’s interim government
hasn’t set a date for elections and will adopt more fiscal
measures if it’s in the country’s best interest, Minister of
State George Stavropoulos told reporters yesterday.  Papademos, appointed on Nov. 11 as head of a government
backed by three of the five parliamentary parties, is trying to
meet a three-month deadline to secure loans under a 130 billion-
euro ($169 billion) bailout for  Greece  agreed to by European
Union leaders on Oct. 26.  More than half of those polled, 55.1 percent, had a
negative opinion of the interim government while 60.1 percent
said it would fail to meet its goals.  If an election were held now, the  Pasok  party of former
Prime Minister  George Papandreou  would garner the support of
15.1 percent of likely voters while the  New Democracy Party , led
by Antonis Samaras, would be the choice of 26 percent. The
nationalist Laos party, which is also part of the interim
government along with Pasok and  New Democracy , was backed by 6.2
percent.  The  Communist Party of Greece  would receive 11.6 percent of
the vote and the Coalition of the Radical Left, or  Syriza , would
get 7.4 percent, the poll suggested. Both Syriza and the
Communist Party declined to join the interim government. The
survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.1 percentage
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
