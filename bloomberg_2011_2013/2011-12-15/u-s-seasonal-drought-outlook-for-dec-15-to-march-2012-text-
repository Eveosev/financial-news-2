Following is the text of the U.S.
 Seasonal Drought Outlook  as released by the  National Weather
Service  in Camp Springs, Maryland:  Latest Seasonal Assessment - The drought outlook for December
15, 2011 - March 31, 2012 was based upon climate anomalies
associated with La Ni単a, short to medium range forecasts,
climatology, and initial conditions. Persistence or development
can be expected across much of the Southeast with the highest
forecast confidence in Florida. However, the prospects for
improvement increase closer to the southern Appalachians. Since
early November, frequent precipitation and seasonably cooler
temperatures resulted in drought improvement across the southern
Plains. Additional improvement can be expected in southeast
Kansas, eastern Oklahoma, and northeast  Texas , while monthly and
seasonal precipitation forecasts favor persistence across the
remainder of Texas and the southern high Plains. Despite the
early winter snowfall in Arizona and  New Mexico , La Ni単a
elevates the odds for drought persistence across the Southwest.
Drought development is forecast for parts of  California 
associated with a dry La Ni単a signal, and development potential
extends north into the southern Sierras due to a lack of early
winter snowfall. A relatively dry winter climatology elevates
the chances for persistence across the western Corn Belt and
upper Mississippi Valley. Drought improvement is forecast for
Hawaii which is consistent with a La Ni単a winter.  SOURCE: National Weather Service  To contact the reporter on this story:
