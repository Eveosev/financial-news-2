A Brazilian lawsuit that seeks to
halt  Transocean Ltd. (RIG)  and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  operations after an  oil
spill  would reduce the country’s offshore drilling at a time
when it wants to double output in ten years.  Federal prosecutors in Campos, in the oil region of Rio de
Janeiro state, are suing both companies for 20 billion reais
($10.6 billion) in environmental and social damages and asked a
court to suspend their operations, according to a statement
yesterday. Chevron, based in  San Ramon ,  California , and 
Transocean, based in Vernier,  Switzerland , said they haven’t 
been notified and are cooperating with authorities.  The case imperils Brazil’s plan to boost crude output
because Transocean operates 10 out of the 61 rigs working in the
country and it would be hard to replace them in a tight market
for oil equipment, said Judson Bailey, an analyst at Jefferies &
Co Inc. Brazilian oil production growth has slowed after the
country increased safety requirements following the spill at  BP
Plc ’s Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico last year.  “The rig market is pretty tight, so if Transocean were
banned, the  oil companies  wouldn’t be happy at all,” Bailey
said in a phone interview from Houston. “Chevron and Petrobras
can’t get a rig elsewhere, so it messes with the state-owned  oil
company .”  Chevron, Brazil’s third-largest producer behind state-
controlled  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  and Royal Dutch Shell Plc,
will see production wane in Brazil until the government lets it
drill again, said Cleveland Jones, an oil specialist and
professor at Rio de Janeiro State University.  ‘Opening Shot’  Chevron fell 3 percent to $100.53 at the close in  New York 
yesterday. Transocean declined 3.9 percent to $40.19.  Chevron has come under increased scrutiny in Brazil after
3,000 barrels of oil leaked last month from an oil field in deep
waters of the Campos Basin. The company underestimated the
amount of pressure at an oil deposit it was exploring, and crude
leaked from the reservoir for about eight days, George Buck, the
head of Chevron for Brazil, said on Nov. 20.  BP has booked more than $40 billion in losses related to the
April 2010 blowout of the Macondo well in the  Gulf of Mexico .
The accident killed 11 workers aboard Transocean’s Deepwater
Horizon well and spilled 4.9 million barrels of crude. That’s
about $8,163 per barrel spilled, compared to $3.57 million per
barrel if the Brazilian fine were to hold.  Still Operating  “Ultimately this is an opening shot, Chevron’s attorneys
are probably not at all fazed by this,” said Jones. “The
prosecutor’s office will be a positive development for Chevron,
because they will ensure that the letter of the law is followed
and the letter of the law is reasonable.”  Chevron said in an e-mailed statement that it “responded
responsibly to the incident at its Frade Field and has dealt
transparently with all Brazilian authorities.”  Guy Cantwell , a
Transocean spokesman, said the company’s rigs are operating in
Brazilian waters and the company continues to cooperate with the
government.  Chevron holds a 51.74 percent stake in Frade. Petrobras
holds a 30 percent stake, and Frade Japao Petroleo Ltda., a
joint venture including Inpex Corp. and Sojitz Corp, holds 18.26
percent. Frade is about 230 miles (370 kilometers) northeast of
 Rio de Janeiro  in the Campos Basin and produced 76,000 barrels a
day of oil and natural gas in October.  Criminal Lawsuit  In the next few weeks, prosecutors will probably file a
criminal lawsuit against Chevron for alleged environmental crime,
said Romulo Sampaio, a law professor at Brazil’s Getulio Vargas
Foundation.  “In this case, everything conspires against the company:
it’s a foreign company, drilling for oil in Brazilian waters.
That may bring about emotional responses,” Sampaio, who
coordinates the university’s Environmental Law program, said in
a telephone interview.  Prosecutors’ track record in lawsuits against companies
involving environmental issues has been at best mixed. Federal
prosecutors twice this year sought to halt construction of the
Belo Monte hydroelectric dam in the Amazon, and on both
occasions federal judges ruled that the project should proceed.  Federal prosecutors in 2009 convinced Brazilian cattle
ranchers in Para, the state that has lost the most forestland to
illegal logging, to halt Amazon forest destruction and replant
trees to avoid an international ban on meat after prosecutors
took action.  Brazil ’s five largest meatpackers -- JBS SA, the world’s
largest beef producer, Marfrig Alimentos SA, Bertin SA, Minerva
SA and Frigol Comercial Ltda. -- agreed to stop buying cattle
from suppliers that contributed to stripping the Amazon forest.  A lawsuit against Alcoa Inc. is still pending after six
years of legal haggling. Federal and state prosecutors sued
Alcoa’s Brazilian mining subsidiary in 2005 in an effort to
block construction of the Juruti bauxite mine in the state of
Para, saying the company had circumvented the law by not
applying for a federal permit and instead seeking a license from
the state of Para.  To contact the reporters on this story:
