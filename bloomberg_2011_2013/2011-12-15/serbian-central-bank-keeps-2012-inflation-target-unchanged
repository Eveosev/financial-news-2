Serbia ’s central bank will keep its
inflation target intact for 2012, aiming to steer consumer
prices toward 4 percent by the end of next year, it said in a
monetary policy program today.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije will aim to reduce
the inflation rate toward 4 percent plus or minus 1.5 percentage
points by the end of 2012, from 4.5 percent plus or minus 1.5
percentage points at the start of the year.  Inflation stood at 8.1 percent in November, down from a
14.7 percent peak in April.  As part of inflation targeting policy framework, the
central bank will continue to use its  benchmark interest rate  as
the key policy instrument and will “change it in a consistent
and transparent way,” the bank said on its website.  The dinar will remain subject to a managed-float system,
with any market interventions organized only if there’s the need
to slow “excessive daily oscillations” or maintain stability
of the financial system, it said.  -- Editor: James M. Gomez  To contact the reporter on this story:
