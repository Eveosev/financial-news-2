The European DataWarehouse, a
European Central Bank-endorsed project to collect information on
asset-backed securities, is seeking as much as 20 million euros
($26 million) from a share sale.  ED will offer stock to ABS market participants in January,
said Paul Burdell, the London-based chief executive officer of
Link Financial Ltd., the project’s adviser. The cash will get ED
started and cover about three years of running costs.  The ECB in  Frankfurt  intends to make loan-level data part
of the requirement for accepting asset-backed securities as
collateral for financing. Sapient Global Markets was mandated in
November to build ED’s system, and Perella Weinberg Partners
will manage the share sale.  Banks create asset-backed securities by pooling consumer
and property loans into notes, which typically allow lenders to
raise capital more cheaply than by issuing unsecured debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
