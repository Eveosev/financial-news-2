Sapporo Holdings Ltd. (2501) ,  Japan ’s
fourth-largest brewer by volume, intends to increase beer
production as much as fivefold in  Vietnam  by 2019 as a shrinking
population at home crimps demand.  Sapporo, which started brewing beer in Vietnam last month,
plans to boost annual output to as much as 200,000 kiloliters
(52.8 million gallons) from 40,000 kiloliters in 2014, Yoshiyuki Mochida, president of Sapporo International, said in an
interview yesterday in  Tokyo .  Japan’s biggest brewers including  Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. (2502) 
and  Kirin Holdings Co. (2503)  plan acquisitions across Southeast Asia
to access wider margins after beer shipments slumped in 2010 for
a 14th consecutive year. Sapporo will compete with them in
Vietnam, where the government estimates that demand for beer
will more than double by 2020.  “Vietnam’s business environment is such that you have to
knock the competition out before they do,” Mochida said. “If
you fall asleep there, your head will be lopped off.”  Asahi Group has identified targets in  Southeast Asia ,
President Naoki Izumiya said in an interview on Dec. 12. Kirin
will “consider corporate tie-ups and small-scale mergers and
acquisitions” in the region, Chief Executive Officer Senji Miyake said Dec. 13.  Shares of Sapporo have declined 19 percent this year, equal
to the 19 percent slide for the broader Topix index. Asahi has
risen 6.7 percent and Kirin has fallen 18 percent.  Second Factory  Sapporo, maker of premium brands such as Yebisu, may decide
to open a second factory in Hanoi in 2014, Mochida said.
Consumption in Vietnam is forecast to overtake that in Japan by
2020 if current trends continue, he said.  The Southeast Asian nation had a population of 89.6 million
at the end of last year and is forecast by the U.S. Census
Bureau to increase to 93.4 million by 2014, according to
Bloomberg data. Japan had 126.8 million people and is forecast
to drop to 125.2 million by 2014, the data shows.  Demand for beer in Vietnam is expected to rise to 5.8
million kiloliters by 2020 from 2.6 million kiloliters last
year, according to the nation’s ministry of industry and trade.  “The beer market for Vietnam is huge and will overtake
Japan,” said  Hiroshi Saji , a Tokyo-based analyst for Mizuho
Securities Co. who recommends buying Sapporo shares. “But the
first order of the day is to turn a profit for their overseas
operations.”  Operating Margins  The push into the region will give the brewers access to
markets where some rivals’ operating margins are more than
double those of Asahi, Kirin and Sapporo.  Sapporo’s operating margin of 7.13 percent compares with
26.74 percent for the Philippines’  San Miguel Brewery Inc. (SMB)  and
22.47 percent for PT Multi Bintang  Indonesia , according to the
latest quarterly figures compiled by Bloomberg. Asahi’s
operating margin was 9.73 percent and Kirin had a margin of
8.61 percent.  Malaysia’s Guinness Anchor Bhd. has an operating margin of
16.27 percent while  Thai Beverage Pcl. (THBEV) ’s was 12.14 percent in
the most recent quarter.  San Miguel Brewery, a unit of the Philippines’ biggest
company by sales that dominates the country’s beer market, is
48 percent owned by Kirin, which has been investing in the
Southeast Asian country for at least a decade.  Sapporo also plans to expand in  Thailand , where it will
build brand awareness through Japanese restaurants, Mochida
said. It may look for local partners to grow in that country,
he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
