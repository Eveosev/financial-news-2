U.S. stocks pared gains and the euro
erased its advance as the head of the  International Monetary
Fund  said the European debt crisis is escalating to the point
that it will not be solved by one group of countries.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent to
1,216.82 at 11:02 a.m. in New York after climbing as much as 1.1
percent earlier. The euro was 0.2 percent higher at $1.3003
after strengthening more than 0.5 percent. Treasuries erased
most of their earlier losses, with the 10-year yield little
changed at 1.91 percent.  IMF Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said at an event in
Washington that the “crisis is not only unfolding, but
escalating" and cannot be resolved by one group of countries.
Stocks and the euro rallied earlier after data on jobless claims
and manufacturing signaled a strengthening U.S. economy and
 Spain  sold almost twice as much debt as targeted at an auction.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
