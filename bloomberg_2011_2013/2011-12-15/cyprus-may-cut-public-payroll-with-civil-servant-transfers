Cyprus’s parliament passed a law
yesterday aimed at curbing the country’s rising public wage bill
by allowing the transfer of civil servants from one ministry or
department to another.  “There are many cases of government departments that hired
staff to carry out projects for whom they have no use any
more”, economist and former undersecretary Symeon Matsis, who
advises the  Cyprus Chamber of Commerce and Industry , said in a
telephone interview. These people would then remain in position
and would not be transferred, he said.  Overall public-sector personnel costs of the euro area’s
third smallest economy are projected to rise to 2.7 billion
euros ($3.5 billion) in 2011, a 25 percent increase from 2008,
according to the  finance ministry . The new law is part of an
approved fiscal consolidation package worth 855 million euros
over three years.  The key for Cyprus’s fiscal consolidation is the cost of
its public sector, Marinos Gialeli, general manager of the  Hotel
Employees Provident Fund , said in an interview today. He said
the the introduction of transferability and a two-year wage
freeze in the public sector also passed by the parliament
wouldn’t be enough on their own.  As long as salaries of civil servants are not linked to
performance, they can neither be evaluated nor fired; the source
of Cyprus’s fiscal problems lies in a lack of proper human
resource management in the government sector, said Gialeli, who
manages assets worth 271 million euros.  “Unless we introduce proper management to the public
sector we shall have a problem down the road again, even if
 Europe  overcomes its debt crisis,” Gialeli said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
