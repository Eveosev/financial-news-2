Ukraine’s sunflower oil production
rose 17 percent to a record 346,000 metric tons in November
compared with a year ago, researcher UkrAgroConsult said.  Sunflower oil output in the three months from September
through November rose by 21 percent to 917,000 tons, Kiev-based
UkrAgroConsult said in an e-mailed statement today. Last month’s
production was 8,000 tons more than in October, it said.  The researcher increased its sunflower seed harvest
estimate to 9.2 million tons from 8.9 million tons after yields
rose, according to the statement.  Ukraine will probably plant less sunflower and more
soybeans in the next few years, according to Ukroliyaprom group,
which represents Ukrainian oilseed producers. Sunflower
plantings probably won’t rise because plentiful supplies in the
country and  Russia  caused prices to fall this year, Stepan Kapshuk, the group’s president, said in a phone interview from
Kiev yesterday.  Ukraine may harvest between 7.5 million to 8 million tons of
sunflower seed by 2015 as the soybean crop climbs to 5 million
tons from 2.3 million tons this year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
