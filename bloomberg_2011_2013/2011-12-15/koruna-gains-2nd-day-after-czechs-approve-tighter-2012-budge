The koruna strengthened for a second
day after the government approved a budget for 2012, endorsing a
22 percent deficit reduction.  The Czech currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 25.598 per
euro by 11:02 a.m. in  Prague , paring the koruna’s losses so far
this quarter to 3.6 percent.  The budget law, passed late yesterday, is part of Premier
Petr Necas’s plan to trim the fiscal gap after assembling the
largest majority in parliament since independence in 1993. The
pledge to reduce the shortfall to less than the European Union
limit of 3 percent of economic output has helped the Czech
koruna outperform currencies in Poland and  Hungary  this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
