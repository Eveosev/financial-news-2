Brazil ’s central bank closed a
loophole that allowed foreigners to circumvent the so-called IOF
tax on financial transactions.  Foreign buyers of untaxed debentures will need to carry out
another foreign exchange operation, and pay the 6 percent tax,
if they sell the securities and switch to other assets on which
it is levied, the central bank said in an e-mailed statement.  Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  eliminated the IOF tax on
local corporate bonds with a duration of more than four years
this month as one of a series of stimulus measures designed to
prop up growth in  Latin America ’s largest economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
