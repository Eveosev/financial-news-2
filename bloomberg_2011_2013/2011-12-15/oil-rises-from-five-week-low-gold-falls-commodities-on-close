The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities rose 1.4 percent to 623.34 as of 5:49 p.m. in
 Singapore . The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials rose
1.8 percent to 1,468.76.  CRUDE OIL  Oil advanced from a five-week low in New York as investors
bought back contracts on speculation yesterday’s drop, the
biggest since September, was exaggerated.  West Texas Intermediate futures gained as much as 1 percent
after nearing the 50-day moving average of about $94.24 a barrel,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Buy orders tend to be
clustered near chart-support levels. Oil fell yesterday after
OPEC raised its output ceiling and  Europe ’s debt crisis worsened,
threatening a recession that may curb demand for commodities.  NATURAL GAS  OIL PRODUCTS  Fuel oil’s discount to Asian marker Dubai crude widened 54
cents to $6.01 a barrel at 3:20 p.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The gap has increased 9.1
percent so far this week.  The premium of 180-centistoke  fuel oil  to 380-centistoke
grade fell 50 cents to $12 a metric ton, PVM said. A narrowing
viscosity spread means bunker, or marine fuel, declined less
than higher-quality fuel oil.
Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures slid
$6.48 to $109.80 a ton at 5:30 p.m. Singapore time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread, a measure of
profit from making the petrochemical feedstock, yesterday was
the widest since September.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, LIVESTOCK  Soybeans for delivery in March advanced 0.8 percent to
$11.19 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 3:16 p.m. in
Singapore, paring this year’s decline for futures to 20 percent.
Corn for March delivery was little changed at $5.805 a bushel,
taking the loss to 7.3 percent this year. Wheat for March
delivery was little changed at $5.81 a bushel in  Chicago , after
swinging between a gain of 0.5 percent and a loss of 0.2 percent.
Futures are set for a 27 percent loss this year.  Hog futures for February settlement fell 0.1 percent to
settle at 86.325 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The price has gained 8.2 percent in 2011.  BASE METALS  Copper for three-month delivery dropped for a fourth day by
as much as 1.1 percent to $7,131 a metric ton on the London
Metal Exchange, after slumping as much as 5.6 percent yesterday.
The contract traded at $7,201.50 at 3:01 p.m. Shanghai time.
Copper for February-delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
fell as much as 5.2 percent, the biggest intraday drop since Nov.
10, before closing 4 percent lower at 53,460 yuan ($8,388) a ton.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold extended a rout into a fourth day as concern that
Europe’s debt crisis is escalating boosted the dollar, raising
the prospect that the precious metal may enter a  bear market .
Platinum dropped to a two-year low.  Spot gold dropped 0.5 percent to $1,566.55 an ounce at 1:46
p.m. in Singapore. The price lost 8 percent in the preceding

much as 1.2 percent to $1,567.60 on the Comex.  Cash platinum fell for a fourth day, losing as much 3
percent to $1,378.50 an ounce, the lowest level since Nov. 13,
2009. Palladium also dropped for a fourth day, declining 0.5
percent to $615.25 an ounce.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cocoa for March delivery retreated 2.8 percent to settle at
$2,180 a metric ton at 12:04 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . The most-active contract has dropped 28 percent this year.  Renewed speculation that output in West Africa will be
ample enough to meet demand also pressured prices. Futures
soared 8.5 percent in the previous two days after Singapore-
based trader Olam International Ltd. forecast supplies would lag
behind demand.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery dropped 2.7 percent to
22.8 cents a pound on ICE. The sweetener touched 22.68 cents,
the lowest since June 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
