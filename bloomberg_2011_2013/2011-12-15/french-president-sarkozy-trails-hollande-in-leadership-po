French socialist challenger  Francois Hollande  would defeat incumbent  Nicolas Sarkozy  by 57 to 43
percent in the deciding round of next yearâ€™s presidential
election, a poll says.  Under the French system, a run-off will be held May 6 if
no-one takes a majority in the April 22 first round. In that
initial stage of voting, Hollande would take 28 percent, Sarkozy
25 percent, anti-immigrant campaigner Marine le Pen 19 percent,
and centrist politician Francois Bayrou 11 percent, the Harris
Interactive poll said.  Former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, who announced
his candidacy last week, would get only 3 percent in the first
round, according to the poll, which was commissioned by
television station La Chaine Parlementaire.  The poll involved 1,031 people questioned Dec. 13 through
15. No margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
