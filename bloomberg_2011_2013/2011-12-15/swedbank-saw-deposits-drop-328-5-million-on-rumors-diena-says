Latvians withdrew, transferred and
paid out 176 million lati ($328.5 million) from local  Swedbank
AB (SWEDA)  following rumors about the lender’s business,  Diena  reported,
citing Janis Brazovskis, the deputy head of the bank regulator.  The drop was equal to about 10 percent of the lender’s
total deposits, said Brazovskis, according to the newspaper.
Swedbank had gained 112 million lati in deposits before the
rumors in part due to the suspension of Latvijas Krajbanka AS,
the country’s sixth-biggest deposit bank, so the change in
deposits and the size of those held made the change “not
meaningful,” Brazovskis said in the report.  Swedbank paid out about 35 million lati in deposits from
bank machines on Dec. 10 and Dec. 11, said Kristine Jakubovska,
a Swedbank spokeswoman, by telephone. The total figure included
electronic transfers and normal payments made by businesses, she
said.  -- Editor: Douglas Lytle  To contact the reporter on this story:
