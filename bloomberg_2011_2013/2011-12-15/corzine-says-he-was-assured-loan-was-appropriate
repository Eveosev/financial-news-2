Jon S, Corzine, the former chairman
and chief executive officer of MF Global Holdings Ltd., said he
was told that a $175 million loan to a European affiliate before
the firm collapsed was appropriate and legal.  “The back office in Chicago explicitly confirmed to me
that the funds were appropriately transferred,” Corzine told
lawmakers today at a House Financial Services subcommittee
hearing in Washington. Corzine made the comment in response to
statements by  CME Group Inc. (CME)  chairman Terrence Duffy that he was
aware of a loan from segregated customer accounts before MF
Global sought  bankruptcy protection  on Oct. 31.   To contact the reporter on this story:
