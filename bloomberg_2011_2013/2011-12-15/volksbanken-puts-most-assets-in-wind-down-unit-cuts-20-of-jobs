Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS) , an
Austrian bank that failed  Europe ’s bank stress tests twice this
year, is putting more than half of its assets into a unit
charged with selling them or running them off.  Volksbanken also said it will cut about 20 percent of its
staff, or 250 jobs, over the next two years. It created a “non-
core business” division to hold its Romanian lender, its
leasing unit in eastern Europe and a Malta-based business,
according to a statement that followed a supervisory board
meeting in Vienna today. The assets “will be wound down in the
medium term in order to strengthen capitalization,” it said.  The bank’s assets totaled 43.6 billion euros ($56.7
billion) at the end of September, according to its quarterly
report. The wind-down unit will contain between half and two-
thirds of that sum, Walter Groeblinger, a spokesman for the
bank, said by phone.  Volksbanken, which escaped collapse in 2008 because  Austria 
bailed out its Kommunalkredit unit, is restructuring after the
European Banking Authority said the lender is 1.05 billion euros
short of the required capital ratio of 9 percent of risk-
weighted assets.  The lender, which is controlled by 62 cooperative banks,
plans to set up a cross-guarantee accord with those banks to
boost its capital ratio. It has also agreed to sell its eastern
European business outside Romania to  Russia ’s  OAO Sberbank. (SBER)   To contact the reporters on this story:
