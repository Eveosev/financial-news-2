European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said the euro area may not be able to escape a
recession due to governments’ austerity measures.  “The unavoidable short-term contraction may be mitigated
by the return of confidence,” Draghi said during a speech in
Berlin today. “But in the medium term, sustainable growth can
be achieved only by undertaking deep structural reforms that
have been procrastinated for too long.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
