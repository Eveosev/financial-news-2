Central and eastern  Europe ’s
economic outlook worsened further in December as the euro-area
debt crisis undermined growth prospects, the  ZEW Center for
European Economic Research  and  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  said.  The economic-sentiment indicator, a measure of investor
confidence in the region, fell 4.6 points to minus 41.4 points,
ZEW and Erste Bank said today in an e-mailed statement.  The European Union is struggling to contain the debt crisis
in the euro area and the threat of a recession in the currency
bloc is worsening the outlook for central and eastern Europe
through export links. The European Commission cut the euro
area’s 2012 growth forecast by more than half to 0.5 percent on
Nov. 10, saying the debt crisis may trigger a recession.  Expectations for the euro zone have declined by 8.3 points
to a level of minus 63.6 points, today’s report said.  Economic expectations in  Turkey , the biggest economy in the
central and eastern European survey, declined 8.3 points to
minus 46.3 points. The Czech Republic’s index fell 10.3 points
to minus 54.8 points, while the Hungarian gauge declined 0.4
points to minus 57.2 points. Poland bucked the trend with its
index rising 6.8 points to minus 40.5 points.  The ZEW index reflects the difference between the
percentage of analysts who have positive outlooks and those with
negative views. Ratings range from a maximum of 100 points to a
minimum of minus 100 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
