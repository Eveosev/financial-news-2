Solon SE (SOO1) ’s insolvency, the first of
a publicly traded solar company in  Germany , won’t affect its
units in Italy, France and the U.S.  The insolvency is for now confined to the holding company
and its German units with 532 of a total 800 employees, said
 Moeller PR , which represents the administrator Ruediger Wienberg
of law firm HWW Wienberg Wilhelm. Wienberg will contact
customers and suppliers to maintain production and order
processing, it said. Wages are secured through February.  “We will use the next days to stabilize business
operations,” Wienberg said in an e-mailed statement late
yesterday. “We will then thoroughly analyze the company’s
financial situation and check all available options.”  Talks between Solon, lenders and investors on extending a
year-end deadline to repay a 275 million-euro ($358 million)
loan to Deutsche Bank AG and other German banks failed Dec. 13,
prompting the company to file for insolvency. The  shares  fell 26
percent today to 37 euro cents, giving it a market value of 6.4
million euros, after tumbling 46 percent yesterday.  The country’s solar manufacturers including Q-Cells SE and
Conergy AG are reeling from rising foreign competition just as
demand ebbs in Germany, the biggest photovoltaic market last
year. Chinese companies have increased production capacity even
after international prices slumped, tipping three U.S. solar
developers including Solyndra LLC into bankruptcy this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
