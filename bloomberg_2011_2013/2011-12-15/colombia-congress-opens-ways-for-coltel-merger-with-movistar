Colombian lawmakers approved a
proposal by Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry to open the
way for Colombia Telecomunicaciones SA to merge with Movistar, a
unit of  Telefonica SA (TEF) ,  Spain ’s largest phone company.  The merger of Telefonica’s local cellular phone unit and
Coltel, a fixed-line phone company with declining sales, would
boost competitiveness and help pay for “onerous” pension
obligations of more than 17,000 former public employees,
Echeverry said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
