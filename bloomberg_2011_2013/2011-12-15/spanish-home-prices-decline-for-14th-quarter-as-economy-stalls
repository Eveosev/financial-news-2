Spanish  home prices  fell for the
14th quarter as unemployment surged and a reduction in mortgage
lending crimped demand for property amid a slowing economy.  The average price of houses and apartments declined 7.4
percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the  National
Statistics Institute  in Madrid said today in an e-mailed
statement. Prices dropped 2.8 percent from the previous quarter.  Spain  is working through an excess of 700,000 new unsold
homes left over from a 10-year debt-fueled housing boom. The
highest  unemployment rate  in  Europe , at 23 percent, is curbing
demand, while banks are reining in lending amid a surge in bad
loans and higher borrowing costs. Spainâ€™s economy will probably
contract in the fourth quarter after stagnating in the three
months through September, Bank of Spain Chief Economist Jose
Luis Malo de Molina said on Dec. 13.  The number of mortgages for home purchases dropped for a
17th month in September, falling 42 percent, the National
Statistics Institute said on Nov. 24. Home sales in the third
quarter declined 6.3 percent from a year earlier, the Ministry
of Public Works and Housing said on Dec. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
