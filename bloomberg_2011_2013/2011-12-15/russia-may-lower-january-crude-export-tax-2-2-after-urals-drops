Russia , the world’s biggest  oil 
producer, may lower its  export duty  on most crude shipments by
2.2 percent on Jan. 1 after prices fell.  The standard duty will probably drop to $397.50 a metric
ton ($54.23 a barrel), according to Bloomberg calculations based
on Finance Ministry data. That compares with $406.60 a ton in
December.  The discounted rate on some Eastern Siberian and offshore
oil may fall to $194.10 a ton, compared with $200.90 this month.  Russia bases the export duties on the average Urals crude
price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th of the next.
 Urals , Russia’s benchmark export blend, averaged $109.09 a
barrel during the most recent monitoring period,  Alexander
Sakovich , a Finance Ministry adviser, said by phone today.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  must sign off on the taxes
for them to come into effect. Starting in October, the
government lowered the crude export duty by applying a
coefficient of 60 percent, down from 65 percent, and unified the
tax on most refined products at 66 percent of that levy.  The duty for middle distillates and heavy products will
probably be set at $262.30 a ton next month, from $268.30 in
December.  A special gasoline tax that Putin imposed from May 1 to
fight domestic shortages may fall to $357.70 a ton, from $365.90
this month. That is 90 percent of the crude duty.  The government may set the duty on liquefied petroleum
gases, such as butane and propane, at $201 a ton, down from
$221.80.  To contact the reporter on this story:
