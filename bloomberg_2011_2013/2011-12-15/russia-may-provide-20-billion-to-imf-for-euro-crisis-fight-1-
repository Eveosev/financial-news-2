Russia  may provide as much as $20
billion of assistance to the euro area through the  International
Monetary Fund , according to Arkady Dvorkovich, chief economic
aide to President  Dmitry Medvedev .  Russia has committed to $10 billion and may consider
providing another $10 billion, Dvorkovich said by telephone
today.  The possibility of Russia expanding its aid offer “isn’t
pressing yet because no one has even asked for the first ten,”
Dvorkovich said. The Russian central bank would lend the
additional money to the IMF as European central banks are doing,
he added.  Medvedev said in Brussels today that Russia is prepared to
consider aid measures for the European Union in addition to its
existing commitment to the IMF. On Oct. 31, Dvorkovich said
Russia was prepared to make as much as $10 billion available
through the IMF and hasn’t ruled out offering bilateral help to
individual EU countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
