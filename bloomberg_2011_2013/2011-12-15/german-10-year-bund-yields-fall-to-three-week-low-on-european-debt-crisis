Spanish  bonds  advanced, pushing two-
year yields to the lowest level in almost seven weeks, after the
nation sold almost double its initial maximum target of
securities at an auction.  Spain ’s notes gained for a fifth day as the government’s
cost of borrowing for five years dropped to 4.02 percent, from
5.28 percent at the previous sale of the debt on Dec. 1.
Shorter-maturity Spanish and Italian debt also rose on
speculation banks bought them to use as collateral when the
 European Central Bank  starts offering three-year loans next
week. German  bunds  fell after a report showed euro-area services
and manufacturing output shrank less than economists forecast.  “The Spanish auction went very well, they managed to sell
getting on for double what they targeted,” said Eric Wand, a
fixed-income strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in
London. “Spain is outperforming in the aftermath because people
are taking it as positive that there’s demand for these
securities.”  Spain’s two-year yields dropped 41 basis points, or 0.41
percentage point, to 3.66 percent at 4:27 p.m.  London  time, the
least since Oct. 27, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The 2.5 percent note due October 2013 rose 0.72, or 7.20 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 97.94.  Five-year yields declined 34 basis points to 4.62 percent,
and rates on the nation’s benchmark 10-year bonds due in April
2021 fell 25 basis points to 5.44 percent.  Spain Auction  Spain sold a combined 6.03 billion euros ($7.85 billion) of
debt due in January 2016, April 2020 and April 2021, compared
with an original target of 3.5 billion euros. Demand for the
2016 notes fell to 1.99 times the amount sold from 2.83 at the
previous sale on Dec. 1. Investors bid for 2.16 times the amount
of 2021 securities allotted, up from a bid-to-cover of 1.76
times at a prior auction on Oct. 20.  Italian two-year notes gained the most in a week amid
speculation investors were buying them before the ECB starts its
longer-term refinancing operation on Dec. 20.  With “all European banks able to borrow three-year money
via the LTRO at the ECB at 1 percent, the banks have massive
incentive to buy sovereign debt,”  Andrew Brenner , managing
director at Guggenheim Capital Markets LLC, a New-York based
brokerage for institutional investors, wrote in a note to
clients. “This is what the ECB wants the banks to do, so the
ECB does not have to buy them directly.”  Unlimited Funds  ECB President  Mario Draghi  announced the plan to offer
lenders unlimited funds for three years after the central bank’s
policy meeting on Dec. 8.  Italian  two-year yields  fell 52 basis points to 5.55
percent after dropping 55 basis points, the biggest decline
since Dec. 5.  The Italian government’s five-year borrowing costs climbed
to a euro-era record yesterday when the nation sold 3 billion
euros of securities due in September 2016 at an average yield of
6.47 percent, up from 6.29 percent at the Nov. 14 sale.  Euro-region governments have to repay more than 1.1
trillion euros of long- and short-term debt in 2012, according
to Bloomberg data. Italy and Spain have about 146 billion euros
of bonds and bills maturing in the first quarter of next year,
the data show.  Bunds Fall  German bunds declined, with 30-year yields climbing from a
record low, as European stocks gained and an  index (SXXP)  of services
and manufacturing was higher than forecast.  A euro-area composite  index  based on a survey of purchasing
managers in both industries rose to 47.9 from 47 in November,
London-based Markit Economics said. Economists predicted a drop
to 46.5, according to a Bloomberg News survey. A reading below
50 indicates contraction.  Thirty-year bund yields rose six basis points to 2.43
percent after dropping to a euro-era low 2.35 percent. The  10-
year  yield climbed three basis points to 1.95 percent.  The Stoxx Europe 600  Index  gained 1.1 percent, and the euro
climbed 0.3 percent to $1.3018.  Bund yields have still fallen this week as Moody’s
Investors Service said on Dec. 12 it will review the ratings of
all European Union countries after a summit on Dec. 8-9 failed
to produce “decisive policy measures” to end the debt turmoil.  Bund yields will stay low, said  Michael Leister , a fixed-
income strategist at WestLB AG in Dusseldorf,  Germany .
“Investors are happy to park their money in bunds, when there’s
really nothing concrete that came out of the EU summit.”  German  government bonds  have returned 9.2 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. Spanish debt
gained 3.2 percent and Italian bonds slid 8.1 percent, the
indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
