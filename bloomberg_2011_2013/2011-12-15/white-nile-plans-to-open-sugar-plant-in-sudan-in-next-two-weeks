White Nile Sugar Co. plans to open a
processing plant in the next two weeks, helping to meet domestic
demand for sweeteners.  White Nile will start with initial capacity of 150,000
metric tons and grow to 450,000 tons in two years, covering 40
percent of domestic demand, the company said in an e-mail.  The company is 30 percent owned by Kenana Sugar Co.,
 Sudan ’s largest producer of white, or refined, sugar, according
to its website. It was established in 2004.  Sudan is Africa’s third-biggest sugar producer after  South
Africa  and Egypt, U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
