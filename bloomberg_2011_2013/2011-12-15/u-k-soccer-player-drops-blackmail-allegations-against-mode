U.K. soccer player  Ryan Giggs 
dropped an accusation of blackmail against a former reality-TV
star with whom he is alleged to have had an extra-marital
affair.  Imogen Thomas, a glamour model and former contestant on
television show Big Brother, was “relieved that the parties and
the court accept I’m no blackmailer,” she said in a statement
today to reporters gathered at the Royal Courts of Justice in
London.  Giggs, who plays for Manchester United, was referred to as
CTB in court filings during the case after a judge banned the
press from revealing his identity earlier this year. His
identity was later revealed by a member of Parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
