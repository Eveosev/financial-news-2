U.S. stocks rose, snapping a three-
day decline in the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) , as data on
jobless claims and manufacturing signaling a strengthening
economy overshadowed concern over Europe’s debt crisis.  Utilities, health-care and consumer staples had the biggest
gains out of 10 S&P 500 groups, advancing at least 0.9 percent.
 FedEx Corp. (FDX) , the operator of the world’s biggest cargo airline,
jumped 8 percent after earnings beat analysts’ estimates on
increased holiday orders.  Novellus Systems Inc. (NVLS)  surged 16
percent as  Lam Research Corp. (LRCX)  agreed to acquire the company.  The  S&P 500  rose 0.3 percent to 1,215.75 at 4 p.m.  New York 
time, paring an earlier rally of 1.1 percent as oil declined and
financial companies erased gains. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  added 45.33 points, or 0.4 percent, to 11,868.81.  “The news on the U.S. front is surprisingly positive and
provides some counterbalance to the uncertainty in Europe,”
Eric Teal, chief investment officer at First Citizens Bancshares
Inc., which manages $4 billion in Raleigh,  North Carolina , said
in a telephone interview. “We’re focusing increasingly on the
domestic economy which looks to be on the recovery track.”  The  S&P 500  lost 3.5 percent during the first three days of
this week after posted its first back-to-back weekly gain since
October. The benchmark stock measure slumped on Dec. 13 after
the  Federal Reserve  refrained from taking new actions to bolster
growth at the world’s largest economy. The central bank said the
 U.S. economy  is maintaining its expansion even as the global
economy slows.  Jobless Claims  Global stocks extended gains this morning after Labor
Department figures showed initial jobless claims  fell by 19,000
to 366,000  last week, the fewest since May 2008. The median of
47 economists had projected 390,000, according to a Bloomberg
News survey.  Two reports showed manufacturing in the New York and
Philadelphia regions expanded more than forecast in December.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s  general economic index 
accelerated to the highest level in seven months, to 9.5 from
0.6 in November. Readings higher than zero signal expansion
among companies in the region, which covers New York, northern
 New Jersey  and southern Connecticut. The Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia’s index, covering eastern Pennsylvania, southern
New Jersey and Delaware, increased to 10.3 from 3.6.  Equities pared early gains after International Monetary
Fund Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said at an event in
 Washington  that  Europe ’s “crisis is not only unfolding, but
escalating” and cannot be resolved by one group of countries.  ‘Get a Sense’  “Investors are trying to get a sense of not only how the
economy is performing but also looking at what happens with
policy, what happens in Europe,” Kevin Caron, a market
strategist in Florham Park, New Jersey, at Stifel Nicolaus &
Co., said in a telephone interview. His firm has about $108
billion in client assets.  FedEx jumped 8 percent, the biggest rally since April 2009,
to $83.47. The company, considered an economic barometer because
it delivers goods ranging from pharmaceuticals to financial
documents, posted a quarterly profit that beat analysts’
estimates as U.S. consumers increased holiday orders from online
retailers. FedEx also ordered 27  Boeing Co. (BA)  767 jet freighters
to retire some of its older planes. Boeing increased 1 percent
to $70.61.  Novellus Surges  Novellus Systems surged 16 percent to $40.37 for the
biggest gain in the S&P 500. Lam Research agreed to buy the
maker of machinery used in semiconductor production for about
$3.3 billion in stock, valuing it at $44.42 a share. Lam
Research fell 8.4 percent to $36.17.  Financial companies were unchanged as a group after
rallying as much as 1.6 percent after  Spain  sold more debt than
it had planned. Shares in the group erased their gains as the
Securities and Exchange Commission appealed a District Court
judge’s decision to reject its proposed $285 million settlement
with  Citigroup Inc. (C)  The New York-based bank slumped 0.5 percent
to $25.92, after earlier rising as much as 3.3 percent.  Michael Kors Holdings Ltd., the clothing company founded by
the designer of that name, rose 21 percent to $24.20 in its
trading debut. The company sold 47.2 million shares yesterday
for $20 apiece to raise $944 million, 19 percent more than
planned.  Technology and energy companies in the S&P 500 posted the
only declines among 10 groups, falling at least 0.2 percent.
 First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s largest maker of thin-film solar
panels, slumped 6 percent, the biggest drop in the S&P 500, to
$31.45. The company was downgraded to “neutral” from
“outperform” by Robert W. Baird & Co.  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  slid 0.9
percent to $99.67, as the price of crude oil tumbled to its
lowest level in six weeks.  Options Expiration  Tomorrow is the expiration of futures and options contracts
on indexes and individual stocks, an event known as quadruple
witching, which occurs once every three months.  The S&P 500 has slumped 3.3 percent in 2011 and 11 percent
from its high on April 29. The index posted losses in six of the
past seven months through November. The gauge’s decline this
year may mean there are lower odds the measure will rally during
the last two weeks of 2011, if history is any guide, according
to Nautilus Capital LLC.  Since 1928, the benchmark index has rallied at year-end 60
percent of the time when it had fallen year to date, compared
with 80 percent when it was up for the year, data from Nautilus
show. The S&P 500 produced an average gain of 1.3 percent during
the last two weeks of the year.  Hedge Funds  Stocks favored by hedge funds fell more than the S&P 500
during the first three days of the week. A Goldman Sachs index
of companies that appear most often in funds’ top 10 holdings
lost 4.5 percent in the first three days of the week, a period
in which the S&P 500 fell 3.5 percent. The index rose 0.4
percent today.  Hedge funds selling assets because of client redemptions
may have exacerbated declines for equities and reinforced market
volatility, according to  Eric Green , a Philadelphia-based fund
manager at Penn Capital Management. His firm oversees about $6
billion.  “The hedge fund exposure continues to go down -- it’s year
end, they’re squaring positions off, they’re preparing for
redemptions,” Green said in a telephone interview. “The
volatility is pretty extreme, the market is getting whipped
around on nothing and most of them want to shut things down.
They probably have to sell more things than buy because they
have net redemptions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
