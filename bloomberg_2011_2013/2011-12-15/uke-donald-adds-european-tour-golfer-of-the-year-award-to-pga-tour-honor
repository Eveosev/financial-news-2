England’s  Luke Donald  was named as
the European Tour’s Golfer of the Year, a day after receiving
the U.S.  PGA Tour ’s annual award.  The 34-year-old, the  No. 1 player  in the Official World
Golf Ranking, topped the money lists on both the American and
European circuits, the only player to achieve the feat.  “It is always nice to be appreciated, especially from the
people in the sport who know the game inside out,” Donald said
in a European Tour statement. “They have recognized what I have
done this year and it is very gratifying to have that
validation.”  Donald received the award for his “historic achievement,
allied to the consistently high standard of his golf throughout
2011,” the European Tour said. The judging panel featured print
journalists and commentators from radio and television.  He won three times on the European Tour: at the World Golf
Championships match-play event in February, the Scottish Open,
and the BMW PGA Championship. He became world No. 1 for a first
time in May after beating countryman  Lee Westwood  in a playoff
at the BMW PGA Championship.  A third-place finish at the Dubai World Championship on
Dec. 11 ensured that he finished atop the European Tour’s Order
of Merit with  5.3 million euros  ($6.9 million) in prize money.
His on-course winnings on the PGA Tour were $6.7 million.  Donald led the European money list after playing six fewer
events than second-place Rory McIlroy and topped the U.S. money
list having played seven fewer events than runner-up Webb
Simpson.  To contact the reporter on this story:
