HNA Group, a Chinese investor in
aviation and shipping, and Bravia Capital completed the $1.05
billion acquisition of  General Electric Co. (GE) ’s GE SeaCo venture,
the world’s fifth largest container-leasing enterprise.  All “key” SeaCo managers, including Chief Executive
Officer David G. Amble, will remain with the company, according
to a statement. The purchase includes container fleets owned
separately by GE and partner  SeaCo Ltd. (SEAOF) , for a total of about
870,000 20-foot equivalancy units, the standard industry
measure.  The Chinese company is pressing ahead with the purchase of
lessor GE SeaCo after walking away from a 330 million euro ($429
million) investment in Spanish hotel chain  NH Hoteles SA . HNA
cited market conditions for its decision this week to abandon
the hotel deal at a cost of $15 million in compensation.  HNA and Bravia plan to expand GE SeaCo’s container fleet
“significantly” during the next two years, they said in
August, as rising shipments of Asian-made goods to  Europe  and
the U.S. boosts demand for cargo boxes. Fairfield, Connecticut-
based GE is selling the unit as it sheds finance assets to focus
on industrial operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
