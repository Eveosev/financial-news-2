The U.S. is the biggest foreign
investor in  Brazil , with assets exceeding  China ’s by more than
13 to 1, even after  Asia ’s biggest economy supplanted the U.S.
as the country’s biggest trading partner.  The stock of U.S. investments in Brazil, excluding inter-
company loans, totaled $105 billion at the end of 2010,
according to a report published today by the central bank.
Chinese investments totaled $8 billion, putting it in 16th place
behind countries including Canada and Mexico.  Investments in financial services account for 17 percent of
the stock of foreign investments, followed by the drinks
industry, with 9 percent, the central bank said. Foreign
investment has increased to $580 billion in 2010, from $163
billion in 2005, the central bank said. Including inter-company
loans, the total figure was $661 billion, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
