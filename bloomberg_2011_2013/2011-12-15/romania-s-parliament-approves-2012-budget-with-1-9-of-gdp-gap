The Romanian Parliament approved the
government’s 2012 budget, which narrows the deficit by more than
half to meet pledges to the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund .  Lawmakers voted 239-168 today in Bucharest in favor of the
plan to narrow the fiscal gap to 1.9 percent of  gross domestic
product  in 2012 from a target of 4.4 percent in 2011, said
Senator Vasile Blaga, who also leads the upper house.  “Today’s vote pushes through Parliament a budget that
consolidates  Romania ’s financial position and that doesn’t have
any electoral hints ahead of the general election next year,”
Prime Minister Emil Boc said after approval.  The budget outlines public-spending cuts through wage and
pension freezes, trimming state jobs and revamping money-losing
state companies before a general election late next year. The
country is under pressure to keep to its 5 billion-euro ($6.5
billion) precautionary loan agreement with the IMF and EU.  The budget is based on economic growth of 2.1 percent, less
than the previous forecast of 3.5 percent, and inflation at 3.5
percent at the end of next year. The government expects the
economy to grow 1.5 percent to 2 percent this year.  The leu gained 0.2 percent to 4.3415 per euro in Bucharest
trading as of 12:57 p.m. today, while the Bucharest Stock
Exchange’s benchmark BET Index rose 0.9 percent to 4,315.8
points.  Widening Deficit  The government may let the  budget deficit  widen next year
to as much as 2.5 percent of GDP under Romanian accounting
standards, as agreed with the IMF and the EU, as long as it
keeps the gap within 3 percent under European standards. This
would enable the EU to end excessive-deficit procedures against
Romania.  The eastern European country is cutting the number of its
public jobs to 1.1 million by the end of next year from 1.4
million in 2010, President Traian Basescu said on Nov. 24. The
government has already eliminated 180,000 jobs, he said.  The country will try to push ahead with plans to sell
minority stakes in state-owned companies, such as  Transgaz SA (TGN) ,
 Transelectrica (TEL)  SA and Romgaz SA, and majority stakes in  Oltchim (OLT) 
SA and newly formed power companies Oltenia SA and Hunedoara SA,
even during a time of market turmoil that led to the failed sale
of a 9.8 percent stake in  OMV Petrom SA (SNP)  in July.  Borrowing Plans  Romania plans to borrow about 57 billion lei ($17 billion)
next year and 2.4 billion euros to finance its budget deficit
and pay for maturing debt, Deputy Finance Minister Gheorghe
Gherghina said on Nov. 25.  Boc’s coalition government will also face a no-confidence
vote filed by the opposition  Social Democrats  and Liberals today
over a plan to merge parliamentary and local elections next
year. The vote may take place on Dec. 22, Roberta Anastase, the
head of the Parliament’s lower house, said on Dec. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
