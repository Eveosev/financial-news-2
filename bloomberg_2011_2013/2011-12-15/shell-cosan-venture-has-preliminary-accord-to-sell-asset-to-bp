Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and Cosan
Industria & Comercio SA’s joint venture in  Brazil  has reached a
preliminary accord to sell its jet-fuel unit to  BP Plc , the
nation’s antitrust regulator said today.  The venture, called Raizen, was granted an additional five
days to present the agreement to the regulator before being
fined, Olavo Chinaglia, interim president of the agency, said at
a meeting in Brasilia today. Cade, as the regulator is known,
ordered the sale after Shell and Cosan combined some assets in
Brazil, including service stations and the jet-fuel unit that
Cosan had bought from  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)   “Failure to carry out Cade’s decision means the operation
will have to be reverted with a return of assets to Cosan,”
said Chinaglia. “This would affects the assessment of the joint
venture formed between Shell and Cosan.”  A final ruling on the entire joint venture hasn’t been
scheduled yet, Cade’s attorney Gilvandro Araujo said. Raizen is
the world’s biggest processor of sugar-cane into sweetener and
ethanol.  To contact the reporters on this story:
