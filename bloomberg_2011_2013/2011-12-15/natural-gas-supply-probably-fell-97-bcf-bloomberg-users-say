The U.S. Energy Department’s
natural-gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30
a.m. in  Washington , will show that supplies fell 2.5 percent
last week, according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The government’s Natural Gas Storage Report will show that
inventories declined 97 billion cubic feet in the week ended
Dec. 9 to 3.734 trillion cubic feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for January delivery rose 3.4 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $3.17 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 10:23.  Bloomberg compiles the anonymous survey based on estimates
by at least 100 users each week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
