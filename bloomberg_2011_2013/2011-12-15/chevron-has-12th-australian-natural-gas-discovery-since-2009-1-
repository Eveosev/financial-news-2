Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-largest
U.S. oil producer, reported its 12th natural-gas discovery off
Australia since mid-2009 as the company advances with the A$29
billion ($29 billion) Wheatstone project.  Chevron’s Vos-1 well found 453 feet (138 meters) of gas in
the Carnarvon Basin off Western Australia, the San Ramon,
California-based company said today in a statement.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Europe’s largest oil company, holds
50 percent of the permit.  Chevron’s A$43 billion Gorgon LNG development and
Wheatstone venture are among Australian projects aiming to tap
increasing Asian demand for the fuel as countries reduce their
reliance on coal to curb carbon emissions. Shell, Santos Ltd.,
ConocoPhillips and Inpex Corp. are among energy companies
planning about A$200 billion of LNG projects in  Australia .  Chevron decided earlier this year to go forward with
Wheatstone, targeting first LNG shipments to Asia in 2016. The
U.S. energy producer has called Gorgon and Wheatstone the
“centerpieces” of its global expansion plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
