Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
Ltd. (TEVA) ’s Cephalon unit and  Acusphere Inc. (ACUS)  sued Celgene Corp. for
patent infringement related to the breast cancer drug Abraxane.  The lawsuit claims Celgene’s Abraxane violates an Acusphere
patent for a drug formulation of paclitaxel particles, according
to the complaint filed yesterday in federal court in Boston.
Abraxane’s active ingredient is the compound paclitaxel.  The injected drug, used to treat metastatic breast cancer,
was obtained by Summit, New Jersey-based Celgene as part of its
purchase of Abraxis BioScience Inc. in 2010. The drug generated
$282 million in sales in the first nine months of this year,
according to the company’s quarterly reports.  Cephalon, acquired in October by Petah Tikva, Israel-based
Teva, is the exclusive licensee of Watertown, Massachusetts-
based Acusphere’s patent. The companies are seeking cash
compensation and an order to block further use of the invention.  The case is Cephalon Inc. v.  Celgene Corp. (CELG) , 11cv12226, U.S.
District Court for the District of Massachusetts (Boston).  To contact the reporter on this story:
