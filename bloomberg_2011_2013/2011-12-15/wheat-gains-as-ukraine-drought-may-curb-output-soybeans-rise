Wheat rose on speculation that
drought in Ukraine will curb production and soybeans and corn
gained as dry weather may hurt output in  South America .  Winter wheat emerged on 5.14 million hectares (12.7 million
acres) in Ukraine as of Dec. 8, down 22 percent from a year
earlier after the driest autumn in at least 50 years,
UkrAgroConsult said Dec. 12. Parts of Argentina and  Brazil  will
have hot weather this weekend, increasing stress to corn and
soybeans, Telvent DTN Inc. said yesterday.  “The effects of the dryness on winter wheat emergence have
been large with crop prospects materially diminished in the
Ukraine,” said Nick Higgins, an analyst at Rabobank
International in London. “It’s too early to be calling a
drought in South America. It has been dry and the near-term
forecasts do not look promising.”  Wheat for March delivery gained 0.8 percent to $5.8525 a
bushel by 2 p.m.  London  time on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Futures are set for a 26 percent loss this year. Milling wheat
for March delivery on NYSE Liffe in Paris gained 0.8 percent to
178 euros ($232) a metric ton. The price is down 30 percent this
year.  Soybeans for delivery in March gained 0.8 percent to
$11.185 a bushel in Chicago. Futures are headed for a 20 percent
decline in 2011, the first annual loss in three years. Corn for
March delivery was unchanged at $5.8075 a bushel. The price has
dropped 7.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
