U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  and Foreign Secretary  William Hague  will be
questioned on the resolution to the euro-region crisis by
lawmakers in the House of Commons.  They have been invited to appear before the House of
Commons’  European Scrutiny Committee , which is hearing testimony
on developments in  Europe  and the possible consequences for
Britain, the committee said in an e-mailed statement.  “We will examine what we see as the crux of the problem,
that is, how to reconcile the necessary monetary and fiscal
policies, based initially on the statement of Dec. 9 by the euro
heads of state or government, with the legal and institutional
constraints,” the committee said. “The government’s position
on the monetary and fiscal possibilities within the potential
confines of an intergovernmental agreement will be central to
our inquiry.”  The committee, which is chaired by Bill Cash, a prominent
euro-skeptic, has also called for written submissions by Jan.
13. No date for the meetings with Osborne and Hague has yet been
published.  To contact the reporter on this story:
