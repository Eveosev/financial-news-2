Deezer , a French online music-
streaming service  will begin operations in  Germany  Dec. 19 and
aims to be available in 200 countries by June, Handelsblatt
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Axel Dauchez.  Deezer is debuting in Germany before the arrival of Spotify
Ltd., the London-based service that was made available in the
U.S. in July, the newspaper said, adding that Deezer will
cooperate with Facebook Inc. in Germany.  Bitkom, the technology and telecommunications association,
reached an agreement within the past few days under which online
music services will transfer 6 euro cents ($0.08) to 9 cents per
song to German music-rights collection agency Gema, Handelsblatt
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
