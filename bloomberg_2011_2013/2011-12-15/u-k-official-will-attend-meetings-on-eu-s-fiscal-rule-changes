An official from Britain’s Treasury
will sit in on European Union meetings that will decide on
tighter rules for euro-area national budgets, a U.K. government
official said.  The official will be part of a group reporting to EU
finance ministers that will work toward agreement on detailed
proposals, spell out plans for implementation and decide on
which institutions of the 27-nation bloc can be used to apply
the accord.  The U.K. official was asked to join the group in Brussels
today, less than a week after Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s
demands to protect  London ’s financial industry almost wrecked an
EU summit that was discussing how to rescue the euro.  The U.K. leader refused to join the 26 other EU nations in
backing a new treaty for the bloc after he failed to secure
safeguards that would have stopped EU plans to police financial
services in London,  Europe ’s trading hub.  To contact the reporter on this story:
