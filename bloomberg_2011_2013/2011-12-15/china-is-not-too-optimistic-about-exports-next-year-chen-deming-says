Chinese Commerce Minister  Chen
Deming  said he is “not too optimistic” about exports next year
after a decline in the growth margin for trade in December.  “The growth rate for exports in December is going to slow
down,” Chen told journalists in Geneva today. In every month of
the fourth quarter, “exports were 2 percentage points down
compared with same period last year.”  Exports in the first part of 2011 were better than those in
the second half “so the growth rate will still look pretty good
this year,” he said. The growth rate for imports this year will
be about 5 percentage points higher than that for exports, he
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
