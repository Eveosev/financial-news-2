Romania ’s  Supreme Court  found former
Prime Minister Adrian Nastase innocent of giving a bribe to
another government official while in office seven years ago.  Nastase, 61, a member of the  Social Democratic Party , was
charged with offering money to Ioan Melinescu, the former head
of Romania’s anti-money laundering agency, to stop a probe into
his wife’s bank account, where he allegedly hide a bribe of
about $400,000. Nastase, who has denied all wrongdoing, still
faces other corruption charges.  “I was expecting Mr. Nastase to be acquitted,” said
Social Democratic chief Victor Ponta after the ruling. “For
seven years he has been harassed by President Traian Basescu and
the state’s institutions. I regret that nobody can give Mr.
Nastase these years back.”  Prosecutors said they will file an appeal to the same
court, which is the only court that handles cases involving
high-ranking individuals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
