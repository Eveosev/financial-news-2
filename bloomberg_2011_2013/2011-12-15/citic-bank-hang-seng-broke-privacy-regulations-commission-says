Hong Kong ’s privacy watchdog said
today that two Hong Kong-based banks, CITIC Bank International
Ltd. and  Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (11) , violated privacy rules.  CITIC Bank transferred the data of 150,000 customers to
three insurance companies for direct marketing between 2006 and
2010, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data
said in a statement on its website. CITIC Bank has since stopped
the practice, the commission said.  Hang Seng Bank kept its clients bankruptcy data for 99
years instead of eight years, the statement said. Hang Seng has
since amended its policy, the statement said.  The commission said Hong Kong’s legislature is considering
tougher privacy laws.  To contact the reporter on this story:
