Europe ’s sugar refiners paid an
additional 35 million euros ($45 million) in the marketing
season that started Oct. 1 to import raw sugar because duty-free
shipments have fallen short, an industry group said.  “Our industry has been forced to pay nearly 35 million
euros in the last seven days alone to get its hands on raw
material supply that its refineries and the market desperately
need,” Joao Pereira, president of the Brussels-based European
Sugar Refiners’ Association, said in a statement e-mailed today.  The European Union today granted licenses to import 36,000
metric tons of raw sugar at a duty of 263.50 euros a ton, the
European Commission, the EU’s regulatory arm, said. Last week,
licenses were awarded to import 100,000 tons of the sweetener at
a duty of 252.50 euros to 255 euros a ton. The tariff to import
from countries that have no preferential agreement with the EU
is usually 339 euros a ton. Import tenders at reduced duty were
approved Nov. 24 to try to ease shortages.  Refiners have to use the tender system because duty-free
supplies that usually come to the EU from the Africa, Caribbean
and Pacific group of countries and some least developed nations
have fallen short of initial estimates, the refiners’ group
said.  “Our industry is running at 60 percent capacity and this
is just not sustainable,” Pereira said. “Thousands of high-
quality European manufacturing jobs in our industry are at
stake.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
