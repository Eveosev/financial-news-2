The Serbian  budget deficit  narrowed
in November after state-owned companies paid profits to the
budget and citizens paid tax on interest they received on their
savings deposits, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The 11-month report was published before the government is
due to unveil the draft 2012 budget, which parliament needs to
adopt by the end of December.  The monthly shortfall in November of 11.3 billion dinars
($145.09 million), calculated under International Monetary Fund
methodology, brought the total January-November gap to 119.97
billion dinars, compared with a 142.7 billion-dinar cap set in a
revised 2011 budget.  If the government was to meet its full-year target for the
fiscal gap, the remaining 22.7 billion dinars would be the
highest monthly shortfall this year.  The fiscal deficit of 142.7 billion dinars will represent
4.5 percent of  Serbia ’s gross domestic product, as agreed with
the IMF under its $1.3 billion precautionary loan deal, under
which Serbia has committed to cut the 2012 budget gap to 4.25
percent of GDP in order to keep its public debt under control.  The Balkan nation’s total public debt, comprising the
government’s liabilities to creditors at home and abroad, moved
up to 44.8 percent of GDP from 44.3 percent of GDP in the
previous month, calculated by local methodology, the ministry
said on its website.  Serbia needs to observe its self-imposed fiscal rule that
limits public debt at 45 percent of GDP to ensure macroeconomic
stability. The  Finance Ministry ’s report today showed the public
debt-to-GDP ratio at 42.2 percent of GDP if the European Union’s
Maastricht criteria were used for calculations, up from 41.6
percent in October.  Earlier this month, the government decided to halt further
market borrowing through the end of 2011 to make sure the 45
percent rule is not breached.  To contact the reporter on this story:
