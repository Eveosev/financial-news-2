Selex Sistemi Integrati SpA Chairman
Giuseppe Veredice will also take on the role of chief executive
officer of the  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC)  subsidiary after the resignation
of Marina Grossi,  Il Messaggero   reported , without saying where
it got the information.  Grossi resigned yesterday following allegations that she
set up a slush fund to pay off politicians. Finmeccanica, based
in Rome, said yesterday that the defense company’s board would
make decisions on management after a shareholders’ meeting
today. Grossi’s husband, Pier Francesco Guarguaglini, resigned
as Finmeccanica chairman on Dec. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
