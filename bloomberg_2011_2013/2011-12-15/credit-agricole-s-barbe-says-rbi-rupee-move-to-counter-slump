Sebastien Barbe, chief emerging
market strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in Paris, comments on
the outlook for  India ’s currency after the  Reserve Bank of India 
tightened rules for rupee forward trading, saying canceled
contracts can’t be bought again.  The new rules will take immediate effect, it said in a
statement on its website today.  “This is showing the commitment of the RBI to fight
further rupee depreciation. Of course you could argue that India
also needs to reduce the current account deficit. However, the
current account issue can only be fixed in the medium term and
the RBI could not wait and had to act in the short term. I think
this draws a line in the sand at close to 54 per dollar.  ‘‘Our view is that the slowdown in exports will be followed
by a decrease in imports and this should allow reduction in the
current account deficit, and provide some more support to the
rupee in 2012, particularly if risk appetite comes back.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
