France  is “long overdue” in the
eyes of investors to lose its top credit ratings as Europe’s
sovereign debt crisis persists, according to  Peter Boockvar , a
Miller Tabak & Co. strategist.  Boockvar drew his conclusion from the rates on swap
contracts that protect against defaults. French bonds are more
expensive to insure than government debt from Indonesia and the
Philippines, which both have non-investment-grade ratings, as he
wrote yesterday in an e-mail.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the rate on five-year
contracts for French government bonds with those for the two
emerging markets, according to data compiled by CMA Datavision.  France’s credit-default swap rate was 10 basis points
higher than  Indonesia ’s and 37 basis points higher than the
Philippines’ two days ago, based on CMA’s figures. Each basis
point amounts to 0.01 percentage point.  The Asian countries were among 14 emerging markets with
lower CDS rates than France, as Boockvar noted in the e-mail.
Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Thailand were among the
others. All five have BBB-level ratings, putting them at the
lowest end of the investment-grade scale.  France is likely to lose its AAA rating from  Standard &
Poor’s  before its Aaa rating from Moody’s Investors Service is
cut, according to Boockvar, who is based in New York. S&P said
on Dec. 5 that it was looking at ratings on France and 14 more
countries in the euro region for possible reductions. Moody’s
took similar action a week later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
