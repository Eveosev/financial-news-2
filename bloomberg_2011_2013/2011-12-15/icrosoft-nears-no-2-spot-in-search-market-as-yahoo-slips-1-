Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  came close to
beating out  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  for second place in the U.S. Internet
search market last month after the company’s Bing service made
gains on other sites, according to  ComScore Inc. (SCOR)   Microsoft, the world’s largest software company, accounted
for 15 percent of U.S. Internet queries in November, up from
14.8 percent the previous month, ComScore said. Yahoo had 15.1
percent, down from 15.2 percent. Google’s share fell to 65.4
percent from 65.6 percent.  Seeking to compete better with Google, Microsoft has been
adding features to its search engine, including integration with
social-networking service Facebook Inc. to offer friends’ input
on the best query results. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
also provides technology to power Yahoo’s search service under a
10-year agreement between the companies, which are trying to
attract more marketers to buy advertising on query-results
pages.  Google (GOOG) , based in Mountain View, California, may control 76
percent of the U.S. market for search-based ads this year,
according to  EMarketer Inc.  in New York. Sunnyvale, California-
based Yahoo may get 7.9 percent, and Microsoft may have 8
percent.  Google rose 0.2 percent to $619.54 at 4 p.m. New York time.
Microsoft fell 0.1 percent to $25.56 while Yahoo rose 0.9
percent to $15.16.  To contact the reporters on this story:
