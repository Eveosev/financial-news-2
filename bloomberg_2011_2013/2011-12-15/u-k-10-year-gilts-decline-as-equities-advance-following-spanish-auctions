U.K. 10-year gilts fell, pushing
yields up from a record low, as stocks advanced and  Spain  sold
almost double its  maximum target  at bond auctions today, easing
demand for the British securities as a haven.  The pound erased its gain versus the euro as U.K. retail
sales dropped more than economists predicted in November and an
index of  factory orders  fell to the lowest in more than a year
this month. Spain sold 6.03 billion euros ($7.8 billion) of
bonds compared with a maximum target of 3.5 billion euros set by
the Treasury. The FTSE 100 Index of shares climbed 0.6 percent,
after slipping 2.3 percent yesterday.  “It’s a classic case of the market looking outward rather
than internally, and the bigger picture is dominating the theme
in gilt markets right now,” said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income
strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in
 London . “The Spanish auction was helpful, and there has been a
bit of a relief rally” in higher-yielding assets.  Ten-year gilt yields increased three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.12 percent at 4:33 p.m. London time after
falling to 2.06 percent, the least since Bloomberg began
compiling the data in 1992. The 3.75 percent bond due September
2021 dropped 0.240, or 2.40 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,552) face
amount, to 114.270. Two-year yields rose four basis points to
0.38 percent, after slipping to 0.309 percent.  The pound gained 0.2 percent to $1.5500 and was little
changed at 84 pence per euro, after being as strong as 83.76
pence. It climbed yesterday to the most since Feb. 18.  Gilt Returns  Sterling has gained 3 percent in the past three months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. The dollar rose 5.8 percent and
the yen climbed 2.3 percent.  Gilts have returned 16 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Investors bought the securities as
an alternative to assets denominated in the euro as European
Union leaders struggled to solve a debt crisis that has forced
 Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  to seek bailouts. German bunds
gained 9.2 percent and Italian bonds lost 8.1 percent.  U.K. government bonds climbed this year, pushing 10- and
two-year yields to record lows, as the economy slowed, and the
 Bank of England  increased its bond-purchase target by 75 billion
pounds to 275 billion pounds.  Outlook Dims  Bank of England Chief Economist  Spencer Dale  said this week
the economy may shrink for at least one quarter as the outlook
dims in  Europe , Britain’s biggest export market.  “To the extent that prospects for the economy continue to
look poor in the euro area, that will limit prospects for the
U.K. and will also reinforce the safe-haven status of gilts on a
relative basis,” said  Sam Hill , a fixed-income strategist at
 RBC Capital Markets  in London. “Low yields are justified both
on the grounds of pessimistic outlook for output growth, and the
prospect of more asset purchases from the Bank of England.”  The  factory gauge  declined to minus 23 from minus 19 the
previous month, the  Confederation of British Industry  said in a
report in London today. That’s the lowest since October 2010. A
measure of export orders fell to minus 32, the lowest since
January 2010, from minus 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
