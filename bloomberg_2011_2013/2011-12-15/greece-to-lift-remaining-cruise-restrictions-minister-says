Greece  will abolish remaining
restrictions on non-European Union cruise ships based at Greek
ports which offer round trips, Development, Competitiveness and
Shipping Minister Michalis Chrisochoides said.  “We want large cruise ship companies to come to Greece and
to use our ports,” Chrisochoides said at a conference in Athens
today. “The draft law for the full lifting of cabotage
restrictions will be submitted to  parliament  tomorrow.”  While Greece partly lifted cabotage restrictions last year,
which required ships operating in Greek waters and flying third-
country flags to employ Greek sailors, cruise-ship companies
still had to sign agreements with Greece lasting for as long as
three years and to meet certain conditions.  These included payment of a special tax to support the
welfare of Greek sailors and offering cruises that last a
minimum of 48 hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
