European Union carbon permits
rebounded from a record low as traders bought  call options 
totaling at least 4.7 million metric tons in the December 2012
futures contract.  Call options give the buyer the right to purchase at a set
level. Put options give the buyer the right to sell at a certain
price. December 2011 options expired yesterday.  December carbon futures rose 5 percent to close at 6.77
euros ($8.80) a metric ton after finishing yesterday at a record
6.45 euros, according to data from the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London. December 2012 gained 4.8 percent to 7.19
euros a ton.  The call option strike prices ranged from 8 euros to 50
euros, ICE data show. The most popular strike price was 20
euros, where 2 million tons changed hands at about 9 euro cents
a ton, the data show. There were 100,000 tons of the most
expensive strike traded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
