Sugar, cocoa and coffee may extend
declines as farmers increased production to take advantage of
higher prices, according to  Barclays Capital .  Sugar climbed to a 30-year high of 36.08 cents a pound on
Feb. 2, while coffee reached a 14-year high of $3.089 a pound on
May 3 as demand outstripped supplies. Cocoa rose to the $3,775
on March 4 after a civil war in top global producer Ivory Coast
following a disputed presidential election.  “The outlook for agriculture is a lot weaker than for
other commodities,”  Sudakshina Unnikrishnan , an analyst at the
bank in  London , said at a press briefing today. “The supply
side adjusted very quickly.”  Sugar prices may slide on good crops from  India , the
European Union,  Russia  and Thailand, while “very good crops”
in West Africa may weigh on cocoa prices, Unnikrishnan said.  “West African crops are looking very good and it’s
unlikely that we will see supply-side disruptions,” she said.
“The political risk factor in  Ivory Coast  has also
dissipated.”  Sugar may be supported at 20 cents a pound as millers in
Brazil, the world’s largest producer, could switch to ethanol if
prices fall too much, according to Barclays.  “Prices could go below 20 cents, but we don’t expect to
see it trading at such levels on a sustained basis,” she said.
“The cost of sugar production for older mills is around 16
cents to 17 cents a pound and for new units it is at 20 cents to
21 cents a pound, and this could support prices.”  Coffee supplies improved with a record off-year crop in
Brazil, the world’s largest producer, she added.  Coffee on ICE  “There may be tightness in the higher quality mild coffees
because of the drop in Colombian production, but this is likely
to be reflected in the price difference between the various
grades of coffee instead of on the ICE market,” she said.  Prices of all agricultural commodities including cotton and
corn are expected to be lower next year, the bank said. Soybeans
may have “upside potential,” as La Nina weather conditions may
result in dry weather in Argentina and  Brazil , Barclays said. La
Nina is a weather pattern characterized by cool temperatures in
the equatorial  Pacific Ocean .  “Grain prices will ease but some support may be seen in
the first quarter ahead of the battle for acreage in the U.S,”
she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
