Deutsche Bahn AG ’s Schenker Rail
Deutschland cargo unit won’t match 2008 operating profit levels
until 2015 as  Germany ’s rail freight grows more slowly than
expected, Financial Times Deutschland  said , citing unidentified
people close to the supervisory board.  Mothballing of freight cars following the recession and
their reintroduction into  service  has been expensive, at a cost
exceeding 100 million euros ($130 million), FTD said.  The unit will post a profit of a little less than 100
million euros next year following the sale of property in the
U.K., the German newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
