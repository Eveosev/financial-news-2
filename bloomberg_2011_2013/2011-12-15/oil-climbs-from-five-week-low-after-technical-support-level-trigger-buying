Oil rebounded from a five-week low
in  New York  on speculation that yesterday’s drop, the biggest
since September, was exaggerated.  West Texas Intermediate futures gained as much as 1.1
percent after nearing the 50-day moving average, signaling
yesterday’s sell-off was overdone, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The euro stabilized after dropping yesterday to the
lowest level against the dollar since January.  China ’s
purchasing managers’ index data showed manufacturing recovered
from its biggest contraction since March 2009.  “We had a huge sell-off yesterday, but today the euro is
steady, and China’s PMI data improved from the previous month,
helping the markets,” saidRobert Montefusco, senior broker at
Sucden Financial in London.  Crude for January delivery rose as much as $1.04 to $95.99
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , compared with the 50-day moving average of about
$94.25 a barrel. It was at $95.70 at 1:45 p.m. London time.
Yesterday, the contract fell $5.19 to $94.95, the lowest
settlement since Nov. 4. Prices have risen 4.7 percent this year
after climbing 15 percent in 2010.  Brent oil for January settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures  Europe  exchange increased 1.11, or 1.1 percent, to
$106.13 a barrel. The contract expires today. The more-actively
traded February future was up $1.21 at $105.46. The European
benchmark crude was at a premium of $10.43 to WTI, compared with
a record $27.88 on Oct. 14.  U.S. Jobless Claims  Crude extended gains after a report showed initial jobless
claims in the U.S. unexpectedly declined to a three-year low
last week. New applications for  unemployment benefits  dropped by
19,000 to 366,000 in the week ended Dec. 10, the fewest since
May 2008, the Labor Department said. The median forecast of 47
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected 390,000.  Crude fell 5.2 percent in New York yesterday after the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided in Vienna
to increase its production ceiling to 30 million barrels a day,
the first change in three years. The drop in equities and the
euro because of concerns over Europe’s debt crisis also pushed
oil lower. The euro strengthened to $1.3038 today after
weakening by 0.4 percent to $1.2983 yesterday.  “Not much was expected out of the OPEC meeting,”  Olivier
Jakob , managing director of research group Petromatrix GmbH in
Zug,  Switzerland , said in a note today. “‘The flat price drop
can be seen as exaggerated given that the OPEC decision was very
much expected.’’  ‘Spike Toward $200’  Brent crude  will trade from $100 to $130 a barrel for most
of 2012 and average $115, according to  Gordon Kwan , head of
energy research at Mirae Asset Securities Co. in  Hong Kong . A
‘‘short-term spike toward $200’’ can’t be ruled out if economic
sanctions against  Iran  lead to military actions around the
 Persian Gulf , he said today in an e-mailed report. Kwan was the
most accurate forecaster of New York oil prices of 26 analysts
ranked by Bloomberg in the eight quarters ended June 30.  Saudi Arabia  won’t compensate for any potential decline in
Iranian oil supply if the Persian country comes under sanctions
affecting its exports of crude, Iranian Oil Minister Rostam
Qasemi said.  Iran, the second-largest producer in OPEC after Saudi
Arabia, may come under additional sanctions that target its
crude trade as the European Union and other importers seek to
intensify pressure on the country over its nuclear program.
Qasemi met with his Saudi counterpart Ali al-Naimi in Vienna
yesterday before the OPEC meeting.  ‘‘Minister Naimi rejected that he wants to replace any
crude if Iran faces any sanctions,” Qasemi told reporters
yesterday. Al-Naimi declined to comment.  The euro-area economy is likely to slip back into a
recession, according to Ernst & Young LLP. A new plan by
political leaders to end the debt crisis hasn’t completely
eliminated the risk of a breakup of the currency region, it said
in report published in  London  today.  The 27 member states of the European Union accounted for 16
percent of global oil consumption last year, based on BP Plc’s
annual Statistical Review of World Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
