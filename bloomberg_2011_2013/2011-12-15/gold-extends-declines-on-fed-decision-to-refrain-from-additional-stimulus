Gold fell for a fourth day, heading
for the first quarterly loss in more than three years, after the
 Federal Reserve  failed to announce more stimulus measures.  The Fed said Dec. 13 that the U.S. is maintaining its
expansion and refrained from taking new actions to bolster the
economy. Gold has dropped 2.8 percent this quarter as the dollar
rallied 2.2 percent against a six-currency basket.  “Quantitative easing isn’t in the cards any time soon,”
 Scott Gardner , the chief investment officer at Verdmont Capital
SA in  Panama , said in an e-mail. A stronger dollar has also been
“negative news” for gold, he said.  Gold futures for February delivery fell 0.6 percent to
settle at $1,577.20 an ounce at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices dropped 7.6 percent in the previous three days. A
loss this quarter would be first since the period ended Sept.
30, 2008.  Yesterday, gold closed below its 200-day moving average for
the first time in almost three years. The drop means prices may
tumble to $1,400 “in a hurry,” according to  Dave Lutz , the
head of exchange-traded fund trading and strategy at Stifel
Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore.  The metal is still up 78 percent since the end of 2008 as
the Fed kept U.S. borrowing costs at a record low and made debt
purchases to spur growth. Prices have climbed 11 percent in
2011, heading for an 11th straight annual gain, as investors
sought a haven amid prospects of stagnating global growth.  Record ETP Holdings  Holdings  in bullion-backed exchange-traded products rose to
an all-time high of 2,360.81 metric tons yesterday, according to
data tracked by Bloomberg News.  “Over the course of the last three days, there’s been a
shift to people raising cash and selling gold,” Fred Schoenstein, a trader at Heraeus Precious Metals Management in
 New York , said in a telephone interview. “The economic outlook
hasn’t changed, and the euro situation has only gotten worse.
The outlook remains relatively bullish for gold.”  Silver futures for March delivery rose 1.2 percent to
$29.274 an ounce on the Comex.  Platinum futures for January delivery dropped 1.4 percent
to $1,407 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Also on
the Nymex, palladium futures for March delivery gained 0.2
percent to $620.65 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
