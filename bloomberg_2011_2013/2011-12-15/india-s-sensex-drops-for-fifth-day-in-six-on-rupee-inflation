India ’s benchmark stock index fell
for the fifth time in six days on concern a slumping currency
and faster-than-estimated inflation may restrict efforts to
stimulate slowing growth in the South Asian nation.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , India’s largest mobile-phone operator,
tumbled 2.9 percent after a report said the nation’s telecom
regulator may take legal action against the company. The rupee
weakened to a record low today, hurt by parliamentary gridlock,
elevated  inflation , a widening budget gap and the weakest
quarterly economic growth in two years. Inflation remained at
more than 9 percent for a 12th straight month, data showed
yesterday.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the biggest engineering
company, declined 2.4 percent, a sixth day of losses.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, slid 0.2 percent
to 15,851.30, according to preliminary closing prices at 3:30
p.m. in Mumbai, its lowest close since Nov. 25. The S&P CNX
 Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. lost
0.4 percent to 4,746.35. The  BSE 200 (BSE200)  Index fell 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
