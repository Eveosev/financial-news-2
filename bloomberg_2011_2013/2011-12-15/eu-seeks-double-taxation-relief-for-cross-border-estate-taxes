The European Union urged its members
to provide more relief from double taxation in estate-tax cases
that stretch across national borders.  The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, also
called on governments to review their inheritance-tax procedures
so they do not discriminate against residents who live elsewhere
in the region. Today’s proposals do not include new legislation
or a call for countries to harmonize those procedures, the
commission said.  Cross-border estate-tax issues affect individual finances
much more than national budgets, the EU said. It estimated that
proceeds from cross-border inheritance taxes make up less than
0.5 percent of tax revenues in member nations.  “The burden of cross-border inheritance tax can be
crippling for citizens, due to discrimination and double
taxation,” EU Taxation Commissioner Algirdas Semeta said in a
statement released in Brussels. “Small changes in member
states’ rules to make them more coherent with each other could
deliver real benefits for hundreds of thousands of people across
 Europe .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
