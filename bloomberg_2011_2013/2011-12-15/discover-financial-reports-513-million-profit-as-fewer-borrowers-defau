Discover Financial Services (DFS) , the
fourth-largest U.S. payments network, fell 3.2 percent as fiscal
fourth-quarter net interest margin narrowed.  Net income in the period ended Nov. 30 climbed 47 percent
to $513 million, or 95 cents a share, from $350 million, or 64
cents, a year earlier, the Riverwoods, Illinois-based company
said today in a statement. That beat the average estimate of 92
cents by 21 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Discover increased
the quarterly dividend 67 percent to 10 cents a share and
repurchased $227 million of stock during the quarter.  Net interest margin, the difference between what a firm
pays in deposits and charges for loans, narrowed to 9.1 percent
from 9.28 percent in the same quarter last year and 9.26 percent
in the previous quarter, according to the bank. Its purchase of
 student loans , which have lower yields, and new credit-card
regulations contributed to the shrinkage, Discover said.  “It never helps to have the NIM coming down on a quarter-
over-quarter basis,” Donald Fandetti, a Citigroup Inc. analyst,
said in a phone interview. “It was a beat, but there’s nothing
overly exciting.”  Discover fell 75 cents to $23.07 in  New York . The stock has
advanced 25 percent this year.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David Nelms, 50, has
sought to expand beyond Discover’s core card-lending and
processing businesses with the purchase of Student Loan Corp.
from New York-based Citigroup.  Purchases Increase  “We generated organic growth in all loan products, had
continued improvement in credit and demonstrated solid expense
control,” Nelms said in the statement.  Purchases made with Discover cards increased 8 percent to
$25 billion from a year earlier, the lender said. Net interest
income climbed 12 percent to $1.26 billion, and credit-card
loans rose 3 percent to $1.5 billion.  Write-offs for credit-card loans deemed uncollectible fell
to 3.04 percent in November from 6.72 percent in the same month
last year, according to regulatory filings. Loans at least 30
days overdue, a signal of future write-offs, dropped to 2.43
percent from 4.15 percent.  Discover posted a $319 million provision for losses on
soured loans, down from $383 million a year earlier. Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst with  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , had predicted
a $220 million provision. Net interest income increased 12
percent to $1.26 billion from the previous year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
