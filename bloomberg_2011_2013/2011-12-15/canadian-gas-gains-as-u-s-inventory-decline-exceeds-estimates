Canadian natural gas fell following
a U.S. report that inventories of the fuel are 10.3 percent
above five-year-average levels.  Alberta  gas declined 1 percent after the Energy Department
said stockpiles dropped 102 billion cubic feet to 3.729 trillion
last week, compared with a five-year average of 3.382 trillion.
Inventories had been expected to drop 92 billion, the median of
25 analyst estimates compiled by  Bloomberg.   “There’s still a whole lot of gas in storage,” said Eric Bickel, a natural gas analyst at Summit Energy Services in
Louisville,  Kentucky . Last week’s withdrawal “is not large
relative to history,” he said.  Alberta gas for January delivery slipped 3 cents to
C$2.9025 a gigajoule ($2.66 per million British thermal units)
as of 4:20 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX , a Canadian
Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.
NGX Alberta gas has slipped 21 percent this year.  Gas for January delivery fell 0.9 cent to settle at $3.127
per million Btu on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago fell
4.1 cents to $3.1989 per million Btu on the  Intercontinental
Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion
cubic feet a day to the Midwest from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas fell 2.94 cents to $3.2984, according to ICE. At
Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas was down 3.94 cents to $3.4634 per million Btu.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.7 billion cubic
feet, 239 million below its target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.74 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.94 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 576 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 2.08 billion cubic feet today, about 78 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.93
billion cubic feet at 3:20 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
