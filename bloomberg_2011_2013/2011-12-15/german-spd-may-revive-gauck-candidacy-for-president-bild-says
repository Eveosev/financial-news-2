Germany ’s opposition Social
Democrats may revive the candidacy of Joachim Gauck for the
presidency should the incumbent,  Christian Wulff , step down in
the wake of criticism over a personal loan, Bild says.  The newspaper didn’t say where it got the  information .
Wulff, who is from Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Christian
Democratic Union, has been accused by opposition leaders of
misleading lawmakers after Bild reported that he took a 500,000
euro ($650,000) home loan from a businessman friend’s wife.
Merkel’s spokesman said yesterday that the chancellor has full
confidence in the mainly ceremonial president.  Wulff, a former prime minister of the state of Lower
Saxony, defeated Gauck for the post in 2010. Gauck is a
Protestant pastor and former East German dissident who until
2000 was head of the agency that manages and makes public files
kept by the former East German Stasi secret police.  To contact the reporter on this story:
