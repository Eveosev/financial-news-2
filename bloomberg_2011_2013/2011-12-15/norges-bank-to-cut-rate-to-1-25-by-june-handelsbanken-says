Norway’s central bank, which
yesterday cut its  benchmark interest rate  by the most since May
2009, will lower the rate to 1.25 percent by June next year,
Svenska Handelsbanken AB said.  “Given the weak outlook for the eurozone, we believe
Norges Bank’s low  interest rate  scenario” from its monetary
policy report published in October was “too optimistic,” Kari Due-Andresen, a senior economist at Handelsbanken said in an e-
mailed note today. “We therefore believe the key policy rate
will be cut by 25 basis points both in March and June next year,
leaving the policy rate at 1.25 percent until well into 2013.”  Norges bank yesterday cut its key rate by 50 basis points
to 1.75 percent. DNB ASA said in a separate report today that
the central bank will lower its rate to 1.50 percent in March
and keep it at that level for the rest of the year.  Oslo-based DNB,  Norway ’s largest lender, cut its 2012
growth forecast for Norway’s mainland economy, which excludes
oil, gas and shipping, to 2.5 percent from an August forecast of
3.5 percent, citing weaker export demand. Growth this year is
estimated at 2.6 percent, compared with a 2.8 percent forecast
in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
