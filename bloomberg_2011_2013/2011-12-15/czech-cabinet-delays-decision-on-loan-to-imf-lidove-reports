The Czech government postponed a
decision yesterday on whether the country will provide funding
for a mechanism aimed at tackling the euro area’s debt crisis,
 Lidove Noviny  reported, citing Prime Minister Petr Necas.  The Cabinet needs more information before deciding on
providing a 3.5 billion euro loan to the  International Monetary
Fund , the newspaper said. The government didn’t say when it will
debate the issue again.  To contact the reporter on this story:
