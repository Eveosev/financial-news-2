JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  sold $1.25
billion of 30-year bonds as yields on the longest-maturity
investment-grade company debt are at about record lows.  The biggest U.S. bank by assets issued 5.4 percent
debentures that yield 250 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
JPMorgan has raised $4.25 billion by selling 30-year notes, the
most among its peers since issuance of the securities by banks
resumed in October 2010 after a 15-month pause, Bloomberg data
show.  JPMorgan, the most creditworthy of the six biggest U.S.
lenders in the eyes of derivatives traders, is taking advantage
of yields on investment-grade bonds due in 15 years that average
5.19 percent, after falling from 6.16 percent in February,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Banks
have sold $323.9 billion of debt in the U.S. this year, with 97
percent coming due within 10 years, Bloomberg data show.  Yields on the long-maturity debt reached a record low of
5.02 percent on Nov. 1.  In its last offering of 30-year bonds, New York-based
JPMorgan sold $1.75 billion of 5.6 percent debt that paid 140
basis points, or 1.4 percentage points, more than similar-
maturity Treasuries on July 14. The bank issued $1.25 billion of
5.5 percent, 30-year bonds at a 165 basis-point spread on Oct.
14, 2010.  Credit-default swaps on JPMorgan, which investors use to
hedge against losses on the company’s debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, fell to 149 basis points yesterday from 182
basis points on Nov. 25, according to data provider CMA. That
means investors pay $149,000 a year to protect $10 million of
the bank’s debt for five years.  Credit Swap Prices  Contracts on San Francisco-based  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  were at
150 while those for  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  reached 407. Swaps on
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  were 276, contracts protecting the debt of
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  traded at 322 and those on  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  were at 426, according to CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.
The contracts, which investors use to hedge against losses on
corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, decline as
investor confidence improves and rise as it deteriorates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
