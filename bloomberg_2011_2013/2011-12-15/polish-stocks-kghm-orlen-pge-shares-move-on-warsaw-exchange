Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  declined 12.62,
or 0.6 percent, to 2,161.32 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw.
The measure has plunged 21 percent this year.  The following were among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s sole copper and
silver producer, slumped 10 percent to 108.4 zloty, falling to a
15-month low after Poland published a draft of the new copper
extraction tax bill it wants to implement in 2012. Poland plans
to raise about 1.8 billion zloty ($517 million) from the tax and
2.2 billion zloty from the tax in the following years.  PGE SA (PGE)  , Poland’s largest utility, rose 0.9 percent
to 20.48 zloty, erasing earlier losses, after Chief Executive
Officer Tomasz Zadroga resigned and the supervisory board
dismissed Marek Szostek, the deputy chief executive in charge of
its trading division.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN)  , Poland’s biggest oil company, fell
1.1 percent to 35.63 zloty as oil reversed earlier gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
