European stocks  advanced, with the
benchmark Stoxx  Europe  600 Index rebounding from a two-week low,
amid speculation that this year’s slump in equities isn’t
commensurate with the outlook for corporate earnings. Asian
shares fell and U.S. index futures were little changed.  The  Stoxx 600  gained 0.2 percent to 232.94 at 8:10 a.m. in
 London . The decline in 2011 has left the Stoxx 600 trading at
10.1 times estimated profits, a discount of 16 percent to its
average price-earnings ratio of 12 over the past five years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The March futures
contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.1 percent
today, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index retreated 1.7 percent.  “The main risks to our outlook stem from Europe and
potential secondary consequences for global growth,”  Robert Buckland , the chief global strategist at Citigroup Inc. in
London, wrote in a report today. “Cheap valuations should
provide a buffer against further bad macro news.”  The Stoxx 600 fell to its lowest level since Nov. 29
yesterday as the U.S. Federal Reserve refrained from taking new
action to bolster the world’s largest economy. The gauge has
retreated 16 percent this year as the debt crisis spread to the
region’s larger economies.  Spain aims to sell as much as 3.5 billion euros ($4.5
billion) of bonds maturing in 2016, 2020, and 2021 today.
Economic data may show Germany’s manufacturing industry
contracted for a third straight month.  Concern grew that economic growth from  China  to  Japan  and
 South Korea  is slowing. Japan’s Tankan index of sentiment among
large manufacturers fell more than economists projected. South
Korean department store sales dropped for the first time in
almost three years and a preliminary purchasing managers’ index
showed China’s manufacturing may contract for a second month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
