Solarhybrid AG , a German developer
of solar projects, is in talks to raise about 280 million euros
($364 million) to build a 150-megawatt plant at an airbase
dating back to the Nazi era.  “There are different options available, including full
equity, full debt, and there’s high interest in the project,”
Chief Financial Officer Albert Klein said in a phone interview.  Solarhybrid has signed contracts to rent about half the
Neuhardenberg private airport in Brandenburg to develop the
project, the Brilon-based company said today in a statement on
its website. The power plant, which would be the company’s ninth
and biggest on former airfields, will be constructed and
connected to the grid by December 2012.  Built in 1934 as a secret airport, Neuhardenberg was at one
point used by the Luftwaffe to test rocket-propelled airplanes,
according to the airport’s  website . East Germany’s communist
army and then the country’s combined armed forces later used the
facility, which was privatized in 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
