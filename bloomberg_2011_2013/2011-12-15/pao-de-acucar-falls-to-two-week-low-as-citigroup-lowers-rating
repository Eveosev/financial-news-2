Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao
Grupo Pao de Acucar ,  Brazil ’s biggest retailer, fell to a two-
week low as Citigroup Inc. cut its recommendation to “neutral”
from “buy,” citing the stock’s valuation.  Shares dropped 2.6 percent to 64.49 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the lowest price since Nov. 29.  The outlook for Brazilian retailers in 2012 is “less
bullish” than in 2011 as the economy slows, leaving “little
upside” for Pao de Acucar, Carlos Albano, a Citigroup analyst
based in Sao Paulo, wrote in a note to clients dated yesterday.
“Recent stock performance brought valuations at much higher
levels where we don’t see much room for multiple expansion.”  The stock trades at 28 times Citigroup’s 2011 earnings
estimate for the company, more expensive than the ratio of 20.8
for smaller rival  Cia. Hering , according to the research note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
