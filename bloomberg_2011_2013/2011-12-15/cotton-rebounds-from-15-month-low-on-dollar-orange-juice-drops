Cotton rebounded from a 15-month low
as the dollar declined, renewing demand for commodities as
alternative investments.  Orange juice  retreated.  The greenback dropped as much as 0.6 percent against a six-
currency basket after U.S. economic data showed a quickening
recovery. The dollar had gained in the previous three sessions,
touching an 11-month high against the euro yesterday. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials rose as much 1
percent after tumbling 4.1 yesterday.  “With the dollar’s reversal, we’re going to see a bit of a
reversal in commodities,” Chris Kramedjian, a senior risk-
 management consultant  at INTL FCStone in Nashville, Tennessee,
said in a telephone interview. “Many people, including  hedge
funds , got out yesterday. With the weaker dollar, the ‘risk-on’
trade is back.”  Cotton futures for March delivery gained 1.4 percent to
settle at 86.29 cents a pound at 2:30 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in  New York . The fiber has plunged 40 percent this year. The
commodity touched 84.35 cents yesterday, the lowest since Aug.
24, 2010.  In the week ended Dec. 8, U.S. export sales totaled 45,662
bales, rebounding from net cancellations of 33,004 bales the
previous week, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today. A
bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  “Export sales were OK,”  Mike Stevens , an independent
trader in Mandeville, Louisiana said in an e-mail. “Shipments
are still lagging, and until cotton is shipped, it is subject to
cancellation. This continues to hang over the market.”  Orange-juice futures for January delivery slid 0.8 percent
to $1.664 a pound on ICE. The commodity has advanced 1.7 percent
this year, heading for a third straight annual gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
