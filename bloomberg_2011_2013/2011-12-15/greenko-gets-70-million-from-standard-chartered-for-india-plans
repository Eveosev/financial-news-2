Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  has agreed to
its first clean-energy investment in  India  by providing $70
million to  Greenko Group Plc (GKO)  to help develop as much as 1,000
megawatts of wind and hydropower projects.  The announcement made in a filing to the London Stock
Exchange today follows a $50 million investment by GE Energy
Financial Services in October.  Standard Chartered’s investment includes a portion of
convertible debt that may be exchanged for Greenko shares and
also entitles the bank to participate in the initial public
offering of any of Greenko’s units, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
