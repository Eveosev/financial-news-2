Gold extended a rout into a fourth
day as concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis is escalating boosted
the dollar, raising the prospect that the precious metal may
enter a  bear market . Platinum dropped to a two-year low.  Spot gold dropped 0.5 percent to $1,566.55 an ounce at 1:46
p.m. in  Singapore . The price lost 8 percent in the preceding
three days, and is set for the worst weekly fall since the
period to Sept. 23. The February-delivery contract dropped as
much as 1.2 percent to $1,567.60 on the Comex.  The dollar rose to an 11-month high against the euro
yesterday on signs of increased funding stress as Europe battles
its debt crisis, driving spot gold to $1,563.38, the lowest
level since Sept. 26. Gold dropped below its 200-day moving
average yesterday for the first time in almost three years,
indicating to some analysts that more declines may be in store.  “People are fearful of everything that’s going on, so once
something starts selling off, selling begets selling,” said
Rachel Benepe, a portfolio manager at First Eagle Investment
Management LLC. “The safe haven of choice continues to be the
 U.S. dollar ,” Benepe said in a Bloomberg Television interview.  Cash platinum fell for a fourth day, losing as much 3
percent to $1,378.50 an ounce, the lowest level since Nov. 13,
2009. Palladium also dropped for a fourth day, declining 0.5
percent to $615.25 an ounce.  Record Holdings  This week’s decline in gold has come even as holdings in
bullion-backed  exchange-traded funds  rose to an all-time high,
gaining 0.1 percent to 2,360.810 metric tons yesterday,
according to data tracked by Bloomberg.  Spot gold reached a record $1,921.15 in September, and a 20
percent decline from that peak -- regarded by some investors as
signaling a bear market -- would be a price of $1,536.92. Gold
has dropped 18 percent from the all-time high.  “Technically we’re looking weak,” said  Jonathan Barratt ,
managing director at Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney.
“As the U.S. dollar picked up strength, everyone just ran from
the market.”  Mining shares dropped.  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) ,  Australia ’s
biggest producer, fell for a fifth day, losing as much as 4.2
percent to A$30.47. Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s top producer,
lost 3.8 percent in Toronto yesterday, the most in a month.  Gold is still set for an 11th year of gains after investors
sought to protect their wealth from weaker currencies, falling
equities and rising inflation. Within that rally there have been
bear-market slumps. In 2008, spot gold tumbled 34 percent from a
then-record $1,032.70 in March to the year’s low in October.  ‘Fighting Chance’  The metal remains one of the top commodity picks for 2012
as “most of the factors that pushed gold higher in 2011 are not
going away,” according to UBS AG, which expects it to average
$2,050 an ounce next year. “So long as uncertainty abounds,
gold has a fighting chance of outpacing many asset classes,”
analysts including Julien Garran wrote in a report yesterday.  Gold’s so-called 14-day relative-strength index was at
27.21 today. The index last dropped below a level of 30, a
signal that prices may rebound, in September 2008.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said that there is no easy
solution to the European sovereign-debt crisis after rejecting
an increase in the upper limit of funding for the region’s
permanent bailout mechanism. The euro fell below $1.30 for the
first time since January, and traded at $1.2988 today.  Spot silver declined for a fourth day, dropping as much as
1.8 percent to $28.40 an ounce, the lowest level since Sept. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
