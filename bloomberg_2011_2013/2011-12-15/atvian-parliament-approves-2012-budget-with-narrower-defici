The Latvian Parliament approved the
2012 state budget, trimming the deficit below the European
Union’s limit as the Baltic nation prepares to adopt the euro in
2014.  The legislature voted 56-42 today in Riga to pass the
budget with a shortfall of 2.5 percent of economic output, below
the EU’s 3 percent ceiling, and down from an expected 4.5
percent this year. The plan, economic growth of 2.5 percent, is
the final budget in the country’s 7.5 billion-euro ($9.7
billion) lending program from a group led by the European
Commission and the  International Monetary Fund .  Latvia turned to the lenders in late 2008 after its second-
biggest bank needed a state rescue and a real-estate bubble
burst. The government has adopted spending cuts and tax
increases of 2.3 billion lati ($4.3 billion), or 17.8 percent of
GDP, since seeking aid.  “We did a great job of lowering the fiscal deficit, and
this consolidation amount is huge,” said Finance Minister
Andris Vilks, in a telephone interview today. “No one is going
to follow us in such categories.”  The Baltic country came to a staff-level agreement with its
lenders on Dec. 8 for a fifth and final review of the lending
program, which will be completed this year. The estimate for 2.5
percent economic growth is “too optimistic” because conditions
in the euro area are deteriorating, central bank Governor Ilmars Rimsevics said on Dec. 6.  Slowing Growth  Growth may slow to 1 percent next year according to
estimates from Citadele Banka AS and Nordea AB. Estonia’s
central bank yesterday cut its forecast for growth to 1.9
percent for 2012, compared with a June forecast for a 4.2
percent expansion, and said the bank’s negative scenario was for
a 4 percent contraction.  “Our trading partners are going to grow at the level of
1.5 percent to 2 percent at least. Therefore 2.5 percent for
Latvia doesn’t seem very optimistic,” Vilks said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
