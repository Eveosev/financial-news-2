Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  is seeking a “total takeover” of the central bank with a
bill aimed at regulating the institution, Magyar Nemzeti Bank
President Andras Simor told the news website Index.  The draft law breaks EU rules and harms the central bank’s
independence, Simor said, according to a transcript of the
interview posted on the website today.  “This is the latest and almost total takeover of the
central bank, since the law vacates and eliminates the mandate
of the current president and vice presidents,” Simor said.  The Economy Ministry this week submitted the bill, which
would expand the rate-setting Monetary Council to as many as
nine members from seven, according to the  draft  posted on
Parliament’s website. The central bank chief would have to cede
powers, including naming vice presidents, which would belong to
the prime minister and the country’s president.  Hungary may create a new institution through the merger of
the central bank and the financial regulator, in which Simor
would be a deputy chief, according to a separate ruling-party
proposal. Legislators will vote on this tomorrow.  The plan may be aimed at “deflecting attention” from the
central bank bill, Simor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
