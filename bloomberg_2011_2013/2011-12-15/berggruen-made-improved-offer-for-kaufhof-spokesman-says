Berggruen Holdings, the owner of
German department-store chain Karstadt, said it made an improved
offer with  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  for  Metro AG’s  Kaufhof stores.  A spokesman for Berggruen declined to comment further on
the bid, which was previously reported by Handelsblatt. The
suitor said on Nov. 22 that it joined forces with New York-based
Blackstone to make an offer for Kaufhof.  Berggruen is competing with Signa Holding GmbH, an Austrian
real-estate company managed by investor Rene Benko. Metro, the
Dusseldorf-based owner of Real hypermarkets, has been seeking a
buyer for Kaufhof since 2008 and said in August it may sell the
chain or form an alliance for the unit. The retailer’s
supervisory board is scheduled to meet tomorrow.  “It’s not clear what the bids are, but at this stage the
price is, in my opinion, the most important factor,” said
 Robert Greil , an analyst at Merck Finck & Co. in Munich. “I
don’t think Metro is under pressure to close the deal this year
and I don’t expect the company to decide tomorrow.”  A spokesman for Metro confirmed that Berggruen made a bid
for Kaufhof. He asked not to be named, citing company policy.  Metro shares gained 2 percent to 27.93 euros as of the 5:30
p.m. close of trading in  Frankfurt . The  stock  has fallen 48
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
