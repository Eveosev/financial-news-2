The  Swiss Federal Criminal Court 
found a former  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  employee guilty of
business espionage and breaking banking secrecy laws in a case
brought jointly by the Zurich-based bank and a state prosecutor.  A judge gave the employee, identified only by the initial
A, a 24-month suspended sentence and a 3,500 Swiss-franc
($3,708) fine, according to an e-mailed statement with details
of today’s judgment in the court in Bellinzona,  Switzerland .  The man on trial was a former Credit Suisse employee who
leaked customer account information to an accomplice, Swiss
newspaper NZZ am Sonntag reported Dec. 11. An Austrian man held
in connection with the theft of Swiss bank-account data and its
sale to  Germany  killed himself in prison in September 2010.  “Credit Suisse welcomes the fact that the proceedings
relating to the theft of client data have been conducted and
completed and that the perpetrator has received a criminal
sentence for the offense,” said  Marc Dosch , a spokesman for
Switzerland’s second-biggest bank.  Swiss banking-secrecy laws dating back to 1934 prevent bank
employees from sharing client details with foreign governments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
