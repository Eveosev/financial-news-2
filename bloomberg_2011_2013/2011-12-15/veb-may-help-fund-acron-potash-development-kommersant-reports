VEB , Russia’s state development bank
chaired by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, may decide tomorrow to
help fund  OAO Acron ’s biggest potash deposit,  Kommersant 
reported, citing people it didn’t identify.  VEB may spend 6.7 billion rubles ($210 million) to buy 20
percent in Acron’s Verkhnekamsk Potash Company, which develops
the Talitsky potash deposit in Perm region, and lend $1.1
billion for six years to help develop the field, the newspaper
said. The interest may be set at 6.5 percent over the London
interbank offered rate, Kommersant said.  Acron will have to find a buyer for a 29 percent stake in
the project, the newspaper said. VEB’s board may meet tomorrow
to discuss the matter, according to Kommersant.  Acron spokeswoman Elena Kochubey and VEB’s press office
declined to comment when called by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
