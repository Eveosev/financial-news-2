KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., the
investment banking arm of KeyCorp, hired Steve Rielly to run
loan trading as it builds its credit sales and trading business.  Rielly, a former global head of loan trading at UBS AG,
will be based in  New York  and start in January, Ray Lemanski,
New York-based head of high yield at KeyBanc, said today in a
telephone interview. Rielly declined to comment.  The bank has boosted its credit business in the past 12
months by adding staff including a high-yield bond trader and
seven salesmen, Lemanski said.  KeyBanc has led $277.5 million of high-yield offerings this
year in two transactions, up from no sales in 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It has arranged $7.3 billion of
leveraged loans through 59 issues this year, compared with $1.7
billion in 2009, according to the data.  Rielly was most recently the head U.S. loan trader at
Nomura Securities International, a unit of Nomura Holdings Inc.
He was hired last year to help set up a loan sales and trading
group in New York for the Japanese firm.  Before joining Nomura, Rielly worked at the PrinceRidge
Group, responsible for par and distressed loan trading. He was
at UBS from 2000 to 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
