KfW Group,  Germany ’s state-owned
lender, said it will supply 50 million euros ($65 million) for
projects in  East Africa  to tap underground heat for use as a
renewable energy source.  KfW’s development bank signed a contract with the  African
Union  to supply financing for exploratory drillings in East
Africa to attract geothermal investments, KfW said today in an
e-mail. Funding also includes European Union money, it said.  East Africa supplies 60 percent of its power with hydro
plants that are backed by costlier and dirtier diesel generators
when drought occurs, KfW said. The region’s geothermal potential
is more than 7,000 megawatts, almost double its current power
generation capacity, it said.  “Expanding geothermal energy sources leads to emissions-
free power generation and lower energy costs,” said Norbert Kloppenburg, a KfW board member.  To contact the reporter on this story:
