The holding company H51, set up to
defend  Hermes International (RMS)  SCA against a possible takeover,
will meet before shareholder meetings to determine how it will
vote its majority stake, as the Hermes founding family did
before H51’s formation, Le Figaro reported today, citing an
interview with H51 President Julie Guerrand.  The risk of a share price drop doesn’t concern the family
because they aren’t interested in selling their shares, Guerrand
said, according to Le Figaro.  Relations between Hermes and  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton SA (MC)  have improved since LVMH announced in October 2010
that it had acquired a stake in Hermes, Le Figaro said, citing
Bertrand Puech, who heads the family. Still, their philosophies
are “totally different” and H51 wants LVMH to exit, Puech
said, according to the newspaper.  Hermes Chief Executive Officer  Patrick Thomas  has three
years before retirement and while his successor needn’t be a
family member, the appointment will be decided by the family,
the newspaper cited Puech as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
