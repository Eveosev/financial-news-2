Soc. Quimica & Minera de Chile SA ,
 Chile ’s largest fertilizer producer, posted the longest losing
streak in three years as Morgan Stanley recommended an
“underweight” position for investors on its valuation versus
peers and expectations for slower demand from potash buyers.  Soquimich, as the company is also known, retreated 0.2
percent to 26,494 pesos at the close in Santiago, its ninth
consecutive day of losses.  Morgan Stanley cut the stock from “equalweight” and set a
2012 price estimate of $50 per American depositary receipt,
citing potential reductions in demand for potash from major
consumers India and  China , and valuation multiples for
fertilizer companies.  “After a strong 2011 for potash, we expect a tougher
2012,” analysts Javier Martinez, Wesley Brooks and Wendell
Goncalves wrote in a note to clients dated today. “With grain
prices off 20 percent and an uncertain macro outlook, buyers
will likely delay/reduce purchases.”  Relative valuation versus peers also will limit gains, the
analysts wrote. Soquimich trades at 17.3 times its enterprise
value over earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization, compared with 8.82 times for  Potash Corp of
Saskatchewan Inc. (POT)  and 5.36 times for The  Mosaic Co. (MOS) , according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
