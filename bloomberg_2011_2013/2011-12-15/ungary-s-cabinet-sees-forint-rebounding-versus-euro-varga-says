Hungary’s government expects the
forint to strengthen “sooner or later” against the euro,
 Mihaly Varga , Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s chief of staff, said
today.  At the same time, the cabinet’s reworking of the budget on
the basis of a lower economic growth forecast for next year
provides an opportunity to recalculate the forint projection as
well, Varga told Budapest-based TV2 in an interview.  The proposed merger of the central bank and the financial
regulator may help to create a “stricter,” more efficient
system, Varga added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
