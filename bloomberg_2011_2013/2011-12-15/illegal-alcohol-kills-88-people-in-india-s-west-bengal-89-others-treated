At least 102 people died after
drinking illegally distilled liquor in  India , where alcohol
tainted with industrial chemicals every year kills poor
villagers unable to afford licensed brands.  A further 75 people were being treated for alcohol
poisoning in hospitals near the  West Bengal  village of
Sangrampur, M. Das, a police spokesman in the state capital
Kolkata, said in an interview. The death toll is expected to
rise as many people are a serious condition. Four people have
been arrested for selling the poisonous brew, he said.  In 2009, at least 107 people died in western Gujarat state
and another 30 in northern  Uttar Pradesh  after drinking toxic
alcohol, according to a report by the British Broadcasting Corp.
today.  South 24 Parganas, the West Bengal district where the
alcohol was consumed, is about a three-hour drive from the state
capital Kolkata. The local government has announced compensation
of 200,000 rupees ($3,692) for each victim.  Most of the dead were poor laborers and rickshaw-pullers,
Press Trust of India reported. The state health department has
canceled all leave for doctors to cope with the situation, the
 news agency  said.  The deaths come a week after India’s deadliest fire in
seven years killed 91 people at a hospital in Kolkata.  To contact the reporters on this story:
