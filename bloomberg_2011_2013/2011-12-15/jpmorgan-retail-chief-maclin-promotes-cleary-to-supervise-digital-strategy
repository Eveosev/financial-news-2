JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
and most profitable U.S. bank, named Michael Cleary to a new
position running the retail unit’s digital, online and mobile
strategy.  “Customers’ use of Internet and mobile banking has
skyrocketed,” Todd Maclin, the chief executive officer of
JPMorgan’s retail unit, said in an internal memo to employees
today. “In fact, three quarters of our customers actively use
chase.com and active mobile households have more than doubled
since the first quarter of 2010.”  Cleary, who previously ran small-business lending, will
handle the retail bank’s Internet and mobile teams, according to
the memo. He will work with Paul Heller, head of the corporate
Internet group; Jack Stephenson, who runs mobile e-commerce; and
Guy Chiarello, who supervises technology across the company.
Maclin cited Cleary’s expansion of business banking in growth
markets such as California, Florida and  Texas .  Scott Geller, chief risk officer for New York-based
JPMorgan’s commercial bank, will replace Cleary in overseeing
lending to companies with less than $20 million in annual
revenue. A successor for Geller is being sought, Maclin wrote.
The retail bank lends money to businesses with less than $20
million in annual revenue while the commercial bank lends money
to middle-market companies with revenue of $20 million to about
$2 billion.  Patrick Linehan, a spokesman for JPMorgan, confirmed the
contents of the memo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
