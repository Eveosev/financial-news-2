Swedish  employment  fell for a fourth
month in November as  Europe ’s debt crisis saps momentum in the
largest Nordic economy, giving the central bank more scope to
cut  interest rates  next week.  Total employment fell to 4.629 million people from 4.635
million in October, Stockholm-based  Statistics Sweden  said
today. The non-seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 6.7
percent from 6.9 percent a month earlier, as more people left
the labor market. The  median forecast  of thirteen economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for 6.8 percent unemployment.  “The deteriorating labor market is an important reason why
we expect the Riksbank to cut rates below 1 percent next year,”
said Torbjoern Isaksson, an analyst at Nordea Bank AB, in a note
to clients.  The Riksbank has left its benchmark interest rate unchanged
at 2 percent since July and in October signaled fewer increases
next year as Europe’s debt crisis threatens to stall growth.
 Norway ’s central bank yesterday unexpectedly cut its main rate
by 0.5 percentage point to 1.75 percent, fueling speculation the
Riksbank will also lower rates.  “Despite continued solid growth in the Swedish economy,
the pressure on the Riksbank to lower its repo rate has
increased,” Erica Blomgren, an analyst at SEB AB, said in a
note before today’s unemployment data.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
