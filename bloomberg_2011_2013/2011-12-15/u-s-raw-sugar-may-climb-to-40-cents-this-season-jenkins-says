Prices for U.S. domestic raw-sugar
may climb to 38 cents a pound to 40 cents during the season that
started on Oct. 1, according to Frank Jenkins, the president of
Wilton, Connecticut-based Jenkins Sugar Group Inc.  Domestic refined-sugar prices may trade from 53 cents and
58 cents by next summer, Jenkins said during a presentation at a
conference in  New York .  Import quotas will be a driving factor in the domestic
sugar market, Jenkins said. The sweetener is the only major
agricultural commodity produced in the U.S. that is subject to
import quotas.  Next season’s prices will be highly “dependent on weather
in both the U.S. and  Mexico ,” Jenkins said. Raw sugar may
retreat to 24 cents, while refined sweetener may fall to 35
cents, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
