The Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia’s  general economic index  increased to 10.3 in
December from 3.6 last month. Readings greater than zero
indicate expansion in the area covering eastern  Pennsylvania ,
southern  New Jersey  and Delaware.  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast the gauge
would rise to 5, according to the median of 57 estimates that
ranged from zero to 12.  Another report today from the Fed showed industrial
production in the U.S. unexpectedly dropped in November for the
first time in seven months. Output at factories, mines and
utilities declined 0.2 percent after a 0.7 percent gain in
October.  Factory production, which makes up 75 percent of the total,
decreased 0.4 percent, also the first decline since April.  Manufacturing in the New York region in December expanded
the most in seven months as measures of employment and orders
improved, another report showed. The Federal Reserve Bank of  New
York ’s  general economic index  rose to 9.5 from 0.6 in November.  The labor market is showing signs of improvement. The
number of applications for  unemployment benefits  unexpectedly
dropped last week to the lowest level in three years. Jobless
claims declined by 19,000 to 366,000 in the week ended Dec. 10,
Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
