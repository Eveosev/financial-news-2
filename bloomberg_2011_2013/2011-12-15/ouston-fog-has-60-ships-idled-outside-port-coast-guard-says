About 92 vessels are waiting to pass
through the Houston and Sabine ship channels in Texas after fog
hampered visibility, according to the U.S. Coast Guard and a
pilots group.  The Houston Channel Pilots Association doesnâ€™t expect to
move wide-bodied ships such as Aframax and Suezmax vessels today
if the fog clears, said Steve Miner, a dispatcher for the group.
The pilots will begin boarding and moving smaller ships through
the waterway if conditions clear today, he said.  There are about 10 Aframax- and Suezmax-size tanker vessels
waiting to enter the channel, destined for ports operated by
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Miner said.  About 60 vessels are waiting to enter the  Houston Ship
Channel  and 10 are waiting to leave the waterway, which leads to
the largest U.S. petroleum port, Phillip Woods, a Coast Guard
watch supervisor, said in an interview earlier today. Operations
were suspended Dec. 13, and some vessels departed yesterday
during a break in the weather, he said.  There are 13 vessels waiting to enter the Sabine Ship
Channel, Derek Rutherford, a dispatcher with the pilots
association that guides the ships through that waterway, said in
a telephone interview. Nine are waiting to leave, he said.  Ships move from the  Gulf of Mexico  through the Sabine
channel to supply oil to refineries owned by  Valero Energy
Corp. (VLO) , Total SA and Motiva Enterprises LLC in Port Arthur and by
Exxon Mobil Corp. in Beaumont.  To contact the reporters on this story:
