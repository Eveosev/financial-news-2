Brazilian lawmakers may abolish a
federal tax on biodiesel next year that would allow the
renewable fuel to compete in price with petroleum-based diesel.  The legislation would rescind the industrial products tax
on biodiesel sales and may take effect in the first half of
2012, Congressman Jeronimo Goergen said today in a telephone
interview from Brasilia.  “Biodiesel would become competitive,” Goergen said. “We
need to reduce production costs because for everyone, producers
and consumers, it’s too expensive.” Goergen didn’t say how much
the proposed legislation would bring down production costs.  Brazil  started running its vehicle fleet on biodiesel at
the start of 2008 to reduce dependence on fuel imports.
Distributors are obligated to buy the fuel in auctions because
it’s more expensive than normal diesel, said Goergen, who
represents Brazil’s southern state of  Rio Grande  do Sul.  Brazilian diesel  cost  1.36 reais (73 cents) a liter on
average at the pump for the week ended Nov. 13, according to
information compiled by Bloomberg.  Biodiesel plants sold output at an average of 2.40 reais a
liter at an auction for the fuel held on Aug. 24, fuel regulator
Agencia Nacional do Petroleo, Gas Natural e Biocombustiveis said
on its  website .  “There are taxes one on top of another in Brazil making
everything more expensive,” Goergen said. The legislation
“would mark an end for federal taxes on biodiesel across the
supply chain.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
