The U.K. military will provide
13,500 personnel to assist with security at next year’s London
Olympic Games, Defense Secretary Philip Hammond said.  The police and civil authorities will be helped by staff
with specialist skills, including bomb-disposal teams and dog
handlers, with 1,000 on standby in case of an “Olympics-related
civil emergency,” Hammond said in an e-mailed statement today.
 HMS Ocean , the Royal Navy’s biggest ship, will be moored at
Greenwich in the  River Thames  to provide support, accommodation
and a helicopter landing site.  “The Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force between them
will provide up to 13,500 personnel,” Hammond said. “Up to
7,500 of them will support the smooth running of Olympic sites,
while the remainder will use their specialist capabilities and
equipment to contribute to the delivery of Olympic security.”  Typhoon jets will be stationed at the RAF’s Northolt base
in northwest London to assist with airspace security along with
helicopters from HMS Ocean, the ministry said. Hammond told
lawmakers last month that the government will station ground-to-
air missiles in  London  if necessary to protect the games.  “The 13,500 is the maximum number we can provide without
having an impact on other operations,” Hammond told Sky News
television. “This is the biggest security challenge this
country has faced for decades.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
