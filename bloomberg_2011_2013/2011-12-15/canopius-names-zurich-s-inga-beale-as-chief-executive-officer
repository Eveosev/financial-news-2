Canopius Group Ltd. , the Lloyd’s of
 London  insurer owned by Bregal Capital LLP, named Inga Beale to
be its chief executive officer from next month.  Beale will replace current chairman and CEO Michael Watson,
who becomes executive chairman, Canopius said in a statement on
its website. She is the former CEO of  Scor SE (SCR) ’s Swiss unit and
was most recently the global chief underwriting officer at
 Zurich Financial Services AG. (ZURN)  Jim Giordano will continue in his
role as chief underwriting officer, Canopius said.  Beale will assume ultimate responsibility for all of
Canopius’s business in the U.K. and overseas. Watson is leaving
the CEO role following Canopius’s Oct. 20 withdrawal from a
bidding war for Omega Insurance Holding Ltd, which endorsed a
rival bid from Haverford (Bermuda) Ltd.  “For the past eight years, Jim Giordano and I have
overseen the group’s operations,” Watson said in the statement.
“We believe the scale and complexity of Canopius now require
that we add an additional member to our most senior ranks to
oversee the next stage of our development.”  Beale, who was also in charge of “organizational
transformation” at Zurich Financial, left  Switzerland ’s biggest
insurer in June after joining the company in 2008 as head of
mergers and acquisitions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
