Romania’s government  approved a 4.5
percent increase in the national minimum gross wage from
Jan. 1, according to an e-mailed statement.  The minimum wage will rise to 700 lei ($209) from 670 lei
to cover next year’s estimated increase in consumer prices and
will affect about 790,677 workers, the government said in the
statement late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
