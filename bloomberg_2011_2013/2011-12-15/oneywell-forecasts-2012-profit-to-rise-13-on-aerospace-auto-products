Honeywell International Inc. (HON) 
forecast a 13 percent rise in 2012 earnings as emerging-market
growth offsets a slump in  Europe  and increased demand for
commercial aircraft boosts profit at its aerospace unit.  Sales from existing businesses at the  Morris Township , New
Jersey-based company are expected to expand 4 percent or less in
the U.S. and Europe, while growing as much as 12 percent in the
rest of the world, Chief Financial Officer  David Anderson  said
today. Honeywell’s aerospace unit will boost profit by as much
as $200 million on increased  Boeing Co. (BA)  and Airbus SAS
production, Anderson said on a call with analysts.  Honeywell, whose products range from home thermostats to
aircraft parts, is benefiting from a push into  emerging markets 
since Dave Cote took over as chief executive officer in 2002,
Anderson said. The percentage of Honeywell’s sales outside
Europe and the U.S. has expanded to 26 percent from 16 percent
in 2003.  “Our investments and focus on emerging regions’ expansion
is paying off,” Anderson said. “From the data indicators we’re
watching, it’s pretty clear that we’ll experience European
recession in 2012.”  The company expects global economic growth of 3 percent,
with developed markets expanding up to 2 percent and emerging
markets increasing as much as 6 percent, the CFO said. Earnings
growth will outpace an estimated sales expansion of as much as
6.6 percent next year as profit margins increase, with the help
of $150 million in savings from business restructuring, he said.  Control Systems  In addition to growth in Aerospace, Honeywell’s  Automation
& Control Solutions  unit will add as much as $200 million to
profit on growth in energy and commercial construction, Anderson
said.  “We expect the orders trends to continue strong into 2012
as the long-term demand for these businesses is fueled by
growing energy demand, global travel and also urbanization,”
Anderson said.  Honeywell said today it predicts earnings of $4.25 to $4.50
a share next year, compared with its 2011 forecast of $4 to
$4.05. Analysts predicted $4.42 for 2012, the average of 21
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The high end of Honeywell’s 2012 sales forecast matched the
average analysts’ estimate compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue will
rise as much as 6.6 percent to $38.9 billion, according to the
statement.  Profit margins next year are expected to expand 40 to 70
basis points from 2011 even with pricing that will be a
“headwind” next year, Anderson said. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  A backlog of almost $16 billion and strong aerospace
aftermarket demand may allow the company to grow faster than its
end markets, Robert Stallard, a New York-based analyst with  RBC
Capital Markets , wrote in a note today. He rates the shares
“outperform.”  ‘Record Backlog’  “Honeywell’s view of 2012 confirms slowing growth against
2011, but we think this is generally in line with expectations
and its record backlog should protect performance,” said
Stallard, who has an “outperform” rating on the company.  Honeywell advanced 1.7 percent to $52.41 at the close in
 New York . The shares have declined 1.4 percent this year.  In October, the company increased the 2011 profit forecast
after sales for the first nine months rose 25 percent at the
transportation-systems unit and 18 percent at the specialty-
materials division. Sales advanced 17 percent at the largest
unit, automation & control solutions, while aerospace gained 7.3
percent in revenue as business aircraft equipment offset
weakness in defense.  The company in July sold its Consumer Products Group, the
maker of Fram filters and Prestone antifreeze, for about $955
million. The proceeds are offsetting costs of restructuring
businesses in Europe, where demand has fallen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
