A 12-hour strike by Cypriot air
traffic controllers in protest over the government’s austerity
measures is disrupting flights to and from Cyprus, Adamos
Aspris, a spokesman for Larnaca and Paphos airports, said.  “A total of 79 flights to and from Cyprus scheduled for
today are affected by the strike that started at 9 a.m.,”
Aspris said in a telephone interview today. The number of
canceled flights can’t be determined yet, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
