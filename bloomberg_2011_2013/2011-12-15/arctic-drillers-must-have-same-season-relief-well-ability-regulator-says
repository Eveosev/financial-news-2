Canada ’s National Energy Board is
maintaining its policy that any  oil company  drilling off
Canada’s Arctic coast must be able to drill a relief well in the
same season to minimize environmental risks.  Canada’s energy regulator reviewed the policy after BP
Plc’s Macondo well spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the worst
offshore  oil spill  in U.S. history. The report issued today
affirms a rule that’s been in place for at least three decades.  There’s no offshore drilling in the Canadian Arctic.
Interest in drilling for oil under the  Arctic Ocean  has picked
up as conventional reserves diminish. The region may hold 90
billion barrels of oil, more than the combined known reserves of
Nigeria, Kazakhstan and  Mexico , the U.S. Geological Survey said
in 2008.  Neighboring Greenland has raised the number of oil and gas
licenses awarded 10-fold since 2005, while other Arctic nations
such as Russia, Iceland and the U.S. are looking at
opportunities to exploit fossil fuels under the ice.  The U.S. in May pushed for the eight-member Arctic Council
to create an oil spill response task force. The council is under
pressure to take measures after the Macondo accident and signed
its first internationally binding agreement earlier this year
with a search-and-rescue treaty.  The Canadian regulator also set out guidelines today on
dealing with waste management, pollution monitoring and spill
contingency plans. The report was issued in Calgary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
