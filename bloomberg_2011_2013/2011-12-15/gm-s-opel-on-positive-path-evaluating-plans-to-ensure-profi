General Motors Co. (GM) ’s  Adam Opel AG 
unit is evaluating strategies to ensure that it’s profitable
even in a slowdown, the European company said today.  Opel is on “a positive path,” its executive board,
supervisory board and workers’ council said.  “Thanks to our excellent model line-up, which will be
modernized even further with six new introductions in 2012, we
are sure that we can build on our upward market trend,” the
three bodies said in a joint statement.  Opel said it issued the statement in response to a  report 
in Germany’s Capital magazine citing an internal evaluation by
the company as suggesting it would record a 1 billion-euro ($1.3
billion) shortfall in operating profit in the coming year.  Opel will produce 1.4 million vehicles in 2012, less than
anticipated in a plan to lift output to 1.6 million units by
2014, Capital said. Plants in Bochum,  Germany , and Ellesmere
Port, Britain, may close as developments of the Astra model are
scrapped, it said, citing people with knowledge of the business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
