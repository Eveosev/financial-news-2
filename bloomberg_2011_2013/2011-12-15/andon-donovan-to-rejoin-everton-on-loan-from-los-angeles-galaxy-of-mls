Everton reached an agreement to
bring  Landon Donovan , the all-time leading goal scorer for the
U.S. national soccer team, back to the club on a two-month loan.  Donovan, 29, will join later this month and be eligible for
the Toffees’ Jan. 4 game against Bolton, the Premier League club
said on its  website . He’ll return to the  Los Angeles Galaxy 
following Everton’s Feb. 25 game against city rival Liverpool.  Donovan, who’s scored a record 46 goals in 138 matches for
the U.S., netted twice in 13 appearances for Everton during a
three-month loan spell in 2010.  “I am delighted we have managed to get Landon back,”
Everton manager David Moyes said. “He did well for us when he
was over two years ago and hopefully will return with those same
qualities.”  Donovan scored 16 times for the Galaxy last season,
including the only goal in last month’s MLS Cup final win over
Houston. He ranks third in MLS history with 115 goals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
