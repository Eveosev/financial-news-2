Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the fourth-
largest U.S. bank by assets, said it agreed to purchase EverKey
Global Partners to offer clients a greater variety of investment
strategies.  EverKey’s 11-person staff led by Jeff Everett, former chief
investment officer of Templeton Global Advisors Ltd., will
become part of Wells Fargo’s asset-management group, the San
Francisco-based bank said today in a statement. EverKey oversees
about $215 million through global equity strategies including a
long/short approach, Laura Fay, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said
in a phone interview.  “We remain focused on broadening our investment
capabilities to meet the needs of our clients,” Mike Niedermeyer, head of Wells Fargo’s asset-management group, said
in the statement.  The purchase of EverKey furthers Wells Fargo’s strategy of
making a collection of autonomous boutique investment firms and
strategies available to clients. The asset-management group
oversaw $449 billion at the end of September through such units
as Wells Capital Management, European Credit Management Ltd. and
Golden Capital Management LLC, a quantitative investment
manager, according to the statement.  The transaction is expected to close Jan. 1, Wells Fargo
said. EverKey has offices in  New York  and the Bahamas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
