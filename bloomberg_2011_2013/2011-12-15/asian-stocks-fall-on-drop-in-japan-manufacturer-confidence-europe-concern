Asian stocks fell for a third day
amid signs of slowing economic growth in  China  and  Japan , and as

positive direction,” said Naoteru Teraoka, general manager at

factors. The euro has fallen a lot against the yen, which is
another headache for exporters.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1.6 percent to 111.49 as
of 5:48 p.m. in  Tokyo , with almost five shares falling for each
