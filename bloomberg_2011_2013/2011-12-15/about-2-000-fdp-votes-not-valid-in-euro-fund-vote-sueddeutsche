About 2,000 votes out of a total of
22,000 in  Germany ’s Free Democratic Party’s vote on the euro
bailout fund have not been included as of yesterday as
membership for the party couldn’t be proven,  Sueddeutsche
Zeitung  reported in a preview of a story that will be published
tomorrow.  About a third of the party’s members participated in the
vote, the German newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
