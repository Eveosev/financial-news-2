The U.K. Department for Transport
said it won’t require drivers to hold a paper counterpart to
their licenses from 2015, a move aimed at easing bureaucracy.  The government also said it’s asking insurers whether
there’s a way to remove the requirement for drivers to have
certificate proof of insurance on their car. In addition, it
will make it easier for car owners to pay their annual road tax
online.  “Motorists shouldn’t have to keep numerous bits of paper
just to prove they can drive and have bought insurance,”
Transport Secretary Justine Greening said in an e-mailed
statement. “We live in a digital age and we need to embrace
that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
