Alibaba Group Holding Ltd . is
considering a loan from a group of banks comprising Credit
Suisse Group AG, DBS Bank Ltd., Deutsche Bank AG and Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd., according to three people familiar with the
matter.  The decision on the final group of banks hasnâ€™t been made,
said the people, asking not to be identified because the details
are private. Alibaba and  Softbank Corp. (9984)  are considering
acquisition options related to Yahoo! Inc., the largest U.S.
internet portal, three other people familiar with the matter
said on Dec. 1. Yahoo owns about 40 percent of Alibaba, the top
e-commerce site in  China , and 35 percent of Yahoo  Japan .  Alibaba may seek to buy back the stake Yahoo owns, while
Softbank may seek to acquire the stake in Yahoo Japan, one of
those three people said earlier this month. Alibaba and Softbank
are also considering a full buyout of Yahoo and are in advanced
talks with Blackstone Group LP and Bain Capital LLC about making
a bid for the whole company, the three people said on Dec. 1.  The loan could be about $4 billion, one of the people said
today.  John Spelich, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Hangzhou-
based Alibaba, declined to comment when contacted today by
telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
