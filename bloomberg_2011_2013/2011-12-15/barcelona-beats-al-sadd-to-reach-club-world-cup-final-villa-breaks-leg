European soccer champion Barcelona
beat Qatar’s Al-Sadd 4-0 today to reach the final of the FIFA
Club World Cup, where it will play Santos of  Brazil .  Adriano got two goals for the Spanish club in Yokohama,
Japan, with Seydou Keita and Maxwell also scoring. Barcelona’s
win was marred by a broken left leg for striker  David Villa .  Barcelona is aiming to become the fifth straight European
winner of the  annual competition , which is contested by the
champions of each continent’s soccer federation. Japan’s Kashiwa
Reysol also qualified for this year’s tournament as winner of
the host nation’s J League.  Adriano got both his goals in the first half today, the
first when an attempted clearance by goalkeeper Mohamed Saqr was
hit straight at the Brazilian and rebounded into the net.  Before Adriano doubled the lead just before halftime,
Barcelona had already had to replace Villa. Barcelona confirmed
on its website that Villa fractured the tibia in his left leg in
a tackle on 39 minutes.  Keita scored after 64 minutes, with substitute Maxwell
getting the final goal with nine minutes remaining.  Barcelona, the 2009 champion,  will face Santos on Dec. 18 
in Yokohama. Santos yesterday beat Kashiwa 3-1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
