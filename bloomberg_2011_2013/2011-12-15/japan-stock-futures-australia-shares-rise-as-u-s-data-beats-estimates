Japanese  stock (MXAP)   futures  and
Australian shares rose after U.S. data on jobless claims and
manufacturing beat estimates, easing concern Europe’s debt
crisis will drag the global economy into a recession.  American depositary receipts of  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , which gets
44 percent of its sales in  North America , rose 0.3 percent from
the closing price in Tokyo. Those of  Advantest Corp. (6857) , a maker of
memory-chip testers, rose 0.7 percent.  James Hardie Industries
SE (JHX) , a supplier of building materials that gets 68 percent of
sales from the U.S., rose 1.7 percent.  Futures (TPX)  on the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in March
closed at 8,405 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 8,370 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,400 in Osaka,
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.2
percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index was little changed.  “The U.S. economy is ending the year in a bit better shape
than people had anticipated, and that is good, but Europe is
obviously not,” said Stephen Halmarick, Sydney-based head of
investment markets research at Colonial First State Global Asset
Management, which oversees about $150 billion. “The European
economy is heading toward recession next year, and I think it’s
going to continue to weigh on markets.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  gained 0.1
percent today. The index rose 0.3 percent in New York yesterday
after U.S. initial jobless claims  fell by 19,000 to 366,000  last
week, the fewest since May 2008. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was 390,000.  ‘Escalating’ Crisis  Separately, two reports showed manufacturing in the New
York and Philadelphia regions expanded more than forecast in
December. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s  general
economic index  accelerated to the highest level in seven months,
to 9.5 from 0.6 in November. The Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia’s general economic index increased to 10.3 in
December from 3.6 last month.  Gains in stocks may be limited today after International
Monetary Fund Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said yesterday
that  Europe ’s crisis is “escalating” and cannot be resolved by
one group of countries.  Chinese stocks trading in the U.S. fell to a two-month low,
led by declines for Baidu Inc. and Cnooc Ltd., on mounting
concern that the slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy
may worsen. The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks lost 1.3 percent to 93.46, the lowest closing
level since Oct. 7.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 19 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 3.3 percent drop by the S&P
500 and a 15 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.5 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.3 times for the S&P 500
and 10.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
