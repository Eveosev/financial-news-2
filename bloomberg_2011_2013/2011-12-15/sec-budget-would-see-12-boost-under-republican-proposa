The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission would receive a 12 percent budget increase for fiscal
year 2012 in a bill proposed by House Republicans.  The Republican proposal released late yesterday calls for
raising SEC spending by $136 million over 2011 levels, a change
from earlier proposals that would have held the agency’s budget
constant despite new responsibilities under the Dodd-Frank
financial-regulation law.  House and Senate leaders must finish negotiations on the $1
trillion catchall bill before current federal funding expires
tomorrow. SEC Chairman  Mary Schapiro  has asked Congress to
approve a $1.4 billion budget for 2012; this Republican proposal
would put set the budget at $1.3 billion.  “The proposal we submitted was what we thought we needed
to do the job,” Schapiro told reporters today at SEC offices in
 Washington . “That said, it’s obviously very positive to us to
have an increase, and we’re really grateful for that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
