The European Union mission in  Kosovo 
dismissed charges of corruption and abuse of office against
former central bank Governor Hashim Rexhepi, who was arrested in
July last year.  “Even though the former governor undertook some
inappropriate action, his conduct was not linked to the exertion
of any official power or authority,” the  EU Rule of Law Mission 
in the capital Pristina said in an e-mailed statement today.
Rexhepi was arrested in July 2010 and released from prison on
bail in November.  Rexhepi was appointed to a five-year term in March 2008 and
was replaced by his deputy Gani Gerguri after the arrest.  Kosovo, where 90 percent of the population is ethnic
Albanian, wants to strengthen the rule of law more than three
years after declaring independence from  Serbia . The Balkan
country led by Prime Minister Hashim Thaci wants to exert
authority in the Serb-dominated north as it seeks to mend ties
with its former ruler.  To contact the reporter on this story:
