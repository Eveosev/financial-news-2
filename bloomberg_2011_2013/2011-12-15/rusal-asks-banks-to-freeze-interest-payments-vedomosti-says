United Co. Rusal , the world’s
biggest aluminum maker, hasn’t asked banks to allow it to skip
interest payments on loans next year, the company’s press
service said by e-mail, denying a report today in Vedomosti.  Rusal has requested lenders temporarily waive covenants on
a $4.75 billion pre-export finance loan it signed Sept. 29, a
person with direct knowledge of the deal said on Dec. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
