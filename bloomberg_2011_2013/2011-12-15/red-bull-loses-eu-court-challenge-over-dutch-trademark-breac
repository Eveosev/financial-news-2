Red Bull  GmbH, an Austrian energy-
drink maker, lost a challenge at the European Union’s highest
court over an alleged breach of its trademark by a Dutch
company.  “A service consisting of the mere filling of cans bearing
a sign protected as a trademark is not use of that sign which is
liable to be prohibited,” the  EU Court of Justice , the region’s
top court, said in a ruling in Luxembourg today.  Red Bull, based in Fuschl am See,  Austria , sued Dutch
company Frisdranken Industrie Winters B.V. after it filled up
cans bearing logos and texts such as “Bullfigter,” and “Red
Horn” with drinks for another company, called Smart Drinks. Red
Bull, whose logo is a red bull, argued its Benelux trademark
rights had been infringed.  Frisdranken didn’t use the protected trademark and couldn’t
have infringed it, the court said.  “The service provided by Winters consists of the filling
of cans and this service does not have any similarity with the
product for which Red Bull’s trademarks were registered,” said
the EU court.  Tina Deutner, a spokeswoman for Red Bull, declined to
comment.  The case is pending at the Dutch Supreme Court, which last
year sought the EU court’s guidance whether a company that fills
up cans provided by another company, can breach trademark
rights.  The case is: C-119/10, Frisdranken Industrie Winters BV v.
Red Bull GmbH.  To contact the reporter on this story:
