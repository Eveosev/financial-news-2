The lira strengthened for the first
day in four and headed for the biggest gain in two weeks against
the dollar after the central bank sold $150 million, the highest
since Oct. 24.  The lira rose 0.6 percent to 1.8767 at 5:09 p.m. in
Istanbul, paring this week’s decline to 1.9 percent.  Yields  on
the two-year benchmark debt fell nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 10.29 percent, a Royal Bank of Scotland
index of the securities showed.  Turkey ’s central bank sold $150 million today after
offering to sell as much as $250 million. The Ankara-based bank
received $631 million in bids compared with $83 million
yesterday when it sold $50 million. It has sold almost $9.6
billion since August in daily dollar auctions and via direct
action in the market to bolster the lira and contain the rise in
inflation.  Central Bank Governor Erdem Basci and policy makers have
“already signaled that they are uncomfortable and they will
increase foreign exchange auction sales” at a meeting with
analysts in  London  this week, Thu Lan Nguyen, a currency
strategist at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said in e-mailed
comments.  Double-Digit Inflation  Turkey’s unemployment rate fell to 8.8 percent in
September, the lowest since the data series began in January
2005, from 11.3 percent a year earlier, the statistics office
said today. Its  budget surplus  in November was 2.1 billion liras
($1.1 billion), the  Finance Ministry  said on its website today.
The surplus followed a deficit of 365 million liras a year
earlier.  “The economy is still dynamic and the market is pricing in
double-digit inflation expectations for the first three months
of next year,” Murat Yardimci, chief trader at ING Bank AS in
Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments.  Inflation in 12 months is expected to fall to 7.15 percent,
compared with an estimate of 6.99 percent two weeks ago, a
fortnightly central bank survey of economists and business
leaders showed Dec. 7. The  inflation  rate rose to 9.5 percent in
November from 7.7 percent a month earlier, the statistics office
announced Dec. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
