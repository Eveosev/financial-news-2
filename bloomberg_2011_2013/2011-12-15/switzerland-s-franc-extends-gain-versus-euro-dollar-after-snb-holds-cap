The Swiss franc extended gains
versus the euro and dollar after the central bank maintained the
currency’s exchange-rate ceiling.  The franc was 0.8 percent stronger at 1.2284 per euro at
8:32 a.m. London time and appreciated 1.2 percent against the
dollar.  The  Swiss National Bank , led by Philipp Hildebrand, kept
the franc’s minimum exchange rate at 1.20 per euro today. That’s
in line with the forecasts of nine out of 13 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The Zurich-based central bank also
maintained its benchmark  interest rate  at zero.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
