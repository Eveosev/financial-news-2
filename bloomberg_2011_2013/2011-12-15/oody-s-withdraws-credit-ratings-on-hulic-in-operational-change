Moody’s  Japan  K.K. withdrew its
credit ratings on  Hulic Co. (3265) , according to an e-mailed statement
today by the ratings company, which said the move “does not
reflect a change” in the real estate company’s
creditworthiness.  Moody’s move comes as the company realigns its operations
in the world’s third-biggest economy. Hulic, a real estate
company that has 12 billion yen ($154 million) of bonds maturing
in 2015, was rated A3, or Moody’s fourth-lowest investment
grade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We have limited resources in Japan,” Tatsuya Inada,
Tokyo-based spokesman at the risk assessor, said in a telephone
interview today. “To respond to the rising demand for
information on credit risks, we started withdrawing ratings on
some companies.”  Moody’s is shifting its operations “to focus on providing
ratings and research on Japanese cross-border and globally
significant issuers,” it said in a separate e-mailed statement
on Dec. 13. The risk assessor is considering removing ratings on
about 20 borrowers in Japan, Inada said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
