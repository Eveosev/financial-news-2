Paresh Nayar, Mumbai-based head of
money-market and currency trading at FirstRand Ltd., comments on
the outlook for  India ’s rupee after the central bank tightened
rules for currency forwards, seeking to temper speculation.  Forward contracts once canceled cannot be bought again, the
 Reserve Bank  of India said in a statement on its website today,
after the rupee fell to a record low of 54.305 per dollar.  “This is a good step to curtail the rupee’s weakness. The
move will curb building of speculation in the market. This is
possible as the rupee is not fully convertible. The central bank
has lot of controls and that’s one advantage.  ‘‘The rupee may gain past 53 per dollar in initial trades
tomorrow and there is a possibility the currency will move
toward 52 during the day.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
