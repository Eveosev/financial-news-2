(Corrects fourth paragraph to indicate international
comparisons are ratio to  household income  and not in euros in
story that ran Dec. 14.)  Italians remain among the richest
and least-indebted people in the world, even as net household
wealth declined last year, according to the  Bank of Italy .  Total household net wealth fell 1.5 percent in 2010 from
the previous year to 8.6 trillion euros ($11.2 trillion) when
adjusted for inflation, and was down 3.2 percent from its peak
at the end of 2007, the central bank said in a report released
in  Rome  today. Net wealth probably rose 0.4 percent in nominal
terms in the first half of 2011, according to the report.  Gross household wealth at the end of 2010 amounted to 9.53
trillion euros, or almost 400,000 euros per family, with real-
estate accounting for almost two-thirds, the Bank of  Italy  said.  Italians’ net wealth in 2009 was 8.3 times gross household
disposable income, more than the 8 times for the U.K., 7.5 times
for France, 7 times in Japan, 5.5 times in Canada and 4.9 times
in the U.S. Figures for Germany weren’t given.  Italy, the euro region’s second most-indebted country after
 Greece , is struggling to tame borrowing costs that have surged
to record highs amid  Europe ’s sovereign crisis. Prime Minister
Mario Monti’s Cabinet approved a sweeping budget plan on Dec. 4
aimed at raising revenue and spurring economic growth in a bid
to persuade investors Italy can avoid following Greece, Ireland
and Portugal in seeking a bailout.  Five percent of financial assets held by Italian families
were directly invested in Italian government debt at the end of
2010, down from 5.8 percent the previous year, the report
showed. Household debt in Italy amounted to about 82 percent of
disposable income in 2009, compared with about 100 percent in
 France  and Germany, 130 percent in the U.S. and Japan and 170
percent in the U.K., the Bank of Italy said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
