SAP AG (SAP)  doesn’t plan any major
acquisitions after the takeover of SuccessFactors Inc., which
was the company’s “big purchase,”  Financial Times Deutschland 
reported in a preview of an article that will be published
tomorrow, citing  Bill McDermott , SAP’s co-chief executive
officer.  There aren’t any “good firms” to buy at the moment, many
are “older, tired and don’t grow fast anymore,” the newspaper
reported McDermott as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
