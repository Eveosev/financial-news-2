Ontario’s rating outlook was cut to
negative from stable by Moody’s Investors Service on concern
 Canada ’s most populous province faces a higher risk in meeting
fiscal targets given a recent slowdown in economic growth.  The province’s C$190 billion ($183.6 billion) of debt
maintains its Aa1 rating, Moody’s said in a statement today.  The province in November revised its forecasts down for
provincial growth in 2011 and 2012 to 1.8 percent and 1.8
percent, from 2.4 percent and 2.7 percent, Moody’s said. The
provincial economy is affected by the moderation in U.S. growth,
given its higher export share relative to other Canadian
provinces and the estimated 80 percent of international exports
destined for the nation’s largest trading partner.  “The negative outlook on the province reflects the
softening economic outlook, Ontario’s growing debt burden, and
the extended timeframe to achieving a balanced budget,” Moody’s
Assistant Vice President Jennifer Wong, lead analyst for the
Province of Ontario, said in the statement.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
