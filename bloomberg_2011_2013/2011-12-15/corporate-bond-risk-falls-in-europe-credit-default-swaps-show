The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate debt fell, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 28
basis points to 787.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 2:30
p.m. in London. A decline signals improvement in perceptions of
 credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 6.25 basis points to 185.25 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers decreased 19 basis points to 314 and
the subordinated index dropped 22 to 561.5.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments declined seven basis points to 376 basis points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13 million) of debt from default for five years
is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face
value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
