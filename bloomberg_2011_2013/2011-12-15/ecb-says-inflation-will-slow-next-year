The  European Central Bank  said
inflation pressures in the euro area should slow next year as
the sovereign debt crisis damps growth.  “The intensified financial market tensions are continuing
to dampen economic activity in the euro area and the outlook
remains subject to high uncertainty and substantial downside
risks,” the Frankfurt-based ECB said in its monthly bulletin
today, echoing President  Mario Draghi ’s Dec. 8 policy statement.
“In such an environment, cost, wage and price pressures in the
euro area should remain modest over the policy-relevant horizon.
Inflation is likely to stay above 2 percent for several months
to come, before declining to below 2 percent.”  The ECB last week cut its  benchmark interest rate  for a
second consecutive month, taking it to 1 percent. The central
bank also slashed its 2012 growth forecast to 0.3 percent from
1.3 percent and predicted inflation will slow to an average of 2
percent next year and 1.5 percent in 2013 from 3 percent today.  “Downside risks notably relate to a further
intensification of the tensions in euro-area financial markets
and their potential spillover to the euro-area real economy,”
the ECB said, adding that the global economy “may be weaker
than expected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
