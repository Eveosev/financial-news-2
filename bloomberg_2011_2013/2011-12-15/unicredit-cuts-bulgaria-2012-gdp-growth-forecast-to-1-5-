UniCredit SpA ,  Italy ’s biggest bank,
cut  Bulgaria ’s growth forecast for this and next year on concern
the euro area crisis will cut investment and demand for the
country’s exports in the European Union.  Bulgaria’s  gross domestic product  will probably expand 1.5
percent in 2012, down from a previous forecast of 2.6 percent,
UniCredit said in an e-mailed statement today. The economy will
expand 2 percent this year, compared with a March 31 estimate of
2.6 percent, the bank said.  “The challenges facing Bulgaria’s economic recovery
include contraction of external demand combined with a gradual
decrease of corporate-sector debt and a slow recovery in the
real estate and labor markets,” UniCredit said. A drop in
Bulgaria’s third-quarter foreign investments to 159 million
euros ($197 million) is another reason for the forecast growth
cut, the bank said.  Bulgaria ships 60 percent of its  exports  to the EU. The
bloc’s poorest country in terms of economic output per capita
withstood the global recession in 2009 without an international
bailout. Its economic growth slowed to 1.6 percent from a year
earlier in the third quarter, the weakest in five quarters.  “Bulgaria will avoid a second recession because the
public-sector balance and the household sector remain strong,”
UniCredit said.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its GDP forecasts for
Bulgaria on Dec. 9 to 1.9 percent this year and 1.3 percent in
2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
