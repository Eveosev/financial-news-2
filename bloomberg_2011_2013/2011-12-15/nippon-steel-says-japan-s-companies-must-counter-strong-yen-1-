Japanese companies must “seriously
consider” taking measures to compete globally as a stronger yen
cuts into sales,  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401)  Chairman Akio Mimura said.  Domestic industries need to cut costs by investing overseas
or combining operations to counter the currency, Mimura told
reporters in  Tokyo  today, a day after  Japan ’s biggest steelmaker
received regulatory approval for its merger with  Sumitomo Metal
Industries Ltd. (5405)  Managements should be prepared for the yen to
remain strong, he said.  The yen rose to a postwar high of 75.35 a dollar on Oct.
31, prompting Japan to intervene for the third time this year to
stem gains that endangered an export-led economic recovery after
the March earthquake. The merger of Nippon Steel and Sumitomo
Metal, aimed at countering Asian and European rivals, dovetails
with the government’s efforts to encourage takeovers to boost
growth in the world’s third-largest economy.  Nippon Steel’s 685 billion yen ($8.8 billion) all-share
purchase of  Sumitomo Metal  by October next year will create the
world’s second-largest steelmaker. The partners plan to cut
excess capacity and reduce executive headcount, Mimura said.
They aren’t considering closing any factories, he said.  The merger was approved “faster than usual,” Masanori
Fukamachi, senior officer for mergers and acquisitions at the
Fair Trade Commission, said yesterday.  “I hope the regulator’s conclusion on the merger case will
prompt those who were previously hesitant to move toward such
directions,” Mimura said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
