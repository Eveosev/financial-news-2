European stock futures fell,
indicating the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index will extend
losses from a two-week low, as economic growth from China to
Japan and  South Korea  slowed.  Telefonica SA (TEF)  may decline after cutting its dividend
forecast for the first time in a decade. Credit Agricole SA may
slide after predicting a loss in 2011 and announcing job cuts.
 Zodiac Aerospace (ZC)  SA may move as Europe’s biggest maker of
aircraft seats said sales in the first-quarter rose 21 percent.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index expiring in December
lost 0.4 percent to 2,203 at 7:01 a.m. in  London . FTSE 100 Index
futures declined 0.3 percent. The March contract on the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index retreated 0.3 percent. The MSCI Asia-Pacific
Index retreated 1.9 percent.  “The balance of risk has shifted to the downside again,”
said Valentijn Van Nieuwenhuijzen, the head of strategy at ING
Investment Management in  The Hague , which has $163 billion in
assets under management. “Overall our stance is quite
defensive. It’s still uncertain what the end game is going to
look like” for the euro area, he told Linzie Janis in a
Bloomberg Television interview.  The Stoxx Europe 600 fell to its lowest level since Nov. 29
yesterday as the U.S. Federal Reserve refrained from taking new
action to bolster the world’s largest economy. The gauge has
retreated 16 percent this year as the euro-area debt crisis
spread to the region’s larger economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
