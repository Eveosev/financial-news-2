Cyprus’s parliament passed a scaled-
back fiscal consolidation package yesterday in a session
disrupted by  strike action  by the civil servants’ union  PASYDY .  The fiscal impact of the package was reduced to 855 million
euros ($1.1 billion) over three years following a deal ahead of
the vote, the chairman of the parliamentary finance committee,
Nicholas Papadopoulos said in an interview yesterday.  The package included a two-year wage freeze in the public
sector and cuts in social spending. It also included an increase
in the defense levy imposed on companies managed and controlled
in Cyprus, a tax on private sector workers whose income exceeds
2,500 euros a month and an increase in the value added  tax rate 
to 17 percent from March 1.  The strike will continue today when the parliament meets to
vote on the 2012 budget, PASYDY said in a statement on its
website. The union asked its 15,000 members to disrupt Sunday’s
municipal elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
