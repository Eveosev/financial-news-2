Statoil ASA (STL) , Norway’s largest oil
and natural-gas company, drilled a dry hole in deep waters off
the coast of northeastern Brazil.  Statoil is evaluating the next steps at the project after
failing to find oil in a well in 1,890 meters (6,200 feet) of
water at the Camamu-Almada basin, Statoil said today in an e-
mailed response to questions.  “It is disappointing with a negative well result but that
is the risk with frontier exploration,” Statoil said. “We will
now evaluate the result before we decide on next steps.”  Statoil, based in Stavanger, Norway, started drilling the
well in October.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s state-
controlled producer, is a partner with Statoil at the project.  Gran Tierra Energy Inc. (GTE) , a Canadian oil company operating
in South America, agreed to buy a 15 percent stake in the BM-
CAL-10 block on Sept. 15 as it expands in Brazil, which plans to
double oil production over the next 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
