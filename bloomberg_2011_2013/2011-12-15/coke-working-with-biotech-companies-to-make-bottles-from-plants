The Coca-Cola Co. (KO) , the world’s
largest soft-drink maker, is working with three biotechnology
companies to commercialize plastic bottles made entirely from
plants.  Virent Inc.,  Gevo Inc.  and Avantium all received
“multimillion-dollar” contracts to develop plant-based
plastics, Atlanta-based Coca-Cola said today in a statement.  Coca-Cola, which provides 1.7 billion servings of its
beverages every day, has distributed since 2009 more than 10
billion of its PlantBottles, made with as much as 30 percent
plant materials. Developing new packaging made from renewable
sources will help the company further reduce its use of plastics
made from fossil fuels.  “While the technology to make bio-based materials in a lab
has been available for years, we believe Virent, Gevo and
Avantium are companies that possess technologies that have high
potential for creating them on a global commercial scale within
the next few years, Rick Frazier, Coca-Cola’s vice president for
commercial product supply, said in the statement.  The plant-based plastics under development will be
indistinguishable from their petroleum-derived counterparts,
Gevo Chief Executive Officer Patrick Gruber said in an interview
today. Potential demand from Coca-Cola is so large that a single
company couldn’t meet the beverage company’s needs.  ‘‘This market is so darn big, you’ve got to have many
suppliers,” he said.  Plant-based plastic “will be cost-competitive in the long-
run,” Gruber said. “The goal is to make it commercial and
competitive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
