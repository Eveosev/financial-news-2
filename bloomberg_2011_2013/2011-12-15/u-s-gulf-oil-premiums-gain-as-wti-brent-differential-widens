U.S. Gulf oil premiums gained as the
difference between West Texas Intermediate and Brent widened for
the second consecutive day.  The spread between the two benchmark crude futures for
January delivery increased $1.25 to $11.32 a barrel at 12:20
p.m. in  New York . The spread has narrowed 59 percent since
reaching a record of $27.88 a barrel Oct. 14.  When Brent increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet ’s premium to WTI added 35 cents to
$11.45 a barrel at 11:55 a.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s  premium narrowed
20 cents to $11.30 a barrel.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI increased 25 cents to $9.70.
The premium for Mars Blend added 5 cents to $7.20 a barrel.
 Poseidon  was unchanged at $6.75 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon ’s premium increased 15 cents to $6.75
a barrel and  West Texas Sour ’s discount was unchanged at 85
cents.  The discount for  Western Canada Select  was unchanged at
$16.25 a barrel.  Syncrude ’s premium was unchanged at $2.40 a barrel.
