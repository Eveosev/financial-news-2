     Dec. 15 (Bloomberg) -- Canaccord Financial Inc. is close to
buying  Collins Stewart  Hawkpoint Plc, a brokerage in the U.K.,
the Globe and Mail reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Canaccord, Canada’s largest non-bank brokerage, has been
looking for a purchase in the U.K. for “months,” the  newspaper 
said.  Collins Stewart rose 6.9 percent to 54 pence in London
trading today. Toronto-based Canaccord was halted on the Toronto
Stock Exchange before trading opened.  To contact the reporter on this story:
