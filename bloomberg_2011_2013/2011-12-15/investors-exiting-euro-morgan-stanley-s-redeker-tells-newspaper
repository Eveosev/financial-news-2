Investors have begun to flee the
euro in preference for the U.S. dollar amid fears that the
European debt crisis may worsen,  Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s Global Head of
Foreign Exchange  Hans Redeker  said in an interview in the
 Handelsblatt .  That’s helping weaken the euro against the dollar, Redeker
was cited as saying by the newspaper. The single currency will
probably be worth $1.20 by the fourth quarter of 2012, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
