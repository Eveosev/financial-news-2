The  European Central Bank  said it is
concerned about the independence of  Hungary ’s central bank,
Magyar Nemzeti Bank, after the government proposed changes to
the way senior staff are appointed.  “Constant changes in the composition of the MNB’s
decision-making bodies, the increase in the number of Monetary
Council members, together with the possibility of increasing the
number of deputy governors gives rise to concerns whether this
could be used to influence the decision-making process to the
detriment of central bank independence,” the ECB said in a
legal opinion on the Hungarian government’s draft legislation.  The draft bill, posted on the parliament’s website
yesterday, would expand the central bank’s rate-setting Monetary
Council to as many as nine members from seven and force the
bank’s governor to cede powers, including naming vice
presidents, to the prime minister and the country’s president.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  has been curbing the power of
independent institutions and asserting his influence since
winning a two-thirds parliamentary majority last year. Central
bank President Andras Simor in March said he rejected what he
called “bullying” by a government official to quit before his
mandate expires in 2013.  In the legal opinion, the ECB also said it is concerned
that amendments to the draft law have been made without the
Frankfurt-based central bank being informed.  “In such situations, the ECB expects the consulting
authority to submit the amended draft legislative provision to
it as soon as possible, so that the opinion can be based on the
most recent text,” it said. “The ECB would appreciate the
Ministry for the National Economy giving due consideration to
honoring its obligation to consult the ECB in the future.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
