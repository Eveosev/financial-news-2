Billionaire Roustam Tariko’s Russian
Standard vodka brand said it bought 70 percent of sparkling-wine
and vermouth producer Flli Gancia & C. SpA in an effort to
expand the Italian company.  Tariko will lead Gancia as its president, while members of
the Vallarino Gancia family “will continue to play an important
role in the company,” St. Petersburg-based Russian Standard
said today in a statement.  Russian Standard’s resources will make it possible to
develop Canelli Asti-based Gancia into  Russia ’s and the world’s
leading brand, Tariko said in the statement.  Gancia, which was founded in 1850, operates 2,000 hectares
(4,942 acres) of vineyards in the Asti province and produces a
crop of 5 million kilograms (11 million pounds) of grapes a
year, Russian Standard said. The vintner produces more than 25
million bottles of wine and aperitif wine a year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
