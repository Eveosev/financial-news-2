The  Cleveland Cavaliers  waived guard
Baron Davis under the amnesty clause of the  National Basketball
Association ’s new collective bargaining agreement.  Davis, 32, may miss eight to 10 weeks with a herniated disc
in his back, the  New York Post reported , citing Davis’s agent,
Todd Ramasar. The  New York Knicks  are among the clubs interested
in signing Davis if he clears amnesty waivers, the Post said,
citing unidentified people.  Davis “has been an absolute professional since the day he
joined the Cavs and we now wish him the best in the future,”
Cleveland General Manager Chris Grant said in a statement.  A two-time All-Star, Davis averaged 13.1 points and 6.7
assists last season, playing in 58 games. About $27 million of
the $30 million left on Davis’s contract is guaranteed over the
next two years, according to ESPN.com.  The 2011-12 NBA season was shortened to 66 games from 82
after a lockout, meaning Davis likely will miss at least half
the campaign if his back injury takes more than two months to
heal.  The agreement ending the five-month work stoppage allows
each team to cut one player to pare salary without affecting
payroll ceilings or luxury tax liability. Davis can be taken by
any club that is under the salary cap, with the team making the
highest bid getting his rights. If he clears waivers, he’ll be
an unrestricted free agent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
