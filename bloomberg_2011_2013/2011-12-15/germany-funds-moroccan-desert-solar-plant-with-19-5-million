Germany  will spend 15 million euros
($19.5 million) to help finance a solar-power plant in southern
Morocco near the Sahara desert.  German state-owned lender KfW Group signed a contract with
the  Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy  to provide equity for a
160-megawatt solar-thermal project near Ouarzazate, the German
Environment Ministry said today in an e-mailed statement.  Construction for the facility, which would be able to store
solar power for up to three hours, is scheduled to start next
year and last about 12 months, it said.  Germany’s contribution was made “in close cooperation”
with other donors including the  World Bank  and the  European
Investment Bank  as Morocco aims to build 2,000 megawatts of
solar power by the end of this decade, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
