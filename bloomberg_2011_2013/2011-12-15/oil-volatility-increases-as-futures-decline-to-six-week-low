Oil options volatility dropped as
the underlying futures tumbled to a six-week low after  Fitch
Ratings  lowered  France ’s rating outlook and put nations
including Spain and  Italy  on review for a downgrade.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
February, a measure of expected swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, fell to 36.8 at 2 p.m. in New York from 38
yesterday. Oil dropped as much as 1.4 percent as Fitch cited
 Europe ’s failure to find a “comprehensive solution” to the
debt crisis as a reason for the review.  The most active options contracts in electronic trading
today were February $110 calls, with 1,920 lots changing hands
as of 1:57 p.m. in New York. The options fell 14 cents to 44
cents a barrel. February $90 puts traded 1,396 lots, dropping 3
cents to $2.58. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Oil for January delivery dropped 30 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to $93.57 a barrel at 1:54 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract touched $92.52, the lowest intraday level
since Nov. 3.  February $140 calls were the most active options traded in
the previous session, with 3,952 lots changing hands. They rose
1 cent to 12 cents a barrel. The next most active options,
