Israel ’s inflation expectations
increased for a third time this week ahead of a report forecast
to show consumer prices increased in November.  The  two-year breakeven rate , the difference between
inflation-linked bonds and similar-maturity fixed-rate
government debt, gained two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point to 212, implying an average annual inflation rate of 2.12
percent at 11:34 a.m. in Tel Aviv. The yield on the CPI-linked
notes due June 2013 dropped for a third day, declining one basis
point to 0.53 percent.  The statistic bureau will probably report today that annual
inflation accelerated to 2.8 percent in November from 2.7
percent in October, according to the median estimate of 11
economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg. The central bank is mandated
to keep inflation inside a target of 1 percent to 3 percent.
Governor  Stanley Fischer  cut the benchmark  interest rate  to 2.75
percent for the second time in three months on Nov. 28 as the
European debt crisis weighed on the country’s economy.  “We recommend investors to have a portfolio of 50:50 of
CPI-linked and non-linked government bonds with a duration of an
average of five years,” said Ori Greenfeld, head of the
macroeconomic  research department , at Psagot Investment House
Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “Inflation in November accelerated as
electricity prices rose by about 5 percent and due to seasonal
increases in vegetable prices.”  Consumer Prices  Consumer prices probably increased 0.2 percent last month
from 0.1 percent in October, according to the median forecast of
12 economists in a  survey .  Electricity prices may increase between 10 percent and 20
percent in 2012 following disruptions in gas supply from  Egypt 
to Israel this year, Greenfeld said. Natural-gas flow from Egypt
was halted after an explosion on the Sinai pipeline network on
Nov. 28 that delivers the fuel.  The yield on the 5.5 percent notes due January 2022 dropped
three basis points to 4.67 percent. The shekel was little
changed at 3.8116 a dollar. The currency weakened 3.6 percent in
November.  Two-year  interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, fell two basis points to
2.59 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
