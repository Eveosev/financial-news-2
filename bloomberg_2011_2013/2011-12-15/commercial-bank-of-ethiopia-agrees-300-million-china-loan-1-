The Commercial Bank of  Ethiopia 
signed a memorandum of understanding with the Export-Import Bank
of  China  for a $300 million credit facility, Ethiopia’s state-
owned lender said.  “The amount is to be used by the CBE whenever it needs it
in the future,” Chief Business Development Officer Yishak
Mengesha said in an e-mailed response to questions yesterday.  The terms of the loan and interest rate will be negotiated
later, he said. The money will help fund projects as part of the
country’s five-year growth plan, according to Ethiopia’s Addis
Ababa-based Foreign Ministry.  The Horn of Africa nation plans to invest about $33 billion
in industry and infrastructure by mid-2015. Projects include 10
sugar factories and a $4.8 billion hydropower plant on the Blue
Nile river. The loan takes EXIM Bank’s lending to Ethiopia to
more than $1.8 billion, according to the Foreign Ministry.  The Chinese bank also plans to lend the government 1.7
billion birr ($98 million) for water-supply projects for the
capital,  Addis Ababa , the ministry said in an e-mailed statement
on Dec. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
