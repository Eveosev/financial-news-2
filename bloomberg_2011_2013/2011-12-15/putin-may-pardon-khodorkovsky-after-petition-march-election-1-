Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir
Putin  said he may pardon  Mikhail Khodorkovsky  following March
presidential elections if the former Yukos Oil Co. chief
petitions for early release.  “I’ll consider a petition if he writes this request, but
first it’s necessary to become president,” Putin told reporters
in Moscow today. “The law is such that a person serving a
prison sentence and convicted by a court verdict must write a
petition for pardon and admit his guilt, something Khodorkovsky
hasn’t yet done.”  The jailed billionaire was Russia’s richest man when he was
arrested at gunpoint on the tarmac of a Siberian airport in
October 2003. Khodorkovsky, who denies any guilt, says he was
targeted by then-President Putin for financing opposition
parties.  Khodorkovsky was later sentenced to 13 years in prison
after two separate convictions for fraud,  tax evasion  and oil
embezzlement, while Yukos was dismantled and sold at auction to
cover more than $30 billion in back taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
