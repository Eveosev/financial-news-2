Morgan Stanley (MS)  Capital Services LLC
withdrew from lawsuits in New York state court challenging  MBIA
Inc.’s (MBI)  2009 restructuring after reaching a settlement with the
bond insurer.  Today’s move followed Morgan Stanley’s settling litigation
with MBIA on Dec. 13 over credit-default swaps that led to
billions of dollars of losses. The bank agreed to terminate the
swap contracts and drop its challenge to the insurer’s
restructuring.  HSBC Bank USA NA agreed on Dec. 14 to withdraw from two
lawsuits in New York State Supreme Court in  Manhattan  opposing
the MBIA restructuring, becoming the fifth plaintiff to drop out
of the litigation since August.  Banks including UBS AG and Bank of America Corp. remain
plaintiffs in the suits, according to court filings. The banks
claimed in their suits that the restructuring of Armonk, New
York-based MBIA might leave the insurer unable to pay claims.  More banks or other companies disputing MBIA’s
restructuring may drop their lawsuits by the end of the year,
Jay Brown, the bond insurer’s chief executive officer, said last
month. Banks have discontinued litigation as MBIA negotiates
settlements over the credit-default swaps it sold to the lenders
to protect against losses on mortgage securities and other debt.  The cases are ABN Amro Bank NV v. MBIA Inc., 601475/2009,
and ABN Amro Bank NV v. Dinallo, 601846/2009,  New York  State
Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
