Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. , operator
of the namesake coffee shops, opened its 10,000th global  Dunkin’
Donuts  location today as it accelerates growth in  China .  There is a “huge opportunity” in the Asian nation, Chief
Executive Officer Nigel Travis said in an interview today after
announcing the opening of the cafe in Xi’an.  Dunkin’ Donuts, which has about 7,000 U.S. shops, will
boost its overseas store count to 10,000 from about 3,000, he
said, while declining to specify a time period. Dunkin’ has more
than 80 stores in China, compared with about 500  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) 
cafes.  “We will grow faster internationally than domestically,”
Travis said.  Dunkin’ Brands, which  raised  $486 million in an initial
public offering in July after its underwriters exercised an
option to buy more shares, has sought to increase global store
openings to compete with Starbucks and  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  Canton,
Massachusetts-based Dunkin’ said earlier this year it will open
more than 500 locations in  India  during the next 15 years.  In China, Dunkin’ is introducing savory bagels with
toppings such as spinach, roasted red peppers and garlic
mayonnaise to sell during the after-lunch period, Travis said.
In Asian nations, “breakfast isn’t the biggest focus for us,
it’s the afternoon snacking,” he said.  Travis  said  in November that the company will open as many
as 240 Dunkin’ shops this year in the U.S. and plans to more
than double its U.S. store count to 15,000 in the next 20 years.
McDonald’s has about 14,000 U.S. locations.  Dunkin’, which sells single-serve capsules that fit in
 Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR) ’s Keurig machines, is
“completely on track” with K-Cup sales and will be introducing
new flavors for the pods, he said.  There are more than 16,500 Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-
Robbins restaurants in 56 countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
