Athenahealth Inc. (ATHN) , which sells
electronic health records to doctors, declined the most since
April 2010 after its 2012 earnings projection missed analysts’
estimates.  Athenahealth forecast adjusted earnings of 85 cents to 97
cents at an investor meeting in Watertown,  Massachusetts , where
the company is based. The average estimate of 22 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was $1.13. The shares fell 15 percent to
$49.04 at 4 p.m. New York time.  “It’s a classic case of something running pretty hot into
the analyst day and people being disappointed,” said
Constantine Davides, an analyst with JMP Securities LLC.  Athenahealth makes electronic health records that
physicians use to manage their practices and track patients.
Revenue has increased at least 30 percent a year since 2006. The
company will have to invest next year to continue to grow, which
will push down margins, said Chief Financial Officer  Tim Adams .  “Our fiscal year 2012 expectations are consistent with our
long-standing goals to grow revenue by at least 30% annually and
to invest wisely in growth and innovation,” Adams said today in
a statement ahead of a company investor conference.  The drop in today’s share price may not be warranted when
results come in over the next year, Davides said.  “Folks need to keep in mind that this is a conservative
management team,” Davides said in a telephone interview. Adams
may be setting low “expectations in the event that business
conditions change, or they want to make investments they may not
have seen at the beginning of the year,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
