Taiwan’s dollar fell the most in
three weeks on concern Europe’s debt crisis will hurt Asian
exports, sapping demand for emerging-market assets. Bonds rose.  The  MSCI Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  of regional shares lost 1.7
percent after Japan’s Tankan index of large manufacturers’
sentiment fell more than economists forecast and sales at major
South Korean department stores declined for the first time since
February 2009.  Fitch Ratings  downgraded five European lenders
yesterday, including Credit Agricole SA, France’s second-biggest
bank by assets.  “We’re seeing weaker Asian currencies as global  market
sentiment  is in risk-off mode,” said Teck Kin Suan, an
economist at United Overseas Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “Export-
driven currencies such as the Korean won and the  Taiwan dollar 
will continue to weaken into the first quarter of next year.”  The Taiwan dollar fell 0.3 percent to NT$30.37 against its
U.S. counterpart in Taipei, the weakest level since Nov. 30 and
the biggest loss since Nov. 23, according to Taipei Forex Inc.
The island’s benchmark  Taiex (TWSE)  stock index dropped 2.3 percent.  Government bonds rose. The yield on the 1.25 percent bonds
due September 2021 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 1.245 percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market
show.  Taiwan’s legislature approved a plan to issue up to NT$610
billion ($20.1 billion) of government bonds with maturities of
more than a year, Tang Ming-hui, deputy director-general at the
Ministry of Finance’s National Treasury Agency, said yesterday.  “Bond issues next year can’t exceed the budgeted amount
approved but we haven’t decided on the exact 2012 bond plan,”
Tang said.  The government has sold NT$585 billion of bonds so far this
year, compared with a 2011 plan to sell NT$620 billion, he said.
It is scheduled to auction NT$35 billion of 10-year bonds on
Dec. 26, the  finance ministry  said earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
