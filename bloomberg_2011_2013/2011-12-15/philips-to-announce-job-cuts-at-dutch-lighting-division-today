Royal Philips Electronics NV (PHIA) , the
world’s biggest maker of  light bulbs , said it will outline a
first round of job cuts in the Netherlands at its lighting unit
today as part of a global spending-reduction drive.  “We will make some announcements in Eindhoven regarding
the restructuring measures,” Eric Drent, a Philips spokesman in
the Dutch city, said by phone. As many as 170 positions could be
eliminated, said Ron van Baden, an official at the FNV
Bondgenoten labor union.  The measures are part of a bigger overhaul that Amsterdam-
based Philips announced in October involving 4,500 jobs
worldwide in a 800 million-euro ($1.04 billion) savings drive.
Chief Executive Officer Frans  van Houten  is working to improve
efficiency as Philips battles slowing market growth in lighting
and consumer-electronics and increasing competition from lower-
cost manufacturers in Asia.  About 1,400 jobs are likely to be cut in the Netherlands,
Van Houten said at the time.  The CEO, who took the helm in April, is also the acting
head of the lighting unit after division chief Rudy Provoost
left to become CEO of  Rexel SA. (RXL)   To contact the reporter on this story:
