Malaysia ’s ringgit slumped for a
sixth day, its longest losing streak in three months, as concern
Europe’s debt crisis will slow global economic growth damped
demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency reached a 10-week low before data tomorrow
that economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict will show
Singapore’s exports contracted for a third month in November.
The city-state is Malaysia’s second-largest export market. The
 MSCI Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks fell for a third day after
 Fitch Ratings  downgraded five European lenders yesterday,
including Credit Agricole SA, France’s second-biggest bank by
assets.  “People are in a risk-off mode because of the uncertainty
over the European crisis,” said Zulkiflee Nidzam, head of
foreign-exchange trading at Asian Finance Bank Bhd. in  Kuala
Lumpur .  The ringgit dropped 0.2 percent to 3.1885 per dollar as of
4:35 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 3.2045, its weakest level since Oct. 5.
The currency may decline to 3.21 this week, Nidzam said.  Singaporean non-oil domestic exports contracted 1.2 percent
from a year earlier in November after shrinking 16.2 percent in
October, according to the median  estimate  of 12 economists.  Malaysia’s overseas  sales  climbed 15.8 percent from a year
earlier in October, slower than 16.6 percent the month before,
according to a trade ministry statement on Dec. 9. Annual gains
in industrial output cooled to 2.8 percent last month after a
revised 3 percent increase in September, the statistics
department said Dec. 8.  Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on the
4.262 percent note due September 2016 held at 3.26 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
