Ethanol futures fell to the lowest
level in a year as corn dropped and the expiration of a
government subsidy approached.  Prices sank as corn declined amid speculation  global supply
of the grain  is adequate to meet demand for the food and biofuel
feedstock. A 45-cent tax credit to refiners for each gallon of
the biofuel blended into gasoline is set to expire Dec. 31.  “Corn certainly is one issue affecting them,” said  Rich Nelson , director of research at Allendale Inc. in McHenry,
 Illinois . “The second issue is, of course, the lower blending
subsidy in front of us and we have seen lower prices. We have
that big question in front of us and will have it for the next
couple weeks.”  Denatured ethanol for January delivery dropped 0.4 cents to
$2.062 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the lowest price
since Dec. 7, 2010. Futures fell for a fifth day, the longest
streak of losses since September, and are down 13 percent in
2011, heading for the first yearly decline since 2008.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago increased 2
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.19 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive climbed 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.31, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf rose 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to
$2.335 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel dropped 2.5
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.30.  Corn for March delivery lost 1.75 cents to $5.79 a bushel
in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
