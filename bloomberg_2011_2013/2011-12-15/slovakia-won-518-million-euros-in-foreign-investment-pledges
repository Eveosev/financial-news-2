Slovakia won more foreign direct
investment projects in 2011 compared with the previous year as
the eastern euro-region’s member improved conditions for doing
business to boost the inflow.  The state investment agency  Sario  negotiated 26 investment
projects worth 518 million euros ($673 million) this year,
compared with 8 projects in 2010 valued at 123 million euros,
according to a handout distributed to journalists today before a
press conference in Bratislava, Slovakia. The projects brokered
this year will create 4,354 jobs, Sario said.  The former communist country that adopted the euro in 2009
relies on foreign capital to boost export capacity and drive
economic  growth . The administration of Iveta Radicova, which
assumed power in July 2010, is working to eliminate bureaucracy
to make the country, which has become a region’s hub for
electronics and the car industry, more attractive for investors.  A plan by  Honeywell International Inc. (HON)  to build a 38
million-euro turbocharger plant creating more than 400 jobs was
one of the largest projects brokered by Sario. The agency’s data
don’t include investments destined for regions with below-
average unemployment, which aren’t entitled to receive state
aid, such as  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s plan to invest more than 1 billion
euros over five years to expand its assembly plant near the
capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
