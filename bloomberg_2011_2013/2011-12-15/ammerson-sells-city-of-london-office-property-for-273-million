Hammerson Plc (HMSO)  sold an eight-story
office building in the  City of London  financial district to a
company owned by the Kuwait government for 176 million pounds
($273 million).  St. Martins Property Investments Ltd. bought the building
at 60 Threadneedle Street for 11 million pounds above its
valuation on June 30, Hammerson, the U.K.’s third largest
publicly traded property company, said today in a statement. The
yield, or rent as a percentage of the purchase price, was about
4.75 percent.  Hammerson plans to use the proceeds “for future
refurbishment, development and acquisition opportunities,”
Chief Executive Officer David Atkins said in the statement.  Overseas investors own 52 percent of the buildings in  the
City of  London , compared with 50 percent in 2010 and 8 percent
in 1980, according to a report commissioned by Development
Securities Plc and published Nov. 22. Six percent of the
district’s properties had Middle East owners prior to the
Threadneedle Street deal, according to the report.  Tenants in the building include Talbot Underwriting,
Universities Superannuation Scheme, Berenberg Bank and The
Toronto Dominion Bank, Hammerson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
