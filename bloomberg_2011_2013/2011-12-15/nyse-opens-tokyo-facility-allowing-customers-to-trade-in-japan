NYSE Euronext (NYX) , the owner of the New
York Stock Exchange, opened a facility in Tokyo that lets
investors send orders to Japanese markets through the firm’s
systems rather than their building their own.  The NYSE Technologies said in a statement today that the
facility will help customers access equity markets in Japan,
whose corporations have the second-highest market value in the
world. It already has a connection with Hong Kong Exchanges &
Clearing Ltd. that lets customers send and receive orders. NYSE
runs similar co-location centers in the U.S. and U.K., and plans
additional facilities in Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada and
Brazil,  Eric Ryan , an NYSE spokesman, said in an e-mail.  The announcement follows an agreement to link  New York- 
based NYSE Euronext and Tokyo Stock Exchange Group Inc.’s
trading and data platforms. Investors use co-location centers to
place their systems near an exchange’s computers that match
buyers and sellers, reducing the amount of time it takes to
receive data and make trading decisions.  “In working with our customers to identify their primary
trading needs and opportunities, we found that Tokyo and the
surrounding Asian markets were a very high priority,”  Stanley Young , chief executive officer NYSE Technologies, said in
today’s statement. He said investors already using NYSE’s
platform would be able to connect to Japan in a few weeks
instead of creating their own infrastructure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
