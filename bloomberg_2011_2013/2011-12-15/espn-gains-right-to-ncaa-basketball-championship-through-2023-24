Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN sports cable
network reached an agreement extending its international rights
to the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s men’s
basketball for $500 million through 2023-2024.  The accord includes 600-plus hours and 300 telecasts of
live coverage annually across multiple media on the company’s
cable channels and online outlets, according to e-mailed

rights for access on computers, mobile phones and tablets. Fox
secured digital rights for its portion of NFL games, and ESPN’s

ESPN networks and platforms,” George Bodenheimer, president of
ESPN and ABC Sports, said in a statement.  Walt Disney , based in Burbank,  California , gained 0.09
percent to $35.19 at 3:50 p.m. New York time. The shares had
