Solar Millennium AG (S2M) , a German
developer of solar-power plants, said it halted orders for its
so-called bond 8 aimed at financing the companyâ€™s U.S. solar-
thermal projects.      Payments made for bonds that have not yet been deposited
into a securities account will be refunded, the company said
today in a website statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
