The  London Development Agency  has
shortlisted eight companies to develop offices and retail space
at Royal Albert Dock in the U.K. capital’s East End.  A  Canary Wharf Group Plc  unit, Dauphin Holdings Group Ltd.,
Micro World Developments Ltd., Muse Developments Ltd.,  St Modwen
Properties Plc (SMP) , Salmon Harvester Properties Ltd., Sinowest
Construction Group and Wrenbridge Land Ltd. were asked to submit
proposals for the 35-acre (14-hectare) site, the agency said in
a e-mailed statement today.  Plans to make the site a high-end market are “part of the
growing international confidence in the future of the Royal
Docks as a whole,” the agency’s chief executive officer, Lurene
Joseph, said in the statement.  Royal Albert Dock, located close to  London  City Airport and
the ExCeL London conference center, is a part of east London
where derelict docks, unused warehouses and industrial land are
being regenerated for use as offices and retail space.  A preferred developer for the site in the borough of Newham
will be selected by September, according to the e-mail. The
district, which is one of the most deprived areas in the U.K.,
will host next year’s  Olympic Games .  The Mayor of London,  Boris Johnson , shortlisted three
companies in October for a 1.5 billion pound ($2.3 billion)
redevelopment of the 50-acre Silvertown Quays site, which is
adjacent to Royal Albert Dock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
