Estonian employers and trade unions
reached a preliminary agreement on raising the minimum monthly
wage by 4.3 percent from January, citing the higher cost of
living and a government plan to raise pensions.  The minimum gross wage would rise to 290 euros ($377) from
the 278 euros that has been in force since 2008, according to a
 statement  published on the website of the Confederation of
Estonian Trade Unions yesterday. Details of the accord still
need to be agreed upon, it said.  “If pensions rise and wages don’t, that would increase
passivity in the labor market, which would be the wrong
signal,” Tarmo Kriis, the head of the Estonian Employers’
Confederation, said in the statement.  Under the 2012 state budget, approved in parliament this
month, pensions would rise 4.4 percent from April. The unions in
April sought a 17 percent increase in the minimum wage. Average
annual inflation may accelerate to 5.1 percent this year from
2.7 percent in 2010, the central bank said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
