Turkey will reduce its dependence on
natural gas imports from  Russia , its biggest fuel provider, and
cut energy costs with the construction of two nuclear plants,
Energy Minister  Taner Yildiz  said.  Three to four years of gas imports totaling as much as $7
billion annually to power electricity plants will cover the cost
of the two facilities, to be built on Turkey’s Mediterranean and
Black Sea coasts, Yildiz said today at a conference in Ankara,
according to state-run Anatolia news agency.  “We’re reducing our dependence on foreign providers by
establishing nuclear  power plants  with this money,” Yildiz
said. He said the Russian firms that will build the Akkuyu
facility in the southern province of Mersin are investing $700
million in the first phase of the $20 billion project.  Turkey is seeking to diversify its energy sources, as oil
and gas imports make up about half of the country’s $90 billion
trade deficit through October. A disagreement with  OAO Gazprom (GAZP) 
over discounts led to the cancellation of a contract for as much
as 6 billion cubic meters of annual gas purchases from Russia.  Rosatom Corp. and Atomstroyexport ZAO were picked by the
Turkish government to build the country’s first nuclear power
plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
