Sugar rose in New York on lower
supply from  Brazil , the world’s largest producer and exporter.
Cocoa and coffee declined.  Sugar-cane yields in Brazil’s Center South, the world’s top
producing region, fell to 69 metric tons a hectare (2.47 acres)
this year, the lowest in 24 years, Luiz Antonio Dias Paes, a
director at Brazilian sugar-cane research center CTC, said in
 Sao Paulo  this week. Before today, the sweetener plunged 29
percent this year as crops expanded in Russia and  Europe .  “Brazil may be down in their southern region in regards to
sugar production, which is helping to support prices,” said
 Hector Galvan , a senior commodities broker at RJO Futures in
 Chicago . “The sugar market is looking for direction on any
piece of news that’ll send it higher again.”  Raw sugar for March delivery gained 0.3 percent to 22.86
cents a pound at 10:59 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .
Prices fell 2.7 percent yesterday.  Sugar output in Brazil’s Center South, the world’s largest
producing region, dropped to 498,600 tons in the second half of
November from 1 million tons a year earlier, industry
association Unica said on Dec. 13. Global sugar supplies will
exceed demand by 4.4 million tons in the season started Oct. 1,
Societe Generale estimates.  Cocoa for March delivery dropped 1.8 percent $2,140 a
ton on ICE. Before today, the chocolate ingredient tumbled 28
percent this year.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery fell 0.3 percent
to $2.174 a pound. Before today, the price dropped 9.4 percent
in 2011.  In London futures trading, refined sugar advanced as
