InterMune Inc. (ITMN) , which won European
approval in February for lung-disease drug Esbriet, fell the
most since May 2010 after a German health agency said the
therapy offered little benefit to patients.  The  report , from the Institute for Quality and Efficiency
in Health Care, a group that offers recommendations to Germany’s
reimbursement authority, says Esbriet, also known as pirfenidone
has no or low additional benefit,  Brian Abrahams  of Wells Fargo
Securities wrote today in a note to clients.  “While the initial read of the documents appears somewhat
negative, we note that orphan drugs may be viewed differently as
they go through this process,” Abrahams said in the note.  Esbriet was approved in  Europe  to treat mild to moderate
 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , a lung disease that robs patients
of their ability to breathe and leads to death. The drug may
reach $513 million in sales by 2014, the average estimate of
four analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  InterMune, based in Brisbane, California, slid 30 percent
to $12.74 at the close of trading in New York. Shares have
declined 65 percent this year.  Jim Goff, a spokesman for InterMune, didn’t return an e-
mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
