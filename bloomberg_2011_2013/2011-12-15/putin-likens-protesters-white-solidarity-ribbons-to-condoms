Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  likened white ribbons worn by protesters last week in
Moscow to condoms.  “To be honest, when I saw on the TV screens what some
people had attached to themselves, it’s not very polite, I
thought it was an anti-AIDS campaign; I thought that they had
stuck condoms on themselves,” Putin said in a televised phone-
in show today. “My first thought was it’s okay, they are
campaigning for a healthy lifestyle.”  Tens of thousands of Russians protested in Moscow and other
cities on Dec. 10 against alleged fraud in Dec. 4 parliamentary
elections in the biggest anti-Putin demonstrations since he came
to power 12 years ago. Organizers at the rally in central
Moscow, on an island south of the Kremlin, handed out white
ribbons to the participants.  Soon after Putin’s comments, which were televised live
nationwide, bloggers circulated a photo mock-up of the Russian
leader posing for his annual New Year’s greeting in front of the
Kremlin, with a condom attached to his coat lapel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
