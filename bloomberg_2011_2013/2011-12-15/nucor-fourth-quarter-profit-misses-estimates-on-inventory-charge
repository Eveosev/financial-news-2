Nucor Corp. (NUE) , the largest U.S.
steelmaker by market value, forecast fourth-quarter profit that
missed analystsâ€™ estimates after reporting a larger-than-
expected inventory charge.  Earnings will be 22 cents to 27 cents a share, including a
16-cent charge for inventories held in the quarter, the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based company said in a statement
today. The average of 20 estimates compiled by Bloomberg is for
profit of 41 cents.  The inventory charge was about $50 million more than
expected because of higher scrap-metal costs, Nucor said.  Nucor fell less than 0.1 percent to $38.65 at 9:17 a.m. in
pre-market trading in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
