Ananth Narayan G., head of South
Asia currency and bonds trading at Standard Chartered Plc,
comments on the outlook for  India ’s currency after the  Reserve
Bank of India  tightened rules in forward trading in rupee,
saying canceled forward contracts can’t be bought again.  The new rules will take immediate effect, it said in a
statement on its website today.  “In the short-term this is definitely rupee positive and
will improve sentiment and show RBI is for curbing speculation.
It will bring down liquidity in the market and increase
transaction costs. Overall volume in the market will also come
down.  ‘‘Hopefully, this along with some intervention from the RBI
will buy time for the country to address medium-term issues such
as current account deficit and capital outflows, which are the
root cause of the rupee’s weakness.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
