Britons’ inflation expectations fell
last month and their satisfaction with the  Bank of England 
deteriorated as price growth remained at more than twice policy
makers’ 2 percent target.  U.K. consumers questioned in November expected prices to
increase 4.1 percent over the next year, the Bank of England
said in a quarterly survey published in  London  today. That
compares with a reading of 4.2 percent in August. A measure of
satisfaction with the Bank of England fell to a record low.  Inflation, which reached 5.2 percent in September, eased to
4.8 percent last month, and Bank of England Chief Economist
 Spencer Dale  said that it will slow “sharply” early next year
as the impact of a tax increase this year drops out. He also
said policy makers have scope to expand their bond-purchase
program beyond the current 275 billion-pound ($426 billion)
target if the debt crisis in Europe deepens.  Consumers’ satisfaction with the Bank of England fell to
the lowest since November 1999, when the survey was first
published, according to today’s report. Asked how well they
think the bank is setting  interest rates  to control inflation,
33 percent said they were satisfied and 25 percent were
dissatisfied. The net balance of 9 was down from 16 in August.  Asked about inflation in about five years’ time, the median
answer was 3.5 percent in November, unchanged from August.
Expectations for inflation in the 12 months starting November
2012 fell to 3.4 percent from 3.5 percent.  Asked to give the current rate of inflation, respondents
gave a median answer of 5 percent. The survey of 1,853 people by
GfK NOP was conducted between Nov. 3 and Nov. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
