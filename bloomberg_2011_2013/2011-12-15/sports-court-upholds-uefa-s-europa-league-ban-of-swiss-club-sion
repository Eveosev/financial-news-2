The Court of Arbitration for Sport
upheld  UEFA ’s decision to throw Swiss soccer club Sion out of
the Europa League for using ineligible players.  The Lausanne, Switzerland-based tribunal said in a
 statement  it backed the September ruling of the European
governing body that Sion used the ineligible players in winning
a two-match qualifying playoff against Celtic, which was given a
place in the tournament’s group stage.  Sion originally got an order from a Swiss court requesting
the club be re-instated, which UEFA rejected. The club also
lodged several appeals in the courts before taking its case to
CAS, which ruled in favor of UEFA today. Sion must also pay UEFA
40,000 Swiss francs ($42,000) to cover legal costs, CAS said.  Celtic faces Udinese in its final Europa League group match
tonight needing a victory to qualify for the round of 32.  To contact the reporter on this story:
