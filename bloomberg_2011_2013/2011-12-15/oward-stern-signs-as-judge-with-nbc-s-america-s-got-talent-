Sirius XM Radio Inc. host  Howard Stern  has signed with  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s  NBC Universal  to become a
judge on the reality TV show “America’s Got Talent.”  Stern, 57, will join next year when production of the
program moves to  New York , where he does his Sirius show, NBC
said in an e-mail today. Stern replaces CNN’s Piers Morgan, and
will join Sharon Osbourne and Howie Mandel as a judge.  NBC and Stern had discussed a contract that would pay the
so-called shock jock $15 million a year, a person familiar with
the situation said last month. NBC today didn’t disclose
financial details or the length of the contract.  NBC, based in New York, is seeking to boost its prime-time
TV ratings, which trail CBS, Fox and ABC. “America’s Got
Talent” was one of NBC’s most-watched shows in 2011 and had
more viewers than any summer series for the sixth year in a row.  Stern made the announcement this morning on his radio show,
which will continue. He signed a five-year contract with Sirius
last year after joining the satellite-radio company in 2006 for
$500 million.  “America’s Got Talent,” entering a seventh season after
its debut in 2006, is a competition talent show that awards the
winning individual or group a $1 million prize. The show is
produced by FremantleMedia  North America  and Simon Cowell’s SYCO
Television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
