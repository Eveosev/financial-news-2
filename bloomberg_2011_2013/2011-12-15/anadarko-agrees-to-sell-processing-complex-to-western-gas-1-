Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  agreed to
sell a natural-gas processing complex in  Wyoming  to an affiliate
for $483 million.  Western Gas Partners LP (WES)  will buy Anadarko’s interest in
Mountain Gas Resources LLC, which owns the Red Desert Complex,
according to a statement today.  The facility consists of two processing plants with a
combined capacity of 173 million cubic feet per day and 1,295
miles (2,084 kilometers) of gathering lines. Western Gas is also
buying a 22 percent interest in Rendezvous Gas Services LLC,
which owns a 338-mile gathering system in the Jonah and Pinedale
Anticline fields in southwest Wyoming.  “These assets are a great complement to our existing
footprint in the greater Green River Basin, which continues to
see solid resource development,”  Western Gas (WEC)  Partners Chief
Executive Officer Don Sinclair said in the statement.  Western Gas is a partnership set up by Anadarko to buy and
operate pipelines and processing plants, according to its
website. Both companies are based in The Woodlands, Texas.  Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc. acted as
Western Gas’s financial adviser, and Bracewell & Giuliani LLP
was its legal adviser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
