Russia ’s five largest oil companies
will fail to meet next year’s crude production target for the
Junin 6 project with Petroleos de  Venezuela  SA, said two company
officials with knowledge of the matter.  The  OAO Gazprom Neft -led group may produce no more than
10,000 barrels a day next year, about 20 percent of the planned
level, said the people, who work at different companies and who
declined to be identified because the matter is sensitive.
State-run OAO Rosneft, OAO Lukoil, TNK-BP and OAO Surgutneftegas
are partners.  Prime Minister Vladimir Putin’s deputy for energy,  Igor
Sechin , pledged the Russian group, which owns 40 percent of the
Junin 6 venture, would begin output in May and the field would
produce 50,000 barrels a day by the end of next year, while
meeting with Venezuelan Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez  in October.  Venezuela has turned to Russia for funds to accelerate
development of heavy tar-like crude fields of the Orinoco and
bolster waning output in South America’s largest oil-producing
nation. PDVSA, as the state company is known, owns the remaining
60 percent of the Junin 6 venture.  Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of Russia’s gas export monopoly,
said last year that the Junin 6 partners may spend $24 billion
to develop the project and that production may reach 450,000
barrels a day in 2017.  Consorcio Nacional Ruso, the Russian group, still aims to
reach the 50,000 barrel-a-day target, Gazprom Neft Chief
Executive Officer Alexander Dyukov said in October. Ekaterina
Stenyakina, a spokeswoman for the  oil company , declined to
comment today.  Oil output in Venezuela, a member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, slumped 24 percent to 2.47
million barrels a day in 2010 compared with 2000, according to
BP Plc  data . At the same time, the Orinoco has helped swell the
country’s oil reserves to 296.5 billion barrels, surpassing
 Saudi Arabia  as the world’s largest, according to OPEC.  A spokesman for PDVSA, who asked not to be named because of
company policy, declined to comment, saying he had no
information on the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
