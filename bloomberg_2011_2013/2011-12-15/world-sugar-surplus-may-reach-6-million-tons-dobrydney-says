World sugar production may exceed
demand by 5 million to 6 million metric tons in the year started
Oct. 1, said Jeff Dobrydney, a vice president for Wilton,
Connecticut-based Jenkins Sugar Group Inc.  That compares with a “modest” 1 million-ton surplus last
year, Dobrydney said during a presentation in  New York . This
season’s excess supplies may climb up to 8 million tons, “but
we lean more toward a surplus up to 6 million tons,” he said.
Prices may climb to 24 cents to 27 cents a pound next quarter,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
