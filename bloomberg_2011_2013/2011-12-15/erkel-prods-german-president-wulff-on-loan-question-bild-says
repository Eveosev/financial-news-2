German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
urged President  Christian Wulff  in a phone call to speak out
publicly on a loan he received from the wife of a businessman,
Bild reported, without saying how it got the information.  Merkel, in the phone call yesterday, criticized Wulff’s
handling of questions surrounding the home loan, which Bild
reported on Dec. 13, the newspaper said today. A spokesman for
Wulff, a member of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party,
issued a statement the same day saying there was no misconduct.  Wulff himself hasn’t addressed the matter. The loan totaled
500,000 euros ($659,000), Bild reported on Dec. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
