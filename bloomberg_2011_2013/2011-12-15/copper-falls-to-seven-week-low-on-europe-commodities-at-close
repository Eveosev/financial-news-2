24 commodities dropped 0.2 percent to 620.42 as of 4:54 p.m. in
 London . The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials was
little changed at 1,466.744.  BASE METALS  Copper fell to the lowest in more than seven weeks on
mounting concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will cripple the
global economy and metals demand.  Futures for March delivery fell 0.4 percent to $3.265 a

months slipped 0.2 percent to $7,197 a metric ton ($3.27 a

failed to announce more stimulus measures.  Gold futures for February delivery fell 0.9 percent to

percent the previous three days. A loss this quarter would be

weeks as U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly declined and
industrial production dropped for the first time in seven months
in November.  Crude for January delivery fell 10 cents to $94.85 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures traded between
$94.67 and $95.99. Yesterday, the contract fell to $94.95, the

this year after climbing 15 percent in 2010.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Sugar rose in New York on lower supply from  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer and exporter. Cocoa and coffee

declined, renewing demand for commodities as alternative
investments.  Orange juice  retreated.  Cotton futures for March delivery gained 0.2 percent to
85.28 cents a pound on ICE Futures in New York. Before today,
the fiber plunged 41 percent this year. The commodity touched
84.35 cents yesterday, the lowest since Aug. 24, 2010.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Soybean futures rose for the third time this week on
speculation that yields for South American crops will decline as
dry weather persists. Wheat was little changed, and corn fell.  Soybean futures for March delivery rose 0.5 percent to
$11.16 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Before today, the
price was down 21 percent this year.  Wheat futures for March delivery rose less than 0.1 percent

Brent oil decreased. The motor fuel’s crack, or premium to the
crude benchmark, widened to the highest level in six weeks.  Gasoline barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $888 to $895 a metric ton, according
to a Bloomberg survey of brokers and traders monitoring the
Argus Bulletin Board. That’s the lowest since Nov. 21 and
compares with yesterday’s deals from $902 to $922. European
Union and United Nations emission credits advanced from record
lows as equities rose.  NATURAL GAS  U.K. natural gas for the first quarter fell for a second
day amid record storage and below-normal heating demand even as
Britain exports fuel to  Belgium .  Gas for the first quarter, typically the period of highest
heating demand, dropped 0.5 pence, or 0.9 percent, to 57.15
pence a therm, according to broker prices compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s equal to $8.86 a million British thermal units and would
be the lowest close since November 2010. The contract has fallen
9.1 percent this year and 23 percent since the winter heating
season began on Oct. 1. Power for the first quarter slipped 25
pence to 44.81 pounds ($69.45) a megawatt-hour.  Natural gas futures rose in New York after a government
report showed that U.S. stockpiles fell more than expected last
week.  LIVESTOCK  To contact the reporter on this story:
