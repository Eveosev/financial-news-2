Hungary  should stay out of the euro
area for the time being, because it isn’t yet strong enough to
join and because the European currency is waging a “war” with
the dollar without adequate defenses, Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  said.  The euro area lacks a common political leadership and a
shared bond market and member-countries’ development levels are
too different for stability to be possible, Matolcsy wrote in a
book review for  Heti Valasz , a weekly newspaper.  While it’s in Hungary’s interest for the euro to survive, a
political union encroaching on its independence isn’t desirable,
Matolcsy said, adding that “we will wait with currency union.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
