Grain exports from the French port
of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, rose 13 percent
in the week ended yesterday as Cuba took the most wheat in more
than a year and cargoes destined for  Algeria  picked up.  Outbound grain amounted to 199,407 metric tons from Dec. 8
to Dec. 14 compared with 175,735 tons a week earlier, the  Seine
River port  said in an e-mailed report today. Export cargoes
included 189,182 tons of wheat, as well as barley and corn.  Morocco was the leading destination with 57,330 tons of
wheat, followed by Cuba with 48,902 tons of the grain, the most
since September 2010. Algeria, the biggest importer of French
grain, took 38,850 tons of wheat after nothing was shipped a
week earlier.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of  France ’s maritime grain
exports in 2009-10, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay,
which shipped out 19 percent, according to data from national
crops office FranceAgriMer.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
