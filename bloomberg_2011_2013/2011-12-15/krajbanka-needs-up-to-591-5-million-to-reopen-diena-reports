Latvijas Krajbanka AS, the Latvian
lender suspended by bank regulators on Nov. 21 due to missing
capital, needs up to 317 million lati ($591.5 million) to
reopen,  Diena  reported, citing the watchdog.  The lender is missing 167 million lati in capital, and
would need between 100 million lati to 150 million lati in
liquidity to reopen, said Janis Brazovskis, the deputy head of
the bank regulator, according to the Riga-based newspaper.  Any investor that would be interested in reopening the
lender would need to have transparent and good quality capital,
Brazovskis told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
