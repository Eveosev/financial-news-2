Natural catastrophes and man-made
disasters in 2011 cost insurers $108 billion, making it the
second-most-expensive year on record, according to estimates
from  Swiss Re Ltd.   Last year’s insured losses amounted to $48 billion,
according to an e-mailed statement from Swiss Re, the world’s
second-biggest reinsurer. Total economic losses may be around
$350 billion, according to preliminary estimates by the Zurich-
based reinsurer, compared with $226 billion in 2010.  Claims from natural catastrophes alone reached $103 billion
this year following the earthquake in  Japan , which could have
made 2011 the costliest year for the  insurance industry  if Japan
had been “more fully insured,” Swiss Re said. Hurricanes
Katrina, Wilma and Rita made 2005 the most expensive year on
record, with $123 billion in insured losses.  “Additional claims from the ongoing massive floods in
Thailand or from winter storms which may yet hit  Europe  have the
potential to bring figures for the full year even closer to the
record claims” in 2005, Swiss Re said.  The earthquake in Japan on March 11 and the ensuing tsunami
caused insured losses of $35 billion, while the Feb. 22 temblor
in  New Zealand  cost $12 billion. The floods in  Thailand  are
estimated to cost between $8 billion and $11 billion. Severe
storms in the U.S. in April and May cost about $14 billion,
while hurricane Irene is estimated to cost $4.9 billion.  “At more than $47 billion, earthquake-insured claims for
2011 are the highest ever recorded,” Swiss Re said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
