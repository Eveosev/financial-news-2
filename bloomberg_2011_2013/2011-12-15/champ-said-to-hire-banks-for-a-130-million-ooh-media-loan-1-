Champ  Private Equity  hired four
banks to help organize an about A$130 million ($129 million)
senior leveraged loan to fund its buyout of Australian outdoor
advertising company Ooh! Media Group Ltd., according to two
people familiar with the matter.  The five-year loan will comprise an acquisition debt
facility of about A$100 million, a tranche for capital
expenditure and a revolving credit facility for working capital,
the people said, asking not to be identified as details are
private.  Champ agreed to buy the shares it doesnâ€™t already own in
Ooh! Media earlier this week in a deal valuing the advertising
company at A$162.9 million. Ooh! Media investors should accept
the cash offer of 32.5 Australian cents a share, more than
double the stock price before the parties announced exclusive
talks Nov. 10, the Sydney-based company said in a Dec. 13
statement. Ooh! Media investors can also opt for a mix of cash
and unlisted stock.  The loan pays a margin of about 400 basis points over the
bank bill swap rate, the people said.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , GE Capital,  National
Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  and  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  are unlikely to
market the facility to other banks, one of the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
