WestLB AG, a state-owned German
lender, said the planned sale of real-estate unit Westdeutsche
ImmobilienBank AG to Apollo Global Management LLC failed because
the price offered was “not acceptable.”  “It was our declared aim to bring the sale negotiations to
a conclusion, also with a view to preserving jobs,” WestLB’s
Chief Executive Officer Dietrich Voigtlaender said in today’s
statement. “The further deterioration in the market environment
and the economic valuation leave us no choice. The transaction
and above all extended liability risks would be untenable for
the bank and its owners.”  In June, WestLB’s shareholders agreed with German
authorities and the bank to split the state-owned lender in a
bid to win European Union approval for aid received during the
global financial crisis. Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen
Girozentrale is in talks with WestLB to take over its so-called
Verbundbank, which will serve regional savings banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
