The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 10:15 a.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  rose 0.5 percent to 12,468.27, while the
Colcap Index gained 0.5 percent to 1,551.19.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  , Colombia’s largest oil company,
rose 0.9 percent to 4,140 pesos. The company said it won rights
to blocks in the U.S. Gulf of  Mexico  as it expands exploration
for crude and natural gas.  The seven blocks will increase to 119 the number of areas
in the Gulf where Ecopetrol has exploration rights alone or with
partners, the company said today in a statement on the website
of Colombia’s securities regulator.  Empresa de Energia de Bogota SA (EEB)  , Colombia’s
second-biggest electricity distributor, gained 3.3 percent to
1,100 pesos.  The company is rebounding after  Colombia ’s securities
regulator suspended trading of the shares Dec. 7 following a 17
percent plunge over three days, said Juan David Ballen, analyst
at Alianza Valores SA.  He said investors have relaxed since the company said Dec.
13 the plunge was not justified by its financial results and
that 80 percent of its income comes from investments in other
companies, which allows it to have a “stable and growing flow
of cash and dividends for its shareholders.”  Bogota mayor-elect Gustavo Petro has said his comments on
plans to merge the electricity company with other city-
controlled utilities did not cause the decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
