The following is the text of the
Philadelphia area manufacturing activity from the  Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia .  Dec-11  Responses to the Business Outlook Survey this month suggest that
regional manufacturing continued to improve in December. All of
the broad indicators remained positive and suggest a modest
expansion of activity.  Increases in input prices were more
widespread this month, and there was an uptick in the number of
firms reporting increased prices for their own goods. The
broadest indicator of future activity reflected a trend of
increased optimism about growth over the next six months.  Indicators Suggest Continued Expansion  The diffusion index of current activity, the survey’s broadest
measure of manufacturing conditions, remained positive for the
third consecutive month and increased from 3.6 in November to
10.3. The percentage of firms reporting increases in activity
(25 percent) exceeded the percentage reporting decreases (15
percent).  The index for current new orders showed a similar
improvement, increasing 8 points.  The shipments index, at 6.7,
was mostly flat. Twice as many firms reported declines in
inventories (30 percent) as reported increases (15 percent) and
the current inventory index fell 22 points to -14.9.  Labor market conditions continue to show overall improvement,
but indexes edged down this month. Twenty percent of the firms
reported an increase in employment; 10 percent reported a
decrease.  The current employment index remained positive at
10.7, only 1 point lower than in November.   The average
workweek index also remained positive but fell nearly 9 points.  Prices for Manufactured Goods Edge Higher  Increasing costs were more widespread this month compared to
last month. The percentage of firms reporting higher input costs
increased from 31 percent in November to 41 percent this month.
The prices paid diffusion index increased 11 points.  The percentage of firms reporting increases in prices for their
manufactured goods (22 percent) was higher than that reporting
decreases (10 percent).  The prices received diffusion index
increased 9 points, to its highest reading in seven months.  Six-Month Indicators Continue to Improve  Indicators for future activity continued to improve this month.
The broadest indicator of future activity increased 2 points; it
has now increased for four consecutive months and is at its
highest reading in nine months (see Chart). The index for future
new orders also improved, increasing 8 points.  Although
employment forecasts remain generally positive, the future
employment index fell 13 points. The percentage of firms
expecting to increase employment over the next six months (24
percent) is significantly higher than the percentage expecting
to decrease employment (11 percent).  In this month’s special questions, firms were asked about their
expectations for changes in various categories of input and
labor costs for the coming year (see Special Questions). Similar
to responses in previous years, current responses indicate that
the largest annual increase is expected to be for health
benefits (7.3 percent). In contrast, other labor costs (wages
and non-health-care costs) are expected to rise only 2.1 and 2.5
percent, respectively. All other nonlabor expense categories are
expected to increase in 2012: energy (1.8 percent), raw
materials (3.3 percent), and intermediate goods (2.4 percent).
Firms were also asked how the expected cost increases will
compare to 2011 costs. In every category, the percentage of
firms indicating that their costs would be higher in 2012 was
greater than the percentage reporting that their costs would be
lower.  Summary  According to respondents to the December Business Outlook Survey,
the region’s manufacturing sector is showing continued
improvement at year-end. Indicators for general activity, new
orders, shipments, and employment all suggest growth this month.
Firms’ outlook for future manufacturing growth, as measured by
the survey’s six-month indicators, continued to improve this
month.  Special Questions (December 2011)  1. What percentage change in costs do you expect for the
