     Dec. 15 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  fell for a third day
after manufacturing sentiment worsened and rising financing
costs fueled concern  Europe  is losing its fight against debt.  Toshiba Corp. (6502) , a maker of  laptop computers , home appliances
and power plants, dropped 3.8 percent. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd.
led declines among top shipping companies as cargo rates fell.
Nintendo Co., which depends on Europe for a third of its sales,
dropped 2 percent as a weakening euro eroded the gamemaker’s
profit. Olympus Corp. plunged after restated earnings showed the
camera-maker inflated its assets by $1.3 billion.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 1.7 percent to 8,377.37
at the 3 p.m. trading close in  Tokyo . The broader Topix index
dropped 1.6 percent to 725.02 after the Bank of Japan’s Tankan
survey showed Europe’s crisis and gains in the yen have dented
confidence at some of the country’s biggest companies.  “ Japan  is highly vulnerable to overseas factors,” said
Naoteru Teraoka, general manager at Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui
Asset Management Co., which oversees about $29 billion.
“Europe’s situation doesn’t seem to be moving in a positive
direction, while the euro has fallen a lot against the yen --
another headache for exporters.”  An  index  of sentiment among large manufacturers fell to
minus 4 from 2, the central bank said today in Tokyo. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a reading of minus 2. A negative
number means pessimists outnumber optimists. Japan’s biggest
manufacturers said they expect conditions to worsen next quarter.  Floods, Earthquake  Europe’s crisis has hurt Japan’s export-driven economy.
Floods in  Thailand  and Japan’s worst earthquake on record have
added to the damage, disrupting production at companies from
Toyota Motor Corp. to  Sony Corp. (6758)  The  Topix  has plunged 19
percent this year, almost as much as the 21 percent decline on
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Japanese manufacturers plunged today after the Tankan
showed confidence eroding.  Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. (6305) 
fell 4.1 percent 1,298 yen. Daikin Industries Ltd., a maker of
air conditioners, slid 2.8 percent to 2,133 yen.  Toshiba fell 3.8 percent to 328 yen. The maker of
everything from nuclear power plants to flash memory chips also
dropped after a brokerage cut its price target for  Sumco Corp. (3436) ,
a top supplier of silicon wafers for semiconductors and a
bellwether of industry demand.  Sumco sank 8.3 percent to 578 yen, the lowest since at
least November 2005, after SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. cut its
12-month price estimate to 700 yen. Separately, Credit Suisse
Group AG said the earnings environment “remains severe” for
Sumco because of slumping demand for personal computers.  Shipping Slide  The  shipping sector (TPMART)  declined today the most among the 33
Topix industry groups. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Japan’s second-
largest line by sales, slid 5.5 percent to 273 yen. Nippon Yusen
K.K., the No. 1, dropped 4.6 percent to 187 yen.  The Topix group that tracks container lines has fallen by
half this year. Shippers are losing money on Asia-Europe routes
after slashing rates more than 50 percent in 2011 due to a price
war and excess capacity.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  dropped 0.5
percent today. The index fell 1.1 percent in New York yesterday
after Italy was forced to offer the highest yields in 14 years
to sell five-year bonds.  Stocks (TPX)  also fell after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told U.S. senators the Fed plans no
additional aid to Europe, according to two lawmakers who
attended the meeting.  ‘No Visible Progress’  “There’s no visible progress on Europe’s debt crisis,”
said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $600 million in Tokyo
at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “There are no events
that may buoy the mood, and there’s no guarantee that the euro
will stop weakening. The euro may drop below 100 yen,
compounding the situation for export-related stocks.”  Exporters declined after the shared currency slid to 101.10
yen yesterday, the lowest level since Oct. 4. Nintendo dropped 2
percent to 10,900 yen.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , Japan’s second-largest
carmaker by market value, slid 1.8 percent to 2,290 yen.  Olympus plunged 21 percent to 1,041 yen. The company
yesterday filed corrected financial statements for more than
five years and took a $1.3 billion hit in net assets. The shares
have lost more than half their value since Oct. 14, when
allegations emerged the company overpaid advisors. Olympus has
said it used the payments to hide investment losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
