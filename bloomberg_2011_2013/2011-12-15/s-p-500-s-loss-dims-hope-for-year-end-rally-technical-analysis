The decline in the  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index (SPX)  this year means there are lower odds the measure will
rally during the last two weeks of 2011, if history is any
guide, according to Nautilus Capital LLC.  Since 1928, the benchmark index has rallied at year-end
60 percent of the time when it had fallen year to date, compared
with 80 percent when it rose, data from Nautilus show. The S&P
500 produced an average gain of 1.3 percent during the last two
weeks of the year.  The S&P 500 declined 3.6 percent this year through
yesterday amid concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will slow global
economic growth. Its retreat yesterday pushed the index below
both its 50-day and 200-day average for the first time since
Aug. 1, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That tends to
be the riskiest time to own stocks, said Tom Leveroni, chief
market strategist at Nautilus, a  Lake Forest , Illinois-based
research firm.  “With end of 2011 now only 11 trading days away, many are
wondering whether a ‘Santa Claus’ rally can salvage a dismal and
volatile year,” Leveroni wrote in a note today. “Though
historical odds favor some type of bounce between now and year
end, we would not bet on it this year.”  The  S&P 500  slumped the first three days of this week as
growing funding stress in Europe fueled concern the region is
struggling to contain the debt crisis. While it rebounded today,
it didn’t exceed the 50-day average.  The last time the gauge sank below both its 50-day and 200-
day average, it dropped 15 percent before hitting bottom at this
year’s closing low of 1,099.23 on Oct. 3, according to Bloomberg
data. A similar slump now would take the measure to 1,030, from
yesterday’s close of 1,211.82.  The S&P 500 has spent 24 percent of the time since 1928
trading below both the averages, according to data from
Nautilus. During these times, the index fell at an annualized
rate of 7.2 percent, compared with a gain of 11.5 percent for
the rest of the time, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
