Canada ’s Senate voted today to
abolish the Canadian Wheat Board’s marketing monopoly, paving
the way for farmers in the country’s main growing region to sell
their own wheat and barley for the first time since 1943.  The Conservative-backed bill, which passed the House of
Commons Nov. 28, only needs royal assent from Canada’s Governor
General David Johnston before becoming law.  Liberal Party leaders have asked Johnston to withhold
assent until after a court review. The Wheat Board filed a
motion yesterday to stop the legislation from going into effect,
after a Winnipeg Federal Court found Dec. 7 that the bill was
illegal because the government didn’t conduct a vote among
farmers on the issue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
