Veolia Environnement SA (VIE)  should find
a financial investor to partner with French state-owned bank
Caisse des Depots et Consignations to take over Veolia’s
Transdev transport business, as the company doesn’t need new
leadership, CDC Chief Executive Officer Augustin de Romanet de
Beaune said in an interview, according to Le Figaro today.  “The sooner a solution is found” for Transdev, formed
when Veolia and CDC merged their transport businesses, “the
better for the company, its clients and employees,” de Romanet
said, according to the newspaper. Veolia has set a two-year
calendar for the operation, Le Figaro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
