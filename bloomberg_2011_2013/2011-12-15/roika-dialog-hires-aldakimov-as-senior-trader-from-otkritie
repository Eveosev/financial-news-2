Troika Dialog , the Russian brokerage
being acquired by  OAO Sberbank , hired Yuri Aldakimov as a senior
equity trader from Otkritie Financial Corp. as it seeks to
recruit 40 bankers to compete with state rival VTB Capital.  Aldakimov, who was head of special situations at Otkritie,
previously worked for Citigroup Inc. in Moscow as head of
Russian equity trading, according to an e-mailed statement from
Troika today.  The company, Moscowâ€™s oldest brokerage, said last month it
wants to increase its investment-banking staff of 100 by 25
percent to 40 percent in the next year to 14 months.  Sberbank Chief Executive Officer  German Gref , a former
economy minister, wants to turn the savings bank into a full-
service financial firm that can compete at home and abroad on
everything from bond underwriting to  stock trading . Gref told
employees on Dec. 2 the acquisition of Troika would close by
mid-February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
