Nigeria ’s naira appreciated for the
first time in four days against the dollar on bets that the
central bank and some  oil companies  sold the U.S. currency.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer gained 0.3
percent to 162.20 per dollar as of 4:05 p.m. in Lagos, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nigeria sold $250 million at a
foreign-currency auction yesterday, less than the $256.7 million
 demanded  by lenders, with the marginal rate, which is also used
as the prevailing exchange rate at 156.70 per dollar, unchanged
from the previous auction, according to the  Central Bank of
Nigeria .  “Oil companies and the central bank sold an unspecified
amount of dollars to some banks yesterday, which has helped to
ease the shortfall at the official auction and lifted naira in
today’s trading,” Tunde Ladipo, chief executive of Lagos-based
Valuechain Investment Ltd., said by phone today. Muhammed
Abdullahi, a spokesman for the central bank in Abuja, didn’t
immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment.  The central bank on Nov. 21 lowered the midpoint of its
exchange-rate band at the auctions to 155 naira per dollar from
150 naira as rising imports and weakening oil prices increased
pressure on the currency. Sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest
economy depends on oil exports for more than 95 percent of
foreign income, according to the  Finance Ministry .  Ghana’s cedi depreciated by 0.1 percent to 1.6398 per
dollar as of 4:10 p.m. in Accra, the nation’s capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
