“Crucify him!” shouted people
crowding the courthouse as the prisoner arrived. Levi Weeks was
on trial for the murder of Elma Sands, a young Quaker girl who
lived in the same boardinghouse. She’d been strangled, her body
dumped into a Manhattan well just before Christmas, 1799.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  To defend his brother, Ezra Weeks hired eminent lawyers --
and bitter rivals --  Alexander Hamilton  and Aaron Burr, both of
whom owed him money. They established an alibi for Levi, and, in
a surprise move, Burr produced a witness who revealed that the
dead girl had been having an affair with the married
boardinghouse owner.  After the longest murder trial in  New York  City’s history,
it took the jury just a few minutes to reach a verdict of not
guilty.  I spoke with Paul Collins, author of “Duel With the
Devil,” on the following topics:  1. Mysterious Disappearance.  2. Body in Well.  3. Eminent Politicians.  4. Cloud of Witnesses.  5. Prosecutor’s Case Dismantled.  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
