The pound rallied from a two-week low
against the dollar as a gauge of construction output based on a
survey of  purchasing managers  exceeded analyst forecasts,
signaling Britain’s recovery is strengthening.  The U.K. currency rose for a second day versus the euro
after the National Institute of Economic and Social Research
said Britain’s economy will grow faster this year than
previously predicted as consumers increase spending. The pound
advanced against all 16 of its major currencies as U.S. data
showed American employers added fewer jobs in July than
economists estimated. Gilts fell for a third day.  “The global market will reassess where the U.K. economy is
heading,” said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund sales at
Mizuho Bank Ltd. in  London . “The economy is in better shape and
will be in better shape than we are currently giving credit for
in foreign-exchange markets.”  The pound rose 1.1 percent to $1.5285 at 4:43 p.m. London
time, gaining for the first time in six days. It earlier touched
$1.5102, the least since July 17. The U.K. currency gained 0.5
percent to 86.88 pence per euro, strengthening for a second day.  An index of  construction activity  jumped to 57 for July,
from 51 in June, Markit and the  Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply  in London said in a statement today.
That’s the highest since June 2010. The median estimate of 13
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for 51.5. A reading
above 50 indicates expansion.  House Prices  U.K.  house prices  rose 0.8 percent in July, from 0.3
percent the previous month,  Nationwide Building Society  said.
Values increased to an average 170,825 pounds, the most since
June 2008. The nation’s gross domestic product will expand 1.2
percent this year and 1.8 percent in 2014, compared with
forecasts in May of 0.9 percent and 1.5 percent respectively,
Niesr said today.  U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose by 162,000 in July, less than
the median estimate for 185,000 in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists.  Gilts fell, pushing 10-year yields to a three-week high, as
the economic data diminished demand for the safest U.K.
government assets.  “The U.K. data is not constructive for gilts,” said Jason Simpson, a U.K. rates strategist at Banco Santander SA in
London. “All the survey data for July rose and surprised on the
upside giving further evidence that the economic recovery has
legs and is gathering momentum.”  Gilt Yields  Yields on the 10-year  gilt  rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.42 percent after rising to 2.49 percent,
the highest since July 9. The price of the 1.75 percent bond due
September 2022 dropped 0.16 or 1.60 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 94.54. Two-year and 30-year gilt yields reached the
highest levels since July 25, at 0.38 percent and 3.62 percent,
respectively.  Gilts lost 5.2 percent in the past three months, according
to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes, as economic data pointed to
growing strength in the British and U.S. economies. Treasuries
slid 4.2 percent and German bunds declined 2.1 percent.  Sterling has advanced 1 percent in the past three months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. The euro rose 4.7 percent and
the dollar gained 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
