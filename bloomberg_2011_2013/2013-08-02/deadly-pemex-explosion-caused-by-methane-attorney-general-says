The Jan. 31 explosion that killed at
least 37 Petroleos Mexicanos employees at company headquarters
in  Mexico  City was caused by methane gas and contributing
factors, the Attorney General’s office said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Prosecutors confirmed methane gas combined with traces of
hydrocarbons beneath the building triggered the explosion.
Vapors from solvents also contributed to the explosion, which
was a result of methane being ignited by electric cables used
for maintenance, according to the statement.  The Mexico City headquarters was used to store hydrocarbons
eight decades ago, according to the statement. More than 100
employees were injured in the blast and site operations were
shut down for a week.  Pemex, as the state-owned oil company is known, is Latin
America’s largest crude producer and funds about a third of
Mexico’s federal budget. President Enrique Pena Nieto is
expected to submit a bill to congress next week that would
increase private sector investment in the energy sector and open
up Pemex’s monopoly to competition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
