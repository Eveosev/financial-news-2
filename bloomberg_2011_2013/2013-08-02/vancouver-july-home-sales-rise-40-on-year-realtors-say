Home sales in  Canada ’s two largest
real estate markets soared in July, adding to evidence housing
has defied predictions of a correction.  Sales in  Toronto , the largest market, rose 16 percent from
a year earlier to 8,544 units, while Vancouver’s existing home
sales rose 40 percent, the cities’ real estate  board s said
today. The average sale price in Toronto rose 7.9 percent and
increased 13 percent in Vancouver.  Housing-market data are showing few signs of a hard landing
even amid warnings from analysts and policy makers that a bubble
may have been forming. Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty
tightened mortgage rules for a fourth time last year on concern
that an overbuilding of condos could lead to sharp price
declines.  “We are a year removed from the onset of stricter mortgage
lending guidelines,” Dianne Usher, Toronto Real Estate Board
President, said in the statement. “Many households who put
their decision to purchase a home on hold have reactivated their
search.”  The average sale price in Toronto rose to C$513,246
($493,790) in July from C$475,523 a year earlier, the Toronto
Real Estate Board  said .  Average Prices  The number of homes sold in  Vancouver  totaled 2,946 units
during the month, compared with 2,098 units a year earlier, the
Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said today in an e-mailed
statement. The figure was 0.1 percent above the 10-year sales
average for the month, it said.  The average sales price in Vancouver rose 13 percent from a
year ago to C$758,730 as more expensive detached homes were
sold. A benchmark price index for homes in the city was
C$601,900 in July, down 2.3 percent from a year earlier and up
2.3 percent over the last six months, it said.  “Demand has strengthened in our market in the last few
months, which can, in part, be attributed to pent-up demand from
the slowdown in sales activity we saw at the end of last year,”
said Sandra Wyant, president of the Vancouver realtor group.  Calgary’s real estate board said yesterday home  sales  in
that city rose 17 percent in July, with average prices rising 8
percent from a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
