 Fast food workers  struck  earlier this week over their low wages, agitating for a hike to $15 an hour. This has led to a lot of nonsense being talked about minimum wages. From the right I heard that minimum wages lead to massive disemployment, and McDonalds can’t raise prices because, if it could, it would have already. From the left, I saw  grave accounting errors , and  enthusiastic overstatement  of the “new consensus” on the minimum wage. So it seems worth reviewing a few things: Does that mean that McDonalds could give in to worker demands with only a paltry impact on profits or sales? Not so fast, friend. There are some other considerations. I’ve been doing this too long to think that any of this is going to change anyone’s opinion of the minimum wage. But at least we don’t have to say silly things while we’re debating it.
