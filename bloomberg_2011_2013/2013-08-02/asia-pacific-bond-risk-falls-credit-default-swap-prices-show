The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default decreased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index slid 2.5 basis points to 96
basis points as of 9:39 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The measure is on track for its lowest close since July
24, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan lost 1 basis point to 142 basis points
as of 8:44 a.m. in Hong Kong,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices show.
The gauge fell 5.9 basis points last month in its first decline
since April, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 1 basis point to
119 basis points as of 10:35 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. The index fell 13.8 basis points
last month, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
