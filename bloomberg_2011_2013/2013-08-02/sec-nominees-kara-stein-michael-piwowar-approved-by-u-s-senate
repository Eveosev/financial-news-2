Former U.S. Senate aides Michael Piwowar and Kara M. Stein won confirmation as members of the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The current SEC chairman
Mary Jo White was also confirmed to a full term that expires
June 5, 2019.  Senators backed the nominations today by unanimous consent
in the final hours before the chamber adjourned for its summer
recess. President  Barack Obama  nominated Stein and Piwowar on
May 23 and they were approved by the Senate Banking Committee on
July 18.  Stein, 49, and Piwowar, 45, join the SEC as it adapts to a
new agenda under White, who says the agency’s rulemaking
priorities are prescribed by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 and the
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012.  Stein replaces Elisse B. Walter as a Democratic
commissioner and Piwowar succeeds Republican Troy A. Paredes on
the five-member commission. Stein served as a top aide to
Senator  Jack Reed , a Rhode Island Democrat, and Piwowar was the
Banking Committee’s chief Republican economist.  White had previously been confirmed to fill out the term of
former SEC chairman  Mary Schapiro  that expired in June 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
