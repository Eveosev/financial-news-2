A horse slaughterhouse in  New Mexico 
that’s opposed by the state’s attorney general and the U.S.
 Humane Society  was temporarily barred by a federal judge from
beginning operations.  The Humane Society sued the U.S. Agriculture Department,
for agreeing, without an environmental review, to provide
inspectors so that the Roswell plant and one in Iowa could start
operations. New Mexico Attorney General Gary King said he was
pleased U.S. District Judge Christina Armijo in  Albuquerque 
today suspended the grant of inspection for the Roswell
slaughterhouse.  “Federal inspectors are also barred from further
involvement with the facilities,” King said in an e-mailed
statement.  Valley Meat Co. of Roswell is one of several companies that
have asked the Agriculture Department to provide inspectors. A
federal law barring funding for such inspections lapsed in 2011.  A. Blair Dunn, a lawyer for Valley Meat, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment on Armijo’s order.  “We’ve won a temporary but life-saving reprieve for
horses,”  Wayne Pacelle , chief executive officer of the Humane
Society, said in an e-mailed statement. “We’ll continue to make
arguments when our case resumes in a month that these plants
cannot legally operate because of inadequate environmental
review.”  The case is Front Range Equine Rescue v. Vilsack, U.S.
District Court, District of New Mexico (Albuquerque).
