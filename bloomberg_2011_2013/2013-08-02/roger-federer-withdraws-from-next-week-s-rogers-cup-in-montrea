Men’s Grand Slam record holder  Roger
Federer  has withdrawn from next week’s Rogers Cup tennis
tournament in Montreal, Canada.  The 17-time major singles champion from Switzerland said on
his Facebook today he was “disappointed” not to be playing the
event.  Although he didn’t give a reason for his withdrawal,
Federer had told reporters during an event in Gstaad,
Switzerland last month that he’s been struggling with a back
injury.  Federer, a former world No. 1, has slumped to No. 5 on the
rankings of the men’s ATP World Tour this season. He was knocked
out of Wimbledon in the second round,  his earliest loss at the
tournament he’s won seven times since 2002.  The  U.S. Open , the season’s final major, starts Aug. 26 in
 New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
