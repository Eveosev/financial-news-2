Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TRQ) , a unit
of Rio Tinto Group, cut the price of a stake in a Kazakh gold
mine that it agreed to sell by 22 percent because of a decline
in the precious metal’s price.  Sumeru Gold BV will pay $235 million for the 50 percent
stake in Altynalmas Gold Ltd., down from the $300 million agreed
to in February, Vancouver-based Turquoise Hill said today in a
statement. Altynalmas owns the Kyzyl gold project in  Kazakhstan .  Rio, the world’s second-largest mining company, owns 51
percent of Turquoise Hill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
