Brazil ’s real climbed from a four-year low as U.S. employers added fewer jobs than forecast in
July, easing concern that the  Federal Reserve  will curtail a
stimulus program that has supported emerging-market assets.  The currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 2.2977 per U.S.
dollar at 9:51 a.m. in Sao Paulo, paring its decline this week
to 1.9 percent. The real closed yesterday weaker than 2.3 per
dollar for the first time in four years. Swap rates on contracts
maturing in January 2015 fell 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 9.73 percent, reducing their increase since
July 26 to 33 basis points.  “We will continue to have this volatility until the Fed
begins to unwind the stimulus, and it can be measured by the
market,”  Reginaldo Galhardo , currency manager at Treviso
Corretora in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone interview.  The real has tumbled 13 percent in the past three months,
the biggest drop among 24 emerging-market dollar counterparts. A
weaker currency makes imports more expensive and threatens to
further fuel inflation, which helped spark nationwide street
protests in June.  The 162,000 increase in U.S. payrolls last month was the
smallest in four months and followed a revised 188,000 rise in
June that was less than initially estimated, the Labor
Department reported today in Washington. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 185,000 gain. The
 unemployment rate  dropped to 7.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
