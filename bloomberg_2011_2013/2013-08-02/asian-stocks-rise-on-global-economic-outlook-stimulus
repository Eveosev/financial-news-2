Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark index heading for its biggest advance in three weeks,
after global manufacturing reports beat forecasts and central
banks vowed to maintain stimulus.  Honda Motor Co., which gets about 83 percent of sales
outside of  Japan , advanced 2.9 percent, pacing gains among
exporters after the yen fell the most since April. Sharp Corp.,
which supplies screens to Apple Inc., rose 3.4 percent in Tokyo
after posting a narrower loss than expected. Hutchison Whampoa
Ltd., controlled by Asia’s richest person  Li Ka-shing , jumped
4.5 percent in Hong Kong after reporting profit that surpassed
expectations amid growth at its infrastructure business.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 1 percent to 134.9 as
of 7:42 p.m. Tokyo time, with more than two shares rising for
each that fell. All 10 industry groups rose on the gauge. The
measure is heading for a 0.4 percent decline this week, its
first such drop in six weeks.  “The bulls have regained control,” Matthew Sherwood, head
of markets research in Sydney at Perpetual Investments, which
manages about $25 billion, said in an e-mail. “Fears eased
about the global economy and reassuring comments from central
banks confirmed that the money glut will continue.”  Factory output from the U.S. to  China  and Europe expanded
in July, reports yesterday showed, while American jobless claims
fell to a five-year low. The data came as European Central Bank
President Mario Draghi said interest rates will probably remain
low for an extended period and after the Federal Reserve
retained its $85 billion-a-month bond buying program.  Regional Gauges  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 1.3 percent last month
after China pledged to do more to support a transition from
reliance on exports to domestic demand in the world’s second-largest economy. Shares on the gauge traded at 13 times
estimated earnings as of yesterday, compared with 15.5 times for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 13.7 times for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index.  Japan’s  Topix index  climbed 2.8 percent and the benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average jumped 3.3 percent today, with both
gauges closing higher for a second day. South Korea’s Kospi
index added 0.1 percent, while  Taiwan ’s Taiex index rose 0.5
percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index closed 1.1 percent higher
and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index increased 0.8 percent.  Japan’s Topix has climbed 39 percent this year amid
optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will push through reforms
while the Bank of Japan continues record stimulus to beat
deflation.  Worst Performance  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  was little changed and the
Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies in Hong
Kong added 0.1 percent. The city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index
climbed 0.5 percent. The measure fell 2.5 percent this year
through yesterday, the worst performance among developed markets
tracked by Bloomberg.  China’s non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index is
scheduled to be released tomorrow. The nation’s manufacturing
gauge unexpectedly strengthened in July, data yesterday showed.  Indonesia ’s Jakarta Composite Index added 0.2 percent,
paring an earlier advance of 0.7 percent. The nation’s economic
growth slowed to 5.8 percent in the second quarter from 6
percent in the previous three months, according to government
figures released today. That compares with the median estimate
of 5.9 percent in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rose 0.1 percent
ahead of nonfarm-payroll and unemployment data today. The U.S.
benchmark gauge jumped 1.3 percent yesterday, sending it above
1,700 for the first time as a report showed applications for
unemployment insurance payments declined by 19,000 to 326,000 in
the week ended July 27, the fewest since January 2008, from a
revised 345,000 the prior week.  Factory Output  The Institute for Supply Management’s U.S. factory index
increased to 55.4 in July, the strongest since June 2011, from
50.9 in the prior month. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.
Labor Department data today may show U.S. employers added
185,000 people to payrolls in July as the jobless rate fell to
7.5 percent from 7.6 percent, according to Bloomberg surveys of
more than 80 economists.  Manufacturing growth in the U.K. accelerated in July, while
a factory gauge for the euro-area resumed growth after two years
of contraction, separate reports released yesterday showed.  Automakers advanced, leading Asian exporters higher, as
companies reported increased sales in the U.S. last month.
Honda, whose sales beats analyst estimates, climbed 2.9 percent
to 3,710 yen in  Tokyo . Toyota, the world’s largest carmaker,
gained 3.4 percent to 6,430 yen before reporting first-quarter
earnings that beat estimates.  Sharp, Hutchison  Sharp rose 3.4 percent to 425 yen in Tokyo. The company
posted a first-quarter net loss of 18 billion yen ($182
million), compared with a 138 billion yen loss a year earlier.
That was lower than the median loss estimate of 24 billion yen
by three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Hutchison Whampoa jumped 4.5 percent to HK$91.65 in Hong
Kong. Net income rose 23 percent to HK$12.4 billion ($1.6
billion) in the six months through June, the Hong Kong-based
company said yesterday. That compares with the HK$10.8 billion
median of three analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg News.
Neptune Orient Lines Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group are scheduled to
report next week.  Of the 283 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
have posted results since July 1 and for which estimates are
available, 51 percent exceeded estimates, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. More than 90 companies on the gauge are
posting results this month.  Sembcorp Marine Ltd. (SMM) , the world’s second-largest oil-rig
builder, dropped 3.3 percent to S$4.42 in  Singapore  after
second-quarter profit fell 13 percent from a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
