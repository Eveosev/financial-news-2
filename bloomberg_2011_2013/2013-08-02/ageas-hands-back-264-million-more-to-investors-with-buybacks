Ageas SA (AGS) , the majority owner of
Belgium’s biggest life insurer, will return an additional 200
million euros ($264 million) to investors through share buybacks
after reporting second-quarter profit that exceeded estimates.  Insurance profit in the three months through June rose 16
percent to 171.9 million euros, led by lower taxation of
investment returns in Belgium and a property gain in  Turkey , the
Brussels-based company said today in a statement. Net income of
178.6 million euros surpassed the 155.4 million-euro average
estimate of seven analysts in a Bloomberg survey and included an
additional 42 million euros from the sale of Royal Park
Investments.  Ageas said it will start buying back as much as 200 million
euros of stock, in addition to an  extraordinary  distribution of
1 euro a share to be paid in December, and will give an update
at a Sept. 18 investor meeting on the planned use of its cash,
which had increased to 2.06 billion euros after the almost full
settlement of the Royal Park sale. Ageas will have returned
about 1.7 billion euros to investors since emerging from the
breakup of Fortis in 2009 following the buybacks and spent about
1 billion euros so far to  expand  its insurance businesses in the
U.K.,  Italy , Turkey and  Asia .  “Given the size of the cash balance, we expect a further
return of capital,”  Albert Ploegh , an analyst at ING Bank NV in
Amsterdam, wrote in a note to clients. “Ageas’s shares continue
to trade at a large  discount  to book and the self-imposed return
hurdle on future investments of at least 11 percent means there
is no straightforward attractive alternative.”  Best Performance  Ageas rose as much as 3 percent on Euronext Brussels and
traded 73 cents higher at 31.08 euros by 9:21 a.m. local time. A
close at this value would be the highest since October 2009. The
stock has more than doubled in the past 12 months, the  best
performance  among the 35 companies in the Stoxx Insurance Index.  The operating margin on contracts with guaranteed return in
Ageas’s life businesses improved to 0.93 percent in the second
quarter from 0.68 percent in the preceding three-month period.
The gain was driven by dividend income in  Belgium  as AG
Insurance SA increased its investments in equities.  The combined ratio in the property and casualty business
improved to 96.1 percent from 99.5 percent in the preceding
quarter on a seasonal drop in claims, offsetting higher expenses
in both Belgium and the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
