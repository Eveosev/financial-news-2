Fingerprint Cards AB (FINGB) , a Swedish maker
of biometric security solutions, fell the most in almost four
months in Stockholm trading after the company cut this year’s
sales forecast due to project delays.  The  shares fell  as much as 18 percent, to 35.60 kronor,
their steepest intraday decline since April 8 and the lowest
price since June 3. The stock fell 4.6 percent as of 10:02 a.m.
local time, valuing the company at 2.1 billion kronor ($314
million). So far this year, the shares have gained 243 percent.  Fingerprint Cards now anticipates sales of between 80
million kronor and 110 million kronor this year, down from a
previous forecast of between 130 million kronor and 190 million
kronor, the Gothenburg-based company said in a statement today.
The lower sales in combination with higher costs related to an
accelerated recruitment of new employees, will lead to a net
loss for the full year, it said.  “There are two main reasons for the change in the sales
forecast,” it said. “One is the delay of a couple of major
projects involving FPC’s swipe-sensor technology, from the
latter half of 2013 to the first half of 2014. The other is that
several of FPC’s OEM customers have chosen to evaluate the area
sensor as an alternative to the swipe sensor, which is delaying
the launch of these projects by six to 12 months.”  Fingerprint Cards said that the “conditions for achieving
healthy profitability in 2014 are excellent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
