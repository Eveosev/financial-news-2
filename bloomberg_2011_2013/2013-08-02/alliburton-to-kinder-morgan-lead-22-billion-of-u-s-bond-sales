Corporate bond sales in the U.S.
dropped 42 percent this week to about $22 billion, with issuance
falling below this year’s average.  Halliburton Co. (HAL) , the world’s largest provider of hydraulic-fracturing services, raised $3 billion to fund share buybacks
and Houston-based  Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP (KMP)  issued $1.75
billion of debt, leading the slowest week since the period ended
July 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales compare
with $37.9 billion last week and a 2013 weekly average of $29.7
billion.  Offerings declined even as the extra yield investors demand
to own corporate bonds rather than government debentures fell to
218 basis points yesterday from 220 basis points on July 26,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate &
High Yield Index. Yields increased to 4.108 percent from 3.996
percent, and compare with a record low 3.35 percent on May 2.  The largest portion of Halliburton’s four-part bond sale
was for $1.1 billion of 3.5 percent, 10-year notes that priced
to yield 93 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
Bloomberg data show. Those securities traded yesterday at 98.8
cents on the dollar to yield 3.64 percent, according to Trace,
the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  Investment Grade  Proceeds will be used to repurchase shares of common stock
under a tender offer and for general corporate purposes,
according to a company  filing .  The largest portion from  Kinder Morgan ’s three-part issue
was for $800 million of 2.65 percent securities due February
2019 with a 130 basis-point spread, Bloomberg data show. The
debt traded yesterday at 99.9 cents on the dollar to yield 2.68
percent, according to Trace.  Sales of investment-grade debentures fell to about $15.1
billion from $31.4 billion last week, and offerings of
speculative-grade bonds rose to $7.1 billion from $6.5 billion,
Bloomberg data show.  High-yield, high-risk bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at  Standard & Poor’s .  Issuers planning sales include  BMC Software Inc. (BMC)  with $1.38
billion of eight-year notes denominated in dollars and euros to
help fund its purchase by a group led by Bain Capital LLC and
Golden Gate Capital, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
