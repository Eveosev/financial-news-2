Nike (NKE)  Inc. severed its endorsement
contract with former National League Most Valuable Player  Ryan Braun , who on July 22 was suspended by Major League Baseball for
the remainder of the season due to drug violations, company
spokesman KeJuan Wilkins said in an e-mail.  Braun, a five-time All-Star outfielder for the Milwaukee
Brewers, didn’t contest the penalty. Wilkins said the world’s
largest sporting-goods maker wouldn’t have any further comment
on Braun.  The 29-year-old was among nearly two dozen major leaguers,
including Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees, being
investigated for connections to a Miami-area anti-aging clinic
that MLB has accused of distributing performance-enhancing drugs
to players.  Braun isn’t the first athlete to be let go by Nike, which
released seven-time Tour de France winner  Lance Armstrong  in the
wake of his admission to using performance-enhancing drugs.  Braun repeatedly denied using drugs after failing a test
during the 2011 postseason. His 50-game doping suspension for
elevated testosterone levels was overturned by an arbitration
panel after he argued his urine test sample had been mishandled.  “I realize now that I have made some mistakes,” Braun
said in a statement after the suspension. “I am willing to
accept the consequences of those actions.”  Nike, based in Beaverton, Oregon, also cut ties with
Philadelphia Eagles quarterback  Michael Vick  after he went to
jail for his role in a dogfighting ring. The company re-signed
Vick when he returned to the National Football League.  To contact the reporter on this story:
