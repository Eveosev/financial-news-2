Direct Line Insurance Group Plc (DLG) , the
U.K.’s biggest home and motor insurer, reported a 28 percent
increase in first-half profit as lower claims from major weather
events helped mitigate a drop in investment returns.  Operating profit climbed to 286.6 million pounds ($433.3
million) in the six months ended June 30 from 224.2 million
pounds in the same period a year earlier, the Bromley, England-based company said today in a statement. That beat the 254.5
million-pound average estimate of four analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Return from investments fell 33 percent to 97.5
million pounds.  “The group has made good progress across each of its
strategic priorities and has delivered an improvement in
operating performance,” the company said in the statement.
“The group has continued to prioritise underwriting margin over
volume growth, whilst reflecting positive claims trends within
pricing where appropriate.”  Direct Line, which was split off from Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc last year, raised its first-half dividend by
5 percent to 4.2 pence. It said it’s “on track” to meet its
combined operating ratio target of 98 percent for the full year
after adjusting for claims from major weather events.  The final dividend should be at a “similar level” to the
first-half payout if current trends continue, the company said.  Direct Line, which is still 49 percent owned by RBS,  rose 
1.1 percent to 232 pence at 8:04 a.m. in London trading. The
shares have risen 7.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
