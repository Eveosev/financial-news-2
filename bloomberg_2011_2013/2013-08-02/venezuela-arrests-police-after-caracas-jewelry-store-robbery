Nine police officers were arrested
for stealing physical evidence after two jewelry stores were
robbed in Caracas on July 30,  Venezuela â€™s public prosecutor
office said today in an e-mailed statement.  The officers were part of a team from the Chacao
municipality that responded to an armed robbery of two jewelry
stores in the Centro Lido office complex and shopping mall in
the eastern Caracas business district of El Rosal, according to
the statement.  Two men connected to the robbery have also been detained,
while a third was killed in a shootout with police, according to
the public prosecutor. Armed robbers entered the building on the
evening of July 30 and waited for the mall to close, the public
prosecutor office said, adding that eight people in the mall,
including six foreigners, were also assaulted.  Venezuela, which faces high rates of violent crime
including kidnapping and murder, was ranked the ninth worst in
the world by  Transparency International  in its 2012 Corruption
Perceptions index. Police forces are perceived as the most
corrupt institution in the country, the organization said in its
2013 Corruption Barometer report.  Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro has made the fight
against corruption a central theme of his platform during the
first 100 days of his government, state news agency AVN  reported 
on July 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
