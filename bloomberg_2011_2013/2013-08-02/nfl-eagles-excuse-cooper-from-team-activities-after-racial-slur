The Philadelphia Eagles excused Riley Cooper from team activities while the wide receiver seeks
counseling after being caught on video using a racial slur.  Cooper said in a statement sent by the National Football
League team that his actions were inexcusable and he intends to
“step away for a period of time” to seek professional help.  “The more I think about what I did, the more disgusted I
get,” Cooper said in the statement. “I keep trying to figure
out how I could have said something so repulsive, and what I can
do to make things better.”  The Eagles fined Cooper an undisclosed amount this week
after a video of him using the slur at a Kenny Chesney concert
last month circulated on the Internet. The team gave no
timetable today for his return.  “Riley Cooper will be seeking counseling and we have
excused him from all team activities,” the Eagles said in the
statement. “He will meet with professionals provided by the
Eagles during this period of time to better help him understand
how his words have hurt so many, including his teammates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
