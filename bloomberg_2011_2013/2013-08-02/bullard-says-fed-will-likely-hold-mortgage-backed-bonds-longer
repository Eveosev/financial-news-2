Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
President  James Bullard , who backed this week’s Fed decision to
continue bond buying, said the Fed will probably hold mortgage-backed securities among its assets longer than it had expected.  “We are more inclined to hold these longer than we were
previously,” Bullard said today in response to an audience
question after a speech in  Boston . “We will probably hold
mortgage-backed longer” and “a couple years in the future make
a decision on what to do.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
