Natural gas declined for the second
straight week in New York, wiping out a 2013 gain, as a mild
start to August limited demand from  power plants .  Gas futures fell 1.2 percent after forecasts showed below-normal temperatures from the East Coast to the Great Plains from
Aug. 7 through Aug. 12, according to MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland . Prices have tumbled 25 percent from a
21-month high on May 1 as U.S. inventory increases exceeded
five-year averages in seven of the past nine weeks.  “Natural gas is a wildly weather-dependent commodity,”
said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics LLC in
Austin,  Texas . “Unless there is a hurricane or a massive
temperature spike in the next couple of weeks, the price could
remain under pressure.”  Natural gas for September delivery slid 4 cents to $3.347
per million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest settlement price since Feb. 22. Volume was
45 percent below the 100-day average at 2:57 p.m. The futures
have fallen 0.1 percent this year after climbing to $4.444 on
May 1, which was a 33 percent increase for 2013. Gas declined
5.9 percent this week, the biggest drop since May.  The discount of September to October futures was steady 2.8
cents.  September $3.35 puts were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were up 1.6 cents at 11 cents per
million Btu on volume of 871 at 3:35 p.m. Puts accounted for 58
percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for at-the-money
options expiring in September was 30.88 percent at 3:15 p.m.,
compared with 31.09 percent yesterday.  Washington High  The high temperature in  Washington  on Aug. 5 may be 80
degrees Fahrenheit (27 Celsius), 8 below normal, and  Chicago ’s
reading may be 4 lower than the average at 79 degrees, according
to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  Electricity generators, the largest consumers of U.S. gas,
will account for 32 percent of demand this year, data show from
the Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm.  U.S. stockpiles  expanded by 59 billion cubic feet to 2.845
trillion cubic feet in the week ended July 26, above the five-year average injection of 47 billion for the period, the EIA
said yesterday.  Narrower Deficit  A  deficit  to five-year average supplies narrowed to 1.2
percent from 1.6 percent the previous week, EIA data show.  U.S. marketed gas production, which doesn’t include amounts
flared or used to pressure wells, will increase 1.1 percent to a
record 69.96 billion cubic feet a day in 2013, according to the
EIA’s July 9 Short-Term Energy Outlook.  The  gas-rig count  rose by 19 to 388 as of today from the
previous week, the most since March 29, according to Baker
Hughes Inc. in Houston. The total is down 10 percent this year.  “Frenetic drilling activity has created a significant
inventory of unconnected wells,” Teri Viswanath, director of
commodities strategy at BNP Paribas SA in  New York , said on a
call with clients today. “That’s why we think production will
remain stable” even with the drop in dry-gas drilling this
year, she said.  The U.S. met 87 percent of its own energy needs in the
first four months of 2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1985, EIA data show. Drilling technologies such as
hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, have made it more economical
to extract gas trapped in shale rock, such as the Marcellus
deposit in the Northeast.  Relative Strength  Gas futures are on the verge of entering into an
“oversold” territory, based on the relative strength index, or
RSI, said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho
Securities USA Inc. in New York. The RSI for the front-month
contract was 32.14 at 3 p.m. A drop below 30 is considered by
some traders to be a buy signal, and a number above 70 can be an
indication to sell futures.  While a weakening in the RSI may trigger a short-term price
bounce, Yawger said the selloff to get there could trigger an
even more significant breakdown in technical trading.  The 50-day moving average, which started sloping downward
in June, is poised to cross below the 200-day moving average in
three to four days, he said.  “That’s just not a good situation” and may push prices
down to the next support area of $3.10 to $3.15, Yawger said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
