  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  is acquiring Passif
Semiconductor Corp., a developer of communications chips that
require less power for devices to exchange information with each
other.  Apple confirmed the deal. “Apple buys smaller technology
companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our
purpose or plans,” said Amy Bessette, a spokeswoman for the
Cupertino, California-based company.  Passif joins a group of small chip companies that have been
snapped up by Apple in recent years, including the 2008
acquisition of P.A. Semi Inc., a designer of low-power
processors that deliver more computing power per watt of
electricity. More efficient energy usage is critical for mobile
products such as the iPhone and iPad, as well as an anticipated
product category of wearable computers. Apple has a team of more
than 100 working on a wristwatch-like device, people familiar
with the company’s plans said in February.  Apple also bought another chip designer, Intrinsity, in
2010, gaining technology to speed up computing tasks. Apple is
also exploring ways to replace  Intel Corp. (INTC)  processors in its Mac
personal computers with a version of the chip technology it uses
in the iPhone and iPad, people familiar with the company’s
research have said.  Semiconductor development was part of Apple’s management
overhaul announced in October. In the statement announcing
leadership changes, Apple said its semiconductor teams have
“ambitious plans for the future.”  Apple’s acquisition was earlier reported by Jessica Lessin,
a former Wall Street Journal reporter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
