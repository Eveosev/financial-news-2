South African corn futures declined
the most in a week, tracking prices that fell in the U.S., the
world’s largest producer of the grain, due to good weather.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, fell 0.7 percent to 2,361 rand ($236) a metric ton,
the most since July 26. The yellow variety for September,
declined 0.2 percent to 2,156 rand a ton. Corn for delivery in
December fell 0.3 percent to $4.6575 a bushel in  Chicago  after
yesterday touching $4.64, the lowest level for a most-active
contract since October 2010.  Rainfall in the next 10 days will be above normal in parts
of Nebraska, Kansas and  Missouri , Commodity Weather Group said
in a report today. Cool weather also will prevent heat stress on
plants, forecaster DTN said. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said July 11 that farmers will boost output by 29 percent this
year to a record 13.95 billion bushels.  “The downward movement in America caused by reports on
good weather, made our prices come down,” Thys Grobbelaar, an
analyst at Klerksdorp, South Africa-based Senwes Ltd., said by
phone.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
Yellow corn is used mainly as  animal feed  in the country, while
a meal made from the white variety is one of South Africa’s
staple foods.  Wheat for delivery in December rose 1.5 percent to 3,379
rand a ton, the fifth consecutive advance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
