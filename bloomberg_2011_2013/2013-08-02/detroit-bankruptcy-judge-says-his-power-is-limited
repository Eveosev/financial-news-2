The judge overseeing  Detroit ’s record
$18 billion municipal bankruptcy said his power in the case is
limited, and a lawyer for the city said there are still
“significant differences” in negotiations with creditors.  “The court has no role in managing or running the city or
managing any of the services it supplies,” U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Steven Rhodes said at the start of a hearing today in
Detroit. “There is nothing the court can do in those matters.”  He said nothing in the law governing municipal bankruptcies
gives the court authority to hire, fire or hold accountable city
officials.  Detroit sought court protection on July 18 after decades of
decline left the traditional home of U.S. automakers unable to
pay its debts or provide needed services, including keeping
streetlights functioning and improving police and firefighter
response times.  Kevyn Orr, the city’s emergency manager, has proposed a
restructuring plan that would help the city pay for services in
part by cutting public pensions and payments to some
bondholders. David Heiman, an attorney for the city, told the
judge that talks with creditors will continue today and next
week.  “It’s clear that there are significant differences between
the city and its unsecured creditors,” said Heiman, a partner
at  Jones Day . “Those differences are not surprising, given the
limited resources of the city.”  The case is City of Detroit, 13-bk-53846,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Eastern District of  Michigan  (Detroit).  To contact the reporter on this story:
