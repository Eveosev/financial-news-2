American Airlines’ request for court
approval of a $20 million severance for Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Tom Horton was opposed by the U.S.
government’s bankruptcy watchdog.  The compensation, which would be paid half in cash and half
in stock, is prohibited by bankruptcy law, the U.S. Trustee’s
office said in a court filing today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
 Manhattan .  Horton’s severance would be paid as part of American parent
 AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) ’s exit from bankruptcy protection by merging with  US
Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  to create the world’s largest airline. The
U.S. previously objected to the severance agreement when the
bankruptcy court approved the merger in March.  Mike Trevino, a spokesman for Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR,
said the agreement with Horton “is not in any way prohibited by
the terms and provisions of the bankruptcy code.”  “Furthermore, AMR’s creditors and shareholders have voted
overwhelmingly to accept the plan, which includes the chairman
letter agreement,” he said in an e-mailed statement.  The case is In re AMR Corp., 11-15463, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
