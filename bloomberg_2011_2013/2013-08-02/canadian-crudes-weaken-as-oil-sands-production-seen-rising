Canadian crude oils weakened on the
 spot market  after the country’s largest producer said output was
rising, increasing supplies.  “I expect that when we post our oil-sands production in a
day or two, you’ll see a monthly record of approximately 390,000
barrels a day,”  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  Chief Executive  Steve Williams  said on the company’s second-quarter conference call
yesterday. That level would be up 33 percent from 293,000
barrels in  June .  Western Canadian Select oil for September delivery weakened
by $1.50 a barrel to a $21.60 discount to U.S. benchmark West
Texas Intermediate, according to Calgary oil broker Net Energy
Inc. Light Syncrude weakened by 40 cents to a $2.10-per-barrel
premium to WTI.  Canadian grades gave up gains of $1.25 a barrel for WCS and
75 cents for Syncrude as Suncor said in its earnings release
that Unit 2 of its upgrader in Fort McMurray,  Alberta , would be
shut for maintenance for about three weeks during the third
quarter. Production will be reduced by 50,000 to 60,0000 barrels
a day during the work, Williams said, compared with the plant’s
normal 350,000-barrel capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
