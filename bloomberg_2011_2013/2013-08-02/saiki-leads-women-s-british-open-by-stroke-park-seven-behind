Inbee Park is eight shots off the
lead heading into today’s third round of the Women’s  British
Open  as she seeks to become the only golfer to win four major
professional championships in a calendar year.  Park shot a 1-over-par 73 yesterday on the Old Course at
St. Andrews, Scotland, and is 2 under for the tournament. Fellow
South Korean Na-Yeon Choi leads at 10 under after her second
consecutive 67, with Japan’s Miki Saiki a stroke back after
shooting the low score of the day with a 66.  Morgan Pressel of the U.S., who started the day tied for
the lead, had a second-round 70 and is two strokes behind Choi.  Park, who is tied for 22nd place, is bidding for her fourth
major title of 2013 after winning her second U.S. Women’s Open
last month. She also captured the LPGA Championship in June and
the Kraft Nabisco Championship in April. The LPGA is adding the
Evian Masters in September as a fifth major this year.  Babe Zaharias was the last woman to win the first three
majors in a season in 1950, five years before a fourth Grand
Slam tournament was added. Pat Bradley in 1986 was the last
woman to win three major titles in a year.  Tiger Woods  held all four men’s major titles at the same
time by winning the  U.S. Open , British Open and  PGA Championship 
in 2000 and adding the  Masters Tournament  the following year.
 Bobby Jones  is the only golfer to win four majors in one
calendar year, taking the U.S. and British opens and U.S. and
British amateur championships in 1930.  To contact the reporter on this story:
