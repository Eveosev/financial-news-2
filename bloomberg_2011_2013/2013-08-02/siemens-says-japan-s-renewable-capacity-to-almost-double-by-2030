Siemens AG (SIE) ,  Europe ’s biggest
engineering company, expects  Japan  to almost double its capacity
of renewable energy by 2030, while continuing with nuclear power
generation even after the Fukushima disaster.  Renewable energy may account for 35 percent of capacity in
2030, compared with 19 percent in 2011, Kenichi Fujita, senior
executive operating officer at Siemens Japan K.K., told
reporters in Tokyo today. Wind power may provide more than half
of the renewable capacity, he said.  Japan started offering above-market prices for renewables
in July 2012 to spur investment in clean energy after the
meltdowns at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant in March 2011
shattered public confidence in nuclear power. Japanese Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe, who took office in December, promised to
review the previous administration’s targets for phasing out
nuclear power by the end of the 2030s and expanding renewables.  The share of nuclear power in Japan’s energy mix will fall
to 15 percent by 2030, from 20 percent in 2011, Fujita said. It
will probably continue to wane in the long run because the
country plans to cap the lifespans of reactors at 40 years, he
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
