SM Investments Corp., the holding
company of Philippine billionaire  Henry Sy , slid the most in six
weeks in Manila equity trading after it sold $150 million worth
of shares at a discount.  SM Investments shares fell 5.4 percent to 910 pesos at
10:56 a.m. local time, heading for the sharpest loss since June
20. The stock was the biggest contributor to a loss in the
 Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PCOMP) , which fell 0.4 percent.  The Manila-based company sold 7.25 million shares to
institutional investors at a placement price of 900 pesos each,
according to a term sheet. That’s a 10 percent discount to
yesterday’s closing price.  “The weakness in the share price is a reflection of the
discount and the expanded float in relation to the share sale,”
said Astro del Castillo, managing director at First Grade
Finance Inc. in Manila.  SM Investments said it sold more shares than planned
because of “strong demand.” The company initially sought to
raise $100 million, according to a term sheet obtained by
Bloomberg yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
