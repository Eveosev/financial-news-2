Polish bond yields fell, wiping out
earlier gains, after worse-than-expected U.S. jobs data eased
expectations for an early tapering of the  Federal Reserve ’s
stimulus program that boosted flows into riskier assets.  Yields on 10-year government debt slipped two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.17 percent by 4:15 p.m. in
Warsaw, after rising as much as 13 basis points before the
release of U.S. non-farm payrolls. The move pared the increase
in yields in the past five days to 18 basis points, the most in
six weeks. The zloty gained 0.7 percent to 4.2318 against the
euro, bringing its return this week to less than 0.1 percent,
the best performance among Europe’s emerging-market currencies
monitored by Bloomberg.  The payrolls increased by 162,000 last month, the smallest
gain in four months following a revised 188,000 advance in June
that was less than initially estimated, Labor Department figures
showed today in  Washington . The median forecast of 93 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was 185,000.  “Market expectations were deeply overblown” by better-than-expected data from the U.S. labor market from the previous
two days, Jakub Taborowicz, who helps manage 17 billion zloty
($5.3 billion) in debt securities at PZU TFI SA in Warsaw, said
by e-mail today. The payroll data “damps expectations for the
first round of tapering in September,” he said.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said June 19 the central bank
may reduce its monthly purchases of $85 billion in debt this
year and phase them out by the middle of 2014. The monetary
stimulus and near-zero borrowing costs have driven investors
toward higher-yielding bonds in  emerging markets , including
 Poland .  Poland’s  Finance Ministry  will announce on Aug. 5 whether
it will hold a local currency bond auction two days later. The
country has met 91 percent of its borrowing needs by the end of
July, the ministry said in a press statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
