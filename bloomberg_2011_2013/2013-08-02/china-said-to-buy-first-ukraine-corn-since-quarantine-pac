China ’s state-owned COFCO Corp.
bought 120,000 metric tons of corn from Ukraine, the first
transaction since the countries signed a quarantine pact in
November, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said.  The two cargoes will be delivered in October and November,
said the people, who asked not to be identified as the deal is
private. The grain was resold to feed mills in southern China,
they said. Yin Jianhao, spokesman at Beijing-based COFCO, didn’t
answer two calls to his mobile phone.  The clearance of the shipment paves the way for more
imports from Ukraine and increases competition with the U.S.,
the biggest supplier, and Argentina. China’s quarantine
authorities last week approved the first shipment from  Argentina 
under a sanitary agreement signed in February 2012, according to
three people with direct knowledge of the deal.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: William Bi in
