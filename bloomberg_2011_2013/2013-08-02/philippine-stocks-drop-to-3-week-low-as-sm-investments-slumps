Philippine stocks fell, driving the
benchmark index to a three-week low, as  SM Investments Corp. (SM) 
tumbled the most in almost five years and the nation’s biggest
money manager said shares are poised to decline.  SM Investments, the country’s biggest company by market
value, sank 8.6 percent after selling shares at a discount, the
sharpest loss since Oct. 27, 2008. The Philippine Stock Exchange
Index declined 1.9 percent to 6,533.95, the lowest since July
11. The measure lost 3.4 percent this week, the first decline in
six weeks, and trades at 18 times projected 12-month earnings,
compared with the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s 10 times.  Philippine stocks are echoing a pattern from 2007 that
signals the benchmark gauge is heading for a slump,  Jonathan Ravelas , chief market strategist at BDO Unibank Inc., which has
about $20 billion in assets under management, said in an
interview.  “The decline has turned broad-based, and this is not only
just due to SM Investments,” Astro del Castillo, managing
director at First Grade Finance Inc., said by phone today.
“Investors turned cautious on concern the market will repeat
the trend that transpired in 2007. The market’s bias is
downwards, as share valuations are expensive.”  The  Philippine index  has advanced 12 percent this year,
reaching a record on May 15. That’s mirroring a rally in 2007,
when the gauge peaked in October of that year before tumbling
about 23 percent in six months amid the global financial crisis,
according to Ravelas.  ‘History Repeating’  “We could be seeing history repeating itself,” Ravelas
said. The stock measure may drop 17 percent in the next six
months and the Philippine peso may weaken about 3 percent
against the U.S. currency as the  Federal Reserve  moves closer to
paring monetary stimulus and  interest rates  rise, he said.  The peso weakened for a fifth day, losing 0.1 percent
against the dollar to the lowest level since July 9.  The benchmark stock index’s  valuation  is the highest among
emerging and developed markets after the measure surged 138
percent during the four years through yesterday. That’s the
biggest rally among 45 equity gauges tracked by Bloomberg.  SM Investments, owner of the nation’s biggest shopping mall
operator, sank to 879 pesos. SM Prime Holdings Inc., the largest
mall operator, declined 5.6 percent to 16.62 pesos, the sharpest
loss since June 13.  Manila-based SM Investments sold 7.25 million shares to
institutional investors at 900 pesos each, according to a term
sheet. The stock closed at 961.50 pesos yesterday.  Philippine Long Distance (TEL) , the largest company by weight on
the nation’s benchmark index, rose 1.2 percent to 3,074 pesos.
The company will meet its 2013 core profit guidance, Chairman
 Manuel Pangilinan  wrote in a text message today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
