Russia , the world’s biggest oil
producer, increased crude and condensate  production  by 1 percent
in July from a year earlier to 10.43 million barrels a day, near
a post-Soviet record.  Daily output fell 0.7 percent from June, when it set the
record, according to preliminary data sent by e-mail today from
the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit in Moscow. Soviet-era
production in Russia peaked at 11.48 million barrels in 1987.  President  Vladimir Putin  is promoting tax relief for
offshore and low-permeability resources to keep production at
more than 10 million barrels a day as Soviet-era Siberian
deposits decline. He signed off on tax breaks last month for
less accessible resources that could be applied to so-called
tight  oil deposits  starting in September. The oil and natural
gas industry contribute half of the nation’s revenue.  Crude and condensate exports fell 1.7 percent to 4.97
million barrels a day in July from the previous month. Shipments
from Primorsk, Russia’s largest oil port, will be less than 1
million barrels a day for the third month in August and the
lowest since at least 2008.  Natural gas output rose 3.9 percent last month from a year
earlier to 1.5 billion cubic meters a day, the data show.
Gazprom, Russia’s gas export monopoly, boosted production 1
percent to 1.03 billion cubic meters. Shipments to  Europe  and
 Turkey  rose 29 percent to 14 billion, Gazprom said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
