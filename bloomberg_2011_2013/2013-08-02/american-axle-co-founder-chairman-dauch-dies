American Axle & Manufacturing
Holdings Inc. (AXL) ’s co-founder and chairman, Richard Dauch, has
died, the company said, without disclosing the cause. He was 71.  Dauch died yesterday, Danielle Landolt, a company
spokeswoman, said in an interview.  The executive led an investment group that acquired a
division of the predecessor of  General Motors Co. (GM)  in 1994 and
led it to an initial public offering in 1999. Dauch was chief
executive officer until 2012, when he yielded the post to his
son, David Dauch.  American Axle has been trying to diversify its customer
base beyond GM while strengthening its balance sheet. The
company’s shares have gained 87 percent this year to $20.94.
Detroit-based American Axle yesterday reported its second-quarter net income rose more than fivefold to $25.8 million
from a year earlier.  Dauch began his auto career in 1964 when he joined GM,
according to his American Axle biography. He worked as a
manufacturing executive at  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s U.S. unit and
Chrysler Corp. before co-founding the supplier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
