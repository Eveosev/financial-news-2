with an increase of 0.1 percent in May.  The PCE price index,
excluding food and energy, increased 0.2 percent, compared with
an increase of 0.1 percent.  NOTE.  BEA acknowledges the special efforts by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics with the assistance of 18 state employment
offices in providing preliminary data for the first quarter of
2013 from the quarterly census of employment and wages (QCEW).
Wage and salary data from the state employment offices of
California,  Colorado ,  Connecticut ,  Delaware ,  Florida ,  Georgia ,
 Illinois ,  Kansas ,  Maryland ,  Massachusetts ,  Missouri , New Jersey,
New York,  North Carolina ,  Ohio ,  Pennsylvania , Texas, and  Utah 
were provided.  These data have greatly improved the estimates
of wages and salaries.  Revision of the Personal Income and Outlay Estimates  The statistics released today reflect the results of the 14th
comprehensive (or benchmark) revision of the national income and
product accounts (NIPAs).  Comprehensive revisions incorporate
several improvements, including changes in definitions and
classifications that update the accounts to more accurately
portray the evolving U.S. economy, changes in presentation that
make the NIPA tables more informative and easier to use, and
statistical changes that introduce new and improved
methodologies and that bring in newly available and revised
source data.  For this comprehensive revision, personal outlays, DPI, and
personal saving are revised from 1929 through May of 2013.  The revisions to personal income and outlays, for 2010-2012, are
shown in table 12.  Revised and previously published monthly
estimates of personal income, DPI, PCE, personal saving as a
percentage of DPI, real DPI, and real PCE are shown in table 13;
revised and previously published annual and quarterly estimates
are shown in table 14.  Personal income was revised up for 1929-2007, down for 2008, and
up for 2009-2012.  These revisions mainly reflect  the accrual approach for measuring defined benefit pension plans,
which results in upward revisions to personal income receipts on
assets for 1929・012 and in upward revisions to supplements
(specifically, employer contributions for employee pension and
insurance funds) for 1929-1975, for 1989-2002, and for 2004-2011.
A number of other definitional and statistical changes affected
the revisions to personal income.  The revisions to the
components of personal income are discussed below.  The revisions to wages and salaries mainly reflect revisions to
private wages and salaries.  The revisions are generally small
and mixed for years prior to 2002, are downward for 2002-2011,
and are upward for 2012.  The revisions reflect revised
estimates of misreporting and new and revised BLS QCEW data.  The revisions to supplements reflect the revisions to employer
contributions for pension and insurance funds that result from
the accrual approach for measuring defined benefit pension plans.
Employer contributions for state and local government defined
benefit plans was revised up for 1929-1978, down for 1979-1986,
and up for 1987-2012. Employer contributions for federal
government defined benefit plans was revised up for 1929-1979
and down for 1980-2012. Employer contributions for private
defined benefit plans was revised down for 1968-1985, up for
1986-2001, down for 2002-2006, up for 2007, and down for 2008-2012.  Contributions for state and local government defined
contribution pension plans was revised up for 1967-2012,
reflecting the incorporation of improved source data.  Proprietors・income was revised down for 1965-2011 and up for
2012; the revisions for years before 1965 are small. Nonfarm
proprietors・income was revised down for 1965-2011 and up for
2012.  The revisions to proprietors・income primarily reflect
revisions to nonfarm proprietors・income for most years (except
for 2009 and for 2012). Farm proprietors・income had relatively
large upward revisions for 2011 and 2012, reflecting the
incorporation of revised USDA data for 2010-2012.  The revisions to nonfarm proprietors・income reflect a number of
definitional and statistical changes as well as revised source
data.  Revisions due to the improved accounting for the  capital
gains  and losses attributable to corporate partners are downward
for 2002-2008, upward for 2009, and downward for 2010-2012.
Revisions due to the capitalization of expenditures for the
creation of entertainment, literary, and artistic originals and
for an expanded set of ownership transfer costs are downward,
while the revisions due to the capitalization of R&D
expenditures are upward. The revisions also reflect new  Internal
Revenue Service  (IRS) estimates for underreporting of income as
well as new IRS tabulations of tax return data for sole
proprietorships and partnerships for 2011.  Rental income of persons was revised down for 1929-2002 and was
revised up for 2003 forward.  The improved methodology for
estimating mortgage interest paid for nonfarm permanent site
housing results in downward revisions to rental income of
persons for 1993-2001 and upward revisions for 2002-2012.  The
recognition of an expanded set of ownership transfer costs for
residential assets as fixed investment results in downward
revisions for all years, partly offsetting the upward revisions
due to the improved estimates of mortgage interest paid in for
2003-2012.  The revisions also reflect revisions to owner- and
tenant-occupied space rent, based on data from the 2010 Census
of Housing and the incorporation of other new and revised source
data.  Personal interest income was revised up for all years except for
2008.  The upward revisions mainly reflect the new accrual
treatment of defined benefit pension plans.  Personal interest
income was also affected by several other changes in methodology,
including an improved method for distributing the investment
income of regulated investment companies by type of income and
the improved method for measuring interest associated with
financial services of commercial banks.  Revisions to personal
interest income also reflect the incorporation of new and
revised source data from the Federal Reserve Board and other
sources.  Personal dividend income was revised up for most years for 1991-2009, was revised down for 2010, was revised up for 2011, and
was revised down for 2012.  The revisions to personal dividend
income reflect the improved method for distributing the
investment income of regulated investment companies by type of
income as well as the incorporation of new and revised IRS
tabulations of corporate tax returns and of data from BEA’s
international transactions accounts on dividends from the rest
of the world.  Personal current transfer receipts was revised down for 2002, up
for 2003-2009, and down for 2010-2012.  The revisions reflect
the incorporation of new and revised source data.  The revisions to contributions for government social insurance
(which is deducted in the calculation of personal income) are
small for 2002-2012.  Personal current taxes was revised up for 2011 and 2012;
revisions are generally small for prior years.  The revisions
reflect the incorporation of new tax collections data from the
Treasury Department and the  Social Security Administration  and
of new and revised Census Bureau state and local government
finances data.  The pattern of revisions to disposable personal income, which is
equal to personal income less personal current taxes, is similar
to that of personal income.  Personal outlays consists of PCE, personal interest payments,
and personal current transfer payments.  The revisions to
personal outlays primarily reflect the revisions to PCE.
Revisions to PCE are generally small before 1985; PCE was
revised up for 1985 and 1986, down for 1987-2011, and up for
2012.  PCE for services accounts for most of the revisions for
all years except for 2011.  Personal interest payments was
revised up for 1985 forward; revisions for prior years are small.
The revisions to personal interest payments result from the
improved method for measuring the financial services of
commercial banks and from the incorporation of new and revised
source data.  Personal current transfer payments was revised
down for 2007-2012.  Personal saving (DPI less personal outlays) was revised up for
1929-2007, down for 2008, and up for 2009-2012.  These revisions
reflect the revisions to DPI and are mainly the result of
adopting the accrual treatment of defined benefit pension plans.
The personal saving rate (personal saving as a percentage of
DPI) was revised up for 1929-2007, down for 2008, and up for
2009-2012, reflecting the revisions to personal saving.  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department.     http://www.bea.gov   To contact the reporter on this story:
