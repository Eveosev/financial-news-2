The ruble strengthened, erasing
earlier losses, and yields on Russian  government bonds  fell
after U.S. jobs data that missed economists’ forecasts.  The ruble gained 0.3 percent to 37.7460 against the dollar-euro basket by 5:15 p.m. in Moscow, paring this week’s retreat
to 0.3 percent. The Russian currency snapped seven days of
losses against the greenback, appreciating 0.5 percent to
32.9200.  “I think the reaction is temporary, and the trend toward
the ruble weakening will prevail,” Dmitry Dorofeev, an analyst
and trader at BCS Financial Group in Moscow, said by e-mail.  The 162,000 increase in payrolls in the U.S. in July was
the smallest in four months and followed a revised 188,000 gain
in June that was less than initially estimated, Labor Department
figures showed in  Washington  today. The median forecast of 93
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 185,000 gain.  Benchmark OFZ bonds due February 2027 gained after the data
were published, erasing earlier losses and pushing down the
yield three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.76
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
