Cattle futures rose for the first
time in four sessions on speculation that milder weather across
the U.S. Midwest will revive beef buying after last month’s heat
wave proved too hot for some consumers to grill outdoors. Hogs
advanced.  Temperatures will be lower than normal for at least the
next several weeks, after a heat wave July 16 through July 19
that was as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit above average,
followed by weather through last week that was hotter than
normal for this time of year, Kyle Tapley, a meteorologist for
MDA Information Systems Inc., said in a telephone interview from
Gaithersburg,  Maryland . Highs will be in the mid-to-upper 70s
Fahrenheit (upper 20s Celsius) for the next two weeks, well
below the average of 83 degrees Fahrenheit.  “Cooler temperatures are making it better weather for
outdoor grilling, so we should see demand increase,”  Rich Nelson , the chief strategist at Allendale Inc. in McHenry,
 Illinois , said in a telephone interview.  Cattle futures for October delivery climbed 0.5 percent to
$1.251 a pound at 11:39 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
after touching $1.241, the lowest for a most-active contract
since July 9. Prices were down 5.9 percent this year through
yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for September settlement gained 0.2
percent to $1.576 a pound.  Hog futures for October settlement advanced 0.3 percent to
84.15 cents a pound on the CME. The commodity declined 2.1
percent this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
