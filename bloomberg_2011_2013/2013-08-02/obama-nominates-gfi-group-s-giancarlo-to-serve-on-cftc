J. Christopher Giancarlo, executive
vice president at interdealer broker  GFI Group Inc. (GFIG) , was
nominated by President  Barack Obama  to serve on the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, according to the White House.  Giancarlo would fill the Republican commissioner post
vacated by Jill E. Sommers, who stepped down last month from the
five-member agency that regulates the  derivatives market . The
Washington-based commission is implementing Dodd-Frank Act
regulations that seek to reduce risk in the swaps market that
helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis.  Giancarlo, whose nomination faces Senate confirmation, has
been an active participant in debates over the new rules. He
stepped down earlier this year as chairman of the Wholesale
Market Brokers’ Association Americas, which includes GFI Group
and four other interdealer brokers, that lobbied for flexible
rules on how swaps are traded using new execution facilities.  Giancarlo also has testified before Congress, met with CFTC
officials and appeared at industry conferences focusing on how
the swaps regulations were being implemented.  If confirmed, Giancarlo would serve the remainder of
Sommers’s term, which expires April 13, 2014, according to a
White House statement yesterday announcing his nomination.  To contact the reporter on this story:
