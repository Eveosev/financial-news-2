CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE) , the biggest U.S.
options market by volume, reported second-quarter profit that
beat analyst projections as trading volumes climbed.  Net income increased 20 percent to $45.5 million, or 52
cents a share, the Chicago-based company said today in a
statement. Earnings excluding some items were 54 cents a share,
exceeding the 51-cent  average analyst estimate , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  CBOE’s earnings growth  slowed  last year after volume fell
for the first time in nine years and competition in the U.S.
listed-options market increased to 11 exchanges. Options trading
has averaged 17 million contracts daily in 2013, up about 7
percent from last year. Derivatives also helped boost second-quarter profit at New York-based NYSE Euronext, which owns two
options exchanges.  The “results were driven by increased trading overall and
our successful efforts to expand trading in our higher-margin
proprietary products,” Edward Tilly, chief executive officer of
CBOE, said in the statement. “Trading volume in VIX Index
futures, which carry our highest fee per contract, reached a new
quarterly record for the sixth consecutive quarter. We will
remain focused on product development, extending our global
customer reach and maintaining prudent fiscal management to
deliver value to stockholders.”  The  stock  rose 4.2 percent to $52.95 at 8:22 a.m. in pre-market New York trading today. CBOE has gained 72 percent in
2013, the third-most among the 27 members of the Bloomberg World
Exchanges Index.  Earnings Growth  CBOE’s earnings expanded 6 percent last year, down from 47
percent in 2011, after options volume slowed to a daily average
of 15.9 million contracts from a ninth-consecutive record of
18.1 million in 2011,  data  from the Chicago-based Options
Clearing Corp. show. The CBOE is the exclusive venue for options
based on the  CBOE Volatility Index (SPX) , also known as the VIX, and
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Operating revenue rose 14 percent to $150.8 million in the
second quarter, driven by a 12 percent gain in transaction fees.  Revenue per contract increased to 33.4 cents from 31.4
cents in the second quarter of 2012, CBOE said. Total trading
for the quarter rose to 317.4 million contracts, or 4.96 million
contracts per day, from 302.7 million contracts, or 4.80 million
contracts per day, a year earlier.  NYSE Euronext, the U.S. exchange operator being bought by
IntercontinentalExchange Inc., said July 30 second-quarter
earnings beat analysts’ estimates, as revenue from derivatives
trading rose and costs fell. Nasdaq OMX Group Inc., owner of two
options exchanges,  reported  on July 24 a decline in quarterly
profit amid costs associated with acquisitions.  CME Profit  CME Group Inc., the world’s largest futures market,
yesterday said second-quarter profit rose 27 percent to $311
million, or 93 cents a share compared with the year-earlier
period as record foreign exchange and metals trading helped
boost volume.  Deutsche Boerse AG, operator of the International
Securities Exchange options market, the Eurex futures exchange
and the Frankfurt bourse, reported second-quarter profit fell
8.2 percent dropped to 171 million euros ($227 million) as
trading volumes declined.  To contact the reporters on this story:
