 The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission sued a former  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) 
employee, claiming he repeatedly obtained quarterly earnings
data and traded in advance of its public release.  Chad McGinnis, who worked as a systems administrator at
Vermont-based Green Mountain, bought the company’s securities --
typically out-of-the-money options –- shortly before earnings
announcements, the SEC said in a statement today. He also tipped
Sergey Pugach, a longtime friend and business associate who was
also accused of illegal trading, the SEC said.  The two men reaped $7 million in illegal profits by using
the inside information from earnings announcements since 2010.  “McGinnis and Pugach exploited confidential company
financial data to conduct their insider trading scheme to the
detriment of Green Mountain Coffee and its shareholders,”
Donald Hoerl, director of the SEC’s Denver office. “The timing
of their trades was consistently and exceptionally successful,
but their scheme ultimately was not.”  The SEC complaint was filed under seal on July 24, when the
court granted a motion seeking a temporary restraining order and
an asset freeze, the agency said. A hearing is set for Aug. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
