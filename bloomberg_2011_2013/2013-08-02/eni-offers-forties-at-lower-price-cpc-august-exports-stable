(Corrects Tupras seeking Basrah Light in 11th paragraph.)  Eni SpA (ENI)  failed to sell North Sea
Forties crude even after lowering its offer. No bids or offers
were made for Russian Urals for a third day.  BP Plc (BP/)  didn’t
manage to buy Azeri Light blend for a second day.  The Caspian Pipeline Consortium, operator of the only oil-export link in  Russia  that has shared foreign ownership, will
keep daily August crude exports from the Black Sea little
changed from July, a final loading program obtained by Bloomberg
News showed.  North Sea  Eni was unable to sell Forties for loading on Aug. 21 to
Aug. 23 at a premium of $1.10 a barrel to Dated Brent, 10 cents
less than its offer yesterday, a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window showed.  Vitol Group didn’t manage to buy Forties for Aug. 23 to
Aug. 28 at 85 cents more than Dated Brent, the survey showed.  No bids or offers were made for Brent, Oseberg and Ekofisk.
Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time.  Brent for September settlement traded at $108.84 a barrel
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $109.09 in the previous session. The October
contract was at $108.00, a discount of 84 cents to September.  Mediterranean/Urals  BP failed to buy Azeri Light crude for loading on Aug. 12
to Aug. 23 at $3.95 a barrel more than Dated Brent, unchanged
from yesterday, which was the highest bid in at least three
years, the survey showed.  CPC will ship 2.87 million metric tons this month, compared
with 2.89 million tons in July, according to the schedule.
That’s equal to 719,226 barrels a day, compared with 724,490
barrels this month, the most since November 2010.  The program comprises eight cargoes of 134,000 to 135,500
tons each and 21 consignments of 85,000 to 93,500 tons,
according to the document.  The volume in the final program is more than the 2.611
million tons, or 654,435 barrels a day, scheduled in the
preliminary plan released on July 12.  Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri AS (TUPRS)  is seeking to buy
140,000 tons of Basrah Light crude for Sept. 10 to Sept. 20
delivery via a tender, according to two people with knowledge of
matter, asking not to be identified because information is
confidential. The tender closes Aug. 5.  West Africa  Indian Oil Corp. issued its first tender to buy crude for
loading in October, according to a document obtained by
Bloomberg News. Part I of the tender closes at 10 p.m. local
time Aug. 5, and part II closes at 3 p.m. Aug. 6, with offers
