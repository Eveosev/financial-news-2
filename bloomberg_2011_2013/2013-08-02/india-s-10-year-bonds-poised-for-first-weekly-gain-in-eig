India’s 10-year bonds headed for
their first weekly advance in eight on speculation a surge in
yields last month attracted buyers.  The yield on the notes due 2023 increased 75 basis points
in July, the most since March 2009. The  Federal Reserve  pledged
this week to continue its $85 billion a month debt-buying
program that has boosted fund flows to  emerging markets . The
 Reserve Bank  of India raised two  interest rates  and tightened
cash supply last month to arrest a slide in the rupee, which
fell to a record low on July 8.  The yield on the 7.16 percent government bonds due May 2023
fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, this week to
8.11 percent as of 10 a.m. in Mumbai, according to prices from
the central bank’s trading system. The yield rose two basis
points today and reached 8.42 percent on July 24, the highest
level for a benchmark 10-year note in 14 months.  “It’s a good entry point for investors,” said N.S. Venkatesh, head of treasury at  IDBI Bank Ltd. (IDBI)  in Mumbai.
“Yields should soften a bit from here once the exchange rate
stabilizes as the longer-term story is that interest rates have
to come down to support economic growth.”  RBI GovernorDuvvuri Subbarao held the repurchase rate at
7.25 percent on July 30, while the central bank reduced its
 expansion forecast  for the year ending March 2014 to 5.5 percent
from 5.7 percent.  Primary dealers underwrote 121 billion rupees ($2 billion)
of the 150 billion rupees of government bonds to be offered
today, the RBI said in a statement yesterday.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose two basis
points this week and dropped four basis points today to 9.34
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
