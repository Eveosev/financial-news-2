The Boston  Red Sox  scored six runs in
the ninth inning to secure an 8-7 victory over the  Seattle
Mariners .  “We don’t quit, ever,” Red Sox manager John Farrell told
reporters last night. “We truly believe we have a chance to do
something special on a given night or given year. And that
happens to be this year.”  The Red Sox (66-44) opened a one-game lead over the idle
Tampa Bay Rays atop Major League Baseball’s American League East.  Henry Blanco hit a grand slam in the fifth inning to give
the Mariners a 7-1 lead at Fenway Park in Boston.  The Red Sox started their rally with a home run by  Shane Victorino  in the eighth inning.  Boston got run-scoring singles in the ninth from Dustin Pedroia, Jonny Gomes, Shane Victorino and Daniel Nava, and Brock
Holt drove in another run with a double.  To contact the reporter on this story:
