Spot wholesale electricity rose from
the East Coast to the Midwest as hotter weather lifted demand.  The high temperature in New York City today will be 84
degrees Fahrenheit (29 Celsius), 3 above normal, and
 Washington ’s reading may exceed the average by 3 at 87 degrees,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  PJM Interconnection LLC said that demand on the 13-state
grid it manages, which includes Philadelphia, Washington and
Chicago, was 110,817 megawatts at 12:30 p.m., 2.9 percent higher
than the day-ahead outlook for the time. Consumption in  New
England  topped forecasts in the Northeast.  Spot on-peak power  at PJM’s benchmark Western hub, which
includes deliveries to Washington, gained $11.23, or 36 percent,
to average $42.85 a megawatt-hour as of 3 p.m. compared with
yesterday’s full-day average, grid data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. On-peak hours are Monday through Friday from 7 a.m.
until 11 p.m.  Transmission bottlenecks in  West Virginia  along the 500-kilovolt line between Mount Storm and Pruntytown briefly caused
hub prices to surge to more than $100, PJM data show. The line
helps transfer power from the western region of the grid to
outside the Washington metropolitan area.  New York City spot on-peak prices rose $23.70, or 72
percent, to $56.54 a megawatt-hour while  Boston  increased $3.31,
or 11 percent, to $33.45.  The premium for on-peak power price for  New York  versus
Boston widened to $23.09 a megawatt-hour as of 3 p.m. from
yesterday’s average of $2.70.  California prices gained as demand topped forecasts while
Texas consumers using less power than expected sent prices lower
on the main state grid.  On-peak power at Southern California’s SP15 hub was up
$6.96, or 25 percent, at $34.91 a megawatt-hour. Houston’s
average was down $9.90, or 27 percent, at $27.32 at 2 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
