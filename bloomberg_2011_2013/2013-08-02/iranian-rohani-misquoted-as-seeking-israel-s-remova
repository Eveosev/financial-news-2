Iranian President-elect Hassan Rohani’s comments on Israel were “distorted” by segments of
Iran’s own media, state run Press TV said, highlighting tensions
within the Islamic Republic.  “In our region, there’s been a wound for years on the body
of the Muslim world under the shadow of the occupation of the
holy land of  Palestine  and the beloved al-Quds,” Rohani said in
a  video  aired by Press TV of his appearance at the annual
pro-Palestinian holiday in Iran, known as Quds Day.  Earlier, the ISNA news agency, which is affiliated with
outgoing President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , quoted Rohani as saying
instead, “The Islamic world must show unity against the Zionist
regime, since this regime is an old wound that has lain for
years in its body and must be removed.”  Later ISNA corrected its translation. It came too late, as
Israeli prime minster  Benjamin Netanyahu  denounced Rohani.  “Rohani’s true face has been revealed earlier than
expected,” Netanyahu said in a statement. “Even if they will
now rush to deny his remarks, this is what the man thinks and
this is the plan of the Iranian regime.”  Rohani who will be inaugurated this weekend, was elected in
June by promising to reduce tensions with the West and curbing
state intrusion into private lives of citizens.  Iran severed relations with Israel in 1979 after the
 Islamic Revolution . The departing Ahmadinejad repeatedly called
for Israel to be eliminated during his 8-year term.  To contact the reporter on this story:
