Petrominerales Ltd. (PMG) , a Calgary-based
company that draws most of its output from  Colombia , fell the
most among members of the Colcap stock index as it said the sale
of a pipeline stake may take until the fourth quarter.  The shares slid 2.5 percent to 10,340 pesos at 1:13 p.m. in
Bogota, extending their weekly decline to 10 percent, the
biggest such drop since April. The Colcap climbed 0.8 percent
today and has risen 1.5 percent since July 26.  Petrominerales said yesterday in a statement that it will
join three other shareholders to sell a combined 27 percent
stake in the country’s Ocensa pipeline. Petrominerales said it
was seeking to close the sale with the other minority holders in
the fourth quarter. That would be a delay from the third-quarter
close it said it was seeking when the company announced in May
that it had hired advisers to help raise cash.  “People will be holding off from investing until the
pipeline disposition is complete,” Darren Engels, an analyst at
FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in Calgary, said in a telephone
interview. “It’s going to be now at best in October and maybe
not until December.”  Engels reduced the rating on the shares from the equivalent
of buy to hold.  Petrominerales got approval last month from holders of its
2016 convertible debt to extend a  put option  to demand repayment
until the earlier of February 2014 or 10 days after closing of
the sale of its 5 percent stake in Ocensa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
