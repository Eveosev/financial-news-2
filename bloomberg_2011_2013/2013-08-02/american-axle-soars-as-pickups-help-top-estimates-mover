American Axle & Manufacturing
Holdings Inc. (AXL)  rose to its highest closing price in more than
five years after the maker of axles and crankshafts for pickups
reported second-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts’
estimates.  The shares gained 5.8 percent to $20.94 in New York, the
biggest one-day increase since June 25 and the highest close
since May 2008. The Detroit-based company’s stock has gained 87
percent this year, compared with a 25 percent climb for the
Russell 2000 Index.  A rebounding housing market and an aging fleet of existing
trucks are fueling demand for new pickups, such as Chrysler
Group LLC’s Ram Heavy Duty and  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Silverado
and Sierra, for which the company supplies. This year through
July, full-size pickup sales increased 23 percent, according to
researcher Autodata Corp.  “We are working hard to meet that demand and push as hard
as they want to go,” Chief Financial Officer Michael Simonte
said on a conference call with analysts and investors.  American Axle, formerly owned by the predecessor of GM, has
been trying to diversify its customer base while strengthening
its balance sheet.  Net income rose more than fivefold to $25.8 million, or 34
cents a share, from $4.7 million, or 6 cents a share, a year
earlier, the company said. That exceed the 30-cent average of 11
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Second-quarter sales rose 8.1
percent to $799.6 million. Sales to customers other than GM rose
13 percent to $223.8 million in the quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
