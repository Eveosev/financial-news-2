Weight Watchers International Inc. (WTW) ,
the weight-control program provider endorsed by celebrities
 Jennifer Hudson  and Jessica Simpson, fell the most since its
market debut after saying profit this year will be less than
previously forecast as it struggles to recruit members.  Weight Watchers fell 19 percent to $37.99 at the close in
 New York , the biggest drop since the company went public in
November 2001. The shares have retreated 27 percent this year,
compared with a 20 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  Per-share profit this year will be $3.55 to $3.70, less
than an earlier projection of $3.60 to $3.90, the New York-based
company said yesterday in a statement. The average estimate of
seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $3.70.  The revision reflects “continued softness in the meetings
business and slowing growth online,” Robert L. Craig, an
analyst at Stifel Financial Corp., said in a note to clients
today. Second-quarter sales fell 4.1 percent to $465.1 million
as North American meeting revenue slid 7.4 percent.  Separately, the company said David Kirchhoff resigned as
chief executive officer and from the board effective July 30 to
pursue other opportunities. He was replaced by Jim Chambers, who
previously was chief operating officer.  “Current business conditions are challenging,” Chambers
said in the statement. “The 2013 recruitment weakness means
that we’ll start off 2014 with fewer active members and
therefore a lower earnings base.”  Second-quarter profit excluding some items was $1.39 a
share, topping analysts’ $1.11 average estimate. Net income fell
16 percent to $64.9 million, or $1.15 a share, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
