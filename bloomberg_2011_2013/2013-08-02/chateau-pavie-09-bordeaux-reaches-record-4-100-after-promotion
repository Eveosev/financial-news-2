A case of 2009 Chateau Pavie, a
Bordeaux vineyard promoted in last year’s classification of
Saint-Emilion wines, sold for a record 2,710 pounds ($4,100)
this week on Liv-ex, more than 20 percent above its level of a
year ago.  Pavie prices have risen since its promotion to the ranks of
the top four growers in Saint-Emilion last September. It now
rates as a Premier Grand Cru Classe A alongside Chateau Cheval
Blanc, Chateau Ausone and Chateau Angelus in the classification,
which replaced one dating from 1996.  The 2009 vintage of Pavie has outpaced the Liv-ex Fine Wine
50 Index, which has risen 6 percent in the past year. While
Bordeaux wines have slipped in the past four months during the
sales campaign for the region’s 2012 vintage, prices are now
showing more stability, both on Liv-ex and at auction.  “Bordeaux has remained strong, if priced correctly,”
Richard Harvey, International Director of Bonhams wine
department in  London , said by phone yesterday.  Pavie 2009 has risen 26 percent from the 2,150 pounds at
which it traded in August 2012, before its promotion gave a
boost to prices, according to London-based Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch
website. Angelus was promoted alongside it.  The trade at 2,710 pounds took place July 30, with three
half-cases sold the following day at an equivalent per-case rate
of 2,700 pounds.  The estate, on the right bank of the Dordogne, was acquired
by Gerard and Chantal Perse in 1998 and has about 35 hectares
(86 acres) under vines, predominantly Merlot with some Cabernet
Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon.  The 2009 Pavie is the estate’s most expensive since the
2000 vintage, according to merchant data compiled by Liv-ex, and
was awarded a perfect 100 points by U.S. critic  Robert Parker .  To contact the reporter on this story:
