Tiger Woods  takes a seven-shot lead
into today’s third round of the Bridgestone Invitational after
tying his career best by shooting a 9-under-par 61 in the second
round of the World Golf Championships event.  Woods, 37, who is 13 under through two rounds, is seeking
his ninth win in the tournament at Firestone Country Club in
Akron,  Ohio .  Woods had a chance to become the sixth player in PGA Tour
history to shoot a 59 before missing a 6-foot birdie putt and
making par on 17. He then made a 26-foot par putt on the 18th
hole from just off the green in a steady rain. Birdies on the
final two holes would have given him a 59.  “I felt really good, I had it going today,” Woods said in
a television interview. “It’s the second day. It put me in a
nice position going into the weekend.”  Keegan Bradley of the U.S. and Chris Wood of Britain are
tied for second at 6-under.  Woods, who has four victories on the  PGA Tour  this season,
was 4-under after three holes yesterday following a birdie-eagle-birdie start. He made another birdie on the seventh hole
and four straight from the 10th to the 14th holes to move to 9
under before finishing the round with five straight pars.  Woods shot a 4-under 66 in the first round and began play
yesterday two shots off the lead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
