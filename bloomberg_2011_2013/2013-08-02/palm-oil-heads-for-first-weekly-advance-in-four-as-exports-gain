Palm oil  climbed for a fourth day,
poised for the biggest weekly gain since February, as a weaker
ringgit increased prospects for exports from Malaysia, the
world’s second-largest producer.  The contract for delivery in October rose as much as 0.6
percent to 2,273 ringgit ($698) on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives and ended the morning session at 2,271 ringgit.
Futures are set for a 4 percent gain this week, rebounding from
the lowest price since October 2009 reached on July 26.  Palm oil shipments from Malaysia gained 5.3 percent to 1.39
million tons in July from a month earlier, according to SGS
(Malaysia) Sdn. This compares with a 24 percent drop in the
first half of the month and a 6 percent decline in the first 25
days of July, SGS estimates show. The ringgit headed for its
biggest weekly loss in more than a month after  Fitch Ratings 
lowered Malaysia’s credit outlook to negative.  “The weaker ringgit coupled with a stronger exports data
toward the last few days of the month boosted sentiment and
suggested that lower prices have been successful in attracting
demand,” said Ivy Ng, an analyst at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd.,
by phone from  Kuala Lumpur . “The trend is cautious. Production
in August may drop a bit as workers may be taking some time off
for the holidays, but come September there are concerns that
production may pick up again.”  Indonesian markets are closed the whole of next week, while
Malaysia will be shut on Aug. 8 and 9 for Eid holidays.  Soybean oil  for delivery in December advanced 0.6 percent
to 43.16 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans
for November gained 0.5 percent to $11.985 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for January delivery climbed 0.3 percent
to 5,426 yuan ($885) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil was little changed at 7,016  yuan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
