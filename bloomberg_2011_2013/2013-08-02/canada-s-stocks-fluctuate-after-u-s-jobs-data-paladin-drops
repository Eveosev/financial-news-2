Canadian  stocks  were little changed
after rallying the most in three weeks yesterday, as gains among
precious metals producers offset losses in industrial shares
after the U.S. added fewer jobs than forecast last month.  SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. (SNC) , Canada’s largest engineering
company, sank 6.1 percent after reporting an unexpected second-quarter loss. Bombardier Inc. dropped 1.3 percent as the
aircraft maker said it’s still not certain when its CSeries jet
will fly.  Paladin Energy Ltd. (PDN)  plunged 28 percent after saying
yesterday that it will sell additional shares. Turquoise Hill
Resources Ltd., a unit of Rio Tinto Group, jumped 16 percent for
a third day of gains after agreeing to sell one of its assets.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 0.52 points
to 12,594.48 at 10:14 a.m. in Toronto. The gauge has gained 1.3
percent this year.  U.S. payrolls rose by 162,000 last month, less than an
estimated 185,000 and the smallest advance in four months. The
unemployment rate dropped to 7.4 percent from 7.6 percent.  The U.S. Federal Reserve has indicated its $85 billion
monthly bond buying may be trimmed should the economy meet its
forecasts, though Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has said there’s no
fixed schedule for reducing stimulus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
