CareFusion Corp. (CFN)  shares tumbled the
most in 19 months after  Smiths Group (SMIN)  said talks to sell its
medical equipment division had collapsed.  Shares in San Diego-based CareFusion  fell  6 percent to
$36.61 at the close in  New York , the biggest single-day decline
since January 2012, leaving CareFusion valued at $8 billion.
Smiths  fell  5.5 percent to 1,320 pence, the most in two years,
in London trading.  Smiths said May 31 it had received an approach for its
medical-equipment division, which makes critical-care and
surgical products for hospitals. The Financial Times a day
earlier had reported the London-based technology company was
considering a sale valued at more than 2 billion pounds. Bidders
might include CareFusion, the newspaper said. The American
company makes medical pumps, ventilators and medicine
dispensers.  “It has not proved possible to reach agreement with the
potential party on acceptable terms for a transaction,” Smiths
said in a statement today. “Discussions have therefore been
terminated.”  In February 2011, Smiths had spurned a 2.45 billion-pound
offer for the business. It valued the unit at 3.1 billion
pounds, people familiar with the matter said at the time.  Trading volume in both CareFusion and Smiths today was more
than three times the three-month daily average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
