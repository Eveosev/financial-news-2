Britain summoned  Spain ’s ambassador
in London to protest delays to travelers crossing the border
between Spain and the U.K. territory of Gibraltar on the
southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula.  The Spanish envoy, Federico Trillo, was called in today as
Britain sought reassurances that there would be no repeat this
weekend of additional border checks imposed on four days late
last month by Spanish officials, the Foreign Office in London
said in an e-mailed statement.  “There were long delays at the Gibraltar-Spain border of
up to seven hours, as a result of wholly disproportionate checks
introduced by the Spanish authorities on vehicles both leaving
and entering Gibraltar,” Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire
said in the statement. “The U.K. government’s position is that
these delays are unjustified, unacceptable and have no place at
a border between EU partners.”  Britain last summoned the Spanish envoy in November to
protest incursions by Spanish naval and customs vessels into
Gibraltar’s territorial waters. Spain contests British
sovereignty over the self-governing territory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
