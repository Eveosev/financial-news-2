(Corrects to remove reference to Aleynikov's incarceration in first paragraph.) Happy Friday. We got your morning links right here. Michael Lewis  puts Goldman Sachs and the government on trial The courtroom saga of Sergey Aleynikov, the former Goldman Sachs programmer convicted of stealing computer code from the bank, is one of the strangest Wall Street stories in recent memory. All Goldman had to do was call up the feds and say he committed a crime, and the government dutifully followed its instructions by arresting him immediately. A young prosecutor at the first court hearing on the case said the code Aleynikov took with him could be used “to manipulate markets in unfair ways,” as if Goldman would use it only for noble purposes. He opened up for a lengthy feature in Vanity Fair written by Michael Lewis, who makes the case that Goldman and the government overstepped. It’s a great narrative. The  hole  in Barclays’s balance sheet Floyd Norris of the New York Times has an excellent column that explains the history of how the British bank wound up badly short of capital, and how banking regulators contributed to its problems. As usual, he nails it. Bad week for  Fabulous Fab This is the second time this week that I’ve recommended a piece by Matt Levine at Dealbreaker. But, hey, the guy is seriously funny. And he writes footnotes. His take on yesterday’s verdict in the Fabrice Tourre trial: “Poor Fab! I, for one, was utterly persuaded that he didn’t commit securities fraud by sending an email that he admitted was `not accurate’ but not `false,’ but the significance of that distinction seems to have eluded the jury.” There’s a silver lining for Goldman Sachs. Now it looks smart to have settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission when it had the chance three years ago. Good week for the reporter who got an  interview  with Fab Wall Street Journal reporter Justin Baer got exclusive pre-verdict interviews with Fab. Now that the jury verdict is out, the embargo is over. “I’m not naïve,” Tourre said. “It’s going to stay with me forever.” A-Rod puts new twist on  stadium curse Maybe it’s not just corporations that doom themselves by paying for stadium naming rights. (Remember Enron Field in Houston?) The name of the University of Miami’s baseball stadium is Alex Rodriguez Park. Dave Hyde, sports columnist for the Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, writes: “Rodriguez's name sits for a while longer there on Miami's baseball stadium, just like it does on the Yankees’ roster. If he's suspended for life, the way baseball wants, the name of a cheater can't stay on a college stadium. You can't expect players to compete, fair and square, in Alex Rodriguez Park.” His name is on there because he donated $3.9 million for stadium renovations. Bad trade. Live and learn.
