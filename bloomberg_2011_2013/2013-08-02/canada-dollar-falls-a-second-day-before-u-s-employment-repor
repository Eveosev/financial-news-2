The Canadian dollar declined for a
second day before a U.S. government report forecast to show
employers added jobs last month, adding to speculation the
nation’s largest trading partner is closer to ending stimulus.  Payrolls in the U.S. rose by 185,000 workers after a
195,000 gain in June, according to the median forecast of 92
economists in a Bloomberg survey. The jobless rate fell to 7.5
percent, matching a four-year low, from 7.6 percent.  Strong data are “a no-doubt-about-it sign of recovery in
the U.S.,”  Joe Manimbo , a market analyst at Western Union
Business Solutions, a unit of Western Union Co., said by phone
from  Washington  before the report. Investors will “ramp up
already elevated bets on an early-taper scenario,” he said.  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is nicknamed for the
image of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, depreciated 0.5
percent to C$1.0396 per  U.S. dollar  at 7:47 a.m. in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
