Mali will hold a run-off presidential
election after former Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita
failed to get a majority of votes necessary for an outright
victory in the first round.  Boubacar Keita got 39.2 percent of the vote, followed by
Soumaila Cisse, who garnered 19.4 percent, Moussa Sinko
Coulibaly, the minister of territorial administration, told
reporters today in Bamako. The results will be sent to the
 Constitutional Court  to be validated, Sinko Coulibaly said.  Malians voted in presidential elections this week more than
a year after the military led a coup because of the lack of
support in a battle against ethnic-Touareg rebels in the north.
French and African forces stepped in to stop the rebellion after
the Touaregs joined Islamists militants in an offensive that
almost split the country.  The elections, the first since 2007, were necessary to
unlock aid from donors frozen since the coup. The west African
nation is the continentâ€™s third-largest gold producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
