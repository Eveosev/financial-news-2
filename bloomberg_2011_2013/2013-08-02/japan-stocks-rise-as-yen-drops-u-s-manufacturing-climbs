Japanese  stocks  rose, with the Topix
index posting its biggest advance in five weeks, as the yen
touched its lowest against the dollar in a week and U.S. factory
activity surged.  Toyota Motor Corp., Asia’s biggest carmaker, rose 3.4
percent on the yen’s drop and before reporting earnings after
markets closed. Suzuki Motor Corp. jumped 5.8 percent after the
automaker raised its full-year profit forecast. Sharp Corp.,
which supplies screens to Apple Inc., gained 3.4 percent after
posting a narrower loss than expected. Japan Exchange Group Inc.
added 5.8 percent after the bourse said it’s in talks to provide
its trading system to Tokyo Commodity Exchange Inc.  The Topix gained 2.8 percent to 1,196.17 at the close in
 Tokyo , the biggest rally since June 28. The gauge gained 2.5
percent this week. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 3.3
percent today to 14,466.16. U.S. manufacturing expanded in July
at the fastest pace in more than two years, while investors
awaited U.S. jobs data today that may give clues on when the
Federal Reserve will start tapering record stimulus.  “The biggest reason to buy Japanese stocks today is that
strong U.S. data boosted U.S. yields and weakened the yen,”
said Kuninobu Takeuchi, Tokyo-based executive portfolio manager
at DIAM Co., which oversees more than $124 billion in assets
globally. “First-quarter earnings are pretty good. Investors
are buying on dips even after some companies miss analysts’
full-year estimates.”  The  Topix (TPX)  rose 39 percent this year amid optimism Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe will push through reforms while the Bank of
Japan continues record stimulus. The equity gauge traded at 1.26
times book value today, compared with 2.51 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 1.68 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
yesterday.  Yen Drops  Shares advanced after the yen slumped 1.7 percent, the
biggest drop since April, to 99.54 per dollar yesterday. It
touched 99.75 today. Toyota gained 3.4 percent to 6,430 yen.
Nissan Motor Co., a carmaker that gets 34 percent of sales in
North America, rose 3.1 percent to 1,071 yen.  Toyota raised its profit forecast by 8 percent, the company
said after markets closed. The weaker yen is boosting the value
of Japanese cars sold overseas, it said.  Of the 183 companies on the Topix that have posted
quarterly results and for which Bloomberg had estimates, 57
percent beat projections.  Suzuki gained 5.8 percent to 2,569 yen after raising its
full-year net forecast 11 percent to 100 billion yen.  Sharp climbed 3.4 percent to 425 yen after the company’s
net loss totaled 18 billion yen in the three months through
June, compared with a 138 billion-yen loss a year earlier.  U.S. Manufacturing  Futures on the S&P 500 added 0.1 percent today. The measure
rose above 1,700 for the first time in New York yesterday. The
Institute for Supply Management’s factory index for July jumped
to 55.4, exceeding the highest projection in a Bloomberg survey
of economists, according to the Tempe, Arizona-based group.  The data came after the Federal Reserve said on July 31
that persistently low inflation could hamper the economy and
pledged to keep buying $85 billion in bonds every month.  Separately, U.S. payrolls are expected to rise by 185,000
in July after a 195,000 gain in June, while the jobless rate may
fall to 7.5 percent from 7.6 percent, according to a Bloomberg
survey ahead of official data due today.  Among other stocks that gained,  Japan  Exchange, the
operator of the biggest stock market outside the U.S. by value
of companies listed, added 5.8 percent to 10,030 yen.  Tokyo Commodity Exchange, known as Tocom, is examining
options beyond next May when its five-year contract to use the
trading platform of Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. comes up for renewal,
said spokeswoman Sayaka Sato. It may keep and upgrade the Nasdaq
system or shift to a platform provided by a different domestic
or overseas exchange, she said. The two companies are in talks
and nothing has been decided yet, Japan Exchange spokesman Naoya
Takahashi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
