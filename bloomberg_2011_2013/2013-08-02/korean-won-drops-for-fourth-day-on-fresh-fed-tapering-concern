 The won fell for a fourth day, the
longest losing streak since March, as better-than-forecast U.S.
economic data bolstered the case for the  Federal Reserve  to cut
stimulus that’s fueled fund flows to  emerging markets .  The yield on  South Korea ’s three-year bonds rose by the
most in a week after U.S. reports yesterday showed jobless
claims fell to a five-year low and manufacturing expanded at the
fastest pace in two years. The Fed said July 31 that it would
maintain its $85 billion a month debt-buying program. South
Korea’s growth momentum is “weak,” Finance Minister Hyun Oh
Seok said yesterday as data showed the country’s trade surplus
narrowed and industrial production fell.  “Investors are paying more attention to the U.S. economic
data than the Fed’s words,” said D.J. Park, a fixed-income
analyst at Samsung Futures Inc. in  Seoul . “Because the data has
been better-than-expected, the tapering concerns are back.”  The won dropped 0.3 percent to 1,126.88 per dollar as of
10:27 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency declined 1.4 percent this week. The yield on the
2.75 percent bonds due June 2016 rose six basis points today and
four basis points this week to 2.98 percent, the highest level
since July 9, according to Korea Exchange Inc. prices.  Economic Data  South Korea’s trade surplus narrowed to $2.7 billion in
July, compared with a revised $6 billion in June, according to
government figures released yesterday. Industrial production
fell 2.6 percent in June from a year earlier, Statistics Korea
said July 30. U.S. jobless claims declined to 326,000 in the
week ending July 26 from 345,000 in the previous period, while
the  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index jumped to
55.4 in July from 50.9 the prior month.  “South Korea’s economic data didn’t meet expectations,
which is worrisome,” said Kim Do Hee, a Seoul-based currency
trader at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  “But
investors are more concerned about the Fed’s exit strategy.”  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, climbed five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 8.03 percent, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. It increased 72 basis points this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
