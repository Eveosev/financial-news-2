U.S. stocks  rose for the week,
sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index above 1,700 for the
first time, as central banks vowed to maintain stimulus and data
showed  economic growth  beat projections in the second quarter.  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. gained 13 percent for the week
as earnings topped forecasts.  Facebook Inc. (FB)  jumped 12 percent,
rising above its $38 initial public offering price. Dell Inc.
advanced 5.7 percent as Michael Dell agreed to sweeten his offer
for the computer maker. Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. lost
more than 2 percent as profits missed estimates.  Mosaic Co. and
Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. each fell 22 percent after OAO
Uralkali ended limits on potash production.  The S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent to 1,709.67 for the five days.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 99.53 points, or 0.6
percent, to 15,658.36, advancing for the sixth straight week.
Both gauges finished the week at record highs.  “We’ve had more talk this week from the FOMC meeting and
from the ECB that the spigot is still turned on,” Michael Mullaney, Boston-based chief investment officer for Fiduciary
Trust Co., said in a telephone interview. His firm oversees $10
billion. “They basically have put a safety net under investors.
We are overweight in equity right now.”  Global stocks rallied after the Federal Reserve said
persistently low inflation could hamper the economy and pledged
to keep buying $85 billion in bonds every month. European
Central Bank President Mario Draghi said recent economic
indicators signal that the euro region is through the worst and
reiterated that officials plan to keep interest rates low for
the foreseeable future.  GDP Growth  Data during the week showed U.S. gross domestic product,
the value of all goods and services produced, rose at a better-than-forecast 1.7 percent annualized rate last quarter, after a
1.1 percent gain the prior quarter, and manufacturing expanded
in July. While Fed officials said the labor market has shown
“improvement,” a report on Aug. 2 showed American companies
added fewer workers than anticipated in July. The  jobless rate 
fell to 7.4 percent.  Federal Open Market Committee policy makers have been
debating the pace and timing of any cuts in the monetary
stimulus that has helped propel the S&P 500 up more than 150
percent from its bear-market low in 2009. Tapering of the pace
of asset purchases may begin in September, according to a
growing number of economists surveyed by Bloomberg from July 18
to July 22.  ‘No Surprises’  “Investors were generally encouraged by earnings, economic
data and there being really no surprises from central banks,”
 Frederic Dickson , chief investment strategist who helps oversee
$35 billion at D.A. Davidson & Co. in Lake Oswego,  Oregon , said
in a telephone interview. “Investors walked away with a pretty
good feeling that we have already seen the worst of the flow of
economic data and translated that into higher stock prices.”  Investors have increasingly turned to stocks as $38.1
billion poured into exchange-traded funds listed in the U.S.
last month, the most since December 2008 and the fourth-highest
inflow ever, according to data compiled by Bloomberg since 2000.
Almost $30 billion of the deposits went to funds that buy and
sell American equities.  Stock valuations have climbed, with the S&P 500  trading  at
15.5 times projected earnings, compared with an average of 13.9
over the last five years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Company Earnings  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which
measures the cost of protecting against swings in the S&P 500,
dropped 5.8 percent to 11.98 for the week. The  VIX (VIX)  is at its
lowest level since March 15.  Of the 391 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported
 earnings  so far, 74 percent have topped analysts’ estimates,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About 56 percent have
beaten revenue projections. About 57 S&P 500 companies are
scheduled to release quarterly results in the coming week.  “From companies reporting earnings, what we’ve seen is
fairly good numbers,” Brian Burrell, equity research analyst
for Thornburg Investment Management Inc., said in a telephone
interview from Santa Fe, New Mexico. His firm oversees about $90
billion. “It’s important to note that a lot of the beats that
we have seen are coming from the bottom line and strong
margins.”  Industrials Rally  Industrial companies led  gains  among the 10 major
industries in the S&P 500, rising 2.1 percent for the week.
Caterpillar Inc. jumped 2.7 percent to $84.30 and Lockheed
Martin Corp. added 3.1 percent to $123.77.  Pitney Bowes, a provider of postal meters, jumped 21
percent, the most in the S&P 500, to $17.46 after agreeing to
sell its management-services unit to Apollo Global Management
LLC.  Consumer-discretionary stocks advanced 2 percent. Goodyear
climbed 13 percent to $19.02 as the largest U.S. tiremaker
reported quarterly net income that more than doubled from a year
earlier.  LinkedIn Corp. gained 13 percent to $235.58 after posting
second-quarter revenue that beat analysts’ estimates and
membership of 238 million that more than doubled from mid-2011.  Facebook  climbed  12 percent to $38.05, topping its $38 IPO
price. The stock has surged 44 percent since the company said
July 24 that mobile advertising revenue grew in the second
quarter.  Dell Inc. increased 5.7 percent to $13.68 after  Michael
Dell  and Silver Lake Management LLC agreed to increase their
offer for the computer maker to $13.75 a share with a special
dividend of 13 cents. Dell and Silver Lake had offered $13.65.  Oil Companies  Energy shares sank 0.3 percent as a group after Exxon and
Chevron missed earnings estimates as demand and prices for crude
oil fell. Brent crude futures, a global benchmark, averaged
$103.35 a barrel during the second quarter, down 5 percent from
$108.76 a year earlier.  Exxon, the world’s biggest energy company by market value,
fell 3 percent to $91.95, the most in the Dow. Earnings trailed
analyst estimates by the most in more than a decade. Chevron,
the second-largest in the industry, fell 2.1 percent to $124.95
after reporting its biggest second-quarter profit decline in
four years.  Coach Inc. (COH)   tumbled  9.9 percent to $53.33 after saying
second-quarter revenue fell at its established stores in North
America and that the trend would continue as increasing
competition hurts handbag sales.  Potash Prices  Visa Inc. (V) , the world’s biggest payment network,  sank  4.8
percent to $184 after a judge ruled that the Fed had erred by
inflating debit-card fees and restricting retailers’ choice of
network.  Potash makers plunged after Uralkali, the world’s largest
producer of the nutrient, upended the $20 billion-a-year
commodity market by abandoning limits on output that underpinned
prices while halting cooperation with Belarus that controlled
supplies from the former Soviet Union.  Mosaic, the biggest U.S.-based maker of crop nutrients,
fell 22 percent to $40.98. Potash Corp. slid 22 percent to
$28.91.  To contact the reporter on this story:
