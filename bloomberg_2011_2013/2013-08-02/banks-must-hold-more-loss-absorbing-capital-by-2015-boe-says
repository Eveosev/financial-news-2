Banks must hold better quality
capital against risks not captured by Basel rules, the U.K.’s
top banking regulator proposed, as it prepares to implement
European Union standards.  Capital held against risks identified by the supervisor
should be mostly made up of high-quality common equity tier 1
capital, which better absorbs losses in a crisis, the
U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority, a unit of the  Bank of
England , said in a statement on its website. The requirement
will take effect in 2015.  “Well capitalized and resilient firms are crucial for
ensuring financial stability and supporting U.K. growth,”
 Andrew Bailey , the PRA’s chief executive officer, said in an e-mailed statement. “The PRA has already acted to increase both
the amount and quality of capital held by firms, reflecting our
determination to improve the stability of U.K. firms after the
crisis.”  The EU measures are intended to apply standards, known as
Basel III, drawn up by global regulators to prevent a repeat of
the crisis that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. The PRA said it would seek views on its
plans for applying the EU rules, before publishing final
guidance in December.  The PRA proposals cover additional bank-specific
requirements to guard against risks posed by a particular bank’s
business model. The so-called Pillar 2 requirements must be met
by at least 56 percent common equity tier 1 capital, the central
bank said, and the regulator may further toughen the standards
in 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
