Illinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW) , under
pressure from investor Ralph Whitworth to increase profit,
authorized a share buyback plan for as much as $6 billion in
shares and boosted its dividend.  The repurchase program lets the Glenview, Illinois-based
maker of auto parts and welding products buy back common stock
over an open ended period of time, according to a statement
today. The existing plan of $4 billion announced in May 2011 had
about $1.2 billion remaining as of June 30.  Whitworth’s Relational Investors LLC took a  stake  in
Illinois Tool last year and urged management to reduce the
number of business units and cut costs. This year, Illinois Tool
hired JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to study
the possible sale of its industrial packaging unit.  Illinois Tool  rose  0.8 percent to $74.30 at 1:51 p.m. in
 New York , reversing an earlier decline of as much as 1.2
percent. The shares advanced 21 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with a 20 percent gain for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  Yesterday’s closing price of $73.69 gave Illinois Tool a
market value of about $33.3 billion, making the buyback
reauthorization equivalent to roughly 18 percent of that figure.  The quarterly  dividend  was increased 10.5 percent to 42
cents per share, matching the average of analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg, and will be paid on Oct. 8 to
shareholders of record as of Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
