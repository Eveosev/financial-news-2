The number of tin futures outstanding
on the London Metal Exchange reached a two-week high at the same
time that prices climbed, signaling traders turned bullish on
the metal.  Open interest  in tin came to 28,898 futures contracts as of
July 31, up 4.3 percent from a week earlier and the highest
since July 16, LME figures showed. Prices advanced 4.6 percent
in the week. Each contract represents 5 metric tons of tin, used
mostly to make solders for joining metals together.  A combination of higher open interest and climbing prices
suggests new long positions, or bets on a rising market,
according to Macquarie Group Ltd. Tin reached the highest level
in almost two months today on the LME.  Open interest in copper, aluminum, zinc and nickel rose in
the week through July 31 as prices fell, suggesting new short
positions, or bearish wagers.  “While the market is still short and vulnerable to a
squeeze, the extremity of short interest and subsequent
intensity of a squeeze-type event has started to drop,” analyst
George Adcock at Marex Spectron Group in  London  said by e-mail
today.  Following are changes to market open interest for both LME
members and their clients for the exchange’s six main
industrial-metals futures in the week ended July 31. The figures
were compiled by the LME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
