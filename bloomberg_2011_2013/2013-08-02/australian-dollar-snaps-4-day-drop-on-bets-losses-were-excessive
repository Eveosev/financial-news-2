Australia ’s dollar slid to the lowest
in almost three years before U.S. jobs data that may add to the
case for a reduction in Federal Reserve stimulus, which has
supported higher-yielding assets globally.  The Aussie fell for a fifth day before  Reserve Bank  of
Australia officials gather for a monetary policy decision next
week, where they are expected to lower borrowing costs.  New
Zealand ’s kiwi dollar held a four-day decline.  “The risk is that Aussie and kiwi do weaken on the back of
a stronger payrolls number,” said Peter Dragicevich, a Sydney-based currency economist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the
nation’s largest lender. Improving U.S. data “would just
reinforce expectations that the Fed will begin to taper asset
purchases over the next few months.”  The Australian dollar fell 0.4 percent to 88.92 U.S. cents
as of 11:59 a.m. in Sydney and is set for a 4 percent slide this
week, the most since September 2011. It touched 88.89 cents, the
weakest since August 2010. It The kiwi was little changed at
78.90 U.S. cents. It’s headed for a 2.4 percent, five-day drop,
the most since the period through June 21.  Australia’s  10-year government bond yield  climbed nine
basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 3.76 percent. New
Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to receive
floating rates, rose three basis points to 3.39 percent.
.  Jobs Added  The U.S. Labor department will probably say today employers
added 185,000 jobs last month after boosting positions by
195,000 in June, according the median estimate of economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News . The  unemployment rate  may have
fallen to 7.5 percent, which would be the lowest since April.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will trim the
central bank’s monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage debt
to $65 billion in September, from the current pace of $85
billion, according to half of 54 economists polled by Bloomberg
from July 18-22.  The Aussie has lost almost 12 percent in the past three
months, the worst performance among 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The kiwi had the second-biggest decline, falling 5 percent.  The RBA will probably cut Australia’s overnight cash rate
target by 25 basis points to 2.5 percent at a policy meeting on
Aug. 6, according to 26 of 27 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg
News. Traders agree, seeing a 94 percent chance of a reduction,
according to  interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
