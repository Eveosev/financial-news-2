West Texas Intermediate crude
dropped, paring a weekly advance, after U.S. employers added
fewer workers than anticipated last month.  Futures fell 0.9 percent on Labor Department figures
showing that payrolls rose 162,000 in July, the smallest gain in
four months. A 185,000 increase was the median forecast of 93
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Brent earlier exceeded $110
for the first time since April after Libya’s head of oil
security quit as protests shut export terminals in the country.  “The disappointing employment numbers are weighing on the
market,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a
 New York  hedge fund that focuses on energy. “A lot of the rally
this week was based on the prospect for an improving economy and
the prospect for demand growth in the U.S. Oil is taking today’s
report pretty hard.”  WTI crude for September delivery declined 95 cents to
settle at $106.94 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Prices increased 2.1 percent this week. Oil rose 2.7 percent to
$107.89 yesterday, the most since July 10 and the highest close
since July 19. The volume of all futures traded was 13 percent
lower than the 100-day average at 3:52 p.m.  Brent oil for September settlement dropped 59 cents, or 0.5
percent, to end the session at $108.95 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The contract surged to
$110.09 earlier, topping $110 for the first time since April 3.
The volume of all futures traded was 26 percent below the 100-day average.  The European benchmark grade’s premium to WTI widened to
$2.01 from $1.65 yesterday.  Jobless Rate  American workers spent fewer hours on the job and hourly
earnings fell for the first time since October, according to the
Labor Department report released in  Washington . The  jobless rate 
dropped to 7.4 percent.  “The employment data came in soft, and that’s a worry for
the market,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at
Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, which oversees
$1.6 billion. “The hope has been that economic growth will
accelerate, and this is another sign that it’s glacial.”  Futures climbed earlier this week on signs U.S. economic
growth is accelerating. Gross domestic product, the value of all
goods and services produced, expanded at a 1.7 percent
annualized rate in the April-through-June period after a 1.1
percent advance in the prior three months, Commerce Department
data showed on July 31.  Market Outlook  WTI may rise next week on signs that growth will stoke fuel
demand, a separate Bloomberg survey showed. Fifteen of 33
analysts and traders, or 45 percent, forecast crude will
increase through Aug. 9. Thirteen respondents, or 39 percent,
predicted a decline, and five said there would be no change.  “The market is moving lower on the disappointing jobs
number,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The market has
overextended to the upside this week and was set for a pullback.
This is probably a temporary setback.”  Colonel Ali Ahrash, Libya’s head of security for oil and
gas infrastructure, has resigned, Deputy Oil Minister Omar Shakmak said yesterday in Washington. Libyan crude exports were
set to drop by almost 80 percent after terminals were shut amid
labor protests, Oil Minister Abdulbari Al-Arusi said July 31.  The closures were forecast to cut shipments by about 1.1
million barrels a day from 1.425 million, according to Al-Arusi.  Libyan crude output  tumbled 330,000 barrels to 800,000
barrels a day in July, a Bloomberg survey of Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries production showed. It was the
fourth straight decline and sent production to the lowest level
since December 2011.  Terrorist Warnings  The U.S. State Department issued a worldwide travel alert
today warning citizens of potential terror attacks in the Middle
East and North Africa by al-Qaeda and its affiliates. Attacks
are seen as occurring in or emanating from the Arabian
peninsula, the department said. Yesterday, the department said
that a number of U.S. embassies and other facilities would be
closed this weekend as a precaution.  Russia , the world’s biggest oil-producing country,  pumped 
10.43 million barrels a day of crude and condensate last month,
near a post-Soviet record, according to preliminary data sent by
e-mail today from the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit in Moscow.
Soviet-era production in Russia peaked at 11.48 million barrels
in 1987.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
September was 20.5 percent, down from 21.8 percent yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 483,438
contracts as of 3:52 p.m. It totaled 700,506 contracts
yesterday, 5.9 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.86 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
