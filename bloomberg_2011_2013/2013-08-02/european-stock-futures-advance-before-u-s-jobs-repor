day, extending a nine-week high, as company earnings beat
estimates and investors studied U.S. jobs data for indications
of when the  Federal Reserve  will start to pare stimulus.  Axa (CS)  SA rose to a three-year high as property and casualty
earnings boosted first-half operating profit at the insurer. Man

the second quarter.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index rose 0.3 percent to 304.15. The

that the Fed won’t reduce its bond purchases until the economy
gains substantial traction.  “We expect some stability in the economic figures out of
the U.S., where we’ll see neither big negative nor big positive
news,” Guillaume Duchesne, an equity strategist at BGL BNP
Paribas SA in Luxembourg, said in a phone interview. “We see
any retreat in European equities as an opportunity to add to
holdings, because with the stabilization of the political and
economic situation, coupled with attractive valuations, this can
provide support for equities.”  A gauge of expected volatility in euro-area stocks,
measured by options prices, fell 7.2 percent this week, to close
