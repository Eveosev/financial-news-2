U.S.  farmland values  climbed 9.4
percent this year as high prices paid for crops and livestock
after last yearâ€™s drought bolstered real-estate while commodity
prices fell, the Department of Agriculture said.  The average value of all land and buildings on farms and
ranches in the 48 contiguous states was $2,900 an acre,
according to a June survey of farmers, the USDA today said in an 
annual report , up from $2,650 a year earlier. The drought that
spread through the Corn Belt and Great Plains last year prompted
record insurance payments and will push farm profits to a record
 $128.2 billion  this year as growers rebuild inventories, the
USDA said in February.  The most expensive farmland was in  New Jersey  at $12,700 an
acre, followed by  Rhode Island  at $11,800, according to the
USDA. The cheapest was in  New Mexico  at $550 an acre. The Corn
Belt was the most expensive of the 10 regions tracked by the
USDA, averaging $6,400 an acre after gaining 15 percent from the
previous year. The Mountain region had the lowest prices,
averaging $1,020 per acre.  The USDA will update its farm profit forecast on Aug. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
