Euro-area  producer prices  increased
from a year earlier for the first time in three months in June
as the economy showed increasing signs of starting to pull out
of a  record-long recession .  Factory-gate prices in the 17-nation euro area rose 0.3
percent after a 0.2 percent annual drop in May, the European
Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today. That matched
the median estimate of 16 economists in a  Bloomberg News survey .  Prices of durable  consumer goods  rose 0.7 percent in June,
while non-durable goods showed a 2.3 percent gain, according to
today’s report. Prices of capital goods increased 0.6 percent.  Energy prices fell 0.6 percent in June, a fourth straight
decline, and intermediate goods dropped 0.4 percent.  Euro-area annual consumer-price growth has been below the
ECB’s 2 percent ceiling since February. The European Central
Bank yesterday left its benchmark rate at a record low of 0.5
percent and reiterated last months’ forward guidance that all
key rates will stay at current levels or lower for an “extended
period of time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
