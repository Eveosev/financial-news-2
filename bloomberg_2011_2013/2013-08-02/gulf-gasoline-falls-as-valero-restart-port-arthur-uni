U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened
relative to futures after  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  restarted a unit
at the  Port Arthur ,  Texas , refinery.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline , or CBOB, on the Gulf
Coast slid 1.75 cents to a discount of  21.75 cents  a gallon
versus New York Mercantile Exchange futures at 2:12 p.m., a
second consecutive decline.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline 
also fell for a second day as it lost 1 cent to a discount of
12.75 cents a gallon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Differentials widened after Valero began increasing a fluid
catalytic cracker to planned rates at the  310,000-barrel-a-day
Port Arthur plant . The unit was first idled in early July and
later began repairs after a valve problem was found,  Bill Day , a
company spokesman based in  San Antonio , said in e-mails.  The unit’s restart may add to  inventories  already near a
six-month high on the Gulf Coast, the region known as PADD 3.
Stockpiles of gasoline in the area increased 1.5 million barrels
to 78.4 million in the week ended July 26, the most since Feb.
8, Energy Information Administration data showed..  Shipments from the Gulf Coast to  Chicago  on  Enterprise
Products Partners’ (EPD)  TE Pipeline are delayed by as many as 20 days
after shippers flooded the Gulf with supply, the company said in
a shipping bulletin July 29.  The TE line has the capacity to carry 200,000 to 230,000
barrels a day of refined products, including gasoline and
diesel. It runs from Texas to the Midwest and Northeast.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate oil in Cushing, Oklahoma, retreated 63 cents to
$13.46 a barrel, the lowest level since July 4. The  same spread
based  on Light Louisiana Sweet oil fell 78 cents to $8.46 a
barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Chicago crack spread , based on WTI, tumbled $1.29 to
$14.98 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
