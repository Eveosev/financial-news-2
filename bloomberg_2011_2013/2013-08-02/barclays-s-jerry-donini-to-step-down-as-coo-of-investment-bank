Barclays Plc’s (BARC)  Jerry Donini will step
down, less than a year after being named chief operating officer
of its corporate and investment banking division.  Donini, 49, will be replaced by Justin Bull from Sept. 1,
according to an internal memo seen by Bloomberg News.  He took up the job in October when then-investment banking
chief  Rich Ricci  combined some of the lender’s fixed income and
equities teams. Ricci announced his departure in April, becoming
one of the last of former Chief Executive Officer  Robert
Diamond ’s management team to leave after the lender was fined
for manipulating the London interbank offered rate.  Donini joined the London-based bank when Barclays bought
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s North American operations in
2008. Before working at Lehman, Donini was a senior index
options trader at Deutsche Bank AG.  Bull, who joined Barclays in 1997, will report to
investment bank chiefs Eric Bommensath and Tom King as well as
Shaygan Kheradpir, chief operations and technology officer,
according to the memo.  Officials at the bank declined to comment. The Wall Street
Journal reported the move earlier today.  -- Editors: Edward Evans,  Keith Campbell   To contact the reporter on this story:
