Tiger Woods will play in a threesome
with fellow Americans Keegan Bradley and  Davis Love III  during
the first two rounds of the PGA Championship, the last of golf’s
four annual major tournaments.  Woods, 37, will be seeking his 15th Grand Slam title -- and
his first since the 2008 U.S. Open -- at the tournament set for
Aug. 8-11 at Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, New York.  Phil Mickelson , who won the British Open in July, will play
with England’s  Justin Rose  and Australia’s Adam Scott in the
first two rounds, according to pairings released yesterday by
the PGA Tour.  The Woods-Bradley-Love trio is scheduled to tee off at 8:35
a.m. in the first round and 1:45 p.m. in the second round.  Woods shot a 9-under-par 61 yesterday in the second round
of the Bridgestone Invitational, tying his career-best round,
and holds a seven-shot lead heading into the weekend at the
World Golf Championships event in Akron, Ohio.  Bradley, 27, won the 2011  PGA Championship  title. Love, 49,
was the winner of the 1997 PGA Championship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
