Roads and bridges will be shut across
wide swathes of London this weekend as thousands of cyclists
take control of the streets in a series of sporting events.  Prudential RideLondon 2013 will affect transit routes in
east, central and southwest London, as well as parts of Surrey,
from today to tomorrow evening. The event will be the largest of
its kind since last year’s  Summer Olympics  road race.  “If you plan to drive in the affected areas over the
weekend, you’ll need to plan your route carefully or consider
using Tube or rail services,” Transport for London said in an
e-mailed statement yesterday.  Traffic disruption will be “fairly light” today, with
some closures in central London, and Southwark and Westminster
bridges will be closed to vehicles from 4 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Sunday’s events will result in more substantial disorder.
Information about disruptions, including maps, is available on
the TFL  website.   The event has four components, with two each day. A family-friendly, mass participation “FreeCycle” bike ride is
scheduled for today, along with a junior, hand-cycle and
professional women “Grand Prix.”  On Sunday, 20,000 amateur cyclists will ride a 100-mile
route in the Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100, and professional
cyclists will race an extended 140-mile route that retraces
parts of last year’s Olympic course.  To contact the reporter on this story:
