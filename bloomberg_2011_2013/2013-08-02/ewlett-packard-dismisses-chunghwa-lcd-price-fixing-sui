Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  ended a lawsuit
in which it accused Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. and  Tatung Co. (2371) 
of America Inc. of fixing the prices of liquid-crystal display
screens.  The three companies, in a filing yesterday in federal court
in  San Francisco , agreed to the dismissal of the case filed last
year. The filing didn’t explain why Hewlett-Packard was dropping
its claims against the Taiwanese companies.  Hewlett-Packard had alleged that it incurred more than
$1 billion in damages from overcharges for the screens that it
purchased through its Singapore unit and a Taiwan-based
procurement service. Hewlett-Packard claimed that Chunghwa,
Tatung and other LCD makers conspired to set prices and restrict
output for panels from 1998 to 2006.  Michael Thacker, a spokesman for  Palo Alto , California-based Hewlett-Packard, and David Brownstein, a lawyer
representing Chunghwa and Tatung in the case, didn’t immediately
respond to phone messages yesterday after regular business hours
seeking comment on the filing.  The case is Hewlett-Packard Co. v.  Chunghwa Picture Tubes
Ltd. (2475) , 12-06085, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
 California  (San Francisco.)  To contact the reporters on this story:
