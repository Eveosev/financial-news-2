American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the insurer that struck a deal to sell a plane lessor for $4.2
billion, said it plans to “protect our rights” to the 10
percent deposit it received if the would-be buyers fail to
complete the transaction.  “It is not a break-up fee,” AIG Chief Financial Officer
David Herzog said today in a conference call discussing second-quarter results at the New York-based company. “We’ll pursue
our rights under the terms of the contract.”  A group of Chinese investors has missed three deadlines,
the most recent one this week, to complete the purchase of Los
Angeles-based International Lease Finance Corp. AIG Chief
Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche  said he can’t be sure if the
deal will be completed and is prepared to dispose of the unit in
an initial public offering as an alternative.  “We’re continuing to negotiate with the consortium, and
keep in mind we don’t have a buyer but we have a group that is
buying ILFC, and so this is a very complicated transaction,”
Benmosche said on the call. “If they can come together and the
money comes in, then we will proceed. If not, we are preparing
ourselves for later this year for an IPO.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
