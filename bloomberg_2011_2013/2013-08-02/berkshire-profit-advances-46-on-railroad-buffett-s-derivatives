Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  said second-quarter profit climbed 46 percent on Chairman  Warren Buffett ’s
derivative bets and gains at the company’s railroad.  Net income  rose to $4.54 billion, or $2,763 a share, from
$3.11 billion, or $1,882, a year earlier, the Omaha, Nebraska-based company said today in a regulatory filing. Operating
earnings, which exclude some investment results, were $2,384 a
share, beating the $2,166 average  estimate  of three analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Berkshire has benefited this year as the U.S. economy
rebounded and stocks rallied, boosting the value of Buffett’s
 investments . The company’s operating businesses, including
railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, auto insurer Geico and
utility MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., do most of their
business in the world’s largest economy.  “As America goes, so goes Berkshire,”  Meyer Shields , an
analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said in a phone interview
before results were announced.  Class A shares rose 0.5 percent to $176,500 at 4 p.m. today
in New York prior to the release, extending their  advance  to 32
percent this year. That compares with the 20 percent rise in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Buffett’s derivative bets on stock market gains boosted
earnings by $390 million in the second quarter, compared with a
loss of $1.17 billion a year earlier. Fluctuations in the value
of the contracts are recorded in net income each quarter, even
though the wagers won’t be settled until 2018 or later.  Railroad, Utilities  Net income from BNSF, Buffett’s biggest acquisition,
climbed 10 percent from a year earlier to $884 million.
MidAmerican added $279 million to Berkshire’s profit compared
with $253 million in last year’s second quarter on higher
earnings at utility PacifiCorp and real-estate broker
HomeServices of America.  Book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, rose to
about $122,900 a share on June 30 from $120,525 on March 31.  Buffett, 82, and his  deputies  have been expanding Berkshire
this year through acquisitions. MidAmerican Chief Executive
Officer Greg Abel agreed in May to buy a Nevada utility for $5.6
billion.  Berkshire and  Jorge Paulo Lemann ’s 3G Capital completed
their purchase in June of HJ Heinz Co., with Buffett’s company
investing more than $12 billion for a preferred stake and half
the common stock, or 425 million shares. Berkshire also has
warrants to buy 46 million additional Heinz shares for 1 cent
each, today’s filing showed.  Stock Picks  Those deals, along with spending on plant and equipment at
BNSF and other units, are helping Berkshire deploy cash that
accumulates at a rate of about $1 billion a month. Buffett’s
firm spent $4.64 billion on stocks in the quarter, while selling
$781 million, according to the filing. Most of the increase was
in the category that Berkshire labels as “commercial,
industrial and other.”  The company’s stock portfolio was valued at $103.3 billion
on June 30, up from $97.2 billion at the end of March. The cash
pile fell 27 percent in three months to $35.7 billion on June 30
after the Heinz deal.  The insurance segment’s underwriting profit slipped 14
percent from last year’s second quarter to $530 million as
flooding in Europe boosted General Re’s claims. Geico’s
underwriting profit was $336 million before tax. Insurance
investment income rose about 7 percent to $1.14 billion.  Manufacturing, Retailing  Earnings from manufacturing, service and retailing units
increased to $1.07 billion in the second quarter from $1.03
billion in the same period in 2012. The group of businesses
includes engine-additive maker Lubrizol; Marmon Holdings, a
manufacturer of construction materials; and Fruit of the Loom,
which produces underwear and other clothing. Berkshire doesn’t
break down results by each business.  In the past 15 years, Buffett shifted the company toward
more capital-intensive industries, purchasing MidAmerican, the
railroad and manufacturing companies. Those bets have tethered
its results more to the U.S. economy and the housing market.  Among Berkshire’s operating units are paintmaker Benjamin
Moore; Clayton Homes, a builder of manufactured housing; and
HomeServices. Buffett’s firm is also the  largest shareholder  in
 Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the biggest U.S. mortgage lender.  Historically low borrowing costs, short supply and an
improving job market are boosting demand for residential real
estate. U.S. home prices rose in May by  12.2 percent  from a year
earlier, the biggest 12-month gain since 2006, according to the
S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities.  Gains in housing have helped propel a rebound in the U.S.
economy. Gross domestic product rose at a 1.7 percent annualized
rate in the second quarter, after a 1.1 percent gain in the
first three months of the year, Commerce Department figures
showed this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
