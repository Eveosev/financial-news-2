Six bottles of Montrachet Ramonet
1985 Burgundy sold for $13,090 and a case of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild 1982 Bordeaux fetched $11,900 at a Bonhams auction in
 San Francisco  amid demand from collectors for historic vintages.  The sale, held on July 27 and simulcast to  Los Angeles  and
 New York , raised a total of $843,020, with 91 percent of lots
sold, according to the auction house. The Montrachet and Mouton
lots went to bids matching their presale estimate.  Appetite for rare Burgundies has driven auctions in recent
months as collectors and investors focused more on wines from
the region. That’s after demand dropped in 2012 for Bordeaux,
which had fueled a  bull market  during the previous two years.  “Burgundy has done well, both red and white” Richard
Harvey, International Director of  Bonhams  wine department in
London, said by telephone. “It’s always sold well in the U.S.
Last week’s sale in  California  was good.”  Rare Burgundies featured a 12-bottle mixed lot of Meursault
from producer Pierre Morey, including eight bottles of his
Perrieres 1986, which sold for $1,904, beating the auction
house’s presale estimate.  Among older Bordeaux, a case of Chateau Latour 1966 fetched
$4,760, below its estimate, while Italian wines in the auction
included six bottles of Barbaresco Sori San Lorenzo Gaja, which
fetched $1,309, matching their estimate.  The auction came as the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, a
barometer of Bordeaux prices in the wider market, has risen 4
percent this year. It fell 2 percent in the second quarter, and
declined a further 1 percent during July, after a 7 percent gain
in the first three months.  Following is a table of major wine auctions held so far
