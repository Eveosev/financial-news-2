Yes Bank Ltd. (YES) , the Indian lender with
the lowest bad debt ratio, is seeking a two-part loan of about
$250 million-equivalent to refinance debt.  The facility, denominated in dollars and euros, will have
one-year and two-year maturities, Jaideep Iyer, Mumbai-based
deputy chief financial officer and group president for financial
management, said today in a phone interview.  “We have an international rating and so have enough
appetite to fill this up,” Iyer said. “Modalities are getting
worked out. It’s on the verge.”  The new loan facility will be completed this month, he said.
The lender has $1.1 billion of bonds and loans outstanding,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yes Bank is rated Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service, the
lowest investment grade. The Mumbai-based lender had raised an
equivalent of $216 million of dollar- and euro-denominated loans
in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. HSBC Holdings
Plc, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Standard Chartered Plc
and  State Bank of India (SBIN)  were among the lenders.  To contact the reporters on this story:
