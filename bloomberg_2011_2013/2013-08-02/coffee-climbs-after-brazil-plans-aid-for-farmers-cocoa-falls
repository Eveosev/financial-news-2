Arabica coffee climbed for the first
time in six days after the Wall Street Journal reported that
 Brazil ’s government will take steps to help farmers.  The agriculture ministry will hold a press conference about
the measures at 4 p.m. Brasilia time on Aug. 5, according to the
Journal, citing an unidentified ministry spokeswoman. Prices
dropped 18 percent this year as Brazil is harvesting more than
50 million bags after a record 56.1 million bags last year, U.S.
Department of Agriculture forecasts show.  “Measures out of Brazil could give temporary support,”
said Jerome Jourquin, head of agriculture derivatives at Aurel
BGC in Paris. “At the end of the day, whatever they do, coffee
will have to be exported so they can give subsidies to farmers
for example but it does not mean the price on the international
free market will continue to go up.”  Arabica for September delivery rose 1.8 percent to $1.1765
a pound by 6:38 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . Robusta
beans traded in  London  gained 0.2 percent to $1,869 a metric ton
(84.78 cents a pound).  Raw sugar fell 0.3 percent to 16.78 cents a pound in New
York and white, or refined, sugar gained 0.1 percent to $488.70
a ton.  Cocoa fell 0.2 percent to $2,296 a ton in New York and
declined 0.1 percent to 1,564 pounds ($2,369) a ton in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
