The U.S. State Department has issued a new worldwide alert to citizens warning of potential terrorist attacks, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa.  The department, which said yesterday that embassies in a number of countries would be closed Sunday, said the attacks are seen as possibly occurring in or emanating from the Arabian Peninsula. “Current information suggests that al-Qaeda and affiliated organizations continue to plan terrorist attacks both in the region and beyond,” the alert said.
