A five-year high in confidence among
American consumers signals that U.S. equities will peak within
four months, according to Citigroup Inc.’s Tom Fitzpatrick.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index rallied to record highs after the Conference Board’s
consumer-sentiment index peaked in January 2000 and July 2007.
The equity benchmark plunged more than 40 percent after both
all-time highs.  “ Consumer confidence  has tended to lead the turns at the
peak in the last two instances,” Fitzpatrick , Citigroup’s
chief technical analyst wrote in a note dated July 30. “This
suggests that an elevated equity market is not a barrier to a
lower number, but rather that consumer confidence is a leader.”  The confidence index reached 82.1 in June, its highest
level since January 2008. That was the third time the Conference
Board’s gauge formed a peak in the last two decades, according
to a team led by New York-based Fitzpatrick. The measure of
consumer confidence slipped to 80.3 in July.  The confidence index climbed to a record 144.7 in January
2000. The S&P 500 rallied to an all-time high of 1,527.46 in
March of that year before plunging 49 percent through October
2002 as the technology bubble burst. Consumer sentiment peaked
again in July 2007. The gauge of U.S. stocks advanced to a high
of 1,565.15 on Oct. 9, 2007 before tumbling 57 percent through
March 2009 as subprime mortgages provoked a financial crisis.
The S&P 500 climbed above 1,700 for the first time yesterday, a
151 percent rally since March 2009.  The Conference Board’s June high may not signal an imminent
decline for the S&P 500 because the confidence gauge’s level
remains far below its 2000 and 2007 peaks. The last reading “is
certainly not enough to raise concerns” about equities,
according to  Michael Shaoul , chairman of New York-based
Marketfield Asset Management LLC. His firm oversees more than
$11 billion. Shaoul pointed out that the June and July figures
were below the measure’s average level since 1985 of 91.3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
