Poseidon rose against West Texas
Intermediate as other Gulf crudes were mixed versus the domestic
benchmark.  Poseidon gained 60 cents to a 20-cent premium to WTI at
2:15 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  WTI lost ground to European benchmark Brent today on
concern that U.S. economic growth has slowed. When WTI declines
versus Brent, it typically raises the value of U.S. grades that
compete for space in Gulf Coast refineries with foreign crudes
priced against the international benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet and Heavy Louisiana Sweet oil both
gained 15 cents to premiums of $5 a barrel and $4.50 a barrel,
respectively, versus WTI.  Thunder Horse  was unchanged at a premium of $2.50. Southern
Green Canyon and Mars Blend fell 10 cents each to discounts of
60 and 30 cents, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
