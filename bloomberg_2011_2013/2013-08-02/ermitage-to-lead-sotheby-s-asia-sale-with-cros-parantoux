Hermitage La Chapelle wine from the
cellars of Rhone producer Paul Jaboulet Aine dating back to 1949
will lead  Sotheby’s (BID)  sales in Hong Kong next month along with
vintage Burgundies including Romanee-Conti and Cros Parantoux.  Six bottles of Hermitage La Chapelle from 1961 are
estimated to sell for as much as HK$380,000 ($49,000) while a
12-bottle case of Hermitage 1978 is priced to fetch as much as
HK$220,000. Among Burgundies, a 10-bottle lot of Vosne-Romanee
Cros Parantoux 1999 from Henri Jayer carries a top estimate of
HK$360,000, according to an e-mailed Sotheby’s statement.  Older Burgundy vintages from producers such as Romanee-Conti and Jayer have driven demand, while appetite for Bordeaux
has been less consistent. At a Sotheby’s London sale on July 17,
Jayer accounted for the three top lots, all of them going to
Asian buyers.  Jayer prices were “doubling or trebling their estimates,”
Stephen Mould, head of Sotheby’s European wine department, said
after last month’s auction. “The diversity of the sale yet
again shows the interest in wines from a variety of top wine
regions.”  Jayer, who died in 2006, has become one of Burgundy’s most
sought-after wine-makers. His Cros Parantoux, from a 2.5-acre (1
hectare) premier cru vineyard that was an artichoke field in
World War II, has acquired trophy status, with a case of the
1985 vintage fetching as much as HK$2.06 million at a Christie’s
International Plc sale in  Hong Kong  in February 2012.  Romanee-Conti  The Sotheby’s auction on Sept. 7 comes as the Liv-ex Fine
Wine 50 Index of top Bordeaux vintages has risen 4 percent this
year, with declines since mid-March following a gain of 8
percent in the first 10 weeks of the year.  Other lots in the Hong Kong sale include a single bottle of
Romanee-Conti 1990, estimated to fetch as much as HK$140,000,
and a bottle of the 1999 vintage from the same vineyard with an
upper estimate of HK$100,000.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
