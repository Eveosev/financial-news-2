Ambac Assurance Corp.’s segregated
account won court approval to make cash payments of more than of
25 percent of on certain policies, the company said.  The payments will “maximize the cash reimbursements” and
benefit all policyholders, Ambac said today in a statement. The
order was approved in a  Wisconsin  state court, and Ambac expects
the payments will begin this month, it said. Ambac in 2011 had
court approval to pay claimants 25 percent of their losses in
cash.  Ambac Assurance was the second-biggest U.S. bond insurer
before the 2008 financial crisis, after which mounting claims
spurred by mortgage defaults swamped the company with claims and
threatened its viability.  In June 2012, Wisconsin’s insurance commissioner secured
court approval of cash payments to policyholders who had filed
more than $3 billion in claims.  State Insurance Commissioner Theodore Nickel’s office
undertook rehabilitation of a segregated portfolio of Ambac
policies covering as much as $50 billion in mortgage-backed
securities and other corporate liabilities two years ago.  The case is In re Rehabilitation of Segregated Account of
Ambac Assurance Corp., 2010-cv-001576,  Dane County , Wisconsin,
Circuit Court (Madison).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
