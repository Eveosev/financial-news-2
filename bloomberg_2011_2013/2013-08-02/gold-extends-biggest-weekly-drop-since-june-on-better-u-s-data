Gold futures capped the first weekly
decline in a month as better-than-expected U.S. economic data
increased speculation that the  Federal Reserve  may slow the pace
of fiscal stimulus.  Claims for jobless benefits in U.S. fell to a five-year
low, the Labor Department reported yesterday and manufacturing
rose in July at the fastest pace in more than two years, a
private group reported yesterday, while employers added fewer
workers than forecast last month, a report showed today. Prices
have slumped 22 percent this year as the dollar gained 4.3
percent against 10 currencies. The metal also retreated as some
investors lost faith in bullion as a store of value.  “Earlier this week we saw economic data that pointed
towards a recovery, and that coupled with a strong dollar kept
gold under pressure,” Tom Power, a senior commodity broker at
R.J. O’Brien & Associates in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “Today’s data was positive for gold, but not enough
to turn the direction of the market.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.1 percent to
settle at $1,310.50 an ounce at 1:43 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , after dropping as much as 2.2 percent to $1,282.40, the
lowest since July 18. Prices rebounded after payrolls in the
U.S. rose by 162,000, less than estimated, and the jobless rate
dropped to 7.4 percent from 7.6 percent. The precious metal lost
0.9 percent this week, after rallying the previous three weeks.  Bullion more than doubled from 2008 to a record $1,923.70
in September 2011 as the central bank bought more than $2
trillion of debt. The Fed currently buys $85 billion of bonds a
month.  Silver Jumped  Silver futures for September delivery jumped 1.5 percent to
$19.912 an ounce in New York, the biggest gain since July 22,
pushing the precious metal to a 0.7 percent increase for the
week.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery gained 0.5 percent to $1,451.50 an ounce.  Palladium futures for September delivery slipped 0.3
percent to $729.70 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
