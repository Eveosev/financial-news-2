Japanese government bonds declined,
pushing 10-year yields to the highest level in two weeks, after
better-than-forecast U.S. factory activity spurred demand for
higher yielding assets such as stocks.  Benchmark  yields  climbed above 0.8 percent, set for the
biggest gain in a week after ending the past four days at 0.795
percent. Five-year yields reached the highest in more than three
weeks after the Topix index of Japanese shares headed for its
largest two-day advance in a month and Treasury yields yesterday
surged the most since July 5. A report today is forecast to show
U.S. payrolls rose and the jobless rate fell.  “The JGB market started lower after U.S. Treasures sold
off yesterday,” said Satoshi Yamada, the chief quantitative
analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. in Tokyo, one of the 23
primary dealers obliged to bid at Japan’s debt auctions. The
strong stock market also pushed down  Japan ’s bonds, he said,
adding that investors are waiting for today’s payrolls data.  Japan’s 10-year yields rose three basis points to 0.825
percent, the most since July 17, at 11:54 a.m. in Tokyo,
according to Japan Bond Trading Co. The price of the 0.8 percent
note due June 2023 fell 0.274 yen, or 274 yen per 100,000 yen
face amount, to 99.771 yen. Five-year yields gained 2 1/2 basis
points to 0.315 percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year yields have swung from an all-time low of 0.315
percent to as much as 1 percent since the BOJ announced on April
4 that it would double monthly bond purchases.  Bond futures for September delivery slid 0.39 to
143.22 in  Tokyo , while the Topix gained 1.3 percent.  Ten-year  Treasury yields  rose 13 basis points yesterday
after the Institute for Supply Management’s factory index jumped
to 55.4, exceeding the highest projection in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists, from 50.9 in the prior month. Readings
above 50 indicate expansion. Yields were little changed at 2.71
percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
