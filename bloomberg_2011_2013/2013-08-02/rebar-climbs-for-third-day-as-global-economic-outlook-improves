speculation that an improving global economic outlook will boost
demand for the construction material.  Rebar for January delivery rose as much as 0.8 percent to
3,676  yuan  ($600) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange,
the highest price for most active futures since July 26, before
trading at 3,670 yuan at 11:30 a.m. local time. Futures are
little changed this week.  Asian  stocks , including property companies in China, rose
after reports yesterday that factory output from the U.S. to
China and Europe expanded in July, while American jobless claims

President  Mario Draghi  said  interest rates  will probably remain
low for an extended period and the  Federal Reserve  retained its
$85 billion-a-month bond buying program.  “Rebar is driven up by a little more bullish sentiment
about the general economy,” said Huang Huiwen, an analyst at
Shanghai Cifco Futures Co. in Shanghai.  The average  spot price  for rebar fell 0.2 percent to 3,448
yuan a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
