Indonesia ’s 10-year bonds had their
best week in 18 months on speculation yields near the highest
level in more than two years lured investors.  The yield on notes due 2023 exceeded 8 percent earlier in
the week, the level that Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management and
PT Manulife Asset Management said last month offered good value.
Gross domestic product increased 5.81 percent in the three
months through June, the smallest gain since the third quarter
of 2010, official data showed today.  Consumer prices  rose 8.61
percent in July, the most since January 2009, according to
figures released yesterday.  “Slowing growth can help the economy rebalance,” said
Handy Yunianto, head of fixed-income research at PT Mandiri
Sekuritas, a unit of the nation’s largest bank. “Investors were
expecting the worst before the inflation and growth data, so now
the certainty gives some relief to the market.”  The yield on the notes due in 2023 fell 34 basis points, or
0.34 percentage point, from a week ago to 7.62 percent as of
3:40 p.m. in Jakarta, the biggest drop since January 2012, data
from the Inter Dealer Market Association show. The rate, which
has increased 2.43 percentage points this year, declined two
basis points today. It touched 8.3 percent on July 16, the
highest since March 2011.  Inflation probably reached its peak in July after the
government raised subsidized-fuel prices in June, Finance
Minister Chatib Basri said July 20.  Forwards Drop  Exports (IDEXPY)  dropped 4.5 percent in June from a year earlier,
contracting for a 15th straight month, a government report
showed yesterday. Global funds pulled $3.6 billion from the
nation’s stocks and bonds in the three months through July.  Banks including Macquarie Group Ltd. and Credit Suisse
Group AG lowered their rupiah forecasts last month at the
fastest pace since January 2012 after  Bank Indonesia  allowed the
currency to depreciate to more accurately reflect worsening
exports and capital outflows.  Rupiah one-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.6 percent
today, the most since July 24, to 10,445 per dollar, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The contracts traded at a 1.5
percent discount to the spot rate, which declined 0.2 percent
this week and 0.1 percent today to 10,285, according to prices
from local banks.  A  fixing  by the Association of Banks in  Singapore  used to
settle the contracts was set at 10,291 today, from 10,277 on
July 26. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, dropped 42
basis points this week to 12.19 percent, according to data
