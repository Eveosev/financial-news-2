German stocks  were little changed,
with the benchmark gauge heading for a weekly gain, as companies
from Allianz SE to Deutsche Lufthansa AG reported earnings and
as investors awaited U.S. employment data.  Allianz advanced 2.1 percent after posting a 27 percent
growth in second-quarter profit. Axa SA added 3.5 percent after
reporting first-half net income. Fuchs Petrolub SE gained 4.1
percent after second-quarter profit beat estimates. Deutsche
Lufthansa AG slid 4 percent after earnings missed projections.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  added 0.1 percent to 8,421.55 at 9:38 a.m. in
Frankfurt. The equity benchmark has climbed 2.2 percent so far
this week and has risen 9.5 percent from a low on June 24. The
broader HDAX Index increased 0.2 percent today.  A  U.S. payrolls report due at 8:30 a.m. in Washington may
showed employers added 185,000 workers in July, after hiring
195,000 in the previous month, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey. Economists also predicted that the
 unemployment rate  dropped to 7.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
