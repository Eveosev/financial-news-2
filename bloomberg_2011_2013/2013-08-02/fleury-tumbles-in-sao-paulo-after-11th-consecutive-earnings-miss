Fleury SA (FLRY3) , the worst-performing
Brazilian medical services provider this year, fell the most in
six weeks after reporting a profit that trailed analystsâ€™
estimates for an 11th straight quarter.  The shares tumbled 2.3 percent to 19.05 reais at the close
of trading in  Sao Paulo , the steepest drop since June 19. The
BM&FBovespa Small Cap Index, of which Fleury is a  member , lost
1.1 percent.  Fleury posted adjusted  net income  of 22.1 million reais
($9.7 million) in the second quarter, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg after the company released results yesterday. That

by Bloomberg. The Sao Paulo-based company has missed earnings
estimates since 2010, the data show.  Fleury has lost 17 percent this year, while the small-cap
gauge has dropped 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
