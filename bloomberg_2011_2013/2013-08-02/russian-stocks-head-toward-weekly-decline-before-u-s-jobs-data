second weekly loss as investors awaited data that may signal an
increase in jobs in the U.S.  The benchmark  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  fell 0.1 percent, erasing gains,
to 1397.31 at 12:07 p.m. in Moscow, taking this week’s loss to
0.4 percent. United Co. Rusal, the world’s biggest aluminum
company, dropped 4.1 percent. Fertilizer company OAO Acron fell

official U.S. payrolls report is due at 4:30 p.m. Moscow time.  “ Russia  is treading water this morning with very little
turnover ahead of important U.S. jobs data this afternoon,”

wrote in e-mailed comments. “Only performance to really note is
Uralkali rallying, battling back some of this week’s heavy
losses.”  The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  was little changed at
1,331.03. Russia-dedicated equity funds had an outflow of $40
