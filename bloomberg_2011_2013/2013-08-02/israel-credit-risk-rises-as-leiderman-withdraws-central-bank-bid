The cost of protecting Israeli bonds
against default surged to the highest level in two weeks after
Leo Leiderman withdrew his candidacy to become the next  Bank of
Israel  governor, the second nominee to pull out in a week.  Israel’s five-year credit-default swaps rose 0.66 basis
points to 111.66, the highest level since July 15, according to
prices compiled by CMA. The credit risk is set for a 3.66 basis
points increase this week, the biggest since the five days
ending June 21. The shekel was little changed at 3.5633 at 11:07
a.m. in New York.  Leiderman, who is head of the economics department at Bank
Hapoalim Ltd., said he is removing himself from consideration,
according to a text message from Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu ’s office. Leiderman is the second candidate to
withdraw in a week after  Jacob Frenkel  announced he was no
longer in the running. Netanyahu chose Leiderman to succeed
Stanley Fischer on July 31.  “It’s going to take a while to settle this now and it’s
going to lead to a period of uncertainty,”  Daniel Hewitt ,
senior economist at Barclays Plc in London, said in a telephone
interview. “I was really looking forward to him as a governor.
I thought he was just the right person for it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
