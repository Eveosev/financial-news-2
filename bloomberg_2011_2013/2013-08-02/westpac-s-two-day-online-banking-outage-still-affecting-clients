Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) ,  Australia ’s
second-biggest lender by market value, said a two-day outage of
online banking is still affecting some customers as the bank
works to restore full service.  A small number of customers may still be affected during
this process, Supreet Thomas, a spokeswoman for the Sydney-based
bank, said in an e-mailed statement without further detail.
About 3.5 million of its 12 million customers use mobile and
online banking, it said in a filing in May.  Internet-based and mobile banking is the fastest growing
mode of transactions for Australian banks. Westpac’s Australian
Financial Services unit expects the number of online and mobile
payments to rise to more than 83 million a month in 2017 from 43
million last year, it said in a filing in March.  “We take systems reliability extremely seriously and are
very disappointed by the inconvenience to our customers and will
undertake a thorough review,” Harry Wendt, head of Westpac’s
digital financial services, said in today’s e-mailed statement.  Westpac spent A$160 million ($143 million) in the six
months to March 31 on technology and information services,
according to a stock exchange filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
