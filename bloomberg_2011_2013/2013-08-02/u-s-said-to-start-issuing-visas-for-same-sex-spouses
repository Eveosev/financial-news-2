U.S. consulates worldwide will extend
the same visa privileges to same-sex spouses as to other married
couples starting immediately, Secretary of State John Kerry said
today.  The decision applies to spouses of U.S. citizens as well as
non-U.S. citizens. The change resulted from President  Barack Obama ’s order that U.S. government agencies review rules that
discriminated against same-sex couples and might be invalidated
by the Supreme Court’s decision in June to overturn the Defense
of Marriage Act.  “Every married couple will be treated exactly the same”
provided that they were legally married in a jurisdiction where
same-sex marriage is recognized, Kerry told employees in the
consular section of the U.S. embassy in  London , one of 222 U.S.
visa centers worldwide.  Kerry said the Supreme Court decision “tearing down an
unjust and unfair barrier” was “one of those moments where
policy and values join together.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
