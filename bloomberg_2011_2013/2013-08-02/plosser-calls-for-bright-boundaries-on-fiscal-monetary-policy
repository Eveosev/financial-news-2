Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia
President  Charles Plosser  called for creation of a clear
boundary between fiscal and monetary policy, saying Fed
involvement in fiscal matters risks spurring inflation.  “It is simply good governance and wise economic policy to
maintain a healthy separation between those responsible for tax
and spending policy and those responsible for  money creation ,”
Plosser said in an essay accompanying the release of the
Philadelphia Fed’s 2012 annual report.  “The combination of a financial crisis and sustained
fiscal imbalances has led to a substantial breakdown in the
institutional framework and accepted barriers between monetary
and fiscal policy,” Plosser said. “The ability of the central
bank to maintain  price stability  can also be undermined when the
central bank itself ventures into the realm of fiscal policy.”  The  Federal Open Market Committee  this week said it will
keep buying $85 billion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed
securities every month while citing “inflation persistently
below its 2 percent objective.” The Fed, seeking to spur growth
and bring down 7.4 percent unemployment, has expanded its
balance sheet to $3.57 trillion in three rounds of bond
purchases known as quantitative easing.  “When the Fed engages in targeted credit programs that
seek to alter the allocation of credit across markets, I believe
it is engaged in fiscal policy and has breached the traditional
boundaries established between the fiscal authorities and the
central bank,” Plosser said. “It is important to restore the
bright boundaries between fiscal and  monetary policy .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
