Ethanol gained against gasoline after
production of the biofuel tumbled to the lowest level in more
than three months.  The spread, or price difference, tightened 6.58 cents to
77.76 cents a gallon, based on September contracts for the motor
fuel and additive. The most recent Energy Information
Administration report showed  output  plunged a third week in the
period ended July 26 to the least since April 12.  “Production is off more than 5 percent from the month’s
highs,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago.
“There’s a concern about production.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery increased 1.9
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.204 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade. The August contract, which expires Aug. 5, advanced
1.1 cents to $2.30.  Gasoline for September delivery decreased 4.68 cents, or
1.5 percent, to $2.9816 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 91 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool last week, the lowest level since May
31, according to data from the EIA, the Energy Department’s
research arm.  Kitt said ethanol’s discount to gasoline will lift demand
from refiners looking to pocket the difference between the two.  Ethanol, made from corn in the U.S., is blended with
gasoline as part of U.S. plans to reduce dependence on foreign
sources of crude oil.  RINs Prices  Compliance with the law is tracked by Renewable
Identification Numbers, or RINs, which are attached to each
gallon of biofuel and that can be traded among refiners.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  decreased 3 cents yesterday to
$1.06, while  advanced RINs , which cover biodiesel and Brazilian
sugarcane-based ethanol, dropped 4 cents to $1.11.  Corn for September delivery slumped 2.25 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $4.8525 a bushel in  Chicago . The more-actively
traded December contract added 1.75 cents to $4.6875.  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, based on
September contracts for the grain and biofuel, was 44 cents, up
from 42 cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
