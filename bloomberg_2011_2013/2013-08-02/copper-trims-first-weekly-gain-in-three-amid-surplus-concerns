Copper declined, paring the first
weekly advance in three, amid concerns that global supply will
exceed demand as mine output increases and economic growth slows
in  China . Tin dropped.  Copper for delivery in three months fell as much as 0.6
percent to $6,957.75 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
before trading at $6,962.50 as of 11:40 a.m. in  Shanghai . The
contract gained 1.5 percent this week, touching a one-week high
of $7,044 yesterday.  The price is down 12 percent this year on concern that
demand would slow. World supply may outstrip consumption in 2014
for a second year to a five-year high as mine output increases
amid slowing demand from China, according to Pan Pacific Copper
Co.,  Japan ’s top producer. Orders to remove the metal from LME
warehouses, or canceled warrants, dropped to the lowest level
since June 20, bourse data showed yesterday.  The “fundamental picture remains unchanged,” said Xu Liping, an analyst at HNA Topwin Futures Co. in Shanghai.
“Rising supplies and slower growth of Chinese demand compared
with the past decade will continue to weigh on prices.”  The Chinese government signaled last week it will protect
this year’s 7.5 percent growth target, which would be the worst
performance since 1990, after expansion slowed for the second
quarter in a row.  The contract for delivery in November was unchanged at
50,020  yuan  ($8,159) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Metal for delivery in September fell 0.5 percent to $3.1505 a
pound on the Comex in  New York . On the LME, aluminum, zinc,
nickel and lead were little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
