West Texas Intermediate crude pared
its weekly increase after fewer jobs than forecast were added in
the U.S., the world’s largest oil consumer.  Futures dropped as much as 0.7 percent, bringing their gain
this week to 1.9 percent. The 162,000 increase in payrolls last
month was less than the 185,000 estimated and the smallest
advance in four months, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . Brent earlier exceeded $110 for the first time since
April after Libya’s head of oil security quit as labor protests
shut export terminals in the country.  “Disappointing jobs numbers” may trigger “a sharp fall
in oil prices,” Thina Saltvedt, an analyst at Nordea Bank AG in
Oslo, said before the release of the data. “There’s a high
level of speculative money in the oil market and so if sentiment
turns we could see a big turn in prices.”  WTI for September delivery lost as much as 79 cents to
$107.10 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange and was at $107.21 as of 1:41 p.m. London
time. The volume of all futures traded was 17 percent above the
100-day average. The contract climbed 2.8 percent to $107.60
yesterday, the most since July 10 and its highest closing level
since July 19.  Brent for September settlement fell as much as 0.8 percent
to $108.63 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Earlier it advanced as much as 55 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $110.09, topping $110 for the first time since April
3. The European benchmark’s premium to WTI shrank to as little
as $1.26.  To contact the reporters on this story:
