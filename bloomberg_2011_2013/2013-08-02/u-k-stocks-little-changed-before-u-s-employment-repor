this week as a report showed the  U.S. economy , the world’s

 Federal Reserve  said it will maintain its bond-buying program.  “The headlines from the report look disappointing,”
Stewart Richardson, who helps oversee about $100 million at RMG
Wealth Management LLP in London, said by telephone. “It goes
slightly against the grain compared with the other U.S. data we
saw this week. People are reappraising their positions.”  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100 companies

as consumers increase spending, according to the National

2014, compared with predictions in May of 0.9 percent and 1.5
percent, respectively, the institute said today.  RBS Retreats  RBS (RBS)  sank 3.3 percent to 322.5 pence. Britain’s biggest
