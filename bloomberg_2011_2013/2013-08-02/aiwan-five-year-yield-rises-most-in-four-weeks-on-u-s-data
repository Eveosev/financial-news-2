Taiwan ’s bonds fell, pushing the
five-year yield up by the most in almost five months, tracking
Treasuries after better-than-forecast U.S. economic data. The
island’s dollar was little changed.  Jobless claims in the world’s largest economy fell to a
five-year low and manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace in
two years, reports showed yesterday. The yield on 10-year
Treasuries increased 17 basis points this week, while the
premium investors demand to hold the notes over similar-maturity
Taiwanese government debt rose to 122 basis points yesterday,
the highest in two years.  “U.S. economic data has been positive, and that’s been
lifting Treasury yields and subsequently Taiwan’s,” said Allen Chu, a bond trader at  President Securities Corp. (2855)  in Taipei.
“The spread between U.S. and Taiwan yields is widening.
Taiwan’s central bank probably won’t adjust monetary policy
anytime soon as economic fundamentals don’t warrant such a
move.”  The yield on the 0.875 percent government bonds due January
2018 rose eight basis points to 1.17 percent in Taipei, the
biggest increase for benchmark  five-year  yields since March 11,
according to Gretai Securities Market. The rate advanced 10
basis points this week.  U.S. jobless claims declined to 326,000 in the week ended
July 26 from 345,000 in the previous period, while the  Institute
for Supply Management ’s factory index jumped to 55.4 in July
from 50.9 the prior month.  Currency, Volatility  The  Taiwan dollar  was little changed at NT$30.129 against
its U.S. counterpart, Taipei Forex Inc. prices show. The
currency was trading 0.4 percent stronger seven minutes before
the 4 p.m. close. The central bank has sold the island’s dollar
in the run-up to the close on most days in the past year,
according to traders who asked not to be identified.  One-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.1 percent to
NT$30.024 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, dropped three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.83 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.386
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporters on this story:
