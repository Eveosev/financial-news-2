The euro dropped from the highest
level against the dollar since November as European Central Bank
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  dimmed the prospect of a boost in
borrowing costs when he said inflation risks are balanced.  The dollar gained this week for the first time in almost a
month versus the yen after the U.S.  unemployment rate  fell to
the lowest level since April 2009 even as winter storms
depressed payroll growth. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke will testify on jobs before the House Budget Committee
next week. Australia’s currency rose versus all of its major
counterparts as the central bank raised its growth forecast.  Trichet’s stance “was not what the market had anticipated,
so yields came off a bit and the euro came off commensurately,”
said  Robert Lynch , head of currency strategy at HSBC Holdings
Plc in  New York . “Now you have a scenario in the U.S. where the
markets are rethinking how to price rates following the big drop
in the unemployment rate.”  The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.3581 yesterday, from
$1.3611 on Jan. 28, after touching $1.3862 on Feb. 2, the
highest level since Nov. 9. The euro was little changed at
111.62 yen, compared with 111.77. The dollar increased 0.1
percent to 82.18 yen, from 82.12.    Israel ’s shekel was the biggest loser against the dollar
among Mideast currencies, depreciating 0.6 percent to 3.7196 as
Egyptian protesters proclaimed yesterday the “day of
departure” for President  Hosni Mubarak . Egypt’s stock market
and banking system remained closed amid anti-government
demonstrations.  Jordan’s Dinar  Jordan’s dinar was little changed at 0.7074 as  King Abdullah  asked former Primary Minister Marouf Al Bakhit to form
a new government following street protests.  Canada’s dollar touched the highest level since May 2008 as
employers added more than four times the jobs economists
predicted, encouraging speculation that the Bank of  Canada  will
resume increasing  interest rates .  The Canadian dollar appreciated 1.4 percent to 98.73 cents
versus the greenback from C$1.0013 Jan. 28. It touched 98.32
cents, the strongest level since in more than two years.    Statistics Canada  reported that employment rose by 69,200,
compared with the median forecast of 15,000 in a Bloomberg News
survey of 26 economists. The jobless rate rose to 7.8 percent
from 7.6 percent. Full-time employment rose by 31,100 in
January, and part-time jobs increased by 38,000.  ‘Blowout Number’  “It’s a blowout number,” said C.J. Gavsie, managing
director for foreign-exchange trading at Bank of Montreal in
Toronto. “What we need to see is this part-time significant
increase move more into the full-time area.”  U.S. unemployment unexpectedly dropped to 9 percent last
month from 9.4 percent in December, the Labor Department said
yesterday in  Washington . Employers added 36,000 workers, the
smallest gain in four months, after a 121,000 gain that was
larger than initially reported.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on Feb. 3 in a speech in
Washington that the U.S. needs to see faster job growth for a
sufficient time before policy makers can be assured the economic
recovery has taken hold.  The greenback tumbled 2.3 percent versus the euro in
January as the Fed maintained plans to buy $600 billion of
Treasuries through June, indicating the accelerating recovery
still needs stimulus to produce a bigger drop in unemployment.  The 17-nation euro fell 1.3 percent versus the dollar on
Feb. 3, the most in 10 weeks, as Trichet said inflation has been
prompted “mainly” by rising energy and commodity costs.  ‘Hobbling the Euro’  “Trichet basically ruled out a rate increase this year,
hobbling the euro,” said  Andrew Wilkinson , senior market
analyst at Interactive Brokers Group LLC in Greenwich,  Connecticut .  The euro gained 1.8 percent versus the dollar on Jan. 13,
when Trichet said he’s prepared to raise interest rates if
needed to contain inflation.  Inflation in the euro region accelerated in January to a
2.4 percent annual rate, the fastest since October 2008, the
European Union’s statistics office said in a preliminary
estimate on Jan. 31.  European Union leaders met in Brussels yesterday to try to
narrow differences on ending the region’s debt crisis.  The Australian dollar rallied 2 percent to $1.0138, the
biggest gain in two months, after the  Reserve Bank  of  Australia 
increased its growth forecast for 2011 to 4.25 percent from a
previous prediction of 3.75 percent.  The yen fell the most against the dollar since Jan. 7 as
the yield difference between government debt in the U.S. and
Japan made dollar-denominated assets more attractive.  A drop in Treasuries pushed 10-year note yields up 31 basis
points to 3.64 percent after touching 3.66 percent, the highest
level since May 4. Yields on Japanese 10-year debt rose seven
basis points to 1.29 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
