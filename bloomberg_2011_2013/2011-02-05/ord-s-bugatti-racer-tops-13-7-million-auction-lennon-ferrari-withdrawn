An English lord’s 1930s Bugatti Grand
Prix racer was the top lot in a Paris auction that raised 10.1
million euros ($13.7 million).  The 1933 Bugatti Type 51, entered from the estate of the
late Fitzroy Somerset, the 5th Baron Raglan, fetched 943,000
euros including fees on Feb. 5. The Bonhams sale at the  Grand
Palais  had been scheduled to include a 1965 light blue Ferrari
330 GT 2+2 Coupe, estimated to raise as much as 170,000 euros,
that Beatle  John Lennon  bought hours after passing his driving
test. It was withdrawn before the event owing to “consignor’s
remorse,” said Leonora Oldfield, a press officer at the auction
house: The present seller could not bear to part with it.  The Bugatti had been estimated to raise as much as 800,000
euros. It was bought by a French private collector in the
salesroom, Oldfield said in an interview after the event. The
French-manufactured racer was one of 53 successful lots in an
offering of 90 cars. The sale, including memorabilia, had a low
estimate of 13.7 million euros at hammer prices.  Buyers of collectors’ vehicles have become more selective,
as at the Bonhams auction. The Historic Automobile Group
International (HAGI) Top 50  index  of exceptional classic-car
prices was up 6.6 percent in 2010, lower than its average annual
growth of more than 12 percent from 2003 to 2008. This year, two
investment companies -- Guernsey-based IGA Automobile LP and the
Liechtenstein-based Classic Car Fund -- have issued prospectuses
with target returns of 15 percent and 17 percent respectively.  Sicilian Crash  The Bugatti was likely to have been a works model that
raced in the 1933 Belgian and Dieppe grands prix before crashing
in the 1934 Targa Florio road race in Sicily, according to the
catalog.  The damaged Type 51 was acquired in 1979 by Raglan, a
patron of the U.K. Bugatti Owners’ Club, and took more than two
years to restore. It was then raced at various events around the
world for almost three decades, said the London-based auction
house.  A 1930 Bugatti Type 46 Cabriolet, also formerly owned by
Raglan, sold for 333,500 euros to another French collector. A
1960s Porsche Type 906 Carrera competition coupe also attracted
demand, reaching 747,500 euros -- the second-highest price of
the evening -- against a valuation of 600,000 euros to 700,000
euros.  King’s Aston  A 1955  Aston Martin  DB2/4 Sports Saloon that had been owned
by Baudouin, the king of  Belgium , sold for 333,500 euros against
a high estimate of 240,000 euros. The price was an auction
record for the model, said Bonhams.  King Baudouin, who reigned from 1951 until his death in
1993, was known for his love of fast cars. The Aston Martin,
supplied new to the monarch, was “an expensive car designed to
cater for the connoisseur of  sports cars  who is not limited by
financial considerations,” said Autocar magazine in 1953. The
DB2/4 was in “concours” condition following a restoration
between 2001 and 2008, according to the auction house.  Bonhams’s  most highly valued lot was a Scuderia Ferrari
1930 Alfa Romeo 6C 1750 Gran Sport Spyder that Luigi Scarfiotti
drove in  Italy ’s Mille Miglia (1,000 Mile) road race. Entered by
a Texas-based collector, it failed to attract any bids after
being estimated at 950,000 euros to 1.25 million euros.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
