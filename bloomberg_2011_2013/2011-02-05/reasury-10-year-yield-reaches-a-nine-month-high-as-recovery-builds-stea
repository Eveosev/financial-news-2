Treasuries tumbled, pushing 10-year
yields to the highest since May, as an unexpected drop in the
jobless rate and data showing growth by factories and service
industries fueled bets the economic recovery is gaining steam.  Thirty-year yields had the biggest weekly increase since
October as manufacturing also accelerated in Europe and  China ,
making higher-yielding assets more attractive. The gap between
U.S. 2- and 10-year yields reached the widest in almost a year
as U.S. employers added jobs for a fourth month. The Treasury
will auction $72 billion in notes and bonds next week.  “In context with the other data we’ve seen, the employment
number is consistent with the idea of recovery -- net net, it’s
taken as a bearish signal,” said  Carl Lantz , head of interest-
rate strategy in New York at Credit Suisse Group AG, one of 20
primary dealers that trade with the  Federal Reserve . “The market
probably won’t be able to catch its breath until we get through
the auction process. Demand will be fairly strong.”  The benchmark 10-year note yield climbed 31 basis points to
3.63 percent yesterday in  New York , from 3.32 percent on Jan.
28, according to BGCantor Market Data. It was the biggest weekly
gain since Dec. 10. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. The
yield touched 3.66 percent yesterday, the highest since May 4.  The price of the 2.625 percent security maturing in
November 2020 dropped 2 15/32, or $24.69 per $1,000 face amount,
to 91 3/4.  Thirty-year bond yields advanced 20 basis points to 4.73
percent, the biggest jump since the five days ended Oct. 15.
They touched 4.74 percent yesterday, the highest level since
April 15. Two-year yields increased 21 basis points to reach
0.74 percent in the biggest rise since June 5, 2009.  Yield Spread  The yield gap between 2- and 10-year Treasuries widened to
as much as 291 basis points, the most since Feb. 23, 2010.  Treasuries fell yesterday as the jobless rate decreased for
a second month, Labor Department data showed. A Bloomberg survey
had forecast it would rise to 9.5 percent, from 9.4 percent in
December. Employers added 36,000 jobs, less than predicted, as
storms swept the nation. It was the smallest increase in four
months, the data showed.  “The weather distortions are so great that it’s hard to
really extract any information about the strength of the labor
market,” Gary Pollack, who helps oversee $12 billion as head of
fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank AG’s Private Wealth
Management unit in New York, said yesterday.  Growth in Services  The jobs report came a day after data from the  Institute
for Supply Management  showed U.S. service industries, which
account for 90 percent of the  U.S. economy , grew in January at
the fastest pace since 2005. The ISM’s index of non-
manufacturing businesses rose to 59.4, from December’s 57.1, the
Tempe, Arizona-based group said.  A separate ISM factory index for the U.S. increased last
month the most since 2004, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said
on Feb. 1. Manufacturing in the 17-nation euro region, the U.K.
and China also expanded, other reports that day showed.  Treasuries have lost 1.2 percent this year, according the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch Treasury Master index. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has gained 4.2 percent.  “The overall tone of economic data has been positive, and
the market has been acknowledging that,” said Thomas Simons, a
government-debt economist in New York at primary dealer
Jefferies Group Inc. “It’s still not a tremendously satisfying
pace of recovery, but things are moving right along.”  Not Enough Growth  The Fed is unlikely to raise  interest rates  for at least 12
months because the U.S. economy isn’t generating enough growth
to lower unemployment, Pacific Investment Management Co.’sBill Gross said yesterday in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .  The central bank would probably like to see the economy
adding at least 200,000 jobs a month before considering rate
increases, said  Newport Beach , California-based Gross, manager
of the world’s biggest bond fund. Policy makers have held the
benchmark interest rate near zero since December 2008.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in a speech on Feb. 3 in  Washington  the nation needs to see faster job growth for a
sufficient time before policy makers can be assured the economic
recovery has taken hold.  The central bank bought $27.8 billion in  U.S. debt  this
week, part of a $600 billion program to spur the economy. While
Bernanke said in his speech that growth will pick up this year
and the Fed’s purchases of Treasuries are “providing
significant support to  job creation  and the economy,” he gave
no indication whether he’ll maintain or adjust monetary stimulus
after the asset buying-program ends in June.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the securities, widened to
2.36 percentage points from a 2010 low of 1.47 in August.  The Treasury will auction $32 billion of 3-year notes, $24
billion of 10-year debt and $16 billion of 30-year bonds next
week in daily sales that begin Feb. 8.  To contact the reporters on this story:
