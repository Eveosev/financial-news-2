Eoin Morgan will miss the  England 
cricket teamâ€™s final one-day international in Australia tomorrow
with a broken middle finger on his left hand.  Morgan felt discomfort earlier in the seven-game series
which has gotten progressively worse and an X-ray revealed the
break, the England and Wales Cricket Board said in a statement.  The 24-year-old batsman will return to the U.K. to see a
specialist. A decision will then be made on his participation in
the World Cup, which will be played Feb. 19 to April 2 in India,
Bangladesh and  Sri Lanka , the England board said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
