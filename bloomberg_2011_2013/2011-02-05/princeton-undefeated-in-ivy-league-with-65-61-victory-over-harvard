Ian Hummer and Dan Mavraides each hit
two free throws in the final 13 seconds to seal a 65-61 victory
for Princeton University and handing  Harvard University  its
first loss in college basketball’s Ivy League.  The victory elevated the Tigers (15-4) to 3-0 in the Ivy
League to tie the University of Pennsylvania (9-8), which
defeated Dartmouth College (5-14, 1-4) 78-47. Harvard (15-4),
which is the oldest college in the U.S. and is seeking its first
basketball title in more than a century, dropped to 4-1.  Hummer led the Tigers with 17 points while Mavraides added
15 tonight at L. Stockwell Jadwin Gymnasium in Princeton,  New
Jersey .  Harvard had a 30-29 lead at halftime. Princeton outscored
the Crimson 36-31 in the second half.  Keith Wright led the Crimson with 16 points and 11
rebounds. Christian Webster added 15 points.  In other  Ivy League  contests, Yale University (10-9, 3-2)
beat Cornell University (4-15, 0-5) 71-70 and Brown University
(8-11, 1-4) defeated  Columbia University  (12-7, 3-2) 87-79.  Harvard, established in 1636, started a men’s basketball
team in 1900-01, and didn’t field squads from 1909 to 1920. Its
best start was in 1945-46, when it was 19-3 and went to the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.  Since then, its best Ivy finish was second place with an
11-3 league record in 1970-71, and they finished third last
season.  In the  54 years  the Ivy League has been naming a men’s
basketball champion, Princeton and Philadelphia-based Penn have
each won at least a share of the title 25 times, followed by
Cornell in Ithaca, New York, and Yale, in  New Haven ,
Connecticut, with four each; Dartmouth in Hanover, New
Hampshire, with two; and Brown in Providence, Rhode Island, and
Columbia in  New York  City with one apiece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
