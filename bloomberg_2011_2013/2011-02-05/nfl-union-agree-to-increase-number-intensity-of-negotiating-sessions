The  National Football League  and its
players union have agreed to “increase the number, length and
intensity of bargaining sessions” in an attempt to reach a new
labor deal before the old one expires in March.  The leaders of the U.S.’s most-watched television sport and
the NFL Players Association met for two hours today “in a
continuing effort to narrow the differences and reach a fair
agreement that will benefit the players, teams and fans,” they
said in a joint statement.  NFL owners voted in 2008 to opt out of the collective
bargaining agreement after this season, saying the deal didn’t
account for costs such as those of building stadiums. Talks have
included topics such as what share of revenue players should get,
expanding the regular season to 18 games from 16, a rookie
salary cap and health care.  To contact the reporter on this story:
