Newcastle made a late bid to sign  Thierry Henry  as the replacement for Andy Carroll, the  Daily
Express  said.  Carroll joined Liverpool five days ago, hours before the
end of the January transfer period. The move left Newcastle
looking for temporary signings and the club approached Henryâ€™s
agent, the Express said.  Henry, 33, has recently been training with former club
Arsenal in preparation for the start of the Major League Soccer
season next month. Newcastle was prepared to pay him a six-
figure weekly salary to accept a short-term contract but the
striker is committed to joining the New York Red Bulls for
preseason training in Mexico, the Express said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
