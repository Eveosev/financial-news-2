U.S. stocks gained this week, pushing
the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  to its first close above 12,000
since June 2008, as corporate earnings, an expansion of American
and Chinese manufacturing and an unexpected decrease in the  unemployment rate  overshadowed unrest in Egypt.    Alcoa Inc . surged 6.3 percent and Cisco Systems Inc. rose
5.4 percent to help lead gains in the Dow after data from the
U.S. and  China  reinforced forecasts the economic recovery will
strengthen in 2011. Pfizer Inc. and  Exxon Mobil Corp . posted
weekly gains exceeding 5.4 percent after reporting profit that
beat analyst estimates. Massey Energy Co. jumped 9 percent after
Alpha Natural Resources Inc. agreed to buy the coal producer.  The Dow gained 268.45 points, or 2.3 percent, to 12,092.15
this week, rallying for five straight days in its longest streak
since November. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 2.7
percent to 1,310.87, passing 1,300 for the first time since
August 2008.  “The economic data and the corporate profit data has been
strong, and has been pushing the market higher,” said Jeremy Zirin, who helps manage about $461 billion as chief equity
strategist at UBS Wealth Management in  New York . “The focus
really shifted from the known problems in  Egypt  to the economic
data, and the good set of reports that supported the notion that
we are moving from a recovery to an expansion.”  Most Since 1936  The S&P 500 has risen 94 percent from its March 2009 low,
the biggest rally over equivalent time periods since 1936,
according to  Howard Silverblatt , a New York-based index analyst
at S&P. The index erased its Jan. 28 slump driven by Egyptian
riots after company earnings and positive economic data from the
U.S. and China. More than 73 percent of the 287 companies in the
S&P 500 that have reported results since Jan. 10 topped
earnings-per-share projections, according to Bloomberg data.  The gauge has risen 4.2 percent this year, extending a 13
percent advance in 2010, following government stimulus measures,
higher-than-estimated corporate profits and increased confidence
that growth in the U.S. and  Europe  will underpin the global
expansion.  Commodity producers rose the most among 10 S&P 500 groups
this week, rallying 4.6 percent. Copper rose to a record on
mounting concern that the global economic recovery will boost
consumption of the metal used in cars, homes and appliances
while mining companies struggle to increase output.  China’s manufacturing expanded last month, according to
data from the country’s logistics federation, while the  Institute for Supply Management ’s index for U.S. factory output
rose to 60.8, exceeding the most optimistic forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists and the highest since 2004.  Alcoa, Cisco  Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, increased 6.3
percent to $17.14.  Cisco, which reports second-quarter earnings next week,
climbed 5.4 percent to $22.05.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc . telecom
equipment analyst Simona Jankowski said the largest provider of
computer networking gear will give a better-than-projected
forecast for its third quarter, citing strong business spending.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said its
business barometer rose to 68.8 this month. Figures greater than
50 signal expansion. Economists forecast the gauge would slip to
64.5, based on the median projection in a Bloomberg News survey.
The U.S. jobless rate unexpectedly fell to 9 percent in January,
the lowest level since April 2009, while payrolls rose less than
forecast, depressed by winter storms.  Pfizer climbed 6.3 percent, the biggest gain in the Dow, to
$19.30. Profit excluding one-time items was 47 cents a share,
beating the 46-cent average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  ‘Good Job’  “Companies continue to do a good job at growing their
revenues and their earnings,” said Oliver Pursche, co-manager
of the GMG Defensive Beta Fund and president of Suffern, New
York-based Gary Goldberg Financial Services, which manages about
$500 million. “All of this, the continued rise in profits and
the continued strength in manufacturing, indicates to us that
we’re on track in terms of the recovery.”  An index of energy shares had the second-biggest gain in
the  S&P 500 , rising 4.2 percent as  Brent crude , the benchmark
grade for two-thirds of the world oil market, exceeded $100 a
barrel for the first time since 2008.  Exxon, the world’s largest company by market value, climbed
5.4 percent to $83.28 after posting its fourth consecutive
quarterly profit increase as burgeoning energy demand boosted
oil and fuel prices. Fourth-quarter earnings of $1.85 a share
excluding some items beat the average analyst projection by 13
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.    Barton Biggs   Massey jumped 9 percent to $62.40 after Alpha Natural
Resources agreed to buy the coal producer for $7.1 billion in a
takeover that will create the world’s third-largest producer of
coal used to make steel at a time when prices are surging.  Barton Biggs, who recommended buying U.S. stocks when the
S&P 500 started rallying in 2009, said riots in Egypt are no
reason to sell.  “I’m not selling, and I’m not panicked by these events in
Egypt and the Middle East,” Biggs, 78, who runs New York-based
hedge fund Traxis Partners LP, said in a Jan. 31 Bloomberg
Television interview on “Surveillance Midday” with  Tom Keene .
“The ongoing economic data is very encouraging.”  The  Market Vectors Egypt Index ETF , an exchange-traded fund
that holds Egyptian shares, climbed 10 percent for its biggest
weekly gain since inception a year ago. The ETF fell 0.3 percent
yesterday as Egyptians poured out of prayer services and filled
Cairo’s Tahrir Square on what demonstrators called the “day of
departure” for President  Hosni Mubarak . Other Arab countries
gripped by instability include Yemen, Jordan and  Tunisia .  JDS Uniphase, Homebuilders    JDS Uniphase Corp . rose the most in the S&P 500, surging 35
to $22.76. The computer-networking company beat analysts’
projections for per-share second-quarter earnings excluding some
items by 49 percent. Third-quarter revenue will be $440 million
to $460 million, compared with the average analyst estimate of
$420.9 million.  Homebuilders declined after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
investors should avoid the shares because expectations for
housing growth in 2012 are too high. D.R. Horton Inc. slumped
6.2 percent to $11.73, while  Toll Brothers Inc . declined 2.2
percent to $20. PulteGroup Inc., the largest U.S. homebuilder by
revenue, plunged 6.7 percent to $7.54 after reporting a fourth-
quarter loss that was four times bigger than analysts estimated
as sales fell.  To contact the reporters on this story:
