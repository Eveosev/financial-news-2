The  Cleveland Cavaliers  will set a
National Basketball Association losing-streak record if they
tally their 24th straight loss tonight as host to the Portland
Trail Blazers.  The Cavaliers tied the record last night when they lost
their 23rd consecutive game, 112-105, to the Memphis Grizzles.  Zach Randolph had 29 points and 13 rebounds for the
Grizzlies (27-24), while Rudy Gay added 26 points and 11
rebounds at FedEx Forum in Memphis.  Memphis rallied from a 59-52 halftime deficit to outscore
Cleveland 60-46 in the second half.  J.J. Hickson scored a game-high 31 points and grabbed 15
rebounds for the Cavaliers. Ramon Sessions had 20 points.  The Cavaliers, 8-42, havenâ€™t won since Dec. 18, an overtime
victory on the road against the  New York Knicks . The 23-game
slide, which includes 15 losses of 10 or more points, ties the
record for a single season set by the 1995-96 Grizzlies and
matched by the 1997-98  Denver Nuggets .  Last season, seven-time All-Star forward LeBron James led
the Cavaliers to the Eastern Conference semifinals for the fifth
straight season. James, a native of Akron, Ohio, became a free
agent during the offseason and in July declined to re-sign with
the Cavaliers, instead joining Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh with
the  Miami Heat .  James returned to Cleveland on Dec. 2 and scored a game-
high 38 points in the 118-90 Miami victory. Since that loss, the
Cavaliers are 1-31, and they sit 27 games behind the  Chicago
Bulls  in the Eastern Conference Central division.  The Cavaliers also have lost a franchise-record 24
consecutive road games, 19 shy of the NBA record set by the  Sacramento Kings  from November 1990 to November 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
