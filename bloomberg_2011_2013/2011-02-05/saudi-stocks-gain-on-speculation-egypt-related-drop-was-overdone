Saudi Arabian equities rose for a
third day after U.S. and European stocks advanced last week and
on speculation that declines related to the political upheaval
in Egypt left shares at attractive prices.  The  Tadawul All Share Index  increased 0.3 percent to
6,531.28 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh, bringing the three-
day gain to 2.7 percent.  Al Rajhi Bank , the kingdom’s largest
publicly-traded lender by market value, gained for a second day
and  Etihad Etisalat Co ., the second-largest phone company,
advanced 1.9 percent.  “Global sentiment is improving as international investors
continue to embrace risk on attractive valuations and positive
economic data,” said Amro Halwani, a trader at  Shuaa Capital
PSC  in Riyadh. “The correlation between international and
regional markets is returning as investors buy back into
depressed shares.”  The index fell 5.2 percent from the close on Jan. 24
through Feb. 1 and fetched 1.9 times net assets, the cheapest
level relative to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index since
Bloomberg began compiling the monthly data in April 2006. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 2.7 percent and the
benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 1.9 percent last week
as corporate earnings and expansion of American and Chinese
manufacturing overshadowed unrest in  Egypt .  Egyptian Protests  Hundreds of thousands of protesters have been demonstrating
in Cairo and other cities for more than 10 days, calling for the
resignation of President Hosni Mubarak. Yesterday’s ‘Day of
Departure’ ended with the 82-year-old president still in power.
Egyptian banks will open tomorrow, while the bourse will remain

Etisalat rose 1.9 percent to 53.75 riyals.  Banque Saudi Fransi

in the region emerges,” said Shuaa’s Halwani.    Saudi Arabia ’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
