  France  suspended shipments of arms
and riot-police equipment including tear gas to  Egypt  after the
start of unrest in the country, according to a French government
official.  The weapons export restrictions were decided by Prime
Minister Francois Fillon’s office on Jan. 27, said the official,
who confirmed a report on the website of  Le Monde  newspaper and
declined to be named, citing government policy. Export permits
for material such as tear gas were suspended by customs
authorities Jan. 25, the official said.  Egyptian authorities and opposition leaders have begun
talks on ending President  Hosni Mubarak ’s 30 years in power
before September elections as protests demanding his exit
extended into a 12th day.  France’s opposition and commentators have criticized
President Nicolas Sarkozy’s government for being slow to drop
its support for ousted Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben
Ali, who fled that country Jan. 14.  French Foreign Minister Michele Alliot-Marie came under
pressure from the opposition to resign after suggesting in
parliament Jan. 12 that the country could offer Tunisia police
expertise on non-lethal crowd control and for accepting a ride
in December in a jet owned by a Tunisian businessman during a
holiday in the north African country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
