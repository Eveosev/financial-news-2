The  International Cricket Council  has
suspended three Pakistan cricketers for violating the sport’s
anti-corruption code,  Agence France-Presse  reported.  Former captain Salman Butt was banned for 10 years,
Mohammad Asif for 7 years and Mohammad Amir for 5 years, AFP
reported following a tribunal hearing in Doha, Qatar.  The players were given a temporary ban after being charged
with offenses under cricket’s anti-corruption code. They were
questioned by police in August and had their mobile phones taken
after the News of the World newspaper made allegations of a
betting scam during the fourth Test against England in London.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
