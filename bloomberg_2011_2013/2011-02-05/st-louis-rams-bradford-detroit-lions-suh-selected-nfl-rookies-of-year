St. Louis Rams quarterback  Sam Bradford  and Detroit Lions defensive tackle  Ndamukong Suh , the
top two picks in the 2010 draft, were chosen the  National
Football League ’s rookies of the year.  Bradford, offensive rookie of the year, directed the Rams
to a 7-9 record a year after the team was 1-15 in the National
Football Conference West. Suh, the No. 2 draft selection, helped
the Lions end the season with a four-game winning streak.  Bradford, 23, set NFL rookie records with 354 pass
completions and 590 attempts and claimed second place in passing
with 3,512 yards behind Indianapolis Colts quarterback  Peyton Manning , who had 3,739 in 1998. He was the top pick in the draft.  “There’s been some ups, there’s been some downs, but I
feel like for the most part I’ve learned from my mistakes each
week,” Bradford told the  Associated Press . “I really still
have a long way to go before I’m as comfortable as I want to
be.”  Suh, 24, had 10 sacks for the Lions, who ranked sixth in
the NFL with 44 sacks. He became the seventh rookie in team
history to win the award, the most by any franchise since 1967.  “It is a great honor and one of the highest honors I can
receive on the defensive side of the ball,” Suh said in a
statement.  Bradford received 44 of 50 votes cast by media
representatives who regularly cover the NFL. Suh was named on 48
ballots that were counted by AP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
