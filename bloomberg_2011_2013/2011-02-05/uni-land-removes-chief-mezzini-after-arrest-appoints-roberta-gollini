  Uni Land SpA , an Italian real estate
developer, said it ousted General Manager Alberto Mezzini after
he was arrested in an insider trading and market manipulation
probe, and replaced him with Roberta Gollini.  Uni Land also ousted Claudio Morsenchio as chief financial
officer and Maurizio Zuffa as chief executive officer of its  House Building SpA  unit, the company said in a statement late
yesterday. Bologna, Italy-based prosecutors allege the managers
misled investors about transactions and the value of properties,
falsely pumping up shareholder equity by about 200 million euros
($272 million), Uni Land said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
