Greek bonds climbed for the first
week in three, leading a gain in government debt from  Europe ’s
high-deficit countries, amid growing confidence that officials
are moving closer to a solution to the region’s debt crisis.  Yields on Greek 10-year bonds slid to the lowest in three
months. European leaders met in Brussels yesterday to focus on
ways to reinforce a bailout fund, reduce rates on emergency aid
and set up a permanent rescue mechanism. German two-year notes
fell for the first week in five as investors bet the  European
Central Bank  will raise  interest rates , even as President Jean-
Claude Trichet sought to damp the speculation.  “They have a lot of financial ammunition if they choose to
fire it, and they’re now beginning to put that in place,” said
Robin Marshall, director of fixed income at London-based Smith &
Williamson Investment Management, said of European policy
makers. “Now the European Financial Stability Facility looks
like it will be upgraded. It’s quite possible these spreads
could go a little further.”  The yield on the Greek 10-year bond fell 57 basis points in
the week to 10.89 percent at 4:30 p.m. in  London . The price of
the 6.25 percent securities maturing in June 2020 rose 2.625, or
26.25 euros per 1,000 euro ($1,356) face amount, to 73.46. The
difference in yield between the Greek securities and German
bunds narrowed 60 basis points to 7.71 percentage points.  Spanish 10-year bonds also rose, with the yield falling 26
basis points to 5.19 percent. The yield on Irish bonds of a
similar maturity declined 30 basis points to 8.86 percent. The
Italian yield slid 16 basis points to 4.62 percent.  Confidence Tested  Greek bonds have returned 6.2 percent in 2011 amid growing
confidence that French and German policy makers will resolve
differences over the EFSF. Greek securities have lost about 12
percent in the past year, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies.    Germany  seems to be working to a timetable of late
March,” said Marshall. “I’m not sure we’ll be able to go
another six or seven weeks without the market pressures
building.”  Investor confidence in the so-called peripheral economies
will be tested next week as  Portugal ,  Greece ,  Belgium  and  Italy 
all auction bills.  German government debt yields posted a weekly gain after
data showed inflation in euro-region countries accelerated to a
two-year high, even as Trichet said current rates are
“appropriate” and inflationary pressures “should remain
contained.”  The yield on German 10-year bunds, Europe’s benchmark
government debt securities, rose seven basis points to 3.22
percent this week. It reached 3.26 percent, the highest in
nearly a year, on February 3. The 2.5 percent security due
January 2021 fell 0.540, or 5.40 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 94.000.  The two-year yield was little changed at 1.36 percent,
after rising to 1.50 percent on the same day. That’s the most in
nearly 18 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
