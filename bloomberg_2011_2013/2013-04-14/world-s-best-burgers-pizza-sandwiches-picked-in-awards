The hunt is on for the world’s finest burgers, pizzas and other everyday treats as the nominees are announced today for a new set of awards that honor humble foods rather than the peaks of gastronomy.  Chowzter  World’s Seven Tastiest Fast Feasts Awards is backed by  Coca-Cola Co (KO) . It also seeks to identify the best fried chicken, tacos, dumplings & empanadas, curry and sandwiches.  The 12 nominees in each category stretch from Caracas to Beijing, not to mention Lucky Chip, Royal  China , Spuntino, Story Deli, Rita’s, Poppies,  Kappacasein  and Taqueria in  London . New York nominees include Tortilleria Nixtamal, White Bear and  Ben’s Best .  Writers, restaurateurs and chefs -- including Giles Coren,  Russell Norman  and Pierre Koffmann -- have agreed to present prizes at the inaugural award ceremony in London on April 28. The winners have been selected from about 5,000 contenders selected by a team of food bloggers from more than 30 cities.  “It’s the first time that serious foodies have systematically attempted to find the tastiest, locally sourced and freshly prepared dishes in the world,” Chowzter founder and chief executive Jeffrey Merrihue said in a telephone interview.  The Chowzter event comes one night before the  World’s 50 Best Restaurants  awards, when  Alain Ducasse  will be honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award, the organizers said today.  “We are delighted that this prestigious accolade is going to one of the greatest chefs in  France  and, indeed, the world,” William Drew, editor of Restaurant magazine and organizer of the World’s 50 Best, said in an e-mailed release.  The full list of Chowzter nominees will be published on the website  http://www.chowzter.com/awards , where tickets are on sale. Here are the nominations for best pizza and hamburgers.
