Cordiant Capital Inc., a Montreal-
based  money manager , raised $250 million to invest in emerging
market loans as it seeks to replace European and American banks
that have cut lending.  The fund, known as Cordiant Emerging Loan Fund IV, will
offer senior secured loans to private-sector borrowers,
according to an e-mailed statement. Initial investors include
insurers, pension and sovereign wealth funds.  The reduction in lending by western banks has pushed up
 interest rates  for emerging market loans, David Creighton,
Cordiant’s chief executive officer, said in the statement. “Our
fund gives investors low-cost access to that opportunity without
the volatility inherent in a competing asset class like emerging
market bonds.”  Bank lending to  emerging markets  fell 20 percent in 2012 to
$276 billion, Cordiant said in an April 8 statement. A boom in
emerging-market bonds hasn’t benefited the majority of companies
in such countries because they remain dependent on bank lending,
it said.  Emerging market loans pay interest margins at least 200
basis points, or 2 percentage points, higher than before 2008,
Cordiant said. It expects the fund to achieve an all-in spread
of 450 basis points to 650 basis points more than the  London 
interbank offered rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
