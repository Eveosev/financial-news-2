Senator Marco Rubio said today that
the immigration plan currently being negotiated in the  U.S.
Congress  would make the border more secure than it’s ever been.  “We are going to get the toughest enforcement measures in
the history of this country,” Rubio, a Florida Republican, said
on ABC’s “This Week.”  Rubio, a potential Republican presidential candidate in
2016, said senators have agreed on having a system that lets
employers confirm if a person is eligible to work.  “You will not be able to find a job in the  United States 
if you are illegally here,” Rubio said.  Rubio also said he opposes a Senate compromise that would
impose more extensive background checks on gun purchasers,
saying it would infringe on constitutional rights. He called for
more effective enforcement of existing laws.  To contact the reporter on this story:
