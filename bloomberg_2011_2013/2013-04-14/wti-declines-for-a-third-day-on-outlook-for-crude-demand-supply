Brent crude  fell to its lowest
level in nine months and West Texas Intermediate dropped below
$90 a barrel, as economic growth eased unexpectedly in  China ,
the world’s second-largest crude consumer.  Brent declined as much as 2.5 percent to its weakest since
July 13. China’s gross domestic product in the first quarter
rose 7.7 percent from a year earlier, according to the National
Bureau of Statistics. That compares with the 8 percent median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey and 7.9 percent in the prior
quarter. Nicolas Maduro was elected president of  Venezuela ,
OPEC’s third-biggest oil producer.  “This simply confirms the picture of a slowing economy”
in China, said Guy Wolf,  Global Head  of Market Analytics at
Marex Spectron Group in  London , who predicts Brent may fall as
low as $85 this quarter. “Globally, the picture is not
healthy.”  Brent for May settlement, which expires today, fell as much
as $2.56, or 2.5 percent, to $100.55 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange, and traded at $101.32 at
12:57 p.m. local time. The more-active June future dropped $1.48
to $101.56 a barrel. The front-month European benchmark grade
was at a premium of $11.76 to WTI futures.  WTI for May delivery decreased as much as $3.24, or 3.6
percent, to $88.05 in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the lowest since Dec. 21. It was at $89.56
a barrel at 12:57 p.m. London time. The volume of all futures
traded was 233 percent above the 100-day average.  Iran Outlook  “Given the supply situation and the growth in supplies,
the market really needed either increased political risk or a
better-than-expected demand outlook to hold those prices up,”
said Ric Spooner, a chief market analyst at CMC Markets in
Sydney.  Iran  may call for an emergency meeting of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries if  oil prices  keep falling
below $100 a barrel, state-run Mehr news agency reported, citing
an unidentified official in the country’s Oil Ministry.  Brent crude may trade from $110 to $115 in the second half
of this year because excess supply will diminish, Morgan Stanley
said in a report published today.  “We would be buyers as Brent approached $100 a barrel,”
Adam Longson, an analyst at the bank in  New York , said in the
report.  Money Managers  Net-long positions in WTI held by money managers dropped
for the first time in four weeks, according to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission’s April 12 Commitments of Traders
report. They dropped by 9,080 futures and options combined, or
4.4 percent, to 196,330 in the week ended April 9, the CFTC
report showed.  Hedge funds , commodity pools and commodity-trading advisers
also slashed bullish bets on gasoline by the most in four
months. Money managers reduced net-long positions by 17 percent
to 63,856 futures and options combined, the largest drop since
Dec. 11. Gasoline futures for May delivery slid as much as 5.62
cents, or 2 percent, to $2.7456 a gallon on Nymex today.  Maduro Elected  Venezuela’s Maduro, a 50-year-old former bus driver,
received 50.7 percent of the votes in the nation’s presidential
election, the electoral council said after more than 99 percent
of ballots were counted. Maduro campaigned on a pledge to deepen
14 years of the late Hugo Chavez’s socialist revolution.  Venezuela’s investment in oil exploration and production
may extend a long-term decline on Maduro’s election if he
decides to continue the policy of using profits from state-owned
oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA to fund social welfare
projects, the  International Energy Agency  said in its monthly
oil market report March 13.  South Sudan  has started pumping crude through  Sudan ,
Skynews Arabia reported yesterday, without providing details.
South Sudan halted production in January 2012 after accusing the
Sudanese government of stealing $815 million of its oil, which
Sudan said it took to recover unpaid fees. The nations agreed
last month to resume southern shipments through a Red Sea export
terminal within two weeks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
