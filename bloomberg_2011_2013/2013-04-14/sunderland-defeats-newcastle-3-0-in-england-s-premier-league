Manchester United won 2-0 at  Stoke
City  as it nears a record-extending 20th English league title.
Sunderland defeated Newcastle 3-0 in today’s northeast derby.  Michael Carrick  opened the scoring in the fourth minute,
and  Robin van Persie  converted a penalty kick in the 66th as
United restored a 15-point lead in the standings.   United leads the Premier League with 80 points from 32
games, followed by defending champion Manchester City, with 65
from 31 matches. Then come Arsenal (59), Chelsea and Tottenham
(both 58) and Everton (55). Teams play 38 games in all.  The result deepens Stoke’s relegation concerns. It’s
slipped to 16th place, only three points above the three-team
drop zone, and was today overtaken by Sunderland on goal
difference.  Sunderland’s win over Newcastle eased its own relegation
risks and clinched a first victory for new manager Paolo Di Canio.  Stephane Sessegnon gave the visitors the lead in the 27th
minute at St. James’ Park.  Adam Johnson  made it 2-0 in the 74th
minute with a left-foot curling shot from outside the penalty
area.  David Vaughan slammed in a shot from the left of the area
for the third goal, in the 82nd minute. It was Di Canio’s
second game in charge.  At the bottom of the standings, Reading and Queens Park
Rangers have 24 points, with Wigan on 31, and  Aston Villa , Stoke
and Sunderland all on 34. Norwich has 35 and Newcastle 36.  Yesterday, Arsenal beat Norwich 3-1, Aston Villa drew 1-1
with Fulham, and West Ham tied 1-1 at Southampton. Reading drew
0-0 with Liverpool and Everton defeated Queens Park Rangers 2-0.  Also today,  Manchester City  plays Chelsea in an F.A. Cup
semifinal. The winner will play Wigan, which beat Millwall 2-0
yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
