Police arrested 27 soccer fans
after violence broke out following the derby match between
northeast England teams Newcastle and Sunderland,  Sky Sports 
reported.  Missiles were thrown at police as rival supporters were
involved in angry scenes at Central Station in Newcastle upon
Tyne. Three police officers were hurt and one was taken to the
hospital. Sunderland had won the game 3-0.  Yesterday there was violence at a game in  London , when
Millwall fans fought among themselves at an F.A. Cup semifinal.  Television images showed police breaking up the trouble,
which left some supporters bloodied and younger ones crying.
Police said 14 men were arrested at the game, 12 of them
Millwall fans. The two Wigan supporters arrested were not
involved in disorder with Millwall followers, police said. Wigan
won the game 2-0 and will play  Manchester City  in the final.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
