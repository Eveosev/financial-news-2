Dan Girardi fired a 20-foot wrist
shot in overtime to give the  New York Rangers  a 1-0 victory over
the  New York Islanders  in a National Hockey League contest.  The Islanders (21-16-5) with 47 points hold the seventh
playoff berth in the Eastern Conference, one point ahead of the
Rangers (21-16-4). The Winnipeg Jets (21-19-2) are in ninth
place with 44 points.  The Islanders have one home game before they end the season
with five games on the road. The Rangers have seven games left,
three on home ice at Madison Square Garden.  Girardiâ€™s goal last night at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale,
New York, was his second of the season; the first came against
the Islanders on Feb. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
