Capitulating bears and overseas
buyers are drowning out every other concern for American stocks,
pushing the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  to successive records
even after the biggest drop in Treasury yields since June.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index closed at all-time highs
twice last week and hasn’t traded more than 1.8 percent away
from its record in the 23 days since March 11, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The 2.1 percent  advance  over that period
came as  rates  on 10-year  government bonds  tumbled 0.36
percentage point to as low as 1.7 percent. Plunges of that size
coincided with losses of 4.6 percent for equities since 2010.  Bulls say U.S. shares are becoming less vulnerable to
global shocks and will keep rallying as skepticism eases among
professional investors. Gains such as the 1.2 percent advance on
April 10 have been accompanied by even bigger jumps in companies
with the most short interest. Bears say indiscriminate buying
shows the rally is in its last stages and stocks will fall as
earnings drop and Federal Reserve stimulus ends.  “New highs are bringing in buyers, people who have been on
the sidelines,” Paul Zemsky, the New York-based head of  asset
allocation  for ING Investment Management which oversees $180
billion, said by phone April 11. “People have been afraid of
the stock market, they still remember 2008. But as time goes on
and as equity prices go up they’ll continue get more comfortable
and we’ll continue to see flows into equities.”  Successive Records  The S&P 500 advanced 2.3 percent  last week , the biggest
gain since January, and closed at successive records of 1,587.73
and 1,593.37 on April 10 and April 11. The benchmark index
dropped 2.3 percent to 1,552.36 today.  The gauge has climbed 11 percent this year as U.S. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  pledged to hold  interest rates  near
zero percent and maintain the program of bond purchases known as
quantitative easing, or QE.  Gains were led by stocks that had fallen in 2013.  First
Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the Tempe, Arizona-based power technology developer,
has jumped 38 percent since sliding 13 percent in the first
quarter.  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF) , the Cleveland-based
iron-ore mining company, rallied 8.8 percent on April 9, its
biggest increase since September. The shares were down 52
percent for 2013 before last week.  Lockstep Moves  The stock-market rally last week was a departure from
increasingly  lockstep moves  among equity prices and bond yields,
where correlations in 2013 have reached record highs. U.S.
equities and bond rates have moved in the same direction 80
percent of the time this quarter as investors sold fixed-income
securities amid signs of an improving economy, compared with an
average of 63 percent of the time since the  S&P 500  began
tumbling from the October 2007 record, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  While close moves between yields and stocks increased,
bonds have risen with equities since 2009 as the Fed spent more
than $2 trillion buying securities. U.S. Treasuries have gained
18 percent, according to Bank of America Corp. indexes, since
the S&P 500 kicked off a 135 percent rally in March 2009.  Treasury yield declines in the past month came as Cyprus
imposed losses on uninsured depositors and  Bank of Japan 
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he will double monthly bond buying
to 7.5 trillion yen ($80 billion), pushing the Asian nation’s
investors to shun their government’s bonds in favor of U.S.
Treasuries. The Fed is buying $85 billion a month in bonds.  Weakening Yen  “The policy goal of weakening the yen has driven investors
into other currencies where higher yields are available,
including the dollar and euro bond markets,” said Howard Ward,
chief investment officer at Rye, New York-based Gamco Investors
Inc., which oversees $36.7 billion. “Some of this capital
flight out of the yen also finds its way into equity markets.”  Japanese investors  bought  a net 645 billion yen of foreign
equity securities in the week ended March 23, according to
Japan’s Ministry of Finance. That’s the highest level since the
data began in 2005. Purchases reached 1.61 trillion in March,
also a record, the data show.  Stocks have climbed as pessimism among the biggest
speculators diminished. A gauge of hedge-fund bullishness
measuring the proportion of their holdings that represent wagers
on rising stocks climbed to 51.6 percent last week, up from 47.3
at the end of 2012, according to data compiled by International
Strategy & Investment Group in Washington.  Short covering helped drive gains last week. An index of
S&P 500 companies with the most bearish bets increased 5.1
percent during the first four days of last week, increasing more
than the equity gauge each day. The  basket  compiled by  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  has rallied 16 percent in 2013, about four
percentage points more than the S&P 500.  Overweight Equities  A net 57 percent of global money managers, who together
oversee about $578 billion, said they were overweight on
equities last month, the highest reading since early 2011,
according to a Bank of America Corp. survey released March 19.
That’s up from 51 percent in February. Holdings in U.S. stocks
were at their highest level in eight months, it showed.  Stocks climbing as yields declining “is not
inconsistent,” Johanna Kyrklund, who helps oversee $345 billion
at Schroder Investment Management in  London , said in an
interview on April 11. “The bond yield fell because we had a
slight weakening in the data, and people are buying equities
because they are looking for return,” she said. “You don’t
need a global recovery for that rally to continue.”  Plunges in Treasury yields matching the decline since mid-
March have accompanied weakening equity prices 12 out of 14
times since 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Government Bonds  Government bond rates slid 37 basis points between May 9
and June 3 as the U.S. added fewer jobs than forecast, the
economy grew slower than previously estimated and rising
unemployment in Spain sparked concern Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis would spread. The  stock index  decreased 5.7 percent
during the period.  Rising borrowing costs in Spanish and French bond sales in
November 2011 pushed U.S. rates down 43 basis points, as
investors speculated European woes would lead to a global
slowdown. At the same time, the S&P 500 lost 9.6 percent. Stocks
declined 14 percent as bond yields lost more than a percentage
point from July to September 2011 as lawmakers were failing to
reach an agreement on raising the U.S. debt limit.  April has marked the beginning of the biggest stock market
retreats since 2009. The S&P 500  fell  9.9 percent from April 2
through June 1 last year, before surging to a record last month.
In 2011, the index slumped 19.4 percent, its biggest decline of
the  bull market , then recovered to end the year within a point
of where it started. The 2010 drop started April 23, with the
index declining 16 percent through July.  ‘Pain Trade’  “Listening to what investors are telling us, they are
waiting for a correction,” Alan Mudie, who helps oversee $87
billion as chief investment officer at Union Bancaire Privee in
Geneva, said April 11. “That often acts as something of a
contrarian phenomenon. When investors in the sidelines are
waiting to get in, the pain trade is for the market to grind
higher.”  Job creation  sputtered in March as employers hired fewer
people than forecast, Labor Department data showed April 5. A
report from the  Institute for Supply Management  showed that
 service industries  expanded in March at the slowest pace in
seven months, signaling the economy may find it hard to
accelerate.  Falling Earnings  U.S. companies will post their first profit contraction
since 2009 this quarter, according to the average of more than
11,000 analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. The projected
1.4 percent drop comes after growth slowed last year to a
quarterly average of 4.7 percent, compared to 28  percent  in 2010
and 2011. Of 30  companies  that have reported results so far, 21
have exceeded analyst estimates.  “We are a bit more surprised by the resilience of equities
than by the strong performance in bonds,” Joost van Leenders,
who helps oversee $657 billion as a strategist at BNP Paribas
Investment Partners in Amsterdam, said in an April 9 phone
interview. “We think some of the fundamentals in the economy
are changing, and that will have an impact on earnings.”  Rebounds in stocks after crises from surging debt in Greece
to S&P’s decision to strip the U.S. of its AAA credit rating in
August 2011 make future threats less daunting, said  James Paulsen , the Minneapolis-based chief investment strategist at
Wells Capital Management, which oversees about $325 billion of
assets.  Jobless Claims  The S&P 500 rallied 0.4 percent on April 4 even as jobless
claims unexpectedly increased, while bond yields fell to 1.76
percent. On Jan. 18, stocks rose to a five-year high on better-
than-estimated earnings from  General Electric Co. (GE)  and Goldman
Sachs, as rates dropped to 1.84 percent after policy makers
failed to resolve debt-limit increases.  Equities rallied 10 percent in the first  quarter , pushing
the S&P 500 to a new record, buoyed by an influx of money to
equity mutual funds. Retail investors have added about $19.5
billion to mutual funds that invest in U.S. equities in 2013,
according to Washington-based  Investment Company Institute .
While that’s the best start to a year since 2006, deposits
follow almost $400 billion taken out the last four years.  “People have been burned enough,” Paulsen said in an
April 9 phone interview. “They sold out just to watch stocks
rally to new highs in 2012 and 2011 on stories of the end of the
world that never came to pass. Stock investors are starting to
say, ‘I don’t know if I still buy that view.’”  To contact the reporters on this story:
