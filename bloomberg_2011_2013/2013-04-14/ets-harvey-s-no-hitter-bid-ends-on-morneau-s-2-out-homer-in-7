New York  Mets pitcher Matt Harvey’s
bid for the first no-hitter of the 2013 Major League Baseball
season ended with two outs in the seventh inning as  Minnesota 
Twins Justin Morneau hit a home run.  Harvey (3-0) did get the win, allowing one run on two hits
and striking out six in eight innings last night at Target Field
in  Minneapolis  as the Mets (7-4) defeated the Twins 4-2. Bobby Parnell tallied his first save, giving up one run on two hits
and striking out two in the ninth inning.  “I was blowing it foul, but I knew he hit it pretty
well,” Harvey said about Morneau’s drive as it approached the
right-field foul pole. “If it was going anywhere, it was going
out.”  Marlon Byrd started the Met’s four-run fifth inning with a
home run. Collin Cowgill, Daniel Murphy and  David Wright  added
run-scoring singles.  Twins starter Scott Diamond (0-1) allowed four runs and
eight hits in 4 1/3 innings as Minnesota fell to 4-7.  “The way the first four innings went, getting out of the
third inning I was pretty pumped by that and thought it was a
big step,” Diamond said. “Just the way the fifth kind of sped
up on me, they put a lot of hits together in that inning. You
know, a little frustrating.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
