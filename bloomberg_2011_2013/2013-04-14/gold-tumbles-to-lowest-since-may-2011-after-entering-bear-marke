Gold slumped to the lowest price in
almost two years, extending a decline after entering into a  bear
market , as investors reduced asset holdings. Silver dropped to
the lowest since November 2010.  Gold for immediate delivery declined as much as 0.3 percent
to $1,478.20 an ounce, the cheapest since May 2011, and was at
$1,487.05 by 7:31 a.m. in  Singapore . Prices fell to $1,483 on
April 12, down 22 percent from a record close of $1,900.23 in
September 2011, meeting the common definition of a bear market.  Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by bullion
declined to 2,406.16 metric tons on April 12, the lowest since
August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bullion has
plunged 11 percent in 2013, after 12 straight annual gains, as
the global economy improved. Gold for June delivery dropped as
