Manchester City beat trophy-holder
Chelsea 2-1 to reach the final of English soccer’s F.A. Cup
against Wigan on May 11.  Samir Nasri and  Sergio Aguero  got the goals for City, a
five-time F.A. Cup winner that most recently won the competition
in 2011. Demba Ba scored for Chelsea at London’s Wembley
Stadium. Chelsea was seeking its fifth Cup title in seven
seasons and an eighth in total.  City took the lead in the 35th minute. Yaya Toure surged
forward and his pass was played by Aguero into the path of
Nasri, who got a lucky ricochet before slotting the ball into
the net.  Aguero made it 2-0 in the 47th minute with a looping header
over goalkeeper  Petr Cech  and into the net off a post.  Ba got the Blues back into the game, seizing on to a long
through-ball and swivelling to strike a volley past City
goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon, standing in for  Joe Hart . Soon
after, Pantilimon saved at the feet of  Juan Mata  as Chelsea
turned up the pressure.  Wigan beat second-tier Millwall 2-0 in the other Wembley
semifinal yesterday to reach the F.A. Cup final for the first
time. The match was overshadowed by violence as some Millwall
fans fought each other. Police said  a total of 14 men were
arrested.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
