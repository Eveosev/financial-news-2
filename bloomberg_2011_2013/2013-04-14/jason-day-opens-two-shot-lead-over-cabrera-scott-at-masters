Jason Day birdied the par-15 15th
hole to open a two-shot lead over  Adam Scott  and  Angel Cabrera 
during the final round at golf’s Masters Tournament.  Day, seeking to become the first Australian winner at
Augusta National Golf Club, is 9-under with three holes to play.  The Masters is the only one of the four major tournaments
that’s never been won by an Australian golfer. While Day and
Scott tied for second in 2011, Greg Norman was a runner-up three
times in Augusta, most famously in 1996, when he blew a six-shot
lead in the final round and was beaten by Nick Faldo.  Marc Leishman, another Australian, is 6-under, one ahead of
Tiger Woods.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
