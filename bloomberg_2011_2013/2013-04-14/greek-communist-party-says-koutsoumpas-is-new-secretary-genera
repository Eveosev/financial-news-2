Dimitris Koutsoumpas was elected to
the post of secretary general of the Communist Party of  Greece ,
the Athens-based party, known as  KKE , said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Koutsoumpas replaces Aleka Papariga, previously Greeceâ€™s
only female leader of a political party with lawmakers, who had
led the party since 1991.  KKE has the smallest number of lawmakers of the seven
parties in the Greek parliament with 12 deputies in the 300-seat
legislature.  To contact the reporter on this story:
