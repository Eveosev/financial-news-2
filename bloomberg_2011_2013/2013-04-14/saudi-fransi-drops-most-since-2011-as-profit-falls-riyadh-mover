Banque Saudi Fransi (BSFR)  tumbled the
most since March 2011 after the lender partly owned by  Credit
Agricole SA (ACA)  reported a 13 percent decline in first-quarter
profit, missing analysts’ estimates.  The shares declined 7.2 percent to 29.60 riyals at 12:05
a.m. in Riyadh, valuing the lender at 26.8 billion riyals ($7.1
billion). The benchmark  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  retreated 0.7
percent.  Net income declined to 684 million riyals, the bank said in
a statement today. Net special commission income fell to 799
million riyals from 802 million riyals. The mean estimate of
eight analysts was for a profit of 772.5 million riyals, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Banque Saudi Fransi “reported a set of weak results” due
to an increase in provisions, NCB Capital’s analyst Mahmood Akbar wrote in an e-mailed report. “We believe the weak result
should affect the short-term sentiment.”  Provision charges increased 2.5 times year-on-year in the
first quarter and doubled on a quarterly basis to 155 million
Riyals, NCB Capital wrote in the report. Eight analysts have a
buy rating on the stock, six say hold and none recommends
selling,  according to data compiled by Bloomberg .  To contact the reporter on this story:
