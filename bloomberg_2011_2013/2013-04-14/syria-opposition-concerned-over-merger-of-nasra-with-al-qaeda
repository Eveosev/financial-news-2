(Corrects spelling of Nusra in headline in story
originally published April 14.)  The Syrian National Coalition, an
opposition group recognized by the Arab League as representative
of the Syrian people, urged the Islamist militia Jabhat al-Nusra
to “stay within” ranks after the group merged with al-Qaeda.  “The Syrian Coalition is deeply concerned about recent
statements regarding the affiliations and ideologies of
particular factions of the rebel forces,”  the coalition  said in
an e-mailed statement today. “The Syrian Coalition urges Jabhat
al-Nusra to stay within the ranks of nationalistic Syrians, to
continue its efforts in fighting the Assad regime, and in
supporting and protecting the freedom of all Syrian sects.”  Al-Nusra, which along with other rebel factions is seeking
to topple President Bashar al-Assad’s government, was designated
by the U.S. State Department as a terrorist group in December
because of ties to al-Qaeda.  The SNC was given  Syria ’s seat in the Arab League last
month after it elected Ghassan Hitto as interim prime minister.  The conflict in Syria, which began in 2011 with peaceful
protests, has escalated into a civil war that has taken at least
70,000 lives and forced hundreds of thousands of refugees to
flee to neighboring Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
