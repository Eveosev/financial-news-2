Japan’s aviation bureau mistakenly
reported a North Korean missile launch as it sought damage
reports from airports after the biggest earthquake in the
western part of the country since 1995.  The bureau sent the pre-written e-mail alert to 87 airport
offices after the temblor hit at 5:33 a.m. yesterday, the
Transportation Ministry said in a  statement . The message was
retracted at 5:39 a.m., and it may have caused a delay as long
as four minutes to one flight, according to the statement.  The ministry will require that two officials check all
weekend mobile-phone alerts prior to distribution to prevent any
similar mistake, it said in an e-mailed release last night.  The 5.8-magnitude quake was the biggest in the region since
the 7.2-magnitude Great Hanshin Earthquake in January 1995,
Japan’s Meteorological Agency said. There were 23 people injured
due to the tremor, the Fire and Disaster management Agency said
in a statement yesterday. No damage to nuclear plants was
reported, it said.  A magnitude-9 quake and subsequent tsunami off  Japan ’s
northeast coast on March 11, 2011, crippled Tokyo Electric Power
Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi atomic station, causing meltdowns and
radiation leaks that will leave areas around the plant
uninhabitable for decades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
