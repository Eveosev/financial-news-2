 The creation of an Israeli
sovereign wealth fund for revenue from natural-gas discoveries
will help the government manage currency-market expectations, a
top adviser to the prime minister said.  A draft law creating the fund was approved in principle
today by the Cabinet, said Eugene Kandel, head of the National
Economic Council. While the fund will probably enjoy income only
in 2016 or 2017, the government is rushing to prepare the
framework for its operation now, he said.  Prospects for a natural-gas boom from fields discovered off
Israel’s Mediterranean coast have helped strengthen the shekel
by 3 percent this year, making it the fourth-best performer
after the  Mexican peso , the Brazilian real and the  New Zealand
dollar  among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Bank of
Israel Governor Stanley Fischer bought foreign currency to
weaken the shekel last week, acting for the first time since
July 2011.  “The reason we are doing it now is because we want to
manage the expectations of various  currency markets , to show
that we understand what ‘ Dutch Disease ’ is and we are going to
take care of its consequences,” Kandel said on a conference
call with reporters today.  The term “Dutch disease” was coined by the Economist
magazine to describe a surge in income from new natural-gas
fields in the Netherlands during the 1960s that triggered a
currency gain and eroded earnings for the country’s other
exporters. The term has since been applied to similar situations
from  Venezuela  to Russia to describe how natural-resource
discoveries can hurt industry.  To contact the reporters on this story:
