Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. is in exclusive talks to buy  Life Technologies Corp. (LIFE)  for more than $70 a share, according to people familiar with the discussions.  The deal is still not final and may fall through, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. The two sides are trying to complete the deal this weekend, they said.
