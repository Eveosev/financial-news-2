The al-Nusra Front in  Syria  pledged
formal allegiance to al-Qaeda last week. Together with the
alarming escalation in refugees fleeing the country, this pact
demands a forceful change in the diffident strategies of the
U.S. and  Europe  toward the conflict.  The U.S. has good reasons for not wanting to own another
war in the Middle East, and we support them. But does anyone
believe the U.S. could stand aside if al-Qaeda were to gain
control of all or part of a state that has chemical weapons and
Scud missiles and shares borders with Iraq, Israel,  Jordan ,
Lebanon and  Turkey ?  Al-Nusra’s pledge to al-Qaeda offers an opportunity,
however. The group’s terrorist bombing tactics and imposition of
radical Islamist rules have begun to erode its popular support
and ties to other fighters. Last month al-Nusra began to fight
with another less radical  rebel group  in northern Syria. The
more al-Qaeda and non-al-Qaeda rebels define themselves against
each other, the less difficult it will be for the U.S. and its
allies to identify fighters they can arm and work with.  Other pieces now falling into place may ease the path to
action. The Syrian opposition is forming a government, which may
help with legal hurdles to greater intervention. The European
Union’s arms embargo will expire at the end of May and, thanks
to opposition by  France  and the U.K., is unlikely to be renewed.
Opposition groups not linked to al-Qaeda are gaining control
over a patch of southern Syria that borders Israel and Jordan.  The U.S. is shifting its position, but late and slowly. It
is an open secret that U.S.  personnel  are training rebels in
Jordan, and Secretary of State  John Kerry  has said the U.S. will
start sending nonlethal aid directly to the Free Syrian Army,
though exactly what the U.S. will provide remains unclear.  The U.S. and its allies should make their April 20 meeting
in Istanbul a watershed. First, they must close the shameful,
and increasingly dangerous, shortfall in funding for the
humanitarian aid operation. The  United Nations  has  registered 
more than 1 million Syrian refugees and estimates that 3.6
million people have been displaced within the country -- and yet
it has received less than a third of the $1 billion it was
promised. The crisis threatens to destabilize Jordan and
Lebanon.  Second, they should use the meeting to consolidate control
over the disparate sources of arms and training for the Free
Syrian Army. President  Barack Obama ’s meetings with leaders from
Qatar, Turkey and the  United Arab Emirates  over the next month
could provide a useful opportunity to advance this approach.  Third, they should seize on the common threat posed by al-
Nusra to persuade  Russia  to stop arming and funding Assad and
his regime. Russia has two primary concerns -- that Syria
shouldn’t become another scene of unilateral U.S. intervention
in the Middle East, and that the country shouldn’t fall to chaos
or Islamists radicals. By now it is clear the U.S. has no desire
to repeat a Libya-style intervention in Syria, and that it
shares Russia’s goals.  A cease-fire deal and heavily armed peacekeeping force
approved by the UN remains the most desirable next step for
Syria. That’s difficult, given the uncompromising stances of
both Assad and the rebel fighters. But Assad and Russia should
know that the next step, absent a Security Council agreement,
will be to increase arms supplies to the opposition, including
anti-aircraft weapons, and to create buffer zones to shelter
fleeing civilians, beginning in the South along the Jordanian
border.  All actions involve risks. In this case, so does the status
quo. When a quarter of a nation at the heart of the  Middle East 
has been displaced, and al-Qaeda is close to acquiring weapons
of mass destruction, equivocation is no longer safe or
acceptable.  To contact the Bloomberg View editorial board:
