Toronto Blue Jays shortstop  Jose Reyes  will probably not return for three months after spraining
his ankle sliding into second base against the Kansas City
Royals two days ago, the team said.  Reyes was placed on the 15-day disabled list after being
carted off the field in the sixth inning of the Blue Jays’ 8-4
victory over the Royals.  “I heard something pop in my ankle,” Reyes told reporters
yesterday before the Blue Jays game. “I knew from the beginning
that something was not right. I was in pain right away.”  Reyes, who sustained a similar ankle injury in 2003 when he
was with the  New York  Mets as he tried to break up a double play,
said he attempted to steal second feet first because he thought
he was too close to the base to go head first.  “I never go feet first,” Reyes said. “Things happen so
quickly in a baseball game, you don’t think about it, you just
do it.”  Reyes was hitting .395 in 38 at-bats for the Blue Jays this
season.  Reyes was part of a 12-player trade with the  Miami Marlins 
on Nov. 19 that also brought All-Stars  Mark Buehrle , Josh Johnson and John Buck to Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
