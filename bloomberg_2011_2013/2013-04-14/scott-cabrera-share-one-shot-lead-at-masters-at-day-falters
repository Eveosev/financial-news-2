Adam Scott  and Angel Cabrera share
a one-shot lead at the Masters Tournament after Jason Day had a
bogey at the 17th hole.  Cabrera sank a birdie putt at No. 16 to move alongside
Scott at 8-under par. Moments later, Day missed his putt for par
at the next-to-last hole to fall back to 7-under.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
