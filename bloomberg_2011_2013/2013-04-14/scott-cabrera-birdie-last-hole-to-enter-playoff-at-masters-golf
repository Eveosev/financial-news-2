Adam Scott  and  Angel Cabrera  both
birdied the final hole to set up a sudden-death playoff at
golf’s Masters Tournament.  Scott and Cabrera tied at 9-under par after four rounds.
Scott sank his long birdie putt at No. 18 before Cabrera, in the
final group, matched him from close range as rain fell at
Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia.  The players will start the playoff at the 18th hole and go
on to No. 10, if needed. Those holes will then be played
alternately, if necessary, until a champion is determined.  It’s the 17th playoff in Masters history. Bubba Watson beat
Louis Oosthuizen on the second playoff hole last year, while
Cabrera won a three-way shootout against  Kenny Perry  and Chad
Campbell in 2009.  Cabrera is seeking to become the 17th multiple winner of
the Masters, while Scott is trying to become the first player
from Australia to claim the title.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
