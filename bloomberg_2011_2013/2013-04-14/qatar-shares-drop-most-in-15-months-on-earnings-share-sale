Qatar’s benchmark stock index fell
the most in more than a year after Qatar Gas Transport Co.’s
earnings missed estimates and as investors freed up funds for
the share sale of Doha Global Investment. Egypt’s EGX 30 rose.  Qatar’s QE Index retreated 1.2 percent, the most since
January 2012, to 8,381.03 at the close in Doha. Qatar Gas, known
as Nakilat, slid 2.1 percent, while  National Leasing (NLCS)  dropped to
the lowest level since August 2011 after reporting an 11 percent
decline in first-quarter profit. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200) ,
which tracks companies in the Gulf Cooperation Council,
decreased 0.8 percent, the most since Nov. 25, at the close in
 Riyadh , led by  Banque Saudi Fransi. (BSFR)   Doha Global Investment will seek to raise $3 billion in an
initial public offering to Qatari nationals next month,
according to the Qatar Exchange. About 5.8 million shares were
traded today in Doha, compared with a 12-month daily average of
about 6 million shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The drop is “a combination of investors selling to prepare
for the IPO and disappointment of corporate earnings so far,”
said Tariq Qaqish, deputy head of asset management at Dubai-
based Al Mal Capital PSC. “Investors are worried that the IPO
will dry the liquidity.”  Nakilat retreated to 15.63 riyals. First-quarter profit
rose less than 1 percent to 177.2 million riyals, that missed
estimates of 210 million riyals by Qatar National Bank Financial
Services and 207 million riyals by EFG-Hermes Holding SAE,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. National Leasing shares
declined 2.5 percent to 32.95 riyals.  Profit Drops  Saudi Arabia ’s benchmark Tadawul All Share Index declined

13 percent.  Elsewhere in the  Persian Gulf ,  Abu Dhabi ’s index rose 0.2
percent, while Dubai’s DFM General Index was little changed.

0.1 percent and Kuwait’s measure declined 0.2 percent.  Egypt’s benchmark EGX 30 Index climbed 1.3 percent. EFG-
Hermes, the country’s biggest investment bank, increased 2.7
percent to 10.66 pounds, the highest level since March 19.

publicly traded lender, gained 3.2 percent.  Israel’s TA-25 Index lost less than 0.1 percent. The yield
on the government’s 4.25 percent bonds due in 2023 declined two
basis points, or 0.02 of a percentage point, to a record 3.76
