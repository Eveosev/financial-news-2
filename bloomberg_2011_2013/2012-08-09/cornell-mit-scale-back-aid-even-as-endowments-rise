Cornell University  and  Massachusetts
Institute of Technology  are scaling back financial assistance to
students, adding to the burden of families already coping with
climbing college costs.  Cornell, the Ivy League school based in Ithaca,  New York ,
will force students whose families make more than $60,000 a year
to seek other financing to pay for part of their studies
starting in 2013. This fall, MIT is raising the amount low-
income students contribute by 36 percent to $6,000 a year.  Students are being asked to pay more even as college
endowments show double-digit growth as they recover from the
2008 financial crisis. With more students qualifying for aid,
 Cornell  said its spending on financial support has jumped almost
20 percent a year on average since 2008, a pace it won’t sustain
by drawing directly from the endowment. Cornell, which costs
 $60,000 a year , is good value for students’ money, even with the
changes to financial-aid, said  Barbara Knuth , vice provost and
dean of the graduate school.  “I don’t see that as problematic in the context of
providing access to an  Ivy League  education,” Knuth said.  More than 80 percent of need-based financial aid awarded to
Cornell undergraduates is provided through university funds,
according to the school. The cost to attend has climbed 4.6
percent a year on average since 2008.  Cornell’s endowment grew 20 percent to $5.35 billion in the
year ended June 30, 2011, according to the school. Still, it’s
down from a $6.1 billion peak in 2008.  Unsustainable Practice  In  January 2008 , Cornell said it would offer more financial
support to meet “the needs of our diverse student body,” by
dropping the requirement that students take out loans if their
families earn less than $75,000 a year. The decision would let
low-income students graduate debt free, the school said.  Under the plan that begins in 2013, students with family
incomes between $60,000 and $75,000 will get financial aid
packages with loans capped at $2,500 annually. The cap is $5,000
a year for those with incomes between $75,000 to $120,000.  Cornell, one of eight schools in the Northeast U.S. that
make up the Ivy League, drew  $35 million  from its endowment in
the 2009-2010 year to augment undergraduate financial aid. The
agreement will end after the 2013-2014 year, Knuth said.  “It would not be a sustainable practice to draw directly
from the endowment,” Knuth said. “That’s part of what informed
our decision to think about modifications to the financial-aid
programs to slow the rate of increase.”  Cornell has three undergraduate  land-grant colleges , which
are lower priced for New York State residents.  Families ‘Squeezed’  In 2007 and early 2008, more than 30 top private colleges
adopted no-loan policies, partly to stay competitive. They
replaced loans with grants that students didn’t have to repay,
with variations on eligibility. Most of the schools still have
those policies in place, including  Harvard University  and Yale
University.  Well-funded schools should tap endowments more to make
college more affordable and to focus resources on direct student
benefits, including aid, according to U.S. Senator  Charles Grassley , who has criticized the soaring cost of higher
education.  “Students and families are continually squeezed, no matter
how much endowments have grown, and no matter how generous the
tax breaks colleges receive,” Grassley, an Iowa Republican,
said in an e-mail.  MIT also cited its financial-aid program’s sustainability
for the changes, according to Elizabeth Hicks, executive
director of student financial services. The school’s endowment
totaled  $9.9 billion  as of June 2011, an 18 percent increase
from a year earlier, though down from $10.1 billion in 2008,
according to the school.  ‘Smoother Curve’  While MIT doesn’t have a budget shortfall to address, it
didn’t want to penalize families who made just above the income
cutoff. The new system offers a “smoother curve,” admissions
dean  Stuart Schmill  said. Like at Cornell, financial-aid
expenditures have been rising at MIT at a faster rate than
tuition increases, he said.  Back in 2008-2009, students whose families earned less than
$75,000 were expected to come up with $2,850 for the academic
year, with some covering the cost through work-study programs,
Hicks said. In  March 2008 , MIT said those students would no
longer be expected to take out loans.  Now, with the student contribution rising to $6,000 for
those receiving aid, many “will find it necessary to borrow to
meet that amount,” Hicks said.  Federal  Pell grants , which are given to low-income students
and amounted to as much as $5,500 in the 2011-2012, can be used
toward the student contribution. About 20 percent of MIT
undergraduates qualify for the grants, Schmill said.  ‘It’s Reasonable’  The average debt of MIT undergraduates in the class of 2012
was $20,794 and 41 percent of students borrowed, Hicks said.  “Relative to their potential earnings, we think it’s
reasonable,” Hicks said. The price tag for the coming year at
MIT, based in Cambridge,  Massachusetts ,  is $57,010.   Williams College  and  Dartmouth College , both facing
endowment losses and budget pressures, said in 2010 they would
scale back their so-called no-loan programs, making them
available only to families with incomes of $75,000 or less.  In March of this year, Dartmouth said it would increase the
 income cap  to $100,000.  Hanover, New Hampshire-based Dartmouth’s endowment was
valued at $3.4 billion as of June 2011, down from a high of $3.7
billion three years earlier, according to the Ivy League school.  Williams, in Williamstown, Massachusetts, is the wealthiest
liberal arts college with an endowment of $1.78 billion,
according to  data  from the National Association of College and
University Business Officers and Commonfund Institute. Its peak
value was $1.9 billion in June 2007, according to the school.  Richest Schools  While Harvard and Yale, the world’s richest schools,
respectively, and  Stanford University , ranked fifth based on the
NACUBO data, haven’t changed their no-loan programs, they have
asked the wealthiest families that qualify for aid to pay more.
The aid has been shifted to poorer families, the schools said.  Harvard’s endowment was valued at $31.7 billion as of June
2011. Yale’s was $19.4 billion, and Stanford’s fund was $16.5
billion as of August 2011.  Carleton College, a liberal arts school in Northfield,
 Minnesota , dropped its loan-free aid program for families that
earn less than $40,000 a year.  Carleton began the program in 2008 because it wanted to woo
more top-performing applicants, said Paul Thiboutot, dean of
admissions and financial aid. In the end, the percentage of
students choosing to come to Carleton didn’t increase because of
the no-loan program, so the school scrapped it, he said.  Carleton’s endowment was $646 million as of June 30, 2012,
according to preliminary data provided by the school, down from
$678 million at its peak in December 2007.  Tuition, Debt  Average tuition and fees at U.S. private colleges have
almost doubled over the past 13 years to $28,500, even amid two
recessions, according to data compiled by the  College Board , a
nonprofit group whose members include universities. That doesn’t
include room and board, books and some other expenses.  Undergraduates from the  class of 2010  had average debt of
$25,250, according to The Institute for College Access & Success
in Oakland,  California . Outstanding student debt is about $1
trillion, exceeding what Americans owe on credit cards,
according to the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
