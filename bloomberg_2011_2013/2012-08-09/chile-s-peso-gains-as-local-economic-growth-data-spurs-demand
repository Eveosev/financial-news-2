Chile ’s peso rose for a fifth
consecutive day as better-than-forecast economic data spur
demand for the Andean nation’s currency.  The peso strengthened 0.4 percent to 474.44 per dollar at
10:46 a.m. in Santiago.  The gain is “tied to inflows by investors seeking
opportunities in local fixed income,” Sergio Tricio, head of
research at ForexChile, said in a phone interview from Santiago.  Data published in the past 11 days showed Chile’s economy
is growing faster than forecast with near record-low
unemployment, salaries rising more than twice as fast as prices
and an 8.9 percent annual increase in retail sales.  The peso is the best performing of the Latin American
currencies tracked by Bloomberg this year and has appreciated
5.7 percent this quarter even as the price of copper, which
makes up more than half of Chile’s exports, has fallen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
