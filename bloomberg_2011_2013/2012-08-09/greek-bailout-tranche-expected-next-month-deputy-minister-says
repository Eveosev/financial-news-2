Greece  will likely get the next
tranche of bailout funds from international creditors in
September, after the government presents 11.5 billion euros ($14
billion) of budget cuts, Deputy Finance Minister Christos Staikouras said.  Greece is aiming to outline the cuts by Sept. 14 as agreed
with the creditors, who will return to  Athens  to complete a
review of the economy, Staikouras said in an  interview  with ANT1
TV today.  “If the review is positive, which is what we are after, the
tranche will come right after,” Staikouras said.  The country risks running out of money without the
disbursement of 4.2 billion euros originally due in June as the
first installment of a 31 billion-euro transfer.  A team of officials from the European Union,  European
Central Bank  and  International Monetary Fund , the so-called
troika, will return to the Greek capital later this month to
assess the package of cuts for 2013 and 2014, Staikouras said.
The heads of the mission will arrive early next month to
complete work on a review of the economy before a Sept. 14
meeting of euro-area finance ministers, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
