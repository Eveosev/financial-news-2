The dollar rose against the euro and
the yen amid speculation global central banks won’t be quick to
add stimulus and as yields on U.S. Treasuries reached the
highest levels in more than a month, attracting investors.  The euro slid versus most major peers after economists in a
European Central Bank survey cut their 2013 growth forecast to
0.6 percent from 1 percent. While the ECB and the  Federal
Reserve  signaled last week there may be more steps to spur
economic growth, they refrained from taking action. The  extra
yield  for investing in U.S. two-year debt versus comparable
Japanese securities climbed, and U.S. stocks fluctuated.  “Investors went another session without finding much drive
to sustain the recent risk rally,”  Joe Manimbo , a market
analyst in  Washington  at Western Union Business Solutions, a
unit of  Western Union Co. (WU) , said in a telephone interview.
“That’s worked in favor of safer assets like the dollar.”  The euro dropped 0.5 percent to $1.2306 at 5 p.m.  New York 
time in its third daily loss. It was headed for a five-day drop
after gaining for the past two weeks. The 17-nation currency
fell 0.3 percent to 96.69 yen, after rising earlier as much as
0.3 percent. The greenback appreciated 0.2 percent to 78.57 yen.  Treasury  two-year note  yields touched 0.28 percent, the
highest since July 6. Japanese two-year government debt yielded
less than 0.1 percent for a difference of 18 basis points, or
0.18 percentage point, almost the most since July 5. U.S. 10-
year yields reached 1.73 percent, the highest since May 30.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  ended the day little
changed after falling 0.2 percent and rising 0.3 percent. It
gained for the past four days.  Deficit Narrows  Japan ’s currency erased an earlier gain versus the dollar
after data showed the U.S.  trade deficit  narrowed more than
forecast as a drop in crude  oil prices  helped cut the nation’s
import bill. The gap shrank 11 percent in June to $42.9 billion,
the smallest since December 2010, from $48 billion in May,
Commerce Department figures showed in Washington.  “The narrowing of the trade deficit and the components of
it will help add to second-quarter GDP -- more economic
growth,” Carl Forcheski, a director on the corporate currency
sales desk at Societe Generale SA in New York, said in a
telephone interview. “It helps risk sentiment a little bit,
which usually hurts the yen.”  The currency had appreciated after the  Bank of Japan (8301) 
refrained from adding stimulus at a policy meeting. The central
bank kept its asset-purchase fund at 45 trillion yen ($574
billion) and lending facility at 25 trillion yen, according to a
statement released in  Tokyo . All 22 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News predicted no change.  ‘Another Storm’  The euro declined 1.6 percent over the past month versus
nine developed-nation counterparts tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar fell 2 percent, while
the yen lost 0.9 percent.  Capital has begun flowing out of the countries sharing the
euro, signaling “another storm” may be about to break,
according to Thomas Kressin of Pacific Investment Management
Co., which manages the world’s biggest bond fund.  The euro lost 5 percent of its value since the beginning of
May, on a trade-weighted basis, and about 8 percent against the
dollar, according to Kressin, head of European foreign exchange
at Pimco in Munich. That contrasts with earlier crisis periods
when the euro held steady as capital flowed from peripheral
nations into the core, Kressin said in a posting on the
company’s website.  Bigger Contraction  The economists surveyed by the ECB forecast the region’s
economy will shrink 0.3 percent in 2012, compared with a 0.2
percent contraction predicted last quarter.  The euro may drop further, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch, citing technical analysis. A break below the
$1.2290 level clears the way for a drop to the area between
$1.2167 and $1.2134 and its 2012 low of $1.2042 in July,  MacNeil Curry , head of foreign-exchange and interest-rates technical
strategy in New York, wrote today in a client note. The euro may
drop all the way to the $1.1876 area of June 2010, he wrote.  The 17-nation currency has a long-term target of $1.10,
Nick Sargen, chief investment officer at Fort Washington
Investment Advisors Inc. in Cincinnati, said in a telephone
interview. The firm oversees $40 billion.  ‘Further Weakness’  “You have a lot of economies in the periphery that aren’t
competitive,” Sargen said on Bloomberg Television’s “Lunch
Money” in an interview with  Stephanie Ruhle . “If they weren’t
tied to the euro, they would’ve been depreciating long ago. The
long-term process of adjustment points in the direction of
eventual further weakness of the euro.”  The euro has a 40.9 percent chance of breaking up by year-
end and a 56.1 percent chance of dissolving by the end of 2013,
according to Dublin-based Intrade.com. The odds were 36.4
percent and 55.1 percent a week ago.  The Norwegian krone fell against all of its major
counterparts, weakening as much as 1 percent to 5.9375 against
the greenback in its biggest intraday drop since July 6.  The Canadian dollar reached a record high against the euro
after Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  said the strength of
the nation’s economy may require interest rates to be increased.
The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, climbed as much as 1
percent to C$1.2173 to the shared currency. It gained 0.3
percent to 99.11 cents per  U.S. dollar .  Mexican Peso  Mexico ’s peso rose against most major peers after an
unexpected decline in claims for  unemployment benefits  in the
U.S boosted the outlook for  Latin America ’s second-biggest
economy. The U.S. is Mexico’s biggest trade partner. Initial
jobless claims fell by 6,000 to 361,000 last week, compared with
a Bloomberg survey that forecast an increase to 370,000.  The Mexican currency advanced 0.5 percent to 13.0864 per
dollar, boosting its rally this year to 6.4 percent, the biggest
gain among the dollar’s 16 most-traded counterparts.  ECB officials are working on a plan to buy enough
 government bonds  to ease the region’s financial turmoil, bank
President  Mario Draghi  said after a policy meeting Aug. 2.
Details will be released in coming weeks, he said. The ECB held
its  benchmark interest rate  at a record low 0.75 percent.  The Fed said Aug. 1 after a meeting it “will provide
additional accommodation as needed” to spur growth and
employment. It refrained from action this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
