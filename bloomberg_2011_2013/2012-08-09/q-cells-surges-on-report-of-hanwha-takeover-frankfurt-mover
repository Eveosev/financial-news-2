Q-Cells SE (QCE) , the German solar-cell and
module maker that filed for insolvency in April, surged the most
since 2005 after Yonhap News reported that  South Korea ’s Hanwha
Chemical Corp. may complete a takeover by next week.  Q-Cells jumped 60 percent to 16 euro cents a share in
Frankfurt trading, valuing the Thalheim-based company at 28.4
million euros ($34.9 million).  Hanwha will probably complete a deal to take over Q-Cells
as early as next week, Yonhap reported, citing unnamed industry
sources.  Christoph Moeller, a spokesman for Q-Cells’ insolvency
trustee, called the report a rumor. “The business will continue
as usual, this is all I’ll say at the moment,” he said in a
phone interview.  Since December, at least six German solar technology
companies have filed for insolvency amid increased competition
and a glut of Chinese solar-modules that have dragged down
prices.  “Hanwha is a big player in the solar industry, so the deal
might fit,” Ingo Queiser, an analyst at Natureo Finance, said
by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
