England  prop Matt Stevens retired
from international competition, the Rugby Football Union said in
a statement.  The Saracens forward, 29, played 44 times for England,
including at the 2007 and 2011 World Cups. He called playing for
England the “ultimate honor” but said he wouldn’t be able to
commit to the national team through the next  World Cup  in
England in 2015.  “I have a young family and, conscious that I would not be
able to commit to the World Cup in three years, I have decided
the time is right to call it a day and focus on my rugby at
Saracens,” Stevens said in the RFU  statement .  Stevens made his England debut in 2004 while playing for
Bath. He was suspended in 2009 after testing positive for
cocaine. He joined Saracens upon his return in early 2011,
helping the team win the English Premiership title.  Stevens then resumed his international career and made the
squad for last year’s World Cup in  New Zealand , where he
appeared four times. He also came on as a substitute in all five
of England’s Six Nations games last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
