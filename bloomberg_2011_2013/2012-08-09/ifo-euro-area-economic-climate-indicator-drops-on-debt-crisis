The Ifo institute’s euro-area
economic climate indicator declined for the first time this year
as the debt crisis pushed the region toward recession.  The indicator, based on the forecasts of 274 economic
experts, fell to 88.9 from 100.3 three months ago, the Munich-
based Ifo institute said in a statement today. That’s the first
drop since the fourth quarter of 2011. A gauge assessing the
current situation fell to 103.5 from 114.7, while a measure of
expectations slumped to 80.3 from 91.3.  “The economy is not expected to pick up in the next six
months,” the institute said. “The debt crisis has flared up
again and is hampering economic activity in the euro area.”  Ireland and the Netherlands were the only two countries
with a “considerable” improvement in expectations, “pointing
to a modest recovery in economy activity,” Ifo said.  Euro-region inflation expectations also weakened, with
annual price gains now forecast to average 2.2 percent, down
from 2.4 percent, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
