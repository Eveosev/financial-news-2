U.S. financial regulators, responding
to the growth in trading securities over the Internet, want to
bolster protections for investors buying municipal bonds through
online brokers.  The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which drafts
regulations for the $3.7 trillion state-and-local  bond market ,
said today said it may place new requirements on online brokers,
such as collecting information about investors, sending out
educational material and drawing up procedures for meeting their
obligations -- including those aimed at preventing overcharging.  The municipal market is dominated by individuals seeking
tax breaks or safety of bonds sold by state and local
governments, which rarely default. Other bonds also backed by
specific revenue, including parking garage tickets or levies on
new housing developments, pose more risks to investors.  The board, based in Arlington,  Virginia , said the new rules
would be aimed at improving “the likelihood that individual
investors who trade online would understand the features and
risks of municipal securities and purchase securities that are
appropriate based on their financial condition and risk
tolerance.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
