Saudi Arabia ’s aviation regulator
will sell fuel to new international airlines bidding for a local
license at the same discount given to the national carrier,
Eqtisadiah  reported , without saying where it got the
information.  The new airlines will be allowed to operate any domestic
Saudi routes they choose and also have clearance for
international flights, the Riyadh-based newspaper said today.  The regulator last month shortlisted Bahrain’s Gulf Air,
Qatar Airways Ltd. and  China ’s  Hainan Airlines Co. (600221)  among seven
bidders for a license to operate domestic flights in the Kingdom
competing with state-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines. The Saudi
regulator will announce the winners of the license in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
