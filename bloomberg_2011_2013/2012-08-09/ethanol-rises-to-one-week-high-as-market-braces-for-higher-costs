Ethanol futures rose to the highest
level in more than a week as producers braced for more expensive
manufacturing costs.  Prices gained as corn hit a record a day before a U.S.
Department of Agriculture report that may show the government
slashed the corn-crop forecast to 10.929 billion bushels, the
smallest amount in six years, according to the average of 29
analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  “We’ve got a huge report coming out tomorrow and corn’s at
an all-time high,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at Price Futures
Group in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for September delivery advanced 4.8
cents, or 1.9 percent, to $2.626 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the highest level since July 31. Prices have gained 19
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in Chicago at
$2.59 a gallon and on the U.S. Gulf Coast at $2.64, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  sank 2 cents to $2.65 a gallon. On the
West Coast, the fuel jumped 9.5 cents to $2.785.  Corn for December delivery increased 7.25 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $8.2375 a bushel in Chicago. Prices touched a record
$8.2975. Futures have reached all-time highs four times in three
weeks. One bushel of corn makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
