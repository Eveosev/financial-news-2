A  European Aeronautic, Defence &
Space Co. (EAD)  unit in Britain is being probed by U.K. prosecutors
over allegations it paid bribes to win a telecommunications deal
with Saudi Arabia’s royal family.  The investigation involves suspected payments to Saudi
officials from EADS’s GPT Special Project Management unit,  David
Jones , a spokesman for the U.K.’s  Serious Fraud Office  in
London, said today in a phone interview.  The company provided officials with cars, jewelry and
briefcases of money through intermediaries to win the contract
valued at 2 billion pounds ($3.13 billion), the Telegraph
newspaper reported in May 2011, citing statements to
investigators by a former GPT employee.  “Certain allegations have been made and these are being
properly addressed with our full and constructive engagement,”
an EADS spokesman, who declined to be cited by name, said in a
statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
