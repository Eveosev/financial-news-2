Oil rose as much as 0.3 percent in
 New York  after data showed China’s inflation cooled for a fourth
straight month, providing more room to stem a growth slowdown in
the world’s second-biggest crude consumer.  Futures for September delivery climbed 18 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $93.53 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 10:09 a.m. in Singapore after
earlier falling as much as 0.1 percent. Prices dropped yesterday
for the first time in four days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
