Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) , the second-
largest U.S. natural-gas producer, received a subpoena in June
from the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice Departmentâ€™s
Midwest Field Office.  The subpoena comes amid an investigation into possible
violations of antitrust laws related to the purchase of oil and
gas rights, the Oklahoma City-based company said in a regulatory
filing today. The request calls for Chesapeake to provide
certain documents to a grand jury in the Western District of
Michigan, the company said.  Chesapeake also has gotten demands for documents and
information from some state government agencies related to other
investigations of buying and leasing oil and gas rights,
according to the filing.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  is the largest U.S. gas producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
