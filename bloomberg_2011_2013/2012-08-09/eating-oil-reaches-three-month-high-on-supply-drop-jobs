Heating oil rose to a three-month
high as U.S. distillate inventories fell to 19 percent below a
year earlier and a drop in jobless claims indicated the labor
market may be stabilizing.  Futures gained as distillate  supplies , including heating
oil and diesel, fell 724,000 barrels to 123.5 million last week,
according to Energy Department data. U.S.  applications  for
 unemployment benefits  fell 6,000 to 361,000 in the week ended
Aug. 3, Labor Department figures showed. Heating oil
outperformed crude oil and gasoline on the Nymex.  “This is on the back of the inventories,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition Energy in
Stamford,  Connecticut . “The supply situation is not good for
distillates.”  Heating oil for September delivery rose 1.59 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $3.0318 a gallon at 12:23 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices touched $3.036, the highest intraday
level since May 4.  The biggest inventory decline last week, 1.4 million
barrels, was in PADD 3, home to Gulf Coast refineries that
export diesel to  South America  and Europe.  Wholesale  demand  for heating oil and diesel increased 1.2
percent to 3.79 million barrels a day, the highest level in five
weeks. Heating oil futures are traded as a substitute for
diesel.  The crack spread, or premium of heating oil over crude,
based on September contracts, widened 33 cents to $33.65 a
barrel and touched $33.72, the largest gap since February.  Economist Forecasts  The  median  forecast of 43 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News called for jobless claims to increase to 370,000 in initial
jobless claims. The department revised the previous week’s
figure up to 367,000 from an initially reported 365,000.  “First-time jobless claims is a positive for the
economy,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price
Futures Group in Chicago.  Gasoline fluctuated as concern persisted that Europe’s
economy will weaken further, hurting fuel demand. The euro-
area’s economy will shrink 0.3 percent this year, larger than a
0.2 percent contraction predicted earlier, according to a
 European Central Bank  survey of professional forecasters.  “The jobs report was encouraging but the big question in
the market is whether the  Federal Reserve , as well as the
European Central Bank and China, are going to implement measures
to encourage growth,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  China’s  industrial-output  growth unexpectedly slowed in
July to a three-year low while investment and retail sales
missed estimates, increasing pressure on Premier  Wen Jiabao  to
step up efforts to support expansion.  Gasoline for September delivery rose 0.06 cent to $2.981 a
gallon on the Nymex, after fluctuating between $2.9634 and
$2.995.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, gained
1.5 cents to $3.662 a gallon yesterday, AAA data showed. That’s
the highest price since May 24. Prices are higher than a year
earlier for the first time since April, according data from the
nation’s largest motoring organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
