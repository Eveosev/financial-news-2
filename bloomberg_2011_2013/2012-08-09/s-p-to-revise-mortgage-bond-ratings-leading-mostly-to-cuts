Standard & Poor’s  said that it will
change its method of rating securities backed by U.S.
residential mortgages granted before 2009.  The adjustment will result in more downgrades than
upgrades, New York-based S&P said today in a statement. In a
sample of securities studied, two-thirds of the rating increases
would involve raising debt to CCC grades from CC, both among its
lowest rankings, the firm said. Certain types of AAA rated bonds
will all be lowered to AA+ or less, according to the statement.  Much of the $1 trillion of so-called non-agency home-loan
bonds without government backing have been cut to speculative
grades of less than BBB- after record defaults on the underlying
mortgages and declines in  home prices . S&P’s latest review will
be completed over the next six months, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
