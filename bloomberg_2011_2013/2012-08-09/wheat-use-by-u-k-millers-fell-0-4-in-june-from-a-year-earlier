Wheat use by U.K. millers in the
2011-12 season fell 7.8 percent from the previous year, while
brewers and distillers raised consumption of the grain, the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said.  U.K. millers, including makers of flour, starch and
bioethanol, processed 5.982 million metric tons of wheat in the
crop year through June, down from 6.491 million a year earlier,
Defra said in a  report  on its website today. In June, processing
totaled 551,600 tons, 0.4 percent less than the same month in
2011. The drop stemmed mostly from sliding  biofuel  demand, the
Home-Grown Cereals Authority said in a statement.  Brewers, malt makers and distillers used 662,100 tons of
wheat in the crop year, up 17 percent from the prior season, and
their barley demand rose 5.2 percent to 1.809 million tons,
Defra said. The industry’s barley use was the highest in eight
years, according to the HGCA, a Kenilworth, England-based
researcher.  “Strong demand for whiskey has driven production levels
higher,” the HGCA, a unit of the Agriculture and Horticulture
Development Board, said on its website following the release of
the Defra report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
