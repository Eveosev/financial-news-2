The U.S. beat Australia 119-86 to set
up a semifinal meeting tomorrow with 2004 Olympic men’s
basketball champion Argentina.  LeBron James had a triple-double -- 11 points, 14 rebounds
and 12 assists -- and  Kobe Bryant  led the U.S. with 20 points
against Australia last night in London.  Deron Williams 
contributed 18 points and  Carmelo Anthony  added 17.  “We knew that we were going to play a very athletic,
quick, well-coached team in Australia,” U.S. coach  Mike Krzyzewski  told reporters.  The U.S., which has won 13 gold medals in the 16 Olympic
tournaments it has entered, last lost at the games in the 2004
semifinals, when Argentina beat it 89-81 before claiming gold.  The defending champion has won all six of its games at the
2012 Olympics, including a 126-97 victory against Argentina in
the group phase of the competition.  Argentina (4-2) defeated Brazil 82-77 last night. Luis Scola of the  National Basketball Association ’s Houston Rockets
led Argentina with 17 points, while Manu Ginobili of the San
Antonio Spurs and Carlos Delfino of the Milwaukee Bucks scored
16 points apiece.  “We’ve had two tough games with them and we expect another
tough game,” Krzyzewski said. “They’re better together than
they are individually and individually you have two of the
greatest international players of all time.”  Tomorrow’s other semifinal will be between Russia (5-1),
which beat Lithuania 83-74, and Spain (4-2), which overcame
France 66-59.  The final is scheduled for Aug. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
