Kuwait’s government will ask the
 Constitutional Court  to decide on the legality of the country’s
election law, Information Minister Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah Al-
Sabah said, a move that could raise political tensions.  The government will refer the issue to the court by the end
of next week, Sheikh Mohammad told a press conference broadcast
live on state television. A number of legal experts agree that
the law is unconstitutional, the minister said.  Kuwait’s opposition movement, which includes Islamists,
liberals, independents and youth groups inspired by the Arab
Spring, has threatened to stage street protests if the
government refers the law to court. Its members have claimed
that such a move is a violation of the constitution and tampers
with the electoral system.  A new parliament was elected in February, when the
opposition won most of the 50 seats, only to be dissolved in
June when the court ruled that February’s election was void and
reinstated its predecessor. The opposition considers the
reinstated parliament, elected in 2009, to be illegal and
lawmakers have boycotted two sessions since July 31.  Kuwait, the fourth-biggest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, has had 10 Cabinets since
February 2006 and six parliamentary dissolutions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
