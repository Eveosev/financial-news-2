Treasury 30-year bond yields fell
from an eight-week high after a $16 billion auction of the
securities drove prices to levels that attracted investors.  The long-bond yield was little changed after rising as high
as 2.80 percent amid added evidence of employment gains. Jobless
claims unexpectedly dropped by 6,000 to 361,000 in the week
ended Aug. 4, Labor Department figures showed, eroding
speculation the  Federal Reserve  may expand monetary stimulus to
bolster the economy. Demand was less than average at today’s
sale and fell to the lowest level in three years at yesterday’s
10-year note auction.  “We’ve had a huge concession,” said  David Ader , head of
U.S. government bond strategy at CRT Capital Group LLC in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “This weakness that we’ve seen was about
setting up and just getting to a level that would generate some
interest.”  The yield on the current  30-year bond  was little changed at
2.76 percent in trading at 5 p.m. New York time, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3 percent security due in May
2042 declined 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 104
30/32.  The yield reached the highest level since June 13. It
touched a record low 2.44 percent on July 26.  Auction Results  At today’s auction, the  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing total bids with the amount of securities
offered, was 2.41 versus, compared with the 2.68 average at the
past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 36.7 percent of the bonds,
compared with percent at the July auction. The average for the
past 10 offerings is 31.4 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 7.7 percent,
the lowest since January and compared with 20.1 percent of the
securities at last month’s sale. The average at the past 10
auctions is 17.6 percent.  Primary dealers were awarded 55.6 percent of the offering
compared with an average 51 percent at the last 10 sales and the
most since April.  “The street bought them at a good price, the market held,
and you had some buying come in afterward,” said  Thomas Roth ,
senior Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities
USA Inc. “Customers were a little leery of taking it down at
that level because if it didn’t hold it would’ve gotten ugly.”  Market Results  Today’s sale completed this week’s note and bond auctions
totaling $72 billion. The Treasury sold $24 billion of 10-year
notes yesterday and $32 billion of three-year debt on Aug. 7.
The 10-year securities drew a bid-to-cover  ratio  of 2.49, the
lowest level since August 2009.  The difference in yields between Treasury two- and 10-year
notes widened to as much as 1.44 percentage points, or 144 basis
points, the most since May.  Investors should be wary of a steepening so-called yield
curve in the U.S. Treasury market, according to Pacific
Investment Management Co.’s Mohamed El-Erian.  While yields on  government securities  due in eight years
and less are anchored by Fed monetary policy, there is “a lot
more risk” in longer-maturity debt, El-Erian, the chief
executive officer of the world’s largest manager of bond funds,
said in a “Bloomberg Surveillance” radio interview with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt.  Inflation Measure  The gap between 10-year yields on Treasury Inflation-
Protected Securities and conventional U.S. government securities
reached 2.34 percentage points, the most since April 4.  The Fed’s favored bond-market gauge of inflation
expectations, the five-year, five-year measure forward breakeven
rate, which shows how much traders anticipate consumer prices
will rise during a period of five years starting in 2017, rose
to 2.56 percent on Aug. 6, the highest since June 12.  U.S. government securities have returned 1.9 percent in
2012, versus 7.8 percent for an index of investment-grade and
high-yield company debt, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch data. Company bonds yield 2.67 percentage points more than
Treasuries, with the difference narrowing from 3.48 percentage
points at the end of last year, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
data show.  The Fed purchased $1.6 billion of Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities maturing from January 2025 to February 2042
today, according to the  website  of its New York branch. The
purchases are part of the central bank’s effort to swap shorter-
term Treasuries in its holdings with those due in six to 30
years to put downward pressure on long-term borrowing costs.  European Factor  European Central Bank officials are working on a plan to
buy enough  government bonds  to ease the region’s financial
turmoil, bank President  Mario Draghi  said after a policy meeting
Aug. 2. Details will be released in coming weeks, he said. The
ECB held its benchmark  interest rate  at a record low 0.75
percent.  The Fed said Aug. 1 after a meeting it “will provide
additional accommodation as needed” to spur growth and
employment. It refrained from action this month.  “Markets are still trying to price in” the evolution of
the sovereign debt crisis in the European Union with Draghi
leading the ECB, said  John Briggs , a U.S. government bond
strategist at RBS Securities Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut, one
of 21 primary dealers required to bid at government debt
auctions. “For the first in three months we don’t have
something to be afraid of. There’s no Greek election, there’s no
EU summit meeting.”  Jobs Data  Jobless claims unexpectedly dropped by 6,000 to 361,000 in
the week ended Aug. 4, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast of 43 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for an increase to 370,000.  The data on U.S. jobless claims were available on the Labor
Department’s website at 5:10 p.m. yesterday, the department said
in an e-mail. Labor is conducting internal review of procedures.  Payrolls rose 163,000 in July following a revised 64,000
rise in June that was less than initially reported, Labor
Department figures showed Aug. 3 in Washington. The median
estimate of 89 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for
a gain of 100,000. Unemployment rose to 8.3 percent.  Thirty-year yields will decline to 2.70 percent by the end
of the third quarter, according to a Bloomberg survey of banks
and securities companies with the most recent projections given
the heaviest weightings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
