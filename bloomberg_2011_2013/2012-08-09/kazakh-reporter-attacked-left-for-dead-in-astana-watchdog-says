A Kazakh reporter was beaten and left
for dead, his body covered with stones, near his house in a
suburb of Astana, the country’s capital, a freedom of speech
watchdog said.  Ularbek Baitailak, who wrote for newspapers Dat and
Tortinshi Bilik and the Altyn Tamyr magazine, was hospitalized
after yesterday’s attack, Adil Soz International Foundation for
Protection of Freedom of Speech in Almaty  said  in a statement on
its website, citing a colleague of the reporter, Zangar
Karimkhan.  Kazakhstan, the biggest energy producer in central  Asia ,
was ranked 154th, alongside  Libya  and below Afghanistan and
 Iraq , among 179 countries in a 2011-2012 Press Freedom  Index  by
Reporters Without Borders. The authorities are cracking down on
independent reporters and tightening control of the Internet to
“maintain a facade of stability at all costs,” the Paris-based
monitoring group said in a January  report .  In April, Lukpan Akhmedyarov, a journalist with the
Uralskaya Nedelya newspaper, survived a knife and gun attack. A
court in the Kazakh city of Uralsk in July ordered Akhmedyarov
and his newspaper to pay 5 million tenge ($33,347) in damages to
a regional official for a story about the prevalence of nepotism
in local government institutions, according to  Adil Soz .  To contact the reporter on this story:
