Ivory Coast authorities stepped up
security across the commercial capital, Abidjan, after four
attacks on army targets within a week, Defense Minister Paul
Koffi Koffi said.  Three officials in charge of an army base that came under
fire on Aug. 5 were dismissed, Koffi Koffi told state
broadcaster Radio Television Ivoirienne late yesterday. Several
soldiers guarding an armory from which the assailants allegedly
stole weapons, have been jailed, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
