A veteran United Nations
troubleshooter, Lakhdar Brahimi, may succeed former UN
Secretary-General  Kofi Annan  as joint UN-Arab League special
envoy for Syria, diplomats said.  Brahimi, 78, a former Algerian foreign minister, has
handled difficult assignments in the past for the world body,
including serving as special representative and head of the UN
Assistance Mission in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2004. Previously,
he was the secretary-general’s special envoy for Afghanistan for
two years until October 1999.  As special representative for South Africa, he led the UN
Observer Mission from 1993 until the 1994 democratic elections
that installed  Nelson Mandela  as president of post-apartheid
South Africa. He has also taken on UN assignments in Iraq,
Haiti, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Yemen, Liberia,
Nigeria and Sudan,  according  to the UN.  An announcement may come as early as today, according to
three UN diplomats who asked not to be identified since
Brahimi’s assignment was still under discussion.  Reuters reported the expected appointment earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
