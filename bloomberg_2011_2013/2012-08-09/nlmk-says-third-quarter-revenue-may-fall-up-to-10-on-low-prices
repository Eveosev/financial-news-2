OAO Novolipetsk Steel,  Russia ’s
biggest steelmaker by market value, said third-quarter revenue
may fall 5 percent to 10 percent from the previous three months
because of low prices and poor export demand.  NLMK expects the “seasonal slowdown in international
markets to be aggravated by the sluggish macroeconomic
conditions,” according to a  presentation  today on its website.  Output will probably remain flat at 3.8 million metric tons
in the quarter, and the margin of earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization to revenue will remain at
16 percent to 18 percent on declining costs, NLMK said. Domestic
demand is likely to be “stable,” the company said.  NLMK today reported a 53 percent decline in second-quarter
net income to $278 million, compared with a year earlier. That
beat the average estimate of $260 million from five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
