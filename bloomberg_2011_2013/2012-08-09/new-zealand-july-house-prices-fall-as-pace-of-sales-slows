New Zealand  house prices fell from a
record high, the first drop in three months, as caution among
buyers caused sales to slow, a private report showed.  Prices dropped 0.7 percent in July after rising 1.7 percent
to a record high in June, according to an index from the Real
Estate Institute of New Zealand. Prices gained 1.3 percent in
the three months through July and 5.2 percent from a year
earlier, the Auckland-based institute said in an e-mailed
report.  Investors and the central bank are monitoring the housing
market to gauge how quickly inflation pressures may grow in the
New Zealand economy. Rising unemployment and a slower-than-
expected increase in wages during the second quarter are adding
to the case for policy makers to keep  interest rates  at a
record-low 2.5 percent until next year.  House sales rose 19.9 percent from July last year to 5,907,
today’s report showed. After adjusting for seasonal influences,
sales were little changed from June, the institute said.  “We are seeing recovery rather than boom conditions,”
Helen O’Sullivan, chief executive officer at the institute, said
in the statement. “Buyer caution is evident.”  It took 38 days to complete a sale in July compared with 37
days in June and 42 days in July last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
