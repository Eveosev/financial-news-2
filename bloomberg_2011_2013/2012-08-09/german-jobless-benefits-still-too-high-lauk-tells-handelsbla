Germany ’s welfare provisions for the
long-term unemployed are still too costly for the government and
too generous to encourage beneficiaries to find work, Kurt Lauk,
the head of the ruling Christian Democrats’ industry wing, said
in a guest column of the  Handelsblatt  newspaper.  While Germany is reporting record levels of employment,
about 2 million Germans are drawing long-term, so-called Hartz
IV benefits, Lauk said. Benefits add up in some cases to 2,000
euros a month ($2,474), creating a disincentive to find work, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
