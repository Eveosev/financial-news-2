Germany ’s Economy Ministry is
skeptical about the nation’s economy, saying the outlook faces
several risks, Handelsblatt reports.  While the ministry expects moderate growth for the second
quarter, it also sees a slowdown, the newspaper said, citing a
government report.  Exports, which grew 1.6 percent in the second quarter,
probably will grow at a more moderate rate in the future,
Handelsblatt said in a preview of an article for tomorrow’s
edition.  To contact the reporters on this story:
