Lions Gate  Entertainment Corp., the
independent film studio that produced “The Hunger Games,”
posted an unexpected first-quarter loss of $44.2 million, citing
costs to market five pictures.  The net loss amounted to 33 cents a share and compared with
profit of $10.3 million, or 8 cents a share, a year earlier,
Vancouver-based Lions Gate said yesterday in a statement. Sales
in the fiscal period ended June 30 rose 81 percent to $471.8
million, reflecting the takeover of  Summit Entertainment  and
beating the average analyst estimate of $447.3 million.  Results were hurt by a $90 million increase in movie
marketing costs tied to releases, including the horror picture
“The Cabin in the Woods” and the comedy “What to Expect When
You’re Expecting,” which Lions Gate predicted will be
profitable on an “ultimate basis.” The studio also cited
expenses of almost $10 million related to the Summit
acquisition.  “The takeaway is that Lions Gate expects all of those film
titles to be ultimately profitable,” said  Tuna Amobi , an
analyst with  Standard & Poor’s , in an interview. “When they can
say that, it’s a big thing. You spend upfront and realize the
benefits in a later quarter,” said Amobi, who recommends buying
the shares.  In the quarter, analysts were projecting a profit of 18
cents a share excluding items, the average of seven estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue increased on contributions from Summit and ticket
sales of “The Hunger Games.” The film, based on the Suzanne Collins young-adult novel, cost about $78 million to make and
generated $684 million in worldwide sales, according to  Box
Office Mojo . The movie was released on March 23, a week before
the first quarter began.  Lions Gate fell as much as 3.8 percent to $12.75 in
extended trading yesterday, after declining 2.8 percent to
$13.25 at the close in  New York . The shares have gained 59
percent this year.  (Lions Gate plans a conference call at 9 a.m. New York time
today at +1-800-230-1059 for U.S. callers and +1-612-234-9960
for others.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
