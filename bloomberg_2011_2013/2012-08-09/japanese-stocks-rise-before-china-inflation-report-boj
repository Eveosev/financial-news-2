Japanese  stocks  extended a three-day
rally after China’s inflation slowed a fourth month, widening
the scope for easing in Japan’s biggest export market amid
growing expectations for additional global monetary stimulus.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a maker of robotics used in Chinese factories,
added 1.8 percent.  Dowa Holdings Co. (5714)  soared 10 percent after the
metal smelter lifted its first-half earnings forecast.  Oki
Electric Industry Co. (6703)  plunged 34 percent, the most since at
least 1974, after it was put on notice for possible delisting on
reports of improper accounting at its Spanish unit.  “China’s slowing inflation will make it easier for the
country to relax policy, which will have a good impact on
exporters to China,” said Koichi Kurose, chief economist in
 Tokyo  at Resona Bank Ltd., which oversees the equivalent of $68
billion. “Investors have expectations for stimulus globally.
Such expectations bolster markets, and the economy will
accelerate.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 1.1 percent to 8,978.60
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, the highest since July 6. Volume
on the gauge was 26 percent above the 30-day average ahead of
the August futures settlement tomorrow, known as the “special
quotation.” The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index rose 0.8 percent to 751.84,
with almost three shares advancing for each that fell.  China’s consumer prices slowed to 1.8 percent in July from
a year earlier, the lowest since January 2010, the National
Bureau of Statistics said today. The inflation compares with the
1.7 percent estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 33 analysts and a
2.2 percent gain the month before. A commentary yesterday in
 China ’s Financial News said moderating price gains offer more
room for stimulus.  Exporters Advance  Exporters on the Nikkei 225, which get 27 percent of their
revenue abroad on average, advanced after the inflation report.
Fanuc gained 1.8 percent to 12,570 yen. TDK Corp., a
manufacturer of electronic parts that gets almost 30 percent of
its revenue from China, climbed 1.7 percent to 3,380 yen.  The Topix has rebounded 8.1 percent since this year’s low
on June 4 as central banks around the world ease policy to
support growth. The price of shares on the gauge stood at 0.9
times book value, compared with 2.2 times for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 times for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A
number less than one means that companies can be bought for less
than value of their assets.  Shares extended gains even after the  Bank of Japan 
refrained from expanding stimulus. Japan’s central bank kept its
asset-purchase fund at 45 trillion yen ($573 billion) and
lending facility at 25 trillion yen, according to a statement
released in Tokyo today. All 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
News predicted no change. The nation’s key rate was held near
zero.  Fed Remarks  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  added 0.3 percent today. The gauge
added 0.1 percent yesterday after falling as much as 0.4 percent
after Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President  Richard Fisher 
signaled opposition to more stimulus. Adequate measures are
already in in place and global central banks may not have
capacity to further easing policy, he said.  “There’s expectations policy makers may add stimulus
globally, allowing investors to hope the economy will rebound,”
said  Tomomi Yamashita , a senior  fund manager  at Shinkin Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo, which oversees $6.6 billion. “Japan’s
domestic demand is good, bolstered by firm consumption, while
external demand is bad due to the stronger yen.”  A third of the Topix’s 1,672 companies are scheduled to
release earnings this week. Of the 301 companies that have
 reported  since July 1 that have issued forecasts, 49 percent
have exceeded expectations, according to Bloomberg data.  Dowa Holdings surged 10 percent to 551 yen, the most on the
Nikkei 225, after boosting its first-half net income forecast 40
percent to 7 billion yen ($89.2 million), citing demand used in
car and chip related products.  Oki Plunges  Oki Electric  declined the most on the Nikkei 225, falling
34 percent to 81 yen, after the maker of automated teller
machines was put on a watchlist for possible delisting after its
Spanish unit overstated accounts. Oki was the Nikkei 225’s
strongest-performing stock this year through yesterday, surging
77 percent.  Nikon Corp. (7731) , which gets 25 percent of its revenue from
Europe, plunged 8.1 percent to 2,086 yen after the camera maker
cut its profit outlook, citing the strong yen against the euro.  -- With assistance from Toshiro Hasegawa in Tokyo. Editor:  Jim Powell   To contact the reporters on this story:
