What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Soybean futures are called to open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel
higher on signs of higher demand before a government report
tomorrow that is forecast to show the smallest U.S. crop in five
years, Sterling Smith, a commodity strategist at Citigroup
Global Markets in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  -- Corn futures may open 1 cent a bushel lower to 1 cent higher
as traders weigh forecasts for the biggest August cut in U.S.
production since 1974 against slowing demand after prices rose
to a record, Smith said.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent a bushel lower to 1 cent higher
on speculation that dry weather in Ukraine,  Canada  and the
southern U.S. Great Plains may reduce production as a 51 percent
jump in prices since June 1 slows overseas demand for U.S.
supplies, Smith said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
