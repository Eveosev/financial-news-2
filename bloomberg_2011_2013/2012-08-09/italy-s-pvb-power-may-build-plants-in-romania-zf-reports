PVB Power Spa , a closely-held Italian
company, may invest about 220 million euros ($272 million) in
micro hydro-power plants in  Romania ,  Ziarul Financiar  said,
citing representatives of the local authorities.  PVB Power, through its Bulgarian unit, plans to build seven
micro hydro-power plants on the Romanian Somes river as one of
the plants may be built in the Cluj county, the Bucharest-based
newspaper said, citing Horia Uioreanu, the head of the county.  Construction works on the plants may start in 2013 and last
about three years, Ziarul Financiar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
