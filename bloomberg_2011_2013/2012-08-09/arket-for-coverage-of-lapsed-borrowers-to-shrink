The market for insurance that
homeowners are required to buy when they lapse on existing
policies will contract, said Robert Hartwig, president of the
Insurance Information Institute.  “LPI premiums have peaked,” Hartwig said today at a
hearing in Atlanta held by the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners into so-called lender-placed insurance. “The LPI
market will shrink, probably dramatically.”  Assurant Inc. (AIZ)  and QBE Insurance Group Ltd. are among
companies that provide the coverage.  To contact the reporters on this story:
