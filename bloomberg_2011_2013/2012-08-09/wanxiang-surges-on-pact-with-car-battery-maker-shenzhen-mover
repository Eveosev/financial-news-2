(Corrects to show shares rose by the most since Nov. 14 in
second paragraph of story originally published Aug. 9)  Wanxiang Qianchao Co. (000559)  surged the most
in nine months in Shenzhen trading after its parent signed an
agreement to potentially takeover  A123 Systems (AONE)  Inc., a U.S.
maker of rechargeable automobile batteries.  The stock rose by the  10 percent  daily limit to 5.02 yuan,
the biggest one-day percentage gain since Nov. 14. China’s
benchmark Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.6 percent.  A123 Systems said yesterday it signed a non-binding
agreement under which Wanxiang Group Corp. could invest as much
as $450 million in the Waltham, Massachusetts-based company and
obtain up to an 80 percent stake in the battery maker. The
agreement would give Wanxiang Group, China’s largest auto-
components producer, technology needed for electric cars and
help it expand its businesses in the U.S.  The memorandum of understanding is “the first step toward
a longer-term agreement through which we plan to build on the
foundation A123 has established in the U.S.,” Lu Weiding,
Wanxiang Group’s chief executive officer, said in a statement.  After the agreement was announced yesterday, A123 rose 6.4
percent in  New York  trading, reducing the stock’s decline this
year to  69 percent . The shares have fallen after A123 in March
recalled batteries that made a Fisker Automotive Inc. car shut
down in a Consumer Reports test and the company in May reduced
its estimates for 2012 revenue.  Yesterday’s announcement also prompted a Florida lawmaker,
representative  Cliff Stearns , to say the agreement with Wanxiang
raised national security concerns.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
