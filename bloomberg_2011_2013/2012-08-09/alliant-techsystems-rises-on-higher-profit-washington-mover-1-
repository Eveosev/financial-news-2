Alliant Techsystems Inc. (ATK) , the U.S.
military’s largest ammunition maker, rose the most in nine
months as higher defense sales helped first-quarter earnings top
estimates. It raised its full-year forecast.  Alliant, known as ATK, increased 7 percent to close at
$51.94 in  New York , the biggest one-day gain since Nov. 3. The
shares have decreased 9 percent this year.  Profit  rose  4 percent to $70.8 million, or $2.16 a share,
in the fiscal quarter ended July 1, from $67.8 million, $2.02 a
share, in the year-ago period. Analysts had predicted profit of
$1.42 a share, the average of 12 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  “ATK recorded a solid quarter with strong program
execution and orders flow and increased ammunition sales
volume,” Chief Executive Officer Mark DeYoung said in a
statement today.  The Arlington, Virginia-based company raised its full-year
profit forecast to between $7 and $7.30 a share from between
$6.25 to $6.55 a share.  Sales advanced less than 1 percent to $1.08 billion from
the year-earlier period. Higher sales in defense and a
commercial ammunition and accessories unit were partly offset by
a decrease in the aerospace segment.  “The market has beaten up ATK over the last several
months, but Q1 results should be enough to give it a boost, even
if they were largely driven by Radford contract close-outs,”
Joseph Nadol, a JPMorgan equity analyst in New York, wrote today
in a note to clients. He was referring to a defense contract the
company lost this year to  BAE Systems Plc. (BA/)   The Pentagon on Jan. 24 awarded London-based BAE a contract
to operate the Radford Army Ammunition Plant near Radford,
Virginia. ATK had held the contract, valued at as much as $850
million over 10 years, since 1995.  To contact the reporter on this story:
