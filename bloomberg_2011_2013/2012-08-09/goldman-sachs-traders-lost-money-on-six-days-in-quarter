Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , which
relies on trading for more than half its revenue, posted losses
from that business on six days in the second quarter, down from
15 days in the same period last year.  The firm’s traders made more than $100 million on four of
the 63 days in the quarter ended June 30, compared with one day
in the year-earlier period, the New York-based company said in a
quarterly regulatory  filing  today.  Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest  U.S. bank  by  assets , last
month reported its lowest first-half revenue since 2005 as
revenue from trading stocks, bonds and other securities dropped
6 percent from a year earlier. That followed a 21 percent
decline in trading revenue for all of 2011, the worst
performance since 2008.  Trading losses during the second quarter never exceeded
Goldman Sachs’s value-at-risk limit, a measure of how much the
company estimates it could lose in the securities markets in a
single day, according to the filing. Average daily value-at-risk
dropped to $92 million in the three months ended June 30 from
$95 million in the prior three months, the firm said on July 17.  “While it’s just one measure of risk, $92 million is the
lowest it’s been since the third quarter of 2006,” Chief
Financial Officer David A. Viniar said in a conference call with
investors and analysts on July 17.  Morgan Stanley (MS) , the sixth-biggest U.S. bank, said this week
its traders lost money on 15 days during the second quarter, up
from eight days a year earlier.  Bank of America Corp. , the No. 2
U.S. lender, reported last week that it had trading profits on
60 of the 63 days in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
