Brazil ’s economic growth will
accelerate in the second half of the year, said Aldo Mendes, the
central bank director for monetary policy.  Mendes, who spoke today at an event in Sao Paulo held by
Brazil’s  capital markets  association, also said inflation is
converging toward the bank’s target of 4.5 percent.  He said the reduction of the benchmark Selic rate will lead
to growth of the longer-term financing needed for infrastructure
projects and corporate expansions. Mendes cited bank bonds as an
example of a financial instrument that “in a short amount of
time has become important for financial institutions to raise
funds.”  “With the reduction of rates and spreads, the financial
markets’ horizons will expand and capital markets will deepen,”
Mendes said. “We have good fundamentals, our financial system
is solid and the government is adopting important measures to
increase productivity and competitiveness.”  The bank has cut the benchmark rate by 4.5 percentage
points since August to a record low 8 percent. Annual inflation
quickened to 5.2 percent in July, from 4.92 percent the month
before, the national statistics agency said Aug. 8. The bank
targets inflation of 4.5 percent plus or minus two percentage
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
