Usain Bolt is one win away from
completing an unprecedented double that he said will bring him
sprinting immortality.  Bolt jogged over the finish line last night at the Olympic
Stadium in  London  in a time of 20.18 seconds to qualify for the
200-meter final. He said he planned it that way.  “You can’t work too hard, you’ve got the finals,” Bolt
told reporters. “That was the aim. You can’t push too hard.”  The 25-year-old Jamaican said after running an Olympic
record 9.63 to defend his 100-meter title that he also needed to
retain the 200-meter crown to become “a legend.” Victory
tonight would make him the first man to take gold in the 100 and
200 meters at consecutive games.  Bolt, one of the most recognized athletes in the world, is
the only person to have run below 9.60 in the 100 meters and
under 19.20 in the 200 meters. He broke his own world records in
the 100 and 200 meters at the 2009 world championships in
Berlin.  The 6-foot-5 Bolt, who only took up the 100 meters as speed
work to prepare for the longer sprint, may not have things all
his own way in his favorite event.  Blake Threat  Yohan Blake, the silver medalist in the 100 meters, beat
Bolt in the Jamaican 200-meter trials, raising the prospect that
he could shock his training partner at the Olympics. Blake
slowed to win his 200 semifinal in 20.01.  “The race was a walk in the park,” said the 22-year-old,
whose 19.26 at a meet in Brussels on Sept. 16 is the  second
fastest  all time, 0.07 slower than Bolt’s world record.  Commentators including former 100-meter Olympic champion
Maurice Greene said they favored Blake over Bolt in the shorter
sprint.  In the event, Bolt surged through to win comfortably, even
though he gritted his teeth and leaned over the line, something
he didn’t do when winning in 2008.  “That’s how people are,” Bolt said. “They’re always
doubting a champion. But that’s why I’m here, to cement my
legendary status. I’m focused and I’m ready.”  The sprinter may get a workout with 19-time English soccer
club Manchester United,  Yahoo Sports  reported. Bolt is a
supporter of the team, and told journalists that he thinks he
could play for United.  Wallace Spearmon of the U.S.,  France ’s Christophe Lemaitre
and Churandy Martina, who lost the 200-meter silver medal in
Beijing after being disqualified for stepping out of his lane,
also advanced to the eight-man final.  Felix Wins  After last night’s men’s 200-meter semifinals, Allyson Felix, 26, of the U.S. claimed gold in the women’s event.  The three-time world champion, the Olympic silver medalist
in 2004 and 2008, clocked 21.88 to beat 100-meter champion
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who got silver, and Carmelita Jeter of
the U.S., who took bronze. Two-time defending champion Veronica Campbell-Brown of  Jamaica  finished out of the medals.  Also last night, Aries Merritt and  Jason Richardson  gave
the U.S. a 1-2 finish in the men’s 110-meter hurdles. Merritt,
27, won in 12.92 seconds, with Richardson crossing the line in
13.04. Hansle Parchment of Jamaica took bronze in 13.12.  Brittney Reese won the women’s long jump gold, only the
second American to do so in 24 years. Two-time world champion
Reese, 25, won with a leap of 7.12 meters (23 feet), the best
since the 1996 games. Elena Sokolova of  Russia  took silver and
American Janay Deloach got bronze.  Natalya Antyukh, a 31-year-old Russian, won the 400-meter
hurdles in 52.70, the fastest time this year. Lashinda Demus of
the U.S. came second, ahead of Czech Zuzana Hejnova.  To contact the reporters on this story:
