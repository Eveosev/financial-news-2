United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s biggest
aluminum producer, said physical premiums will continue to rise
in the next 12 to 18 months as so-called financing deals tie up
metal stockpiles and demand grows.  About 65 percent of aluminum stockpiles monitored by the
London Metal Exchange are locked in financing deals and aren’t
available to consumers, said Steve Hodgson, Rusal’s director for
international sales. Supply disruptions and production cuts have
exacerbated the market tightness, he said.  “Premiums may fall if demand should significantly reduce,
or if a rise in interest rates makes financing deals
unprofitable,” Hodgson said in an e-mailed response to
questions Aug. 7. “Neither scenario looks likely in the next 12
to 18 months and we would expect to see premiums continue to
strengthen during this period.”  Premiums paid on top of the LME price have rallied to a
record in  Europe , the U.S. and  Japan  as low  interest rates 
fueled demand for financing deals, according to Morgan Stanley.
These transactions involve a simultaneous purchase of metal for
nearby delivery and a forward sale to take advantage of a market
in contango, when contracts with later delivery dates trade at
higher prices than nearer-dated metal. Immediate delivery
aluminum traded at discount of $37.25 a ton to the three-month
contract today, the widest contango since June 28.  This year premiums in Europe have gained 83 percent to $200
to $210 a ton, duty unpaid, and those in the U.S. are up 43
percent at 10.75 cents a pound, both at records, according to
Platts, a unit of New York-based McGraw-Hill Cos.  Lowest Price  Aluminum for three-month delivery fell 0.6 percent to
$1,904 a ton by 11:41 a.m. on the LME. The metal used in
everything from aircraft to beverage cans dropped to $1,832.25 a
ton on June 27, the lowest price since June 7, 2010.  “The Western markets are being very strongly influenced by
the absence of physical material,” said  Peter Richardson , chief
metals economist at Morgan Stanley in  Melbourne . “But the cash
price is indicating clearly that the market is in surplus on a
recurrent basis despite production cuts, and is probably going
to continue to reflect that in a weaker cash price.”  About 5.4 million tons of aluminum capacity is loss-making
at the current LME price, Hodgson said. The amount falls to 4.76
million tons if premiums are taken into account, he said.  Rusal expects producers around the world to cut about 4.5
million tons, or 8.7 percent of global capacity, before the end
of the year, Hodgson said. Smelters outside  China  have so far
shut about 1.49 million tons of aluminum capacity since the
start of the year, with another 150,000 tons of cuts expected
before year-end, he said.  “The main difference from 2008-09 is that the physical
demand remains firm in all regions except Europe,” Hodgson
said. “Metal consumers have previously destocked and have
stronger balance sheets than in 2009, hence we are seeing stable
demand rather than the boom-bust liquidation of stocks that
defined the previous crisis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
