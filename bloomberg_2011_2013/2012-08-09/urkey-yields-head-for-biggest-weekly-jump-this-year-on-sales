Turkey ’s bond  yields  headed for the
biggest weekly jump this year as weaker demand for government
debt and the central bank cutting funding by half spurred sales.
The lira retreated.  Yields on two-year benchmark fixed-income securities rose
for a fourth day, surging 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage
point, to 7.84 percent at the close in Istanbul. It has climbed
35 basis points so far this week, the most since Dec. 30. The
lira weakened 0.2 percent to 1.7851 per dollar, paring its
appreciation this year to 5.9 percent.  The Treasury will sell 3.1 billion liras ($1.74 billion) of
Sept. 11, 2013 bonds next week to meet its debt sale target of
16 billion liras this month, more than double the total for the
previous three months. Investors bid for 1.06 times the amount
sold in an auction of benchmark debt two days ago, the lowest
bid-to-cover ratio since at least January 2008, according to
Bloomberg data. The central bank today lent 3 billion liras in
the one-week repurchase agreements auction at its lowest 5.75
percent policy rate, half the amount it provided a week earlier.  Demand at the debt auction was “poor and the central bank
squeezed liquidity today,” Erkin Isik, a fixed-income
strategist at  Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS (TEBNK) , said in e-mailed
comments. “This appears to be a signal that the bank will not
loosen its policy further.”  The  average cost of funding  from the central bank for
Turkish lenders fell to 6.84 percent two days ago, the least
since November 2011.  “According to our calculations, that rate has now risen to
7.01 percent,” Ali Cakiroglu, a strategist at  HSBC Private Bank 
in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed note.  Central bank Governor Erdem Basci introduced an interest-
rate corridor in October to execute the bank’s unique monetary
policy, switching between rates of 5.75 percent and 11.5 percent
on a daily basis to tame inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
