The port of  Thessaloniki (OLTH) , Greece’s
second-biggest, said it’s almost doubled its capacity to load
and unload ships with dry bulk cargo, as part of an effort to
boost dry freight traffic.  The port acquired three derrick loading machines, each with
a capacity of more than five cubic meters (almost 177 cubic
feet), at a cost of 722,400 euros ($891,500), bringing the total
number of such machines to eight,  Thessaloniki Port Authority SA 
said in an e-mailed statement today.  The port’s capacity to process dry bulk such as nickel has
thus almost doubled, according to the statement.  The volume of dry bulk and general cargo passing through
the port in the first half increased more than 43 percent to
almost 2.6 million metric tons, boosted by so-called transit
cargo arriving from, or destined for, Greece’s northern
neighbors such as  Bulgaria , the authority said Aug. 1.  The government may sell stakes in Thessaloniki Port and
 Piraeus Port (PPA)  as part of a program of state asset sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
