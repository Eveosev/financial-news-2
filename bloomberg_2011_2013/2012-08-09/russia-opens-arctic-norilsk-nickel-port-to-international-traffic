Russia opened OAO GMK Norilsk
Nickel’s Dudinka port in the Arctic to international cargo and
passenger traffic, making it the northernmost such facility in
the world, Norilsk said in a statement today.  “Before opening of the permanent checkpoint, import and
export cargoes were cleared through customs in Murmansk and
Arkhangelsk seaports, as well as in the ports of the  Far East ,”
Norilsk said. “Now, the marine vessels carrying out
international routes may be shipped directly in Dudinka with
registration of all the required border and customs documents.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
