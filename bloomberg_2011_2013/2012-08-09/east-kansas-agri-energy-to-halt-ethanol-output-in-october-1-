East Kansas Agri-Energy LLC, an
ethanol producer, plans to stop output at its Garnett, Kansas,
plant in October because drought in the Midwest has made the
operation unprofitable.  The plant can produce 42 million gallons of the renewable
fuel a year and began output in 2005. Record corn prices and
scarce supply forced the  company  to shutter the operation
possibly until after the 2013 harvest, Bill Pracht, company
chairman, said in a telephone interview.  “The drought is most of the reason,” Pracht said in a
telephone interview. “It’s just the unavailability of bushels
and then record corn prices. You put the two together and it
just doesn’t make it” profitable.  Corn for December delivery rose 9.75 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to a record $8.2625 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel of the grain
makes about 2.75 gallons of the biofuel.  Denatured ethanol for September delivery climbed 3 cents,
or 1.2 percent, to $2.608 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices have gained 18 percent this year.  The U.S. Agriculture Department will cut its corn-harvest
estimate by 16 percent tomorrow to 10.929 billion bushels, the
smallest in six years, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
analysts.  Ethanol  output  in the U.S. has fallen 15 percent to 817,000
barrels a day in the week ended Aug. 3, from a record on Dec.
30, Energy Department data show.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , the third-biggest U.S. ethanol
producer, is operating its ethanol output at about 50 percent of
capacity because of the higher corn prices, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer  Bill Klesse  said July 31.  Poet LLC, in  Sioux Falls , South Dakota, is the largest U.S.
ethanol producer, followed by  Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM)  in
Decatur, Illinois.  To contact the reporter on this story:
