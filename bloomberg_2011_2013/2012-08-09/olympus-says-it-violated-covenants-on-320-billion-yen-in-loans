Olympus Corp. (7733)  said it violated
covenants related to 320 billion yen ($4 billion) in  loans  as it
delayed and restated earnings reports last year after admitting
to accounting fraud.  The maker of cameras and medical probes will have to pay a
higher-than-normal fee to amend the  covenants , according to a
person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified
because the details are private. Miho Uratani, a Tokyo-based
spokeswoman for Olympus, declined to comment on any discussions
with lenders.  The company plans to make the payment, normally between 20
basis points and 30 basis points of the total interest amount,
by the end of September and is in talks with  banks , the person
familiar with the matter said today. Olympus, which has about
$5.8 billion of bonds and loans due to mature before the end of
2019, restated earnings last year after admitting it paid
inflated fees on takeovers and overpaid for three Japanese
companies to conceal past investment losses.  The yield on Olympus’s 25 billion yen of 2.15 percent notes
due 2018 rose 1 basis point to 5.855 percent as of 3:38 p.m. in
 Tokyo , JSP prices compiled by Bloomberg show. The securities
were yielding 5.76 percent as of July 2, the prices show. The
yield on the company’s 20 billion yen of 1.58 percent notes due
2013 was little changed today at 4.53 percent.  Increased Loss  Olympus shares  dropped  as much as 2.8 percent to 1,425 yen
in Tokyo trading immediately following the announcement today
about covenant violations. The stock changed hands at 1,434 yen
at the close of trading in Tokyo.  Separately, the camera-maker reported results today for the
three months ended June 30.  Net loss widened to 4.5 billion yen in the three months
ended June 30, compared with a 1.4 billion yen loss a year
earlier, the company said today in a statement. Olympus left its
forecast for annual net income of 7 billion yen unchanged.  The company’s new management team, led by a former  Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316)  banker Yasuyuki Kimoto, is
considering alliance offers from  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Fujifilm Holdings
Corp. (4901)  and  Terumo Corp. (4543)  after revelations of the fraud wiped more
than $3 billion off its market value.  To contact the reporters on this story:
