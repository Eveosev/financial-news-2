All Angolan crude cargoes for loading
in September have been sold except for one lot, according to
four traders who participate in the market.  A Nemba crude consignment for loading on Sept. 25 to Sept.
26 has yet to find a buyer, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the information is confidential. The speed at
which the shipments have been sold was typical for this time of
the month, the people said.  Angola plans to export 51 cargoes totaling 1.63 million
barrels a day of crude in September, compared with 60 shipments
for August, according to a shipping schedule obtained by
Bloomberg News. The export program for October is scheduled to
be released next week.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
