OAO Alrosa,  Russia ’s largest diamond
miner, plans to bid for OAO Nizhne-Lenskoye, a competitor in
Yakutia region that mines alluvial gems.  Alrosa applied to the antitrust regulator for permission to
acquire Nizhne-Lenskoye from the regional government, the
watchdog said today on its  website . Andrey Polyakov, a spokesman
for Mirny, Siberia-based Alrosa, confirmed the application.  Alluvial diamonds are gems that are unearthed by natural
erosion and deposited in river or sea beds. Nizhne-Lenskoye,
which has operations near one of Alrosa’s production sites, sold
4 billion rubles ($126 million) of rough diamonds last year,
according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
