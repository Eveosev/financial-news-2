The Australian dollar touched a
four-month high for the third day this week as data showed the
nation’s employers added more jobs in July than forecast.  The currency’s gains were limited as global risk appetite
ebbed and U.S. stocks fluctuated.  New Zealand ’s currency fell
against most of its 16 major counterparts as the nation’s
unemployment rate rose to the highest level since 2010.  The Aussie dollar gained 0.1 percent to $1.0580 yesterday
in  New York  and reached $1.0613, the highest level since March
20. The currency rose 0.2 percent to 83.14 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, for fell a third
day, dropping 0.5 percent to 81.19 U.S. cents. It fell 0.2
percent to 63.80 yen.  Australian payrolls increased by 14,000, the statistics
bureau said in Sydney yesterday, exceeding the 10,000 predicted
in a Bloomberg News survey. The jobless rate fell to 5.2 percent
from a revised 5.3 percent in June.  Employment unexpectedly fell in New Zealand in the second
quarter, according to the country’s statistics agency in
Wellington. Payrolls declined 0.1 percent from the first
quarter, when they rose 0.4 percent. Economists  surveyed  by
Bloomberg News forecast a 0.4 percent gain. The jobless rate
increased to 6.8 percent, from 6.7 percent, exceeding the median
economist estimate of 6.5 percent.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index ended the day up less than
0.1 percent after falling 0.2 percent and rising 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
