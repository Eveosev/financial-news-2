The U.S. Energy Department’s natural-
gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington , will show that supplies rose 0.9 percent last week,
according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The government’s report will show that inventories gained
30 billion cubic feet in the week ended Aug. 3 to 3.247 trillion
cubic feet, according to the survey.  Bloomberg compiles the anonymous survey based on estimates
by at least 100 users each week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
