Norway’s krone weakened for the first
time in four days against the euro after technical gauges
signaled the rally that pushed it to the strongest level in more
than nine years was poised to stall.  The krone depreciated the most against the dollar among the
greenback’s 16 major counterparts.  Norway’s currency “has gone very fast and we have
certainly entered territory now where the risk of a temporary
correction is increasing,” said Kasper Kirkegaard, a senior
currency strategist at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen. “For the
medium-term outlook, we are still very positive on the Norwegian
economy and the krone.”  The Norwegian currency fell 0.3 percent to 7.2879 per euro
at 4:33 p.m. London time after appreciating to 7.2585 yesterday,
the strongest level since January 2003. The krone dropped 0.9
percent to 5.9304 per dollar.  The currency’s so-called 14-day relative-strength index
against the euro climbed to 70.5 yesterday, above the level of
70 that some traders use as an indicator that an asset has risen
too quickly and is poised to decline.  To contact the reporters on this story:
