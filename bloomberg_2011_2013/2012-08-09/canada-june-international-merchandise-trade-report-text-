The following is the text of
 Canada ’s international merchandise trade report for June
from  Statistics Canada .  Canada’s merchandise imports rose 2.3% while exports edged
up 0.2% in June. As a result, Canada’s trade deficit with the
world widened from $954 million in May to $1.8 billion in June.  Imports continued their upward trend and reached a record
high of $40.9 billion in June. Overall, six out of seven sectors
registered gains, the main contributor being the machinery and
equipment sector. Volumes (+2.5%) were up in all sectors.  Exports increased to $39.1 billion. Volumes rose 1.1%,
while prices decreased 0.9%. A strong gain in exports of
automotive products helped offset declines in five out of seven
sectors.  Imports from the  United States  grew 3.0% to a record high
of $25.9 billion in June, a third consecutive monthly increase.
Exports rose 2.2% to $29.0 billion. This narrowed the  trade
surplus  with the United States from $3.2 billion in May to $3.1
billion in June.  Imports from countries other than the United States
increased 1.1% to $15.0 billion. Exports to countries other than
the United States fell for the third consecutive month, down
5.2% to $10.1 billion. Consequently, Canada’s trade deficit with
countries other than the United States widened from $4.2 billion
in May to $4.9 billion in June.  Machinery and equipment leads imports  Imports of machinery and equipment increased 3.2% to a
record high of $11.2 billion in June. Volumes were up 3.0%.
Imports of other machinery and equipment led the gain in the
sector, followed by industrial and agricultural machinery.  Imports of other  consumer goods  rose 4.7% to $5.3 billion.
Imports of miscellaneous end products, mainly medicinal and
pharmaceutical products, led the gain on higher volumes.  Imports of industrial goods and materials rose 2.3% to $8.5
billion, the third consecutive monthly increase. Widespread
gains throughout the sector were led by imports of plastic
materials and other iron and steel products.  The only sector to decline in June was energy products,
down 3.6% to $4.2 billion. Prices fell 9.2%. Imports of crude
petroleum decreased 18.2% to $2.2 billion, as both volumes and
prices fell. In contrast, petroleum and coal products registered
strong gains in volumes, mainly on higher imports of light oils
and preparations.  Strong gains in exports of automotive products  Exports of automotive products rose 13.9% to $6.3 billion
in June as volumes were up 13.2%. The main factor was exports of
passenger autos and chassis, which increased 19.5% to $4.3
billion, the highest level since January 2006.  Exports of energy products fell 3.5% to $9.0 billion, as
prices fell for the fifth consecutive month. The main
contributor was crude petroleum exports, which declined 5.3% to
$5.6 billion.  Exports of agricultural and fishing products declined 2.8%
to $3.5 billion, the lowest level since August 2011. Leading the
decline was a 27.4% decrease in wheat exports, on lower volumes.  In the machinery and equipment sector, exports declined
1.3% to $7.2 billion as volumes fell 2.5%. Lower exports of
aircraft and other transportation equipment were the main
contributor to the decline.  Note to readers  Merchandise trade is one component of Canada’s
international balance of payments (BOP), which also includes
trade in services, investment income, current transfers as well
as capital and financial flows.  International merchandise trade data by country are
available on both a BOP and a customs basis for the United
States,  Japan  and the  United Kingdom . Trade data for all other
individual countries are available on a customs basis only. BOP
data are derived from customs data by making adjustments for
factors such as valuation, coverage, timing and residency. These
adjustments are made to conform to the concepts and definitions
of the Canadian System of National Accounts.  Data in this release are on a BOP basis, seasonally
adjusted and in current dollars. Constant dollars are calculated
using the Laspeyres volume formula.  For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal
adjustment and identifying economic trends
( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-010-x/2010003/part-partie3 -
eng.htm) .  New aggregation structure  Statistics Canada will introduce the North American Product
Classification System (NAPCS) for merchandise import and export
statistics. The new structure will replace the classification
structures known as the summary import groups (SIG) and the
summary export groups (SEG) and the higher level aggregations
(major groups, subsectors, sectors and sections) that have been
in use for several decades.  Revised data based on NAPCS for the reference period of
January 1988 to August 2012 will be disseminated on October 18.  The first regular release of data based on NAPCS will be on
November 8 for the September reference month.  Readers interested in this upcoming change can find more
detailed information on our web page dedicated to classification

consultation and notification.  Revisions  In general, merchandise trade data are revised on an
ongoing basis for each month of the current year. Current year
revisions are reflected in both the customs and BOP based data.  The previous year’s customs data are revised with the
release of the January and February reference months as well as
on a quarterly basis. The previous two years of customs based
data are revised annually and are released in February with the
December reference month.  The previous year’s BOP based data will be revised with the
release of the January, February, March and April 2012 reference
months.  Factors influencing revisions include late receipt of
import and export documentation, incorrect information on
customs forms, replacement of estimates produced for the energy
sector with actual figures, changes in classification of
merchandise based on more current information, and changes to
seasonal adjustment factors.  Revised data are available in the appropriate CANSIM tables,
free of charge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
