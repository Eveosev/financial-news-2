PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) , the world’s largest
snack food maker, will return to Myanmar after 15 years to
distribute beverages under loosened restrictions on investment
in the Southeast Asian country.  Diamond Star Co. has exclusive rights to import, sell and
distribute Pepsi-Cola, 7-Up and Mirinda, Purchase,  New York- 
based PepsiCo said today in a statement. PepsiCo also said it
plans to explore building manaufacturing plants in Myanmar.  PepsiCo pulled out of Myanmar in 1997 after activists urged
the company to sever ties with the military dictatorship because
of human-rights violations.  Coca-Cola Co. (KO) , the world’s largest
soft-drinks maker, will return to the country after 60 years as
soon as the U.S. government licenses the investment, the
Atlanta-based company has said.  PepsiCo will develop agricultural projects and vocational
training in Myanmar, according to the statement. Jeff Dahncke, a
PepsiCo spokesman, declined to say whether they will distrubute
snacks in the country.  Myanmar is enhancing economic, military and political ties
with Western nations after years of isolation that left its 64
million people among  Asia ’s poorest. The country’s transition to
democracy in recent months after about five decades of military
rule prompted the U.S. to ease sanctions in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
