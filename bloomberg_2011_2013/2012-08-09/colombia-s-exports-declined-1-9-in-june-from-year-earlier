Colombia ’s exports fell 1.9 percent
to $4.6 billion in June compared with the same month last year,
the government statistics agency said today in a report on its
website.  The central bank cited the slowing world economy and
reduced prices for Colombian exports in its surprise decision to
cut interest rates last month for the first time since 2010.  Central bank chief Jose Dario Uribe told lawmakers in
Bogota yesterday that he would like the peso to be “a bit more
devalued.”  The European debt crisis has affected China, leading to
lower prices for Colombia’s commodities exports, Uribe said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
