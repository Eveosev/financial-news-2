General Electric Co. (GE)  is recalling
about 1.3 million dishwashers after electrical failures sparked
fires that caused “extensive” property damage.  “Consumers should stop using these dishwashers immediately
and disconnect the power,” Inez Moore Tenenbaum, chairman of
the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, said today at a
Washington news conference.  The units were sold from March 2006 to August 2009 under
brand names including GE Adora, GE Eterna, GE Profile and
Hotpoint for as much as $850, the agency said in a statement. It
said seven fires were reported among 15 heating-element
failures, with three blazes causing “extensive” damage.  Owners should contact GE for free repairs or vouchers
toward the purchase of a new unit, the commission said. The
company alerted the commission to the fire risk, Kim Freeman, a
spokeswoman for GE’s appliances division, said in an e-mail.  GE is investing $800 million to upgrade its appliance
factory in Louisville,  Kentucky , and revamp product lines such
as refrigerators and water heaters. That includes $150 million
to redesign dishwashers and buy more parts for the machines from
U.S. sources, according to an Aug. 6 statement.  The shares climbed 0.2 percent to $21.06 at the close in
 New York . Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE rose 18 percent this
year, compared with a 12 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
