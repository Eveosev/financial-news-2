Edinburgh Airport reinstated a print
of Picasso’s “Nude Woman in a Red Armchair” in the
international arrivals lounge after it was covered up following
complaints by some passengers.  The airport covered the print, which promotes an exhibition
of Picasso and  Modern Art  at the  Scottish National Gallery  of
Modern Art, with white vinyl yesterday.  “The initial decision was a reaction to passenger
feedback, which we do always take seriously,” said a
spokeswoman for Edinburgh Airport in an e-mailed statement.
“However on reflection we are more than happy to display the
image in the terminal and we apologise, particulary to the
exhibition organisers, for the confusion.”  BAA Ltd. sold its Edinburgh terminal,  Scotland ’s busiest
airport, to U.S. buyout firm Global Infrastructure Partners Ltd.
for 807.2 million pounds ($1.3 billion) in April after antitrust
operators ordered a breakup.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
