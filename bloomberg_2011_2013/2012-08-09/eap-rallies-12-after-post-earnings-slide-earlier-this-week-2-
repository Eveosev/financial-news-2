Leap Wireless International Inc. (LEAP) 
rallied 12 percent in  New York  today, the biggest one-day gain
since Nov. 30, as the stock recovered from a post-earnings
selloff that dragged it down 20 percent over two days.  The shares climbed to $4.96 at the close in New York,
paring their year-to-date decline to 47 percent. The stock had
fallen over the previous two days, following the loss of almost
300,000 subscribers in the second quarter.  Leap, a pay-as-you-go wireless carrier, signaled this week
that the company could be sold, saying it was evaluating “all
options” to squeeze more value from its assets. Leap’s wireless
spectrum alone is worth $3 billion, Chief Financial Officer
Jerry Elliott said on a conference call. Leap’s market value is
$404.8 million.  Michael Mahoney , a senior managing director at Falcon Point
Capital LLC in  San Francisco , said shareholders would be well
served if San Diego-based Leap gets a 15 percent premium on its
enterprise value -- between $3.5 billion and $4 billion for the
spectrum and the business.  NII Holdings Inc., another wireless carrier that saw its
stock battered after disappointing earnings this week, rose
today as well. Shares of the Reston, Virginia-based company
climbed as much as 13 percent to $7. The stock was down 71
percent this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
