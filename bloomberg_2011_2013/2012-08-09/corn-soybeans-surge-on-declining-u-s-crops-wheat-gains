Corn surged to a record, leading
rallies in soybeans and wheat, on mounting signs that the worst
U.S. drought since 1956 will erode production from farmers that
are the world’s largest exporters of the crops.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture , in a report tomorrow,
probably will cut its domestic corn-crop forecast to 10.929
billion bushels, the smallest in six years, according to the
average estimate of 29 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. That
would be down 16 percent from a July  forecast , the biggest
August reduction since 1974. The estimate for soybeans may drop
8.3 percent to 2.796 billion bushels, the smallest since 2007.  Corn prices through yesterday were up 61 percent since mid-
June and soybeans rallied 20 percent, while the government rated
the condition of the U.S. crop on Aug. 3 as the worst since
1988. Output threats are being compounded by dry weather in
 Russia  and below-average monsoon rains in  India . Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. is among the banks forecasting prices will keep
rising, and the  United Nations  reported today the biggest gain
in global food costs since 2009.  “This year’s crops are a disaster,” Dale Schultz, the
buyer-relations manager for AgWest Commodities LLC in Holdrege,
 Nebraska , said in a telephone interview. “We have to raise
prices and reduce demand immediately to prevent a real shortage
developing in January or February. There is so much competition
for every bushel of grain this year.”  Prices Rally  Corn futures for December delivery rose 1.3 percent to
$8.2675 a bushel at 11:12 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
after touching a record $8.2975. Prices have reached all-time
highs four times in three weeks.  It may be too late for the corn crop to recover,  Dennis
Gartman , an economist, wrote today in his daily Gartman Letter.
“What rains may develop in the next few weeks shall have
little, if any, effect on the crop’s size” because plants are
too mature to recoup yields, he said. Most of the fields will be
harvested in September and October.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 2.9 percent to
$16.2675 a bushel, heading for the biggest gain since July 25.
The most-active contract touched a record $16.915 on July 23.
Wheat futures for December delivery advanced 1.5 percent to
$9.2725 a bushel on the CBOT, heading for the third increase
this week.  Crops are the best-performing commodities this year.
Goldman, Macquarie Group Ltd. and Credit Suisse Group AG say
prices will continue to rise. World cereal costs surged 17
percent in July, the most since February 2008, the same month
wheat futures touched a record in  Chicago , the UN’s Food &
Agriculture Organization reported today.  Declining Conditions  About 69 percent of the Midwest, where U.S. farmers
harvested 60 percent of last year’s crop, had moderate to
exceptional  drought  conditions as of Aug. 7, the highest since
the government-funded  U.S. Drought Monitor  in Lincoln, Nebraska,
began tracking the data in 2000.  About 50 percent of the corn and 39 percent of soybeans in
the U.S. were in poor or very poor condition as of Aug. 5, the
worst for that date since at least 1988, government data show.
The USDA reduced its outlook for domestic corn output by 12
percent on July 11, a month after predicting a record harvest.
U.S.  soybean  production was cut 4.8 percent to the smallest crop
in four years.  The world could face a food crisis of the kind seen in 2008
if countries restrict exports due to concerns about a drought-
fueled grain price rally, the UN’s FAO said today, after
reporting a 6.2 percent surge in global food prices last month.  Food-Price Riots  World food costs are still 10 percent lower than the record
set in February 2011 and 4.9 percent below a previous peak in
2008, according to the UN agency. The U.S. State Department
estimates that surging food prices triggered more than 60 riots
worldwide from 2007 to 2009.  “The combination of rising prices and expected low
reserves means the world is facing a double danger,” Colin
Roche, a spokesman for humanitarian group Oxfam International,
said today in a statement. “This is not some gentle monthly
wake-up call. It’s the same global alarm that’s been screaming
at us since 2008.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show. Wheat is the fourth-largest at $14.4 billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
