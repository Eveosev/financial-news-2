The BP Plc-led Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline delivered 10 percent less crude oil in the first seven
months from a year earlier.  The line, known as BTC, shipped 17.88 million metric tons
of oil in January through July, down from 19.87 million tons a
year earlier, according to data published today on the website
of State Oil Co. of  Azerbaijan , or Socar. The Baku-based energy
producer is a partner in BTC. No reason was given for the drop.  The  pipeline , connecting BP’s Sangachal terminal south of
the Azeri capital of Baku to  Turkey ’s Mediterranean port of
Ceyhan through Georgia, exports oil from the offshore Azeri-
Chirag-Guneshli and Shah Deniz fields, also operated by BP.  Azerbaijan’s crude oil production declined in the first
half by 7.1 percent to 22.2 million tons, the State Statistics
Committee said last month. The third largest oil producer in the
former  Soviet Union  pumped 45.6 million tons of oil and 25.8
billion cubic meters of natural gas last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
