German  government bonds  fell, with
10-year yields rising toward the highest in a month, amid
speculation central banks will step in to stimulate growth after
China’s inflation and industrial production slowed.  Two-year notes also declined as European stocks advanced.
 Spain  and Italy’s credit ratings were downgraded yesterday by
DBRS Inc., which cited a weakening growth outlook in the
countries and deteriorating funding conditions. DBRS is one of
the four companies accepted by the  European Central Bank  to rate
the securities it takes as collateral.  The German 10-year yield rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.45 percent at 8:02 a.m. London time after
rising to 1.49 percent on Aug. 7, the highest level since July
4. The 1.75 percent bond due in July 2022 fell 0.275, or 2.75
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 102.735.  The two-year yield climbed one basis point to minus 0.04
percent. It dropped to minus 0.097 percent on Aug. 2, the  lowest 
since Bloomberg began tracking the securities in 1990.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index of shares gained 0.4 percent.  German debt returned 3.3 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities fell 4.3 percent and Italy’s debt rose 9.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
