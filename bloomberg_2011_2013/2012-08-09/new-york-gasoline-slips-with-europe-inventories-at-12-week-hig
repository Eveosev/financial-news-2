New York  gasoline weakened as
inventories of the fuel in  Europe  reached the highest level
since May, raising incentives to ship cargoes to the U.S.  Gasoline stockpiles in independent storage climbed 6.8
percent in Europe’s Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil-trading hub,
according to PJK International BV. It is the highest level since
May 18.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor slipped 2.5 cents to 12.5 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:14
p.m., data compiled by Bloomberg showed. Prompt delivery dropped
1.83 cents to $3.1057 a gallon.  Imports of gasoline to the East Coast dropped to 383,000
barrels a day in the week ended Aug. 3, the lowest level for
shipment to the region since April, the Energy Department
reported.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Midwest, or Group 3, fell 1.38 cents to 1 cent a gallon versus
futures.  HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC) ’s Tulsa refinery has cut crude
processing rates by 30,000 to 40,000 barrels a day while repairs
that may last eight weeks are under way on a diesel
hydrotreater, David Lamp, the company’s chief operating officer,
said during a conference call with investors yesterday.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel at the Group 3  hub 
versus Nymex heating oil futures rose 2.25 cents to 23 cents a
gallon.  The Tulsa refinery has also shut a 65,000-barrel-a-day
crude unit in the East portion of the plant, Lamp said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
