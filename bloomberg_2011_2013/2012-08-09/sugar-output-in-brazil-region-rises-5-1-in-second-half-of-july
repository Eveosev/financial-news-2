Sugar output in  Brazil ’s center
south, the world’s largest-producing region, increased 5.1
percent in the second half of July after dry weather allowed
mills to step up harvesting.  Output of 2.97 million metric tons between July 16 and July
31 compares with 2.83 million tons a year earlier, Sao Paulo-
based Unica said in an e-mailed report today. The crop year
started April 1.  Growers harvested 46.3 million tons of cane in the second
half of July, from 41.8 million tons a year ago. Ethanol output
was 1.78 billion liters (470 million gallons), up 3 percent.  Mills in the center south, which accounts for about 90
percent of Brazil’s sugar and ethanol, turned 50.6 percent of
the cane into sugar. That compares with 50.1 percent a year
earlier. The rest was turned into ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
