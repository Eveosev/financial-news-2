Gold reached a one-week high in
London on slowing Chinese inflation and expectations that a
report may show rising U.S. jobless claims, boosting optimism
central banks might take steps to bolster the global economy.  Growth in China’s industrial production also cooled in
July, and central banks in Japan and  South Korea  saw little sign
of price pressures, underscoring the scope for monetary stimulus
should the  European debt crisis  deepen. Weekly U.S.  jobless 
claims rose to 370,000, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
economists before the Labor Department issues the figure today.  “Any relaxation of monetary policy is likely to be very
positive for gold,” said Saeed Amen, an analyst at Nomura
International Plc in London. “Gold isn’t fully pricing in
further easing.”  Bullion for immediate delivery gained 0.2 percent to
$1,615.19 an ounce by 8:58 a.m. in London. Prices reached
$1,618.80, the highest level since July 31. December-delivery
gold rose 0.1 percent to $1,617.70 on the Comex in New York.  “There is still QE thinking in the background of  gold
prices ,” said  David Lennox , a resource analyst at Fat Prophets
in Sydney, referring to quantitative easing. “It won’t go away
until we see the U.S. in full recovery mode. That’s certainly
not happening at the moment.”  The  Federal Reserve  said Aug. 1 it would add stimulus if
necessary to boost growth and cut an  unemployment rate  that has
been 8 percent or higher for more than three years.  Consumer prices in China rose 1.8 percent from a year
earlier, the lowest rate since January 2010, said the National
Bureau of Statistics. Retail sales weakened and growth in
industrial production was below 10 percent for a fourth month
and at the lowest level since 2009, data showed.  Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by gold gained
0.3 percent to 2,411.7 metric tons yesterday, the highest since
July 6, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Silver for immediate delivery added 0.4 percent to $28.1563
an ounce. Platinum climbed 0.5 percent to $1,416.12 an ounce,
the highest since Aug. 3. Palladium rose 0.5 percent to $590.08
an ounce, the highest since Aug. 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
