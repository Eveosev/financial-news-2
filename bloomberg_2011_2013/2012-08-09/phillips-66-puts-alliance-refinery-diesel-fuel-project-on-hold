Phillips 66 (PSX)  is holding off on
starting a project that would boost ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel
output at its Alliance  refinery  in  Louisiana .  The company received a permit on July 25 to expand a diesel
hydrotreater and gulfining unit, according to a filing with the
state’s Department of Environmental Quality. That would allow
the units to remove more sulfur to meet emissions regulations.
The permit will expire on Jan. 25, 2014.  Phillips 66 is “re-evaluating the timing of the project
based on market economics,”  Rich Johnson , a Houston-based
company spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. “Reviewing
economics such as supply and demand forecasts for our product
will be taken into consideration as part of the long-range
planning cycle we use to determine what capital projects we want
to invest in.”  Johnson declined to comment further on the project.
Alliance can  produce  120,000 barrels per day of heating oil,
diesel and jet fuel, according to a company report.  The company has decided not to sell the refinery as it had
considered earlier this year, Greg Garland, chief executive
officer of Phillips 66, said in a second-quarter earnings
conference call.  “There were a handful of offers and none of them we really
regarded as approaching whole value for the asset,” Garland
said in an earnings call with investors and analysts on Aug. 1.  The Alliance refinery can process as much as 247,000
barrels per day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
