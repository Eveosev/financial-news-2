Grain exports from the French port of
Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, jumped almost
fourfold in the latest week as cargoes for North Africa resumed.  Shipments increased to 56,425 metric tons between Aug. 2
and Aug. 8 from 14,510 tons a week earlier, the  Seine River port 
wrote in an e-mailed report today. Deliveries of soft wheat,
which accounted for all of the prior week’s cargoes, climbed to
49,025 tons.  Algeria was the largest soft-wheat buyer in the latest
period. The previous week was the fifth in which no grain was
dispatched to North Africa from Rouen, the longest stretch in at

sea in 2010-11, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay, with a
share of 17 percent, and Dunkirk on the  North Sea , at 11 percent
of the total, according to port figures.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in metric tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
