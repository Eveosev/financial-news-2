AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC) , the third-
biggest U.S. drug distributor, was subpoenaed by federal law
enforcement agencies for information about the company’s ability
to keep controlled substances, such as painkillers, from ending
up in the wrong hands.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office in  New Jersey  and the Drug
Enforcement Agency on May 4 asked a unit of the Chesterbrook,
Pennsylvania-based company how it keeps controlled substances
away from inappropriate users, the company said in a filing
today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  “The subpoenas also request documents concerning specific
customers’ purchases of controlled substances,”
AmerisourceBergen said in the filing. The company said it is
cooperating with the investigations.  Law enforcement agencies including the DEA have been
cracking down on so-called “pill mills” where drug abusers
seeking pain drugs like oxycontin buy them in large quantities.
In 2011, U.S. sales of prescription painkillers amounted to $9
billion, according to IMS Health. Oxycontin is an opioid
painkiller that’s classified as a “schedule II” drug by the
agency, which means it has high potential for abuse.  Matthew Reilly, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman
in New Jersey, declined to comment on the subpoenas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
