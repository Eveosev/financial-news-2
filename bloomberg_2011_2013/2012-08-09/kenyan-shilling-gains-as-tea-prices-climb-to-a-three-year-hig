Kenya ’s shilling gained to the
strongest in more than a week on increased inflow of dollars
after tea prices rose to the highest in more than three years at
an auction.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy appreciated
0.3 percent to 83.85 a dollar, the highest on a closing basis
since July 30, by 4:28 p.m. in Nairobi.  The best tea, known as broken peko 1, climbed to $4.16 a
kilogram (2.2 pounds) from $3.34 a kilo a week earlier, Tea
Brokers East Africa Ltd, said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday.  “The prices are the highest since at least July 2009 and
they are being driven by lower global production,” Peter
Kimanga, chairman of the East Africa Tea Trade Association in
Mombasa, said in a phone interview.  Central Bank of Kenya sold 3 billion shillings ($36
million) of seven-day  repurchase agreements  at a weighted
average yield of 9.84 percent, a central bank official, who
asked not to be named in line with policy, said today. That
compares with the 9.07 billion-shilling the bank received in
bids.  The Tanzanian shilling gained less than 0.1 percent to
1,576 a dollar, increasing for the first time in three days.
 Uganda ’s shilling weakened less than 0.1 percent to 2,480 a
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
