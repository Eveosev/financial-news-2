A venture part-owned by the family of
 Brisa-Auto Estradas de Portugal SA ’s chairman raised its stake
in the highway operator to 85 percent after completing a bid for
the company.  The Tagus Holdings Sarl venture, owned by Jose de Mello
SGPS SA, a holding company for one of  Portugal ’s richest
families, and Aeif Apollo Sarl, raised its bid in July to 2.76
euros a share from the 2.66 euros a share it offered on March
29. Aeif Apollo and Jose de Mello already owned a combined 50
percent Brisa stake and 54 percent of its voting rights.  Tagus acquired 211.7 million shares in the offer for 584.2
million euros ($717.6 million). Brisa holds 7.87 percent of its
own stock, the  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  Lisbon exchange said today in an e-
mailed statement. Brisa, Portugal’s seventh-biggest company by
market value, will be excluded from country’s benchmark PSI-20
stock index starting Aug. 13.  Jose de Mello Chairman Vasco de Mello, who is also Brisa’s
chairman and chief executive officer, said Tagus was able to
secure more than 90 percent of Brisa’s  voting rights  and will
consider delisting the toll-road company, which is based in the
Lisbon suburb of Sao Domingos de Rana.  “The strategic objectives of the Jose de Mello Group and
Arcus were fully achieved,” Mello told journalists at a
conference in Lisbon.  Aeif is a unit of London-based Arcus Infrastructure
Partners LLP.  To contact the reporters on this story:
