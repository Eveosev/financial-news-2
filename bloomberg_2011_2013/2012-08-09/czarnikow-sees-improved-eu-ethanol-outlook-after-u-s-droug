Surging corn prices and policy
changes in the U.S. and European Union mean the outlook for the
EU’s ethanol industry has “improved dramatically” this year,
Czarnikow Group Ltd. said.  U.S. ethanol prices have rallied as drought damaged corn
crops in the Midwest, making the European biofuel more
competitive, the London-based company said today in an e-mailed
statement. The  U.S. Congress  allowed an ethanol tax credit for
refiners to expire last year, and the EU tightened  regulations 
on imports in March. Better prospects for profits may encourage
plants to boost output, Czarnikow said.  “The closing of loopholes, coupled with the U.S. drought,
have leveled the playing field for  Europe ’s ethanol producers,”
Toby Cohen, a director at Czarnikow, said in the statement.
“Healthier margins should now incentivize more production. But
longer term, Europe has more work to do to encourage further
investment, through better legislation.”  Denatured ethanol futures have jumped 21 percent since mid-
June on the Chicago Board of Trade, tracking a 60 percent surge
in corn prices on the same exchange. The Department of
Agriculture has declared more than half of U.S. counties as
disaster areas because of drought. In late July, U.S. ethanol
 output  tumbled to the lowest since the Energy Department began
tracking the data in 2010.  The outlook for European ethanol is more uncertain in the
medium term because many countries in the bloc have reached
their blending limits, and economic concerns have hurt gasoline
demand, Czarnikow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
