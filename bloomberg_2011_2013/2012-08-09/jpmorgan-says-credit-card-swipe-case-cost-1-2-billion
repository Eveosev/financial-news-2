JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the biggest
U.S. credit-card lender, will contribute about $1.2 billion to
settle a price-fixing case brought by retailers over credit-card
swipe fees.  JPMorgan agreed to cover about 20 percent of a $6.05
billion deal to settle claims that the bank conspired with
 MasterCard Inc. (MA)  and  Visa Inc. (V)  to rig credit-card processing
fees, the New York-based bank said today in a filing.  Visa and MasterCard, the world’s biggest payment networks,
and some of the largest U.S. banks agreed last month to pay
merchants $6.6 billion and temporarily reduce credit-card swipe
fees, or interchange, to settle the antitrust lawsuit. The deal
includes cash payments of $6.05 billion to merchants who take
part in the proposed class action and $525 million to individual
plaintiffs. The larger amount would be reduced if some
plaintiffs don’t agree to participate.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the second-biggest U.S. credit-card
lender, said last week that it will contribute a total of $738
million to settle the case.  Citigroup Inc. (C) , the No. 3 card
issuer, said in an Aug. 3 filing that second-quarter expenses at
its North America consumer bank climbed 5 percent to $2.45
billion, an increase “driven entirely” by a boost in legal
reserves tied to the litigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
