Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  increased
liquefied natural gas imports by 4 percent from a year ago to
fuel thermal-power plants that are providing a greater share of
the nation’s energy since the Fukushima nuclear disaster.  The utility known as Tepco imported 2.1 million metric tons
of LNG last month, up from 2 million in the same period last
year, according to  data  released today on its website.  Tepco’s coal purchases rose 45 percent to 462,000 metric
tons, while fuel oil purchases increased 18 percent to 552,000
kiloliters. Crude purchases fell 54 percent to 128,000
kiloliters.  Tepco, Japan’s biggest utility, has operated no nuclear
reactors since it halted the No. 6 unit at its Kashiwazaki
Kariwa atomic station in northwest  Japan ’s Niigata prefecture on
March 26 for scheduled maintenance.  The following table shows Tepco’s consumption and purchases
of fuel oil, crude, LNG and coal for July. For fuel oil and
crude, the volume is in kiloliters, while LNG and coal are in
metric tons.
