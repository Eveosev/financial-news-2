Taiwan’s government bonds fell after
South Korea left  interest rates  unchanged, reducing speculation
the island will cut borrowing costs. The local dollar advanced
on stock inflows.  The  Bank of Korea  kept borrowing costs at 3 percent today
after a surprise cut in July, a decision predicted by 10 of 16
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Global funds bought $661
million more Taiwanese shares than they sold today, taking net
purchases for the week to $1.5 billion, exchange data show.  “There were some banks betting on a rate cut by South
Korea yesterday, so now they’re disappointed,” said  Albert Lee ,
a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at Cathay United Bank Co.
“The current yield level is pricing in a rate-hold scenario in
Taiwan too.”  The yield on the 1.25 percent notes due March 2022 climbed
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.19 percent in
Taipei, the highest level in a month, according to Gretai
Securities Market.  Taiwan and South Korea’s economies are both export-oriented
and focus on technology-related industries such as semiconductor
chips and smartphones. The island’s monetary authority kept the
 discount rate  for 10-day loans at 1.875 percent in June, and its
next meeting is scheduled for September.  The  Taiwan dollar  gained 0.2 percent to NT$29.940 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
a one-month high of NT$29.830 yesterday. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, dropped 17 basis points to 3.45 percent.  The  overnight money-market rate  was little changed at 0.386
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
