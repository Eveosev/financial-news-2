Carl Pettersson holds a two-shot
lead over Tiger Woods and  Vijay Singh  at the  PGA Championship ,
where gusting winds have sent scores soaring during the second
round of golf’s final major tournament of the year.  Pettersson holed out a wedge shot from greenside sand on
his 10th hole for a birdie to reach 6 under par at the Ocean
Course in Kiawah Island, South Carolina.  Woods, 36, has two birdies and a bogey in his first 11
holes today and is tied at 4 under with Singh, the 49-year-old
two-time champion from Fiji, who shot 1-under 69 today.  Of the 78 players who teed off this morning, Singh was one
of only three to break par compared with 44 under-par rounds
yesterday morning.  “It’s very challenging,” 2005 champion  Phil Mickelson 
said after a 1-under round of 71. “You’ve got to tackle these
crosswinds and it’s very difficult to play through the air.”  High winds led to slower play today, causing tee times to
be delayed 20 minutes. An overnight thunderstorm dumped almost
three inches of rain on the course and produced windy, overcast
conditions for the second round.  John Daly , the 1991 champion, bogeyed his first three holes
today and is at 1 under. Daly, 46, an American who tied for
fifth at last week’s Reno-Tahoe Open, hasn’t advanced past two
rounds at the PGA since 2007, when he tied for 32nd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
