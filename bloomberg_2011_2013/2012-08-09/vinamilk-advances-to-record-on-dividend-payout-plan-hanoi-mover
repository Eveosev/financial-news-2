Vietnam Dairy Products Joint-Stock
Co. (VNM) , the nation’s biggest listed dairy producer, advanced to a
record in Ho Chi Minh City trading after the company said it
will pay a dividend next month.  Vinamilk, as the company is known, climbed 2.9 percent to
105,000 dong at the 2:15 p.m. local-time close. The benchmark  VN
Index (VNINDEX)  added 0.8 percent. The shares gained 12 percent last week.  The company will pay shareholders a dividend of 2,000 dong
a share on Sept. 6, it said in a statement filed on the Ho Chi
Minh City Stock Exchange’s website today.  The dividend is “attractive to investors,” said Vu Hoang Viet, a Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst at Viet Capital
Securities Co. “Now is the chance for investors to buy more
shares to receive more cash dividends.”  Vinamilk said in a statement last week it’s also seeking
approval from shareholders to issue 278 million bonus shares in
December or January.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
