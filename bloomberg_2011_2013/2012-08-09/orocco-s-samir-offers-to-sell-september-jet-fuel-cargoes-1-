Societe Anonyme Marocaine de
l’Industrie du Raffinage, the Moroccan refiner known as Samir,
issued a tender to sell 70,000 metric tons of jet fuel from its
Mohammedia facility, according to a company official.  The  jet fuel  will be sold in two cargoes, one for loading
on Sept. 10 to Sept. 15 and the other on Sept. 28 to Sept. 30,
the company official said today by phone, declining to be
identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media.  Samir also issued a tender for the sale of 40,000 tons of
 diesel  that closed yesterday, the official said, without giving
any further details.  The refiner raised the capacity of its Mohammedia plant to
200,000 barrels a day following an upgrade, Asharq al-Awsat
reported, citing Samir. The plant had an output of 129,000
barrels prior to the expansion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The company started a new crude distillation unit and a jet
fuel facility on Aug. 7 that can produce 600,000 tons a year,
the Pan-Arab newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
