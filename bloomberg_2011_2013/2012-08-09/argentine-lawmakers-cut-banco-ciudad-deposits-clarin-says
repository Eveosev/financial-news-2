Argentina â€™s lower house approved a
bill that will order national and federal courts to send
judiciary deposits to the Banco de la Nacion Argentina instead
of to the Banco de la Ciudad de  Buenos Aires , newspaper Clarin
reported.  The bill, approved by 128 votes to 4, will reduce Banco de
la Ciudad deposits by 1.2 billion pesos ($261 million) per year,
the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said. The proposal must be
approved by the Senate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
