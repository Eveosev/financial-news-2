Coffee exports from  Ecuador ,  South
America ’s second-biggest producer of Robusta beans, surged 23
percent in June to its highest level this year as changes in
rain patterns boosted harvests that month.  Ecuadorean farmers exported 144,788 bags in June, up from
117,335 bags last year, the National Coffee Council, known as
Cofenac, said today in an e-mailed statement. Above-average
rainfall, which lasted through May, delayed harvests of Arabica
beans by about two months coinciding with the beginning of
Robusta collection in June, Luis Duicela, director of Cofenac’s
technical division, said today in a telephone interview from the
city of Manta.  Ecuador, which is also the world’s biggest producer of
 cocoa beans  used in fine chocolate, declared a state of
emergency in March in five provinces after above-average
rainfall in the coastal region and southern Andean foothills
washed away roads and houses and damaged more than 34,000
hectares (84,000 acres) of crops.  The adverse weather will probably shrink this year’s
Arabica exports to 630,000 bags, or about 5 percent less than
the council previously estimated, Duicela said.  “Harvest times for Arabica and Robusta this year have
practically coincided in the same months,” Duicela, an
agricultural engineer, said. “However, in general terms there
will be lower production this year compared to last” because of
the rains.  A bag weighs 60 kilograms, or 132 pounds. Brazil, Colombia
and  Peru  are South America’s top exporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
