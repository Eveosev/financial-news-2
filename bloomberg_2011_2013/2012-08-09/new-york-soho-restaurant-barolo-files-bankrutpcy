Barolo Ltd., owner of a  New York 
restaurant frequented by celebrities, businessmen and tourists,
filed for  bankruptcy protection  saying it’s facing eviction.  The restaurant listed assets and debt of as much as $10
million in its filing yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. It’s largest creditor is 81st & 5th Realty Co., which
has a $1.5 million claim, according to court filings.  Barolo has operated in New York’s fashionable SoHo
neighborhood for 25 years, said Paolo Secondo, Barolo Ltd.’s
president and sole stockholder, in court filings. The 400-seat
restaurant, located on West Broadway, began paying reduced rent
under an agreement with the landlord in 2004, according to the
filing.  In 2010, the landlord demanded the back rent owed and
sought an agreement for the restaurant to vacate, according to
the filing. The restaurant pays $110,000 a month in rent and the
landlord has said the premises is worth much more now and could
command higher rent. Barolo said its 30-year lease expires in
2018.  The case is In Re Barolo Ltd., 12-13389,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
