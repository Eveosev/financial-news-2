Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISATR)  AS’s capital
adequacy ratio may fall between 50 basis points and 60 basis
points as Turkey’s banking industry switched to  Basel II ,
Bloomberg HT television reported today, citing bank’s chief
executive Adnan Bali.  Isbank’s capital adequacy ratio was 14.2 percent at the end
of June, compared with 14.1 percent at the end of 2011,
according to earnings statements the bank sent to the Istanbul
Stock Exchange yesterday.  An increase in non-performing loans in the Turkish banking
industry is “not a surprise” and “can be managed without
causing any losses,” Bali said, according to the Istanbul-based
news channel.  Isbank rose 0.8 percent to 5.24 liras at 10:23 a.m. in
Istanbul. The main market index gained 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
