The  European Central Bank  should
follow through on recent pledges by President  Mario Draghi  and
start buying Portuguese and Irish government debt,  Portugal ’s
President Anibal  Cavaco Silva  said.  “Why not have the ECB start applying now the orientation
announced by its president to public debt securities from
Portugal and Ireland,” Cavaco Silva said in a message posted on
his  Facebook page  today, referring to Draghi’s pledge to buy
 government bonds  in tandem with the euro region’s rescue fund.  The ECB is stepping up its crisis response in a bid to
lower Spanish and Italian bond yields and to prevent the
sovereign debt crisis from spreading further. For Portugal, one
of five states in the single-currency area to seek external aid,
a bond-buying scheme may help the government fulfill its aim of
returning to markets next year. The yield on Portugal’s 10-year
bonds is hovering around 10 percent.  “Any intervention from the European Financial Stability
Facility and the ECB, even on a small scale, could have an
important psychological effect and pull borrowing costs to still
more manageable levels,”  Sarah Hewin , head of research in
Europe for Standard Chartered Plc, said by e-mail.  “On the other hand, Portugal will probably prefer to
escape the stigma of being under a bailout program if it
possibly can, so would hope to do without further EFSF and ECB
support,” she said.  Cavaco Silva said there should be no more delays in
“clarifying the support mechanisms to countries that face
greater difficulties in the markets,” adding that no more room
for maneuver should be given to those that “bet on the
dismemberment of the euro zone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
