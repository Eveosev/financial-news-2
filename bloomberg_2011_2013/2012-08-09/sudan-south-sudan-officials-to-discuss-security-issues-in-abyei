Sudanese and South Sudanese officials
will meet tomorrow in the disputed town of Abyei to discuss
security issues,  Sudan ’s Foreign Ministry said.  Delegates from both countries will discuss transitional
arrangements for the Abyei area, al-Obeid Murawih, a spokesman
for the ministry, said in a phone interview today from Khartoum,
the Sudanese capital.  “Reconciliation in the area between the Misseriya
tribesmen and the Ngok Dinka tribes will be also discussed,”
Murawih said.  Abyei is contested between the region’s Ngok Dinka people,
who are settled in the area and consider themselves southerners,
and Misseriya nomads who herd their cattle south in the dry
season and are supported by the government in Khartoum.  The Permanent Court of Arbitration in  The Hague , in a 2009
ruling, set Abyei’s borders to the area around Ngok Dinka
settlements. That largely excluded the Misseriya, who say that
as seasonal inhabitants of the area, they should also have the
right to vote.  Sudan’s army seized Abyei town in May last year after
accusing  South Sudan ’s security forces of attacking its troops
two days before while they were withdrawing from the region with
a United Nations convoy. Sudanese forces withdrew in May 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
