Copper rose after data showed  China ’s
inflation cooled for a fourth month in July and industrial
output missed analysts’ estimates, raising expectations of
further measures to revive growth in the world’s largest user.  The three-month contract advanced 0.3 percent to $7,575 a
metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at 3 p.m. in  Shanghai .
Futures for September-delivery climbed 0.4 percent to $3.4365 a
pound on the Comex.  “The weaker-than-expected industrial production means the
demand is weak,” He Shan, an analyst at Galaxy Futures Co.,
said by phone from Beijing. “In the meantime, expectations of
growth-supportive measures continue to linger.”  Industrial output rose 9.2 percent in July from a year
earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said today. The
growth compares with the 9.7 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 32 analysts and a 9.5 percent increase
in June. The consumer prices rose 1.8 percent from a year
earlier, the bureau said. That compares with the 1.7 percent
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 33 economists and
a 2.2 percent gain in June.  “The good news is that low inflation rates provides room
for further growth-supportive measures,”  Li Ye , an analyst at
Shenyin & Wanguo Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai.  Copper for delivery in November gained 0.8 percent to close
at 55,160  yuan  ($8,685) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  On the LME, lead advanced, while aluminum, zinc, and nickel
declined.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
