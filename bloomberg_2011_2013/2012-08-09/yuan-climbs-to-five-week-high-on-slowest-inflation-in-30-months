China’s  yuan  climbed to a five-week
high as government data showing the slowest inflation since
January 2010 fueled speculation policy makers will step up
stimulus to counter an economic slowdown.  Consumer prices  climbed 1.8 percent from a year earlier in
July, the nation’s statistics bureau said today. That followed a
2.2 percent increase in June. Decelerating increases in living
costs may allow for further loosening of monetary policy, the
China Securities Journal reported today, citing Li Kai, deputy
director at the State Information Center.  “Growth is the government’s priority and easing inflation
definitely allows policy makers to be more aggressive,” said
Banny Lam, chief economist at CCB International Securities in
 Hong Kong . The currency should stop weakening for now as
“investors are still looking for more signals to confirm the
effectiveness of  China ’s stimulus measures,” he said.  The yuan gained 0.04 percent to close at 6.3590 per dollar
in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. It touched 6.3502 today, the strongest level since July
5. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, increased 23 basis points, or 0.23
percentage point, to 1.4 percent.  The People’s Bank of China set the yuan’s  reference rate 
0.01 percent weaker at 6.3387 per dollar today. The currency is
allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
central bank’s daily fixing.  Exports Growth  Producer prices  fell 2.9 percent from a year earlier in
July following a 2.1 percent decline the previous month,
official data showed today.  Overseas sales  probably increased 8
percent last month from a year earlier, compared with an 11.3
percent increase in June, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey before trade figures are released tomorrow.  China will probably cut banks’ reserve-requirement ratios
this month and reduce benchmark  interest rates  in September as
“the concerns over inflation are gone,” Lam said.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan advanced 0.12
percent to 6.3630 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.08
percent to 6.4230, a 1 percent discount to the spot rate in
Shanghai, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
