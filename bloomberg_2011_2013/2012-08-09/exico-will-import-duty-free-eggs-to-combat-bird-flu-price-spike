Mexico  will free up some egg imports
from duties to help combat price increases caused by a bird flu
outbreak in the western state of Jalisco, according to a
presidential decree published today in the nation’s official
gazette.  Egg prices reached “speculative levels in the past few
days and are considerably hurting consumers and companies that
use the product,” according to the statement.  Mexico’s annual inflation rate breached the upper limit of
the central bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target range in June
and reached an 18-month high of 4.45 percent in mid-July. Egg
prices jumped 15.8 percent in the first half of July, according
to Mexico’s statistics agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
