James River Coal Co. (JRCC) , a producer of
the fuel in Appalachia and the Midwest, rose the most in more
than a month after reporting a smaller second-quarter loss than
analysts predicted as costs fell.  The shares  rose  12 percent to $2.49 at 11:30 a.m. in  New
York  after jumping as much as 20 percent, the most since July 5.  James River reported a loss of $25.8 million, or 74 cents a
share, less than the 78-cent average of 11 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 21 percent to $277.4 million
from $352 million a year earlier, the Richmond, Virginia-based
company said in a statement today.  The company’s cost of coal sold fell 4.8 percent to $77.08
a ton in the second quarter from $80.99 a year earlier, it said
in the statement.  James River  also benefited from selling metallurgical coal,
a premium coal grade used by steelmakers, at a higher price than
some other coal companies, said Lucas Pipes, an analyst at Brean
Murray Carret & Co. in New York.  “James River sold their met coal for $129/short ton, above
some of its peers that recently reported,” Pipes wrote in a
note today.  Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR)  reported an average realized
price for metallurgical coal of $127.83 a short ton, the company
said in its earnings release yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
