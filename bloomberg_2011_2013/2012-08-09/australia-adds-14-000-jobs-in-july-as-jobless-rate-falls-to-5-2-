Australian employers boosted payrolls
in July and the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly fell as the
nation’s resource-driven economy weathers a global slowdown,
sending the local dollar near a 4 1/2-month high.  The number of people employed rose by 14,000 last month,
the fourth gain in five months, erasing almost of half of the
revised 28,300 fall in June, the statistics bureau said in
Sydney today. That compares with the median estimate for a
10,000 increase in July employment in a Bloomberg News survey of
25 economists. The  jobless rate  fell to 5.2 percent from an
upwardly revised 5.3 percent.  The Australian dollar gained and bets on an interest-rate
cut declined as the data underscored the resilience of the
world’s 13th-largest economy, where unemployment is less than
half the 11.2 percent level in the euro area.  Reserve Bank  of
 Australia  Governor  Glenn Stevens  lowered borrowing costs by a
total of 75 basis points in May and June to shore up the economy
as growth in  Europe  and  China  weakens, before keeping them
unchanged at 3.5 percent at the past two meetings.  “The labor market is healthy without shooting the lights
out,” said  Savanth Sebastian , an economist in Sydney at
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia. (CBA)  “The jobs data will provide
another degree of comfort for the Reserve Bank. An array of
indicators has suggested that activity levels have bottomed out
and showing modest signs of improving.”  Currency’s Strength  The Australian dollar touched $1.0602 after the data, near
the $1.0604 reached on Aug. 7, which was the highest since March
20. The so-called Aussie, the world’s fifth-most traded
currency, climbed 2.6 percent in July after increasing 5.2
percent in June. It traded at $1.0592 at 12:42 p.m. in Sydney.  Traders are pricing in a 37 percent chance of a quarter-
point rate cut at the RBA’s next meeting on Sept. 4, down from
42 percent before today’s data, according to Bloomberg data
based on swaps trading.  The number of  full-time jobs  advanced by 9,200 in July, and
part-time employment rose 4,800, today’s report showed.
Australia’s participation rate, a measure of the  labor force  in
proportion to the population, dropped to 65.2 percent in July
from a revised 65.3 percent a month earlier, it showed.  State Breakdown  The report showed 3,300 jobs created in the nation’s most
populous state, New South Wales, helped counter a 3,800 decline
in Victoria, a center of the nation’s manufacturing industry. In
 Western Australia , where much of Australia’s  iron ore  mines are
based, employment fell by 4,200. In Queensland, the biggest
coal-producing state, jobs gained by 6,200, the data showed.  Australia’s unemployment rate has remained in a range of 5
percent to 5.3 percent for the past 15 months.  Stevens, after his Aug. 7 decision to hold rates, said
“most indicators suggest growth close to trend overall. Labor
market data show moderate employment growth, even with job
shedding in some industries, and the rate of unemployment has
thus far remained low.”  The RBA releases its updated growth and inflation forecasts
in a quarterly monetary policy statement tomorrow.  In  New Zealand  today, a government report showed the
unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.8 percent in the second
quarter from 6.7 percent in January-March period. Employment
fell by 0.1 percent, or 2,000 jobs, it showed. The median
estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists were for a jobless
rate of 6.5 percent and job growth of 0.4 percent.  Fiscal Stimulus  Recent Australian data has shown stronger  consumer
spending , fueled by A$2 billion ($2.1 billion) in government
carbon rebates and benefit checks paid out since May, as well as
the RBA rate cuts. Retail sales in June matched the biggest
advance since April 2011.  Powering growth is Australia’s biggest resource boom since
a gold rush in the 1850s. The latest bonanza -- for iron ore,
coal and natural gas -- is bringing investment projects the
government estimates to be worth A$500 billion.  Rio Tinto Group said in April that it has begun a four-
month recruitment drive to hire 6,000 workers for A$22 billion
of projects in Western Australia, the  Northern Territory ,
Queensland and New South Wales.  The resources boom has underpinned Australia’s currency,
and the local dollar’s surge has hurt manufacturing and tourism.  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s Australian division will cut production
about 29 percent and slash one in seven jobs after sales of its
flagship Falcon car and trucks slumped.  The automaker will reduce output in Australia to 148
vehicles a day from 209, and offer as many as 440 severance
payouts, the Dearborn, Michigan-based company said in an e-
mailed statement on July 17. Ford will fire workers should
acceptance of severance offers fall short of the goal, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
