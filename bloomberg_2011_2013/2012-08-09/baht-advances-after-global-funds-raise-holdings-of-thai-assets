Thailand ’s baht strengthened and
 government bonds  rose for a third day after foreign funds
boosted holdings of the nation’s assets.  Overseas investors bought $115 million more Thai equities
than they sold in the first three days of this week and pumped a
net $665 million into government debt, according to data from
the stock exchange and the Thai Bond Market Association.
Monetary stimulus should be retained as an option until there is
greater clarity on the impact of the global economy on Thailand,
the central bank said in the minutes of its July 25 policy
meeting released yesterday.  “Fund inflows are supporting the currency,” said  Yuji Kameoka , chief currency strategist at Daiwa Securities Co. in
Tokyo. “Although sentiment has been improving lately, it’s not
strong enough to push the baht and other regional currencies
toward new highs.”  The baht strengthened 0.1 percent to 31.49 per dollar as of
3:26 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency touched 31.27 on Aug. 6, the strongest level since
May 22. Its thee-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was little changed
at 6.24 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 dropped
one basis point to 3.10 percent, the lowest level since
February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
