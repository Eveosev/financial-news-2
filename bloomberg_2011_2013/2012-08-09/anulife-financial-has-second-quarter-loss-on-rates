Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  Canada ’s
largest insurer, posted its third quarterly loss in the last
year and said the worsening economy may make it harder to reach
its profitability target. Results topped analyst estimates.  The loss was C$300 million ($302 million), or 18 cents a
share, in the three months through June, compared with a C$490
million, or 26-cent, profit in the year-earlier period, the
insurer said in a statement today. The Toronto-based company
said its 2015 goal may be “more of a stretch” because of
“macro-economic headwinds.”  Manulife has said it expects to reach profit of C$4 billion
and return on equity of 13 percent by 2015. The insurer said it
absorbed a C$677 million charge for long-term interest rate
assumptions in the quarter, while declining stock prices also
contributed to the loss.  “While this is the first time that it has truly conceded
the possibility of defeat, given the ongoing challenging market
environment, we do not believe that it will come as a surprise
to the street”  John Aiken , an analyst at Barclays Plc in
Toronto, wrote in a note to clients today.  Aiken said the company earned about 30 cents a share before
one-time items, above his estimate of 28 cents a share.  The owner of Boston-based John Hancock Financial is the
last of Canada’s three main life insurers to report results.
Yesterday,  Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF)  said second-quarter profit
plunged 88 percent to C$51 million.  Great-West Lifeco Inc. (GWO) 
reported last week that profit fell 6.7 percent to C$491
million.  Manulife fell 2 percent to C$10.83 in trading on the
Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday. The shares have declined less
than 1 percent this year.  (Manulife will hold a conference call at 2 p.m. Toronto
time to discuss results. To listen, dial +1-416-340-2216 or +1-
