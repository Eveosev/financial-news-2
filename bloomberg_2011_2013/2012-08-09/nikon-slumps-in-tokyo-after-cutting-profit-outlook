Nikon Corp. (7731)  dropped the most in 17
months in  Tokyo  trading after lowering its forecast for annual
profit, citing the outlook for weakening global economic growth
and a stronger yen.  The Japanese manufacturer of cameras and chipmaking
equipment plunged 9 percent, the biggest decline since March 15,
2011, to 2,063 yen as of 9:22 a.m. in Tokyo, after falling as
low as 2,001 yen.  “Uncertainties in the economy are increasing, while the
yen’s gain will likely add pressure,” on profit, the company
said in a statement yesterday in Tokyo, after the market closed.  Nikon and Japan-based camera makers including  Canon Inc. (7751) 
face weak demand for point-and-shoot cameras as smartphones with
built-in cameras lure buyers. The  International Monetary Fund 
last month lowered its estimate for 2012 global economic growth
to 3.5 percent, from its forecast in April for 3.6 percent,
saying “financial market and sovereign stress in the euro area
and periphery have ratcheted up.”  The Japanese currency has averaged 79.57 yen versus the
dollar this year, compared with the 79.71 yen average for 2011
and 103.40 yen in 2008. A stronger currency erodes the value of
overseas earnings and makes exporters’ products less competitive
overseas.  Net income  at Nikon will probably be 60 billion yen ($765
million) in the year ending March 31, compared with a forecast
made three months ago for 65 billion yen, the Tokyo-based
company said in yesterday’s statement. That compared with the 68
billion yen average of 18 analyst  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Operating Profit  Operating profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, will probably total 85 billion yen this
fiscal year, compared with the company’s previous projection of
90 billion yen, Nikon said.  Canon, Nikon’s larger rival in cameras, last month cut its
sales and profit forecasts citing weaker growth in the U.S.,
 Europe  and  China .  Worldwide  shipments  of cameras fell 1.2 percent to 136
billion yen in June from a year earlier, according to the Camera
& Imaging Products Association in Tokyo.  Sales of single-lens-reflex models with interchangeable
lenses gained about 24 percent, while compact-camera sales
dropped 30 percent during the month, according to the industry
group.  Nikon introduced its first mirrorless model in October,
joining Sony Corp. and  Panasonic Corp. (6752)  to feature cameras that
have interchangeable lenses without the bulk necessary in types
that use mirrors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
