Canadian oils jumped for the fifth
consecutive session before planned maintenance the next few
months that will reduce supply flows from  Alberta  upgraders and
production sites.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. will make repairs at its
Horizon  upgrader  in Alberta during the third quarter on heat
exchangers and mechanical seals, President  Steve Laut  said
during a conference call with investors.  MEG Energy Corp. will halt bitumen output at its Christina
Lake processing plant for about three weeks of work in
September, Brad Bellows, a Calgary-based spokesman for the
company, said yesterday in a phone interview.  Syncrude gained 50 cents to $4.50 a barrel over West Texas
Intermediate at 12:28 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the largest premium for the grade
since Dec. 2. Syncrude is a synthetic oil upgraded from tar-like
bitumen in Alberta into refinery-ready crude.  Western Canada Select’s discount narrowed $2.70 to $12.30 a
barrel below WTI, the smallest gap since Dec. 5. Bakken oil’s
discount narrowed $1 to $2.25 a barrel below the U.S. benchmark.  In the U.S. Gulf Coast, most grades weakened. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet’s premium to the U.S. benchmark narrowed $1.25
to $16 a barrel. Light Louisiana Sweet decreased 35 cents to $17
over WTI.  Poseidon’s premium slipped 55 cents to $11.75, while
Southern Green Canyon decreased 60 cents to $10.65 a barrel over
WTI. Mars Blend’s premium lost 90 cents to $12.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
narrowed $2.05 to $14.85.  To contact the reporter on this story:
