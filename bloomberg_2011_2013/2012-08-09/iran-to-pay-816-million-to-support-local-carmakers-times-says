Iran ’s ministry of industries, mines
and commerce will pay 10 trillion rials ($816 million) to
Iranian carmakers as they are going through “financial
problems,”  Tehran Times  reported.  Iran’s two biggest automakers, Iran Khodro Co. and SAIPA,
are struggling to pay debts to domestic part makers, Industries,
Mines and Commerce Minister Mehdi Ghazanfari said according to
the newspaper.  Car production decreased by 37.4 percent in the first four
months of the current Iranian year that started on March 20,
compared to the same period last year, the report said. Some 1.6
million cars were manufactured in Iran last year and about
55,000 cars exported, Ghazanfari told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
