B/E Aerospace Inc. (BEAV) , a maker of cabin
interiors for commercial aircraft and business jets, got a $950
million five-year revolving credit line to replace a $750
million debt pact that was set to expire in 2015.  The new senior secured credit, which matures in August
2017, pays interest at 1.75 percentage points more than the
London interbank offered rate, according to a regulatory filing
yesterday. The  interest rate  on the revolver would have been
about 2.21 percent had it been drawn on June 30, the company
said in the filing.  B/E Aerospace, based in Wellington, Florida, had $1.75
billion of long-term  debt  consisting entirely of bonds at the
end of June, according to the filing.  Moody’s Investors Service said today it gave the revolver
an investment-grade rating of Baa2, while affirming B/E
Areospace’s junk-category corporate ranking of Ba1.  Standard &
Poor’s , which rates the company BB+, assigned the revolver a BBB
grade.  The new revolving credit has a so-called accordion feature
allowing the company to request as much as $750 million of
additional commitments or term loans, according to Moody’s.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
