JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
U.S. bank, said it had a “material weakness” in its financial
reporting during the first quarter that has since been
corrected.  JPMorgan restated first-quarter results after discovering
that traders in London “may have been seeking to avoid showing
the full amount of the losses” in a synthetic credit book
during the first quarter, the New York-based company said in a
regulatory filing today.  Internal reporting controls were “substantially
remediated” by June 30, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
