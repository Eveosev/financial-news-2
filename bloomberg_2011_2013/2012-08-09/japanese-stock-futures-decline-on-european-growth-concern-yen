Japanese stock futures fell after
economists in a European Central Bank survey cut a regional
growth forecast, sending the euro lower against the yen and
damping the earnings outlook for Asia’s exporters.  American depository receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker
that depends on Europe for almost a third of its sales, fell 0.6
percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of Sony
Corp gained 2.1 percent after Japan’s biggest exporter of
consumer electronics offered to buy the remaining shares of
online shopping site So-net Entertainment Corp. ADRs of Telstra
Corp. lost 0.9 percent after Credit Suisse Group AG cut its
rating on Australia’s biggest phone company.  Futures on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 8,955 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
8,970 in Osaka. They were bid in pre-market trading at 8,960 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
futures rose 0.1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index added
0.1 percent in Wellington.  “The euro’s weakness is likely to get priced into stocks
today,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and strategist at
Tachibana Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Investors won’t become
bullish until the  currency market  settles down.”  The euro slid versus most major peers after economists in a
European Central Bank survey cut their 2013 growth forecast to
0.6 percent from 1 percent. The 17-nation currency fell to as
low as 96.33 yen last night in Tokyo, compared with 97.11 at the
close of  stock trading  yesterday. A weaker euro cuts the value
of some income for Japan’s exporters.  Jobless Claims  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  slid 0.1 percent
today. The gauge rose less than 0.1 percent yesterday after
jobless claims unexpectedly dropped by 6,000 to 361,000 in the
week ended Aug. 4. The median forecast of 43 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News called for an increase to 370,000.  The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese
equities in the U.S rose 0.7 percent to 91.49 in New York
yesterday, led by Semiconductor Manufacturing International
Corp. and Sina Corp., a social media company.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  fell 6.2 percent from this
year’s high on Feb. 29 through yesterday amid concern Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis will worsen and  China’s economy  is
slowing. The regional benchmark index traded at 12.4 times
estimated earnings, compared with 13.6 for the S&P 500 Index and
11.6 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Of the 1,008 companies listed on the Asian benchmark gauge,
161 firms are scheduled to post earnings this week, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Of the 371 companies to have
reported since July 1 that have issued forecasts, fewer than
half have beaten expectations, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
