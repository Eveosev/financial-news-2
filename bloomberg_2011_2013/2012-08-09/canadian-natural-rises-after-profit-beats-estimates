Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the
nation’s third-largest oil company by market value, rose to the
highest in more than two months after second-quarter earnings
beat analysts’ expectations.  Canadian Natural  gained  4.8 percent to C$30.99 at 1:13 p.m.
in Toronto, the highest intraday price since May 30. The company
had the third-biggest increase among the 64 members of the
Standard & Poor’s/Toronto Stock Exchange Energy Index.  Excluding one-time items, second-quarter earnings were 55
cents, beating the 53-cent average of 15  analysts’ estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Net income  dropped to C$753 million ($758
million), or 68 cents a share, from C$929 million, or 84 cents,
a year earlier, the Calgary-based company said in a statement
today.  Lower-than-expected royalties and cash taxes contributed to
the beat, Phil Skolnick, a New York-based research analyst with
Canaccord Genuity Corp., said in a note to clients today.  Sales rose 12 percent to C$4.19 billion from C$3.73 billion
a year earlier. Canadian Natural produced a record amount of oil
and natural gas during the quarter, boosting output 22 percent
to the equivalent of 679,607 barrels a day. Lower prices for the
fuels contributed to the drop in income for the quarter, the
company said.  “Commodity prices continue to be volatile with a mixed
outlook,” Vice Chairman John Langille said on a conference call
with analysts today. The company is “bullish” on heavy oil
while it sees continued low prices in gas markets, President
 Steve Laut  said on the call.  Cutting Spending  In response, Canadian Natural is cutting its 2012 capital
spending plan by C$680 million, or 5 percent, to C$4.8 billion.
Most of the spending reductions will be at its Horizon oil-sands
plant in  Alberta  and in North American gas operations, the
company said in the release.  Canadian Natural narrowed its forecast for oil and natural
gas liquids production this year to 454,000 to 474,000 barrels a
day from 440,000 to 480,000. It reduced its gas output estimate
to as much as 1.235 billion cubic feet of gas a day, from May 3
guidance of as much as 1.26 billion cubic feet.  The company cut its 2012 gas drilling program in half
during the second quarter, reducing the number of wells drilled
to 35 from 71. Canadian Natural has also shut in 20 million
cubic feet of gas a day this year, Laut said.  The stock, which has declined 19 percent this year, has 20
buy and five hold  ratings  from analysts.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  and  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO)  are the largest
Canadian crude companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
