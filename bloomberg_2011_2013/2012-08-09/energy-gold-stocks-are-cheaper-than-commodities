Asian dealmaking in  North America 
confirms energy and gold stocks are a bargain when compared with
the underlying commodities, according to Frank Holmes, U.S.
Global Investors Inc.’s chief executive officer.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, the shares have trailed
commodity prices for more than a year. The top panel tracks a
Standard & Poor’s 500 index of 17 oil and natural-gas producers
and Brent crude, an industry benchmark. The bottom panel has the
NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, consisting of 30 stocks, along with
the price of gold for immediate delivery.  “The disparities mean that the cheapest resources are not
found in the ground -- they’re listed” on stock exchanges,
Holmes wrote three days ago in a blog  posting .  Proposed multibillion-dollar takeovers of Canadian energy
producers by  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  and Petroliam Nasional Bhd show the
value available in commodity stocks, according to Holmes.  Cnooc, China’s largest offshore-oil explorer, offered to
acquire  Nexen Inc. (NXY)  in July for 61 percent more than the stock’s
market price. The proposed deal followed an offer in June from
Petronas, Malaysia’s state-owned energy company, for  Progress
Energy Resources Corp. (PRQ)  that was 77 percent above the market
price. The bid was raised last month.  Holmes’s firm, based in San Antonio, runs three commodity-
related mutual funds with total assets of about $1 billion. The
biggest is the Global Resources Fund, which returned 12 percent
during the two-year period depicted in the chart, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
