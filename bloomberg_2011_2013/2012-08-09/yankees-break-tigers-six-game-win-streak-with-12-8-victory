The New York Yankees scored seven
runs off starting pitcher Anibal Sanchez in a 12-8 win that
ended the Detroit Tigers’ six-game winning streak in Major
League Baseball.  Sanchez dropped to 1-2 after giving up the runs, all earned,
in three innings at Comerica Park in Detroit last night. Four
Detroit relief pitchers surrendered another five runs.  “We just didn’t pitch very well,” Tigers manager  Jim Leyland  told reporters.  Curtis Granderson  hit his 30th home run of the season and
drove in four runs to tie his season high, while Mark Teixeira’s
sacrifice fly in the fourth scored  Derek Jeter  to give the
Yankees a 7-0 lead.  The Tigers closed to 8-7 in the seventh inning before the
Yankees pulled away to log their seventh win in 19 games.  C.C. Sabathia improved to 12-3 after giving up five runs on
eight hits while striking out seven batters in 6 2/3 innings.  The Yankees (64-46) lead the five-team American League East
by 4 1/2 games over the Baltimore Orioles (60-51), who defeated
the Seattle Mariners 9-2 last night.  The Tigers (60-51) are a half game behind the AL Central-
leading  Chicago White Sox .  To contact the reporter on this story:
