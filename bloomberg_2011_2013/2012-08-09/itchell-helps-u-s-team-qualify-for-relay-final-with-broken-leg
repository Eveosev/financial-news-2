Manteo Mitchell helped the U.S.
qualify for the men’s 1,600-meter relay final while running with
a broken leg, according to a  statement from USA Track and Field.   The 25-year-old ran the first leg of the relay today in a
time of 46.1 seconds, fifth fastest in the field, even though he
heard his bone crack after running about 200 meters.  “I felt it break,” Mitchell said in the statement. “I
heard it. I even put out a little war cry but the crowd was so
loud you couldn’t hear it. I wanted to just lie down. It felt
like somebody literally just snapped my leg in half.”  His run helped the U.S. qualify with a time of 2 minutes,
58.87 seconds that tied for a season’s best. The U.S. squad
finished second in its heat to the Bahamas, which had the same
time. After the race, team doctor Bob Adams confirmed that
Mitchell had broken his left fibula.  The final is set for tomorrow night. USA Track and Field
said the lineup for the American team in the final will be
announced tomorrow morning.  Mitchell originally hurt himself three days earlier by
missing a step as he walked up a flight of stairs at the Olympic
Village, according to the USA Track and Field statement.  “Manteo has become an inspiration and a hero for his
teammates,” Max Siegel, the chief executive officer of USA
Track and Field, said in the statement. “Without his courage
and determination to finish, Team USA would not be at the
starting line in the final.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
