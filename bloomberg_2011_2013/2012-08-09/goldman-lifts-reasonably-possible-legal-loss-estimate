Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, raised its estimate for potential
losses from legal claims by 26 percent.  “Reasonably possible”  legal costs  are as much as $3.4
billion, the New York-based firm said today in a report on the
quarter that ended June 30, without giving specific reasons for
the jump. That compares with $2.7 billion three months earlier.
The estimate is the highest since the firm’s $3.4 billion
forecast for Dec. 31, 2010, which was the first time the firm
supplied a figure for potential legal expenses.  Banks started releasing estimates of possible losses after
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told finance chiefs
in October 2010 that they should disclose such costs “when
there is at least a reasonable possibility” they may be
incurred, even if the risk is too low to require reserves.  The estimate doesn’t include potential losses from legal
matters that are at an early stage or where the firm can’t
determine the potential amount, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
