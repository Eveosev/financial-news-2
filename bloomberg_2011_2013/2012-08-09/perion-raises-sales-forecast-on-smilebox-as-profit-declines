Perion Network Ltd. (PERI) , which posted a
drop in second-quarter profit, raised its annual sales forecast
as the digital media company expects growth at the photo-sharing
unit it acquired last year.  Tel Aviv-based Perion revised its 2012 sales outlook to
between $50 million and $52 million from as much as $50 million,
according to a statement filed with the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange
yesterday. Chief Executive Officer Josef Mandelbaum attributed
the revision to contributions from Smilebox Inc., which it
acquired in August 2011.  “We’re expecting more from Smilebox which continues to be
profitable,” Mandelbaum said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television today.  Shares of Perion fell 2.4 percent, set for the biggest drop
since June 19, to 20.30 shekels at 3:18 p.m. in  Tel Aviv . Net
income based on U.S. accounting standards fell 60 percent to
$878,000, the company said.  Perion trades at 5.8 times estimated earnings, compared
with 11 times for the benchmark TA-25 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The measure fell 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
