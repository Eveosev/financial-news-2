Co-operative Bank of Kenya Ltd. , the
country’s fifth-biggest lender by market value, declined to its
lowest level in a month after lending in the second quarter fell
and interest paid on deposits more than doubled.  Shares in Co-op Bank, as the lender is known, declined as
much as 2.2 percent to 10.90 shillings before trading 0.9
percent lower at 11.05 shillings by 12:10 p.m. in the capital,
Nairobi. A close at this level would be the lowest since June 5.  “Quarter-on-quarter, their lending is down marginally,”
Faith Atiti, an analyst at Nairobi-based Sterling Investment
Bank, said in a phone interview today.  In the three months to June, the bank provided 112.6
billion shillings ($1.34 billion) to customers compared with
113.6 billion shillings in the previous three months, according
to an e-mailed statement from the company.  Interest paid on deposits more than doubled to 5.55 billion
shillings from the previous quarter,  “We therefore see a risk to the bank’s balance sheet
growth prospects in financial year 2012 as the bank seeks to
protect itself from interest expenses arising from expensive
wholesale deposits,” Gregory Waweru, an analyst at Nairobi-
based Kestrel Capital ( East Africa ) Ltd., said in an e-mailed
note today.  Co-op Bank today said first-half profit climbed 22 percent
to 4.03 billion shillings as earnings from loans grew in the six
months through June. Net interest income, the money banks earn
from charges on loans, jumped 25 percent to 7.44 billion
shillings, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
