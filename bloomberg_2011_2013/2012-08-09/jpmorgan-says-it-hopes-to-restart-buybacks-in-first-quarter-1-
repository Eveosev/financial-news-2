JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
U.S. bank by assets, said it hopes to resume repurchases of its
stock in the first quarter, moving back a target set last month
by Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon .  Dimon, 56, had told analysts July 13 that the New York-
based lender may restart buybacks in this year’s fourth quarter,
“if all goes well.” Today, the bank said it “hopes to recommence 
its equity repurchase program in the first quarter of 2013.”  Doing so depends on the board’s completion of work on the
chief investment office, which lost $5.8 billion on wrong-way
bets in this year’s first half, and on the Federal Reserve’s
view of the bank’s resubmitted capital plan, JPMorgan said today
in a regulatory filing.  The company’s shares fell 1.6 percent to $36.55 in early
trading in New York. The stock has advanced 12 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
