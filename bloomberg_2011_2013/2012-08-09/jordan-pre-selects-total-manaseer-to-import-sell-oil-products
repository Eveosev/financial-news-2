Jordan pre-selected technical offers
from  Total SA (FP)  and Amman-based Al Manaseer Co. for rights to
import and distribute refined oil products, Al Ghad  reported .  The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources is studying
financial details of the offers submitted by the companies, the
newspaper reported today, citing a government official it didnâ€™t
identify. Jordan Petroleum Refinery Co. currently holds a
domestic monopoly on the import and sale of oil products, and
the ministry hopes to make the business more competitive by
inviting additional suppliers, Al Ghad said.  Total and Al Manaseer, if the ministry approves their
offers, will both have the right to own and operate gasoline
stations, import oil products and sell the products to other
filling stations and retail customers, according to the
newspaper with headquarters in Amman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
