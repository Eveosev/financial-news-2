Indian Oil Corp. (IOCL)  posted the nation’s
biggest quarterly loss of 224.5 billion rupees ($4.1 billion)
after the government failed to compensate it for capping fuel
prices and processing margins turned negative.  The country’s largest company had reported an earnings
deficit of 37.2 billion rupees a year earlier, the New Delhi-
based state-owned refiner said in a stock exchange filing today.
The median  estimate  of 21 analysts compiled by Bloomberg was a
loss of 64.3 billion rupees. Hindustan Petroleum Corp. posted a
record loss of 92.5 billion rupees.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government, struggling to
contain a  budget deficit  and inflation, failed to compensate
state-run refiners for selling some fuels below cost to curb
price gains. The rupee’s slump increased the cost of purchases
for the refiner, which imports almost 80 percent of its oil
requirements, while Brent crude’s 20 percent decline in the
quarter lowered the value of its stockpiles.  “The $4 billion loss is stunning and staggering,” said
 Jagannadham Thunuguntla , chief strategist at SMC  Global
Securities Ltd. (GLBS)  in  New Delhi . “The oil marketing policy is so
complicated that these companies have to live at the mercy of
cash compensation policy of the government.”  Indian Oil fell 1.8 percent to 251.60 rupees at the close
in Mumbai, the lowest level since June 19. The stock has
declined 0.9 percent this year, compared with a 14 percent
increase in the benchmark Sensitive Index.  Increasing Debt  Indian Oil didn’t get compensated for a loss of 174.9
billion rupees on fuel sales below-cost, Chairman R.S. Butola
told reporters in New Delhi. The  company  received 82 billion
rupees as a government grant a year earlier.  The delay in getting compensation increased the refiner’s
interest payments, Butola said.  Indian Oil had debt of 909 billion rupees as of June 30,
compared with 754.5 billion rupees on March 31, Butola said.  The refiner lost $4.81 on every barrel of crude processed
into fuels in the quarter, compared with earnings of $4.71 a
barrel a year earlier, according to the statement. The drop in
the refining margin was on account of an inventory valuation
loss of 40.6 billion rupees, or $7.54 a barrel, according to the
earnings release.  The company got a discount of 80.4 billion rupees on crude
bought from state-run explorers, including  Oil & Natural Gas
Corp. (ONGC) , compared with 79.3 billion rupees a year earlier.  The rupee declined 8.6 percent against the  U.S. dollar  in
the quarter, the worst performer among major currencies in Asia
Pacific.  Brent crude oil in  London  had its biggest quarterly drop in
3 1/2 years in the three months ended June 30, declining 20
percent to $97.80 from March 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
