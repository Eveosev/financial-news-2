Mexico’s peso rose the first time
this week after Fitch Ratings affirmed Germany’s top credit
rating, easing concern that the impact of Europe’s debt crisis
may be growing more acute in the region’s biggest economy.  The currency climbed 0.6 percent to 13.1452 per  U.S. dollar 
at 4 p.m. in Mexico City. Today’s advance boosted the peso’s
gain this year to 6 percent, the most among the dollar’s 16 most
traded counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  The peso reversed earlier declines after Fitch’s
affirmation of Germany’s AAA rating “helped stabilize  market
sentiment  and pushed the peso back toward an appreciating
trend,”  Eduardo Suarez , a Latin America currency strategist at
Scotiabank, said in an e-mailed message.  Speculation that Europe’s debt crisis would hurt Mexican
exports helped make the peso Latin America’s worst-performing
major currency in 2011.  The yield on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.48 percent, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.13 centavo to
140.49 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
