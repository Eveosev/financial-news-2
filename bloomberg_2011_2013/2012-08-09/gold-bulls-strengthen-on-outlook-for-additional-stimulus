Gold traders are the most bullish in
five weeks as investors expanded their bullion holdings near a
record on mounting speculation that central banks will have to
do more to bolster economic growth.  Fifteen of 30 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg said they
expect prices to rise next week and eight were bearish. A
further seven were neutral, making the proportion of bulls the
highest since July 6. Investors bought about $850 million of
gold through  exchange-traded products  this month, taking the
total of 2,411.7 metric tons yesterday to within 0.1 percent of
the all-time high set July 5, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  China ’s industrial-production growth weakened in July and
U.S. and European manufacturing contracted. The  Federal Reserve 
pledged to do more if needed on Aug. 1 and the  European Central
Bank  promised last month to do “whatever it takes” to preserve
the euro. Lower  interest rates  increase the allure of gold,
which generally earns investors returns only through price
gains. Bullion rose 70 percent as the Fed bought $2.3 trillion
of debt in two rounds of quantitative easing through June 2011.  “More stimulus or money printing is almost certain given
the levels of debt out there which is slowing down economic
growth,” said Mark O’Byrne, the executive director of Dublin-
based GoldCore Ltd., a brokerage that sells and stores
everything from quarter-ounce British Sovereigns to 400-ounce
bars. “That should be supportive of  gold prices .”  Gold’s Rally  Gold rose 3.6 percent to $1,623.60 an ounce on the Comex in
 New York  this year, extending 11 consecutive annual gains. That
compares with a 1.8 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
gauge of 24 commodities and a 7.6 percent advance in the MSCI
All-Country World Index of equities. Treasuries returned 1.9
percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  The 16.3 tons purchased through ETPs this month increased
the value of total holdings to about $125.4 billion. Investors
bought 55 tons since the start of January. Buying should reach
250 tons this year and 150 tons in 2013, Barclays Plc predicts.  U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly contracted in July for a
second month, the  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory
index showed Aug. 1. The Fed has held interest rates at a record
low since 2008. Boston Fed President  Eric Rosengren  said in an
Aug. 7 interview with CNBC that the central bank should pursue
an “open-ended” easing program of “substantial magnitude.”  Growth Forecast  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its 2013 global growth
forecast to 3.9 percent on July 16, from an April projection of
4.1 percent, citing  Europe ’s debt crisis. The euro-area’s
economy will contract 0.3 percent this year, from a previous
estimate of 0.2 percent, according to an ECB economist survey
published in the central bank’s monthly bulletin yesterday.  Some investors have favored the dollar and government bonds
as a store of value instead of gold. The U.S. Dollar Index, a
measure against six major trading partners, reached a two-year
high July 24. The 30-week correlation coefficient between the
dollar and bullion is at -0.61, from -0.24 in September, with a
figure of -1 meaning the two move inversely.  Germany , the U.K.
and  France  sold debt at the lowest yields ever in July.  Hedge funds  cut bets on higher prices by 51 percent in the
past five months, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission  data 
show. While the net-long position rose 35 percent in the week
ended July 31, it is still near the lowest since 2008. Volumes
traded on the Comex slipped to a 17-month low in July, bourse
data show. Open interest, or contracts outstanding, tumbled 26
percent since September, when gold reached a record $1,923.70.  Coin Demand  Demand for gold coins is weakening, with sales of American
Eagles by the  U.S. Mint  dropping 49 percent to 30,500 ounces
last month, the lowest since April. The mint sold 4,000 ounces
so far in August, data on its website show.  While gold is still trading 16 percent below the September
record, it has averaged about $1,643 this year. Should that be
sustained through the end of December, it would be the most
ever. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is predicting a price of $1,785
in three months.  In other commodities, 12 of 33 traders and analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg expect copper to rise next week and the
same amount predicted a drop. The metal for delivery in three
months, the London Metal Exchange’s benchmark contract, fell 1.6
percent to $7,480 a ton this year.  Seven of 13 people surveyed said raw sugar will climb next
week and six predicted declines. The commodity slipped 11
percent to 20.77 cents a pound since the start of January on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York.  Food Prices  World food prices surged the most since 2009 in July as
droughts damaged crops from the U.S. to  Russia , according to a
 United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization  index. (MXWD)  Drought
covers almost 63 percent of the contiguous U.S., which suffered
the hottest month on record in July, the  National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration  said Aug. 8.  Seventeen of 31 people surveyed anticipate higher corn
prices next week and eight were neutral, while 15 of 32 said
soybeans will increase and eight predicted little change. Corn
jumped 27 percent to $8.205 a bushel in  Chicago  this year and
reached a record $8.49 today. Soybeans set an all-time high July
23 and are up 36 percent this year at $16.4525 a bushel.  “More quantitative easing will be certainly beneficial to
commodities,” said Colin O’Shea, the head of commodities at
Hermes Investment Management Ltd. in  London , which manages about
$2 billion of raw-material assets. “Do you need more QE to
drive the market higher? Probably not. The demand side of the
equation has been pretty robust.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
