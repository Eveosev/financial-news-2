Huntsman Corp. (HUN) , the biggest maker of
textile dyes, said it commissioned studies into expanding a
Louisiana plant to satisfy rising demand for foam insulation and
to take advantage of cheaper natural-gas supplies.  The company is mulling “several” options for the
expansion of its Geismar plant to boost the output of methylene
diphenyl diisocyanate, the Salt Lake City-based company said
today in a statement. The chemical compound is used to produce
polyurethane foams.  “With the benefits of U.S. shale gas, the economics of
investing in our U.S. facilities has improved significantly,”
Anthony P. Hankins, president of Huntsman Polyurethanes, said in
the statement.  An increasing volume of gas extracted from shale rock has
pushed prices down this year to the lowest in a decade. Cheaper
gas is doubly advantageous for chemical makers because they use
it for energy and as a raw material. Huntsman Chief Executive
Officer Peter Huntsman said in May the company plans to increase
production of ethylene and other related chemicals in  Texas 
because of cheaper gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
