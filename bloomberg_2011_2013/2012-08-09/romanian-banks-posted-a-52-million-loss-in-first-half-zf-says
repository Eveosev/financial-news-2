Romanian banks incurred total losses
of 192 million lei ($52 million) in the first half of this year
because of higher bad-loans costs,  Ziarul Financiar  reported,
citing unpublished figures from the central bank.  Twenty-three of the 41 banks operating in the country
posted profits for the first six months, while 18 recorded
losses, according to the newspaper.  The central bank revised total 2011 losses for the banking
system to 777 million lei, up from 430 million, after the
results were audited, Ziarul Financiar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
