The  European Central Bank ’s bond
purchases will be “sufficient” to help bolster markets,
Governing Council member  Christian Noyer  said.  “The Governing Council has announced its intention to
intervene in the bond markets to ensure the proper transmission
of monetary policy,” Noyer told  Le Point  magazine in an
interview published today. The remarks were confirmed by his
office in Paris. “Our operations will be sufficient to have a
strong impact on the markets.”  The remarks underline French support for a plan outlined by
ECB President  Mario Draghi  one week ago for the central bank to
wade into bond markets in tandem with  Europe ’s rescue fund.
Draghi noted in his Aug. 2 press conference that Germany’s
Bundesbank has reservations about the proposal, details of which
still need to be hammered out.  “We need to be ready to intervene very quickly and
favoring bonds with shorter maturities,” said Noyer, who is
also governor of  France ’s central bank. “No one should have any
doubt about the Governing Council’s determination and capacity
to act within the framework of its mandate.”  Draghi said last week new purchases in the secondary market
would only complement buying by Europe’s rescue fund in the
primary market, to which strict conditionality is attached.  “This is about acting against excessive sovereign risk
premiums,” Noyer said. “Of course this would only make sense
if member states themselves decide to act” and make the
“necessary budget improvement.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
