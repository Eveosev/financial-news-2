U.K. police have arrested a 40-year-
old man on suspicion of the murder of oil company worker Carole
Waugh.  Rakesh Bhayani is being held in a south London police
station, the  Metropolitan Police Service  said in an e-mailed
statement.  Bhayani already faces three charges of conspiracy to commit
fraud by “false representation arising from transactions
associated” with Waugh’s identity up to a total of 280,000
pounds ($438,000), police said.  Waugh was reported missing by her family on May 7 and a
body identified as the 50-year-old woman was found inside a car
in a London garage on Aug. 7. The Metropolitan Police Service
said that Waugh was in between jobs at the time of her
disappearance and had worked in the oil and banking industries
as a financial manager and executive.  A second unidentified man was arrested on Aug. 1 on
suspicion of murder and is still being held by  London  police.  Nicholas Kutner, was charged with conspiracy to commit
fraud this week at a London magistrates court. He is accused of
posing as Waugh’s brother and attempting to sell her apartment
in London’s Marylebone district.  To contact the reporter on this story:
