Radian Group Inc. (RDN) , the mortgage
insurer, said it received a civil investigative demand from the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for information about
possible violations of laws that protect homebuyers from abuses.  The demand was received in June and focuses on whether home
lenders and mortgage insurers ran afoul of rules including the
Dodd Frank act and Consumer Financial Protection Act,
Philadelphia-based Radian said today in a regulatory filing.  “We are cooperating with the CFPB in its investigation,”
the company said today, reiterating a passage from an Aug. 1
statement that previously disclosed the probe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
