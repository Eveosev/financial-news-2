Oil was little changed as reports
signaled that the  U.S. economy  was strengthening and the dollar
surged against the euro, curbing investors’ appetite for
commodities.  Futures, which climbed in intraday trading after reports
that initial  jobless claims  dropped last week and the U.S. trade
deficit was less than expected, retreated as the dollar advanced
against the euro on concern  Europe ’s economy will deteriorate
further. A rising U.S. currency and weakening euro decrease the
appeal of raw materials as an investment.  “The dollar is stronger and that’s likely to keep a lid on
prices,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Crude has been as
high as $94.21 and it keeps coming back.”  Crude oil for September delivery rose 1 cent to settle at
$93.36 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures
traded between $93.07 and $94.21 today. Prices are up 20 percent
from $77.69 on June 28, the lowest close this year.  Brent oil for September settlement increased $1.08, or 1
percent, to $113.22 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark’s premium to West Texas
Intermediate crude, the grade traded in  New York , increased to
$19.86, the highest level in four months.  U.S. Economy  Jobless claims fell 6,000 to 361,000 last week, below the
370,000  median  forecast of 43 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
The  U.S. trade deficit  for June totaled $42.9 billion, less than
the $47.5 billion  median  forecast of 69 economists who replied
to a Bloomberg survey.  The better-than-projected trade reading may help boost
second-quarter growth figures when the government revises the
data this month. The U.S. economy grew at a 1.5 percent annual
pace in the April-through-June period, compared with a 2 percent
rate in the previous three months, the Commerce Department
reported July 27.  “The positive U.S. economic data is having an impact on
crude,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics
LLC, an Austin, Texas-based energy consultant. “These are
positive growth signals. The trade number is a sign that second-
quarter GDP will be revised higher.”  Oil pared the gain as the dollar climbed as much as 0.8
percent against the euro after economists in a European Central
Bank survey cut their 2013 growth forecast to 0.6 percent from 1
percent. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  and the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  were also little changed today.  Home Prices  In another sign of economic improvement, prices for single-
family homes climbed in most U.S. cities in the second quarter
and values nationally jumped the most since 2006. The median
sales  price  increased from a year earlier in 110 of 147
metropolitan areas measured, the National Association of
Realtors said. In the first quarter, 74 areas had gains.  Slower consumer-price inflation in  China  may encourage
policy makers to add measures to reverse the economic slowdown
and boost demand.  Consumer prices  rose 1.8 percent from a year
earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in Beijing. That
compared with the 1.7 percent  median forecast  of 33 economists
in a Bloomberg survey and a 2.2 percent gain in June.  The leaders of China’s ruling Communist Party pledged last
week to keep adjusting policies to ensure the economy expands at
a stable rate this year. China was the second-biggest crude-
consuming country, accounting for 11 percent of global demand in
2011, compared with 21 percent for the U.S., according to  BP
Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy released in June.  ‘Green Light’  “The market is in a mode where all that matters is the
prospect of central bank monetary stimulus,” said Guy Wolf, a
strategist at Marex Spectron Group Ltd., a London-based
commodities brokerage. “So soft growth data, without
inflationary pressure, is a green light for central banks.
Further stimulus in China is almost a certainty.”  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said in
its Monthly Oil Market Report that it will need to supply 29.5
million barrels of crude a day next year. That’s down 100,000 a
day from what the 12-member group’s Vienna-based secretariat
projected last month.  Iraq’s crude output rose above 3 million barrels a day last
month for the first time since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that
toppled  Saddam Hussein , OPEC said. Iraq pumped 3.08 million
barrels a day in July, 115,000 barrels more than the previous
month, the report showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 432,914
contracts as of 2:42 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 615,755
contracts yesterday, 11 percent above the three-month average.
Open interest was 1.45 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
