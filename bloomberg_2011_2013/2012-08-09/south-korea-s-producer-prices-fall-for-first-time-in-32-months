South Korean  producer prices  fell
from a year earlier for the first time in 32 months as fresh
food and information-technology costs declined, underscoring the
Bank of  Korea ’s room to cut  interest rates  next month.  Prices dropped 0.1 percent in July from a year ago after a
0.8 percent increase in June, the central bank said in a
statement today. They fell 0.5 percent from the previous month.  South Korea ’s consumer inflation moderated to a 12-year low
in July, while exports fell the most since 2009. The BOK, which
left borrowing costs unchanged yesterday after a surprise cut in
July, may be waiting for another round of global easing before
it acts again, said Daewoo Securities Co.’s Yoon Yeo Sam.  “The BOK will likely cut  interest rates  in September” if
the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank act to shield
against a global downturn, Yoon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
