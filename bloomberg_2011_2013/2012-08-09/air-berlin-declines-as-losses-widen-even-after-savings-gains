Air Berlin Plc (AB1) ,  Europe ’s third-
biggest discount carrier, fell as much as 5.2 percent after its
second-quarter loss widened on increased fuel costs.  The stock dropped 9.9 cents to 1.82 euros and was trading 1
percent lower at 1.90 euros as of 9:17 a.m. in Frankfurt, taking
the decline this year to 24 percent and valuing Air Berlin at
222 million euros ($275 million).  The German airline, 29 percent owned by  Etihad Airways  of
 Abu Dhabi , had a net loss of 66.2 million euros in the quarter
versus 43.9 million euros a year earlier, it said yesterday
after markets closed. Costs reductions were 5 million euros
greater than anticipated and sales rose 1.7 percent to 1.14
billion euros even as capacity was reduced, the company said.  “We were able to compensate for sharply rising external
costs with internal measures,” Chief Executive Officer Hartmut Mehdorn said in a statement. “The revenue growth shows that we
are on the right track.”  Air Berlin is seeking 200 million euros of savings this
year from an efficiency program that limited the increase in
quarterly operating costs to 29 million euros, including oil-
price related gains. Losses were also pared by an after-tax
benefit of 15.9 million euros, the company said.  Air Berlin has cut routes and frequencies as a slowdown in
European economies hurts demand, reducing capacity by more than
1 million seats to save 250 million euros and pare debt by 50
million euros. It has also put on hold 19 jets due for delivery
this year and in 2013, and is closing bases in Erfurt and
Dortmund, shaving a further $508 million from spending.  The fleet reduction means Air Berlin will be less affected
by seasonal changes in demand, while the expansion of long-haul
flights will aid its efforts to enter “the profit zone as
planned next year,” Mehdorn said.  Etihad agreed to a $350 million package of financing and
funds for planes with Air Berlin in December. The Gulf carrier
reckons a 105 million-euro equity investment will be recouped in
extra revenue in two years, making it a better bet for cracking
the tightly regulated German market than adding new airliners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
