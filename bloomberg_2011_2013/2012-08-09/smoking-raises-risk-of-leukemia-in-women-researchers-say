Female smokers have a higher risk of
developing leukemia and Hodgkin’s lymphoma, according to a study
published in the  British Journal of Cancer .  The risks of Hodgkin’s lymphoma and some bone marrow
cancers were doubled in women who smoked about 20 cigarettes a
day compared with non-smokers in research that looked at 1.3
million middle-aged women, Cancer Research U.K. said in a
statement today.  “Smoking raises the risk of many types of cancer, not just
 lung cancer , and also the risk of heart attack and stroke, which
many people may not be aware of,” Valerie Beral, one of the
study authors and director of the Cancer Research U.K.
Epidemiology Unit at Oxford University, said in the statement.  Tobacco kills nearly six million people each year, of whom
more than five million are users and former users and more than
600,000 are non-smokers exposed to second-hand smoke, according
to the  World Health Organization . A recent survey by Cancer
Research U.K. showed that while most people know that smoking
causes cancers of the lung, mouth and throat, few are aware that
tobacco is also linked to cancers of the liver, pancreas, bowel,
kidney, cervix, and bladder.  The study was funded by the U.K. Medical Research Council
and Cancer Research U.K., a charity group that supports cancer
research and owns the British Journal of Cancer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
