Mexico ’s peso rose for a second day
as an unexpected decline in U.S. jobless claims boosted the
outlook for  Latin America ’s second-biggest economy.  The peso advanced 0.4 percent to 13.0864 per dollar at 4
p.m. in Mexico City. Today’s gain boosted its rally this year to
6.5 percent, the biggest gain among the dollar’s 16 most-traded
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  The currency rose after Labor Department data showed today
that jobless claims in the U.S. unexpectedly dropped by 6,000 to
361,000 in the week ended Aug. 4. Mexico depends on exports for
about 30 percent of its gross domestic product, sending 80
percent of the goods and services to its northern neighbor.  The better than expected U.S. unemployment data “helps
improve the confidence in the local market,”  Mario Copca , a
currency strategist at Metanalisis SA, said in a telephone
interview in Mexico City.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 rose
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.52 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.42
centavo to 140.07 centavos per peso.  Annual inflation accelerated to 4.42 percent in July from
4.34 percent the month before, the national statistics institute
said today on its website, in line with the median estimate of
12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. In the month, prices
climbed 0.56 percent.  Yields on inflation-linked bonds, known as Udibonos, due in
December 2013 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
0.14 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
