Celebi Hava Servisi AS (CLEBI) , a Turkish
airport ground handling operator, is seeking acquisitions among
European peers and plans to bid in airport operating auctions in
Spain next year, CNBCe reported, citing vice chairwoman Canan Celebioglu Tokgoz.  The Istanbul-based company also plans to add five airports
in  India  in the next five years to its operations at  New Delhi 
and Mumbai airports, according to the television channel.  The Celebioglu family, which owns Celebi Havacilik Holding
AS, Celebi Hava Servisi’s owner, and Actera Group, Turkey’s
biggest buyout firm, are entering into a partnership; the
venture will be set up after half of the holding is sold to the
buyout firm, a process likely to be completed in the next five
months, Tokgoz told CNBCe.  The partnership, to be owned equally by Actera and the
Celebioglu family, will take over 77.4 percent of the listed
Celebi Hava from the holding and family, according to a letter
of intent signed by the two sides, the holding said in a
statement to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  Aug. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
