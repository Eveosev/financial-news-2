Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , the third-
largest U.S. wireless carrier, sold $1.5 billion of bonds that
may fund debt refinancing, a network expansion and a cash
infusion for Clearwire Corp.  The company issued eight-year, 7 percent notes yielding 568
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries after
dropping an offering for 10-year bonds, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Moody’s Investors Service ranked the
bonds B3, six levels below investment grade, the ratings company
said in a statement today.  Sprint reported second-quarter revenue that beat analysts’
projections after demand for iPhones bolstered customer spending
on data plans. Sales rose 6.4 percent to $8.84 billion,  Overland
Park , Kansas-based Sprint said July 26 in a statement. Analysts
had estimated $8.73 billion on average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The communications provider may use proceeds of the sale to
fund Clearwire, a wireless carrier building a network across the
U.S., according to a  regulatory filing  today. Sprint is
Clearwire’s biggest customer.  The company last tapped the  bond market  in July. Its $1
billion of 9.125 percent bonds due March 2017 traded at 111.8
cents on the dollar yesterday for a yield of 6.13 percent in New
York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  JPMorgan Chase & Co, Deutsche Bank AG, Barclays Plc, Bank
of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
managed the sale.  Verizon Wireless  and AT&T Inc. are the two
largest U.S. carriers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
