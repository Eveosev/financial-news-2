European stocks  climbed for a fifth
day as  Nestle SA (NESN)  posted sales growth that beat estimates and a
report showed China’s inflation cooled, increasing speculation
that policy makers will do more to stimulate the economy.  Nestle, which accounts for more than 3 percent of the  Stoxx
Europe 600 Index (SXXP) , advanced 2.4 percent as higher prices helped
to increase revenue.  Novo Nordisk (NOVOB)  A/S gained 1.3 percent after
the company raised its full-year sales and profit forecasts.
 Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  slid 2 percent after saying it has lost more
customers in the U.S. than analysts had forecast.  The Stoxx 600 increased 0.4 percent to 270.26 at the close,
its highest level since March 19. The equity benchmark has
 rallied 16 percent since its 2012 low on June 4 , with nine
straight weeks of gains, as policy makers eased repayment terms
for Spanish lenders and optimism grew that central banks will
add more stimulus.  “If the figures show mild inflation and economic growth
slows down as they have recently, there’s a strong chance that
China will add stimulus,” said Pierre Mouton, a  fund manager 
who helps oversee $6.5 billion at Notz Stucki & Cie. in Geneva.
“On earnings, Nestle’s reported a very good set of results. It
helps the sector as a whole.”  The volume of shares changing hands on the Stoxx 600 was 23
percent lower than the average of the last 30 days, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The volume of securities trading on
Germany’s DAX Index was 12 percent higher than the average.  Chinese Inflation  China’s consumer prices  rose 1.8 percent from a year
earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in Beijing. That
compared with the 1.7 percent  median forecast  of 33 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey and a 2.2 percent gain in June.  The leaders of the ruling Communist Party last week pledged
to keep adjusting policies to ensure the economy expands at a
stable rate this year.  National benchmark indexes gained in 15 of the 18 western-
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index rose 0.1 percent,
while  Germany ’s DAX slipped less than 0.1 percent. France’s CAC
40 Index added 0.5 percent.  Nestle climbed 2.4 percent to 61.05 Swiss francs after  the
world’s largest food company  said sales increased 6.6 percent,
excluding acquisitions, divestments and currency shifts in the
first half of the year. That beat the average estimate of 10
analysts in a Bloomberg survey for growth of 6.3 percent.  Company Earnings  Of the 261 companies listed  on the Stoxx 600  that have
reported half-yearly profit this earnings season, 155 have
exceeded analysts’ projections, while 101 have missed them,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Novo Nordisk advanced 1.3 percent to 938 kroner after the
world’s largest insulin maker said 2012 revenue will jump 9
percent to 12 percent in local currencies, compared with a
previous forecast for an increase of 8 percent to 11 percent.
Operating profit in local currencies will climb 15 percent, more
than the previous prediction of 10 percent.  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  added 3.6 percent to 1,363 pence as
Chief Executive Officer  Peter Sands  said yesterday that a  New
York  regulator had no grounds for revoking the lender’s license.
The Department of Financial Services said that  Standard
Chartered  had processed $250 billion of transactions with
Iranian banks that were subject to sanctions.  “We reject the position and portrayal of facts by the
department,” Sands said on a conference call with reporters in
his first public comments since the regulator’s report on Aug.
6. “It would be disproportionate and wholly inconsistent with
the actions of other U.S. authorities in other sanctions
matters” to revoke the bank’s New York license, he said.  Bankia Soars  Bankia SA (BKIA) , the lender Spain nationalized in May, surged 19
percent to 1.51 euros for the largest gain on  the Stoxx 600 . The
shares have  more than doubled in price  since European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  pledged on July 26 to do whatever it
takes to preserve the euro.  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , the smartphone maker that started using
Microsoft Corp.’s operating system to revive its business,
jumped 6.5 percent to 2.28 euros after agreeing to sell its Qt
app-tools unit to Digia Oyj.  Deutsche Telekom fell 2 percent to 9.21 euros after
Germany’s largest phone company said T-Mobile USA lost 557,000
contract customers in  the second quarter , more than the 346,200
predicted by analysts.  Cable & Wireless Communications Plc (CWC)  slid 2.2 percent to
31.86 pence and  BT Group Plc (BT/A)  slipped 2.4 percent to 216.3 pence.  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  declined 4.2 percent to 1.23 euros after
projecting that net income in the second half of 2012 will fall
below profit in the first half of the year. Germany’s second-
largest lender also reported  second-quarter net income  that rose
to 275 million euros from 24 million euros a year earlier. That
topped the  average analyst estimate  of 270 million euros in a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
