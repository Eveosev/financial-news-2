Treasury 30-year bond yields reached
the highest level in seven weeks before the government sells $16
billion of the securities as added evidence of jobs gains damped
speculation the  Federal Reserve  may expand monetary stimulus.  U.S. debt   extended losses  after a report showed fewer
Americans filed applications for  unemployment benefits  last
week. Yields have risen every day since the Labor Department
reported Aug. 3 that the economy added 163,000 jobs in July, the
most since February. Demand at yesterday’s 10-year note auction
was the lowest in three years.  “If the economy is mending and things aren’t as bad as you
thought, then Treasuries are still a dicey proposition here,”
said  Brian Edmonds , head of  interest rates  at Cantor Fitzgerald
LP in New York, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the
Fed. “Does it take the Fed out? I don’t think it takes them out
completely. These are not numbers we got today that will prompt
the Fed to do anything.”  The yield on the 30-year  bond  rose four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 2.79 percent at 11:30 a.m. in New
York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3 percent
security due in May 2042 declined 3/4, or $7.50 per $1,000 face
amount, to 104 9/32. The yield reached the highest level since
June 20.  Yield Differences  The difference in yields between Treasury two- and 10-year
notes widened to 1.44 percentage points, or 144 basis points,
the most since May.  Investors should be wary of a steepening so-called yield
curve in the U.S. Treasury market, according to Pacific
Investment Management Co.’s Mohamed El-Erian.  While yields on  government securities  due in eight years
and less are anchored by Fed monetary policy, there is “a lot
more risk” in longer-maturity debt, El-Erian, the chief
executive officer of the world’s largest manager of bond funds,
said in a “Bloomberg Surveillance” radio interview with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt.  The gap between 10-year yields on Treasury Inflation-
Protected Securities and conventional U.S. government securities
reached 2.33 percentage points, the most since April 3.  The Fed’s favored bond-market gauge of inflation
expectations, the five-year, five-year measure forward breakeven
rate, which shows how much traders anticipate consumer prices
will rise during a period of five years starting in 2017, rose
to 2.56 percent on Aug. 6, the highest since June 12.  Bond Sale  The 30-year bonds being sold today yielded 2.81 percent in
pre-auction trading, versus the record low of 2.58 percent at
the previous auction on July 12. Investors  bid  for 2.7 times the
amount offered last month, up from 2.4 times in June.  “At a yield of around 2.75 percent today’s 30-year sale
does look attractive, but there are a lot of bonds to digest,”
said Craig Collins, managing director of rates trading at  Bank
of Montreal (BMO)  in  London . “We may see some further cheapening
going into the auction, but it should be well supported.”  Today’s sale will complete this week’s note and bond
auctions totaling $72 billion. The Treasury sold $24 billion of
10-year notes yesterday and $32 billion of three-year debt on
Aug. 7.  The 10-year securities drew a bid-to-cover  ratio , which
gauges demand by comparing bids submitted with the amount of
securities offered, of 2.49, the lowest level since August 2009.  The yield on the new benchmark 10-year note sold yesterday
added three basis points to 1.71 percent.  Fed Buys  U.S. government securities have returned 1.9 percent in
2012, versus 7.8 percent for an index of investment-grade and
high-yield company debt, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch data. Company bonds yield 2.67 percentage points more than
Treasuries, with the difference narrowing from 3.48 percentage
points at the end of last year, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
data show.  The Fed purchased $1.6 billion of Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities maturing from January 2025 to February 2042
today, according to the  website  of its  New York  branch. The
purchases are part of the central bank’s effort to swap shorter-
term Treasuries in its holdings with those due in six to 30
years to put downward pressure on long-term borrowing costs.  Jobless claims unexpectedly dropped by 6,000 to 361,000 in
the week ended Aug. 4, Labor Department figures showed today in
Washington. The median forecast of 43 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for an increase to 370,000.  Jobs Data  The data on U.S. jobless claims were available on the Labor
Department’s website about 15 minutes before their scheduled
release today, according to Stone & McCarthy Research
Associates. The firm was able to access jobless claims figures
from the Labor Department’s website before the embargoed time of
8:30 a.m., said Terry Sheehan, an economic analyst at Stone &
McCarthy in Princeton,  New Jersey .  Payrolls rose 163,000 in July following a revised 64,000
rise in June that was less than initially reported, Labor
Department figures showed Aug. 3 in  Washington . The median
estimate of 89 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for
a gain of 100,000. Unemployment rose to 8.3 percent.  Thirty-year yields will decline to 2.64 percent by the end
of the third quarter, according to a Bloomberg survey of banks
and securities companies with the most recent projections given
the heaviest weightings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
