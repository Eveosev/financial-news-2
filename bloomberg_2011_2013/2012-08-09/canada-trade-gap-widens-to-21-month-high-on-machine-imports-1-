Canada ’s  merchandise trade  deficit
widened to the most in 21 months in June as purchases of
machinery and equipment pushed the value of imported goods to a
record high.  Canada posted a C$1.8 billion ($1.8 billion) deficit during
the month, according to a report by Statistics Canada in Ottawa
today. The deficit was the widest since September 2010 and
exceeded forecasts for a C$1.0 billion  trade gap , according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 21 economists.
The statistics agency also raised its May deficit estimate to
C$954 million from C$793 million.  The higher imports suggests domestic demand remains buoyant
even as the  European debt crisis  and stagnant growth in the U.S
drag down demand for Canada’s commodity exports. Average prices
for commodities produced in Canada have drop 6.1 percent since
touching a 2012-high on May 2, according to  Bank of Canada   data .  “I think that’s really the story here, the slow down in
global growth and pull-back in commodity prices has undercut
exports,” said  Doug Porter , deputy chief economist at BMO
Capital Markets by phone from Toronto.  Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney has kept his key
 lending rate  at 1 percent since September 2010, the longest
pause since the 1950s, and in July cut his economic growth
forecast citing global weakness and the weakest export recovery
since World War II.  Dollar Gains  The Canadian dollar appreciated 0.25 percent versus its
U.S. counterpart to 99.18 Canadian cents at 10:30 a.m. in
Toronto, after Carney said in an interview with the BBC he may
need to raise  interest rates . One Canadian dollar buys $1.0083.  Exports rose 0.2 percent to C$39.1 billion in June, as
automotive product sales rose to the highest since January 2006,
helping offset declines in energy and agricultural products.
Shipments of crude oil declined 5.3 percent to C$5.6 billion.  Imports rose 2.3 percent to C$40.9 billion as purchases of
machinery and equipment also rose to a record $11.2 billion,
 Statistics Canada  said.  The volume of exports rose 1.1 percent and import volumes
gained 2.5 percent, Statistics Canada said. Volume figures
adjust for price changes and can be a better indicator of how
trade contributes to economic growth.  Canada’s trade surplus with the U.S. narrowed to C$3.09
billion in June, the lowest since August 2011, from C$3.23
billion a month earlier as imports from Canada’s largest trading
partner reached a record high of C$25.9 billion, Statistics
Canada said.  Canada’s trade deficit with countries other than the U.S.
widened to C$4.9 billion in June from C$4.2 billion the month
before, as exports to the rest of the world fell for the third
consecutive month.  In a separate report, Statistics Canada said the country’s
new home  price index  rose 0.2 percent in June, its 15th straight
gain, led by higher prices in Toronto.  Economists predicted the index would rise 0.2 percent,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg  survey  with 10
responses.  From a year earlier, new  home prices  increased 2.3 percent
in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
