Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) ,  Australia ’s
second-largest oil and gas company, may be able to pay a special
dividend because of rising revenue from its A$15 billion ($15.9
billion) Pluto liquefied natural gas project, UBS AG said.  A dividend payment this year or in 2013 depends on the
Perth-based company deferring spending on its proposed Pluto
expansion and the Browse and Sunrise LNG projects,  Gordon Ramsay , a UBS analyst in  Melbourne , said yesterday in a report.  The company last month boosted its 2012 output forecast as
much as 14 percent following the start of Pluto in April. The
LNG development operated at 80 percent of capacity in its first
two months, compared with Woodside’s forecast of 36 percent, the
company said July 19. It’s projected to pay a dividend of $1.22
a share in 2012 and $1.45 a share in 2013, according to UBS.  “This may be conservative if Pluto LNG’s operational
performance continues to be strong,” Ramsay wrote.  While Woodside is committed to its growth plans, which
include expanding Pluto, the oil and gas producer will be able
to return cash to shareholders “to the extent that growth is
delayed, or our investment criteria is not met,” Chief
Financial Officer Lawrie Tremaine told investors in May.  Laura Lunt, a spokeswoman for Woodside in Perth, declined
in an e-mail to comment on the report.  Woodside shares rose 0.7 percent to A$34.43 at the close in
Sydney, while the benchmark index fell 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
