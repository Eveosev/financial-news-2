Coverage for homeowners who have
lapsed on existing policies lacks oversight and the market
resembles a monopoly, said James Donelon, commissioner of the
Louisiana Department of Insurance.  The so-called force-placed insurance industry in the U.S.
has “grown into a monopoly situation that is perpetuating
itself,” Donelon said today at a hearing in Atlanta held by the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners. “The system is
being extremely profitable for the two remaining companies in
the market. Nobody is minding the store.”  Donelon said he was referring to  Assurant Inc. (AIZ)  and QBE
Insurance Group Ltd.  To contact the reporters on this story:
