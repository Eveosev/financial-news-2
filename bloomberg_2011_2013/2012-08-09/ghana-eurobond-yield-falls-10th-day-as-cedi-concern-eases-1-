The yield on  Ghana ’s $750 million
Eurobond declined for a 10th day to lowest in more than four
months, signaling concern eased the cedi’s depreciation will
make it difficult for the government to repay debt.  The yield on 8.5 percent 2017 bond fell 13 basis points, or
0.13 percentage point, to 5.359 percent as of 2:51 p.m. in
Accra, the lowest on a closing basis since March 28.  “The continuing fall in yields shows that investors still
maintain belief in the country despite the change in leadership
and the fall in the currency,” Kojo Amoo-Gottfried and Kunal Vora, London-based research analysts at FM Capital Partners
Ltd., said in an e-mailed note today. “The country still has
net foreign currency reserves, estimated at $2.78 billion, which
is more than sufficient for a $750 million bond.”  Ghana’s cedi fell 2.4 percent in June and pared the loss to
0.8 percent last month. The currency of the world’s second-
biggest cocoa producer lost less than 0.1 percent to 1.9559 a
dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Former Vice President John Dramani Mahama was sworn in as
leader on July 24 following the death of President John Atta
Mills earlier that day. Bank of Ghana Governor Kwesi Amissah- Arthur was sworn in as the new vice president on Aug. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
