Egypt  suspended Al-Faraeen satellite
channel for one month and warned that its license may be
revoked, state-run Nile News reported.  The owner and one of the channel’s anchors are under
investigation by State Security prosecutors for allegedly
inciting violence, the state-run Middle East  News Agency 
reported.  Tawfiq Okasha, the journalist involved, confirmed the
authorities have cut the station’s transmissions, while denying
the allegations that he’s incited the killing of President
Mohamed Mursi or sought to topple the government.  “That’s an expected decision given the battle between me
and the Brotherhood,” Okasha said by phone from Cairo today,
referring to the Muslim Brotherhood.  Mursi in May filed a lawsuit against Okasha, a supporter of
the military council and the deposed Mubarak administration,
accusing him of public defamation and slander.  To contact the reporter on this story:
