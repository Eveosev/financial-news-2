The leader of a Muslim sect in  Russia 
faces prosecution for keeping dozens of followers, including
children, living in an underground bunker for about a decade,
according to state media.  Faizrakhman Satarov, 83, faces a maximum of six months in
prison for violating local building regulations, Irina Petrova,
a spokeswoman for the prosecutor’s  office  in the city of Kazan,
the capital of central Russia’s Muslim-majority republic of
Tatarstan, said by phone today.  At least three cult members also face criminal charges for
parental negligence, she said. Twenty children were in the sect,
including 12 of pre-school age, and will be kept away from their
parents while authorities decide whether to put them into foster
care, according to the prosecutor’s office. The children were
denied medical care and schooling, Petrova said.  About 70 people lived in the bunker without any natural
light or heating, state news service RIA Novosti said. The
crackdown on the sect follows a car blast in Kazan last month
that injured the top cleric in Tatarstan and the shooting dead
of his deputy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
