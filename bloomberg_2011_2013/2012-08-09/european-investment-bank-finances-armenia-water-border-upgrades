The  European Investment Bank  is
lending  Armenia  almost 37 million euros ($45 million) to help
upgrade municipal water and sewage facilities and construct
three crossing points on the border with Georgia.  The bulk of the financing will be to develop border
crossings and improve access roads at Bagratashen, Bavra and
Gogavan, the European Unionâ€™s bank said. Loans to improve the
drinking water supply and wastewater treatment will aid about
300,000 residents of 17 towns in Armenia, the EIB said in a
website statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
