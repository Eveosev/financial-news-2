Warner Chilcott Plc (WCRX) , a drugmaker
specializing in woman’s health and dermatology, set the  interest
rate  it will pay of $600 million on loans the company is seeking
to fund a shareholder dividend, according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction.  The five-year $300 million B-4/5 portion will pay interest
at 3 percentage points to 3.25 percentage points more than the
London interbank offered rate, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because the terms are private.  Warner Chilcott is proposing to sell the loan at 99 to 99.5
cents on the dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the
company and boosting the yield to investors.  A $300 million B-6 piece due in March 2018 will pay
interest at 3.25 percentage points more than Libor with a 1
percent floor, according to the person. The debt is expected to
be sold to investors at 99 cents, the person said.  Lenders on both term loans will be offered one-year soft
call protection of 101 cents, the person said, meaning the
company would have to pay 1 cent more than face value to
refinance the debt during its first year.  The debt is rated Ba3 by Moody’s Investors Service and BBB-
by  Standard & Poor’s .  Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are
arranging the debt for the Dublin-based company and investors
must let the banks know by Aug. 14 at 5 p.m. in  New York  whether
they will participate in the transaction, the person said. The
deal is expected to close and fund the week of Aug. 20.  A group including Thomas H. Lee Partners LP, Bain Capital
LLC, and the buyout units of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Credit
Suisse Group AG took the drugmaker private in 2005 for about 1.6
billion pounds ($2.1 billion) and brought it public again in
2006. Credit Suisse sold its stake in 2010.  Emily Hill, of  Warner Chilcott ’s investor relations
department, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
