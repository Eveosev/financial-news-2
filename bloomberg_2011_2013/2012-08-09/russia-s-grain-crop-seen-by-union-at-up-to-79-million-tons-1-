Russia’s grain crop will be 78
million to 79 million metric tons, including 45 million to 46
million tons of wheat in 2012-13, said Arkady Zlochevsky,
president of the country’s Grain Union.  The government expects the grain crop to be 75 million to
80 million tons, including 45 million tons of wheat, Agriculture
Minister Nikolai Fedorov said yesterday. That compares with 94
million tons of grains, including 56.2 million tons of wheat
last year, according to the state statistics service. When the
country had a drought two years ago the crop was 60.9 million
tons, including 41.5 million tons of wheat, the statistics data
show.  The union figures include grains which farmers will
“hide” as they did in the 2010 drought to get cash
compensation from the state, Zlochevsky said today, adding he
expects the official figures to be below the union’s estimate.
There has been speculation that dry weather will curb crops in
the country this year.  Russia was the world’s third biggest wheat exporter last
season after it shipped 21.3 million tons of the cereal, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  estimated. This year, as the
country’s crop is seen falling because of drought, wheat
shipments may decline to 11 million tons, according to USDA’s
 Foreign Agricultural Service  in Moscow.  Total grain exports are expected to be at least 10 million
to 12 million tons, Zlochevsky said. Russia’s exportable surplus
could be 16 million to 17 million tons, at which level domestic
needs could still be met, he said.  July Exports  The country exported 2.07 million tons of grains in July,
according to Agriculture Ministry data. August exports are
expected to be 2.5 million to 2.7 million tons, Zlochevsky
estimated. That would be down from 3.3 million tons last year,
he said.  Siberia may harvest 12 million tons of grain this year,
which is “quite a normal level” despite the drought,
Zlochevsky said. The Siberian federal district harvested 14.6
million tons of grains last year, or 15.6 percent of the
national crop, according to the state statistics data.  Wheat for December delivery rose 0.7 percent to $9.2025 a
bushel at 5:58 p.m. Moscow time. The cereal has advanced 41
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
