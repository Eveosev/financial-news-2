Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (TSEM)  dropped the
most in a year after the maker of customized chips reported a
second-quarter loss and said this quarter’s sales will fall
short of analysts’ estimates.  The shares of the Migdal Haemek, Israel-based company fell
13 percent, the most since August 2011, to 36.30 shekels at the
close in Tel Aviv. Tower tumbled 14 percent to $8.84 at 11:07
a.m. in  New York , headed for the biggest drop since December
2008.  EZchip Semiconductor Ltd. (EZCH)  plunged 22 percent, the most
since October 2008, to 118 shekels after second-quarter sales
missed estimates by about 50 percent.  Israel ’s benchmark stock
index lost 0.3 percent.  Tower posted a loss of $9.4 million compared with a profit
of $1.7 million a year earlier, according to a statement filed
with the  Tel-Aviv  Stock Exchange today. Third-quarter sales will
be between $152 million and $162 million, Tower said in the
statement. The mean estimate of three analysts is for sales of
$174 million, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  “The guidance is disappointing and it doesn’t look like
they will get the $200 million in fourth-quarter sales that
investors were expecting,” Eran Jacoby, head of research at DS
Securities & Investments Ltd., said by phone from Tel Aviv.
“This is overshadowing margin improvements they’ve been
making.”  Tower said operating margins improved to 31 percent in the
second quarter from 26 percent a year earlier.  “We are seeing some discrete markets declining as
consumers move from PCs to tablets and smartphones,” Chief
Executive Officer Russell Ellwanger said in a phone interview
today. “And with the shift to these devices, we are seeing
demand from our other customers, such as  Skyworks Solutions
Inc. (SWKS) , whose technology is at the heart of all advanced
smartphones.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
