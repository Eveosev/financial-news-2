Ukrainian farmers reaped 1.18 million
metric tons of rapeseed as of Aug. 8 as yields rose by 29
percent this year compared with 2011,  UkrAgroConsult  said.  The country gathered rapeseed from 530,000 hectares (1.31
million acres), or 94 percent of the target area, since the
harvest began last month, the Kiev-based agriculture researcher
said in an e-mailed statement. The average yield rose to 2.23
tons a hectare, compared with 1.73 tons last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
