Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway ’s state-
controlled oil company, is seeking permission to build a wind
farm with floating turbines off the U.S. Atlantic coast.  Statoil  requested  a commercial lease for its Hywind Maine
project, which will have four turbines with 12 megawatts of
capacity about 12 nautical miles (22 kilometers) from shore, the
U.S. Interior Department said today in a statement.  The agency has awarded only one commercial lease for
offshore wind development, for the Cape Wind project in
 Massachusetts ’s Nantucket Sound, which has been in development
for a decade and hasn’t begun construction. The Obama
administration is seeking to accelerate the review of renewable-
energy projects on the outer continental shelf and is
considering  proposals  for offshore wind farms in 16 states on
the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, all using standard turbines.  “This is the first time that this innovative floating
technology is being considered for development in deeper waters
offshore our coasts,”  David Hayes , deputy secretary of the
Interior, said in the statement.  The agency is also evaluating proposals for undersea
transmission lines that may connect 7 gigawatts of offshore wind
farms in the mid-Atlantic.  The Interior Department has begun an environmental review
of the proposed area and also will determine whether there’s
competitive interest from other developers. The review will be
completed faster if Statoil, based in Stavanger, Norway, is the
only company planning offshore wind farms in the area, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
