The ruble gained a second day as the
price of crude oil,  Russia ’s main export earner, increased on
speculation  China  will take more steps to bolster growth.  The ruble traded 0.2 percent stronger at 34.9209 against
the central bank’s target euro-dollar basket, which it uses to
smooth exchange-rate moves that can hurt exporters. It was
little changed at 31.5354 per dollar and appreciated 0.3 percent
to 38.92 against the euro at 1:36 p.m. in Moscow.  Oil gained as much as 0.6 percent before trading 0.4
percent higher at $93.68 a barrel in  New York . A deceleration in
consumer price gains may encourage Chinese policy makers to
introduce more measures to support growth, aiding efforts to
reverse an economic slowdown that’s lasted six quarters. Crude
and natural gas contribute about 50 percent of Russia’s state
revenue, according to government estimates.  “We see a bit of volatility in the ruble these days,”
Andrey Volkov, head of foreign exchange and money markets at ZAO
Natexis Bank in Moscow, said today. The “risk-on atmosphere”
in  emerging markets  after European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi  outlined a bond-buying plan last week “is starting to
vanish,” he wrote in an e-mailed note today.  Investors increased bets on the currency weakening, with
non-deliverable forwards showing it at 32.0267 per dollar in
three months, compared with expectations of 32.0133 per dollar
on Aug. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
