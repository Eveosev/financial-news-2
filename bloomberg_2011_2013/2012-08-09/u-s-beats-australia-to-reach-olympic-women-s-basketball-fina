Diana Taurasi and Tina Charles had 14
points each as the U.S. women’s basketball team rallied in the
second half to beat  Australia  86-73 and reach the gold-medal
game of the Olympics.  Sue Bird added 13 points for the Americans, the defending
champions, who trailed Australia 47-43 at halftime at North
Greenwich Arena in  London . The U.S. took a 57-56 lead with 2:36
remaining in the third quarter on a lay-up by Lindsay Whalen and
never trailed again, reaching the event’s final for the fifth
consecutive Olympics.  The Americans will meet  Russia  or  France  for the title on
Aug. 11.  The U.S. team hasn’t lost an Olympic game since the
semifinals in 1992, when it dropped a 79-73 decision to the
Unified Team, made up of Russia and other parts of the former
 Soviet Union . The U.S. followed that defeat with a victory over
Cuba to win the bronze medal and is 40-0 in Olympic play since
the loss, winning gold medals in each of the past four games.  The U.S. also won gold medals at the World Championships in
1998, 2002 and 2010. The team won bronze in 2006 when it lost in
the semifinals to Russia.  In that stretch, Australia emerged as one of the U.S.
team’s strongest opponents, winning the World Championship that
escaped the Americans in 2006, bronze at the 1996 Olympics in
Atlanta and silver in each of the past three Olympics. Australia
is 31-8 in Olympic play since the start of the 1996 Games, with
six losses coming to the U.S., three in gold-medal matches.  The U.S. team has three former Women’s National Basketball
Association Most Valuable Players -- Tamika Catchings, Candace
Parker and Taurasi -- and every player has been a WNBA All-Star
at least once. The team returns nine players from the squad that
won gold at the World Championships two years ago.  Elizabeth Cambage, picked second in the 2011 WNBA Draft by
the Tulsa Shock, led Australia with 19 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
