SunPower Corp. (SPWR) , the solar-panel
company majority-owned by  Total SA (FP) , fell the most in six months
after it cut its 2012 sales forecast.  SunPower dropped 10 percent to $4.20 at the close in New
York, the most since Feb. 7. The shares have dropped 33 percent
this year.  Revenue for 2012 will range from $2.4 billion to $2.6
billion, San Jose, California-based SunPower said in a statement
yesterday after the close of regular trading on U.S. markets,
compared with a May 3 forecast of $2.6 billion to $3 billion.  The companyâ€™s second-quarter loss narrowed to $84.2
million, or 71 cents a share, from $147.9 million, or $1.51, a
year earlier. Analysts were expecting a loss of 85 cents, the
average of seven estimates  compiled  by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
