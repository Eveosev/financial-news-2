Peru ’s sol fell from a 15-year high
after the central bank bought dollars in the  spot market  to ease
gains in the local currency.  The sol fell 0.1 percent to 2.6175 per  U.S. dollar ,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. Yesterday it closed
at 2.616, its strongest level since 1997,  data  from Peru’s
financial regulator shows.  Exporters buying soles to pay local taxes this month are
pushing gains in the currency, and Peru’s unexpected trade
surplus in June is also leading to bets for stronger inflows,
according to Gonzalo Navarro, the head trader at  Banco Santander 
in Lima. The central bank acted to stem the advance, he said.  “The central bank has been intervening even as bank dollar
holdings are low,” Navarro said in a phone interview from Lima.
“Investors are betting on a stronger sol given tax inflows and
the  trade surplus  that was much higher than expected.”  The central bank  bought  $16 million in the spot market
today, extending its purchases this month to $21 million.  Peru posted a $442 million trade surplus in June, the
nation’s statistics agency said in a report today, up from a
revised $58 million surplus in May and compared to the median
forecast among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg for a $30 million
trade deficit.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due in August 2020 rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 4.57 percent, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.16 centimo to 121.55
centimos per sol.  Peru’s policy makers will probably leave the  benchmark
interest rate  unchanged for a 15th consecutive month at 4.25
percent, according to all 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
The central bank board, led by bank President Julio Velarde,
will announce its decision at about 6 p.m. in  Lima .  To contact the reporter on this story:
