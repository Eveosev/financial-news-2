Current and former board members of
the East Ramapo Central School District in  New York ’s Rockland
County were accused by parents in a lawsuit of taking money away
from public education in favor of Jewish institutions.  Dozens of parents alleged that the board systematically
allowed children qualifying for special education to be
transferred to private Jewish schools at the district’s expense,
according to a complaint filed yesterday in  Manhattan  federal
court,  The parents further alleged that the board arranged with
area Jewish school directors to distribute Title I funding to
religious schools and allowed for public funds to be used to buy
Jewish textbooks. The board also hastily approved a deal to sell
an elementary school building to a Jewish organization for less
than its initial appraisal, even as the East Ramapo district was
cutting the budget for programs at the public schools, according
to the complaint.  The defendants “have engaged in numerous schemes to siphon
off public money to support private religious institutions in
various yeshivas, forcing a large cut in instructional
programming in the public schools to a degree that the right of
public school children to an education is impugned,” attorneys
Arthur Schwartz and Stephanie Torre wrote in the complaint.  Joel Klein , the district’s superintendent, didn’t
immediately respond to a phone message yesterday seeking comment
on the complaint.  The case is Montesa v. Schwartz, 12-cv-06057, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
