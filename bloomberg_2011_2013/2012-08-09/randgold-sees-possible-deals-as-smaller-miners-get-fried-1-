Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS) , a miner of
the precious metal in  Africa , said it sees possible acquisitions
as the value of gold explorers on the continent tumbles.  “Junior explorers are busy being fried by the market and
it’s a cheap way to do exploration,” Chief Executive Officer
 Mark Bristow  said today in an interview in London. “There are a
lot of people in a lot of difficulty at the moment so it’s
natural that we look at these things.”  Gold producers, many of which have struggled to raise funds
for mines while paying higher operating costs, have seen their
valuations drop as investors abandon stocks in favor of physical
bullion and exchange-traded funds. Gold shares in the  Standard &
Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (STGOLD)  have fallen 28 percent in a year.  Randgold said it would only look at projects with reserves
of more than 3 million ounces of gold and able to return 20
percent on money invested at a price of $1,000 an ounce. The
 Jersey , Channel Islands-based producer hasn’t bought a company
since acquiring Moto Goldmines Ltd. in 2009.  “M&A is not our core business, but it’s definitely on our
radar,” Bristow said. “We keep a database of all juniors and
we monitor them.”  Randgold earlier today said second-quarter profit rose 3.7
percent to $117.5 million after gold output increased to 210,534
ounces. The company is on schedule to meet the mid-range of its
825,000-to-865,000-ounce full-year target, Bristow said.  Randgold rose 1.6 percent to 6,290 pence by the close in
London trading, the highest in more than four months.  Cash costs declined to $703 an ounce in the second quarter
from $751 an ounce in the prior three months, Randgold said.
Costs for 2012 will average $650 an ounce as it mines higher-
grade ore at  Mali ’s Loulo mine in the second half, and will be
in the “500s” by year-end, Bristow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
