Canada  is helping fund a project at
Weston Foods Inc. to test a water recycling system that treats
wastewater from a food processing facility on site.  The C$95,000 ($95,600) investment awarded to the company,
which specializes in baked goods, will go toward an on-site bio-
digester for wastewater treatment that will allow water to be
re-used or disposed of, not discharged in municipal sewers,
mitigating food processing’s environmental footprint.  The project though the Canadian Agricultural Adaptation
Program “has the potential to increase profitability and
competitiveness of processors across the country by testing
innovative approaches to water treatment,” parliament memeber
Bernard Trottier said in a government statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
