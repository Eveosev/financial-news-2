Peru ’s  trade  surplus narrowed in June
as slowing global growth crimped demand for the country’s
metals, natural-gas and fishmeal.  The surplus was $442 million in June, compared to a revised
$58 million surplus in May and a $1.02 billion surplus in June a
year ago, Peru’s national statistics agency said in an e-mailed
report today. Analysts expected a $30 million trade deficit,
according to the median estimate of seven economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Exports fell 14 percent to $3.57 billion in June, as gold
sales abroad dropped 29 percent and copper and natural-gas
exports both slid 15.5 percent. Imports led by industrial
machinery and cars rose 0.1 percent to $3.1 billion.  An economic slowdown in China and  Europe  has caused metal
prices to fall, weakening exports in the world’s third-largest
copper producer. Copper has declined 14 percent in the past 12
months on the Comex exchange in  New York . Central bank President
Julio Velarde said Aug. 6 that flagging European demand has also
cut Peru’s textile exports.  The Peruvian sol was little changed at 2.6175 per  U.S.
dollar  at 1:28 p.m. in Lima.  To contact the reporters on this story:
