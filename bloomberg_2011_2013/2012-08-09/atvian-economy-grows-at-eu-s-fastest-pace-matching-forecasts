Latvia’s  economy  expanded at the
quickest pace in the European Union in the second quarter,
fueled by trade, manufacturing and construction.  Gross domestic product grew a preliminary 5.1 percent from
a year earlier compared with a revised 6.8 percent advance in
the first quarter, the  statistics office , based in the capital,
Riga, said today by e-mail. That matches a 5.1 percent median
estimate of six economists in a Bloomberg survey. GDP rose 1
percent from the previous quarter.  Latvia is rebounding from the world’s deepest recession in
2008-2009, which erased almost a quarter of economic output
after a property bubble bust and credit inflows dried up,
prompting an  International Monetary Fund  bailout. GDP grew 5.5
percent last year, buoyed by exports and industrial output, and
may expand 3.5 percent in 2012, the IMF predicts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
