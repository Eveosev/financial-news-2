AS Estonian Air’s financial results
are “clearly” weaker than expected, Economy Minister Juhan Parts told  Eesti Paeevaleht  in an interview, without disclosing
details.  The government, which owns 90 percent of the national
carrier, hasn’t received requests for additional financing, the
newspaper said. Estonian Air should consider releasing earnings
reports on a quarterly basis or at least twice a year, rather
than once a year, EPL cited Parts as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
