FuturaGene Plc, held by  Suzano Papel
e Celulose SA (SUZB5) , began trials in northwest China to test the
potential of woody crops and shrubs that reclaim desert to help
boost the economy for local farmers.  The company is working on four field trials in  Gansu
province  to study whether the plants can fight desertification,
enable soil regeneration and be used as biomass and in biofuel,
Sao Paulo-based FuturaGene said today in an e-mailed statement.
The trials will run for four years.  “We’re dealing with very poor communities with very
degraded agricultural land,” Chief Executive Officer Stanley Hirsch said in an interview in  London . “Farming practice in
these places is very simple and it’s very difficult for these
communities to actually derive a livelihood from agricultural
land.”  Desertification of land caused by factors such as wind and
water erosion is a “major ecological” problem in China, with
as much as 30 percent of land affected. Vegetation in affected
areas in northern  China  requires “significant improvement” to
boost the local ecosystem and bring economic benefits, Hirsch
said in the statement.  Once the trials are complete the plant varieties with the
most potential will be improved through breeding and
biotechnology and FuturaGene intends to replicate the project in
similar environments across the world, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
