Usain Bolt won the 200-meter gold
medal at the  London  Olympics to complete a historic sweep of the
track sprints that the Jamaican runner said he needed to become
a sports legend.  Bolt won in 19.32 seconds at the Olympic Stadium. Yohan Blake got the silver in 19.44 and Warren Weir took bronze in
19.84 as the Jamaican teammates captured all three medals.  The 25-year-old Bolt became the only man to successfully
defend both the 100- and 200-meter titles at an Olympics, and
the first runner to retain two titles since  Finland ’s Lasse
Viren won the 5,000- and 10,000-meters at the Montreal Olympics
in 1976. Bolt set an Olympic record of 9.63 seconds when he
cruised to his 100-meter victory on Aug. 5.  “This is what I wanted and I got it,” Bolt said in a
televised trackside interview. “I’m very proud of myself.”  Bolt is the only person to have run below 9.60 in the 100
meters and under 19.20 in the 200 meters. He broke his own world
records in both distances at the 2009 world championships in
Berlin, where he ran 9.58 to win the 100 meters and 19.19 to
take the 200.  The Jamaican enjoyed his usual pre-race preparations,
sharing a fist bump with both a volunteer by his block and
Blake. He drew the loudest cheer when he waved at the capacity
80,000 crowd in a manner akin to that of  Queen Elizabeth II , the
British monarch.  Once the gun sounded, Bolt led the field, and even with
Blake approaching his shoulder, the champion slowed slightly and
put his right-index finger to his lips before crossing the line
in a time that equaled the mark set by  Michael Johnson  when the
American won gold at the Atlanta Games in 1996.  Final Glide  Bolt, whose 6-foot-5 frame helps him glide through the
final strides of the sprints, only took up the 100 meters as
speed work to prepare for the longer race. He said after winning
the 100 meters in London that he may tackle the 400 meters for
the first time.  Bolt’s face has adorned magazine covers and billboards in
London, while competitors at the games have mobbed him whenever
he ventures out of his apartment at the athletes’ village. Known
as “Lightning Bolt,” he’s thrilled crowds with antics before
getting set in the starting blocks and celebrates victories with
an archer’s pose that he’s made his own.  Bolt’s sponsor Puma AG said he created media value of more
than $105 million after claiming double gold and extending his
world records in the 100 and 200 meters at the 2009 world
championships.  Questions Answered  Bolt came into the London Games with question marks about
his form and fitness after losing in both the 100 and 200 meters
to Blake, his training partner, in his last competitive races.  Those were all answered in the Olympic 100. Coming from as
far back as sixth, Bolt cruised past his opponents with long
strides, leaving Blake, 22, to take silver ahead of the U.S.’s
Justin Gatlin in the shorter sprint.  “I had a rough season, but I came out here and did what I
had to do,” Bolt said after the 200.  Apart from Bolt, only eight men have completed the 100- and
200-meter sweep at one Olympics. Of those only  Carl Lewis 
successfully defended the gold medal in the shorter race.  After making history Bolt kissed the track before going on
a celebratory lap of honor with the other Jamaican medalists,
stopping to embrace his mother, Jennifer; perform his archer’s
pose; and then do a single push-up when he returned to the
finish line.  “I know my coach is probably going crazy right now,” he
said of the Jamaican medals sweep. “We’ve been working hard all
season and we’ve pushed out each other.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
