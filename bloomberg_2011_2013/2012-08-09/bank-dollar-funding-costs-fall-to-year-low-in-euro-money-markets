The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars declined to the lowest in more than a year, according
to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into U.S. dollars, was
33.5 basis points below the euro interbank offered rate, or
Euribor, at 9:30 a.m. in  London , from minus 37 yesterday. It’s
the lowest cost since July 25, 2011.  The one-year basis swap was 38.5 basis points below
Euribor, the lowest since Aug. 3, 2011, from minus 39. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  The three-month Eonia OIS swap was at 7.2 basis points,
compared with 7.4 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight
indexed average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at
11.6 basis points yesterday, the highest since July 23, from
11.1 the day before.  Banks cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
 European Central Bank  to 278 billion euros ($344 billion)
yesterday, the lowest since Dec. 21, from 317 billion euros the
day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
