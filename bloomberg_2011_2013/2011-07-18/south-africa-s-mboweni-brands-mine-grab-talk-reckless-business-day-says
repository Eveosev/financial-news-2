Tito Mboweni, former governor of
South  Africa ’s central bank, said a debate about nationalizing
the country’s mines is being “handled recklessly,” undermining
investor confidence in Africa’s biggest economy,  Business Day 
reported.  The manner of the nationalization debate lacks an
“appreciation for the consensus-building spirit which has
informed the construction of new and ongoing agreement in our
society,” the Johannesburg-based newspaper cited Mboweni as
saying in a speech last week.  While miners in South Africa could have done more to
increase the role of black workers in the industry, the global
financial crisis has hampered their efforts, Mboweni said,
according to Business Day.  Julius Malema , leader of the youth wing of the ruling
African National Congress party, has called for nationalization
of  South Africa ’s mines and the seizure of farms without
compensation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
