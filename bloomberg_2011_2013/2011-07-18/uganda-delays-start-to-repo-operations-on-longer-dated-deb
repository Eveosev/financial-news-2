Uganda ’s central bank said it will
delay the start of repurchase operations on  government bonds 
because it is pursuing a tight monetary policy and doesn’t want
to put more money into the banking system.  The repos on debt with a maturity of more than 14 days
won’t start in the “short term,” Adam Mugume, Bank of Uganda’s
director of research, said in an interview on July 15 in the
capital, Kampala. Repurchase operations on 14-day bills will
continue, he said.  Mugume had said on June 23 that the repurchase operations
on longer-dated debt may start as early as this month.  The central bank set its new benchmark interest rate at 13
percent on July 6 as a first step toward implementing an
inflation-targeting policy. The bank will aim to bring the  core
inflation  rate to 5 percent “over the medium term,” Governor
Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile said.  Core inflation, which excludes food, energy and water
costs, accelerated to an annual 12.2 percent in June from 11.3
percent in May, according to the statistics office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
