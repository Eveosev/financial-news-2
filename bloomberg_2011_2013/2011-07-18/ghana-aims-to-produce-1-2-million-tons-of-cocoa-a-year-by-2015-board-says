Ghana , the world’s second-largest
cocoa producer, plans to increase production to about 1.2
million metric tons of the beans a year by 2015 because of new
tree plantings.  As much as 600,000 hectares (1.48 million acres) will be
replanted as part of a six-year program which ends in 2017, Yaw
Adu-Ampomah, deputy chief executive officer of the Ghana Cocoa
Board, said in an interview in Accra on July 15.  The board will provide the seedlings and fertilizers to
assist farmers in the planting of new seeds, he said. The cost
of the project is an estimated 200 million cedis ($132 million),
with the government spending 126 million and the rest from
companies including Mars Inc., maker of M&M’s, Cadbury Plc,
owned by  Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT)  and Amajaro Holdings Ltd. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
