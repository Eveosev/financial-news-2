Liberia has identified 13 more oil
blocks for exploration in addition to the 17 that were
previously demarcated, said Christopher Neyor, president of the
west African country’s National Oil Co.  Companies are still in the early stages of exploring
Liberia’s oil potential, Neyor said at a conference in the
capital, Monrovia, on July 15.  The West African nation is rebuilding its economy and
infrastructure after a civil war that ended in 2003. Liberia
signed 10 oil exploration agreements between 2006 and 2010 with
companies including  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and Nigeria’s Oranto Petroleum
Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
