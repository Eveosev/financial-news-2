Ukraine’s President  Viktor Yanukovych  urged the National Commission for Energy Regulation
to set “fair” energy bills.  “Strict conditions have been set by the president, who
said that the issue is of utmost importance,” said the head of
the commission, Valeriy Saratov, after meeting Yanukovych in
Crimea, according to a  statement  on the website of the
presidential office in Kiev.  Yanukovych also urged the Regional Development Ministry to
ensure all households in Ukraine have energy and water meters,
according to his office’s  website . Water meters are installed at
40 percent of households and heat meters at 23 percent of homes,
according to the website.  Ukraine’s authorities are taking steps to help release a
third tranche of the International Monetary Fund’s $15.6 billion
bailout approved in the summer of 2010. The eastern European
nation has so far received two payments totaling $3.4 billion
and the third disbursement has been delayed since March. One of
the key challenges is for the government to increase gas and
utility bills to reduce state budget subsidies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
