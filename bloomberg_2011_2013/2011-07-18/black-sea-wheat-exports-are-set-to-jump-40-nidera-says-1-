Wheat exports from the  Black Sea
region  are set to jump as much as 40 percent this month as
buyers seek cheaper supplies from Russia and Ukraine, according
to grain trader Nidera SA.  Shipments from the countries and  Kazakhstan  may reach 3
million to 3.5 million metric tons in July, said Francesca Kleemans, director of strategy and research at the Nidera
Handelscompagnie BV trading arm. That compares with 2.5 million
tons a year earlier.  “In the Black Sea area, we are going to see a huge
crop,” Kleemans said in a telephone interview today. “It’s
going to come out, and it will find good buyers. All of those
who haven’t bought are lining up.”  Russia and Ukraine resumed grain exports this month after
imposing restrictions in 2010 as a drought led to crop losses.
 Egypt  bought Russian-grown wheat this month for the first time
since last year. The eastern European country has a cost
advantage of as much as $40 a ton over wheat from the U.S. and
western  Europe , according to Paris-based farm adviser Agritel.  “The effect of the Black Sea crop is priced in,” Kleemans
said. The “Black Sea crop will find very eager buyers, but I
think the next turn of the story is the rainy weather in Europe
and whether this might create some more availability, especially
of feed-quality wheat.”  Egypt agreed to buy a total of 360,000 tons of Russian
wheat in two tenders this month. Nidera, which is based in
Rotterdam and has roots going back to 1920, will deliver 120,000
tons of that amount.  To contact the reporter on this story:
