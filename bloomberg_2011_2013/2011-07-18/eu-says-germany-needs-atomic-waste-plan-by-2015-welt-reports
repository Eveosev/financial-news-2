European Union Energy Commissioner
Guenther Oettinger said  Germany  has until 2015 to decide where
it will store its nuclear waste,  Welt  reported.  If Germany does not produce a plan for the final storage of
nuclear waste within that period, the EU could instigate legal
proceedings, the newspaper reported, citing an interview to be
published on July 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
