Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ,  Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  tumbled to their lowest
prices for at least 17 months in  London  after stress tests
exposed the potential for losses from sovereign and real-estate
investments.  Lloyds fell 7.5 percent to 41.35 pence at the close of
London trading, the lowest price since June 2009. RBS dropped 6
percent to 32.97 pence, its lowest since February 2010, while
Barclays declined 7 percent to 207.65 pence, the lowest level
since April 2009. The 46-member Bloomberg 500 Banks and
Financial Services Index fell to its lowest since April 2009.  “It’s a further reaction to the outcome of the stress
tests,” said Simon Willis, an analyst at Daniel Stewart
Securities Plc. “HSBC comes our relatively soundly and  Standard
Chartered  wasn’t included. There is little reason from the
stress tests for any significant relief.”  European banks may have to raise as much as 80 billion
euros ($112 billion) of additional capital after stress tests
conducted by the European Banking Authority released on July 15
failed to allay investor concern about a Greek default and
governments’ ability to bail-out their lenders, wrote analyst
 Kian Abouhossein , at JPMorgan Cazenove.  RBS took a 1.82 billion-pound ($2.93 billion) provision for
its non-defaulted commercial real-estate loans under the EBA’s
adverse scenario for 2011, compared with an actual provision of
482 million pounds for 2010. Lloyds recorded provisions for non-
defaulted commercial real estate loans of 338 million euros for
2011 in the tests, compared with 297 million euros for 2010.  Barclays had 8.8 billion euros of Spanish government debt,
according to its statement, the most among British banks.  The price of sovereign debt held for the sale by the banks
in such countries as  Greece , Portugal and Ireland wasn’t
discounted as much as bonds for sale in the market, Willis said.  “If you look at the level bonds are trading at for Greece,
Portugal and Ireland, there’s quite a marked difference between
those levels and the mark-down that’s coming from the available-
for-sale book,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
