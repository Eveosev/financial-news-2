Kernel Holding SA (KER) , the largest
sunflower-oil producer in Ukraine, fell the most in almost two
weeks as ING Groep NV recommended selling the stock, citing the
prospect for lower commodity prices and regulatory changes.  Kernel declined as much as 3.6 percent to 71.55 zloty, the
steepest intraday drop since July 5. The shares traded 2.3
percent lower at 72.5 zloty at 10:09 a.m. in Warsaw, while the
benchmark WIG20 Index lost 1.3 percent.  ING rated the Kiev-based company “sell” in new coverage,
setting its price estimate for the stock at 64 zloty, according
to a research note dated July 15.  “Kernel’s fundamentals are weakening,” Dorota Puchlew and
Adam Milewicz, Warsaw-based analysts at ING, wrote in the note.
“The soft commodity cycle peak is approaching.”  Wheat futures declined for a third straight day on
speculation demand for U.S. supplies may wane as importers
switch to cheaper exports from  Russia . September-delivery wheat
slumped as much as 2.1 percent to $6.80 a bushel on the Chicago
Board of Trade.  Kernel, whose market value stands at 5.3 billion zloty
($1.8 billion), is the biggest agriculture stock traded on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange . ViOil Holding SA, a Ukrainian producer of
sunflower oil with about 4 percent of the world market, and
Valinor Public Limited, a Russian agriculture producer,
postponed their Warsaw initial public offerings last week,
citing worsening market conditions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
