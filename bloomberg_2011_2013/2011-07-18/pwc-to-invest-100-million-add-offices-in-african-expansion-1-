PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
accountancy firm, plans to spend $100 million over three years
on expanding its operations in  Africa , said Dennis Nally,
chairman of PwC International Ltd.  “This confidence is supported by our African CEO survey
which shows that 69 percent of CEOs in Africa are very confident
of revenue growth over the next three years, compared to 51
percent of CEOs globally,” Nally told reporters today in the
Kenyan capital, Nairobi. The company plans to double its African
staff in the next five years by adding 8,000 employees, he said.  PwC currently has operations in 31 African nations and will
add offices in  Ethiopia ,  Southern Sudan  and Burundi, said Philip
Kinisu, a senior partner for central Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
