CVC Capital Partners Ltd. is near an
agreement to buy ConvergEx Inc., a trading-software company
partly owned by  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) , said two people
with knowledge of the situation.  A deal valued at about $1.9 billion may be announced as
soon as this week, said one of the people, who declined to be
identified because the matter is private. ConvergEx, based in
New York, had also been considering an initial public offering
and in May filed to raise as much as $400 million.  ConvergEx was formed in the 2006 merger of a section of
Bank of New York’s securities unit with Eze Castle Software.
Bank of New York holds about one-third of the company, as does
GTCR Golder Rauner LLC, the Chicago-based private equity firm.
The company’s management team and directors hold the remaining
ownership stakes.  Spokesmen for Bank of  New York , GTCR and London-based CVC
declined to comment. A ConvergEx spokeswoman also declined to
comment.  ConvergEx had revenue of $610 million in 2010 and earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding
certain items, of $162 million. The company sells software to
handle trading and risk management, and also functions as a
broker-dealer. Most of the world’s biggest hedge and mutual
funds are customers, as are the 10 largest investment banks,
ConvergEx said in its May regulatory filing.  The company’s biggest competitors include Bloomberg LP,
parent of Bloomberg News, and SunGard Data Systems Inc.,
ConvergEx said in the filing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
