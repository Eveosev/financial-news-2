China ’s benchmark money-market rate
climbed on speculation the central bank will sell more bills to
drain cash from the financial system and contain inflation.  The People’s Bank of China issued 62 billion yuan ($9.6
billion) of bills last week, the most since the five days
through May 13, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A total
of 50 billion yuan of central bank bills and  repurchase
agreements  will mature this week, less than half of the 125
billion yuan last week, according to Guo Caomin, a bond analyst
at Industrial Bank Co. in Shanghai.  “As less bills mature this week, the PBOC’s increased bill
sales may have a bigger impact on cash supply and demand,” said
Guo.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, gained 40 basis points to 4.53 percent as
of the 4:30 p.m. close in  Shanghai , according to a weighted
average rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  The one-year interest-rate swap contract, the fixed cost
needed to receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate,
climbed three basis points to 3.87 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Sandy Hendry, Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
