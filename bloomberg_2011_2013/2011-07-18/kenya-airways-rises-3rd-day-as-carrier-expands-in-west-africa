Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL)  advanced for a
third day as sub-Saharan Africa’s third-biggest airline
increases its flight network in West Africa.  The stock rose 0.25 shilling, or 0.7 percent, to 34.50
shillings as of the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi.  The airline began flights to Ouagadougou, the capital of
 Burkina Faso , the company said in a statement dated July 15 and
published on Bloomberg today. Benin and Burkina Faso have also
granted Kenya Airways permission to pick up and drop off
passengers in flights between Cotonou, Benin and Ouagadougou,
Burkina Faso, the statement said.  “This is an important development for Kenya Airways as it
offers further consolidation of our expanding African network
and brings us closer to achieving our ambition of being the
carrier of choice for  Africa ,” Titus Naikuni, the company’s
chief executive officer, said in the statement.  The airline plans to start serving six new destinations by
the end of the financial year, the statement said.  “The introduction of a new route will help the airline
consolidate its position in west and central Africa, which has
some of the most profitable routes operated by Kenya Airways,”.
