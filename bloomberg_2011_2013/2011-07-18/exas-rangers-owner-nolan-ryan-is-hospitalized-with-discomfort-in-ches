Texas  Rangers owner  Nolan Ryan 
likely will be released soon from a Houston hospital after
experiencing discomfort from a recurring heart condition,
the team said.  Ryan, 64, was hospitalized after not feeling well two
days ago at his home in Georgetown, Texas, the Rangers said
in an e-mailed statement.  The Hall of Fame pitcher spent time in a hospital with
chest pains in October 2000, six months after he had
emergency double-bypass surgery. The Rangers said Ryan
underwent medical tests yesterday that indicated “no new
developments” with his heart condition.  Ryan is improving and his condition will continue to
be treated with medication, the team said.  Ryan’s controlling interest in the Rangers was
approved by Major League Baseball owners in May. He and
 Chuck Greenberg  headed an investment group that won a
bankruptcy auction in August 2010 to buy the Rangers for
$593 million. Greenberg left the team in March, saying he
and Ryan have “somewhat different styles.”  Inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999, Ryan
played 27 major league seasons from 1966 to 1993, with a
324-292 record. His 5,714 strikeouts and seven no-hitters
are both records.  To contact the reporter on this story:
