ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (PSM) , a German
broadcaster controlled by KKR & Co. and Permira Advisers LLP,
said it will boost interest paid to lenders who agree to extend
the maturity of some of its debt to 2016.  The company asked lenders to approve a new term loan D
maturing in July 2016 paying interest of 250 basis points more
than the euro interbank offered rate, compared with margins of
150 basis points and 187.5 basis points on existing term loans,
three people with knowledge of the plan said.  “A significant number of the largest lenders” support the
changes and are expected to grant their approval by Aug. 5, the
company said in a letter sent to investors today. The amendment
will ease a future refinancing that may include bonds, said the
people, who didn’t want to be identified before it’s approved.  ProSiebenSat.1 plans to repay as much as 1.2 billion euros
($1.7 billion) of senior loans after selling its Dutch and
Belgian cable assets in April. “The proposed amendments will
result in a significant immediate reduction of our term debt and
interest expense,” Axel Salzmann, the company’s chief financial
officer, said in the letter.  Lenders that agree to the changes will be paid consent fees
of as much as 30 basis points, the people said. Deutsche Bank AG
and UniCredit SpA are coordinating the request, according to the
letter today. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Katrin Schneider, a spokeswoman for ProSiebenSat.1,
declined to comment.  Unterfoehring, Germany-based ProSiebenSat.1 expects net
debt to remain at between 1.5 to 2.5 times its earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization by the end of 2011,
according to the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
