Eco Sustainable Solutions Ltd., a
U.K. waste recycler, gained planning permission for a 12 million
pound ($19 million) biomass plant, the first in Dorset.  Construction will begin by November and the facility will
be commissioned by early 2013, Managing Director Trelawney
Dampney said today. The 3-megawatt plant will provide power for
5,000 homes, Eco said in a statement on its website, using waste
wood from its recycling business as feedstock. About 7-megawatts
of heat will dry wood for the companyâ€™s animal bedding business.  European Union targets have committed the U.K. to derive 15
percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. According
to the Department for Energy and  Climate Change , at least 30
percent of the figure could be met by biomass. Dorset council
took four years to approve planning permission, Dampney said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
