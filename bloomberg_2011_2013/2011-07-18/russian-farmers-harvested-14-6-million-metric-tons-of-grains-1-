Russian farmers harvested 14.6
million metric tons of grain as of today, the country’s
 Agriculture Ministry  said.  More than 3.9 million hectares (9.6 million acres) were
harvested, the ministry said in a statement on its website
today. It didn’t provide a year-earlier comparison.  The wheat crop reached 8.4 million tons, with yields
averaging 3.71 tons a hectare, the ministry said. The barley
harvest was 1.7 million tons, at 4.01 tons a hectare, according
to the statement. The numbers are in so-called bunker weight,
measured before the grain is dried and cleaned.  As of July 20 last year, 7.5 million hectares of grain
plantings were reaped and 21 million tons of grain had been
harvested. The yield averaged 2.81 tons a hectare last year,
according to the ministry.  The ministry targeted a 2011 grain harvest of 85 million
tons. The crop may reach 90 million tons this year, First Deputy
Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
