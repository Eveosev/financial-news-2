Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , Societe Generale SA and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  may
face pressure from investors to boost capital after scraping
through  Europe ’s banking stress tests.  Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest bank, had a core Tier 1
capital ratio of 6.5 percent under the test’s adverse scenario.
While that surpassed the 5 percent fail rate, it ranked eighth
among the 12 German banks that participated and 57th overall
among the 90 banks tested. Edinburgh-based RBS had a ratio of
6.3 percent, Societe Generale of Paris 6.6 percent and Milan-
based UniCredit 6.7 percent.  The European Banking Authority’s tests, which gave a
passing grade to all but eight participants, have been
criticized for not including the impact of a potential Greek
sovereign default, even though credit default swaps indicate
investors see an almost 90 percent chance one will occur. Bond
yields jumped to a euro-era record in  Spain  and  Italy  yesterday,
a sign the debt crisis is widening beyond  Greece , Ireland and
Portugal, the three nations that received bailouts.  “Since the stress tests did not include any sovereign debt
failure, some view them as not being stringent enough,” said
Espen Furnes, an Oslo-based  fund manager  at Storebrand Asset
Management, which oversees $74 billion. “If we see sovereign
defaults, many of the large banks like Deutsche, SocGen and RBS
will need new capital. These banks should strengthen their
capital base to curb investor worries.”  Shares Slump  Deutsche Bank,  Societe Generale (GLE)  and UniCredit said their
 capital ratios  would have been higher had regulators recognized
all the steps they were taking to increase reserves.  European bank shares rose, rebounding from the biggest drop
in 11 months that sent the Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial
Services Index to a two-year low yesterday. Societe Generale
rose 4 percent by 10:38 a.m. in Paris trading, after plunging
5.5 percent yesterday. RBS gained 2.6 percent, Deutsche Bank
advanced 3.1 percent, and UniCredit climbed 4 percent.  The eight banks that failed the tests had a combined
capital shortfall of 2.5 billion euros ($3.5 billion), the
London-based EBA said on July 15. Investors expected as many as
15 banks would fail and be required to raise 29 billion euros,
according to a survey by New York-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
last month.  JPMorgan Cazenove analysts led by Kian Abouhossein said in
a note after the test that as many as 20 banks may need to raise
as much as 80 billion euros of additional capital to help allay
investor concern over a Greek default.  Regaining Confidence  “The EBA tests give a lot of transparency and it looks
like some of the banks, even if they did pass the 5 percent
capital ratio minimum level, will likely need to boost their
capital to regain market confidence and investors’ trust,” said
Jonathan Fayman, a fund manager at BlueBay Asset Management Plc
in  London , which oversees about $43 billion.  The failures were Greece’s  EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB)  and
Agricultural Bank of Greece SA, Austria’s Oesterreichische
Volksbanken AG and Spain’s  Banco Pastor SA (PAS) , Caja de Ahorros del
Mediterraneo, Banco Grupo Caja3, CatalunyaCaixa and Unnim. As
many as 16 more will need to bolster capital after their core
Tier 1 ratio dropped below 6 percent, the EBA said.  An additional 17 banks had ratios below 7 percent, which
will be the minimum level under new rules from the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision that take full effect in 2019.  By comparison, 18 lenders had Tier 1 capital ratios above
10 percent under the harshest scenario, including Danske Bank
A/S, Denmark’s largest lender, and Germany’s Landesbank Berlin.  Risk-Weighted Assets  Deutsche Bank said on July 15 that the stress tests failed
to reflect the bank’s plans to reduce risk-weighted assets and
retain earnings, as well as the “sound economic environment”
in  Germany . The company plans to reach a target for a core Tier
1 ratio above 8 percent by 2013 under Basel III rules. A
spokesman declined further comment.  By reducing risk-weighted assets, a bank can bolster its
capital ratio.  “I don’t expect Deutsche Bank to make a capital
increase,” said  Konrad Becker , a Munich-based analyst at Merck
Finck & Co. “You have to look at the reason for the 6.5 percent
ratio and it is not because of sovereign risk. It is mainly
because of risk-weighted assets linked to derivatives and other
assets.”  Chief Executive Officer  Josef Ackermann , 63, told reporters
in Cernobbio, Italy, in April that the company is “well
capitalized.” The Frankfurt-based bank raised 10.2 billion
euros last October in its biggest-ever share sale to finance a
bid for a controlling stake in Deutsche Postbank AG and meet
stricter capital rules for banks.  ‘Relatively Harsh’  Societe Generale, led by CEO Frederic Oudea, 48, would have
had a core Tier 1 ratio of 7.5 percent under the adverse
scenario had the tests taken into account its first-quarter
results, an option to pay dividends in shares, the annual
capital increase reserved to employees and the reduction of
capital allocated to risky assets, according to a statement on
July 15. The bank reiterated that the ratio will climb to at
least 9 percent in 2013 under Basel III. Spokeswoman Laetitia Maurel declined to comment.  Berenberg Bank analysts including Nick Anderson said in a
note yesterday that the EBA’s methodology was “relatively
harsh” on RBS as it assumed a static balance sheet after 2010,
ignoring the bank’s plans to sell holdings including its
insurance unit to reduce assets by a further 10 percent by the
end of 2012.  RBS spokesman Michael Strachan declined to comment. The
bank, run by  Stephen Hester , 50, since November 2008, required a
government rescue after piling up the most losses of any
European bank during the financial crisis, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Not Properly Understood’  “The bottom line is that the role of capital in a bank is
not properly understood, putting pressure on banks to hold more
capital rather than less in the future,” the Berenberg analysts
said in the note. “The debate is now in the hands of
politicians, the media and the markets, all now armed with
stress test data.”  UniCredit, Italy’s largest bank, said on July 15 that the
stress test didn’t take into account the effect of convertible
bonds that would boost the core Tier 1 ratio to 7.2 percent
under the adverse scenario. A spokesman for UniCredit declined
further comment.  The bank, led by CEO Federico Ghizzoni, is the only one of
the country’s biggest lenders that hasn’t raised capital this
year.  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) , Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA, Unione
di Banche Italiane ScpA and  Banco Popolare SC (BP)  asked investors
for a total of 10.5 billion euros before the stress tests. All
the banks tumbled in Milan trading yesterday on concern the
sovereign debt crisis is infecting Italy.  ‘Thinly Capitalized’  Ghizzoni, 55, told reporters in Vienna in June that the
bank would decide on a share sale to boost reserves once it
knows how potential rules imposing a capital buffer on the
world’s biggest banks will affect UniCredit. It did raise 7
billion euros in the last three years through two offerings of
securities.  Bank of Italy Governor Mario Draghi said on July 13 that
Italian banks have raised about half of the 40 billion euros
required by the Basel rules. In June, analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg said Milan-based UniCredit needs to raise 6 billion
euros to meet regulators’ stricter capital requirements.  “The stress tests conducted showed that although only
eight banks failed, several of the larger European banks are
thinly capitalized,” said Furnes at Storebrand Asset
Management.  To contact the reporter on this story:
