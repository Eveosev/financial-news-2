Bosnia,  Croatia  and Serbia agreed to
apply together for European Union aid to finance joint
infrastructure projects as the former Balkan foes reconcile
their differences on the path to joining the bloc.  The three countries, which emerged from the civil war that
tore apart  Yugoslavia  in the 1990s, need to “focus on
infrastructure development” and set up an “inter-governmental
body to harmonize activities” related to infrastructure
development, their presidents said today in a joint statement.  The Balkans are struggling to kick start their economies
after the worst recession since the fall of communism halted
capital inflows and investments. Western Balkan countries need
to prove they can work together as regional cooperation is one
of the key requirements on their way toward EU membership.  Serbia  plans to win EU candidacy by the end of the year,
while Croatia, which wrapped up talks on June 30, hopes to join
the 27-member bloc in mid-2013. Bosnia, scene of the worst
carnage during the disintegration of Yugoslavia, has signed an
EU trade agreement.  Joint infrastructure would help bolster “good-neighborly
relations”, improve the economic competitiveness of the three
countries and create links with Adriatic ports, according to a
statement issued by the office of the Serbian President Boris Tadic.  The presidents of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia, who met today
in the Croatian Brijuni islands, once the summer residence of
former Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito who died in 1980, urged
their governments to plan “a regional network of highways, rail
links, logistics centers and the development of ports along the
Adriatic coast and the Sava and Danube rivers.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
