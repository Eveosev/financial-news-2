Egan-Jones Ratings Co. cut its
rating on the U.S. by one step to AA+ from AAA, citing the high
level of debt outstanding relative to other countries and
concern that politicians may fail to reduce spending.  “The major factor driving  credit quality  is the relatively
high level of debt and the difficulty in significantly cutting
spending,” the firm said July 16 in a report. Egan-Jones placed
the U.S. on negative watch on March 1.  Republicans are using talks to increase the $14.3 trillion
debt-ceiling to press for cuts in spending. Treasury Secretary
 Timothy F. Geithner  has said the government, which reached its
borrowing limit on May 16, will run out of options to prevent a
default on Aug. 2. The most likely outcome of the negotiations
is that the federal government will fail to reduce its debt to
gross domestic product “in any sort of meaningful fashion,”
said  Sean Egan , president of Egan-Jones in Haverford,
 Pennsylvania .  “We’ll muddle along, we won’t decrease the debt to GDP,”
Egan said today on Bloomberg Television’s “Street Smart” with
Carol Massar. “Then we’ll be faced with the crushing blow of
the baby boomers retiring.”  Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s have put
the U.S. debt rating on review for downgrade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
