NKT Holding A/S, a Danish industrial
group, won a 600 million-kroner ($113 million) contract to
supply cables for an Irish Sea wind farm built by Dong Energy
A/S and a unit of Iberdrola Renovables SA.  NKT Cables Group GmbH, a Cologne-based subsidiary, will
supply high-voltage cables to the  West of Duddon Sands  offshore
wind farm, 14 kilometers (9 miles) from Barrow-in-Furness in
northern  England , it said today in a statement.  Dong, a utility based in Skaerbaek,  Denmark , and
Iberdrolaâ€™s Glasgow-based ScottishPower Renewables unit are
building the 389-megawatt wind project, which will produce
enough power for about 300,000 homes starting in 2014, NKT said.  The contract includes delivery and installation of the on-
and offshore cables in 2013, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
