UT Bank Ltd. (UTB)  of  Ghana  advanced to
the highest in more than a year as investors bought shares on
speculation that profit increased in the first half.  The stock gained 2 pesewas, or 6.1 percent, to 35 pesewas
as of 3 p.m. in the capital, Accra, the highest since June 2,
2010. The stock last moved on July 5, when it lost 2.9 percent.  The share-price jump occured “in anticipation of good
earnings for the first half,” Randy Mensah, a stock trader at
Accra-based  Databank Financial Services Ltd. , said in a
telephone interview today. “We expect between 20 percent and 30
percent growth in UT Bank’s first-half profit over the previous
year’s half.”  In the first quarter through March, net income increased to
1.1 million cedis ($730,000) from 152,000 cedis a year earlier,
the bank said April 29.  Net interest income rose to 8.8 million
cedis from 5.4 million cedis.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
