India’s rupee weakened for a second
day as  Europe ’s worsening debt crisis spurred demand for the
perceived safety of the dollar over emerging-market assets.  The currency added to last week’s biggest loss in two
months as the MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index fell. The
rupee also declined on concern accelerating inflation will
prompt overseas investors to cut holdings of the nation’s stocks
and bonds.  “There is no clarity on whether foreign fund inflows will
continue as the overall environment isn’t positive,” said  Roy Paul , a deputy general manager at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.
“Europe is a concern on the global front and domestically
inflation still stays a worry.”  The rupee slipped 0.1 percent to 44.58 per dollar at the 5
p.m. close in Mumbai after falling 0.4 percent last week, the
biggest drop since the period ended May 6, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against
those of six major trading partners, rose 0.6 percent as
European leaders prepare to hold a special summit on July 21 in
an effort to stop the region’s financial crisis from spreading.  India ’s wholesale-price index rose 9.44 percent in June
from a year earlier, compared with 9.06 percent in May, a
government report showed on July 14.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.13 in
three months, compared with expectations of 45.05 at the end of
last week. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
