Fortuna Entertainment Group NV (FORTUNA) ,
the Czech betting company that sold shares last year, said it
expects to gain 30 percent of the market within two years with
a new lottery game that started today.  “We aim to win 30 percent of the market share in the
short term and become the leader in the long run,” Chief
Executive Officer Jiri Bunda said at the press conference in
Prague today. “There’s room for only two strong competitors:
Fortuna and Sazka.”  Fortuna is trying to lure clients away from Sazka AS, the
operator of the Czech state lottery that was declared bankrupt
by a court in May, with its Loto game. Offers by both Fortuna
and its majority owner, Penta Investments Ltd., to take over
Sazka before the court declaration were rejected by
shareholders.  The  Czech Republic ’s total lottery market may return to
2008, 2009 levels of 7.5 billion koruna ($434.2 million) spent
on lottery tickets in 2012, Bunda said. Fortuna as a leader
aims to control more than 50 percent of the market share in
the long term, according to Bunda.  Fortuna currently operates 700 terminals and plans to
have 1,000 by the end of the week, it said at the press
conference. The company, which signed an agreement with
Intralot SA to supply lottery terminals, plans to have between
3,000 to 3,500 units operating in the country in the long
term, it said at the press conference.  Fortuna fell 0.7 koruna, or 0.6 percent, to 118.3 koruna
as of 1:48 p.m. in  Prague .  Established in 1990 in Prague, Fortuna was taken over by
Penta, which also added a Polish betting company to the brand.
The company, which first sold shares in October, operates in
the Czech Republic,  Hungary , Slovakia and  Poland .  To contact the reporter on this story:
