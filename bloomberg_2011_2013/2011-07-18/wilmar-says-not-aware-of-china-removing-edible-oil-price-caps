  Wilmar International Ltd. (WIL) , which
accounted for about half of  China ’s retail cooking oil market,
said the company is not aware of the government lifting price
caps on the products.  China removed price limits on edible oils, the Quanzhou
Evening News reported, citing an unidentified official from the
price department of the National Development and Reform
Commission. A call to the office of NDRC Deputy Secretary
General Li Pumin today wasn’t answered.  “Not that we are aware of,” said a spokesman for the
Singapore-based company when asked if China had removed price
controls. He declined to be identified by name, citing corporate
policy. Wilmar is “monitoring the situation,” he said.  China told suppliers to cap prices in November to tackle
inflation, which has since reached the fastest pace in three
years. The government will seek to re-impose some controls
should price swings accelerate, the Chinese newspaper reported
yesterday, without elaborating on what measures might be taken.  Inflation in China has breached the government’s 4 percent
ceiling every month this year, with consumer prices rising 6.4
percent in June from a year earlier. Pork prices rose 57 percent
and accounted for more than a fifth of June’s inflation rate.  -- With assistance from Zhe Huang in Beijing. Editors:  Richard
