Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater
Associates LP, said he expects “another very difficult period”
for financial markets next year or in early 2013 as governments
struggle to reduce their debt, the  New Yorker  reported, citing
an interview with the hedge-fund manager.  The U.S. will eventually print more money to devalue its
currency, which would hurt its bond markets, Dalio said,
according to the New Yorker. Countries in the euro zone don’t
have that option and will undergo “classic depressions,” he
said, according to the magazine.  Dalio told the magazine  Greece ’s deal to avoid an immediate
default didn’t change his view.  “People concentrate on the particular thing of the moment,
and they forget the larger underlying forces,” he was quoted as
saying. “That’s what got us into the debt crisis. It’s just
today, today.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
