Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses as of 3 p.m. close.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, fell 19.71 points, or 0.7 percent, to
2,796.98. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  declined 0.9 percent to 3,095.13.  Auto stocks: SAIC Motor Corp. (600104 CH), China’s largest
carmaker, lost 2 percent to 18.03 yuan. FAW Car Co. (000800 CH),
which makes passenger cars in China with Volkswagen AG, slid 2
percent to 14.31 yuan.  The rebound in Chinese auto stocks may falter because more
local governments may introduce measures to limit car purchases,
according to Sinolink Securities Co. Auto stocks don’t have
“momentum” for further gains given the “sizeable” rebound
they have made, Wu Wenzhao, an analyst at Sinolink Securities,
wrote in a report today. The policy uncertainty the  auto
industry  is facing is increasing after the southwest city of
Guiyang in Guizhou province introduced purchase restrictions,
according to the report.  Coal producers: Kailuan Energy Chemical Co. (600997 CH)
jumped 3.7 percent to 17.49 yuan. Jizhong Energy Resources Co.
(000937 CH) advanced 2 percent to 27.59 yuan. Both companies are
based in China’s north Hebei province.  Hebei plans to consolidate the 340 coal companies in the
region into 50 companies or less by the end of 2015, Shanghai
Securities News reported today, citing a document from the local
government.  Developers: China Vanke Co. (000002 CH), the nation’s
biggest listed property developer, rose 1.6 percent to 8.49
yuan. Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048 CH), the second
largest, gained 2.9 percent to 10.99 yuan.  Some Chinese areas have stopped or eased government
measures to limit property purchases on concerns a fast decline
in home transactions would impact economic growth, Xinhua News
Agency reported yesterday, without saying where it obtained the
information.  China Merchants Bank Co. (600036 CH), the nation’s sixth-
largest lender, slid 1.4 percent to 12.80 yuan, the lowest close
since June 20. The bank said it plans to raise as much as 35
billion yuan ($5.4 billion) in a rights offer to shareholders in
China and  Hong Kong .  IRICO Display Devices Co. (600707 CH), a manufacturer of
television picture tubes, fell 6.2 percent to 12.79 yuan, the
third-biggest decliner on the Shanghai Composite today. The
company may report a loss of 70 million yuan for the first half
because of decreasing sales and product prices, IRICO Display
said in a statement late yesterday. It posted a profit of 11
million yuan for the first half of last year.       Jiangsu Yongding Co. (600105 CH), a manufacturer of optical
cable, jumped 4.7 percent to 12.74 yuan, the biggest gain since
May 31. The government will boost development of the
superconductor industry to reduce electricity loss on power-grid
transmissions, Wang Hua and Meng Yeyong, analysts at Shenyin &
Wanguo Securities Co., wrote in a report.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
