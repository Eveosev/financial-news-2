Environmental activists dressed in
polar bear outfits occupied the Edinburgh headquarters of  Cairn
Energy Plc (CNE)  to protest the oil company’s refusal to publish its
spill-response plans for deep-water drilling off Greenland.  About 60 Greenpeace volunteers were at the offices at 8:15
a.m. local time, Greenpeace campaigner Vicky Wyatt said. Cairn
said on June 6 that its oil spill-response plan, developed with
Greenland authorities, wasn’t available to the public.  “About 30 of them have locked themselves to various bits
of furniture and they will stay there until Cairn publish their
oil spill plan,” Wyatt said by telephone today.  Protesters have targeted the company’s exploration sites in
Greenland since it began drilling last year. Cairn started legal
action against Greenpeace in June.  Greenland’s waters may hold 50 billion barrels of crude oil
and gas, the  U.S. Geological Survey  estimates, enough to meet
 Europe ’s energy demand for almost two years.  “Wherever it is active, Cairn operates in a safe and
prudent manner,” Cairn said today in an e-mailed statement.
“Cairn takes its responsibilities such as oil spill contingency
and response plans very seriously.”  Cairn declined 15.9 pence, or 4.1 percent, to 371.5 pence
by the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , giving the company a market
value of 5.2 billion pounds ($8.3 billion).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
