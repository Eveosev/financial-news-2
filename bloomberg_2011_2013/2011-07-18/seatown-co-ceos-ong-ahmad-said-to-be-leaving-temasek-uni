Charles Ong and Nasser Ahmad are
quitting as co-chief executive officers of Seatown Holdings
Pte, the global investment company of  Singapore â€™s Temasek
Holdings Pte, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  Ong, who is also senior managing director of special
projects at Temasek, will continue in that role, said the
people, asking not to be identified because they are not
authorized to comment publicly before an announcement. Ahmad,
co-founder of DiMaio Ahmad Capital LLC, a New York-based
asset manager specializing in credit markets, will be
returning to  fund management , the people said.  Ong and Ahmad joined Seatown, set up in 2009, to help
build up the firm, the people said. Seatown, funded with more
than S$4 billion ($3.2 billion) from Temasek, has invested
about half of the capital in various assets worldwide, the
people said. Temasek managed S$193 billion as of March 31.  The  succession plan  is being completed, the people said.
Temasek said in an e-mailed statement it declined to comment.  DiMaio Ahmad, in which Morgan Stanley holds a minority
stake, registered DA Capital Asia Pte in Singapore, according
to the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, which
regulates businesses in the city-state. New York-based Morgan
Stanley bought a minority stake in DiMaio Ahmad in 2009.
Ahmad and Jack DiMaio started the investment firm in 2005.  The Wall Street Journal reported about their planned
departures earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
