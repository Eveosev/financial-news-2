The benchmark index for U.S. stock
options headed for its highest close in a month after European
banks failed stress tests and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
economists cut their forecasts for real U.S. economic growth.  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, increased 10 percent to 21.53 at 10:55 a.m. in
 New York . The index measures the cost of using options as
insurance against declines in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index,
which slipped 1.3 percent.  Europe ’s benchmark gauge of stock-
market volatility headed for the highest close since March.  U.S. banks led stocks lower, losing the most among 10
industry groups, after eight European lenders failed stress
tests last week, driving the region’s bank shares below the
value of their tangible assets for the first time in two years.
Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius cut their growth
forecasts to 1.5 percent in the second quarter and 2.5 percent
in the third quarter, down from 2 percent and 3.25 percent
respectively, according to a July 15 report.  August VIX futures climbed 4.6 percent to 21.10. The most-
active VIX options were August $24 calls. The VIX hasn’t closed
that high since  Japan ’s worst earthquake on record sent stocks
plunging worldwide four months ago.  Europe’s  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the cost of
protecting against a decline in shares on the Euro Stoxx 50
Index, jumped 11 percent to 31.10 in  Frankfurt  after earlier
rising as much as 12 percent. The index has climbed six of the
past seven days. The Euro Stoxx 50 fell 2 percent to 2,623.24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
