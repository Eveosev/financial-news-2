A second cargo of North Sea Forties
crude was deferred to August from July, boosting shipments for
next month to 18 lots, according to a revised loading schedule
obtained by Bloomberg News.  The deferred consignment is for parcel number F0720 and
will now load on Aug. 5 to Aug. 7, the plan showed.  The 600,000 barrel cargo will increase August Forties
exports to 348,387 barrels a day, according to Bloomberg
calculations based on loading programs. Last week, a shipment
was delayed to Aug. 7 to Aug. 9 from July 22 to July 24.  The revised July program comprises of 21 cargoes, compared
with the original plan of 18. In the past month, four shipments
have been deferred to this month from June, two cargoes were
added and one lot was dropped.  Output from the 200,000-barrel-a-day Buzzard platforms, the
biggest stream in the Forties blend, has been less than normal
in the past two months because of maintenance and technical
issues, according to  Nexen Inc. (NXY) , operator of the field.  Repair works are expected to be completed next month, Nexen
said on July 14 in a statement.  Forties is one of four North Sea crude grades used to price
Dated Brent, the benchmark for more than half of global oil. The
other blends are Brent, Ekofisk and Oseberg.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
