RTB Bor,  Serbia ’s only copper
miner and smelter, raised its copper output by more than a
third in the first six months and produced more gold and
silver.  The state-run company produced 14,000 tons of copper, or
34 percent more than a year ago, the company said in an e-
mailed statement. Gold and silver production increased 10
percent and 20 percent respectively, it said without
specifying quantities. RTB Bor produced 722 kilograms of gold
and 4.82 tons of silver in 2010.  “We expect the trend of rising production to continue
throughout the year,” RTB Bor spokeswoman Gorica Toncev-
Vailic said. The bigger output came as RTB Bor’s three mines
produced 5.7 million tons of ore in the six months, the most
in 10 years, she said.  RTB Bor, which also processes copper concentrate from
other sources, said its output included 36,300 tons of
sulphuric acid in the period.  Serbia failed three times to sell RTB Bor before deciding
to invest in it amid rising commodity prices. The company
broke even in 2010 for the first time after two decades of
losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
