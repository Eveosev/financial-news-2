Indian stocks dropped for a second
day, tracking losses in  Asia , as concerns about  Europe ’s debt
crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations toward raising
the U.S. debt ceiling dented investor sentiment.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) ,  India ’s biggest sports-utility
and tractor maker, lost 2.1 percent, leading declines among
automakers. European leaders will this week seek to revamp their
debt crisis-fighting strategy and end a deadlock that is
spooking investors and prompting warnings of contagion from the
 International Monetary Fund . U.S. President  Barack Obama  said
the government is “running out of time” in negotiating an
agreement to cut the fiscal deficit. Cipla Ltd., the nation’s
third-biggest drugmaker, retreated 2.2 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, slid
76.83, or 0.4 percent, to 18,485.09, according to preliminary
closing prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai, after swinging between
gains and losses at least 10 times. The measure has dropped 9.9
percent this year, the second-worst performer among key indexes
in the world’s 10 biggest markets, as the central bank raised
rates to cool inflation. Companies on the Sensex trade at 14.9
times estimated earnings, compared with 10.9 for the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index dropped 0.4 percent to 5,561.25 and
its July futures traded at 5,569.40. The BSE 200 Index decreased
0.2 percent to 2,303.03.  To contact the reporter on this story:
