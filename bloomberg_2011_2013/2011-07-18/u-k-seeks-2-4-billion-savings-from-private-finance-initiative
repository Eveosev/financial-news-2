The U.K. Treasury expects to save
1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) by trimming the operating
costs of public services provided by private companies.  The government is seeking to run its Private Finance
Initiative projects in  England  more efficiently by reducing
energy consumption, sub-letting unused  office space  and reducing
the frequency private companies clean windows or redecorate
buildings in order to achieve the savings, the Treasury said in
an e-mailed statement today.  “We have identified every opportunity to find savings,
tackling wasteful practice and gold plating in PFI contracts,”
Treasury minister James Sassoon said in the statement sent by
his office in London.  The government last week said that Britain has liabilities
of 40 billion pounds from PFI projects. The Treasury said
savings from its plan, which will be channeled back into public
services, would be achieved over the lifetime of all existing
PFI contracts that typically run for up to 30 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
