leaders won’t agree on a way to contain the region’s financial
problems at a meeting this week and as U.S. lawmakers fail to

an analyst at Northstar Commodity Investments LLC in

price since June 27, 2008. Prices are up 20 percent this year.  Gasoline for August delivery dropped 3.19 cents to settle
