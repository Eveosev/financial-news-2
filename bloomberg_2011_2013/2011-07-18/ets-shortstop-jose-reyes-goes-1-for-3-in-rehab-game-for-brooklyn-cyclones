The  New York Mets  said they expect
shortstop  Jose Reyes  to rejoin the team today after going 1-for-
3 with a double for the minor-league  Brooklyn Cyclones  in a
rehab game.  Manager Terry Collins said yesterday that Reyes, who missed
 Major League Baseball ’s All-Star Game because of a left
hamstring strain, should be back in the lineup tonight against
the  St. Louis Cardinals .  “As of now, obviously subject to change, it looks like
he’ll be ready to go tomorrow,” Collins told reporters before
the Mets’ game last night against the Florida Marlins.  Reyes doubled to left and scored a run yesterday in his
first visit to MCU Park along the Atlantic Ocean in Coney
Island, according to the team’s website.  “It was fun meeting the guys and being able to play on the
beach,” Reyes said. “Now I can say that I played at this
ballpark.”  Reyes was put on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to
July 3.  The 28-year-old is having among his best statistical
seasons, batting .354 with three home runs, 32 runs batted in,
15 triples and 30 stolen bases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
