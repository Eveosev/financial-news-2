The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of noon New York time.  The IGBC Index fell 0.5 percent to 13,068.52, while the
Colcap Index declined 0.4 percent to 1,577.97.  Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNEC)  , the Calgary-based  oil
company  with fields in  South America , fell 3.2 percent to 1,645
pesos, the lowest intraday level since it began trading a year
ago. Canadian stocks fell, led by energy and financial
companies, as bank stress tests failed to reassure investors the
European debt crisis will be contained and oil and natural-gas
futures dropped.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  , Colombia’s biggest oil company,
rose 0.1 percent to 3,580 pesos after saying it will offer up to
3 trillion pesos ($1.7 billion) worth of shares in a share sale
to begin July 27.  Chief Executive Officer  Javier Gutierrez  said the company
seeks to sell about a 2 percent stake, less than the 9.9 percent
stake allowed by law, according to an interview with the daily
Portafolio. The company plans to sell an additional stake in an
offering for foreign investors, Gutierrez told the daily.  “There was a lot of speculation as to the amount of the
offering, so Gutierrez has reassured the market,” said Juan David Pineros, an analyst at Interbolsa SA. “And the offering
is much less than the market was expecting.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
