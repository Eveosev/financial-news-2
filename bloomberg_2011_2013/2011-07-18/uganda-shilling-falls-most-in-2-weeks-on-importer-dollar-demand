Uganda ’s shilling weakened the most
in two weeks against the dollar amid demand for the U.S.
currency from domestic manufacturers who need foreign exchange
to pay for raw-material imports.  The currency of East Africa’s third-largest economy
depreciated 1.1 percent, heading for the biggest decline since
July 5, to 2,580 per dollar at 1:32 p.m. in Kampala, the
capital. It closed at 2,551.25 on July 15.  “We have seen a little bit of demand in the  interbank
market ,” Faisal Bukenya, a currency trader at the Ugandan unit
of Barclays Bank Plc, said by phone from Kampala. “They were
basically buying for their customers, especially in the
manufacturing sector and small amounts for the oil sector.”  The Ugandan shilling is the world’s third-worst performing
currency this year, after Suriname’s dollar and the Maldives
rufiyaa, according to Bloomberg Data. The currency has weakened
as inflation accelerated to a 17-year-high of 16 percent in May,
before slowing to 15.8 percent last month.  Uganda, East Africa’s third-biggest economy, is on the cusp
of an oil boom with Tullow Oil Plc, the U.K.-based energy
company, expected to start pumping crude and gas from the Lake
Albert Basin in 2012. The country has an estimated 2.5 billion
barrels of oil, with about 1 billion barrels in proven reserves,
according to Tullow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
