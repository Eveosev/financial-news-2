Fifty-seven players are still
competing for the  World Series of Poker  main-event champion’s
bracelet and an $8.7 million payday as the tournament heads into
its seventh day.  There were 91 competitors eliminated in the session that
began yesterday at the $10,000 buy-in Las Vegas tournament,
officially known as the No-Limit Hold’em World Championship.
Ryan Lenaghan of  New Orleans  is the leader with about 12.9
million in chips, followed by Ben Lamb of Tulsa,  Oklahoma , who
has just less than 10 million, according to the tournament
 website .  The event, which continues today at the Rio All-Suite Hotel
& Casino, is scheduled to play down to nine by tomorrow. Those
players will join the final table Nov. 5-7 to crown a champion.  After competing for 52 hours, the average stack of chips
for those remaining is 3.6 million. Among the survivors are
Australian Tony Hachem (2.3 million in chips), the brother of
2005 main-event champion Joe Hachem; poker professional Erick
Lindgren (2.2 million), who has more than $2.5 million in  World
Series  winnings; and Erika Moutinho of Easton,  Connecticut , the
last woman out of 242 that began the tournament. She has about
2.1 million in chips.  The main-event field of 6,865 players is the third-highest
for any live poker tournament, trailing the main events of 2006
(8,773 players) and 2010 (7,319).  To contact the reporter on this story:
