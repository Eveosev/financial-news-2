Ukraine and the European Union
seek to agree on the main points for a free-trade zone
agreement before the Eastern Partnership summit on Sept. 29,
the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said.  The talks on a free-trade zone with the EU have reached
their final stage, the Kiev-based ministry said in an e-mailed
statement today. All technical issues are to be tackled by
September.  “The free-trade zone agreement needs to be prepared as
soon as possible,” said EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht,
according to the statement. “The European side understands it
very well.”  De Gucht met Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kostyantyn
Hryshchenko in Brussels today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
