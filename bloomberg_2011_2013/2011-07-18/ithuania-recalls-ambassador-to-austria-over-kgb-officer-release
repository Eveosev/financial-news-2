Lithuania  recalled its ambassador to
Austria after the Alpine country released a former KGB officer
and a suspect in killings in Lithuania during the 1991
independence uprising.  Lithuania also sent a note of complaint, asking for
“convincing explanations” from Austria for releasing Mikhail
Golovatov, a suspect in crimes against humanity, the Vilnius-
based Foreign Ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.  Golovatov, a Russia citizen, was released less than 24
hours after detention in Vienna on July 14 on a European warrant
issued by Lithuania. The Baltic nation is seeking to try him for
civilian shootings that occurred shortly after it declared
independence from the  Soviet Union  in 1990.  The Austrian decision is “a gross violation of both
international and European Union law,” Parliamentary Speaker
Irena Degutiene said in a separate  statement  today. She rejected
 Austria ’s explanation of events that the Lithuanian warrant was
unclear and lacked information.  Some 50 protesters gathered by the Austrian embassy in
Vilnius today, chanting and holding banners such as “Shame on
You Austria” and “Why?”.  Golovatov was the leader of a special Soviet unit that
stormed a TV tower in Vilnius during anti-Soviet demonstrations.
Fourteen civilians died and over a thousand were injured in the
attack on the TV tower on Jan. 13, 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
