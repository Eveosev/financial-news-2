Hungarian investment-fund assets
fell a second month in June, the first two straight months of
losses since 2008, after the state took over privately managed
pension savings, an association of fund managers said.  The 471 funds represented by the association known as
 Bamosz  had a combined value of 3.8 trillion forint ($19.7
billion) at the end of June, 1.1 percent less than in May, the
Budapest-based group said in an e-mail. The last time assets
fell for more than one month in a row was in the three months
through November 2008, after Hungary received a bailout led by
the  International Monetary Fund .  Hungary, the European Union’s most-indebted eastern member,
adopted laws designed to drive funds from the mandatory private
pension system into the state budget to reduce public debt. The
pension funds managed 3 trillion forint of assets, including
bonds and shares, which were held both directly and via
investment funds, and which the state took over in June.  Investment funds shrank as the “continuing southern
European crisis put pressure on returns” and as institutional
and individual investors withdrew funds because of the pension
changes, Bamosz General Secretary Andras Temmel wrote in the e-
mailed statement.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
