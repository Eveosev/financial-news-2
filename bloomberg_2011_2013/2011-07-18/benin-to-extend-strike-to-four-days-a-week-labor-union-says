Unions representing state employees
in  Benin  said they will expand their industrial actions as of
tomorrow, striking for four days a week instead of three and
including teachers and nurses for the first time.  The decision came after President Boni Yayi said on July 14
that the government would use army personnel to replace striking
workers, Marcellin Bidossessi Sasse, secretary-general of the
countryâ€™s largest public sector labor union, told reporters on
July 16.  Workers are demanding a 25 percent pay increase backdated
to Jan. 1  To contact the reporter on this story:
