Niger , the world’s sixth-largest
uranium producer, plans to build a nuclear plant in cooperation
with other countries in West Africa, President  Mahamadou Issoufou  said.  Demand for electricity in Niger alone is not enough to make
the plant financially viable, he told journalists in the
capital, Niamey, yesterday. He didn’t give any details on when
or where the plant would be built, how big it would be or how
much it may cost.  To contact the reporter on this story:
