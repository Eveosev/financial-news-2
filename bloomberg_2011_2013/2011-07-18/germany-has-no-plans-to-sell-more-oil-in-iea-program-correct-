(Corrects percentage in second paragraph.)  Germany , having sold about 63
percent of its allocation of fuel reserves in an International
Energy Agency stock-release initiative, isn’t planning to offer
any more oil to the market, the nation’s stockpiles agency said.  The country’s Economy Ministry doesn’t view as necessary
the release of the remaining 37 percent, according to a
 statement  dated July 15 on the website of the
Erdoelbevorratungsverband, manager of the country’s stockpiles.
The German market is well supplied, the agency said.  Germany is one of 12 countries, which made oil stockpiles
available in the IEA program that was announced on June 23. The
nation was allocated 4.2 million barrels out of a total 60
million barrels.  No one from the German Economy Ministry was available to
comment when Bloomberg News called an office number in Berlin
three times today and three times on July 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
