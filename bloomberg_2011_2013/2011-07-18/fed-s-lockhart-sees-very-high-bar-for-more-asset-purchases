Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
President  Dennis Lockhart  said that with current Fed policy very
accommodative, a third round of asset purchases may not be
needed.  “I would never take any option off the table, but I do
think it’s a very high bar to implementation of another round,”
Lockhart said in an interview today on the Fox Business Network.
“I am really in a wait-and-see mode. I am not sure the returns
to further stimulus would be all that great.”  “The conditions we are facing now are not the conditions
we faced last November when it was implemented,” Lockhart said,
referring to the second round of $600 billion in bond purchases
that the central bank undertook to stave off falling prices and
improve growth. “At that time we were looking at the potential
for deflation in the economy,” he said.  Lockhart, 64, a former Georgetown University professor, has
led the Atlanta Fed since 2007. Fed presidents rotate voting on
monetary policy with Lockhart next voting in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
