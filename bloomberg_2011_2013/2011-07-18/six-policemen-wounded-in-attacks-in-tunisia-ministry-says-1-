Six Tunisian policemen were injured
when they exchanged fire with gunmen in Menzel Bourguiba, about
60 kilometers (37 miles) north of the capital city of Tunis on
July 16, the Interior Ministry said.  “Extremists” also set police stations and other public
property on fire in provinces across  Tunisia  in an attempt to
“undermine the climate of stability and security” that
prevailed after the lawlessness following the ouster of former
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali on Jan. 14, the ministry said
in a faxed statement late yesterday.  In a separate incident, a 14-year-old boy was shot dead
when police tried to disperse hundreds of protesters in the
central town of Sidi Bouzid, state-run Tunis Afrique Presse
reported today.  Tunisians have protested in several provinces since July
15, calling for the resignation of Interim Prime Minister Beji Caid Essebsi and for the exclusion of former regime officials
from the government. The authorities used tear gas to break up
the crowds.  “Extremist political parties” were trying to sabotage the
election for a Constituent Assembly planned for Oct. 23, the
ministry said.  Essebsi said today that the violence aims at derailing the
elections, which he vowed would be held on time.  “There is a conspiracy against Tunisia,” Essebsi told
reporters. He, too, blamed “extremist” forces. “They are
afraid of the elections and their results which will reveal
their real size,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
