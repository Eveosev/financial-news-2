The ruble fell against the dollar,
poised for its lowest close in almost a week, as concern the
euro area’s debt crisis will slow the global recovery curbed
demand for riskier emerging-market assets.  The currency was 0.3 percent weaker at 28.185 per dollar as
of 10:40 a.m. in Moscow, after declining 0.4 percent last week.
A close at that level would be the weakest since July 12. The
ruble was 0.3 percent stronger at 39.5725 per euro, leaving it
little changed at 33.3094 versus the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket.  European leaders hold a special summit this week after
eight of the region’s banks failed stress tests. Oil,  Russia ’s
chief export, traded down as much as 56 cents a barrel this
morning, while Urals crude, the country’s main export blend,
fell 0.1 percent at $117.03 a barrel.  “The Russian bourses are likely to retreat at the start of
the week in step with activity on core external markets,”
analysts at Johannesburg, South Africa-based Tradition Analytics
wrote in an e-mailed note.  Oil prices  have “come under pressure
amid a broader rotation towards safe assets as the risk-aversion
trend continues.”  Emerging-market assets have declined since last week as
investors bet the euro area’s crisis may spread to  Italy , the
region’s third-largest economy. Two-year bonds of Greece and
 Portugal , both of which have received bailouts, yield 30.3
percent and 17.6 percent respectively, compared with the 5.3
percent yield on similar-maturity Russian debt.  Russian  government bonds  rose for a fourth day, pushing the
yield on the ruble Eurobond due in 2018 down one basis point to
6.85 percent. Non-deliverable forwards, which provide a guide to
expectations of currency movements and allow companies to hedge
against them, show the ruble at 28.4575 per dollar in three
months, compared with 28.3363 on July 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
