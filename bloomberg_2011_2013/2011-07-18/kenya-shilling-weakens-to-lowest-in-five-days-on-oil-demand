Kenya ’s shilling depreciated to the
lowest against the dollar in five trading sessions as oil
importers sought to buy more crude following a decline in
prices.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy fell as much
as 0.3 percent to 90.00 per dollar and was trading 0.1 percent
lower at 89.85 at 10:50 a.m. in Nairobi. A close at this level
will be the lowest since July 12.  “The shilling has weakened due to increased demand for the
greenback from oil importers who anticipate to increase their
purchase of crude following the price drop,” Wilson Mutai, a
dealer at Nairobi-based African Banking Corp Ltd., said in a
phone interview today. The currency is expected to trade within
the 89.50 to 90.50 level in coming days, he added.  Brent crude  declined for a third day in  London  as investors
bet that Europe’s worsening debt crisis may slow the economy and
crimp fuel demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
