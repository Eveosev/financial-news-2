Israel  urged Colombiaâ€™s President
 Juan Manuel Santos  not to support a Palestinian state in a
letter from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, daily  El
Tiempo  reported.  The letter, which called on Colombia to back Israel in its
rejection of a United Nations resolution to recognize Palestine
statehood, was carried to Colombia by visiting Israeli
Infrastructure Minister Uzi Landau, the Bogota-based daily cited
him as saying. The UN may consider the resolution in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
