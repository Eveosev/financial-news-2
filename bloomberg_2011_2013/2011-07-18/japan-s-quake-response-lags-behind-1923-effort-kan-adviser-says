Japan ’s rebuilding is lagging behind
the nation’s responses to the Tokyo earthquake of 1923 and
Kobe’s 1995 disaster because of political infighting, the head
of the reconstruction committee said.  “The obstacle to reconstruction is politics,” Makoto
Iokibe, the chairman of the government-appointed panel, said in
a July 15 interview in his Tokyo office. “It’s absolutely
crazy,” Iokibe, 67, said.  The March 11 earthquake and tsunami that left more than
20,000 people dead or missing should be serving as a catalyst
for reinvigorating the world’s third-largest economy, according
to Iokibe. Instead, politicians are focused on the future of
embattled Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  rather than reconstruction,
the adviser said.  Kan, who faces calls to resign from opposition lawmakers
and also within his own party, has said that he will step down
once the crisis is contained. It includes power shortages and
the aftermath of the world’s worst nuclear accident since 1986.
Kan’s government will compile this month a basic reconstruction
plan based on suggestions by Iokibe’s committee.  Iokibe is a historian, professor emeritus at Kobe
University, and the president of the National Defence Academy,
which trains cadets for the defence force.  Three Days  Broad plans for rebuilding were proposed in three days
after the Great Kanto Earthquake, which destroyed  Tokyo  and
Yokohama in 1923, Iokibe said. Shinpei Goto, the home minister,
played a key role in those efforts. After the most recent
disaster, disruptions have included Ryu Matsumoto quitting a
week into his job as reconstruction minister.  According to Iokibe, the speed of the current response also
lags behind that after the Kobe quake.  Political wrangling saw Kan this month scale back a second
extra budget for rebuilding to 2 trillion yen ($25 billion),
only half the size of the first one. The government expects
restoring the country to cost as much as 12 trillion yen over
five years, including building solar and wind power stations,
the Asahi newspaper reported July 16, without saying where it
got the information.  In an additional complication, the government may run out
of money as early as October unless a bill authorizing bond
sales is passed before parliament closes at the end of August,
Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said July 5.  Raising Taxes  Established in April, Iokibe’s committee recommended last
month that Kan consider temporarily raising some taxes to pay
for rebuilding while avoiding adding to the world’s largest
public debt burden. Higher income tax and increases in some
smaller levies, such as for cigarettes, may be “the best mix,”
according to Iokibe. Sales-tax revenue may be needed to fund
social welfare costs rather than reconstruction.  Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara in an interview said Kan
has shown poor leadership and faulted the government for failing
to boost taxes to pay for reconstruction.  The approval rating for Kan’s cabinet fell to a record low
of 12.5 percent last week, a 9.4 percentage point drop from June,
according to a Jiji Press survey. About 70 percent of
respondents in an Asahi newspaper survey published on July 12
said Kan should step down by the end of August.  Japan’s economy, plagued by deflation, has grown less than
1 percent per year in the past decade.  Losing Its Edge  The economy is “losing competitive edge,” Iokibe said.
“If a frog is boiled slowly, it will be boiled until it’s dead
but if it gets some shocks before then, the frog will jump out
and save his life.”  The March 11 disaster can serve as the jolt that “awakens
a nation which is currently going downhill slowly,” he added.  Gross domestic product contracted for the two quarters
through March 31 and a rising yen threatens to restrain a
rebound from the disaster by eroding exporters’ profits. At the
same time, industrial output is bouncing back and the central
bank said July 12 that “economic activity is picking up with an
easing of the supply-side constraints caused by the earthquake
disaster.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
