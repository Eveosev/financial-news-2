Zimbabwe  Electric Supply Authority,
the southern African nation’s power utility, said it’s seeking
bidders for a $1.3 billion contract to expand three  power
plants .  The projects will boost Zimbabwe’s generating capacity by
900 megawatts, company spokesman Fullard Gwasira said by phone
from the capital, Harare, today. He declined to say when the
bidding process would end.  The expansion of the Hwange power station will add 600
megawatts to the grid, while two additional generating units at
the Kariba plant will add another 300 megawatts each, Gwasira
said. The design of the works is being done by Hatch Africa
Energy, a unit of Canada’s  Hatch , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
