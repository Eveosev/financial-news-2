Mauritius’s rupee depreciated for a
second day against the dollar as concern of the debt crisis in
Europe, the country’s main trading partner, curbed appetite for
riskier frontier markets.  The rupee depreciated 0.35 percent to 28.50 to the dollar
by 3 p.m. in  Port Louis , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The 38-member SEMDEX stocks gauge fell 0.4 percent to
2,053, its lowest level since May 5, led by the  Mauritius
Commercial Bank (MCB) , the country’s largest lender by market value,
and  New Mauritius Hotels Ltd. (NMH) , the biggest leisure operator.  “The rupee weakened because the euro lost ground on the
dollar,” said Oumesh Mungroo, treasurer at the Ebene-based
local unit Barclays Bank Plc, in a phone interview today.  The euro fell the most in a week against the dollar, on
concern that European leaders won’t agree on measures to contain
the region’s debt crisis at a summit this week. The rupee
closely tracks the euro’s movements against the dollar, with an
average correlation of 0.88 this month, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A value of 1 would mean that they move in
lock step.  Europe  is the Indian Ocean island nation’s biggest buyer of
exports and largest source of visitors, according to the  Central
Statistics Office .  Data from the Bank of Mauritius’ website show that the
average selling prices for dollars is 29.051 rupees compared
with 28.996 on July 15. Buying prices ranged from 27.5337 to
27.6982 rupees.  Versus the euro, the rupee gained as much as 1 percent, the
most since July 13, to 39.7695 and was trading 0.4 percent
stronger at 40.0152.  To contact the reporter on this story:
