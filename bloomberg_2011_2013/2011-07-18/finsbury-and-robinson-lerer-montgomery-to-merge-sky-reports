Public relations firm Finsbury Ltd.,
founded by Roland Rudd, is to merge with New York firm Robinson
Lerer & Montgomery LLC to form a new company called RLM
Finsbury, Sky News reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The combination of the two companies, both owned by WPP
Group Plc, will see Rudd become chairman, and Walter Montgomery,
a founder of Robinson Lerer & Montgomery, chief executive
officer, Sky said. The new company aims to open an office in
Honk Kong this year, Sky said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
