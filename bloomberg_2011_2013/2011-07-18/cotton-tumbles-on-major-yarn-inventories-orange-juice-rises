Cotton fell to a 10-month low as
escalating yarn supplies in  India , the world’s largest user
after China, signaled slowing global demand for textiles.  Orange
juice  gained.  Cotton-yarn inventories in India have “remained high,”
forcing mills to idle capacity, D.K. Nair, the secretary general
of the  Confederation of Indian Textile Industry , said by
telephone from  New Delhi . Prices in New York have plunged 56
percent since touching a record in March as demand dwindled.  “These guys are just sitting on major, major stockpiles of
yarn, and it’s caused the yarn market to plummet,” Chris Kramedjian, a risk-management consultant at FCStone Fibers &
Textiles in Nashville, Tennessee, said by telephone. “It’s a
pretty drastic situation.”  Cotton for December delivery fell 2.62 cents, or 2.6
percent, to settle at 96.84 a pound at 2:49 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in  New York . Earlier, the price tumbled by the 5-cent
exchange limit to 94.46 cents, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Sept. 16. The fiber reached a record of $2.197 on
March 7.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery gained 0.45
cent, or 0.2 percent, to settle at $1.978 a pound on ICE, after
touching $1.9885, the highest since March 22, 2007. The
commodity has gained 41 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
