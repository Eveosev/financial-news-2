Moh Siong Sim, a currency strategist
at Bank of Singapore Ltd., comments on the outlook for the
 Singapore dollar  in a telephone interview.  The bank predicts the currency will strengthen 1.6 percent
to S$1.20 per dollar by year-end and 2.4 percent to S$1.19 in 12
months. Government data today showed non-oil domestic exports
climbed 1.1 percent in June from a year earlier, compared with
the 3.8 percent pace estimated by economists in a Bloomberg
survey.  “The argument for a tighter policy stance has been
weakened by the fact that we have seen uncertainties in the
growth outlook and a peaking in the inflation picture,
especially with commodity and food prices coming off.”  The forecasts for the Singapore dollar “incorporate some
downside growth risks that will lead the Monetary Authority of
 Singapore  to keep the policy stance unchanged in October,” he
said. Bank of Singapore will review its estimate at the end of
the month, he said.  “I think the bigger driver from here onwards would be more
of the trend in the Chinese currency and the outlook of the euro.
The yuan would matter over a longer time horizon simply because
it’s appreciating against the dollar and is likely to do so. You
also could see a stronger euro once they manage to kick the can
down the road in terms of the debt problems.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
