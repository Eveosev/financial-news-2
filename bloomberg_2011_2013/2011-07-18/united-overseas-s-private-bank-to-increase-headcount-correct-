United Overseas Bank Ltd. (UOB) ,
Singapore’s smallest bank by market value, plans to increase the
number of private bankers it employs by fivefold in the next
five years.  The bank intends to expand headcount from 40 to about 200
people, Wilson Aw, executive director of UOB and head of its
private banking division, said in an interview in Singapore
today. The group aims to grow its private banking assets under
management to S$50 billion ($41 billion) to S$60 billion in that
timeframe, from “well above” S$10 billion now, he said.  Private banks in  Asia  have been adding to their headcount
as the region’s millionaires surpassed that of Europe. The
wealth of 3.3 million high net worth individuals in Asia-Pacific
climbed to $10.8 trillion last year, exceeding the $10.2
trillion held by 3.1 million people in  Europe , according to a
survey by Capgemini SA and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management.  United Overseas shares climbed 0.6 percent to S$19.74 as of
2:29 p.m. in Singapore trading, the highest since July 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
