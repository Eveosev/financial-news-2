The nation’s two largest public
pension systems reported returns topping 20 percent for the year
ended June 30, their best in more than a decade as the
California funds profited from stocks and private equity.  The  California Public Employees’ Retirement System , or
Calpers, the U.S.’s biggest pension, earned 20.7 percent in the
12 months ended June 30. It was the best result in 14 years, led
by gains in stocks and private equity. The California State
Teachers’ Retirement System, the second-largest, earned 23.1
percent, it said in a press release.  Stocks held by the first plan, which has $237.5 billion of
assets, returned 30.2 percent, fund administrators said today.
Fixed-income investments rose 7 percent. Real estate and private
equity, earned 10.2 percent and 25.3 percent through March,
respectively.  “Obviously the results are pleasing,” the Chief
Investment Officer  Joe Dear  told the governing board today at a
meeting in Petaluma, north of  San Francisco . “We are in the 20
percent club. It was a good year. We are back.”  The results may help Calpers parry concern that it relies
on overly optimistic return assumptions that hide the size of
its deficits. The fund lost almost a quarter of its value in
2009 as the global recession dragged down stock prices and real
estate values.  Even with the gain, the pension fund has earned 3.41
percent annually on average in the past five years, 5.36 percent
in the last 10 and 7.11 percent over 15 years. It has gained
8.38 percent annually over 20 years.  Spread Out  While the fund expects to earn 7.75 percent annually to
meet its obligations, it spreads out gains and losses over 15
years to smooth out potential spikes and dips in how much the
fund must ask from taxpayers each year to pay for employer
contributions for public-employee pension benefits.  Pensions such as Calpers have benefited from the stock
market’s rebound since March 2009, when the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index touched a 12-year low. The index was little changed in
the second quarter, after gaining 5.4 percent from January
through March. The gauge of U.S. equities climbed almost 13
percent last year and 23 percent in 2009.  The return by Calstrs, with $154.3 billion in assets, was
the highest since 1986.  Asset Mix  Calpers invests about 49 percent of assets in stocks, 20
percent in bonds, 14 percent in private equity, 10 percent in
real estate and 5 percent in inflation-linked assets such as
commodities. It tries to keep 2 percent in cash.  The fund gained 13.3 percent in fiscal 2010 after losing
23.4 percent in 2009, the biggest drop in the pension’s 79-year
history. It lost 4.9 percent in 2008 after a 19.1 percent climb
in 2007.  Calpers had assets of about $225 billion when  Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  went bankrupt in September 2008, leading
to a panic that wiped out more than $6 trillion in U.S. stock-
market value in about six months. Calpers value plummeted to
$164.7 billion by Jan. 31, 2009. It had reached $251 billion at
the end of June 2007, climbing to a record of about $260 billion
in October of that year, just before the global recession began.  The 13-member Calpers board in March voted to keep the
expected rate of return on assets at 7.75 percent. They rejected
a recommendation from actuaries to lower it to 7.5 percent,
which was based on projections for market returns to trail
historical averages.  Some board members expressed concern at the time that a
lower rate would have burdened local governments by forcing them
to put more cash into the fund as they were already facing
financial strains.  Once Fully Funded  Calpers in January said it had only about 70 percent of the
money it needs to cover benefits promised to government workers
when they retire. The pension was fully funded when the
recession began in December 2007.  Taken as a whole, 215 public pensions in the U.S. have 76.1
percent of the assets needed to meet projected obligations, on
average, according to a survey released in June by the National
Conference on Public Employee Retirement Systems in  Washington .  Calstrs averages its investment returns over three years to
determine how close its assets come to meeting anticipated
obligations to retirees. Because of a 25 percent loss in 2008-
09, the system’s three-year return is 0.98 percent, which lags
behind the 7.75 percent Calstrs has calculated it needs to meet
its long-term obligations to retirees, the press release said.  “Solid performance in the past two fiscal years puts some
wind in our sails, but it doesn’t make up for a lost decade of
returns,” Chief Investment Officer Christopher J. Ailman said
in the press release, referring to the 2000s.  The New York State Common  Retirement Fund , the third-
largest U.S. public pension plan with $146.5 billion, returned
an estimated 14.6 percent for the year ended March 31,
Comptroller  Thomas DiNapoli  said July 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
