Morgan Stanley (MS) , owner of the world’s
largest brokerage, is likely to appoint Ryosuke Tamakoshi to its
board as the second representative from  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc. (8306) , according to a person briefed on the discussions.  Tamakoshi, the former chairman of Mitsubishi UFJ, will
represent  Japan ’s biggest publicly traded bank along with
Masaaki Tanaka, who was elected to the board in May, said the
person, who declined to be named because the appointment hasn’t
been announced. Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for New York-
based Morgan Stanley, declined to comment.  Mitsubishi UFJ converted $7.8 billion of outstanding
convertible preferred stock in Morgan Stanley into common stock
last month. The move raised Mitsubishi UFJ’s stake in Morgan
Stanley to 22 percent and gave the bank a second board seat.  Tamakoshi, 64, was chairman of Mitsubishi UFJ when it took
a $9 billion stake in Morgan Stanley as the investment bank’s
shares plunged in the wake of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s
September 2008 collapse. Nobuyuki Hirano, deputy president of
Mitsubishi UFJ, served on Morgan Stanley’s board from March 2009
until he was replaced by Tanaka this year.  The Nikkei newspaper reported the likely appointment
earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
