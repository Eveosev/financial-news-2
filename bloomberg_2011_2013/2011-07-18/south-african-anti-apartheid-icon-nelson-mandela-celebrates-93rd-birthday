Anti-apartheid icon  Nelson Mandela ,
who was hospitalized for two days in January after contracting a
respiratory infection, celebrated his 93rd birthday today at his
home village in  South Africa ’s Eastern Cape Province.  Mandela spent 27 years in prison for plotting the violent
overthrow of segregationist rule and served for five years as
president following South Africa’s first all-race elections in
1994. After stepping down, he campaigned for children’s rights,
global peace and greater access to treatment for AIDS sufferers,
before retreating from public life.  Pictures of a smiling Mandela surrounded by his daughters
and grandchildren were posted on his  foundation’s website .
The government and the foundation called on all South Africans
to do 67 minutes of charity work today to commemorate the 67
years Mandela spent struggling for human rights and democracy.  Mandela “showed us that despite the divisive racial
oppression and hardships that this nation had gone through, it
is not only possible, but necessary to embrace one another and
to reconcile the South African people,” President  Jacob Zuma 
said in a birthday message, circulated via e-mail. “He laid the
foundation for a truly non-racial, non-sexist, democratic and
prosperous society.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
