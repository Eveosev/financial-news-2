The Women’s World Cup final between
 Japan  and the U.S. drew the largest big-market television rating
for a tournament game in 12 years and the second-highest in
history,  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN said.  Yesterday’s game, which Japan won 3-1 on penalty kicks
after the teams tied 2-2 in overtime in Frankfurt, was seen on
ESPN in an average of 8.6 percent of households in the top 56
U.S. television markets, Nate Smeltz, a spokesman for the
network, said in an e-mail.  The overnight rating is the highest since the 1999
tournament, which the U.S. hosted and won, and also the highest
in network history. The U.S. team’s 2-0 semifinal win over
 Brazil  in 1999 was watched by an average of 3.2 percent of U.S.
households on ESPN. Its shootout win over  China  in the final,
which was aired by ABC, drew a 13.3 overnight rating, according
to the Associated Press.  The U.S. win in this year’s quarterfinal over Brazil drew a
2.6 rating.  The end of the yesterday’s final, which came after Japan
twice rallied from one-goal deficits, also set a record by
generating 7,196 Twitter posts per second, the most for the 5-
year-old social media network, it said in a post of its own.  The British Open, which was won yesterday by Northern
Ireland’s Darren Clarke, drew a big-market rating of 2.6, airing
from 8 a.m.-2 p.m. New York time, also on ESPN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
