Chile ’s peso fell for a second day
after U.S. leaders failed to reach a deal to raise the debt
ceiling, fueling concern the world’s largest economy may default
and cutting demand for riskier emerging-market assets.  The peso weakened 0.2 percent to 462.57 per  U.S. dollar  at
2:07 p.m. New York time, from 461.57 on July 22. The currency
has strengthened 1.4 percent this year.  “Global  risk aversion  is rising again, fueled by concerns
of a default in  Washington ,” Katia Diaz, a Latin America
economist at 4Cast. Inc., said in a phone interview. “Most
global equities are down, which is also having a negative impact
on the peso.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index decreased 0.2 percent and
the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 0.4 percent. The benchmark
Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 0.3 percent as Greece’s credit
rating was cut three steps by Moody’s Investors Service, which
said the European Union’s rescue for the debt-laden nation will
cause substantial losses for investors and amount to a default.  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, added six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 5.63 percent.  Chile’s central bank paid an average of 462.70 pesos per
U.S. dollar for $50 million today as part of a $12 billion
effort to limit the peso’s gains, according to data posted on
its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
