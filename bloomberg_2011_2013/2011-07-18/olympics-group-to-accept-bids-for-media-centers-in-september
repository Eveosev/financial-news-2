(Correct organization managing Olympic Village in last
paragraph of story originally published yesterday.)  The company managing real estate
built for the  London  2012 Olympic Games will start accepting
bids for two media centers with a total of 91,600 square meters
(987,000 square feet) of space in September.  The  Olympic Park Legacy Company  aims to lease the
International Broadcast Centre, which is big enough to
accommodate five jumbo jets, to a “big, anchor tenant” within
six months, spokeswoman Victoria O’Byrne said by phone. The
29,500 square-meter Main Press Centre will be leased to smaller
companies, she said.  The properties in the northwest corner of the Olympic Park
will be large enough to accommodate 8,000 journalists at peak
times during the six-week event.  Parts of the Olympic Park and five permanent stadiums will
be sold off after the 9.3 billion-pound ($15 billion) event in
Stratford, east London, ends in August. Soccer team West Ham
United in March agreed to lease the Olympic Stadium following
the games and the Olympic Delivery Authority has put the 500
million-pound ($800 million) Olympic Village up for sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
