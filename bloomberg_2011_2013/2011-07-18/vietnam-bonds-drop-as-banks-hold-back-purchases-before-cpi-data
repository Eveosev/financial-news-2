Vietnam ’s bonds fell on speculation
banks are slowing down purchases of government debt ahead of
this month’s inflation data. The dong was stable.  The State Treasury sold 600 billion dong ($29.2 million) of
five-year bonds and 1.2 trillion dong of three-year notes on
July 14, according to statements on the Hanoi Stock Exchange’s
website. That is less than the 1.45 trillion dong of five-year
debt and 1.752 trillion dong of three-year securities sold at
the July 7 auction.  The  consumer price index  rose 20.82 percent in June from a
year ago, the fastest pace since November 2008. The General
Statistics Office often releases CPI data during the last week
of the month.  “Bond yields are steady, while showing some signs of
slight increase,” said Luu Hai Yen, a Hanoi-based analyst at
Thang Long Securities Joint-Stock Co. “Banks are holding off
from buying government debt while waiting for July CPI figures,
which will show a clearer signal on whether the economy has been
stabilized yet.”  The yield on the benchmark five-year note rose four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 12.48 percent, according to
a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong was little changed at 20,565 per dollar as of 2:50
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the reference rate at 20,608 today, unchanged
since July 11, according to its website. The currency is allowed
to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  --Diep Ngoc Pham in Hanoi. Editors: Sandy Hendry, Simon Harvey  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
