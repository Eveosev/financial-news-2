Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN)  said second-
quarter profit more than doubled, beating analysts’ estimates as
the owner of the Wynn and Encore casinos expanded in  China  and
benefited from a recovery in  Las Vegas .  Net income climbed to $122 million, or 97 cents a share,
from $52.4 million, or 42 cents, a year ago, Las Vegas-based
Wynn said today in a statement. Profit excluding some items was
$1.60, beating the $1.03 average of 23 analysts’ estimates.  Macau is booming while Las Vegas recovers from its steepest
gambling and convention decline. Wynn opened Encore Macau in
April 2010, doubling its presence in the world’s biggest
gambling market, where casino betting surged 58 percent last
year and 45 percent in the six months ended June 30.  Second-quarter  cash flow , measured as adjusted property
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
jumped 59 percent to $447 million, beating the $353.7 million
analysts estimated. Ebitda for Macau climbed 45 percent to
$314.3 million and for Las Vegas, the biggest U.S. casino city,
doubled to $132.7 million.  Wynn rose $2.27 percent to $164.89 at 4:30 p.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Wynn Macau Ltd. rose 25
Hong Kong cents to HK$26.45 in  Asia . Wynn listed part of the
Macau unit in October 2009.  Macau Resorts  Revenue jumped 37 percent in Macau and 23 percent in Las
Vegas, boosting total sales 32 percent to $1.37 billion and
beating the $1.27 billion analysts projected in a Bloomberg
survey.  Gambling in Macau has surged since the government ended
Stanley Ho’s 40-year monopoly and let other companies, including
Wynn,  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS)  and  MGM Resorts International (MGM) , build
resorts that attract Chinese mainlanders.  Overall Las Vegas Strip gambling revenue climbed 29 percent
to $580.4 million in May, according to data from the Nevada
Gaming Commission. Visitation rose 4.7 percent in the first five
months of 2011, led by an 8.1 percent increase in convention
attendance, which has increased room rates and occupancy,
according to the Las Vegas Convention & Visitors Authority.  Wynn said its Las Vegas average daily room rate rose 22
percent in the second quarter. Occupancy fell to 89.2 percent,
from 92.6 percent a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
