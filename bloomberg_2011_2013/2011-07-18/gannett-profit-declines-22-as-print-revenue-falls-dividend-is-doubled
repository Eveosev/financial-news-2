Gannett Co., the owner of 82
newspapers as well as television stations, reported second-
quarter profit decreased 22 percent as circulation and print
advertising declined. The company also doubled its dividend.  Net income dropped to $151.5 million, or 62 cents a share,
from $195.5 million, or 81 cents, a year earlier, the McLean,
Virginia-based company said today in a statement. Excluding some
items, earnings fell to 58 cents a share. Analysts predicted 56
cents, the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Gannett, whose newspapers include  USA Today , is the first
large newspaper owner to report its results for the quarter,
making it an indicator of how the industry is faring. Publishing
revenue, including advertising and circulation, declined 4.9
percent to $977.1 million. Digital revenue rose 13 percent.  Total revenue fell 2.2 percent to $1.33 billion, matching
the average analystsâ€™ estimate.  Last month, Gannett Co. said it plans to cut about 700 jobs
at its community-newspaper unit as it struggles with continuing
weakness in local and national advertising.  The company also said today it will double its quarterly
dividend to 8 cents a share and that it plans to buy back as
much as $100 million of shares over the next 12 months.  Gannett fell 47 cents to $13.01 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have lost 14 percent this
year.  (Gannett held a conference call today at 10 a.m. New York
