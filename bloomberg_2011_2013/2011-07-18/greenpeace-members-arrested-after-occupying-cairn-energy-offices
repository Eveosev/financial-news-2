About 20 Greenpeace activists were
arrested at the Edinburgh headquarters of  Cairn Energy Plc (CNE)  today
after protesting against Cairn’s refusal to publish its spill-
response plans for deep-water drilling off Greenland, the
environmental group said.  The activists entered the offices to “search for a copy of
the company’s secret oil spill plans,” Greenpeace said in an e-
mailed statement. Lothian and Borders police said in a statement
on its website that “a number of people” were arrested at
Cairn’s offices and will appear at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court
tomorrow.  Activists who occupied the headquarters left the building
after police intervened, Cairn said in an e-mailed statement.
The company said on June 6 that its oil-spill-response plan,
developed with Greenland authorities, wasn’t available to the
public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
