Malawian civil society groups plan
to hold national demonstrations on July 20 to protest against
government policies and a continuing fuel shortage, the groups
said.  “The peaceful demonstrations have been organized as part
of our constitutional right to express alarm regarding the
current economic and democratic crises facing Malawi,” the
groups, including the Malawi Law Society and Malawi Council of
Churches, said in a statement published in the Blantyre-based
Nation newspaper today.   The U.K. is reviewing relations with the country after its
envoy was deported, reducing aid, and the nation has suffered
recurrent fuel shortages due to a lack of foreign currency.  The main opposition party will join the protest, Malawi
Congress Party President John Tembo said on Zodiak Broadcasting
Station.  To contact the reporter on this story:
