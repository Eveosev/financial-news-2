Japan’s government will meet to
discuss power demand and supply as early as tomorrow after
 Kansai Electric  Power Co. shut a reactor at one of its nuclear
stations, the Sankei newspaper reported, without citing anyone.  The meeting will be led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano, the Japanese-language newspaper said. Customers of Kansai
Electric will be asked to save power, it said. Power shortages
are expected to worsen after the shutdown, Trade Minister  Banri Kaieda  said, according to the report.  Kansai Electric, which supplies power to  Osaka  and
surrounding areas, closed the No. 1 reactor at its Ohi nuclear
plant on July 16 because of a malfunction. The reactor has been
running without final approval from regulators since March after
being shutdown for regular maintenance.  The company hasn’t heard anything from the government on
the meeting or requests to customers to save power, spokesman
Jun Takahashi said by phone today.  The utility will run short of capacity after the shutdown,
Masaki Toratake, a spokesman, said yesterday. Two more of Kansai
Electric’s reactors are due to close for maintenance by the end
of this month.  Mandatory power savings have been imposed in some areas of
 Japan  after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami knocked out
capacity and caused three reactor meltdowns at Tokyo Electric
Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant. Other reactors
closed down safely after the disaster or have been idled for
scheduled maintenance, exacerbating shortages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
