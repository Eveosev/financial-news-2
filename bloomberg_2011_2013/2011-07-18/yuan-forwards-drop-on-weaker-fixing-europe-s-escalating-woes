China ’s yuan forwards dropped for a
second day after the central bank set a weaker fixing and as
demand for emerging-market assets waned on  Europe ’s escalating
debt concerns.  The People’s Bank of China set the currency’s reference
rate 0.02 percent lower at 6.4680 per dollar as European bank
tests showed lenders may need to raise as much as 80 billion
euros ($113 billion) to shore up capital. Euro-area government
leaders are due to hold a special summit in Brussels on July 21
in an effort to stop the debt contagion from spreading.  “Investors aren’t convinced that the euro zone debt crisis
is ending soon with the latest Europe stress tests,” said Tommy Ong, senior vice-president of treasury and markets at DBS Bank
(Hong Kong) Ltd. “The yuan fell on poor  market sentiment  and
because of the lower fixing.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.1 percent
to 6.4045 per dollar as of 10:11 a.m. in  Shanghai , a 0.9 percent
premium to the spot rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The yuan declined 0.02 percent to 6.4646, prices from
the China Foreign Exchange Trade System show. The currency
touched 6.4563 on July 14, the strongest level since China
unified official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  The fixing was set lower for a second day. The yuan isn’t
allowed to trade more than 0.5 percent on either side of that
rate. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan slipped 0.06
percent to 6.4655.  Eight of 90 lenders failed the European Banking Authority’s
stress tests released on July 15, which included a review of how
banks would cope with a 0.5 percent economic contraction in the
euro area in 2011, a 15 percent drop in European equity markets
and trading losses on sovereign debt not held to maturity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
