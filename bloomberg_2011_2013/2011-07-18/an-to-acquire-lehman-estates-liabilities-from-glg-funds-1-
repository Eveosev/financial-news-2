Man Group Plc (EMG) , the world’s largest
hedge fund manager, will pay $355 million to acquire the
remaining liabilities to Lehman estates from funds managed by
GLG Partners LP.  The transaction for the liabilities at their current net
asset value is payable in cash, Man Group said in a statement
today.  “These transactions will remove the remaining uncertainty
from funds with residual claims against the Lehman estates, to
the benefit of both existing and new investors,” said Chief
Executive Officer  Peter Clarke  in the statement.  Man acquired GLG Partners for $1.6 billion in October to
try to reduce its dependence on Man AHL Diversified Plc, a
computer-driven investment program. GLG was founded in 1995 as a
division of  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  and went public in
2007 through a reverse merger.  To contact the reporter on this story:
