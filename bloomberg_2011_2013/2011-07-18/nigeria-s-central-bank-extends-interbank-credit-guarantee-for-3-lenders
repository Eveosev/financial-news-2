Nigeria ’s central bank extended its
inter-bank credit guarantee for three bailed-out banks until the
end of December, it said in a notice published today in Lagos-
based Punch newspaper.  The guarantees for  Intercontinental Bank Plc (INTERCON) ,  Union Bank
Nigeria Plc (UBN)  and  Finbank Plc (FIRSTINL)  were extended after the lenders
signed transaction agreements with new investors, the  Central
Bank of Nigeria  said. Other bailed-out banks are making progress
in meeting a Sept. 30 deadline to recapitalize, it said.  Central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi fired the chief
executives of eight banks in 2009 after loans to equity
speculators contributed to 700 billion naira ($4.6 billion) of
non-performing debt, according to the Economic and Financial
Crimes Commission in Abuja. The regulator provided a 620 billion
naira bailout for the lenders and set up the state-owned Asset
Management Corp. of Nigeria to buy their bad debt.  “With the signing of the agreement the three banks have
been able to resolve close to 50 percent of the recapitalization
problem,” the central bank said. “The next step for the banks
is to seek regulatory approval which may take two months.”  The other five banks are expected “to move to the next
stage, at which time they will be granted a similar extension,”
the bank said. Those banks are Oceanic Bank International Plc,
Afribank Plc, Equitorial Trust Bank Ltd., Bank PHB Plc and
Spring Bank Plc.  The central bank’s spokesman was unavailable for comment
when called today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
