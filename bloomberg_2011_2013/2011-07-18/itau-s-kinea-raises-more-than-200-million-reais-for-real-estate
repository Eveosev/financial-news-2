Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) ’s Kinea
investment firm raised more than 200 million reais ($126
million) for a real-estate fund, increasing the fund’s total
assets to 500 million reais, according to an e-mailed statement.  The Sao Paulo-based firm said the Kinea Renda Imobiliaria
FII fund attracted more demand than the 150 million reais
originally expected.  Kinea started the fund last year to invest in commercial
real estate in  Sao Paulo  and Rio de Janeiro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
