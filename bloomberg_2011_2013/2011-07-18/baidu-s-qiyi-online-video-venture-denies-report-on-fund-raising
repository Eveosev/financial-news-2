Qiyi.com Inc., the Chinese online
video venture majority owned by Baidu Inc., denied  a published
report   that it’s seeking to raise $300 million of financing.  “The news is not true,” Qiyi.com said in an e-mailed
statement today, denying a July 15 report by Dow Jones & Co.’s
LBO Wire. The online-video company will disclose its capital
raising plans at an “appropriate time,” it said.  Baidu and Legend Holdings Ltd.’s Hony Capital are among
investors that agreed to offer financing to Qiyi.com, LBO Wire
reported, citing a person it didn’t identify.  Baidu, owner of China’s most-popular search-engine, holds a
61 percent stake in Qiyi.com. Providence Equity Partners, an
investor in Hulu LLC, last year provided $50 million of funding
to Qiyi.com.  To contact the reporter on this story:
