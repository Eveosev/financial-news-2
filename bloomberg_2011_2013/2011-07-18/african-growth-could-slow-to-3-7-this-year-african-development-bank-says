Economic growth in  Africa  may slow
to 3.7 percent this year before picking up in 2012 as the
northern part of the continent recovers from the impact of
social unrest, the African Development Bank said.  The continent will experience a “twin-track” expansion,
with the economy of North Africa expanding 0.7 percent and the
rest of the continent seen growing 4.7 percent, Mthuli Ncube,
the Tunis-based lender’s chief economist, told reporters in  Dar
es Salaam , Tanzania, today. As a whole, Africa will grow 5.8
percent in 2012, up from 4.9 percent last year, he said.  “Growth next year will be driven by a recovery story we
hope to see in Ivory Coast, Tunisia and  Egypt ,” Ncube said in
an interview today. The three countries experienced civil unrest
this year that resulted in changes of governments.  Faster global growth and increased domestic demand will
also help revive expansion in Africa next year, he said. The so-
called emerging trade partners such as Brazil, China, India,
Turkey and South Korea now account for 37 percent of Africa’s
trade, according to Ncube.  To contact the reporter on this story:
