Russian stock-index futures fell for
a fourth consecutive session as investors bet that European
leaders won’t agree on a way to contain the region’s debt crisis
at a summit this week, and talks continued over raising the U.S.
debt ceiling. Oil declined.  Futures on the dollar-denominated index expiring in
September dropped 0.1 percent to 188,820.  Contracts on OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s largest lender, slid
0.2 percent and those on OAO Lukoil, Russia’s second-biggest oil
producer, dropped 0.1 percent. Futures on OAO Gazprom, the
world’s largest gas producer, rose 0.1 percent.  Concern that Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis is far from
being resolved pushed the cost of insuring against default on
bonds sold by Greece, Ireland, Italy,  Portugal  and France to
records. Italy’s 10-year bond yield exceeded 6 percent,
approaching the 7 percent mark that prompted Greece, Ireland and
Portugal to seek bailouts.  “Continued European debt overhang and no solution in sight
for the U.S.’s own debt ceiling is spilling into Russia’s RTS
futures this evening,”  Luis Saenz , chief executive officer of
the U.S. unit of Otkritie Financial Corp. -- a brokerage partly
owned by Russia’s second-largest bank, VTB Group -- wrote in e-
mailed comments yesterday. “External factors drove the Russian
market.”  Crude for August delivery declined $1.31, or 1.3 percent,
to settle at $95.93 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  The euro fell to a record versus the Swiss franc and
dropped as much as 1 percent against the dollar in the biggest
intraday decline since July 12 before trading at $1.4119 at 5:01
p.m. in  New York , compared with $1.4157 on July 15. Some
investors buy dollar-denominated assets to protect value when
the dollar weakens against the euro and sell them when the
dollar gains.  U.S. stocks fell as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
declined 0.8 percent to 1,305.44. The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF) 
dropped 1.6 percent to 1,687.63 in Moscow yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
