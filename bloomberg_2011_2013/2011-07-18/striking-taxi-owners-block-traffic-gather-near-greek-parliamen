Striking Greek taxi drivers
disrupted traffic in  Athens  today in protest at government plans
to ease regulation of the profession.  Drivers, who began a 48-hour strike at 5 a.m., blocked one
of the main roads to the Athens-based parliament for almost two
hours from 1 p.m., after police stopped them assembling directly
in front of the chamber. Earlier, drivers disrupted traffic on
roads to Athens International Airport and Piraeus Port.  About 3,000 taxis had assembled on the road leading to the
airport and about 2,500 in front of the harbour, Makis
Kasidiaris, vice president of the Association of Attica Taxi
Drivers, said in a telephone interview.  The traffic congestion caused by the taxis, which had
blocked off all but one lane on a stretch of the main highway to
the airport, caused delays to flights averaging 15 to 20
minutes, a spokesman for Athens International said.  The taxi owners are opposing attempts by the government to
make it easier to obtain taxi licences. The changes are part of
a government push to liberalize dozens of professions in  Greece ,
one of the conditions for last year’s 110 billion-euro ($155
billion) European Union-led bailout.  “The way in which this protest is being made is genuinely
very bad, at a critical time for tourism, on which every Greek
family depends, including those of the taxi drivers,” said
Culture and Tourism Minister Pavlos Yeroulanos, according to a
statement from the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
