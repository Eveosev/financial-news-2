Naftna Industrija Srbije AD plans to
start fuel retailing in Republika Srpska, the Serbian entity in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Chief Executive Officer said.  The company plans between 20 and 25 gas stations there “in
a first phase” that may start next year, Kravchenko said in
Belgrade today. The company may decide to enlarge the network
that will be supplied from NIS’s refineries in  Serbia , he said.  “It’s another direction of our development in Republika
Srpska,” Kravcenko said.  The Belgrade-based NIS, majority owned by  Russia ’s OAO
Gazprom Neft, already runs a network of 480 fuel stations and
warehouses in Serbia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
