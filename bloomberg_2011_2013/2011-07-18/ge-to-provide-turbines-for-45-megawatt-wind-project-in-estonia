General Electric Co. (GE) , the world’s
biggest maker of electricity-generation equipment, will supply
18 turbines to two power companies that are building a 45-
megawatt wind farm in northwest  Estonia .  GE will begin shipments to Eesti Energia AS and Nelja
Energia OU in the first half of 2012 and the Paldiski Wind Farm
is expected to go into operation by the end of next year, the
Fairfield, Connecticut-based company said today in a statement.
Each power company is buying nine of GE’s 2.5-megawatt machines,
its first turbine sales in the country. The company declined to
give financial details when contacted by telephone.  Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Immelt  told reporters last
week that demand for wind outside the U.S. remains strong. In
June the company said it would supply 40 turbines to a wind park
in  Sweden .  Eduardo Tabbush, an industry analyst at Bloomberg New
Energy Finance in London, said that Estonia doesn’t have a large
wind sector.  “It might experience some growth, but it is not a key
market,” he said.  The former Soviet republic currently has 149 megawatts of
wind-power capacity in operation, according to the Estonian Wind
Power Association. A further 260 megawatts are under
construction or with financing agreed, according to Bloomberg
New Energy Finance data. More than 2,000 megawatts of onshore
and offshore programs have also been announced, making Estonia
the 16th most active wind developer in the European Union, the
data shows.  To contact the reporters on this story:
