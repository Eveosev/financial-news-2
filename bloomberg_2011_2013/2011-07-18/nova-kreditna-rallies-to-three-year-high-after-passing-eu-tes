(Corrects to say shares rose the most since 2008.)  Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor d.d.
rose the most in almost three years after the Slovenian bank
said European Union regulators found it has sufficient capital
to withstand a recession and a sovereign debt crisis.  Nova Kreditna jumped 7.1 percent to 7.1 euros at its 2:30
p.m. close in Ljubljana, its biggest one-day gain since
November 2008, valuing the company at 185.2 million euros.
Nearly 5,400 shares traded today, almost twice the three-month
daily average.  The lender’s core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of
financial strength, was 8 percent in the test’s adverse
scenario for 2012 and 8.2 percent for this year, surpassing
the 5 percent minimum required by the European Banking
Authority’s tests, the company said in a statement late on
July 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
