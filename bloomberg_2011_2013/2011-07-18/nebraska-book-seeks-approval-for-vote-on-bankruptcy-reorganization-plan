Nebraska  Book Co., the operator of a
chain of college bookstores, asked a court to let creditors vote
on a reorganization plan that would turn the company over to two
groups of noteholders.  The company filed the proposal and related papers yesterday
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington,  Delaware , with plans to
win creditor support and court approval to exit bankruptcy by
Nov. 3.  The plan “is based on a consensual deal with the debtors’
key stakeholders and contemplates a significant de-leveraging of
the debtors’ balance sheets,” the company said in a disclosure
statement describing the proposal.  Nebraska Book, based in Lincoln, Nebraska, filed for
bankruptcy last month listing $657.2 million in assets and
$564 million in debt as of Feb. 14.  The company has an agreement supported by holders of more
than 95 percent of its 8.625 percent senior subordinated notes
and more than 75 percent of its 11 percent discount notes. The
bookseller said in a June 27 statement it will restructure about
$450 million in loans and bonds of its parent, NBC Acquisition
Corp., and affiliates.  Under the plan, $175 million of the senior subordinated
notes would be converted into $30.6 million in secured notes,
$120 million in unsecured notes and 78 percent of the new
equity. Holders of the $77 million in 11 percent discount notes
would get the remaining 22 percent of the stock.  Secured Claims  Secured lenders, owed about $26.3 million, and secured
noteholders, owed about $200 million, would be paid in full with
cash, the company said.  Nebraska Book currently has about 280 stores on and off
campuses. It also has one of the largest wholesale distribution
networks of used textbooks, supplying college bookstores with
more than 105,000 different book titles and selling more than
6.3 million books a year.  The case is In re Nebraska Book Co. Inc., 11-12005,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
