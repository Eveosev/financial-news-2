A 4 billion-euro ($5.6 billion) plan
to install “smart” power meters in 35 million homes across
 France  would benefit power grids, consumers and industry, the
country’s energy regulator said in a ruling.  A pilot project called “Linky” in which 250,000 devices
were tested in homes near the cities of Lyon and Tours should be
extended, the Commission de Regulation de l’Energie said today
in a statement. The initial cost of the project is 4 billion
euros, the regulator said.  “A rapid decision to promote Linky meters would be very
favorable to French industry,” according to the regulator. The
French experiment is unique and domestic standards could be
adopted internationally, it said.  The regulator’s backing of the plan paves the way for
government approval. Energy Minister Eric Besson said in May the
government will decide by the end of September whether to extend
the meters to all French power consumers. The meters can be
monitored remotely and provide real-time information about power
use to promote more efficiency.  France is aiming to meet European Union requirements for
the installation of smart meters in homes by 2020, Besson has
said. The country would publish tenders for the meters, which
could be installed in homes at a rate of about 6 million a year,
Michelle Bellon, president of Electricite de France SA’s ERDF
distribution unit, said in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
