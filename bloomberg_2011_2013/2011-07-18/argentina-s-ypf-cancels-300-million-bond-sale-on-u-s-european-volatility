YPF SA (YPFD) ,  Argentina ’s biggest oil
producer, said it is canceling a $300 million bond sale set for
this week due to “volatility” in European and U.S. markets.  “Considering the exceptional circumstances of public
knowledge that the international markets are going through
during the past few weeks, and especially the high volatility in
European and U.S. markets, YPF is postponing its bond
issuance,” according to a regulatory  filing  posted to
Argentina’s stock exchange today.  YPF had extended its bond sale until July 22 from July 14.  Papermaker Celulosa Argentina SA said it will cancel a $150
million bond sale due to “volatility” in international
financial markets on July 15. Cia de Transporte de Energia
Electrica en Alta Tension Transener S.A. plans to sell up to
$150 million of 10-years bonds, according to  Standard & Poor’s .  McDonald’s operator Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. snapped an
11-week drought in Argentine corporate offerings when it sold
$256 million of real-linked bonds earlier this month.  Buenos
Aires  Province sold an additional $250 million of its 11.75
percent dollar bonds due in 2015 to yield 10.875 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  YPF shares dropped as much as 1.1 percent to 180 pesos
after the statement was published.  The company will try to sell bonds again if present market
conditions are “reverted,” according to the filing. YPF is
authorized to sell up to $1 billion of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
