Americans haven’t felt this bad in
almost three decades.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the correlation between the U.S.
Misery Index, or the sum of the unemployment and inflation
rates, and measures of  consumer confidence .  The Misery Index stands at 12.8, the highest in 28 years.
Consumer sentiment slumped in July to the lowest level in more
than two years, a report from Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan showed last week. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index
is lower than it was at the start of the year.  “Misery does seem to have a pretty close relationship with
measures of consumer confidence, and confidence has a fairly
good relationship with actual consumption growth,” said Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics Ltd. in
Toronto. It shows “how bad things are as it’s something
everyone can relate to quite easily,” he said.  The Misery Index is the highest since May 1983 when
unemployment was 10.1 percent, inflation was 3.5 percent and the
economy was recovering from the 1981-82 recession.  Joblessness climbed to 9.2 percent in June, the third
straight increase, and consumer prices were up 3.6 percent last
month from a year ago, according to Labor Department figures.  The Misery Index was conceived by Arthur Okun, an economist
at  Yale University  and the Brookings Institution who served as
an adviser to Presidents  John F. Kennedy  and  Lyndon Johnson .  To contact the reporter on this story:
