Typhoon Ma-on weakened to a tropical
storm as it moved on a course that will take it over central
Japan today, passing south of  Tokyo  before heading out to sea,
the  U.S. Navy Joint Typhoon Warning Center  said.  The storm was about about 550 kilometers (340 miles)
southwest of Tokyo at 12:50 a.m. local time today, the  Japan
Meteorological Agency  said on its website. Ma-on was moving
north-northeast at 10 kilometers per hour with winds blowing at
139 kilometers per hour, the agency said.  The storm may reach Wakayama prefecture in central Japan
this morning and be west of Hachijo island, 290 kilometers south
of Tokyo by midnight before continuing out to sea, the agency
said.  An earlier  forecast  indicated the storm may pass over Tokyo
Electric Power Co.’s crippled Fukushima nuclear plant by July
21. The JMA maintained warnings for heavy rains and landslides
for Tokyo and Fukushima 220 kilometers to the north, it said on
the website.  Japan  Airlines Co. canceled 93 domestic and four
international flights, while All Nippon Airways Co. halted 218
flights in Japan, the carriers said in faxed statements
yesterday.  JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp. halted the berthing of vessels
at five refineries in eastern and western Japan, the company
said yesterday. Idemitsu Kosan Co. halted shipments at two
refineries because of the storm, chemicals news service ICIS
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
