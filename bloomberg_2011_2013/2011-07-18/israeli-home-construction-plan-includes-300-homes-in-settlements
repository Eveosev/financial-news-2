Israel  plans to build 6,900 housing
units around the country, including about 300 in West Bank
settlements such as  Karnei Shomron , to help alleviate a shortage
in the Tel Aviv area, an official said.  The government will seek bids for building projects in 38
cities across Israel, Ariel Rosenberg, spokesman for the Housing
and Construction Ministry, said today in a text message. Karnei
Shomron and Beitar Illit, where most of the West Bank building
is planned, are among the biggest settlements in the territory
Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.  Previous construction in West Bank settlements has spurred
international protests and prompted Palestinian Authority
President  Mahmoud Abbas  last year to halt peace negotiations
with Israel just weeks after they resumed.  The shortage of affordable rental apartments sparked
protests last weekend, with young Israelis pitching tents
overnight along fashionable Rothschild Boulevard.  To contact the reporter on this story:
