OAO Novolipetsk Steel, Russian
billionaire  Vladimir Lisin ’s steelmaker, said second-quarter
revenue rose 24 percent from the previous three months as
production and prices increased.  Sales are expected to have risen to $2.9 billion in the
period, the company known as NLMK said in a statement today,
citing preliminary estimates. The margin on earnings before
interest taxes, depreciation and amortization will be in the
range of 25 percent to 30 percent.  Crude steel production rose 3.1 percent to 3 million metric
tons, NLMK said. Operating performance should improve
“significantly” in the current quarter after NLMK acquired the
remaining 50 percent of its joint venture with Duferco Group,
the company said.  The Lipetsk, central Russia-based steelmaker paid Duferco
$600 million this month to gain control of the Steel Invest &
Finance venture, which includes seven steel-rolling mills in
 Europe  and the U.S. NLMK doubled sales of semi-finished steel to
the venture in the second quarter, it said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
