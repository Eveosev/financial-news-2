The Czech ruling-coalition party
Public Affairs won’t support plans to unify the value-added-tax
rate at 19 percent,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing Vit Barta, the head of Public Affairs parliamentary caucus.  Prime Minister Petr Necas said the government may unify the
VAT at 19 percent to boost state budget revenue and reduce the
deficit, the newspaper said.  The government in May approved a plan to increase the lower
VAT bracket to 14 percent from 10 percent and maintain the upper
bracket at 20 percent next year. Under the plan, the two rates
will be unified at 17.5 percent from 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
