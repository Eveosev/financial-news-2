Ross Greenburg is stepping down
after 33 years at  HBO , where he has been president of the
network’s sports division since 2000.  Greenburg, 56, told the New York Times that he decided not
to renew his contract with  HBO  because he’s tired of exhausting
negotiations with boxing managers and promoters.  In addition to running HBO’s boxing coverage, Greenburg
created the network’s “Real Sports” and “Hard Knocks”
programs and oversaw production of numerous documentaries. His
last project was a documentary on  Derek Jeter ’s pursuit of 3,000
career hits with the  New York Yankees .  “He has helped redefine the sports programming genre and
set an extraordinary standard of excellence in the industry,”
HBO Co-President Richard Plepler and President of Programming
Michael Lombardo said of Greenburg in a statement. “We will
miss his leadership, vision, creativity and passion for sports
television.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
