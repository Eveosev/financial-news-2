Kuwait’s economy is “witnessing
imbalances” that need solutions to avoid any adverse impact on
the country’s future, according to a cabinet statement citing
Central Bank Governor Sheikh Salem AbdulAziz Al-Sabah.  The imbalances, if not treated, “could result in threats
and risks at various levels,” the governor said during a
cabinet meeting yesterday, according to a statement posted on
the Council of Ministers’  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
