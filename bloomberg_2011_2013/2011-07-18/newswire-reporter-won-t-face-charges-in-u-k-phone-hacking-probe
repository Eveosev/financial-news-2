A reporter for the U.K. news service
Press Association, who was arrested last month, has been told by
police that she won’t face charges relating to an investigation
into phone hacking.  Laura Elston, 34, was told by police that her bail
conditions were canceled and she would face no further action.  The newswire conducted an “extensive internal inquiry into
this matter and found no trace of wrongdoing,” Press
Association’s chief executive, Clive Marshall, said. “We are
delighted that this matter has been brought to an end and that
Laura Elston and the Press Association have been completely
exonerated.”  Elston, who was detained at a central  London  police station
on suspicion of unlawfully intercepting mobile-phone voice mail
messages, was one of ten people who have been arrested in the
probe so far.  To contact the reporter on this story:
