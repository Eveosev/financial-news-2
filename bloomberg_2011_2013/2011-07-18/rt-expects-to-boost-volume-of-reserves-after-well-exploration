HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA (HRTP3) ,
the Brazilian  oil company  that raised $1.5 billion in an initial
public offering last year, expects to increase the volume of
potential reserves it will develop with TNK-BP.  HRT will hire auditing firm  DeGolyer and MacNaughton  to
review new data after the company completes its first four
exploration wells in late August, HRT Chief Executive Officer
Marcio Mello said in a telephone interview from  Rio de Janeiro .  The company has about 1 billion barrels of oil and natural
gas resources at its 21 Solimoes blocks, while the 45 percent
stake TNK-BP agreed to buy holds an estimated 794 million
barrels, according to a 2010 study by DeGolyer and MacNaughton.  “This is just the tip of the iceberg,” Mello said. “If
things go as we expect it will be a very good business for
everybody.”  TNK-BP, BP Plc’s Russian oil venture with a group of
billionaires, agreed today to buy Petra Energia SA’s 45 percent
stake in 21 exploration blocks in  Brazil ’s Solimoes Basin in a
drive to expand abroad. HRT’s board will approve the partnership
and has already started negotiating the investment program for
the Solimoes Basin with TNK-BP, Mello said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
