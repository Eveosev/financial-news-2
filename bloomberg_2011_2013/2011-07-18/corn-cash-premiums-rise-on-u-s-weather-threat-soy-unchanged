Cash premiums for U.S. corn shipped
in July to export terminals near  New Orleans  widened relative to
Chicago futures as hot weather threatens U.S. crops. The soybean
basis was unchanged.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was $1 to $1.01 a bushel above September futures, compared
with $1 on July 15, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show.
The corn basis is nearly three times the 34-cent to 36-cent
premium of a  year earlier . The soybean premium was 82 cents to
85 cents a bushel above August futures.  “The hot weather this week will increase stress on crops,
which is supporting a firm basis,”  Scott Stoller, a grain
merchandiser for Michlig Agricenter Inc., said by telephone from
Manlius,  Illinois . “River demand for corn and soybeans is
pretty tame.”  Corn futures for September delivery fell 5 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $6.9625 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
first drop after seven straight gains during a 13 percent rally
that began July 6.  Soybean futures for August delivery dropped 0.25 cent to
$13.855 a bushel on the CBOT, the first [bn:WBTKR=GRINCORN:IND] drop in a week.  The amount of corn inspected [] for export in the week ended
July 14 fell 15 percent from a week earlier, the USDA said
today. Soybeans inspected for export tumbled 40 percent to 3.71
million bushels, the lowest in a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
