European private banks saw a rebound
in profit margins last year after net asset inflows and cost
cutting, according to McKinsey & Co.  Average profit margins rose to 24 basis points from 20
basis points in 2009, McKinsey said in a survey of 160 firms
published today. That is still 11 basis points below levels in
the period between 2005 and 2007 amid lower trading activity and
greater  risk aversion  among clients, the report said.  Revenue margins were “more or less flat” at 83 basis
points, the survey showed. A basis point is one hundredth of 1
percent. Net inflows averaged about 2 percent of total assets
under management in 2010 compared with pre-crisis levels of 7
percent to 8 percent, McKinsey said.  “Profitability and net inflows are still well below the
levels achieved before the crisis, key offshore markets remain
under pressure and the impact of new regulation on the sector
has yet to be felt,” McKinsey said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
