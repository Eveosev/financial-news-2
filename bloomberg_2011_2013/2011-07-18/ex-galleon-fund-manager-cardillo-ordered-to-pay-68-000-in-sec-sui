Michael Cardillo, who pleaded guilty
in the Galleon Group LLC hedge-fund insider trading case, was
ordered to pay more than $68,000 as part of a U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission suit.  Cardillo pleaded guilty in January to  securities fraud  and
conspiracy and agreed to cooperate with the government. U.S.
District Judge Richard J. Sullivan today ordered Cardillo to pay
$68,520, representing profits he gained as a result of his
conduct and other penalties. He was sued by the SEC in January.  Cardillo, who worked at Galleon from 2003 to 2009 in the
back office and was a trader and portfolio manager, testified in
May as a government witness at the insider-trading trial of
former Galleon trader  Zvi Goffer , his brother Emanuel Goffer and
Michael Kimelman, who worked with both brothers at Incremental
Capital LLC after Zvi Goffer left Galleon.  The Goffer brothers and Kimelman were convicted in June on
charges of securities fraud and conspiracy stemming from one of
three overlapping rings tied to Galleon co-founder Raj Rajaratnam.  The judgment marks the end of the SEC’s case against
Cardillo. A sentencing date for Cardillo hasn’t been set.  Rajaratnam was found guilty May 11 in the largest insider-
trading prosecution in a generation. He was convicted on 14
counts of securities fraud and conspiracy and prosecutors say
may be given as long as 19 1/2 years in prison when he’s
sentenced.  The case is SEC v. Cardillo, 11-CV-549, Southern District
of  New York  ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
