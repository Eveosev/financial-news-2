The  European Central Bank  said it
removed 18.8 percent fewer counterfeited euro banknotes from
circulation in the first half of the year compared with the
previous six months.  The Frankfurt-based central bank withdrew 295,553 forged
notes in the first half, compared with about 364,000 in the
second half of last year, the ECB said in a statement today.
There were on average 13.8 billion genuine euro banknotes in
circulation in the first six months of 2011, it said.  The most counterfeited denominations remain 20-euro and 50-
euro notes, which together account for 79 percent of discovered
forgeries, the ECB said. The number of counterfeited notes
detected has been declining since the second half of 2009, when
447,000 were withdrawn from circulation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
