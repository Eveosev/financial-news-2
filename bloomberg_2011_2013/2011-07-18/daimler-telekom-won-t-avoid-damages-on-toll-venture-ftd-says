Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) 
have been told by an arbitration court that they won’t be able
to avoid paying damages to Germany’s government over the delay
of their Toll Collect truck-toll venture,  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, citing people familiar with the case.  The court didn’t rule out the operators’ liability for the
delay as the government claimed the companies displayed “gross
professional misconduct” and didn’t have a functioning risk
management, the newspaper said. The court will probably rule in
the coming months on how to bring the seven-year proceedings to
an end, FTD reported, adding that a settlement is more likely
than a judgement.  The Toll Collect partnership set up a toll system in 2005
for trucks using highways in  Germany . The project was about 16
months late, resulting in penalties and interest payments.  The government is claiming 5.1 billion euros ($7.2
billion), the newspaper said, adding that the companies haven’t
set aside any reserves for damages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
