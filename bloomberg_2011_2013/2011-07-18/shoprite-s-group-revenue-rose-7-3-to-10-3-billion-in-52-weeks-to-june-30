Shoprite Holdings Ltd. (SHP) ,  South
Africa ’s largest retailer by market value, fell the most in more
than a week after fiscal full-year sales fell short of analyst
estimates.  The stock dropped 1.89 rand, or 1.8 percent, the biggest
one-day decline since July 8, to 102.26 rand. Earlier today it
fell as much as 2.9 percent.  Sales increased by 7.3 percent to 72.3 billion rand ($10.3
billion) in the 12 months through June, Cape Town-based Shoprite
said in a statement today. The median estimate of 7 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for full-year sales of 73.6 billion
rand. Shoprite will release a full earnings report on Aug. 23.  While South Africans became more optimistic about the
prospects for economic growth in the next year, they remained
“relatively prudent” in their purchases of durable goods, such
as TVs and furniture, in part because they expect  interest rates 
to increase soon,  First National Bank  and the Bureau for
Economic Research said on June 21.  Food prices at Shoprite declined 0.1 percent in the 12
months through June, the company said, compared with year-
earlier inflation of 2.2 percent. Sales at Shoprite’s furniture
division grew 1.9 percent compared with a year-earlier increase
of 3.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
