Gold rose to a record $1,607.90 an
ounce, capping the longest rally in 31 years, as debt concerns
in  Europe  and the U.S. boosted demand for the metal as a haven.  President Barack Obama is pressing congressional leaders
for a multitrillion-dollar agreement in talks on cutting the
deficit. A default would cause more panic than the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008,  Larry Summers , a former
Treasury Secretary, told CNN in an interview broadcast
yesterday. The euro fell as European leaders plan to meet again
on the debt crisis.  “There’s just a lack of confidence in government and
currency,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “There’s a flight-to-
safety into gold. When Europe fixes their house and the U.S.
fixes our house, maybe then there’ll be in a correction in
gold.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose $12.30, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $1,602.40 at 1:37 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . The metal was up for the 10th straight session, the
longest rally since January 1980, when the price climbed to
$873, a record at the time.  UBS AG said in a report that its Zurich sales desk on July
15 had the biggest gold-coin demand in a year. The metal
denominated in euros and pounds jumped to records after European
Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  reiterated his
opposition to any restructuring of Greek debt.  ‘Fearful’ on Euro  “Europeans primarily are fearful about the future of their
currency and are exiting positions there for Swiss francs and
gold,” Dennis Gartman, an economist, said in his Suffolk,
Virginia-based Gartman Letter. “Were we a German lawyer, or
doctor, or small business owners, we’d be buying gold.”  Gold has doubled since early December 2008 as the  Federal
Reserve  kept interest rates at a record low and governments
spent trillions of dollars to prop up the economy after the
most-severe global recession since World War II.  The Treasury Department has warned the U.S. debt ceiling
must be lifted by Aug. 2 to avoid default.  Standard & Poor’s  and
Moody’s Investors Service may downgrade the government’s credit
rating if Congress doesn’t act.  Silver futures for September delivery rose $1.271, or 3.3
percent, to $40.342 an ounce, the highest settlement since May
3. The price jumped 9.6 percent in the previous three sessions.
On April 25, the price reached $49.845, a 31-year high.  Palladium futures for September delivery rose $13.95, or
1.8 percent, to $794.60 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Platinum futures for October delivery rose $19.90, or
1.1 percent, to $1,775.40 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
