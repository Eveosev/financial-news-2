Michael Ahearn, founder and former
chief executive officer of  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , has formed a $300
million venture capital company to back energy, water,
agriculture and waste companies.  The company, True North Venture Partners, plans to invest
$100,000 to $25 million primarily in early-stage companies, it
said today in a statement. The Chicago-based company will focus
on areas where “global problems are pressing, the need for
disruptive innovation is great and the challenges faced by early
stage entrepreneurs and investors are 
particularly daunting,” Ahearn said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
