Six Tunisian policemen were injured
when “religious extremists” set police stations and public
property on fire in six provinces across  Tunisia , the Interior
Ministry said in a faxed statement.  The perpetrators had seized two machine guns from Menzel
Bourguiba, about 60 kilometres north of the capital, before
carrying out the attacks on Saturday night, the ministry said.  The incidents are an attempt to “undermine the climate of
stability and security” that now prevailed after the
lawlessness following the ouster of president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali on Jan. 14, the ministry said.  The ministry said that “extremist political parties” were
trying to “sabotage” the election for a Constituent Assembly
planned on Oct. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
