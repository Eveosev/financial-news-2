Taiwan ’s dollar fell for a second
day as worse-than-expected U.S. economic data added to signs the
global recovery is stalling, dimming the outlook for the
island’s exports.  The currency traded near a two-week low after an index of
U.S. consumer sentiment decreased to 63.8, the lowest in more
than two years and below the 72.2 median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Overseas investors sold $303 million more
Taiwanese shares than they bought today, bringing net sales this
year to $525 million, according to exchange data.  “Sentiment was sapped because of the weak U.S. data that
came out,” said  Albert Lee , a Taipei-based fixed-income trader
at Cathay United Bank Co. “Investors are concerned whether a
slowdown in economic growth will affect Taiwan’s economy and the
tightening cycle.”  The  Taiwan dollar  dropped 0.2 percent to NT$28.960 against
its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. close, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. It touched NT$29.00 on July 13, the weakest level
since June 28.  Government bonds  were little changed. The rate on the 2
percent notes due July 2016, the most-traded government debt,
was 1.187 percent, compared with 1.182 percent on July 15,
prices from Gretai Securities Market show. That’s the highest
level for a benchmark five-year note since January 2009.  The overnight rate, which measures interbank funding
availability, was little changed today at 0.373 percent, from
0.374 percent at the end of last week, according to a weighted
average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  -- Editors: Andrew Janes, Sandy Hendry  To contact the reporter on this story:
