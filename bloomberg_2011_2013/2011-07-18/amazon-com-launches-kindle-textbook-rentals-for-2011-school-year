Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the world’s largest
online retailer, will begin offering electronic-textbook rentals
to draw more young people to its Kindle electronic reader.  Rentals on the Kindle device will be at discounts of as
much as 80 percent from the purchase price of a paper book, the
Seattle-based company said in a statement today.  The move will help Amazon persuade more students to buy
Kindles, said Herman Leung, an analyst at Susquehanna Investment
Group in  San Francisco . He rates its shares “positive.”  “This drives usage of the Kindle and it opens it up to a
younger demographic,” Leung said. “People are renting video
games and movies, why not textbooks.”  Rentals can run from 30 to 360 days, with fees tied to
duration of use, Amazon said. Students can later opt to purchase
books or extend rental periods.  To rent the 10th edition of “Organic Chemistry” by T.W.
Graham Solomons and Craig Fryhle, a student would pay $42.41 for
30 days, according to Amazon’s  website . The rental cost exceeds
the $98.80 purchase price of a digital edition after the 315th
day.  Amazon fell $1.34 to $211.53 at 4:30 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The stock has gained 18 percent
this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
