Halliburton Co. (HAL) , the world’s second-
largest oilfield-services provider, said second-quarter profit
increased 54 percent as higher crude prices led to more spending
on exploration and production in  North America .  Net income rose to $739 million, or 80 cents a share, from
$480 million, or 53 cents, a year earlier, Houston-based
Halliburton said in a statement today. Excluding costs from job
cuts, the company earned 7 cents a share more than the average
of 35 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales climbed
35 percent to $5.94 billion.  Oil and natural-gas companies are expected to spend $122
billion in the U.S. this year on exploration and production, 22
percent more than last year, James Crandell and  Omar Nokta ,
analysts at Dahlman Rose & Co., wrote in a June 7 note to
investors. The average number of active U.S. oil and gas rigs
rose to 1,826 in the second quarter, up 21 percent from 1,506 a
year ago, according to Baker Hughes Inc.  “North America across the board was stronger than we
expected,” said John Lawrence, an analyst at Tudor Pickering
Holt & Co. in Houston whose firm rates the shares a “buy” and
owns none. “They checked every box -- execution, the rig count
was stronger, pricing was probably better than we thought.”  Sales in North America, Halliburton’s largest region, rose
63 percent to $3.45 billion from $2.11 billion a year earlier.
Lawrence said his firm was expecting regional sales to grow to
$3.28 billion.  North American Margin  Halliburton’s North American margin will expand at a slower
pace in the current quarter compared with the prior one, partly
because of increased costs, Chief Financial Officer Mark McCollum said on a conference call today.  A “gradual” increase in international margin is expected
in the second half, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dave Lesar said on the call.  Oil prices  rose 31 percent to average $102.34 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  in the second quarter, up from
$78.05 a year ago.  Halliburton gained 4 cents to $53.12 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares, which have 35 buy
and three hold ratings from analysts, have increased 30 percent
this year.  Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB) , the largest oilfield-services provider,
is scheduled to report earnings on July 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
