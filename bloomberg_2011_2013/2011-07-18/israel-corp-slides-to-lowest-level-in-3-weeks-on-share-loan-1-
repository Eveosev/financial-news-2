Israel Corp. fell to the lowest in
almost three weeks after Calcalist reported shareholder Idan Ofer plans to lend institutional investors shares valued at $150
million or 1.8 percent of the company.  The shares dropped 2.7 percent to 3,580 shekels at the 4:30
p.m. close in  Tel Aviv , the lowest since June 28.  Motti Scherf, a spokesman for Ofer, declined to comment on
the Calcalist report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
