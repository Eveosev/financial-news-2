A majority of respondents to a
ComRes poll for ITV News published today believe that  James Murdoch  should resign as chairman of News International.  Sixty-five percent of those surveyed agreed that Murdoch
should quit, while 9 percent disagreed, ComRes said in an e-
mailed statement.  More than half those questioned, or 57 percent, said  News
Corp. (NWSA)  Chairman  Rupert Murdoch  should be disqualified by law from
being a company director, while 83 percent want him to apologize
over the phone-hacking scandal when he appears before lawmakers
at the House of Commons Select Committee tomorrow.  Eighty percent of respondents agreed that the reputation of
all British newspapers has been “seriously called into
question,” by the scandal, the poll found, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
