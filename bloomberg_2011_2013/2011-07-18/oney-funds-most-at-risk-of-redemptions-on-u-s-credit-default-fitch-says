Money market funds  with about $1.3
trillion of U.S. government-related assets would be more at risk
from redemptions than a default by the Treasury Department,
according to  Fitch Ratings .  Funds wouldn’t be forced to sell defaulted U.S. securities
unless the sales were needed to meet investor payments, the
rating company said in a report by New York-based analysts Roger Merritt, Nathan Flanders and Viktoria Baklanova.  “The mark-to-market impact is not as concerning to us as
the scenario where there’s significant redemption activity,
which forces funds to sell into a less-than-liquid market,”
Merritt said in a telephone interview.  Fitch expects that President  Barack Obama  and Republicans
in Congress will resolve the dispute about raising the $14.3
trillion debt ceiling before the Aug. 2 deadline at which point
Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner  has said the U.S. will
exhaust capacity to borrow.  While the U.S. would be likely able to roll over its
maturing bill issues early in the month, how long that will be
possible “is still a little bit of an unknown,” Merritt said.
Coupon interest payments due Aug. 15 presents a more difficult
problem for the Treasury, and if at that point “we’re still at
a political impasse, they won’t be able to roll it over,”
Merritt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
