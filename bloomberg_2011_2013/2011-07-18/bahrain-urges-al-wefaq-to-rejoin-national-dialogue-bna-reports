Bahrain’s government has urged Al-
Wefaq, the country’s main Shiite Muslim opposition group, to
rejoin talks aimed at bridging rifts between sectarian groups
after its withdrawal yesterday.  Al-Wefaq’s contribution to the one-month national dialogue
is “central to its success,” the official  Bahrain News Agency 
reported, citing Isa Abdul Rahman, spokesman for the talks.
“Should any participant choose to exclude themselves from the
process, the door will remain open for them to return,” he was
cited as saying by the news service.  Bahrain opened the talks on July 2 following a crackdown by
the Sunni Muslim-controlled government on the mainly Shiite
protesters. King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, a Sunni, called for a
“national dialogue” in the Gulf Arab country in May, more than
two months after the end of the protests that were led by
Shiites calling for increased civil rights and democracy. About
300 people have been invited to attend the forum, which will
meet three times a week until the end of July.  “We feel that a predetermined outcome was already
planned,” Khalil al-Marzooq, a representative from  Al-Wefaq ,
said in a phone interview from Manama. “Without serious
dialogue there won’t be a solution.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
