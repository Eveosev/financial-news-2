Ghana ’s cedi strengthened as foreign
investors sold dollars before the country’s first auction of
five-year bonds since 2007 and  oil companies  bought cedis to pay
bills.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
traded at 1.5140 per dollar as of 1 p.m. in Accra, the capital,
from a closing rate of 1.5150 on July 15, according to data
compiled by the local unit of Access Bank Plc.  “We have foreign investors selling dollars today in
anticipation of the five-year bond auction by Bank of Ghana,”
Kwabena Owusu, a currency trader at the lender, said in a
telephone interview today. “Big international oil companies
were also on the market to buy cedis to pay expenses.”  The central bank set July 28 as the date for its first
five-year bond auction since June 2007, according to a
prospectus published on its website. The  Bank of Ghana  will sell
300 million cedis ($198 million) of the notes, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
