Aquamarine Power Ltd., a Scottish
marine energy company, is seeking a further 30 million pounds
($48 million) from investors over the next three years to make
its machines commercial.  “We expect to start shipping machines in 2014,” Chief
Executive Officer Martin McAdam said by telephone on July 13.  The Edinburgh-based company raised 50 million pounds from
backers including  ABB Ltd. (ABBN) , the world’s largest maker of power-
transmission gear, and  Scottish & Southern Energy Plc (SSE) , since it
was founded in 2005. Last year, Aquamarine and SSE Renewables
won a lease to generate 200 megawatts of electricity from the
waters near the Orkney Islands in northern  Scotland .  With a quarter of  Europe ’s tidal energy and a 10th of its
wave generation resources, Scotland is set to become “the  Saudi
Arabia  of marine power,” First Minister Alex Salmond has said.
Scotland already has become a global center for testing tidal
and wave power equipment, attracting companies including
 Germany ’s EON AG and the local unit of Iberdrola SA, the world’s
largest renewable energy producer.  Aquamarine’s Oyster 800, launched last week, can generate
0.8 megawatt of hydro-electric wave energy, the company said.
Aquamarine estimates that 20 Oyster 800 devices would generate
enough power for as many as 15,000 homes.  Renewable energy sources such as wind, hydro, marine,
biomass and energy from waste, currently make up about 30
percent of Scotland’s electricity need. It aims to increase that
to 100 percent by 2020. The goal for marine is 1,600 megawatts.  The 26-meter wide machine looks like a  giant barn door 
hinged at the bottom and is designed to operate near to the
shore line in a typical water depth of 14 meters, McAdam said.
Each machine currently costs 10 million pounds which should be
cut to 3 million pounds in the next five years, he said.  “The total size of the market is about 64,000 machines and
we are aiming for 3 percent of that by 2020,” he said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
