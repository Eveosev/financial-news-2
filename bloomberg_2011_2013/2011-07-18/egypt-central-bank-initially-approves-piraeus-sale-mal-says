Egypt’s Central Bank gave initial
approval for the sale of Piraeus Bank SA’s Egypt business to
 Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  and will soon set a date for due
diligence of the bank’s accounts,  Al Mal  reported without saying
how it got the information.  Standard Chartered may acquire more than a 97 percent stake
in the bank, the Cairo-based newspaper cited an unidentified
official at the Greek bank as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
