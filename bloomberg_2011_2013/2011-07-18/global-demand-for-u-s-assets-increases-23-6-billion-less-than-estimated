Global demand for U.S. stocks, bonds
and other financial assets rose in May from a month earlier as
 China  and Japan added to their holdings of government
securities, the Treasury Department reported.  Net buying of long-term equities, notes and bonds totaled
$23.6 billion during the month, compared with net buying of
$30.6 billion in April, according to statistics issued today in
Washington. Including short-term securities such as stock swaps,
foreigners sold a net $67.5 billion compared with net buying of
$66.6 billion the previous month.  The reporting on long-term securities is a gauge of
confidence in U.S. economic policy, and today’s data suggest the
country offers safety from the economic crisis in Europe even
with the White House and Congress at odds over raising the
Treasury’s borrowing authority.  “The U.S. failure to lift the debt ceiling limit has not
led America’s creditors to lose confidence yet,” said  Chris Rupkey , chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ Ltd. in  New York . “Foreigners continue to buy now, but they
may yet get cold feet.”  Economists in a Bloomberg News survey projected long-term
U.S. financial assets would show net buying of $40 billion in
May. Five economists participated in the survey, and their
estimates ranged from $30 billion to $66 billion.  The data capture international purchases of government
notes and bonds, stocks, corporate debt and securities issued by
U.S. agencies such as  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac , which buy home
mortgages.  China Biggest  China remained the biggest foreign holder of U.S.
Treasuries, as its holdings rose by $7.3 billion to $1.16
trillion in May, according to the Treasury’s statistics.  Japan , the second-largest holder, increased its holdings by
$5.5 billion to $912.4 billion in May.  Hong Kong , counted
separately from China, reduced its holdings by $500 million to
$121.9 billion.  Total foreign purchases of Treasury notes and bonds were
$38 billion in May compared with purchases of $23.3 billion in
April.  Foreign selling of U.S. agency debt was a net $8.3 billion
in May after purchases of $7.5 billion in April.  Net foreign purchases of equities were $9.3 billion in May
after net purchases of $17.8 billion in April.  Investors purchased a net $5.6 billion in U.S. corporate
debt in May after selling $3.8 billion in April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
