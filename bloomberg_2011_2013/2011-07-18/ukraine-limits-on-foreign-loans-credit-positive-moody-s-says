Ukraine’s decision to restrict
foreign-currency lending is “credit positive” for the
country’s banks, Moody’s Investors Service said today.  Parliament on July 8 reimposed restrictions on foreign-
currency lending that expired at the end of last year.  “These restrictions are credit positive for the Ukrainian
banking system as they will reduce banks’ foreign currency and
credit risks,” Yana Ruvinskaya, a Moody’s analyst, said today
in an e-mailed statement.  About 60 percent of Ukrainian bank loans were denominated
in foreign currencies at the end of 2008, Ruvinskaya said.
Problem loans equaled 40 percent of total lending at the end of
2010 as the hryvnia’s decline made it difficult for many
borrowers to repay their loans, “significantly eroding banks’
capitalization and profitability,” she said.  Foreign-currency loans now account for 46 percent of
outstanding loans, according to Moody’s.  The hryvnia fell 42 percent against the dollar from Sept.
1, 2008, to the end of 2009, making it the worst performer among
more than 170 currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The hryvnia has
weakened 0.3 percent to 7.995 per dollar this year.  Yuriy Kolobov, first deputy governor of  the Natsionalnyi
Bank Ukrainy , said May 30 that the central bank had no plans to
impose trading limits for the hryvnia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
