Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) , the largest
independent U.S. brokerage by client assets, reported second-
quarter profit that matched the average analyst estimate as
interest income offset a decline in trading.  Net income rose 16 percent to $238 million, or 20 cents a
share, from $205 million, or 17 cents, a year earlier, the San
Francisco-based company said in a statement today. Analysts
estimated profit of 20 cents a share, according to the average
in a Bloomberg survey. Net revenue climbed 10 percent to $1.19
billion, beating the average analyst projection by 0.7 percent.  The brokerage, which has been weathering a near-zero
interest rate environment since December 2008, exceeded analyst
estimates last quarter, doubling profit on interest revenue and
higher fees for managing assets. Net new assets for  Charles
Schwab  totaled $15.4 billion last quarter, compared with $14.6
billion in the same period a year ago, according to today’s
statement.  “Overall, a solid headline result,”  Ed Ditmire , a New
York-based analyst with Macquarie Group Ltd., wrote in a report
today. He said the stock will likely have a “muted response.”  The shares fell 0.3 percent to $14.97 at 4 p.m. in New York
today. They have lost 13 percent in 2011, compared with a 3.8
percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and a 17 percent
drop for the NYSE Arca Securities Broker/Dealer Index.  DARTs  Charles Schwab’s daily average revenue-generating trades
declined 13 percent last quarter from a year earlier, while the
average revenue per trade increased 1 percent, according to
today’s statement. Trading revenue, which now accounts for about
17 percent of the company’s total, fell 12 percent. Fees from
managing assets rose 15 percent and net interest revenue
increased 18 percent.  “With trading down to less than 20 percent of total
revenues here, we’re moving more and more toward that asset-
management fees number as a metric of what really drives
outcomes here from a financial perspective,” Chief Financial
Officer Joe Martinetto said in a telephone interview today.
