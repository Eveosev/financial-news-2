Fed funds, the U.S. overnight
inter-bank lending rate, opened at 0.10 percent, within the
 Federal Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.05 percent on July 15 after trading
from 0.03 percent to 0.11 percent and averaging 0.08 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an
e-mailed statement. ICAP’s monthly average is 0.071 percent.  No open market operations, which add or drain reserves to
the banking system, are expected, according to Wrightson ICAP, a
research unit of ICAP specializing in U.S. government finance.  In repos, the Fed buys  U.S. Treasury , mortgage-backed and
agency debt from its primary dealers for a set period,
temporarily raising the amount of money available in the banking
system. At maturity, the securities are returned to the dealers,
and the cash to the Fed. In reverse repos, temporary funds are
drained from the system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
