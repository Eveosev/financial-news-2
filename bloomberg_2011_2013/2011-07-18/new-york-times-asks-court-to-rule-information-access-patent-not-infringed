The  New York Times Co. (NYT)  sued a patent
holder asking for a court ruling that it doesn’t infringe a 1993
U.S. patent for accessing and assembling information.  The New York-based newspaper publisher contends patent-
owner  Webvention LLC  of Marshall,  Texas , is targeting its
 website , according to papers filed today in federal court in
Wilmington,  Delaware .  Last July, “Webvention filed a lawsuit against 19
companies” alleging infringement of the same patent, and last
October “filed another lawsuit” against 20 other companies --
and has requested $80,000 for use of the patented technology --
Times lawyers said in court papers.  The Times “does not infringe any valid claim” of the
patent, according to the lawsuit, which asks for a  jury trial 
and describes the defendant as “solely a licensing entity.”  Webvention lawyers at  the Davis Firm  in Longview, Texas,
didn’t immediately return a call for comment on the lawsuit.  The case is The New York Times Co. v. Webvention Holdings
LLC, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 5,251,294.  To contact the reporter on this story:
