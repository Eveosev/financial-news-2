Oil options volatility rose as
underlying futures slipped for the second time in three days
after concern grew that the European debt crisis is deepening,
threatening the region’s economy and fuel demand.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 30.5 percent as of 1 p.m. in  New
York , up from 28.8 percent on July 15.  “Action is just flip-flopping as oil goes up and down,”
said  James Cordier , portfolio manager at OptionSellers.com in
Tampa,  Florida . “These $2 moves lately are what’s boosting the
volatility.”  Crude for August delivery sank $1.64, or 1.7 percent, to
$95.60 a barrel at 1:55 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , after losing as much as $2.55 earlier. The September-
delivery contract dropped $1.41, or 1.4 percent, to $96.19.  The four most-active options in electronic trading were
puts, which gain value as futures prices decline.  “The crude market was so fairly priced at $95, people were
buying puts on the weakness a few weeks ago,” Cordier said.
“Last week, they were buying calls and now the puts are more
active just simply because the market is down.”  Electronic Trading  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
September $85 puts, with 1,578 lots changing hands as of 2:02
p.m. They gained 6 cents to 56 cents a barrel. September $90
puts, the next-most active option, rose 22 cents to $1.30 a
barrel with 1,273 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000
barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  September $75 puts were the most active options traded in
the previous session, with 5,144 lots changing hands. They fell
2 cents to 11 cents a barrel. The next-most active options,
March 2012 $80 puts, dropped 10 cents to $2.81 a barrel on
volume of 4,650 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
43,304 contracts. Next were December $125 calls with 41,802 and
December $100 calls with 40,307.  To contact the reporter on this story:
