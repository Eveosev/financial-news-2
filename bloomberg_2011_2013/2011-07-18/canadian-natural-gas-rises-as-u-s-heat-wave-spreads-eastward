Canadian natural gas rose on
forecasts that a heat wave in the U.S. Midwest will spread
eastward, increasing demand for the power-plant fuel.  Canadian gas prices, which usually follow their U.S.
counterparts on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, gained 1.2
percent as the U.S. National Weather Service said a “dangerous
heat wave” now over the central U.S. would expand, bringing
“excessive heat” to the mid-Atlantic region and South through
the end of next week.  Alberta gas for August delivery gained 4.25 cents to
C$3.645 per gigajoule ($3.60 per million British thermal units)
as of noon New York time, according to  NGX , a Canadian Internet
market. September gas rose 3.75 cents to C$3.635. Gas traded on
the exchange goes to users in  Canada  and the U.S. and is priced
on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas in New York advanced 2.8 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $4.574 per million Btu as of 12:10 p.m.  Cooling demand in New York will be about 42 percent more
than normal until at least July 25, said Weather Derivatives,
based in Belton, Missouri.  Power plants  use 30 percent of U.S.
gas supplies, according to the Energy Department.  The high in Indianapolis today may reach 90 degrees
Fahrenheit, 4 degrees above normal, according to AccuWeather

output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.58 billion

at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.1 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.04 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.72 billion cubic feet today, about 62
percent of its capacity of 2.76 billion.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near  Chicago 
rose 9.6 cents to $4.5556 per million Btu on July 15 on the
