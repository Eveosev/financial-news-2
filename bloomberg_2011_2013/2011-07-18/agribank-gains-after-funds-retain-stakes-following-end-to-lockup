Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (1288)  rose
to the highest in almost two weeks in Hong Kong after the July
16 expiry of a lockup period for shares held by some of its
biggest investors didn’t immediately lead to a sell-down.  The nation’s third-largest lender by market value climbed
3.3 percent to HK$4.08 as of 3:39 p.m. in Hong Kong trading,
while the benchmark  Hang Seng  index fell 0.5 percent. The gains
helped erase Agricultural Bank’s 3.4 percent loss in the two
weeks ended July 15.  A 12-month lockup period on 22 percent of Agricultural
Bank’s Hong Kong-listed shares, valued at about HK$28 billion
($3.6 billion) and held by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund,
expired last week. Similar restrictions on stakes in the
Beijing-based bank that are owned by  Kuwait Investment Authority 
and Standard Charted Plc also ended.  “Shareholders were worried cornerstone investors would
trim their stakes,” said May Yan, a Hong Kong-based analyst at
Barclays Capital. “Since the stakes remain today, the shares
have risen again.”  Yao Chunlei, a press official at Agricultural Bank in
Beijing, declined to immediately comment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
