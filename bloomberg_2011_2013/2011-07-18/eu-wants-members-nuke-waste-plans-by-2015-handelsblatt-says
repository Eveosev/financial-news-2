The European Commission wants member
states to submit plans on how to dispose of radioactive waste
from their nuclear  power plants  by 2015 at the latest,
Handelsblatt reported, citing unidentified commission officials
and diplomats.  The national plans would have to detail financing and
timetables on the construction of nuclear waste storage sites,
the newspaper said.  European Union member states’ ambassadors have approved a
draft directive, which could come into force in September if
backed by ministers, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
