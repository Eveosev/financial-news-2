Czech equities fell for a third day
to a seven-month low, led by  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  and  Komercni
Banka AS (KOMB) , as European stress tests failed to reassure investors
banks and governments can weather the region’s debt crisis.  The PX gauge of 14 companies slumped 1 percent to 1,186.7
by 4:28 p.m. in Prague, its lowest closing price since Dec. 10.
Austria’s Erste slumped 2 percent and Komercni, the Czech unit
of Societe Generale SA, decreased 0.8 percent. The two stocks
have a combined 41 percent weighting in the index.  Equities tumbled around the world and the euro weakened to
a record versus the Swiss franc amid concern officials are no
closer to solving the debt crises in  Europe  and the U.S. Shares
of European banks fell below the value of their tangible assets
for the first time in two years after last week’s stress tests
failed to ease concern the firms are vulnerable.  To contact the reporter on this story:
