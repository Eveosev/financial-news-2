Power Finance Corp.,  India ’s largest
lender to utilities, will set up a unit to fund renewable-energy
projects as the nation seeks to cut pollution from generation.  The lender, based in New Delhi, is waiting for central bank
approval for the unit to be capitalized at 12 billion rupees
($269 million), Chairman Satnam Singh said in the city today.  Power Finance approved 10 billion rupees of loans to
renewable projects such as wind farms last year. The company’s
current loans will be transferred to the new unit, Singh said.  -- With assistance from Natalie Obiko Pearson in Mumbai.
