Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  is
rolling out a bigger 1-Series compact car to reclaim the top
spot from Audi for the first time since 2008 in the competition
for younger customers purchasing entry-level luxury autos.  BMW’s smallest model will add more than 3 inches in length
and about 1 inch in width, allowing for a roomier interior and
more trunk space, the carmaker said. The vehicle’s starting
price will be 23,850 euros ($33,480) in  Germany , 900 euros more
than its predecessor, and hit European showrooms in September.  “The 1-Series has considerable strategic value for BMW,”
said  Juergen Pieper , a Frankfurt-based Bankhaus Metzler analyst
who recommends selling the shares. “It’s the gateway” for
customers in their 30s, he said.  German luxury carmakers are revamping their smallest cars
and adding compact models to entice buyers to sample their
brands. The redesigned 1-Series will compete with Audi’s A3 and
a rebuilt Mercedes-Benz B-Class coming to market this year.  The 1-Series will be the top global seller for luxury
compact vehicles in 2011 with deliveries of 210,500, compared
with 179,000 of the A3 and 114,000 of the B-Class, according to
research firm IHS Automotive. Audi, which sold 208,000 A3s in
2010, has held the top spot in the past two years. BMW delivered
195,000 of the 1-Series last year.  “We’re delighted with the ability to bring new customers
to the company with the development of the 1-Series,” sales
chief  Ian Robertson  said at a presentation of the model in
Berlin late yesterday. “This car has the youngest age profile
within the BMW group. It’s a car that’s appealing to a much
broader audience, a much younger audience.”  Fending Off Audi  Lifting 1-Series sales is part of a broader strategy at the
Munich-based carmaker to sell more than 2 million cars by 2020
and fend off advances by Audi, which aims to pass BMW as the
world’s largest maker of  luxury vehicles  by 2015. Ingolstadt,
Germany-based Audi has outsold Mercedes this year, claiming the
No. 2 position. BMW last week raised its 2011 sales outlook to
more than 1.6 million autos.  Audi’s A3 compact, which starts at 20,950 euros, continues
to benefit from “sturdy” demand and there’s no definitive date
yet for an overhaul, spokesman Moritz Drechsel said. The
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  unit’s original A3 was introduced in 1996 and the
current second generation came to market in 2003.  Daimler AG (DAI)  will pep up Mercedes’ small-car lineup with the
overhauled B-Class and three other new models. Mercedes is
replacing the boxy A-Class with a sporty hatchback and is
considering a small coupe and sport-utility vehicle. The
Stuttgart, Germany-based automaker is building an 800 million-
euro Hungarian factory and investing 600 million euros to
upgrade a German plant to expand production of the models.  New to Brand  BMW has sold 1.22 million 1-Series since its 2004
introduction, with 400,000 of those deliveries in Germany,
Robertson said. More than 70 percent of the vehicle’s owners are
new to the BMW brand, he added. The car will be shown at the
Frankfurt auto show in September, Robertson said.  Luxury-car makers are also boosting their compact offerings
as regulators mandate vehicles with lower emissions. The new 1-
Series, which relies on four-cylinder engines, burns up to 20
percent less fuel than the predecessor, said Dietmar
Zimmerhackl, the 1-Series project leader. BMW would potentially
face fines for violating CO2 emission limits without the benefit
of its smallest model, Pieper said. The new 1-Series emits
between 114 and 137 grams per kilometer.  The revamped 1-Series may be the last version with rear-
wheel powertrains before BMW switches to front-wheel-drive
technology as part of its efforts to expand compact vehicle
offerings, said  Tim Schuldt , a Frankfurt-based analyst at
Equinet AG who recommends holding BMW stock.  “The 1-Series has an unmentionable bearing on BMW’s profit
margin but it certainly is a boon to their efforts to complying
with fleet emission standards,” Schuldt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
