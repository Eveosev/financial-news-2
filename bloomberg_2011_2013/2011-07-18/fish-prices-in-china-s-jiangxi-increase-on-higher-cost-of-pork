Prices for freshwater fish in
 China ’s Jiangxi province have increased as much as 7.5 percent
on a weekly basis due to the rising cost of pork, according to
the provincial commerce department.  Carp prices on July 13 had gained 7.5 percent from a week
earlier, according to a  report  posted to the website of the
 Department of Commerce  of Jiangxi Province. Prices for Chub
gained 5.4 percent and crucian carp by 4.5 percent in the same
period, according to the report.  Demand for freshwater fishes, generally half the price of
pork, “rose significantly” in recent weeks, causing supplies
of fish to be insufficient, according to a separate  report 
posted July 13 to the website of Jiangxi price bureau. The price
of live hogs in Jiangxi reached 9.61 yuan ($1.5) for half a
kilogram by June 30, an 82 percent increase from a year earlier,
the Jiangxi price bureau said in its report.  --Emma Dong. Editor:  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
