Cyprus Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou said he tendered his resignation to President Demetris Christofias following last week’s explosion at a naval base.  “I asked the president to relieve me of my post not
because there is a sense of guilt but because of political
sensitivity,” Kyprianou told reporters in Nicosia today. “I
refuse to serve the games of those aiming to destroy political
opponents instead of finding the true perpetrators.”  Government spokesman  Stefanos Stefanou  confirmed to
reporters that Kyprianou had submitted his resignation. He
didn’t say whether it was accepted by the President.  Protestors have demanded Kyprianou’s and Christofias’s
resignations in island-wide demonstrations over the past week,
following the July 11 explosion of munitions at a naval base
that killed 13, injured 61 and knocked out a power plant that
represented about half of the island’s power capacity.  The munitions were seized in 2009 from the Russian-owned,
Cypriot-flagged vessel Monchegorsk. The U.S., Britain and  France 
said at the time the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines
chartered the vessel to send weapons-related material, including
what they described as “bullet shells” and anti-tank
munitions, to  Syria . Iran said the seizure was illegal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
