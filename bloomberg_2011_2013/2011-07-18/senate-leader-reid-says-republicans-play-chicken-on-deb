Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid ,
noting that Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner  has warned of
disastrous consequences if the U.S. defaults on its obligations
to bondholders, said some Republicans are “playing chicken”
with the debt-limit debate.  Reid said Geithner warned Senate Democrats last week that
failing to raise the U.S. debt limit by an Aug. 2 deadline would
hamstring an economy struggling to recover from the worst
recession since the Great Depression.  “It will make what we just went through look like a quaint
little crisis,” Reid said on the Senate floor.  Reid and Republican Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell  will
push a revised budget plan this week aimed at allowing a debt-
limit increase to avoid a government default as President Barack Obama presses for action before the deadline.  To contact the reporters on this story:
