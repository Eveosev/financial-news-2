U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
will today warn British businesses that they will miss out on
“one of the greatest economic opportunities on the planet” if
they do not engage in trade and investment in  Africa .  While the U.K. is delivering a 52 million-pound ($84
million) package of aid to the drought-stricken areas of Kenya,
Somalia and Ethiopia, the hope for Africa’s future will come
from its people’s driving economic growth and fostering the full
implications of democracy, Cameron will say in a speech in
Lagos,  Nigeria , today.  “This can be Africa’s moment, Africa is transforming in a
way no one thought possible 20 years ago, and suddenly a whole
new future seems within reach,” Cameron will say, according to
extracts of his speech released by his office  “ Aid, trade, democracy, these are the three things we
need, these are the ways Africa will meet its moment of
opportunity.” Six of the 10 fastest growing economies in the
world are in Africa, Cameron will tell his audience, and, if the
continent works with partners in the west to tackle war and
disease, it can join  Brazil , Indonesia and  China  in lifting
millions out of poverty through private enterprise and trade.  An African Free Trade Area could lead to an increase in GDP
of as much as $6 billion a year across the continent, the prime
minister will say, adding that British businesses risk missing
out if they do not seize the opportunity for trade and
investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
