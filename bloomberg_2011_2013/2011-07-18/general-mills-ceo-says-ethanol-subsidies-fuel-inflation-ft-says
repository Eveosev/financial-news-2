General Mills Inc. (GIS)  Chief Executive
Officer Ken Powell said U.S. ethanol fuel subsidies were causing
higher food prices, in turn increasing inflation, the Financial
Times reported, citing an interview with him.  General Mills is the world’s sixth-largest food producer by
revenue, and Powell said if corn prices rise, wheat would
follow, and “it’s all linked,” the FT reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
