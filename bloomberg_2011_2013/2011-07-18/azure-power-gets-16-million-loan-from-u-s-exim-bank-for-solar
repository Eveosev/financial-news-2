The U.S. Export-Import Bank approved
about $25 million in loans for two solar projects in India that
will buy devices from  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  and Abound Solar Inc.  The bank will provide a $9.2 million loan to  Punj Lloyd
Ltd. (PUNJ) , a New Delhi-based engineering company, for 18 years,
according to an e-mailed statement today. It also approved a $16
million loan to Azure Power, an Indian solar developer backed by
the  World Bank , for 16 1/2 years.  Punj Lloyd will use solar photovoltaic panels from
Loveland, Colorado-based Abound Solar, while Azure Power will
use thin-film modules from First Solar. Both developers are
building 5-megawatt projects in western Rajasthan state.  The Export-Import Bank helps exporters get credit for
foreign sales by providing direct loans or guarantees to banks
that will be repaid. It has granted $75 million in funds for
four Indian solar projects and has $500 million in the pipeline,
supporting 315 megawatts of solar plants.  First Solar, based in Tempe,  Arizona , is the largest maker
of thin-film panels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
