Canadian stocks fell, led by
financial and energy companies, as bank stress tests failed to
reassure investors the European debt crisis will be contained
and oil futures dropped.  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) ,  Canada ’s third-largest lender by
assets, declined 1.9 percent as financial stocks fell after the
weekend passed with no agreement among U.S. lawmakers to raise
the country’s debt ceiling.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , Canada’s biggest
energy company, lost 1.2 percent.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the
world’s biggest gold producer, advanced 1.9 percent as the metal
climbed above $1,600 an ounce for the first time.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index decreased 45.4
points, or 0.3 percent, to 13,254.14.  “The European thing has been scaring the heck out of
everybody,” Gerry Brockelsby, a money manager at Marquest Asset
Management Inc. in Toronto, which oversees C$250 million ($261
million), said in a telephone interview. “This debt-ceiling
limit is now front and center in the States. That’s doing a
pretty good job of scaring the wits out of everyone.”  The S&P/TSX was almost unchanged this month through July
15, slipping less than 0.1 percent, as financial stocks
retreated and precious-metals producers rallied on concern the
European debt crisis will spread beyond  Greece . Among developed-
market stock benchmarks, only those of  Japan , Israel and Denmark
gained during the period as Italian and Spanish government bond
yields approached the levels that forced Greece, Ireland and
Portugal to seek bailouts.  Italian, Spanish and Greek bond yields increased today
after the European Bank Authority said July 15 that 8 out of 90
banks it examined failed its stress tests. The regulators didn’t
include the impact of a Greek default in the assessments.  Scotiabank, Manulife  The S&P/TSX Financials Index fell to the lowest level since
January. Scotiabank dropped 1.9 percent to C$56.  Manulife
Financial Corp. (MFC) , North America’s fourth-largest insurer,
declined 2.6 percent to C$15.57.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s biggest lender by
assets, slipped 1.1 percent to C$52.45. The shares haven’t
gained in 10 days, the longest such streak since 1999.  Oil decreased 1.4 percent in  New York . Suncor fell 1.2
percent to C$37.55.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , Canada’s
second-largest oil and gas producer by market value, retreated
0.7 percent to C$39.49. TransCanada Corp., the owner of the
country’s biggest pipeline system, fell 0.8 percent to C$40.11.  Gold climbed for a 10th day in New York to extend its
streak of gains to the longest in 31 years. Silver rallied 3.3
percent.  Mining Shares  Barrick rose 1.9 percent to C$47.03.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the
world’s second-largest gold producer by market value, gained 2.3
percent to C$52.79.  Silver Wheaton Corp. (SLW) , Canada’s fourth-
biggest precious-metals company by market value, advanced 2.9
percent to C$38.05. First Majestic Silver Corp, which mines in
 Mexico , surged 9.4 percent to C$23.48.  Canfor Corp. (CFP) , the country’s second-largest forestry
company, jumped 9.7 percent, the most since November 2009, to
C$10.70 after analysts at Royal Bank and Raymond James Financial
Inc. raised their ratings on the stock.  Daryl Swetlishoff, an analyst at Raymond James, boosted his
rating on Canfor to “outperform” from “market perform,”
citing valuation, after the shares plunged 36 percent from April
1 to yesterday.  Sino-Forest  Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE) , the forestry company fighting a short
seller’s assertions of financial manipulation, dropped for a
seventh day, the longest streak since December 2009, sinking 13
percent to C$3.53. Sino-Forest has tumbled 33 percent since July
5, the day before the company  canceled  a site visit for
analysts.  Neo Material Technologies Inc. (NEM) , which makes rare-earths and
zirconium products, slumped 5.4 percent to C$8.54 after Kyodo
quoted Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming as saying the
country is studying measures to address “speculative price
movements” of rare earths.  Imax Corp. (IMAX) , the maker of giant-screen movie-projection
systems, retreated 5.8 percent to C$25.86. Imax showings of the
film “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2” brought in
less revenue per screen than the previous film in the franchise,
