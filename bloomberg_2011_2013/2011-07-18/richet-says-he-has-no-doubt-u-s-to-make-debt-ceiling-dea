European Central Bank  President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  has “no doubt” U.S. authorities will find
a compromise solution to lift the country’s debt ceiling, he
said in a joint interview with Estonian, Slovakian and Slovenian
newspapers.  “I have no doubt that the U.S. authorities will find an
appropriate way to cope with the present difficulties and that
they will succeed,” Trichet said, according to a transcript of
an interview with Estonia’s Postimees, Slovakia’s Hospodarske
noviny and Delo of Slovenia. “If not, it would create a problem
of great magnitude for the entire world.”  Trichet said he is “fully confident” that Italy can
reinforce “credibility” and reiterated that the ECB rejects
any solution to  Greece ’s debt crisis that involves default,
selective default or a  credit event .  To contact the reporter on this story:
