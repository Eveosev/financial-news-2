Colombia ’s peso bonds fell, pushing
yields higher by the most in two weeks, on bets the central bank
will raise the benchmark lending rate to 4.5 percent at a
meeting next week from 4.25 percent.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 rose
8 basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 7.85 percent at
10:54 a.m. New York time, for the biggest increase since July 1,
according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price fell 0.721
centavos to 117.184 centavos per peso, the lowest price since
July 1.  “The central bank has a lot of space to increase  interest
rates  so it can keep inflation from rising in coming years,”
said Jose Luis Alayon, an analyst at Acciones y Valores SA. “It
is expected that in the coming meeting they will increase rates
by another 0.25” percentage point.  Investors are betting the bank will raise the benchmark
rate to 4.5 percent at the July 29 meeting, Alayon said.
Economists expect the bank to raise the rate to 5 percent by
year-end, according to the average estimate in a central bank
survey of 42 economists published July 11.  Economists also raised their 2011 inflation forecast for a
second month as the economy’s expansion quickens. Consumer
prices will rise 3.3 percent this year, up from a forecast of
3.2 percent in June and 3.1 percent in May, according to the
average estimate.  Colombia’s peso fell 0.1 percent to 1,759.06 per  U.S.
dollar , from 1,758.06 on July 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
