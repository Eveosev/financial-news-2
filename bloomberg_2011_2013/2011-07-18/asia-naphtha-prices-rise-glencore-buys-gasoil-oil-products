Prices of naphtha cargoes in  Asia 
rose. Glencore International AG bought gasoil for a 10th day in
Singapore, the region’s biggest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  Naphtha for delivery in the first half of October traded at
$978 a metric ton, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
traders monitoring transactions on the Platts window. BP Plc
sold 25,000 tons to Trafigura Beheer BV, while Mabanaft Gmbh &
Co. sold 25,000 tons to Cargill Inc. Prices are higher than the
$972 a ton paid for a second-half September cargo on July 14.  Cargoes of 95-RON gasoline traded at $124 to $124.80 a
barrel, the survey showed. Total SA sold 50,000 barrels to Vitol
Group. The Paris-based refiner also bought 50,000 barrels from
Trafigura.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures rose
to $109.64 a ton at 4 p.m.  Singapore  time from $91.14 a ton at
the end of Asian trading yesterday, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Middle Distillates  Glencore brought its purchases of 0.5 percent sulfur
gasoil, or diesel, to 14 cargoes totaling 2.65 million barrels
since July 5, the survey showed. The world’s largest commodities
trader received a discount of 20 cents a barrel from sellers
Vitol and Total.  Hin Leong Trading Pte bought 250,000 barrels of gasoil from
Royal Dutch Shell Plc at minus 40 cents a barrel, the survey
showed. The Singapore trader has purchased 2.9 million barrels
so far this month.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude increased
45 cents to $19.18 a barrel at 2:12 p.m. Singapore time,
according to PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a
measure of refining profit, is the widest since June 20.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil gained 10 cents to $1.20 a
barrel, the highest since June 21, PVM said. A widening regrade
shows it’s profitable to produce  aviation fuel .  Fuel Oil  Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd. brought its sales of 180-
centistoke fuel oil this month to 20 cargoes totaling 485,000
tons, according to the survey. The Hong Kong trader sold 40,000
tons to Shell at $1.50 a ton over benchmark quotes and three
23,000-ton cargoes to BP at between $674.50 and $675 a ton.  Hin Leong bought two 20,000-ton cargoes of 380-centistoke
fuel oil at $4 a ton over benchmark quotes, the survey showed.
Brightoil and ConocoPhillips each sold one cargo.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened 24 cents to
$7.60 a barrel at 2:12 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM. A
bigger gap signals growing losses for refiners turning oil into
residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke  fuel oil  to 380-centistoke
grade was unchanged after rising to $10, PVM said. This
viscosity spread widened 14 percent last week, meaning bunker,
or marine fuel, has climbed less than higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
