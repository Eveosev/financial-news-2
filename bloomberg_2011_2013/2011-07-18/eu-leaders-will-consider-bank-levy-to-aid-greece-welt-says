Euro region leaders meeting this
week in Brussels will consider combining a special bank levy
with a bond buyback program in a second aid package for  Greece ,
Die Welt reported today, without saying where it got the
information.  The fee would have to be paid not only by banks doing
business with Greece, the newspaper said in its print edition.
Investors would be asked to sell their bonds back to the Greek
government and accept losses of as much as 40 percent, depending
on maturities, the newspaper said, citing calculations by the
Berlin-based  Finance Ministry  that estimate a debt cut by 20
billion euros ($28.1 billion) from bond buybacks.  Germany ’s proposal to ask investors to roll over Greek debt
is seen as too risky as it may involve a temporary default and
is unlikely to be considered, the newspaper said. The July 21
meeting in Brussels is to take basic decisions on the shape of
the second aid package for Greece, it said.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  is resisting calls by Finance
Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  -- made behind closed doors -- to
cut Greece’s debt in a way that wouldn’t necessarily be
voluntary for bondholders as she’s worried about the debt crisis
spreading to other countries, Die Welt said.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
