The pound fell for a second day
against the dollar as a report showed U.K. house prices declined
in July for the first time this year.  Britain’s currency climbed to the strongest level in a
month versus the euro on concern that the debt crisis in the 17-
nation currency region is intensifying. U.K. home sellers
lowered asking prices by 1.6 percent from June when they gained
0.56 percent, Rightmove Plc, the U.K.’s biggest property
website, said today.  The pound traded declined 0.3 percent to $1.6089 as of 7:40
a.m. in  London . It was 0.5 percent stronger at 87.25 pence per
euro, the strongest since June 16.  Sterling has dropped 6.8 percent in the last 12 months
against nine developed-market peers tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, the second biggest
decline after the dollar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
