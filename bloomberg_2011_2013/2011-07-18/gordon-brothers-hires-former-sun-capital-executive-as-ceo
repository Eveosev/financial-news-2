Gordon Brothers  Group, the
liquidation, lending and investment firm, has named a former
executive at Sun Capital Partners as its new head.  Gary Talarico, who ran Sun’s New York and Tokyo offices, is
the new chief executive officer at the Boston-based firm, the
company said in a release. Talarico replaces Michael Frieze, a
grandson of one of the founding brothers, who will now serve as
chairman.  Gordon Brothers has been involved in some of the largest
distressed retail cases in recent years, including the
liquidation of Circuit City Stores Inc. and purchases of
bankrupt companies including Polaroid Corp. and Linens n’ Things
Inc., often partnering with other firms. It is also one of the
opening bidders for  Borders Group Inc. (BGP) , the bankrupt bookstore
chain that will auction its assets on July 19.  Talarico spent two decades as an executive at Deutsche Bank
and  Lehman Brothers  before joining Sun Capital Partners from
2004 to 2009, where his deals included the acquisition of the
Boston Market and Friendly’s restaurant chains. He comes to
Gordon Brothers from Cora Street Partners, a New York advisory
firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
