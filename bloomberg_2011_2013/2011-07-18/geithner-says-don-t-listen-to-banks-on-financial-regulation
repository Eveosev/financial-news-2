U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said “don’t listen to banks” that blame unfinished
financial rules for not being able to lend money.  “Don’t listen to banks about this kind of question because
their interests are not aligned perfectly with the broad
interests of the American economy,” Geithner said in an
interview on CNBC today. “Their job is to evade, or avoid, or
weaken, any constraints on their ability to operate. Our job is
to try to make sure we’re protecting the American economy from
the risks they inevitably take.”  “We’re going to be very careful to make sure we get these
rules right, and we’re going to take as much time as we need to
get them right,” Geithner said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
