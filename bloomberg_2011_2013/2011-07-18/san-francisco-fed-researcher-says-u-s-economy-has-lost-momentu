The  U.S. economy  has lost momentum
and will expand 2.6 percent this year, a percentage point less
than a forecast made in March, said a researcher with the
Federal Reserve Bank of  San Francisco .  The bank cut its projection amid signs that some of the
recent slowdown is “persistent,” Mary Daly, vice president and
head of the applied microeconomic research department, said in a
July 14 paper posted on the bank’s Web site today. The bank also
lowered its 2012 estimate for growth to 3.3 percent, calculated
on a fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter basis.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told Congress last week that
the central bank is prepared to take further action if the
economy appears to be in danger of stalling, and yet isn’t ready
to embark on a third round of government bond-buying. Much of
the economy’s slowdown should prove to be temporary as commodity
prices stabilize and supply disruptions from  Japan ’s earthquake
ease, Daly said.  “On net, the easing of some of the economic headwinds
combined with an apparent stabilization of the housing market
should allow growth to pick up in coming quarters,” she wrote.
“Although we expect the economy to gain additional momentum in
2012, evidence suggests that some of the recent weakness is
persistent.”  At the same time, deteriorating skills will limit the
ability of some of the long-term unemployed to find jobs, the
economist said. Structural unemployment will remain above pre-
crisis levels “for some time,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
