Gold exports from  Tanzania , which
vies with Mali to be  Africa ’s third-biggest producer of the
metal, increased 21 percent in the year through May, the central
bank said.  Shipments grew to $1.7 billion from $1.4 billion a year
earlier, the Bank of Tanzania said in an e-mailed report in Dar
es Salaam, the commercial capital, yesterday.  The value of all exports from East Africa’s second-biggest
economy climbed $1.4 billion to $6.4 billion in the year, it
said. Imports swelled to $9.7 billion, a $1.5 billion increase,
according to the report.  The country’s current account deficit widened 3.6 percent
to $2.6 billion in the period.  “This was mainly on account of rise in imports of goods and
services that outweighed the increase in exports of goods and
services and official current transfers,” it said.  Tanzania’s foreign reserves amounted to $3.6 billion by the
end of May, sufficient to cover 4.4 months of imports, while the
national debt decreased to $11.4 billion in the period, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
