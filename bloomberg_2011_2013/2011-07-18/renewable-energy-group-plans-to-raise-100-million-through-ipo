Renewable Energy  Group Inc., the
largest U.S. biodiesel producer, is seeking to raise as much as
$100 million through an initial public offering to acquire a
production facility and expand abroad.  The company plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq Stock
Market under the ticker REGI, Ames, Iowa-based Renewable Energy
said today in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. It has not determined how many shares it will offer
or their price.  Renewable Energy said it expects to use about $12 million
of the proceeds from the offering to purchase a plant in Seneca,
Illinois, that it currently leases. It owns all its other
manufacturing facilities, in Iowa, Minnesota,  Texas  and
Illinois, and three partially completed plants in Louisiana,
Kansas and New Mexico.  The company also said it plans to expand into  Europe ,  South
America  and Asia, and may use the funds for acquisitions or
joint ventures in biofuels or renewable chemicals production and
distribution.  Renewable Energy Group makes biodiesel from animal fat,
used cooking oil, inedible corn oil and other vegetable oils. It
sold almost 68 million gallons (258 million liters) in 2010,
about 22 percent of total U.S. biodiesel production, according
to the filing. The companyâ€™s facilities have a combined
production capacity of 212 million gallons a year.  UBS Securities LLC and Piper Jaffray & Co. will be joint
book-running managers for the offering, and Stifel, Nicolaus &
Company Inc. and Canaccord Genuity Inc. will be co-managers, the
company said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
