Italian and Spanish 10-year bond
yields surged to euro-era records while German bunds rallied as
contagion from the sovereign-debt crisis spread, piling pressure
on Europe’s leaders to find measures to contain the turmoil.  Yields on two-year Greek, Irish and Portuguese debt also
reached the highest since the introduction of the 17-nation
shared currency, while benchmark bund yields sank to within 12
basis points of an eight-month low. European Central Bank
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  reiterated his opposition to Greek
debt restructuring as euro-area leaders prepared to meet in
Brussels on July 21. Stocks fell on concern European banks may
need to raise as much as 80 billion euros ($113 billion) of
capital following stress tests on the lenders last week.  “It does not seem as if we are going to see an immediate
solution to the debt crisis, so investors prefer to stay on the
cautious side, and this is being reflected in German bunds,”
said  Kornelius Purps , a fixed-income strategist at UniCredit SpA
in Munich. “There is no genuine reason to price Italy and  Spain 
down. It’s general contagion. It’s an alarming signal to
European leaders to come up with a solution that doesn’t create
more contagion.”  Yields on 10-year Italian bonds increased 21 basis points
to 5.96 percent as of 4:31 p.m. in  London . Earlier, they surged
to 6.03 percent, surpassing last week’s 6.02 percent peak, to
reach the highest level since 1997. The spread, or yield gap,
over benchmark German bunds widened to 331 basis points. The
4.75 percent Italian security due September 2021 fell 1.44, or
14.40 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 91.50. Two-year
Italian yields climbed 30 basis points to 4.52 percent.  Spanish Yields, Bunds  Spanish 10-year yields rose 26 basis points to 6.33
percent, after reaching a euro-era record of 6.37 percent. The
rise in Spain’s yields took the spread over bunds to 369 basis
points. Greek two-year note yields surged 291 basis points to
35.98 percent, also a euro-era record.  Ireland’s two-year note yield reached 23.31 percent, while
 Portugal ’s soared to 20.34 percent.  The 10-year German bund yield declined five basis points to
2.65 percent, after reaching 2.62 percent. The yield fell to
2.50 percent on July 12, the least since Nov. 12. Yields on two-
year notes declined two basis points to 1.20 percent. It reached
1.05 percent on July 12, the least since Jan. 13.  Trichet Comment  Yields on the debt of so-called peripheral euro-area
nations has soared, while German bunds have rallied, as European
politicians clash over how to solve the region’s debt woes. The
disagreement centers on whether a second Greek rescue plan
should compel private holders of the Mediterranean nation’s debt
to contribute toward bailout costs, a measure that ratings
companies have warned would constitute a default.  Trichet told the Financial Times Deutschland in an
interview published over the past weekend that  Europe  can
surmount the crisis and that the euro remains “a highly
credible currency.” He reiterated that the ECB will not accept
bonds from a nation that defaults as collateral.  “In the eyes of the Governing Council, this would impair
our ability to be an anchor of confidence and stability,”
Trichet said, according to a transcript of the interview
released yesterday by the Frankfurt-based ECB.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 1.8 percent, taking its
slump from this year’s high in February to 10 percent, a decline
that strategists define as a correction. Treasuries advanced,
while the euro fell the most in almost a week against the
dollar, shedding 1 percent.  Stress Tests  The eight banks that failed stress tests among 90 that were
assessed by the European Banking Authority have a combined
capital shortfall of 2.5 billion euros, the regulator said in a
July 15 report. As many as 20 banks need to bolster capital by
as much as 80 billion euros, JPMorgan Cazenove analysts led by
 Kian Abouhossein  wrote in a note after the tests’ release.  France  and  Germany  led an increase in the cost of insuring
against default on European sovereign debt, prices from CMA
showed. Credit-default swaps on France surged 9 basis points to
a record 123 and Germany climbed 5 to 65 in London, the highest
since March 2009.  Contracts on  Greece  jumped 77 basis points to 2,492,
signaling an 88 percent probability of default within five
years. Ireland climbed 41 basis points to 1,175, Italy increased
17 to 323 and Portugal rose 36 to 1,182, while Belgium was 9
higher at 214 and Spain was up 19 at 368, the highest since
November.  The yield difference between French 10-year bonds and
similar-maturity benchmark German bonds widened three basis
points to 71 basis points. It has climbed from 38 basis points
at the start of the month.  ‘Sentiment Doubtful’  “As long as sentiment remains doubtful, then there is a
risk of further spread-widening,” Purps said. “If sentiment
improves then there is potential for massive spread-tightening,
particularly in Spain and  Italy , but also in the other European
countries, like France, where spreads have been widening.”  Markets were further roiled by U.S. President  Barack Obama ’s July 15 admission that rival Republicans and Democrats
are “running out of time” to resolve an impasse on how to
balance the federal budget and raise the $14.3 trillion debt
ceiling before an Aug. 2 deadline.  Standard & Poor’s  last week said that there’s at least a 50
percent chance it will cut the U.S.’s AAA rating by one or two
notches into the AA category within 90 days should the nation’s
politicians fail to agree on how to lower the deficit.  German  government bonds  have handed investors 2.2 percent
this year, while U.S. Treasuries have returned 3.7 percent,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian bonds have
lost 3.2 percent, while Spain’s have declined 0.3 percent, the
indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
