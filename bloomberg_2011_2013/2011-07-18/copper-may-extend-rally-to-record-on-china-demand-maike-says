Copper may rally to a record $12,000
a metric ton in the first quarter as stronger-than-expected
demand from  China , the largest user, and tumbling inventories
spur imports, according to Maike Futures Co.  “If Chinese imports don’t pick up in the second half,
there will certainly be a serious shortage,” Ren Gang, head of
Maike’s research department, said in an interview. “Destocking
is nearing the end.” The brokerage’s affiliate Xi’an Maike
Metal International Group Co. trades up to 500,000 tons of
metals and minerals a year, according to the company’s website.  Higher demand from China may extend a 49 percent rally in
London copper prices amid expectations for global consumption to
exceed supply. Imports of copper and products by China rebounded
for the first time in three months in June after stockpiles
tumbled 38 percent from this year’s high. Increased  government
investment  on infrastructure projects and affordable housing may
also boost demand.  “Besides the traditional demand from power grids,
development of high-speed railways, subways, wind and hydro
 power plants  add more demand,” said Wang Jun, an analyst at
metals researcher Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  Total investment in the power sector may surge 66 percent
to 5.3 trillion yuan ($820 billion) in the 2011-2015 period from
the previous five years, said Wang Qiankun, a researcher at the
State Grid Energy Research Institute. That investment may
require 25 million tons of copper, Wang said. The power industry
accounted for half of China’s copper consumption in 2010,
according to Antaike.  Price Gains  “I expect copper to touch $11,000 in the fourth quarter,
and maybe $12,000 in the first quarter next year,” said Maike’s
Ren. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange gained 0.2
percent to $9,694.25 a ton at 10:20 a.m. in  Shanghai . It reached
a record $10,190 on Feb. 15.  Based on downstream growth, copper demand in China could
rise by almost 20 percent this year, said Ren. Still, the high
price may damp consumption and trigger substitution, paring the
increase to 10 percent, Ren said.  Copper consumption may grow 6.5 percent to 6.7 million tons
this year, Standard Bank Plc said in a report on July 12. Demand
may expand by at least 8 percent, said Cai Jinrong, a researcher
at metals trader Wanxiang Resources Co. The global market faces
a deficit of 377,000 tons in 2011, according to the
 International Copper Study Group .  China’s gross domestic product rose 9.5 percent in the
second quarter, exceeding economists’ median forecast of 9.3
percent, after a 9.7 percent rise in the first quarter.
Industrial output advanced 15.1 percent in June, the most since
May 2010.  Housing Investment  China is on track to grow about 9 percent, boosted by local
government investment, said Chang Jian, an economist at  Barclays
Capital . The expansion last quarter came even after the central
bank boosted lending rates five times since mid-October and
lifted bank reserve requirements to a record.  “Affordable housing starts will help China achieve a soft-
landing this year, while at the same time providing space for
demand expansion next year,” Ren said.  The nation started building more than 5 million units of
affordable housing as of the end of June, exceeding half of the
government’s full-year target, and more than 4 million units are
expected to be completed within the year, Xinhua News Agency
reported on July 14.  Imports Rebound  The world’s largest metals and minerals consumer imported
1.7 million tons of unwrought copper and products in the first
half, 24 percent lower than a year ago, according to the General
Administration of Customs. Imports rose 10 percent in June from
the previous month to 280,009 tons as buying from overseas
became profitable and supply tightened.  Bonded warehouse inventories of copper are expected to fall
by 450,000 tons this year from about 600,000 tons at the end of
March, according to Ren’s estimates. About 400,000 tons of
refined copper and products will be bought from commercial
warehouses, according Ren.  Inventories at the Shanghai Futures Exchange-monitored
warehouses were 109,461 tons last week, compared with this
year’s high of 177,365 tons, according to the bourse data.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
