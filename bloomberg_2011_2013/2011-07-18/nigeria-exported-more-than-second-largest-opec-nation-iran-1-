Nigeria ,  Africa ’s top oil producer,
surpassed Iran as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries’ second-largest exporter in 2010 as security improved
in the African nation and as Iran used more crude at home.  Nigeria shipped 2.464 million barrels a day last year,
followed by Iran with 2.248 million barrels, according to OPEC’s
 Annual Statistical Bulletin  published today on its website.
Iran’s refining capacity rose by 18 percent last year, the
biggest gain among OPEC’s 12 members, the report showed.  Energy companies in Nigeria stepped up oil output as
militant attacks on installations in the Niger River delta
dropped after a government amnesty to fighters in late 2009, the
Department of Petroleum Resources said. Nigeria’s oil exports
rose 46 percent to 9.15 trillion naira ($59 billion) last year,
the National Bureau of Statistics said in April. Attacks by
armed groups in the Niger delta region, home to the nation’s
energy industry, cut more than 28 percent of oil production from
2006 to 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Iran’s crude processing capacity increased to 1.741 million
barrels a day, from 1.474 million, as facilities in Abadan,
Arak, Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, Lavan and Bandar Abbas were
expanded, compared with 2009, the data showed. In neighboring
 Iraq , refining capacity declined.  Second-Biggest  Nigeria shipped 2.16 million barrels a day in 2009 and Iran
exported 2.232 million, according to the report. Iran was OPEC’s
second-biggest producer last year, supplying 3.54 million
barrels. Nigeria was the seventh-largest with 2.048 million.  Saudi Arabia , OPEC’s biggest member, exported 6.644 million
barrels a day of crude last year, of which 64 percent was sent
to the Asia and Pacific region. It produced 8.165 million
barrels, less than its 2009 output of 8.184 million barrels.  Of OPEC’s 12 members, Iraq, Qatar,  Algeria ,  Libya , Angola
and  Venezuela  exported less in 2010 than a year earlier. All
those countries except Iraq also produced less in 2010.  OPEC production averaged 29.183 million barrels a day in
2010, an increase of less than 1 percent of the 28.927 million
barrels a day it supplied in 2009, the bulletin showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
