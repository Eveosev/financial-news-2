Defense Secretary  Liam Fox  said he
will lower troop numbers in the British army by 17,000.  Fox will seek to cut an extra 10,000 army personnel beyond
the 7,000 reduction planned in October’s defense review, the
Ministry of Defense said. The cuts involve bringing home troops
stationed in  Germany  and will allow Fox to use the money saved
to fund the procurement of equipment.  Prime Minister David Cameron’s coalition government blames
the previous Labour administration for creating a 38 billion-
pound ($61 billion) shortfall in the defense budget. Defense
spending is being cut, even though the U.K. is engaged in two
separate conflicts, as the government seeks to balance the
public finances.  “Commitments must match resources in order to achieve a
balanced budget,” Fox told Parliament in  London  today. The army
will make greater use of reservists to bolster permanent troop
levels, he said.  Jim Murphy, who speaks on defense matters for the
opposition Labour Party, said the army had been “slashed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
