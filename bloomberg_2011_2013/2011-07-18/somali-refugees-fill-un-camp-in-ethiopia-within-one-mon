A refugee camp opened on the
Somalia- Ethiopia  border at the end of June is already full,
forcing the  United Nations  to build another one, the UN’s Office
for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.  As many as 2,000 Somalis fleeing war and drought are
arriving each day at three camps in Dolo Odo region of southern
Ethiopia, the UN said in an e-mailed statement today. Work on a
fourth camp to hold as many as 40,000 people is under way.  “The dire situation in Somalia continues to push an
increasing number of refugees into neighboring countries,” the
UN said in the statement. “The condition of the new arrivals is
of great concern: many refugees are arriving in a very weak
state, with up to 45 percent of children suffering from
malnutrition.”  Somalia  is suffering from drought compounded by ongoing
conflict between the Western-backed Transitional Federal
Government and al-Qaeda-affiliated insurgents.  The United Nations’ refugee agency said on July 8 that it
was unable to cope with the influx of refugees. It has launched
a global appeal for the Horn of  Africa , with $62.7 million
needed for the Ethiopian camps.  As many as 10 million drought-affected people across
Ethiopia, Somalia, Djibouti, Kenya and Uganda will need food
aid, the UN’s World Food Programme said on July 8.  Somalia hasn’t had a functioning government since the
overthrow of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
