New York  leads the U.S. as the most
expensive state for mortgage closing costs, with average fees to
buy a home rising 10 percent from last year, Bankrate Inc. said.  Origination and title costs on a $200,000 mortgage in New
York average $6,183, compared with $5,623 in 2010, according to
an annual survey released by Bankrate today. Nationwide, closing
costs on the same-sized loan average $4,070, up 8.8 percent from
a year ago, the North Palm Beach, Florida-based company said.  The rise in closing costs follows stricter bank lending and
regulations imposed after the housing crisis, said  Greg McBride ,
senior financial analyst for Bankrate.  Fannie Mae  and Freddie
Mac, the largest U.S. mortgage-finance companies, have tightened
more than a dozen loan qualifications since being seized by the
government in 2008, and proposed rules under the Dodd-Frank Act
may further tighten weaknesses in the mortgage system.  “Increased regulation is driving up costs for lenders, and
those costs ultimately get passed on to borrowers,” McBride
said in a telephone interview. “The amount of diligence in
underwriting is certainly warranted after the collapse, but it
comes at a higher cost.”  Texas  is the second-priciest state in the U.S. to close a
mortgage. Costs there average $4,944, a 5 percent rise from
$4,708 last year. Utah was third, at $4,906.  New York and Texas have held the top spots for five years,
Bankrate said.  The cheapest places for closing costs are  Arkansas ,  North
Carolina  and  Indiana , according to Bankrate. Arkansas fees total
$3,378, with North Carolina at $3,410 and Indiana at $3,430.  Closing costs include fees charged by lenders, as well as
third-party fees for services such as appraisals and title
insurance. The survey excludes taxes, property insurance,
association fees, interest and other prepaid items.  Bankrate surveyed as many as 10 lenders in each state in
June, and obtained online estimates for a $200,000 mortgage to
buy a single-family home with a 20 percent down payment. The
good-faith estimates weren’t necessarily what borrowers actually
paid when their loans closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
