Indonesia ’s rupiah declined for a
second day as concern mounted Europe’s debt crisis will deepen,
reducing demand for higher-yielding emerging market assets.
Bonds fell.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional shares dropped as
European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  reiterated
that the ECB won’t accept as collateral bonds from a nation that
defaults. European leaders will hold a special summit on July 21
for efforts to halt the debt crisis, European Union President
 Herman Van Rompuy  said on July 15.  “Like other Asian currencies, the rupiah weakness is
coming from Europe’s debt crisis,” said Mika Martumpal, a
currency analyst at PT Bank Commonwealth in Jakarta. “This
weakness may be temporary as it is linked to  Europe . Indonesia’s
economic fundamentals are strong.”  The rupiah dropped 0.2 percent to 8,558 against the dollar
as of 4 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency has advanced 4.9 percent this year.  Indonesia’s economy may grow 6.3 percent to 6.8 percent in
2011, after expanding 6.1 percent in 2010, Bank Indonesia
Governor Darmin Nasution said July 12.  Indonesia’s 10-year government bonds fell for a third day.
The yield on the 8.25 percent securities due July 2021 climbed
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.34 percent
today, according to prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
