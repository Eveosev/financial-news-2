Coffee exports from  Uganda  may climb
20 percent this month because of improved yields in the
countryâ€™s southern and southwestern regions, the Uganda Coffee
Development Authority said.  Shipments may increase to 320,000 60-kilogram (132-pound)
bags, from 266,215 bags with farmers expected to release stocks
to gain from rising prices, the agency said on July 16 in an e-
mailed statement from Kampala, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
