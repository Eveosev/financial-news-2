(Corrects to remove erroneous reference to Trust Bank’s
capital level. The story was originally published on July 18.)  Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) , a
Togolese lender that operates in 32 African countries, is
seeking a “significant equity stake” in The Trust Bank Ltd. of
 Ghana , a lender controlled by the country’s state pension fund.  The deal, which is subject to regulatory and corporate
approval, will “support the growth and development aspirations
and the increasing financial needs of the Ghanaian economy,”
said Arnold Ekpe, the lender’s chief executive officer, in a
statement e-mailed by the Ghana Stock Exchange today that didn’t
offer further details.  The Trust Bank, which is  61 percent owned  by the Social
Security and National Insurance Trust, reported profit of 9.6
million cedis in 2008, the latest year for which data were
published on its website. Daniel Kasser-Tee, head of corporate
affairs for The Trust Bank, did not answer a call made to his
mobile phone today.  Shares of Ecobank’s local unit,  Ecobank Ghana Ltd. (EBG) , rose 2
pesewas, or 0.6 percent, to 3.43 cedis by the close in Accra.
Ecobank Transnational’s stock was unchanged at 14 pesewas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
