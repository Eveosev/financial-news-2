Canadian stocks rose, led by energy
producers, after U.S. housing starts surged and companies
including  Mosaic Co. (MOS)  beat analysts’ profit estimates.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the country’s second-
largest energy company by market value, gained 2.5 percent as
crude oil advanced 1.6 percent.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) ,  Canada ’s
biggest base-metals and coal producer, increased 2.4 percent as
copper futures climbed to a three-month high. Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc. rose 2.3 percent after U.S. peer Mosaic
surpassed its average earnings estimate by 9.5 percent,
excluding certain items.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index gained 78.78
points, or 0.6 percent, to 13,332.92.  “We’ve got the first positive economic surprise in a long
time in housing starts this morning,” Keith McLean, who
oversees C$200 million ($211 million) as a managing partner at
GMP Investment Management in Toronto, said in a telephone
interview. “Even the bears coming into this period were
expecting earnings to be solid, but the bears were looking for
negative commentary on guidance, and we’re just not seeing
that.”  The S&P/TSX rallied 52 percent from the first quarter of
2009 to yesterday as at least two-thirds of S&P 500 companies
topped the average profit estimate in each quarter since then,
according to Bloomberg data. Since July 11, 31 of 36 S&P 500
companies and all 5 S&P/TSX companies that have reported
financial results have beaten the average forecast.  Beating Estimates  Companies including Bank of  New York  Mellon Corp.,
International Business Machines Corp., Novartis AG and
UnitedHealth Group Inc. reported earnings that surpassed their
average analyst estimates in Bloomberg surveys since the close
of trading yesterday.  U.S. builders began work on 629,000 new homes in June, the
most since January, compared with a revised 549,000 in May, the
Commerce Department said today in  Washington . Economists had
forecast a rate of 575,000, the median of 71 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey. Building permits increased 2.5 percent, more
than 50 of 51 forecasts.  Fifty-two of 67 S&P/TSX energy companies advanced as crude
futures climbed.  Canadian Natural increased 2.5 percent to C$40.48.  Suncor
Energy Inc. (SU) , Canada’s largest oil and gas producer, rose 2.2
percent to C$38.39.  Nuvista Energy Ltd. (NVA) , a western Canadian oil
and gas producer, jumped 9.2 percent, the most since December
2009, to C$10.13.  Record Gain  PetroBakken Energy Ltd. (PBN) , which explores for light oil in
Canada, rallied a record 15 percent to C$14.31, after closing
yesterday at the lowest price since it began trading in October
2009. Petrobank Energy and Resources Ltd., PetroBakken’s parent
company, surged 15 percent to C$15.16. Shares of both companies
extended their gains after Peter Cheung, Petrobank’s chief
financial officer, said a new well in the Bakken formation of
Saskatchewan will reach full production in 12 months.  The eight S&P/TSX lenders each advanced as the S&P/TSX
Banks Index rebounded from the lowest close since January.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s biggest lender by
