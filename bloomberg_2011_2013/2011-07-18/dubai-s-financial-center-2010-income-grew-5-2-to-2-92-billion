Dubai International Financial
Center, the tax-free  business park  for financial-services
companies, said income rose 5.2 percent in 2010, helped by a
recovery in the Persian Gulf region.  DIFC’s gross domestic product grew to $2.92 billion from
$2.77 billion in 2009, contributing 3.6 percent to Dubai’s
income and about 1 percent to the U.A.E. economy, Nasser Saidi,
DIFC’s chief economist, told a news conference in Dubai today.
The number of financial-services companies increased 8.2 percent
to 383, while the number of those providing business services
rose 4.1 percent to 302.  “The bulk of the companies have come from emerging
markets,  India ,  China ,  South Korea , and our strategy is very
much to focus on emerging markets,” Saidi said. “The safe
haven effect is important for the U.A.E. and Qatar that will
mean that the results of 2011 will be substantially better.”  Dubai set up DIFC in 2004 with its own regulations and an
international stock market to attract foreign banks, asset
managers and insurers to help diversify its economy. Global
banks such as  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , Citigroup Inc. and
 Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  have their regional offices in the DIFC.  DIFC’s GDP dropped 2.4 percent in 2009 to $2.77 billion as
the region suffered from the impact of the global financial
crisis, which hurt investment banking and deal-making. Pro-
democracy movements sweeping the Arab region, which have toppled
governments in Tunisia and Egypt and led to violence in  Libya ,
Yemen, Syria and Bahrain, have benefited Dubai and the United
Arab Emirates as it has been unaffected by unrest.  The DIFC was home to 11,331 full-time employees in 2010 of
which 5,698 worked for finance companies, Saidi said.  An equity market for small- and medium-sized companies that
Dubai is considering setting up has received “official
commitment” from the U.A.E. federal government and from Dubai
and generated substantial interest from finance companies, Saidi
said. An announcement about the initiative may be made in the
next few months, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
