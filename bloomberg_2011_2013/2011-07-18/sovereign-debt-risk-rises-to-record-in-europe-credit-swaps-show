The cost of insuring European
sovereign debt rose to records on concern the region’s crisis is
spreading to its core.  Credit-default swaps on  France  surged 9 basis points to a
record 123 and  Germany  climbed 4 to 64, the highest since March
2009, according to CMA prices at 4:30 p.m. in London. Greece,
Ireland,  Italy ,  Portugal  and Spain also rose to records, helping
push the Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments up 7.5 basis points to an all-time high of 305.5.  Contagion to France and Germany “reflects the reality that
the euro zone is in complete crisis,” said Gary Jenkins, head
of fixed income at Evolution Securities Ltd. in London. “If we
get anywhere close to looking at France, it’s game over.”  European leaders are holding a special summit this week as
they seek to contain the debt crisis, after stress tests
published July 15 failed to reassure investors the region’s
banks could withstand a sovereign default. European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet reiterated the ECB won’t accept
bonds from a defaulting nation as collateral, putting it at odds
with politicians pushing for private investors to share the
burden of rescuing  Greece .  Contracts on Greece jumped 92 basis points to 2,507,
signaling an 88 percent probability of default within five
years. Ireland climbed 47 basis points to 1,181, Italy increased
20 to 326 and Portugal rose 54 to 1,200, while Spain jumped 26
to 375 and Belgium was 8 higher at 213.  Stress Test  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers increased 3.5 basis points to 192.5 and
the subordinated index climbed 7 to 336.5, both the highest
since Jan. 11, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. As many as 20
banks may need to bolster capital after eight lenders failed the
stress tests, JPMorgan analysts said after the results were
published.  Swaps on peripheral banks led the rise in financial debt
risk, with  Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP)  soaring 73 basis points to a
record 652, according to CMA.  The region’s phone companies also rose to all-time highs,
with  Hellenic Telecommunications Organization SA (HTO)  in  Athens 
surging 430 basis points to 1,142 and Madrid-based  Telefonica SA (TEF) 
jumping 22 to 273.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 9
basis points to 469, the highest since Dec. 2, JPMorgan prices
show.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 2.75 basis points to 125.5 basis
points, the highest in more than a year.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14 million) of debt from default for five years
is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face
value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
