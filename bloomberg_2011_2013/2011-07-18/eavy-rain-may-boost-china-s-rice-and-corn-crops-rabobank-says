Heavy rains in southern and central
 China  starting in June may have helped the growth of rice and
corn crops even as they caused deadly flooding in some regions,
Rabobank International said.  The rainfall was “welcomed by farmers” as some arid land
in the Yangtze River basin would have benefited from the much-
needed water, analyst Jean-Yves Chow wrote in a report on July
15. The rains may have also helped to improve soil moisture for
recently planted corn in central China, Chow said.  Drought in winter and spring affected China’s northern
wheat regions and central Yangtze River rice-growing provinces,
while deadly floods ensued in the summer, raising concerns that
food prices may gain, Chow wrote. The extreme weather likely
didn’t hurt production significantly, he said.  While drought may have hurt some early-season rice in the
Yangtze River region, the crop makes up only 17 percent of total
rice output, and overall production should benefit from the
subsequent rain, Chow said.  China’s wheat output this year may be 115 million metric
tons, matching last year’s harvest, or enough to meet demand,
Chow said. The country’s large stockpiles of wheat will also
help to ensure stable supply, Chow said.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
