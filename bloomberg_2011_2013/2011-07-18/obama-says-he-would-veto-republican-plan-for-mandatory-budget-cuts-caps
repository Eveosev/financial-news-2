President Barack Obama would veto a
House Republican proposal to impose mandatory budget cuts and
set caps for  government spending  in order to raise the federal
debt limit, the administration said in a statement.  “Neither setting arbitrary spending levels nor amending
the Constitution is necessary to restore fiscal
responsibility,” the statement said. The Republican proposal.
known as the “Cut, Cap and Balance Act,” would “undercut”
the government’s ability to meet its commitments, the statement
said.  The House plans to vote this week on an increase in the
debt ceiling tied to a balanced-budget amendment that will let
Republicans go on record while offering no immediate resolution
by the Aug. 2 deadline Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner  has
set for raising the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
