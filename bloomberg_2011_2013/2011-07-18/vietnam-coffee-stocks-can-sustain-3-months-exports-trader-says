Coffee inventories in  Vietnam , the
top global producer of the robusta variety, can sustain only
three months of exports, Nedcoffee BV said.  Stockpiles came to 187,343 metric tons at the end of May,
with 130,306 tons stored in bonded warehouses, the Dutch trader
estimated in a monthly report e-mailed today. The Southeast
Asian country exported 80,118 tons last month, said  Nedcoffee ,
which has local offices.  “Currently, according to some traders in  Dak Lak , the
inventory of the farmers and the exporters is just under 200,000
metric tons, only enough for 3 months export,” the trader said.
Dak Lak is Vietnam’s main producing region.  “Two large companies” own more than 50 percent of the
coffee stored in bonded warehouses and private warehouses of
foreign firms, Nedcoffee said, without being more specific.  Companies with ample reserves are selling beans at elevated
prices to exporters that need to meet previously signed
contracts, according to the report.  Vietnamese coffee commands a premium of $160 a ton over
prices on NYSE Liffe, Nedcoffee said. Robusta for September
delivery slipped $3, or 0.1 percent, to $2,273 a ton on the
exchange by 10:57 a.m. in  London . Prices are up 8.4 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
