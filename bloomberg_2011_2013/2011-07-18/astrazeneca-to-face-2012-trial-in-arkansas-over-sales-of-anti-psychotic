AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  must face a trial
over claims by Arkansas that the drugmaker hid health risks of
its anti-psychotic drug Seroquel when selling it to residents
covered by the state’s Medicaid program, a judge ruled.  London-based AstraZeneca, which agreed in March to pay
$68.5 million to resolve claims that it deceptively marketed
Seroquel in a number of states, will face a September 2012 trial
of a lawsuit filed by Arkansas Attorney General  Dustin McDaniel 
over sales of the drug, Circuit Judge  Chris Piazza  in Little
Rock ruled today.  Arkansas officials, who opted out of the March Seroquel
settlement, contend AstraZeneca defrauded the state’s Medicaid
program by failing to properly outline the anti-psychotic
medicine’s risks in its warning label. The state seeks a $5,000
penalty for each Seroquel prescription written in Arkansas over
an 11-year period starting in 1997, according to  Fletcher
Trammell , one of the state’s lawyers.  AstraZeneca officials are confident the drugmaker will be
“fully vindicated as the case progresses” in Arkansas,  Tony Jewell , a U.S.-based spokesman for the company, said in an e-
mailed statement. AstraZeneca is the U.K.’s second-largest
drugmaker after GlaxoSmithKline Plc.  Over the last year, AstraZeneca officials have been working
to resolve litigation over Seroquel, which was the company’s
second-biggest selling drug in 2009 after the ulcer medicine
Nexium.  Settling Claims  The company agreed to pay almost $1 billion to resolve
claims by the U.S. government and 37 states over Seroquel
marketing. That figure also includes more than $345 million in
settlements of patient lawsuits over the drug. AstraZeneca
officials said in August that they had resolved about two-thirds
of the 26,000 product-liability suits filed over the medicine.  In the accords with state and federal officials,
AstraZeneca resolved claims that the company marketed Seroquel
for uses that weren’t approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. AstraZeneca promoted the drug, approved for
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, for dementia, depression and
anxiety in violation of federal drug rules, according to the
states.  While doctors can prescribe medicines for other diseases,
companies aren’t allowed to market drugs beyond approved uses.  In the  Arkansas  case, the state’s lawyers contend
AstraZeneca officials knew prior to putting Seroquel on the U.S.
market in 1997 that it could cause some users to gain weight and
develop diabetes, according to court filings.  ‘Material Misrepresentation’  The drugmaker failed to include those risks on the
product’s label and that amounted to a “material
misrepresentation” under the state’s Medicaid Fraud False
Claims Act, Trammell told Piazza at a hearing today.  Steven Quattlebaum , a Little Rock-based lawyer for
AstraZeneca, countered that state officials couldn’t properly
press fraud claims under the Medicaid law over Seroquel’s label.  The claims are “simply insufficient to proceed” under
Arkansas law, he said.  Piazza agreed to throw out the state’s claims seeking
damages over Seroquel sales under Arkansas consumer-protection
laws. Still, the judge rejected AstraZeneca’s bid to have the
Medicaid fraud claims dismissed.  The case is State of Arkansas v. AstraZeneca
Pharmaceuticals LP, 08-5448, Pulaski County, Arkansas, Circuit
Court ( Little Rock ).  To contact the reporters on this story:
