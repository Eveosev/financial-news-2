Nigerian inflation slowed to 10.2
percent in June as the naira gained to a four-month high against
the dollar, curbing the cost of imported food in  Africa ’s most-
populous nation.  The inflation rate fell from 12.4 percent in May, the
 National Bureau of Statistics  said in a statement released in
the capital, Abuja, today. Prices rose 1 percent in the month.  The naira climbed 2.8 percent against the dollar in June,
with the  interbank rate  reaching as high as 152.275 on June 30
after the central bank lifted a curb on foreign investors’ bond
holdings. That may ease pressure on the bank to raise its
benchmark interest rate after increasing it three times this
year to 8 percent.  “The relative appreciation in the dollar-naira rate in
recent weeks should help contain exogenous price pressures and
even support the downward trend in consumer prices in the second
half,”  Samir Gadio , an emerging markets strategist at Standard
Bank Group Ltd. in  London , said before today’s data.  The Central Bank of  Nigeria , led by Governor Lamido Sanusi,
is aiming to bring inflation down to below 10 percent. In order
to curb price pressures, the bank sells foreign currency at bi-
weekly auctions to help restrict the naira to within a range of
3 percent above or below 150 per dollar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
