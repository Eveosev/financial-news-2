(Corrects amount of planned investment in first paragraph.)  Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269) , the Japanese
automaker 20 percent owned by  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , said it is
reconsidering a plan to invest 1.5 billion yen in its Sagara
factory, which is about 11 kilometers (7 miles) the Hamaoka
nuclear power plant that was shut in May amid safety concerns.  Toshihiro Suzuki, executive vice president at the automaker,
spoke to reporters today in Hamamatsu, Japan, and cited the
plantâ€™s proximity to the nuclear plant.  The automaker said last month it was considering shifting
output away from the Sagara plant because of safety risks
related to the Hamaoka nuclear facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
