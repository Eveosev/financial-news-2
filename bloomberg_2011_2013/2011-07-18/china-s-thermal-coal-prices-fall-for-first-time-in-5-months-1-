China ’s benchmark thermal-coal price
fell for the first time in almost five months after power
stations built up inventories of the fuel for the summer.  Coal with an energy value of 5,500 kilocalories per
kilogram at Qinhuangdao port declined 0.9 percent to 840 yuan
($130) to 850 yuan a metric ton as of today compared with a week
earlier, according to data published on the  website  of Beijing-
based China Coal Transport and Distribution Association. That’s
the first decline since Feb. 28.  China’s  power plants  typically complete fuel stockpiling
before peak summer demand in July through September. Inventories
at major power plants increased 7.6 million tons from a year
earlier to 65.4 million tons at the end of June, equivalent to
18 days of consumption, the National Development and Reform
Commission said in a statement on its website today.  Industrial production in June exceeded forecasts by
economists, helping support coal prices because of electricity
demand from factories.  Coal stockpiles at Qinhuangdao, which ships half the
nation’s seaborne coal, fell 2.6 percent to 7.08 million tons,
the second straight week of decline, according to today’s data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
