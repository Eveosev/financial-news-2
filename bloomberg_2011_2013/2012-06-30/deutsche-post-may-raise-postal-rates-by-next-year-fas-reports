Deutsche Post AG (DPW)  may raise postal
rates by next year after years of constant prices, Frankfurter
Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported, citing an interview with
Deutsche Post Chief Financial Officer Larry Rosen.  Deutsche Post will check in autumn whether it is possible
to raise rates, Rosen said to the paper. The company sees
effects from the euro-area debt crisis in its airfreight
business as some customers prefer the cheaper way of shipping
their goods, Rosen said in the interview with the Frankfurt-
based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
