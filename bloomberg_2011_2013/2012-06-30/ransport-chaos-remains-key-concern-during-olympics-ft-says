Transport disruption remains the
biggest issue for  London ’s commuters and businesses during the
Olympic Games to be held next month, the Financial Times
reported.  People living in London are being treated as “third class
citizens in their own city,” the FT said, citing an entry on
the London Cyclist blog.  Locog, the games organizing committee, is attempting to
reduce the impact caused by the Olympic routes network including
specific roads which have been set aside for use by athletes and
games officials, the report said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
