Yohan Blake upset world record
holder Usain Bolt in the 100-meter final last night at the
trials for the Jamaican Olympic team.  Blake, the reigning world champion, clocked a personal-best
time of 9.75 seconds in Kingston to beat the defending Olympic
champion by 0.11 seconds. Only Bolt, Asafa Powell and Tyson Gay
have ever run faster.  Powell finished third in 9.88 seconds to join Blake and
Bolt on  Jamaica ’s sprint team for the London Games next month.  “I am happy with becoming the national champion,” Blake
said on the  website  of the International Association of
Athletics Federations, the sport’s governing body. “I won the
world championships last year, now the national championship, so
I now go to the Olympic Games.”  Blake captured the world title last year in Daegu,  South
Korea , after defending champion Bolt was disqualified for a
false start. Last night was Bolt’s first loss in a 100-meter
race, excluding the disqualification, in almost two years,
according to the IAAF.  “I had trouble getting out, but I kept feeling like I
could not give up,” said Bolt, who set the world mark of 9.58
seconds at the 2009 world championships in Berlin.  The London  Olympic Games  will be held from July 27 to Aug.
