Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. has
exited the assets of its unit Aurora Bank FSB in a transaction
that could help reap about $1.5 billion for creditors, the
Financial Times reported.  Auroraâ€™s $64 billion residential mortgage servicing rights
have been sold to Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc., which is
owned by  Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) , the report said, citing
Lehman. The collapse of Lehman in 2008 left behind two mortgage
subsidiaries including Aurora Bank and  Woodlands Commercial
Bank , the report said.  The combined sale of both bank assets will earn about $1.5
billion for creditors, the FT said, citing Douglas Lambert,
managing director of Alvarez & Marsal.  To contact the reporters on this story:
