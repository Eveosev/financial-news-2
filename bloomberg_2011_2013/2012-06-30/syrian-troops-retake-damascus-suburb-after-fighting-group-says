Syrian forces have retaken the
Damascus suburb of Douma after days of heaving fighting with
rebels, the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for  Human Rights  said.  The situation in Douma “is very bad,” Rami Abdel Rahman,
the head of the group, said in a phone interview. “We have
received reports of dead bodies on the street.”  Foreign ministers of the five permanent United Nations
Security Council members -- China, France, Russia, the U.K. and
the U.S. -- as well as Turkey, Qatar, Kuwait and  Iraq  are at a
conference in Geneva today to discuss United Nations special
envoy  Kofi Annan ’s peace plan. The plan seeks to end 16 months
of violence that has claimed more than 10,000 lives.  About 4,000 Syrians have been killed since Annan took on
the peacemaking mission in February, according to the Local
Coordination Committees, an activist group. Sixteen people were
killed by Syrian forces today, the Observatory said in an e-
mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
