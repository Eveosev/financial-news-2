Scott Weltz touched the wall ahead
of favorites Brendan Hansen and Eric Shanteau in the men’s 200-
meter breaststroke at the U.S. Olympic trials.  Weltz covered the four lengths in 2 minutes, 9.01 seconds.
Clark Burckle finished in 2:09.97 for the second U.S. Olympic
spot in the event. American record-holder Shanteau was third and
Hansen was fourth at the trials in Omaha,  Nebraska , and failed
to qualify for the London Games in that event.  “I owe it all to my coach,” Weltz said during a televised
interview. “He never stopped believing. He told me every day I
could do it.”  Hansen and Shanteau claimed the top two spots in the 100-
meter breaststroke earlier in the trials.  “I think you guys are as surprised as I am,” Hansen said.
“I can’t believe Eric and I are not swimming the 200. I didn’t
think Weltz had it in him. He swam like a big-time swimmer.”  Nathan Adrian won the men’s 100-meter freestyle in 48.10
seconds, followed by Cullen Jones at 48.46 seconds.  “I thought I wouldn’t have nerves going into it, but I was
as nervous as ever,” Adrian said.  Cammile Adams touched the wall first in the women’s 200-
meter butterfly, covering the distance in 2:06.52. Kathleen
Hersey was second in 2:07.72.  Michael Phelps  and  Ryan Lochte  face each other today in the
200-meter individual medley final, their third and final
showdown before the Olympics.  Lochte will swim in the 200-meter backstroke about 20
minutes before he faces Phelps in the individual medley final.  “I’m up for that challenge,” Lochte said. “It’s
something I’ve been doing for four years now: challenging
myself. I’m definitely ready.”  Lochte, 27, beat Phelps, 26, in their first meeting of the
trials -- the 400-meter individual medley, in which Phelps is
the Olympic champion and Lochte is the world champion. Phelps
then topped Lochte in the 200-meter freestyle final.  Tonight’s other finals are the women’s 100-meter freestyle
and the women’s 200-meter breaststroke.  To contact the reporter on this story:
