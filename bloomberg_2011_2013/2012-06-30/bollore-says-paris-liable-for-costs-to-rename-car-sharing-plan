Bollore SA (BOL) , an investment company
controlled by French billionaire  Vincent Bollore , said the city
of Paris is contractually responsible for any costs to change
the name of the Autolib’ car-sharing program it runs.  The company may not be able to use the Autolib’ brand after
a decision by the Paris Court of Appeal, Puteaux-based Bollore
wrote in an e-mailed statement today. The city of Paris picked
the name and granted it to Bollore, and therefore must bear the
financial consequences of renaming, the company said.  The investment firm is licensed to run the electric car-
sharing program in the city until 2023. The court found the
Autolib’ name is too similar to the Autoliberte brand used by
car-rental company Europcar, and gave the French capital a month
to stop using it,  Les Echos  reported yesterday.  “The name change would obviously be a lot of work to carry
out,” Bollore said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
