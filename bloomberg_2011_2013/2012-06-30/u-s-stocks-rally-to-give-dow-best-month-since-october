U.S. stocks rallied for the week,
lifting the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  to the best monthly
gain since October, amid optimism an agreement by European
leaders on banks will help contain the region’s debt crisis.  All  10 industry groups  in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
rose. Energy companies jumped the most, climbing 4.8 percent, as
oil rebounded. A gauge of homebuilders rallied 13 percent as
housing data beat forecasts and Lennar Corp.’s profit surged.
Hospital companies including  Tenet (THC)  Healthcare Corp. jumped after
the Supreme Court upheld the core of President  Barack Obama ’s
industry overhaul.  Nike Inc. (NKE)  sank 12 percent while  Research In
Motion Ltd. (RIM)  plunged 25 percent amid disappointing earnings.  The S&P 500 advanced 2 percent to 1,362.16 during the week,
extending its increase in June to 4 percent, the most since
February. The Dow gained 239.31 points, or 1.9 percent, to
12,880.09 for the week, finishing the month up 3.9 percent.  “It looks like Europe is moving toward a resolution of
keeping the euro together,” George Young, a partner at St.
Denis J. Villere & Co. in New Orleans, said in a telephone
interview. His firm oversees about $1.6 billion. “We are
putting money into stocks. We believe that the U.S. is going to
do well longer term.”  Global stocks rallied on the last day of the week, with the
 S&P 500  surging 2.5 percent for its biggest advance of the year,
as euro-area leaders agreed to relax conditions on emergency
loans for Spanish banks and possible help for Italy. In the
U.S., economic reports during the week showed home sales and
orders for durable goods rebounded while consumer spending
stalled and confidence among Americans declined to the lowest
level this year.  Worst Quarter  Concern that Spanish banks may fail and Greece would leave
the 17-nation euro zone drove the S&P 500 down as much as 9.9
percent from this year’s high in April. Even after this month’s
rebound, the benchmark gauge lost 3.3 percent since the end of
March, the  worst quarter  since the three months ended September.
The Dow slumped 2.5 percent for the quarter.  The S&P 500 Energy Index jumped 4.8 percent, the biggest
weekly increase since December, as oil soared the most in more
than three years on June 29. The gain in crude may accelerate
after the European Union’s ban on the purchase, transport,
financing and insurance of Iranian crude starts on July 1, a
Bloomberg survey showed. Chevron Corp., the second-largest U.S.
energy producer, advanced 5 percent to $105.50. Bigger rival
Exxon Mobil Corp. rose 4.2 percent to $85.57.  Homebuilders Rally  An S&P gauge of homebuilders rallied 13 percent to the
highest level since 2008 as reports showed sales of new homes
increased to a two-year high and housing prices dropped at the
slowest pace in more than a year.  Lennar (LEN)  climbed 17 percent to
$30.91 after a tax benefit and improving demand fueled a surge
in its fiscal second-quarter profit.  KB Home (KBH)  soared 20 percent
to $9.80 after reporting a narrower quarterly loss.  Tenet, the third-biggest U.S. hospital chain, climbed 7.2
percent to $5.24. The Supreme Court, voting 5-4, largely left
intact the Affordable Care Act’s transformation of the health
system, saying Congress has the power to make Americans get
insurance or pay a penalty. They also let stand a plan to expand
Medicaid by about 16 million people, though the justices limited
the power to punish states that don’t comply. The new
regulations may arrest a rising tide of uninsured patients
unable to pay their medical bills.  Commercial carriers fell in the face of the law’s new
regulations.  WellPoint Inc. (WLP) , the second-largest U.S. health
insurer, dropped 8.6 percent to $63.79.  Financial Shares  Optimism over Europe’s efforts to tame the debt crisis
helped buoy financial shares, pushing the  S&P 500 index (SPX)  of
banks, brokerages and insurers up 2.2 percent.  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  increased 3 percent to $8.18 while Morgan Stanley rose 3.2
percent to $14.59.  Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW) , the life insurer and mortgage
guarantor, surged 9.5 percent to $5.66 as hedge fund Highfields
Capital Management LP said it is in talks with management about
increasing the value of its stake.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  fell 0.7 percent to $35.73. The
lender’s losses from credit derivatives may eventually total as
much as $9 billion, exceeding the firm’s initial estimate, the
 New York  Times reported.  Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ)  had the biggest gain in the S&P
500, soaring 40 percent to $27.06. The company agreed to buy the
other half of its Crown Imports joint venture with Grupo Modelo
SAB for about $1.85 billion, becoming the sole U.S. importer of
top-selling Corona beer.  News Corp. (NWSA)   News Corp. climbed 9.5 percent to $22.29. The company
announced plans to split into two publicly traded entities
focused on publishing and entertainment after shareholder
pressure prompted the biggest reorganization since  Rupert Murdoch  built the media empire.  Europe’s debt crisis and a slowdown in global growth may
have taken a toll on corporate earnings. Profits at S&P 500
companies are forecast to show a drop of 1.8 percent in the
second quarter, according to analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Earnings pessimism reached levels last seen during the
financial crisis. Ninety-four corporations issued profit
projections that trailed analyst estimates during the 30 days
through June 29, or 3.4 times the number of those that exceeded
them. The  ratio  was the highest since March 2009, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Research In Motion plunged 25 percent, the most since 2008,
to $7.39 after posting a loss and delaying the next BlackBerry
operating system. The smartphone maker also said it would cut
5,000 jobs.  Nike, Facebook  Nike, the world’s largest sporting-goods company, tumbled
12 percent to $87.78 after fourth-quarter  profit unexpectedly
declined  for the first time since 2009, hurt by an increase in
marketing and labor costs.  O’Reilly Automotive Inc. (ORLY)  fell the most in the S&P 500,
sinking 14 percent to $83.77. The retailer of auto parts, tools
and accessories said sales growth was slower than expected and
second-quarter profit will be on the lower end of the company’s
forecast range.  Facebook Inc. (FB)  slid 5.9 percent to $31.10 as analysts said
the stock is worth no more than its debut price of $38. Analysts
including those at lead underwriter  Morgan Stanley (MS)  have an
average 12-month price estimate of $37.52 on the social-network
operator, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Facebook has
lost 18 percent since its May initial public offering on concern
the stock is overvalued and the company will struggle to attract
users.  To contact the reporter on this story:
