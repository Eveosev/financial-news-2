Germany  will stick to its airline
ticket tax amid criticism from airlines and from Transport
Minister Peter Ramsauer, Handelsblatt reported, citing an
unnamed government official.  There is no massive damage to the industry with passenger
volumes up by 4.6 percent to almost 200 million last year, the
paper said, citing an report from the  Finance Ministry  to the
Bundestag, the German parliament, or lower house.  To contact the reporter on this story:
