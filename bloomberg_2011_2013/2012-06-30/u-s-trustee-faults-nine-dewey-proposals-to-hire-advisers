Law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP was
assailed by the U.S. trustee who supervises bankruptcies over
nine proposals to hire advisers, including the law firm of Togut
Segal & Segal LLP, and a six-week budget of $7 million for
paying the firms.  Proskauer Rose LLP may have conflicts as it hired former
Dewey lawyers, public relations firm Sitrick & Co. may not be
needed for bankrupt Dewey’s liquidation, and several firms’
duties would overlap, Tracy Hope Davis said in a filing in  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court  in  Manhattan  yesterday.  Dewey’s hiring applications don’t accord with bankruptcy
rules and don’t disclose enough essential information, the
trustee said. A violation of limits for professional fees could
also cut off Dewey’s access to use of funds made available by
lenders for the liquidation, Davis said.  Albert Togut, Dewey’s lead bankruptcy adviser, and  Michael Sitrick , a spokesman, didn’t immediately respond to e-mails
seeking comment on the trustee’s objections sent after normal
business hours.  The case is In re Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP, 12-12321, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
