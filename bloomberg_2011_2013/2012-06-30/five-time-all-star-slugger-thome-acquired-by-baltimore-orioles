Five-time All-Star designated hitter
Jim Thome was acquired by the Baltimore Orioles, who sent minor
league pitcher Kyle Simon and catcher Gabriel Lino to the
Philadelphia Phillies, the team said.  Thome, 41, has 609 Major League Baseball home runs, which
ties him with  Sammy Sosa  for seventh place on the all-time home
runs list. Among active players, heâ€™s behind only  Alex Rodriguez ,
who has 642 homers.  Thome recorded 12 or more seasons with at least 30 home
runs, joining Rodriguez,  Hank Aaron ,  Barry Bonds , Mike Schmidt,
Manny Ramirez and Jimmie Foxx.  In 30 games for the Phillies this year, Thome batted .242
with five home runs and 15 runs batted in.  Simon, 21, was selected in the fourth round of the 2011
First-Year Player Draft and was 2-8 with a 3.96 earned run
average in 14 starts for Class-A Frederick in 2012.  Lino, 19, who was signed by the Orioles as a non-drafted
free agent on Dec. 14, 2009, was batting .218 with four home
runs and 18 RBI in 56 games for Class-A Delmarva.  To contact the reporter on this story:
