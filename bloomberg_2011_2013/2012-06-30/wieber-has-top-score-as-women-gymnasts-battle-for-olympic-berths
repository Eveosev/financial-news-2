Reigning world champion Jordyn
Wieber took the all-around lead after the first day in the
women’s U.S. gymnastics Olympic trials with a score of 61.700.  Gabby Douglas was second with a score of 61.400, with
Alexandra Raisman third at 60.300. The second day of the women’s
competition is tomorrow, after which the five-woman U.S. team
will be selected for the London Olympics.  Bridget Sloan, the 2009 world champion and a member of the
U.S. team that won the silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Games,
dropped out of running for the Olympic team after spraining her
left elbow during warmups on the uneven bars last night at the
trials at the HP Pavilion in  San Jose ,  California .  Today is the final day of competition for the men, with 15
competitors vying for the five spots on that team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
