New York Yankees shortstop  Derek Jeter  passed Hall of Famer Cal Ripken Jr. to take sole
possession of the 13th spot on Major League Baseball’s career
hits list.  Jeter recorded his 3,185th hit when he doubled into the
left-field corner to lead off the first inning in New York’s
14-7 loss against the  Chicago White Sox  last night at Yankee
Stadium. Holding the 12th position is Nap Lajoie with 3,252
hits, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.  “Derek has been such a special player for such a long time
and I am happy to see him continue to play at a high level,”
Ripken, a former Baltimore Orioles infielder, said in a
statement. “He represents the game and the Yankees wonderfully
and I hope that he continues to play and continues to give all
of us baseball fans great memories.”  Ripken holds the record for playing in 2,632 consecutive
games. He surpassed Yankees Hall of Famer, Lou Gehrig , whose
record 2,130 straight games had stood for 56 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
