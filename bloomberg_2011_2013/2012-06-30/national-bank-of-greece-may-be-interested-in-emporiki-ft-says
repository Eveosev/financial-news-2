National Bank of Greece SA ,  Alpha
Bank AE (ALPHA)  and  EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB)  have shown interest in
buying  Credit Agricole SA’s (ACA)  Greek unit, the Financial Times
reported.  France ’s Credit Agricole asked local Greek banks to submit
bids for a majority stake in its Emporiki Bank SA unit earlier
in June amid concerns of a bank run in  Greece , the FT said,
citing an unidentified source.  The three banks indicated they were prepared to make bids
for Emporiki if they get approval from the Hellenic Financial
Stability fund, according to the report. The French bank
declined to comment, the report said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
