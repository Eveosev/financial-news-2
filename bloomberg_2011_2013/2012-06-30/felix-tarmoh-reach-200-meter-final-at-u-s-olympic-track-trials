Allyson Felix and Jeneba Tarmoh, who
tied for the third U.S. Olympic spot in the women’s 100 meters,
advanced to the final of the 200 with identical semifinal times
at the national track and field trials.  Felix, a silver medalist in the 200 at the 2008 Beijing
Olympics, won her semifinal last night in 22.30 seconds and
Tarmoh was first in hers in the same time. The night’s best time
of 22.15 was turned in by Sanya Richards-Ross, who placed first
in the 400 on June 24.  The 200 final is set for tonight at the trials in Eugene,
 Oregon , with the top three finishers qualifying for the U.S.
team for the London Olympics.  Felix and Tarmoh finished the 100 final on June 23 with
identical times of 11.068, and it has not yet been determined
whether a coin toss or a run-off will be used to pick the third
qualifier in that event.  There were finals in two events last night at the trials.  Jillian Camarena-Williams won the women’s shot put with a
toss of 62 feet, 10 1/2 inches (19.16 meters). Joining her on
the Olympic squad were Michelle Carter, second with 60-11 1/4,
and Tia Brooks (60-2).  In the women’s 3,000-meter steeplechase, the winner was
Emma Coburn with a time of 9 minutes, 32.78 seconds. Bridget
Franek was second in 9:35.62, and Shalaya Kipp was third in
9:35.73.  To contact the reporter on this story:
