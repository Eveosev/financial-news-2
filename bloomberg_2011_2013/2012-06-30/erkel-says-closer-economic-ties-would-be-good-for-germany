Germany and the U.S. would benefit
from closer economic ties that are currently hampered by trade
barriers,  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said.  Merkel, who welcomed free trade talks between the European
Union and the U.S., said closer ties would promote economic
growth and  job creation  in both nations, in her weekly podcast
today.  “We could develop our economies even more, and generate
more growth, more jobs, if we didn’t have so many trade
obstacles,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
