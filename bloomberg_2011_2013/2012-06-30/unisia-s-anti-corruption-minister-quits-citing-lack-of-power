Tunisia’s administrative reform
minister resigned today, citing what he said was the
government’s impeding of his ability to combat corruption in the
country.  Mohamed Abbou told reporters in Tunis that while he was
committed to fighting corruption, he had not been given enough
authority to fulfill his mandate in the interim government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
