Germany  won’t create new subsidies
for renewables or customers to finance a faster exit from
nuclear energy announced last year, Focus reported, citing an
interview with Environment Minister Peter Altmaier.  “I will not create new subsidies as we need to get our
 energy policy  working on the principles of a market economy,”
Altmaier told Focus. It is clear the decision to exit nuclear
energy will increase electricity prices in Germany, Focus cited
Altmaier as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
