Turkey ’s parliament will vote on a
draft law that seeks to limit the powers of the country’s
special courts, the institutions that have been investigating
alleged plots to overthrow the government, Anatolian agency
reported, citing Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag.  Existing cases at the courts, which include the prosecution
of several alleged coup plots and a match-fixing probe in
Turkish soccer, won’t be affected by the amendments in the law,
he is cited as saying.  The special courts and prosecutors attached to them have
jailed dozens of senior military officers as well as
journalists, politicians and academics, as part of probes into
alleged conspiracies against Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s government and a previous Islamist-led administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
