     June 30 (Bloomberg)-- Gunmen suspected of belonging to the
Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram killed three police officers
yesterday during an attack in the northeastern Adamawa state,
police said.  The assailants burned down a police headquarters located in
Gulak, in Madagali local government area of the state, spokesman
Nemuel Yoila said by phone today from Yola, the capital of
Adamawa.  The gunmen also raided a bank in the town, seizing an
undisclosed sum of money, Yoila said.  Authorities in  Nigeria ,  Africa ’s top oil producer, blame
Boko Haram, which wants to impose strict Islamic law in the
country, for attacks in the mainly Muslim north and in the
capital Abuja that have killed hundreds of people this year.  Boko Haram began its violent campaign in 2009 in Africa’s
most populous nation, which is roughly split between a mainly
Muslim north and predominantly Christian south.  To contact the reporter on this story:
