U.K. 10-year gilts fell for a fourth
week, the longest losing streak since July 2009, as optimism
European Union measures will help to ease the region’s debt
crisis damped demand for the safety of British  government bonds .  Yields on the benchmark debt touched the most in five weeks
after euro-area leaders meeting in Brussels over the previous
two days agreed to ease repayment rules for emergency loans to
Spanish banks. The pound climbed against the dollar even as data
confirmed the U.K. economy is in its first double-dip recession
since the 1970s, adding to pressure on the  Bank of England  to
boost stimulus.  “Gilts have definitely been driven by the summit,” said
 Elisabeth Afseth , a fixed-income analyst at Investec Bank Plc in
London. “Some of the safe-haven bid could fall away.”  The yield on the 10-year gilt rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, in the week to 1.73 percent at 5 p.m. London
time yesterday. The 4 percent bond due March 2022 lost 0.135, or
1.35 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 120.115.  The pound posted a 0.6 percent gain to trade at $1.5680.
While it weakened 0.1 percent to 80.69 pence per euro in the
five days to yesterday, sterling advanced for a fourth quarter.  Bank of England policy makers meet at a two-day policy
meeting starting July 4. The central bank will expand its asset-
purchase program by 50 billion pounds to 375 billion pounds at
the gathering, according to the median estimate of economists in
a  Bloomberg News survey .  Economic Outlook  Governor  Mervyn King  said June 26 that his vote for more
stimulus at the most recent meeting reflected his worries about
a deteriorating global economic outlook at a time when he’s
pessimistic that  Europe ’s debt crisis can be resolved.  Reports confirmed gross domestic product shrank 0.3 percent
in the first quarter, and that disposable incomes fell.  Consumer
confidence  failed to improve in June, according to a GfK NOP
Ltd. survey published yesterday.  U.K. government debt has handed investors a return of 2.9
percent this year to June 28, outperforming the 2.4 percent gain
in German bunds, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  The Debt Management Office plans to auction 6.25 billion
pounds of bonds due September 2017 and December 2030 next week.
It will also offer 3.5 billion pounds of bills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
