Renault SA (RNO)  is seeking to build
between 5,000 and 10,000 Alpine sports cars a year should the model 
go into production, LaTribune.fr  reported , citing an interview with
Jean-Pascal Dauce, motor-sport director at Renault Sport.  The automaker is aiming for a retail price of between
35,000 euros ($44,330) and 40,000 euros for the car, which would
be built at an existing plant in Dieppe, northwest of Paris,
Dauce said, according to LaTribune.  If Renault decides by the end of the year to give the go-
ahead, the car could be available for sale in three years,
LaTribune reported, without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
