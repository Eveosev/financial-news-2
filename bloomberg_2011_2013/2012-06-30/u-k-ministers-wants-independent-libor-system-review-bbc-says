the end of the summer, the  BBC  reported, citing an unidentified
person at the governing  Conservative Party . Ministers are also
considering a review into bankersâ€™ professional standards, it
said.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  has confirmed
that  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Royal Bank of  Scotland , UBS AG and
