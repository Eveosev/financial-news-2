Andre Villas-Boas, the former
Chelsea manager who was fired on March 4, will give up 10.8
million pounds ($17 million) of compensation when he takes up
his new job at Tottenham Hotspur next week, the Sun reported.  Chelsea has been paying Villas-Boas 100,000 pounds a week
until he got a new job as compensation instead of a lump sum
when he was fired, the Sun said. Villas-Boas will be forced to
give up payments for a further 25 months after he takes up the
managerâ€™s position at Tottenham, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
