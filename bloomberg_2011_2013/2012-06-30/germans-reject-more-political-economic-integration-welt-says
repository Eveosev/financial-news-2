More than half of Germans polled by
Infratest dimap on behalf of Welt am Sonntag rejected a stronger
economic and political integration of European states as it
would cede power to Brussels, Welt am Sonntag reported.  Fifty-one percent rejected the idea that the European Union
should move toward a  United States  of  Europe , with 43 percent
supporting such a development. Infratest dimap  conducted the
survey of eligible voters on June 26 and 27, Die Welt am Sonntag
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
