Goaltender Martin Biron agreed to
terms on a new contract with the  New York Rangers , General
Manager Glen Sather said.  The National Hockey League team didnâ€™t disclose terms of
the deal. The two-year contract is worth $2.6 million, ESPN
reported, citing a person familiar with the negotiations.  Biron, 34, has posted a 20-12-2 record in 38 games during
the last two seasons with the Rangers after signing with the
team as a free agent on July 1, 2010.  Last season, Biron was 12-6-2 in 21 games and tied for
fourth among NHL goaltenders with three assists on the season.  The 14-year NHL veteran has appeared in 500 career regular-
season games with the Buffalo Sabres,  Philadelphia Flyers , New
York Islanders and Rangers, posting a record of 228-188-25-26.  He is one of only four players in NHL history, along with
