Romania ’s Democrat-Liberal Party,
the country’s biggest opposition member, elected Vasile Blaga as
its new leader replacing former Prime Minister Emil Boc to shore
up voter confidence ahead of elections.  Blaga, 56, who also heads the Parliament’s upper house and
was the only candidate for the position, received 1,197 votes
cast by the Democrat-Liberals, while 28 voted against him.  “We plan to revive” the party “as the main catalyst for
all right-wing political parties,” Blaga said before the vote.
“We are headed toward a tough battle at general elections.”  The Democrat-Liberals, part of a coalition that supported
previous governments led by Boc and Mihai-Razvan Ungureanu, saw
their public support cut by more than half to about 16 percent
in local elections on June 10. A wave of party defections
allowed the Social Democrats and the Liberals to gain a
parliamentary majority and validate Victor Ponta as prime
minister on May 7, after toppling Ungureanu on April 27.  While in power, the Democrat-Liberals backed an austerity
plan that included a 25 percent cut in public wages and tax
increases to meet pledges to the  International Monetary Fund  and
the European Union under two accords since 2009.  Romania is expected to hold general elections in November
or December, according to Ponta, as the current ruling alliance,
known as USL, would win about 60 percent of the votes, according
to a May 9-15 survey, conducted by pollster IMAS on 1,038
people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
