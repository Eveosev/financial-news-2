Shareholders of  Bahrain ’s Capivest
BSC, Elaf Bank BSC and Capital Management House BSC approved a
merger of the three Islamic financial institutions as
competition intensifies in the Persian Gulf’s state.  The merger, which still needs approval from the kingdom’s
Central Bank and Ministry of Trade and Commerce, will create an
entity with equity of almost $350 million and assets of more
than $400 million,  Kuwait  Finance House Bahrain BSC said in an
e-mailed statement today.  The move aims “to establish a strong banking institution
that is able to compete solidly in a changing market,” Elaf
Bank’s Vice Chairman Isa Habib said, according to the statement.  Bahrain is home to the largest number of Islamic banks in
the  Persian Gulf  and the only nation in the six-member Gulf
Cooperation Council to issue domestic Islamic bills maturing in
less than a year, according to central bank data. The Accounting
& Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions, a
standard-setting body, is also based in Bahrain.  Bahrain Islamic Bank (BISB) , the second-biggest Shariah-compliant
lender in the nation, in February ended talks with  Al Salam Bank
BSC (SALAM)  over a possible merger that would have created a lender with
a market value of $400 million. Al Salam completed legal
requirements for its merger with Bahrain Saudi Bank BSC on April
25, according to a June 10 statement on the country’s bourse
website.  The three lenders appointed  Kuwait Finance House (KFIN)  in Bahrain
to act as adviser, Trowers & Hamlins as legal counsel and
Deloitte as independent valuer, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
