Play resumed at the third round of
the U.S.  PGA Tour ’s AT&T National after a six-hour delay caused
by an overnight storm so destructive that the golf course
prohibited fans from attending.  The storm knocked out power and uprooted trees both on the
course and along the roads leading to Congressional Country Club
in Bethesda,  Maryland , the PGA Tour said on its  website . Fans
and tournament volunteers were excluded from the ground in the
interest of safety, the tour said.  The round began at 1 p.m. local time, with players starting
on both the first and 10th tees in groups of three.  Hunter Mahan  holds a two-stroke lead over  Robert Garrigus ,
Jimmy Walker and Brandon de Jonge.  Tiger Woods  is five strokes
back in a tie for 11th place after shooting 68 yesterday.  PGA Tour meteorologist Stewart Williams said the storm is
called a Derecho, a Spanish terms that means “straight.”  “In weather terms, it’s a storm that goes at least 250
miles with winds at least 58 miles (93 kilometers) per hour or
better,” he said in a statement released by the PGA Tour.  According to Williams, the storm began in the Chicago area
and gained momentum as it moved east. By time it reached the
Washington area around 10:15 p.m. local time, the winds were
about 70 mph. The storm lasted 30 minutes, dropping only about
three-tenths of an inch of rain, before heading toward the
Atlantic Ocean.  “These things are more big wind-makers than rain-makers,”
Williams said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
