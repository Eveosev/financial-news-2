Laurent Blanc  won’t renew his
contract as coach of France’s national soccer team, the French
Football Federation said on its website.  Blanc, 46, led France to the quarterfinals of the 2012
European Championship before losing to Spain. France left the
tournament amid media reports of discord among the players.  Blanc replaced  Raymond Domenech  as coach after France was
knocked out of the 2010 World Cup at the group stage. He guided
the team on a 23-match unbeaten run, including a tie with
England and a win over co-host Ukraine at Euro 2012, before
losses to Sweden in the final group match and then to Spain.  The French federation said in a statement it would have no
further comment until after a meeting of its executive committee
in three days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
