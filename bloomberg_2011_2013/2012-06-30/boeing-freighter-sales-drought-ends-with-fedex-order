FedEx Corp. (FDX)  agreed to buy 19  Boeing
Co. (BA)  767 cargo jets, the first freighters the planemaker has sold
this year as shippers curbed purchases amid a slowing global
economy.  The Boeing 767s will be delivered from fiscal 2015 to 2019,
replacing Boeing MD-10 and A310 models from Airbus SAS, FedEx
said in a statement yesterday. The order has a catalog value of
 $3.3 billion , though customers typically negotiate discounts.  New jets will help profitability at FedEx, the world’s
largest cargo airline, by paring fuel costs as the economy
crimps express shipments of goods from cell phones to
pharmaceuticals. Air cargo fell 2.3 percent in the first four
months of the year from 2011, the  International Air Transport
Association  said.  “FedEx Express is positioning itself for more profitable
growth by modernizing its aircraft fleet and better aligning its
U.S. domestic air network to match current and anticipated
shipment volumes,” said David J. Bronczek, head of FedEx
Express.  The 767s will be about 30 percent more fuel-efficient than
the MD10 jets they’re replacing, helping to reduce unit
operating costs more than 20 percent, FedEx said.  FedEx also agreed to convert four orders for 777
freighters, with a list value of $1.1 billion, to an equivalent
purchase order for 767s. The  Memphis , Tennessee-based company’s
large planes now include Airbus A300s and A310s that are more
than 25 years old.  FedEx Forecast  The shipping company retired 24 jets earlier this month to
cut capacity in its domestic Express division. Taking them out
of service added to five jets grounded last quarter and planned
retirements of 21 more in FedEx’s 2013 fiscal year.  FedEx on June 19  predicted profit  of $6.90 to $7.40 a share
in the fiscal year through May, compared with an average
estimate of $7.38 from analysts.  Revenue and earnings growth will be impacted by “weaker
economic conditions” such as the  European debt crisis , and
slowing growth in  Asia , executives said on an earnings call at
the time. Customers are shifting from premium to deferred
products as they seek to reduce shipping expenses, a trend
expected to continue in 2013, executives said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
