(Corrects Evans’s time in third paragraph.)  Switzerland’s Fabian Cancellara won
today’s prologue at the 99th Tour de  France .  RadioShack team rider Cancellara had a time of 7 minutes,
13 seconds in the 6.4-kilometer (4-mile) time trial around the
streets of Liege, Belgium. Britain’s Bradley Wiggins of the Sky
team, the bookmakers’ race favorite, was seven seconds back in
second.  Defending champion  Cadel Evans  of BMC Racing finished 13th
with a time of 7 minutes, 30 seconds. The Australian became the
first winner from the southern hemisphere in race history last
year.  Tomorrow’s first stage is a 226-kilometer ride from Liege
to Seraing. The 3,497-kilometer race ends on the Champs-Élysées
in Paris on July 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
