Hunter Mahan  withstood a heat index
of 109 degrees (43 Celsius) to shoot a 6-under 65 and take a
two-stroke lead going into the third round of the AT&T National.  Mahan finished the second round at 7-under 135, while  Tiger Woods  shot a 3-under-par 68 to stand five back after 36 holes at
Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland.  “It wasn’t like a hard round,” Mahan told reporters
yesterday. “I hit so many fairways and greens, I made it easy
on myself. I put myself in some great spots to make putts.”  Brendon de Jonge and Jimmy Walker each carded 2-under 69s
to tie for second place at 5-under. They were joined by  Robert Garrigus , who had a 4-under 67 in round two.  “I didn’t quite hit it as good today as I did yesterday,
but got a lot out of the round, got pretty much everything out
of the round I could have gotten out of it, lots of good up-and-
downs, lots of good putts,” Walker said.  The  National Weather Service  said it will be sunny and hot
today with a high near 99 degrees and heat index values as high
as 104.  “You play well in the heat because you don’t think about
it,” Garrigus said. “It’s one of those things where if you can
just get past the fact you’re dripping sweat all over your golf
ball, you can block it out.”  Former British Open champion  Stewart Cink  shot a 3-under 68
to share fifth place at 4-under par 138 with  Vijay Singh , Rod Pampling, Pat Perez and Seung-Yul Noh.  Woods is tied with first-round leader Bo Van Pelt, who
posted a 2-over 73 for a 2-under-par 140 after two rounds.
 Charley Hoffman  and Marc Leishman also are at 140.  “It was one of those days,” Woods said. “I was
consistent most of the day. I made a couple good par saves at 13
and 14, and I made a big putt there at 16.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
