Royal Mail Group is uprepared to be
taken private even as earnings improve, the Financial Times
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Moya Greene.  The Government-backed mail operator posted an operating
profit of 23 million pounds ($36.1 million) and revenue of 7.2
billion pounds in the year ended March 25 in its letters and
parcels unit, the FT said.  The unit posted a loss of 120 million pounds in the year
before, the FT said. Royal Mail has more to achieve before being
“worthy of outside capital,” the FT said, citing Greene.  To contact the reporters on this story:
