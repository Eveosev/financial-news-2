Rwanda must stop its support for a
rebellion in eastern  Democratic Republic  of Congo that has
displaced more than 200,000 people, the U.S. State Department
said in an e-mailed statement.  An addendum to a report by the United Nations Group of
Experts on Congo accused top Rwandan officials including its
Minister of Defense of coordinating military operations with
several Congolese rebel groups. Rwanda has denied the
allegations.  “We are deeply concerned about the report’s findings that
Rwanda is implicated in the provision of support to Congolese
rebel groups,” State Department spokeswoman  Victoria Nuland 
said in the statement. The U.S. has “asked Rwanda to halt and
prevent the provision of such support from its territory.”  The current rebellion in Congo’s mineral-rich east began in
March when General Bosco Ntaganda, who is wanted by the
 International Criminal Court  for war crimes, deserted the army
amid rumors that he would be arrested. Congo’s government
accused the U.S. of blocking the release of the UN’s evidence of
Rwanda’s support for Ntaganda in a June 20 statement. The U.S.
denied the claim.  Congo and neighboring Rwanda fought a series of wars
directly or via rebel proxies beginning in the late 1990s until
a 2009 peace agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
