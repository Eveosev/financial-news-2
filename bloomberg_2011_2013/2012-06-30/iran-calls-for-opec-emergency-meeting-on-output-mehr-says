Iran  called on OPEC to hold an
emergency meeting to address the group’s production of crude in
excess of the targeted 30 million barrels a day, Mehr news
agency reported, citing the country’s Oil Minister.   Disregard of the target by some members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries “will negatively impact  oil
prices  in the international market,” Rostam Qasemi said,
according to the state-run agency’s report today. “The
organization’s members must respect the production ceiling to
maintain the supply and demand in oil markets,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
