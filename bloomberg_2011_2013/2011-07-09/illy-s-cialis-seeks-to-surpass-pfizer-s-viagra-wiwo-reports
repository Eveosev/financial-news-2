Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY)  expects its Cialis
impotence drug to surpass  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s Viagra this year in the
prescription market, Wirtschaftswoche  reported , citing Chief
Executive Officer John Lechleiter.  Cialis is ahead in markets including France, Italy, South
Africa and Australia, Lechleiter said in a report on the German
magazine’s website. The company has plans to sell the drug also
for other treatments, including prostatic hyperplasia, which
U.S. regulators are expected to give clearance for this year, he
told the magazine.  Lechleiter rejected reports that Lilly is thinking of
merging with other companies, including Bayer AG, the magazine
