Munich Re’s Ergo Versicherungsgruppe
AG hasn’t experienced a decline in sales after two recent
scandals, Boersen-Zeitung reported on its  website , citing Chief
Financial Officer Christoph Jurecka.  Flaws in so-called Riester insurance contracts as well as
the presence of prostitutes at a party for sales agents may
still lead to negative impacts, the German newspaper cited
Jurecka as saying. The company will nevertheless reach its 2011
profit target of 450 million euros ($642 million) to 550 million
euros, the executive said, according to Boersen-Zeitung.  To contact the reporter on this story:
