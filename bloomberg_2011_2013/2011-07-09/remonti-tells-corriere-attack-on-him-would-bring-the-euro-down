Italian Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti  said a political attack leading to his resignation may
damage both Italian bonds and the euro, Corriere della Sera
reported, citing an interview.  Such an attack may “bring the euro down,” Milan-based
Corriere cited Tremonti as saying. “Tremonti’s surplus value is
made of the spread between Italian and German government bonds
which so far remained on safety levels, his depreciation is made
of what may happen” in the future, the minister added,
according to the daily.
