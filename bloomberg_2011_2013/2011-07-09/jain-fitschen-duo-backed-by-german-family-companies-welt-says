The plan to name  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) 
investment-banking head Anshu Jain co-chief executive officer
alongside Juergen Fitschen is backed by German family-owned
companies, Die Welt  reported .  Appointing Fitschen would underline the roots of the bank
and be a “good signal” for medium-size companies, the
newspaper cited Brun-Hagen Hennerkes, head of the foundation for
family-owned companies in  Germany , in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
