RWE AG (RWE)  Chief Executive Officer
Juergen Grossmann is considering  Gazprom OAO (GAZP)  as an investor for
the German utility,  Der Spiegel  reported, citing unidentified
people familiar with the issue.  Grossmann met Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller in Paris yesterday
to discuss possible cooperation, the magazine said on its
website. Since Germany decided to exit nuclear power production,
RWE is seeking a new strategy and Grossmann is considering
having Gazprom buy a stake in the company or its units,
according to Der Spiegel.  Miller also met with  E.ON AG (EOAN)  Chief Executive Officer
Johannes Teyssen on July 7 to discuss similar issues, the
magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
