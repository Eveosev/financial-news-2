Ghana ’s ruling party overwhelmingly
chose President John Evans Atta Mills as its candidate for the
2012 election, rejecting a bid by Nana Kunadu Agyeman Rawlings,
the wife of the party’s founder, Jerry John Rawlings.  Mills won with 96.9 percent of the vote to Rawlings’ 3.1
percent at a primary of the National Democratic Congress, the
Ghana Electoral Commission said today. The conference was held
in the town of Sunyani, 400 kilometers (249 miles) north of the
capital, Accra.  The president will probably face Nana Akufo-Addo of the
opposition New Patriotic Party in the 2012 election, four years
after beating him 50.23 percent to 49.77 percent in a run-off
vote in December 2008. Mills oversaw economic growth of 23
percent in the first quarter as the West African nation began
producing oil for export.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
