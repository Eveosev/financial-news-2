Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  has lost market share in
Swedish housing loans after tightening requirements in May 2009,
 Svenska Dagbladet  reported, citing an interview with Chief
Executive Officer Michael Wolf.  Other Swedish banks will now follow with limits on some
loans as the countryâ€™s housing market has started to weaken,
Wolf said, according to the Stockholm-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
