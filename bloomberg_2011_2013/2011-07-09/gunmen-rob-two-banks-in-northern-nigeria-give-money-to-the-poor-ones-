Suspected Islamic militants attacked
two banks and a police station in northern  Nigeria  and then gave
the cash to poor people in the area, a local official said.  The attack by a group of about 10 gunmen occurred at 6 p.m.
yesterday in Alkaleri, a town in the northern state of Bauchi,
said Mua’zu Haruna, a local government official. The gunmen were
seen distributing money from the banks to local people, saying
they had come to “help the poor ones,” Haruna said.  Nigerian authorities blame a radical Islamic sect known as
Boko Haram for a series of attacks on government officials and
security forces in the north. The group, modeled after
 Afghanistan ’s Taliban, claimed responsibility for a June 16
blast at the national police headquarters in the capital, Abuja,
which killed at least five people and injured 11.  Africa ’s top oil producer and most populous country is
split between a mainly Muslim north and a predominantly
Christian south. More than 14,000 people died in ethnic and
religious clashes in the West African nation between 1999 and
2009, according to Brussels-based  International Crisis Group .  To contact the reporter on this story:
