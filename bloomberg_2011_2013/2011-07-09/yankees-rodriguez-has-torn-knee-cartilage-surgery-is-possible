New York Yankees third baseman Alex
Rodriguez has torn cartilage in his right knee and has to decide
whether to undergo surgery.  Rodriguez had an MRI exam yesterday which revealed a slight
meniscus tear, Yankees manager  Joe Girardi  said on the Major
League Baseball team’s website. He’d likely miss a month if he
has surgery now or he could wait until the end of the season,
according to Girardi.  “I’m going to talk to Alex and see how he feels and what
he thinks and them form my opinion on it,” Girardi said. “I
don’t want to influence his decision. That’s only something that
he can evaluate, so I want to listen to him and then discuss it
with him.”  The Yankees announced yesterday that Rodriguez and
shortstop  Derek Jeter  wouldn’t play in the July 12 All-Star
game, without giving a reason. Both were chosen to start for the
 American League  by the fans.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
