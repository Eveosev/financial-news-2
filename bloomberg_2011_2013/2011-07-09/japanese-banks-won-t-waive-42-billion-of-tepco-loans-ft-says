Japanese banks won’t waive loans made
to  Tokyo Electric  Power Co. even though a government rescue plan
for the utility may hinge on them doing so, the head of the
Japanese Bankers Association told the Financial Times.  A debt waiver is “inconceivable,” Katsunori Nagayasu,
chairman of the association, said in an interview with the paper.
The comment illustrates the concern about the outlook for Tokyo
Electric and its implication for  Japan ’s largest banks and
insurers, the  newspaper  said.  Japan’s banks and insurance companies have made 3.4
trillion yen ($42 billion) of loans to the utility known as
Tepco and may hold a large part of its 4.4 trillion yens in
outstanding bonds, the newspaper said.  The government has previously suggested that the waiver of
outstanding loans by Japan’s banks may be a condition for
financial support of Tepco, the newspaper said. Such a move
would “destabilize the financial system considerably,”
Nagayasu, also president of  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) ,
Japan’s biggest publicly traded bank, told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
