Chicago businessman Matthew Hulsizer
may offer as much as $170 million to buy the  St. Louis Blues ,
Toronto’s  Globe & Mail reported , citing a person familiar with
the National Hockey League team.  Hulsizer, chairman of Peak6 Corp., would be offering more
than the $120 million loan taken out by Blues Chairman Dave Checketts when he and TowerBrook Capital Partners bought the
team for $150 million in 2006, the newspaper said.  TowerBrook Capital, which owns 70 percent of the team, said
last year it wanted to sell its stake. Checketts and his company,
SCP Worldwide, added their minority share to the sale.  Checketts said there were three “very strong” bidders for
the team, the newspaper said. Besides Hulsizer, minority owner
Tom Stillman is interested although his initial offer was
rejected by the NHL, the Globe & Mail said, citing the
unidentified person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
