Doughty Hanson & Co., a U.K. private
equity firm, is looking to hire an investment bank to conduct a
review of its Tumi luggage business, Sky News reported on its
website, without saying where it obtained the information.  A sale for the business was not imminent, Sky said, citing
people familiar with the situation. Doughty Hanson bought the
luxury luggage company for $276 million in 2004.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
