ISS Holding A/S, the world’s largest
provider of cleaning services, will double its workforce in
 India  to 100,000 within a few years,  Berlingske  reported, citing
Chief Financial Officer Jakob Stausholm.  ISS’s India unit grows faster than the country’s economy
and the company will expand by at least 10 percent a year over
the next decade as more firms outsource cleaning services,
Stausholm said, according to Copenhagen-based Berlingske.  To contact the reporter on this story:
