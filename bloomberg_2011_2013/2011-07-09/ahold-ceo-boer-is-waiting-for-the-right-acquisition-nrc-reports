Royal Ahold NV Chief Executive
Officer  Dick Boer  said the company has the financial means for
growth and is waiting for the right opportunity and the right
time for an acquisition, NRC Handelsblad reported.  The company has three criteria for acquisitions,  De Boer 
said in an interview with the Dutch daily. Takeover targets must
be easy to integrate into the company, they must fit with
Aholdâ€™s goal of becoming first or second in all its markets, and
they must be affordable, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
