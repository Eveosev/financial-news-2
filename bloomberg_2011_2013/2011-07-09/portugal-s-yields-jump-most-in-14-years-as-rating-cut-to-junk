Portuguese bond yields posted their
biggest weekly gain in more than 14 years after the nation’s
credit rating was cut to junk by Moody’s Investors Service,
reigniting concern the euro-region debt crisis is spreading.  Italian and Spanish bonds dropped while German bunds gained
for the fourth week in five as European officials remained at
loggerheads over the best way to solve the crisis and prevent
 Greece  from a disorderly default. Dutch Finance Minister  Jan Kees de Jager  said private investors may have to be forced into
contributing to a new aid package for Greece. The  European
Central Bank  raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis
points to 1.50 percent on July 7.  “The downgrade of Portugal triggered spread-widening in
peripheral debt,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-income
strategist at Commerzbank AG in London. “Portuguese bonds will
be dropped out of some indexes, which will lead to some forced
selling. There’s been a spill-over impact on Spain and Italy as
well, and that’s being compounded by the supply coming up next
week in a challenging environment.”  Portugal ’s two-year note yield climbed 453 basis points
over the week to 17.50 percent as of 4:55 p.m. in London
yesterday. That’s the biggest weekly increase since at least
April 1996, when Bloomberg began collecting the data. The yield
reached a euro-era record of 18.28 percent on July 7. The
nation’s 10-year yields climbed 199 basis points, the biggest
weekly advance since at least 1997.  Italian Bonds Fall  Portugal’s 10-year yield spread over benchmark government
bunds widened to a record 1,013 basis points on July 6, a day
after the nation’s credit rating was cut. The long-term
government bond ratings were lowered to Ba2, or junk, with a
negative outlook, from Baa1, Moody’s said, citing concern the
country will need to follow Greece in seeking a second bailout.  Italy ’s bonds sank, pushing the 10-year yield up 40 basis
points to 5.27 percent, the most since 2002, as the nation’s
bank stocks tumbled even as Bank of Italy Governor  Mario Draghi 
said he’s certain the lenders will pass stress tests.  The German-Italian 10-year yield spread touched 247 basis
points, the most since at least January 2010.  Italy’s bonds may decline next week as the nation sells
securities maturing in 2016, 2017, 2023 and 2026. Greece plans
to auction 1.25 billion euros of 26-week Treasury bills on July
12, according to the Athens-based Public Debt Management Agency.
Greece plans to sell Treasury bills.  German  government bonds  have handed investors a gain of 0.5
percent this year, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while
Italian bonds have returned 0.1 percent. Greece’s debt has
dropped 17 percent and Portugal’s has declined 28 percent, the
indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
