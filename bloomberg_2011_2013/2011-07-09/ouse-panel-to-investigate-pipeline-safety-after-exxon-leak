A U.S. House of Representatives
subcommittee will probe pipeline safety next week as  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)  works to clean up a 1,000-barrel July 1 oil spill in
Montana’s Yellowstone River.  The House Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and
Hazardous Materials  said  it will hold the pipeline safety
hearing July 14 in  Washington . Congressman Denny Rehberg, a
Montana Republican, said on his Senate campaign website that he
had requested the hearing to examine the Irving, Texas-based
company’s pipeline leak near Laurel, Montana.  “We have received 263 calls from the community,” Exxon
said in a statement yesterday, which said that about 500 people
are involved in the cleanup effort. “Our team is responding to
approximately 85 claims related to property, agriculture and
health.”  The Silvertip line, which was transporting about 40,000
barrels a day prior to the leak, runs 69 miles (111 kilometers)
from Elk Basin,  Wyoming , to Exxon’s refinery in Billings,
Montana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
