Electricite de  France  is preparing to
order 44 replacement steam generators for its nuclear  power
plants , and French nuclear supplier Areva will get about two-
thirds of the order, the newspaper Le Figaro said, without
saying where it got the information.  State-controlled EDF has said it plans to spend 35 billion
euros ($50 billion) to extend the operational lifetime of its
existing reactors, half of which have reached the point where
major parts such as generators need replacing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
