Japan upset two-time defending
champion  Germany  1-0 after extra time to reach the semifinals of
soccer’s Women’s  World Cup .  Karina Maruyama scored in the 108th minute to give Japan
the victory in Wolfsburg, Germany. The loss ended Germany’s 15-
match unbeaten run at the World Cup, dating back to a
quarterfinal loss to the U.S. in 1999.  France also moved into the final four by beating England 4-
3 in a penalty shootout. The game went to penalties after
finishing 1-1.  Japan will next play the winner of tomorrow’s quarterfinal
between Sweden or Australia, while France faces either Brazil or
two-time winner U.S.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
