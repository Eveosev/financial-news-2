William Morrison Supermarkets Plc may
bid for some individual stores from Iceland Foods Ltd., the
U.K.-based frozen-food chain, the Financial Times reported,
citing Chief Executive Officer Dalton Philips.  The retailer is “a long way off” from hiring advisers for
a potential bid, Philips said, according to the newspaper. It
will “look at any opportunity,” he said, the Financial Times
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
