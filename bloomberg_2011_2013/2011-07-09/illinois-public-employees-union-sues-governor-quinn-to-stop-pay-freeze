Illinois  Governor  Pat Quinn  was sued
by a public employees union seeking to reverse an order freezing
the pay of 30,000 government workers.  The American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees, in a complaint filed yesterday in federal court in
Springfield, Illinois, asked for a court finding that the
state’s pay freeze, imposed July 1, violates the union’s
collective bargaining agreement.  The union said in its complaint that the employees have a
contractual right to receive a 2 percent pay raise, which along
with longevity-based increases, would cost about $75 million,
according to state estimates. The union also said the freeze is
unfair because some workers in the 14 departments and agencies
subject to it do the same kind of jobs as employees in other
departments that aren’t affected.  “Paying employees different wages when they have the same
classification” and duties “is unreasonable and arbitrary,”
according to the complaint.  Grant Klinzman, a spokesman for the governor, said in an
e-mail that increasing salaries now would mean that the 14
agencies wouldn’t be able to meet payroll through the entire
2012 fiscal year  “The administration will take the necessary steps to
manage the fiscal year 2012 budget,” Klinzman said.  The case is Council 31 of the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO v. Quinn, 11-03203, U.S.
District Court, Central District of Illinois (Springfield).  To contact the reporter on this story:
