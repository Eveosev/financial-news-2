The Labour party “lost the driving
rhythm” that made it successful when  Gordon Brown  took over as
leader, former U.K. Labour Prime Minister  Tony Blair  said in a
speech in London, according to the  Guardian .  The Labour government should be remembered in two phases,
Blair said, according to the newspaper, his own, which lasted
from 1997 to 2007, and Brown’s, from 2007 to 2010.  “We lost the driving rhythm that made us different and
successful,” Blair said, according to the Guardian. “It was
not a government of continuity from 1997 to 2010 pursuing the
same politics.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
