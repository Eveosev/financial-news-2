U.S. stocks rose this week, giving
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index its biggest rally in 21 months,
as gains in technology and commodity companies were enough to
overcome yesterday’s drop following the worst monthly jobs
report since September.  The S&P 500 lost 0.7 percent yesterday after American
employers added 83 percent fewer jobs in June than economists
forecast. Computer, materials and energy companies in the index
advanced 0.9 percent or more this week, the most among 10
groups.  Target Corp. (TGT)  and Limited Brands Inc. rose 6.7 percent
and 4.4 percent, respectively, after the retailers topped sales
projections, helping drive the industry to a record high.  The S&P 500 advanced 0.3 percent to 1,343.80 this week,
extending its climb since June 24 to 5.9 percent. That’s the
biggest two-week increase since October 2009. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  gained 74.43 points, or 0.6 percent, to
12,657.20. Both measures rallied even after Moody’s Investors
Service cut Portugal’s debt rating to junk.  “We’ve had a pretty good run up,” said Stephen Solaka,
who oversees about $50 million as co-founder of Belmont Capital
Group in Los Angeles. “Given the jobs number, the sell-off is
pretty muted. The market is shrugging off a lot of anxiety in
the economy and in Europe.”  Equities have rebounded in July after the  S&P 500  tumbled
3.2 percent in May and June. Before yesterday’s drop, the index
was 10.39 points away from its April 29 close, which was the
highest level in almost three years. The jobs report hurt
companies most tied to the economy, with financial and
industrial stocks slipping 1.1 percent or more.  Cyclical Trend  Losses in companies reliant on economic growth yesterday
represented a reversal from the past three weeks. The Morgan
Stanley Cyclical Index tracking manufacturers, commodity
producers and transportation stocks rose 10 percent between June
16 and July 7, beating the Morgan Stanley Consumer Index of
drugmakers and grocers by 6.6 percentage points. Amid concern
the debt crisis in European nations including  Greece  would slow
global growth, the consumer index outperformed the cyclical
index by 9.7 points between Feb. 17 and June 16.  The S&P 500 dropped the most in two weeks yesterday after
Labor Department data showed U.S. employers added 18,000 workers
in June, the fewest in nine months and less than the most
pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.
The median forecast was for growth of 105,000. The jobless rate
rose to a 2011 high of 9.2 percent.  “The number is horribly disappointing,” said Todd Schoenberger, LandColt Trading LLC managing director in Lewes,
Delaware. “The monthly jobs figure continues to frustrate
Americans and the short-term outlook appears to be dire.”  Technology companies in the S&P 500 rose the most among 10
groups, climbing 1.6 percent.  Technology, Energy Shares  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the world’s biggest software maker, posted
the biggest gain in the Dow, rising 3.5 percent to $26.92.  Intel
Corp. (INTC) , the world’s largest chipmaker, climbed 2.5 percent for
the second-biggest increase in the Dow to $23.09.  International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM) , the world’s largest computer-services
company, advanced 1.1 percent to $176.49.  Energy shares in the S&P 500 added 0.9 percent as crude oil
for August delivery rose 1.3 percent.  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-
largest U.S. oil company, jumped 1.7 percent to $105.89.
Retailers in the S&P 500 rallied 2.7 percent, climbing to a
record high on July 7, as discounts and lower gas prices in the
U.S. enticed consumers to spend last month. Target rose 6.7
percent to $51.14, and Limited Brands gained 4.4 percent to
$40.62. Clothing retailer  Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN)  rallied 11
percent, the most in the S&P 500, to $32.03 after Morgan Stanley
recommended investors buy the shares. Morgan Stanley raised the
stock to “overweight” from “equal weight.”  Bank Shares  Department-store chain  Kohl’s Corp. (KSS)  climbed 6.6 percent to
$55.18 as June retail sales surpassed analysts’ projections.  The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  fell 1.8 percent as 19 of its 24
companies dropped.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the largest U.S.
lender, lost 3.5 percent, the biggest decline in the Dow, to
$10.70.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, dropped 2 percent to $40.74.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , which rose 0.4 percent to $16.38 this week,
will become the first Dow company to report second-quarter
earnings on July 11. Corporate profits are forecast to have
grown by 13 percent in the period, according to analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg, the smallest gain in two years.  “We’re going to see the end of the period of positive
surprises,” said  Hayes Miller , Boston-based head of asset
allocation in  North America  at Baring Asset Management Inc.,
which oversees $51.5 billion. “Consumption is going to really
be a very low level of growth for the next year and a half.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
