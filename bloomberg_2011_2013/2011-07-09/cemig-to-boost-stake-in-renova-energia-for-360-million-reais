Cia. Energetica de Minas Gerais, the
state-controlled utility known as Cemig, will pay 360 million
reais to add voting shares of renewable energy company Renova
Energia SA, according to a regulatory filing.  Cemig unit Light SA, a Rio de Janeiro-based energy
distributor, will increase its stake to 35.1 percent of voting
shares and 26.2 percent of Renova, the companies said in filings
late yesterday.  The transaction must be approved by the nationâ€™s energy
regulator, known as Aneel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
