Total SA (FP) ,  Europe ’s largest oil
refiner, is no longer in exclusive discussions to sell its
Lindsey refinery in the U.K. and there are several bidders
involved in the process, Total said today.  The sale process for the facility will be slightly delayed,
Chief Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie said at an event
in Aix-en-Provence.  De Margerie previously indicated he wanted to complete the
transaction by the end of last year, and Chief Financial Officer
Patrick de la Chevardiere said in April that the disposal would
be “a matter of one or two months.”  With the sale of Lindsey, Total would complete a plan to
cut capacity by about one-fifth, or 500,000 barrels a day. The
French  oil company  this year sold its 49 percent stake in Cia.
Espanola de Petroleos SA for 3.97 billion euros ($5.66 billion).
Last year it shut its Dunkirk plant in  France  and entered a
refining and marketing venture with ERG SpA in Italy.  De Margerie also said that Total intends to pursue asset
sale plans for 2011. These were previously expected to be worth
about $10 billion this year, although de Margerie declined to
reiterate that target today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
