NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy, Ukraine’s
state-run energy company, will be able to restart natural-gas
shipments to Poland after President  Viktor Yanukovych  signed a
law allowing exports of domestic reserves,  Gazeta Wyborcza 
reported.  Naftogaz halted deliveries to Poland at the start of this
year as a law regulating the Ukrainian gas market didn’t permit
export of locally extracted fuel and the country couldn’t ship
imported gas, the  newspaper  said, citing Naftogaz.  The company can still decide to re-block the deliveries,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
