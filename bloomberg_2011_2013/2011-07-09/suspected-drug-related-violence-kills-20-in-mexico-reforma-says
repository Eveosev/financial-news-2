More than twenty people were killed
and at least five injured at a bar in Monterrey,  Mexico , in a
suspected territorial dispute between drug cartels, Reforma
reported, citing a source in the Nuevo Leon state attorneyâ€™s
office that it did not identify.  A group of armed people arrived in three vehicles, entered
the bar in the center of Monterrey at 9:30 p.m. local time and
started shooting, the Mexico City-based  newspaper said . The bar
is considered a central meeting place for members of the Los
Zetas group and the attack was likely by a rival cartel, the
Cartel del Golfo, Reforma said.  The number of people killed in that area so far this year
has reached 909, the second highest murder rate in the country,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
