Tokyo  is the world’s most expensive
city, with prices relative to other locations boosted by the
yen’s strength, according to data compiled by the Economist
Intelligence Unit.  The Japanese capital topped a list of cities with the
highest cost of living for the second consecutive year, the
report said, followed by Oslo, Japan’s Osaka Kobe, Paris and
Zurich. For the twice-a-year report, the research group said it
collects 400 prices from 140 cities and compares them by
converting them to dollars. Japan’s currency has strengthened
almost 11 percent against the dollar in the past two years and
17 percent against the euro, Bloomberg data shows.  “The yen has strengthened significantly over the past two
years, pushing Tokyo back to the top of the ranking,” the
report said. “ Osaka  in Japan shares Tokyo’s inherent
costliness.”  The appreciation of the Australian dollar over the past two
years has pushed Sydney to sixth place from 32nd place, the
report said, and  Melbourne  to seventh from 38th. Australia’s
currency has appreciated almost 28 percent during that period,
Bloomberg data shows.  Karachi in Pakistan is the cheapest location surveyed, with
a cost of living one-third that of Tokyo, the survey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
