Arab Potash Co. (APOT)  signed a $145 million
contract with  Sinofert Holdings Ltd. (297) ,  China ’s biggest fertilizer
importer, to supply the Chinese market with 300,000 tons of
potash this year.  The agreement is part of a long-term memorandum of
understanding under which Jordan will supply China with regular
shipments of potash until 2013, Amman-based Arab Potash said in
a statement on its  website .  Among APC’s shareholders are the Potash Corporation of
Saskatchewan,  Canada , which has a 27.96 percent stake, and the
government of Jordan, which holds 26.88 percent of APC.  China is among countries that are becoming more reliant on
fertilizers to boost crop yields as the availability of arable
land shrinks and populations grow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
