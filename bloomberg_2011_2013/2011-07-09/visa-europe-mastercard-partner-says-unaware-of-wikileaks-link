Valitor , a payment processor linked
to Visa  Europe  and MasterCard, said it didn’t know it would be
briefly channeling donations to WikiLeaks this week.  The company, based in Reykjavik, Iceland, said it suspended
an agreement with WikiLeaks’s payment provider, DataCell, when
it discovered it was collecting funds for the group. Visa
Europe, which runs the largest card network in the European
Union, said it stopped payments to WikiLeaks yesterday.  “Valitor was not informed that DataCell would be
conducting these activities when their business agreement was
made,” the company said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  London-based Visa Europe Ltd. and MasterCard in December
blocked WikiLeaks from using its network to collect funds from
donors.  WikiLeaks , led by Julian Assange, publishes secret
documents, including confidential U.S. diplomatic and military
information. Purchase, New York-based MasterCard’s website was
attacked by hackers in retaliation as recently as last month.  DataCell Chief Executive Andreas Fink said in an e-mail
yesterday the company may have received “five-to-six digit
figures” in WikiLeaks donations before payments were halted.  The WikiLeaks Twitter account posted a message on July 7
about the “Financial block workaround,” urging supporters to
“donate whilst you can.”  MasterCard, the world’s second-biggest payments network,
said it had never changed its policy on accepting WikiLeaks
donations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
