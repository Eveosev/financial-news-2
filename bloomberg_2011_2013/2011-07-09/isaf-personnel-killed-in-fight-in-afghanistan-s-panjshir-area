An International Security Assistance
Force soldier and a civilian worker were killed in an incident
in the northern Panjshir province, an ISAF spokesman said.  The incident is under investigation, Lt. Col. David Doherty
said today by a phone. He was unable to provide more
information.  Local officials earlier said two U.S. soldiers were killed
in a dispute with a bodyguard working for  Afghanistan ’s National
Directorate of Security. The incident took place at 8:45 a.m.
local time in the Dara district of the province as the
bodyguard, whose name is Amanullah, was travelling back to work
after a weekend holiday, according to Abdul Rehman, the deputy
provincial governor. The guard was also killed in the firefight.  “Two U.S. troops were killed and another wounded as an
employee of NDS opened fire after a dispute,” Rehman said today
in a phone interview. The soldiers were part of the Provincial
Reconstruction Team, or PRT, he said.  Mohammad Qasim Jangalbagh, the police chief of the
province, said that Amanullah was a bodyguard for Hessamudin
Hesam, the deputy chief of the Afghan spy agency.  Zabihullah Mujahed, a Taliban spokesman, claimed
responsibility.  “Our Mujahedeen destroyed their two vehicles and killed
three PRT members and wounded four others in an ambush today
early morning in Dara district,” he said by phone. “One of our
Mujahedeen was shot dead.”  Panjshir is one the most secure province in the country and
the only province not occupied by the Taliban 1996 to 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
