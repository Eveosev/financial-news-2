Google Inc. (GOOG)  is readying business-
focused features for the Google+ social-networking site,
potentially opening up new competition with Facebook Inc.’s
company pages and sites such as LinkedIn Corp.  The business tools are expected to be available later this
year, said Christian Oestlien, a product manager at  Mountain
View , California-based Google.  “Right now we’re very much focused on optimizing for the
consumer experience, but we have a great team of engineers
building a similarly optimized business experience for Google+,"
Oestlien said on a YouTube video.  Google+ was unveiled June 28, marking a fresh attempt to
compete with Facebook’s site. The service has similar features
as Facebook, with streaming updates of photos, messages,
comments and other content from selected groups of friends.  Google has set up a test version for businesses, Oestlien
said. It will link up with existing Google services, such as its
AdWords advertising system for Internet searches.  “It’ll include things like rich analytics and the ability
to connect that identity to other parts of Google that
businesses might use on a daily basis like AdWords,” he said.  Google has struggled to handle demand for Google+, which
for now is an invitation-only service. Oestlien recommended that
businesses not create Google+ accounts with the current consumer
version.  Google’s shares fell $14.61, or 2.7 percent, to $531.99
yesterday in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The stock has declined
10 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
