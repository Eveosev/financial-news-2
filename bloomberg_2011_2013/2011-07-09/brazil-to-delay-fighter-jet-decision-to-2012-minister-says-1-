Brazil will delay a decision on a
$5 billion order for new fighter jets to early next year,
Defense Minister Nelson Azevedo Jobim said.  “Wait until next year,” Azevedo Jobim told journalists
today in Aix-en-Provence, France.  “Now we have a domestic
agenda” to focus on, he said.  Boeing Co. (BA)  of the U.S. is pitching its F/A-18 Super Hornet,
while France’s  Dassault Aviation SA (AM)  is attempting to sell its
Rafale jet to the government. Swedish manufacturer  Saab AB (SAABB)  is
touting its Gripen aircraft for the order.  To contact the reporter on this story:
