Houston Rockets center  Yao Ming  plans
to announce his retirement from the  National Basketball
Association , the official Xinhua News Agency reported today.  Yao, 30, will discuss his “personal future development
plan” at a meeting with reporters arranged for July 20,
according to the report, citing an unidentified source close to
the 7-foot-6, 310-pound player.  The basketball star played an important role in promoting
the NBA in  Asia  when he joined the Rockets from China as the No.
1 pick in the 2002 draft. He hasn’t been able to recover from
surgery in January to repair a stress fracture in his left foot,
according to a Yahoo! Sports report.  “We’ve not received any official notification of his
retirement,” said Bo-Ning Yang, a Beijing-based spokesman for
 NBA China , in an e-mailed response to a Bloomberg News request
for more information.  Yao will retire after nine seasons in the NBA,  NBA.com 
reported on its website yesterday, citing unidentified “league
sources.”  China ’s most famous basketball player travelled to Beijing
two weeks ago to inform the Chinese Basketball Association of
his decision, Xinhua reported.  --Liza Lin, with assistance from Curtis Eichelberger. Editors:
