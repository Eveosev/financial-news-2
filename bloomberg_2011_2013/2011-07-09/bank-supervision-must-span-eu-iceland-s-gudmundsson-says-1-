Banks’ ability to operate throughout
the European Union must be matched with supervision and
regulation that spans the bloc, Icelandic Central Bank Governor
Mar Gudmundsson said.  “We can’t have a level playing field for banks within
 Europe ” without supervision, Gudmundsson said today at an
economics conference in Aix-en-Provence, France. “Those banks
that want the European passport would be licensed and supervised
by a European authority.”  Iceland, where  currency devaluation  helped generate a trade
surplus that revived the country after its 2008 financial
meltdown, is seeking to join the EU and adopt the euro to limit
future crises. Still, the 27-nation group needs closer
regulatory integration, Gudmundsson said.  “As long as the global risks and the EU flaws aren’t dealt
with, then individual countries are forced to protect
themselves,” he said. “The size of national banking system
relative to GDP will be a concern.”  Gudmundsson spoke at a conference organized by  France ’s
Cercle des Economistes.  To contact the reporters for this story:
