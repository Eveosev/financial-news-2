Buenos Aires ’s two airports resumed
flights late yesterday after an ash cloud from a volcanic
eruption in southern  Chile  prompted cancellations yesterday.  Most domestic and international flights from Ezeiza
international airport, and the city’s smaller Jorge Newberry
airport, resumed, according to airport operator Aeropuertos
 Argentina  2000 SA’s website.  Aerolineas Argentinas SA, the country’s biggest airline,
 AMR Corp. (AMR) ’s American Airlines, Alitalia SpA, Iberia and  Air
France-KLM (AF)  Group all reported cancellations or delays in flights
to and from Buenos Aires on July 7.  Chile’s Puyehue-Cordon Caulle volcanic complex began to
erupt on June 4, generating ash clouds that led to flight
cancellations because of concerns that they may clog  jet
engines .  Argentina declared an agriculture emergency in June in the
southern provinces of  Rio Negro , Chubut and Neuquen after damage
to livestock and crops.  To contact the reporter on this story:
