Syngenta AG (SYNN) , the world’s largest
producer of crop chemicals, is threatened by an increasingly
competitive market with Chinese manufacturers of pesticides
looking to export more, Morgan Stanley said.  Chinese export volumes of crop-care chemicals are
accelerating and Syngenta’s traditional competitors in the west
are also focusing more on price as the pace of new product
introductions and ingredient development declines, Morgan
Stanley analysts including Amy Walker said in a note.  “We continue to believe the market is ignoring key risks
in the Syngenta investment story,” Walker said. “Syngenta’s
performance  and valuation  suggest the market expects further
strong acceleration in top-line and profit growth. We see
downside risk to the market’s bullish expectations.”  Syngenta’s market valuation could shrink by 38 percent in
the worst-case scenario, where growth stagnates and generic
competition hurts margins. While Syngenta will benefit from its
integrated approach, spanning seeds and herbicides for each
crop, the heightened competitive environment and limits on the
returns from research will hamper its growth, the analysts said.  The bank set a price target for Syngenta shares of 445
francs in the best case scenario, falling to 205 francs in the
worst case. Stock of Basel, Switzerland-based Syngenta fell 2
percent to 325.7 francs in Zurich today as of 12:20 p.m.,
valuing the company at 30.3 billion francs ($31.6 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
