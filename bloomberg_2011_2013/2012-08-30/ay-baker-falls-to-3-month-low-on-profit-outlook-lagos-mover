May & Baker of Nigeria Plc , the
nation’s second-biggest maker of pharmaceuticals by market
value, fell to the lowest in three months on speculation its
profit may decline further.  The stock fell for a fourth day, losing 5 percent, the
daily limit, to 1.33 naira at the close in Lagos, the commercial
capital. That’s the lowest price since May 30.  “There is divestment following a disappointing half year
result,” David Adonri, chief executive officer of Lagos-based
Lambeth Trust and Investment Co., said by phone today.
“Investors are afraid income could further decline.”  Profit for the six months through June fell to 27.5 million
naira ($174,395) from 83.1 million naira a year earlier, the
Lagos-based company said on Aug. 13. Revenue rose to 2.4 billion
naira from 2.3 billion naira.  May & Baker’s shares have declined 33 percent this year,
compared with a 14 percent gain in the  Nigerian Stock Exchange
All-Share Index (NGSEINDX)  over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
