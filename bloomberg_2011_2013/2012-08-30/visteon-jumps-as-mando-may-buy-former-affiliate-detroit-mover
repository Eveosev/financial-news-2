Visteon Corp. (VC)  rose to the highest
level in more than three months after  Mando Corp. (060980)  said it may
bid for Visteon’s 70 percent stake in  Halla Climate Control
Corp. (018880) , Mando’s former affiliate.  Visteon  rose  8.3 percent to $45.99 at 10:38 a.m. in New
York, after earlier reaching $46.46, the highest intraday price
since May 7. The shares had fallen 15 percent this year through
yesterday amid Visteon’s faltering efforts to shed lower-margin
units and focus on faster-growing operations focused on Asia.  Visteon, the U.S. auto-parts maker spun off from  Ford Motor
Co. (F)  in 2000, has surged 31 percent this month on speculation it
may attract a bid for Halla Climate shares or an outright
takeover offer. Mando hired an adviser, though no decision has
been made on an offer, South Korea’s second-largest maker of
auto parts said in a regulatory filing today.  Halla Climate shares rose 2.7 percent to 24,500 won
($21.60) at the close in Seoul trading, increasing the company’s
market value to 2.6 trillion won. Mando gained 0.3 percent.  Jim Fisher , a spokesman for Van Buren Township, Michigan-
based Visteon, declined to comment.  Visteon in July failed in an attempt to buy the remaining
30 percent of Halla Climate, which makes automotive air
conditioners. South Korea’s National Pension Service, which  owns 
8.1 percent of Halla, rejected the U.S. company’s offer and
reached a preliminary agreement to give Mando the preferred
bidder status for the fund’s stake.  CEO Resignation  Visteon in July also ended an agreement to sell the
majority of its interiors business to its joint venture with
 Huayu Automotive Systems Co. (600741)   Visteon’s Chief Executive Officer Don Stebbins resigned on
Aug. 10 and the company’s board installed Tim Leuliette as
interim chairman, president and CEO.  Ryan Brinkman, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase & Co. in  New
York , raised his price target on Visteon to $50 from $35. He
valued Visteon on a sum-of-its-parts basis at $56 a share.  “Visteon’s new management is incrementally motivated to
better realize the value of the sum of the firm’s various parts
over a shorter duration,” Brinkman wrote in a research note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
