Ukraine’s grain exports in the
marketing year that started July 1 may exceed 20 million metric
tons, agriculture researcher UkrAgroConsult said, citing the
 Agriculture Ministry .  The government estimates 4 million tons of wheat, 3 million
tons of barley and 12.4 million tons of corn can be exported as
the shipments won’t disrupt domestic grain supplies,
UkrAgroConsult said in an e-mailed statement today. The
researcher said it was citing a draft version of a memorandum
between the Agriculture Ministry and the industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
