Nord Gold NV (NORD) , Russian billionaire
 Alexey Mordashov â€™s producer of the metal, swung to a loss in the
second quarter as financing and production costs increased.  The net loss was $3.4 million after a $26 million profit a
year before, Nord Gold said today in a report on its  website .
Sales slid 12 percent to $264.7 million as production fell.  Nord Gold cut output 17 percent to 165,300 troy ounces, it
said. Costs per ounce grew 20 percent to $863, led by West
African projects. Finance costs more than doubled to $42 million
as interest was repaid to OAO Severstal. Nord Gold reiterated a
lower full-year output target of 720,000 to 770,000 ounces.  The company may cut its medium-term production targets in
the second half, hurting 2013 earnings, Nikolay Sosnovsky, an
analyst at VTB Capital, wrote yesterday in a note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
