Cocoa futures extended a rally to a
nine-month high on mounting concern that supplies may be
disrupted in  Ivory Coast , the world’s top producer. Cotton and
orange juice also gained, while coffee and sugar fell.  At least 14 people have been killed in six gun attacks on
the army and police this month, prompting soldiers to step up
security across the Ivory Coast. Futures headed for the third
straight monthly gain, the longest rally since early 2011.  “Near-term tight supplies and the outbreak of violence in
Ivory Coast are the main factors” supporting prices, John
Caruso, a senior broker at R.J. O’Brien in  Chicago , said in a
telephone interview. The price “could reach $2,750 in this
run,” he said.  Cocoa for December delivery rose 1 percent to settle at
$2,601 a metric ton at 12:12 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . Earlier, the commodity reached $2,620, the highest for a
most-active contract since Nov. 9.  In March last year, cocoa reached a 32-year high after a
disputed presidential election in November 2010 led to a civil
war. President  Alassane Ouattara  ordered a four-month ban on
cocoa exports to cut off funds to his rival who lost the vote
and refused to cede power.  Cotton futures for December delivery increased 0.4 percent
to 76.94 cents a pound in New York.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery advanced 1.3
percent to $1.172 a pound.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery fell 2 percent
to $1.634 a pound.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery decreased less than
0.1 percent to 19.75 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
