Japanese  shares  fell, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average falling to a two-week low, after U.S.
economic growth damped speculation Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  may announce a third round of quantitative easing.
Stocks also fell as  Japan ’s retail sales sank more than expected.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , a carmaker that gets almost a third of
its sales from North America, slid 1.2 percent even after its
price target was raised by Credit Suisse Group AG. Electronics
retailer Yamada Denki Co. lost 4.1 percent. Furukawa Electric Co.
gained the most in the Nikkei 225 after its aluminum unit agreed
to take over Sumitomo Light Metal Industries Ltd.  The Nikkei 225 slid 1 percent to 8,983.78 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo , the lowest since Aug. 15. Volume was 15 percent
below the 30-day average ahead of the Fed chairman’s speech
tomorrow at a central bankers’ conference in  Wyoming . The
broader  Topix (TPX)  Index lost 0.8 percent to 743.79, with more than
three shares dropping for each that gained.  “Investors are concerned that strong economic data out of
the U.S. may delay QE3,” said Yoshihisa Okamoto, who helps
oversee about $34 billion at Mizuho Asset Management Co.
Investors aren’t buying shares “because even though the U.S.
economic data was good, they won’t have a full picture until
Bernanke’s speech.”  The Topix rebounded 6.9 percent from this year’s low on
June 4 amid speculation global central banks will act to
stimulate economic growth. Stocks on the gauge are valued at 0.9
times book value, compared with 2.2 for the S&P 500 and 1.5 for
the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number less than one means
companies can be bought for less than the value of their assets.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.3 percent
today. The gauge gained 0.1 percent yesterday on a report gross
domestic product expanded at an annualized 1.7 percent rate from
April through June, beating an initial estimate of 1.5 percent.  Gradual Expansion  The  U.S. economy  continued to expand “gradually” in July
and early August as improving housing and retail sales helped
outweigh a weakness in manufacturing, the Fed said in its Beige
Book business survey based on reports from its 12 districts. The
report reflects information collected on or before Aug. 20.  “Investors who expect Bernanke to deliver a clear
commitment to QE3 might be disappointed, which could trigger
some sort of sell-off,” said Mikio Kumada, a Singapore-based
global strategist for LGT Capital Management, which oversees
more than $20 billion. “This is still not a time to bet against
major central banks’ ability to intervene in markets.”  Nissan, which relies on North America as its biggest market,
slid 1.2 percent to 741 yen even after Credit Suisse Group
boosted the stock price estimate to 970 yen to 760 yen, saying
Nissan is undervalued because new model launches will boost
global market share. Toyo Tire & Rubber Co., which gets a third
of its revenue from  North America , slid 2.3 percent to 215 yen.  Japanese retailers fell after the nation’s retail sales
fell more than estimated in July as the government phases out
subsidies for car purchases, damping  consumer spending . The 0.8
percent fall from a year earlier was the first drop in eight
months and compared with the median estimate of a 0.1 percent
fall, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 13 economists.  Retailers Drop  Yamada Denki sank 4.1 percent to 3,840 yen. Department-
store operator Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings Ltd. slipped 1.5
percent to 832 yen.  Furukawa Electric, a cable maker that owns 53 percent of
Furukawa-Sky Aluminum Corp., jumped 4.6 percent to 161 yen, the
most on the Nikkei 225, after the aluminum unit agreed to take
over Sumitomo Light Metal Industries Ltd. Furukawa-Sky, Japan’s
top maker of rolled aluminum products, rose 2.9 percent to 214
yen, while Sumitomo Light Metal tumbled 5.2 percent to 73 yen.  -- With assistance from Adam Haigh in Sydney. Editor:  Jim Powell ,
