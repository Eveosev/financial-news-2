Smart Metering Systems Plc will
supply gas meters and smart-metering solutions to the U.K. arm
of Danish state-owned oil and gas company Dong Energy AS.  The company will replace gas meters for Dong Energy Sales
Ltd.’s industrial and commercial customers, enabling functions
such as remote reading and sending of half-hourly usage data, it
said in an e-mailed statement, without valuing the contract.  The Glasgow, Scotland-based company owns, connects and
operates meters for energy companies with access to 80 percent
of the U.K.’s industrial and commercial gas market.  It agreed on a 45 million-pound ($71 million)  bank loan  to
fund growth into the gas-meter market, the company said this
month. The U.K. government expects 53 million smart meters to be
installed in homes and businesses across the country by 2019.  To contact the reporter on this story:
