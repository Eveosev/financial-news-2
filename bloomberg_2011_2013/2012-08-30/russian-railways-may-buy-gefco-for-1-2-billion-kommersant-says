OAO Russian Railways is studying the
acquisition of  France ’s GEFCO, a logistics operator controlled
by PSA Peugeot Citroen,  Kommersant  reported, citing unidentified
people familiar with the matter.  The Russian state company is ready to pay as much as 1
billion euros ($1.25 billion) for 75 percent of GEFCO which
Peugeot Citroen is selling as a “non-core asset,” the
newspaper said. The plan will be discussed at Russian Railways
board of directors’ meeting in early September, according to
Kommersant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
