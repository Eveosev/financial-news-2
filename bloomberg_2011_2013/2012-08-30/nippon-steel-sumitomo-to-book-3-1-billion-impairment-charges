Nippon Steel Corp. (5401)  and  Sumitomo
Metal Industries Ltd. (5405) , which will merge in October to become the
world’s second largest steelmaker, widened first-year loss
estimates on a combined 240 billion yen ($3.1 billion) in
impairment charges.  Nippon Steel, Japan’s biggest mill, faces a 155 billion yen
loss in the six months ending Sept. 30 due to a 120 billion yen
impairment charge at its unprofitable plants in Hirohata and
Sakai in western Japan, the Tokyo-based company said today in a
statement. Sumitomo Metal, Japan’s third largest maker of steel,
widened its loss estimate to 128 billion yen from 8 billion yen
on charges for its Wakayama mill.  The two companies left their current profit forecasts
unchanged at 10 billion yen each and will give a full-year
earnings outlook after the combination is completed on Oct. 1,
according to the statement.  Japanese steelmakers, facing falling prices and intense
competition, are paring costs and streamlining to challenge
rivals in China and  South Korea . The combined company will
maintain operations at the Hirohata, Sakai and Wakayama
steelworks.  Nippon Steel closed down 3.6 percent to 160 yen today on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Sumitomo Metal  fell 3.3 percent to 117
yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
