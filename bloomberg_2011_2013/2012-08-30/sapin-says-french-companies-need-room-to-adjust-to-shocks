French Labor Minister Michel Sapin
said he wants to revamp regulation to help companies cope with
economic shocks.  France  needs rules that “allow companies to adapt,” Sapin
told Bloomberg Television today in Jouy-en-Josas, near Paris.
It’s about the “ability of companies to adapt to a changing
world, changing technology and economic shocks.”  The remarks suggest that President  Francois Hollande ’s
government is looking for ways to make France’s workforce more
flexible in order to revive the  economy  following three straight
quarters without growth. Sapin, who said he’s discussing that
adaptability with companies, gave the interview at a meeting of
business leaders organized by MEDEF, the main business lobby.  The government is also aiming to implement any tax
increases needed to balance the budget in 2013 so that the
burden is shared between consumers and businesses without
driving investment abroad.  “It needs to be done intelligently,” Sapin said, echoing
comments made by Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici . Asked in an
interview with the Les Echos newspaper about the government’s
plans to tax earnings above 1 million euros ($1.3 million) at a
rate of 75 percent, Moscovici said the levy needs to be designed
carefully.  “This tax needs to be intelligent,” he said. “We don’t
want to create an exodus of executives.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
