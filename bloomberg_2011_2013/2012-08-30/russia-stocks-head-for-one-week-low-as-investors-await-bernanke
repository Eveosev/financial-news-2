Russian stocks fell to the lowest in
more than a week as investors sold riskier assets on concern
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke  will not signal additional
stimulus measures during his speech tomorrow. OAO Sberbank and
VTB Group slumped.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  declined 0.5 percent to 1,429.82 by the
close in Moscow, the lowest close since Aug. 20. OAO Mosenergo,
the Moscow-based power generator controlled by OAO Gazprom,
slipped 2.3 percent, while steelmaker OAO Magnitogorsk Iron &
Steel retreated 1.8 percent. OAO Magnit,  Russia ’s biggest food
retailer, rose 1.1 percent.  U.S. gross domestic product climbed at a 1.7 percent annual
rate from April through June, up from an initial estimate of 1.5
percent, data showed yesterday. Separate data showed Americans
signed more contracts to purchase previously owned homes in
July. Emerging-market stocks fell after improved data dimmed
prospects of Bernanke announcing additional stimulus measures in
his address at a symposium in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming .  “Investors are waiting for Friday, there’s a general
consensus that Bernanke won’t do anything,” Dmitry Malykhin,
who oversees $30 million in Russian assets as a chief  investment
adviser  at Moscow-based hedge fund Da Vinci CIS Opportunities,
said by phone today. “If Bernanke doesn’t hint at stimulus,
we’ll see a strong decline.”  The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  retreated 1.8 percent to
1,384.26, falling for the fifth day.  Crude oil, Russia’s chief export earner, declined 1.3
percent to $94.25 in  New York . Oil and gas contribute about 50
percent to Russia’s state revenue.  Brent crude  rose 0.2 percent
to $112.71.  Draghi’s Speech  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  canceled his
trip to Jackson Hole to shepherd the ECB’s negotiations over
peripheral bond purchases.  “The fact that Draghi isn’t coming made many investors
think there won’t be any new stimulus measures,” Malykhin said.  Polyus Gold International Plc rose 0.8 percent to 975.10
rubles, the biggest gain in two weeks. The London-listed gold
producer with its main operations in Russia said it seeks to
further increase the metal recovery rate at its flagship
Olimpiada mine to boost profit.  The company’s gold sales surged 36 percent to $1.22 billion
in the first half, the company said today.  Evraz Plc (EVR)  declined 2.1 percent to 226.50 pence in  London .
First-half net income dropped 81 percent from a year earlier,
Russia’s largest steelmaker said today.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index tumbled 0.4 percent to 666.08,
headed for a two-week low.  Sberbank Retreats  Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, retreated 1.1 percent to
93.49 rubles as the ruble depreciated for the third day. The
lender’s first-half net income fell 0.5 percent to 175.3 billion
rubles ($5.5 billion) from 176.1 billion rubles a year earlier,
the Moscow-based lender said on its website yesterday.  Sberbank has the  third-largest  weighting in the index. VTB,
Russia’s second-largest lender, dropped 2.3 percent to 5.31
kopeks.  M.Video jumped 4.4 percent to 283.23 rubles, the highest
level since February 2011. The Russian electronics retailer
plans to pay a record first-half dividend of 30 rubles a share,
the company’s Chief Financial Officer Christopher Parks said
during a conference call yesterday.  The Micex trades at 5.3 times  estimated earnings  and has
rallied 2 percent this year. That compares with a multiple of
9.8 times and a 3.1 percent advance for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index.  Russian equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21 emerging markets tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
