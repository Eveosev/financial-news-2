Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) , the Persian
Gulf country’s biggest bank by assets, raised its stake in Dubai
based- Commercial Bank International PSC (CBI)  to 39.9 percent from
16.5 percent in a deal that may be worth about $75 million.  The purchase “reflects the confidence in the prospects of
the financial sector in the  United Arab Emirates ,” Qatar
National said in an e-mailed statement. The 22.5 percent stake
is equivalent to 329 million shares, according to Bloomberg
calculations, and would be worth $75 million based on today’s 84
fils share price.  The U.A.E., a union of seven emirates including  Abu Dhabi 
and Dubai, has the biggest banking market in the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council, which also includes  Saudi Arabia  and Qatar.
 Commercial Bank of Qatar QSC , the country’s second-biggest
lender, also bought a 40 percent stake in U.A.E.’s United Arab
Bank PSC during 2007 and 2008 to expand in the country.  Qatar National Bank is expanding in foreign markets amid
limited domestic growth prospects. Recent acquisitions include a
51 percent stake in Iraq’s Mansour Bank and taking 49 percent of
Libya’s closely-held Bank of Commerce & Development. The bank is
now present in 24 countries, it said today in the statement.  Commercial Bank International had assets of 12 billion
dirhams at the end of June, according to Bloomberg data. It
reported a profit of 75.2 million dirhams in the second quarter
and had net revenues of 167.7 million dirhams.  Qatar National Bank rose 0.5 percent today to 134.1 riyals
in Doha today, valuing the bank at 93.8 billion riyals. Its
shares have fallen 3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
