FHB Jelzalogbank Nyrt. (FHB) , a Hungarian
mortgage lender, gained the most in more than a week after  Napi
Gazdasag  reported the bank expects a surge in new loans.  The shares rose 1.1 percent to 479 forint by the end of
trading in Budapest, the most since Aug. 22. The benchmark BUX
stock  index  dropped 0.2 percent.  FHB’s new lending may rise by “at least 50 percent
according to the most pessimistic scenario” thanks to a
subsidised interest rate program, Chief Executive Officer Laszlo Harmati told the newspaper in an interview published today.  Hungarian household mortgage rates are set to drop and
demand for credit will probably rise as a result of state
interest-rate subsidies on housing loans, the central bank said
in a quarterly lending survey published yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
