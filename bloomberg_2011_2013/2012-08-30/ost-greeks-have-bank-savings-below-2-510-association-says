Most Greeks hold deposits of less
than 2,000 euros ($2,510) in the nation’s banks, according to
the latest data from the Hellenic Bank Association.  As of June 30, some 82 percent had deposits of as much as
2,000 euros and another 11 percent had deposits between 2,000
euros and 10,000 euros, according to  a statement  posted on the
Athens-based organization’s website. The data showed that 5.9
percent had deposits of between 10,000 euros and 50,000 euros,
0.9 percent of between 50,000 euros and 100,000 euros and the
smallest percentage, 0.4 percent, with more than 100,000 euros.  Greek banks have seen deposits dwindle more than a third
since Dec. 2009, when concern about the country defaulting on
its debt drove the government to seek an international rescue.
Concerns the country would be forced out of the common euro area
currency for failing to comply with the terms of the rescue has
kept up pressure on deposits.  The balance of savings held by households and businesses
rose in July for the first time since April, as two elections in
six weeks sparked concern the country would abandon the euro. In
May alone, 8.6 billion euros was withdrawn from the nation’s
banks, according to Bank of Greece figures, in the wake of the
first inconclusive election which gave gains to Syriza, a party
which promised to defy the terms of the bailouts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
