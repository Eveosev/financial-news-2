Cash bonuses for European bankers
should not exceed their fixed pay, German Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  wrote in the Financial Times.  He also urged that shareholders should have the final say
on bank executives’ long-term pay awards if they exceed a given
level.  “A truly effective European banking supervisor” is needed
to oversee the sector, enforcing “a robust single rule book,”
Schaeuble wrote.  The supervisor, who Schaeuble said is expected to be housed
at the  European Central Bank , should focus on those banks that
can pose a systemic risk at a Europe-wide level, he wrote.  The new oversight system must not be “just a facade,” he
wrote, adding that the new supervisor must be endowed with
“real and clearly defined responsibilities, coercive powers and
adequate resources.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
