percent to 1,590.20.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold declined for the third straight day as investors
weighed whether the  Federal Reserve  will signal a new round of

delay a decision on seeking aid.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will speak tomorrow at an
annual meeting in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , where in 2010 he
