Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) , the second-
largest U.S. video-game publisher, obtained a $500 million
revolving line of credit.  The unsecured debt, which comes due Feb. 29, 2016, may be
increased by as much as $250 million, the company said today in
a regulatory filing. The financing is arranged by JPMorgan Chase
& Co, BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley,
according to the filing.  Proceeds of the loan for the  Redwood City , California-based
company will support corporate purposes. The maker of “Madden
NFL” and “Medal of Honor” has become the largest publisher of
games that are free to play on mobile devices, according to
Frank Gibeau, president of the company’s EA Labels.  In a revolving line of credit, money may be borrowed again
once it is repaid.  Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI)  is the largest U.S.
publisher of video games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
