New Zealand ’s economy is feeling the
effects of “unorthodox” policies such as quantitative easing
carried out in other developed nations, central bank Governor
Alan Bollard said today.  “These are very large injections and they are clearly
having an effect on capital flows and exchange rates in other
countries, and we know something about that in New Zealand,”
Bollard said in comments at a seminar in Wellington.  The  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand has kept its official cash
rate at a record-low 2.5 percent since March last year as the
economy recovers slowly during  Europe ’s debt crisis and amid
weaker global demand for the country’s exports. Since the last
rate reduction on March 10, 2011, the currency has risen 9
percent.  After a decade at the helm of the RBNZ, Bollard will be
replaced by former World Bank official Graeme Wheeler near the
end of next month. Traders are pricing in a 1 percent chance of
higher rates before March and a 54 percent chance of a rate cut,
according to  interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg.  New Zealand’s dollar has climbed 3.2 percent this year,
making it the best performer among the Group of 10 currencies
after Sweden’s krona.  To contact the reporter on this story:
