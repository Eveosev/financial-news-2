Players will counteroffer National
Hockey League negotiators by the end of the week as the sides
seek to reach agreement on a new labor contract before the
existing one expires Sept. 15.  Points including the revenue-sharing structure are at the
center of the debate between the league and the players’ union,
which is mulling a league proposition received two days ago.  Under the current collective bargaining agreement, the
players get 57 percent of the hockey-related revenue, while the
latest league proposal calls for 46 percent.  NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman noted that players in the
 National Football League  and  National Basketball Association 
both took a smaller share of revenue after lockouts.  “Reducing the share isn’t something extraordinary, it has
become a matter of fact,” Bettman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
