Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  and LivingSocial Inc.
were sued by a patent owner that claimed the discount online
marketers are infringing protected technology for mobile-phone
advertising.  XcellaSave Inc. is seeking a  jury trial  and unspecified
damages from Chicago-based Groupon and Washington-based
LivingSocial, according to two lawsuits filed yesterday in
federal court in Delaware.  The companies continue “to create and disseminate
promotional and marketing materials” and technical information
in infringing applications that run on the iPhone and BlackBerry
as well as phones that run on Android- and Windows-based
operating systems, Middle Village, New York-based XcellaSave
alleges in court papers.  A Groupon spokeswoman, Julie Mossler, declined to comment
on the lawsuit. LivingSocial spokeswoman Maire Griffin didn’t
immediately return an e-mail message seeking comment on the
lawsuit.  Barclays Plc cut its rating on Groupon shares on Aug. 21,
citing the potential for increased marketing costs and narrowing
profit margins. Groupon fell 2.8 percent to $4.19 today in
Nasdaq Stock Market  trading .  The cases are XcellaSave v. Groupon, 12-cv-1085; and
XcellaSave v. LivingSocial, 12-cv-1086, U.S. District Court,
District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To see the patent in the lawsuit, click: 8,254,894.  To contact the reporters on this story:
