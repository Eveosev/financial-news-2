M.Video, a Russian electronics
retailer, plans to pay a record first-half dividend,  Vedomosti 
reported, citing remarks by Chief Financial Officer Christopher
Parks during a conference call yesterday.  The company’s board will recommend that shareholders
approve a payout of as much as 30 rubles per share, or a total
of 5.39 billion rubles ($167 million), the newspaper said.
M.Video has enough cash to open more stores and doesn’t see
attractive acquisition opportunities, according to Vedomosti.  To contact the reporter on this story:
