Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas
Co., a Qatari LNG producer, said a virus has shut down part of
its computer system since Aug. 27.  Desktop computers in company offices were affected by the
bug, while operational systems at onshore and offshore
installations are secure, a company official said today by phone
from Doha. The virus hasn’t affected production or cargoes, said
the official, who declined to be named citing company policy.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co, the world’s biggest crude exporter,
said on Aug. 26 that most of its computer network was back to
normal after a virus forced the company to isolate parts of its
system.  Officials at  Qatar Liquefied Gas Co. , the country’s biggest
LNG producer, and Qatar International Petroleum Marketing Co.
didn’t immediately respond to e-mails or phone calls for comment
on whether its computer systems had been affected by viruses.  Qatar Petroleum , the state-owned energy company, wasn’t
affected by any viruses, according to an official, who declined
to be named citing company policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
