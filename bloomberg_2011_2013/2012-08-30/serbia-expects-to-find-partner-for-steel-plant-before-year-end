Serbia will probably find a partner
by the year end for  Zelezara Smederevo d.o.o. , the country’s
sole steel mill, Finance and Economy Minister  Mladjan Dinkic 
told reporters in Belgrade today.  Serbia is not satisfied with the companies that showed
interest in Zelezara Smederevo in a sales tender which expires
next month, he said.  “None of those that registered to take part in the tender
is a serious company, but we are getting calls from much more
serious strategic partners,” Dinkic said. “I expect that we’ll
find a partner for the steelworks by the end of the year,”
possibly through direct negotiations.  Serbia bought back Zelezara from  U.S. Steel Corp. (X)  earlier
this year for a token amount as international investors gave up
on the unprofitable plant. The government has halted both
furnaces at Zelezara to reduce losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
