China Railway Construction Corp. (1186)  and
 China Railway Group Ltd. (390) , the world’s second- and third-largest
listed builders, reported declines in first-half profit as the
government pared spending on new lines following a crash.  CRCC’s net income dropped 12 percent to 3.2 billion  yuan 
($504 billion) under domestic accounting standards, according to
a Shanghai stock exchange filing late yesterday.  China  Railway
Group’s  profit  fell 2.2 percent to 2.39 billion yuan, under
international standards.  Sales fell more than 10 percent at both of the Beijing-
based builders as the government cut first-half spending on new
railways by 39 percent following a fatal high-speed train crash
last year. Rival China Communications Construction Co. also said
yesterday it will increase its focus on overseas lines because
they are more profitable than the domestic market.  CRCC said it will “actively seize” new opportunities to
pare its reliance on building railways. China Railway Group has
won a contract to build a bridge linking Hong Kong, Zhuhai and
Macau as it also looks for new work.  CSR Corp. (1766) , China’s biggest trainmaker by market value, also
reported a 6 percent decline in first-half profit because of a
slowdown in domestic demand and higher research costs. The
Ministry of Railways in July raised spending plans for railroads
and bridges this year by 14 percent to 470 billion yuan, as the
government boosts investment to spur economic growth.  China Railway Group won 290 billion yuan of contracts in 
the first half, up 22 percent from a year earlier. It had
expected to book 650 billion yuan of orders this year. First-
half infrastructure-construction sales dropped 15 percent to
164 billion yuan.  CCRC’s contract wins rose 37 percent from a year earlier
to 280 billion yuan. The tally for domestic rail projects
dropped 9.4 percent to 18.4 billion yuan. Sales fell 13 percent
to 184.5 billion yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
