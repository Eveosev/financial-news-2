BT Group Plc (BT/A)  raised 13.9 billion
rupees ($251 million) by selling part of its stake in Indian
software developer  Tech Mahindra Ltd. (TECHM)  to institutional investors
and may consider offloading more.  The U.K’s largest fixed-line phone company sold a 14.1
percent stake, or 17.9 million shares, in Tech Mahindra at an
average price of 777.73 rupees per share, BT said in a statement
today. Tech Mahindra shares fell 5 percent to 793.05 rupees at
the close in Mumbai. BT was little changed at 219 pence as of
2:30 p.m. in  London .  BT, which said that Tech Mahindra will remain a key
supplier to the company, now holds 9.1 percent of the software
company. BT sold a 5.5 percent stake in Tech Mahindra to
automobile maker  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM)  in December 2010 for
4.5 billion rupees. The financial impact of the sale announced
today will be disclosed at the BT’s next financial results.  Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are
managing the sale, a person with knowledge of the matter has
said. The person declined to be identified because the
information wasn’t public.  Indian companies have raised 349 billion rupees from share
sales this year, a majority of which came from block trades to
institutions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
