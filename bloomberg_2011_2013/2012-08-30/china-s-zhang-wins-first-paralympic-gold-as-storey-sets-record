China ’s Zhang Cuiping set a record
while winning the first gold medal of the London  Paralympic
Games  in the women’s R2-10 meter air rifle standing SH1 event.  Zhang, 24, scored a final world record total of 500.9 to
defeat Germany’s Manuela Schmermund and Australia’s Natalie
Smith. The SH1 class of athletes can support the weight of their
firearm themselves and shoot using a rifle or pistol.  Britain’s Sarah Storey, a five-time Paralympic swimming
gold medalist, set a world record in qualifying for the women’s
individual C5 pursuit track cycling event.  The 33-year-old covered the three kilometers (1.9 miles) in
3 minutes and 32.17 seconds at the Velodrome in the Olympic
Park. Anna Harkowska of  Poland  was second in 3:48.885, and the
pair will race today for the gold medal.  Athletes classified between C1 and C5 have an impairment
that affects their legs, arms and/or trunk but can compete using
a standard bicycle.  Queen Elizabeth II  opened the Paralympics last night, and
28 gold medals in five sports will be awarded today. The games
will run through Sept. 9, with more than 4,000 athletes from 164
teams competing.   Jonathan Fox of Britain set another world record in the
men’s 100-meter backstroke S7 qualifying, finishing in 1 minute,
9.86 seconds. The swimming event’s final takes place in the
Aquatics Centre later today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
