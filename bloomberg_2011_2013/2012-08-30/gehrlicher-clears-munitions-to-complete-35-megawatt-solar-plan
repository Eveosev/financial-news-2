Gehrlicher Solar AG, a German
renewable park developer, completed a 35-megawatt solar plant in
Brandenburg after clearing a former military airbase of
munitions.  Gehrlicher installed 144,144  Yingli Green Energy Holding
Co. (YGE)  solar panels and 39  SMA Solar Technology AG (S92)  inverters at the
disused Perleberg base between Hamburg and Berlin, the Neustadt-
based developer said today in an e-mailed statement. That
followed the “complex undertaking of munitions-removal.”  The solar park was connected to the grid on Aug. 23 and is
projected to generate 33 million kilowatt-hours of electricity a
year, enough for 9,300 three-person households, Gehrlicher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
