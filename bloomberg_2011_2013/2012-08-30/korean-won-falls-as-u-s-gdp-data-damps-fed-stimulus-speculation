South Korea’s won fell toward a one-
month low as data showing the  U.S. economy  grew more than
estimated in the second quarter cooled speculation the Federal
Reserve will ease monetary policy further.  Gross domestic product in the world’s biggest economy
climbed at a 1.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter, up
from an initial estimate of 1.5 percent, according to figures
released yesterday. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
delivers a speech tomorrow in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming which may
shed light on the likelihood of additional stimulus. South
Korea’s government bonds gained as a central bank report showed
manufacturers’ confidence held near the lowest level since 2009.  “There’s lot of caution in the market ahead of Bernanke’s
speech,” said Yun Se Min, a Seoul-based currency trader for
Busan Bank. “South Korea’s exporters selling the dollar near
the end of the month limited the won’s losses.”  The won closed at 1,134.05 per dollar at the close in
 Seoul , from 1,133.47 yesterday, contributing to a 0.3 percent
decline for the month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 1,138.08 on Aug. 28, the weakest level since July 30,
and gained 1.6 percent this year.  One-month implied volatility for the won, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, slid three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.60 percent.  The  Federal Reserve  said in its beige book yesterday that
the U.S economy expanded gradually in July and early August. The
 Kospi Index (KOSPI)  slid 1.2 percent as overseas funds sold more of the
nation’s equities than they bought for a third day.  South Korea’s  exports  probably shrank 6.8 percent in August
from a year earlier, contracting for a second month, while
industrial output fell 0.9 percent in July from June, separate
Bloomberg News surveys showed before data due in the next two
days.  The yield on the government’s 3.5 percent bonds due March
2017 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to a three-
week low of 2.87 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.
Three-year debt futures climbed 0.05 to 106.25 and the one-year
interest-rate swap slid one basis point to 2.87 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
