Swap contracts declined for lower-
quality thermal coal from  Indonesia , the world’s biggest
exporter of the power-station fuel, according to Ginga Petroleum
Singapore Pte.  The swap for sub-bituminous coal with a calorific value of
4,900 kilocalories a kilogram for loading from Indonesia in the
fourth quarter dropped 55 cents to $63.20 a metric ton on a net-
as-received basis yesterday, Ginga said in an e-mail today. The
September contract slid 20 cents to $61.55 a ton.  The contract for coal with a heating value of 5,500
kilocalories a kilogram for delivery to South  China  in September
declined 75 cents to $81.35 a ton on a net-as-received basis,
the energy broker said. The swap for the fourth-quarter also
fell 75 cents to $83.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period.  About 60 percent of Indonesia’s coal is classified as sub-
bituminous. Higher moisture levels and a lower carbon content
reduce the heating value compared with grades with a better
quality stock. Sub-bit coal has kilocalories of less than 6,100
per kilogram, according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
