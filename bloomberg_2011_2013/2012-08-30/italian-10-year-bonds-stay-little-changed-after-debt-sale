Italian 10-year bonds stayed little
changed and five-year notes pared a decline after the nation’s
borrowing costs fell at a debt sale.  Italy’s 10-year yield was little changed at 5.77 percent as
of 10:23 a.m. London time, after earlier rising as much as seven
basis points to 5.84 percent. The  five-year rate  was seven basis
points higher at 4.81 percent, after climbing as much as 14
basis points before the auction.  Italy sold 7.29 billion euros of five-year and 10-year
securities, compared with a 7.5 billion-euro maximum target. The
yield on the new 10-year bond was 5.82 percent, compared to a
rate of 5.96 percent at a similar auction on July 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
