 Lars Frisell  said there is “no way around” consolidating the
nation’s budget as it seeks to recover from its fiscal crisis.  “Any measures by the ECB that would help the confidence
crisis of course would be beneficial to Ireland, too,” Frisell,
who took up his position in June, having previously held a
similar role at the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority,
said at an event in Dublin today.  While exports are currently driving Irish economic growth,
“I think Ireland can quickly get out of this” crisis if
 consumer confidence  recovers, he said.  Ireland, home to the euro region’s biggest banking crisis
to date, returned to growth last year for the first time since
its real-estate market started to fall in 2007. The country’s
bond yields have fallen in the past year on optimism the economy
is stabilizing, facilitating the government return to bond
markets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
