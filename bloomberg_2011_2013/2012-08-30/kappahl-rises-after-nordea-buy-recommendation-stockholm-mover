KappAhl AB (KAHL) , Swedenâ€™s second-largest
publicly traded clothing retailer, rose the most in seven months
in Stockholm trading after an analyst at Nordea Bank AB
recommended buying the stock.  KappAhl jumped as much as 13 percent to 6.35 kronor, the
biggest intraday gain since Jan. 31, and was trading up 8.9
percent at 11:38 a.m. The gain was the biggest on the  OMX
Stockholm All Share Index (SAX) , which fell 0.6 percent.  Stefan Stjernholm, a Nordea equity analyst, raised his
recommendation on KappAhl to buy from sell, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. He increased the 12-month price estimate
for the Molndal, Sweden-based retailer to 7.50 kronor a share
from 4.50 kronor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
