European stocks  fell for a third day
as data from Japan to Germany added to evidence that global
growth is slowing while speculation cooled that Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will announce more stimulus.  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Fiat SpA (F)  led a selloff in carmakers as
Morgan Stanley said earnings in Europe are at risk.  WPP (WPP)  Plc
dropped 1.6 percent after the world’s largest advertising
company cut its sales-growth forecast.  Carrefour (CA)  SA and  Vivendi (VIV) 
SA climbed after earnings topped analyst estimates.  The benchmark  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  fell 0.8 percent to
264.97 at the close of trading, extending this week’s decline to
1.1 percent. The measure has still surged 13 percent from its
June 4 low amid speculation that central banks will do more to
bolster growth. The gauge has advanced 1.4 percent in August.  Bernanke “is probably not going to do anything this coming
Friday because the labor market has been a little bit firmer
than it was,”  Kevin Gardiner , head of investment strategy for
Europe, Middle East and Africa at  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s wealth-
management unit in London, said on Bloomberg Television. “The
Fed on balance will conclude that they don’t need to do anything
just yet.”  Reports today showed  retail sales  in Japan fell 0.9 percent
in July from a year earlier, more than economists forecast,
while confidence among manufacturers in South Korea stayed near
the lowest level since the global financial crisis. Data out of
Australia showed home-building approvals tumbled by the most in
almost a decade.  European Economy  In Europe, German unemployment increased for a fifth
straight month in August while  economic confidence  in the euro
area fell more than economists forecast to a three-year low.  The Fed said late yesterday in its Beige Book business
survey that the economy continued to expand “gradually,”
damping speculation Bernanke will announce a third round of bond
purchases.  Bernanke is due to deliver his annual speech on monetary
policy at the central bank’s symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming,
tomorrow. His address in 2010 preceded a second round of
quantitative easing to support growth.  National benchmark indexes retreated in every western
European market today, except Iceland. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell
0.4 percent, France’s CAC 40 lost 1 percent and Germany’s DAX
dropped 1.6 percent.  Daimler led a gauge of carmakers down 4.3 percent for the
biggest decline among 19  industry groups  in the Stoxx 600. The
German maker of luxury vehicles fell 5.5 percent to 39.06 euros,
Italy’s Fiat dropped 2.1 percent to 4.33 euros and  Renault SA (RNO) 
slid 3.6 percent to 36.74 euros in Paris trading.  Auto Demand  “The latest data indicates that EU demand has fallen to
levels more typical of the 1980s,”  Stuart Pearson , a Morgan
Stanley auto-industry analyst, wrote in a report to clients.
“Any further deterioration could trigger more downgrades to our
and consensus estimates.”  The brokerage cited July’s European Union seasonally
adjusted annualized selling rate of 11 million units in July,
the lowest level since January 2009.  WPP slid 1.6 percent to 818.5 pence after the advertising
company reduced its full-year revenue-growth forecast as clients
cut spending amid the European debt crisis. Sales excluding the
impact of acquisitions and currency fluctuations will grow
“close to 3.5 percent” this year versus an earlier forecast
for 4 percent, the company said.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and Rio Tinto Group fell 3.3 percent to
1,842 pence and 2.1 percent to 2,715.5 pence respectively as
iron ore sank to the lowest in almost three years in China.  Iron Ore  Benchmark iron ore at the Chinese port of Tianjin slipped
1.8 percent to $88.70 a metric ton today, according to the Steel
Index Ltd.  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  slid 2.5 percent to 901 pence and  Glencore
International Plc (GLEN)  dropped 3 percent to 357.45 pence as Qatar
Holding LLC, which has a 12 percent stake in Xstrata, said it
will not support a merger between the two companies.  Hays Plc (HAS)  tumbled 8.8 percent to 69.9 pence after the
recruiter reported a 7 percent decline in full-year net fees, or
payments from clients less the payroll costs of workers, for the
U.K. and Ireland. The company said several markets are “likely
to remain very challenging” in 2013.  Pernod-Ricard SA (RI)  declined 2.4 percent to 85.66 euros after
France’s largest distiller reported a 9 percent gain in so-
called organic operating profit in the year to June 30, missing
the median analyst estimate for a 9.6 percent increase.  The company named Daniele Ricard chairman and said it
intends for Alexandre Ricard to take on the role as well as the
post of chief executive officer at the end of January 2015.  Barclays Drops  Barclays Plc fell 1.5 percent to 183.5 pence after naming
Antony Jenkins as its chief executive officer. Britain’s second-
largest lender promoted the head of its consumer banking
business as it recovers from the Libor scandal that forced out
former CEO  Robert Diamond .  Barclays confirmed after the close of trading yesterday
that it is facing a criminal probe into fees it paid to Qatar’s
sovereign wealth fund in 2008 as the bank sought to raise money
to avoid a government bailout.  Carrefour rallied 6.7 percent to 16.81 euros after the
world’s second-largest retailer reported first-half profit that
beat analysts’ estimates. Recurring operating income declined to
769 million euros ($965 million) from 838 million euros. The
median of 10 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 705
million euros.  Vivendi, ING  Vivendi gained 3.3 percent to 15.61 euros after Europe’s
biggest media and telecommunications company reported second-
quarter net income, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, of
706 million euros. That also beat analyst estimates of 652
million-euros. The company also raised its full-year forecast
for the Activision Blizzard Inc. video-game unit.  ING Groep NV (INGA)  rallied 2.6 percent to 5.91 euros after Bank
of Nova Scotia agreed to buy the Dutch company’s Canadian unit
for C$3.13 billion ($3.16 billion). Canada’s third-largest
lender will spend C$1.9 billion after deducting excess capital
at ING Direct in the cash deal.  Eiffage SA (FGR)  surged 7.3 percent to 24.41 euros after France’s
third-largest builder reported an 11 percent gain in first half
operating income to 499 million euros as profitability at its
APRR toll-road operation climbed.  Gemalto NV (GTO)  advanced 5 percent to 62.41 euros after the
inventor of the smart chip used in bank and phone cards said it
will reach its 2013 profit target a year early. Earnings from
operations rose 56 percent to 115 million euros, beating the
average analyst estimate of 101.3 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
