Estonia’s parliament approved the
euro area’s permanent rescue fund as the Baltic nation’s drive
for closer integration with European institutions outweighed
concerns over supporting richer countries.  Lawmakers in the capital, Tallinn, voted 59 to 34 with one
abstention to ratify the European Stability Mechanism today. The
ESM will succeed the temporary European Financial Stability
Facility, or EFSF, which was used to provide emergency loans to
Ireland and  Portugal  and a second round of aid to  Greece .  Estonia’s  Supreme Court  in July ruled that the ESM’s
founding treaty is in line with the Baltic nation’s
constitution, overcoming an appeal by Justice Chancellor Indrek
Teder, a constitutional watchdog.  “I certainly won’t agree with those saying that after
today’s vote, Estonia will hemorrhage money,” Jaanus Tamkivi,
the parliamentary head of the senior ruling party, the Reform
Party, said before the vote. “Still, I also don’t agree with
those saying the guarantees we are providing now can’t ever
materialize. But we have to be optimists.”  Estonia, which joined the euro in January 2011, is the
poorest member of the 17-nation single-currency region. Its ESM
contribution would be 0.186 percent of the total, compared with
guarantees of 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion), or 0.27 percent,
to the EFSF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
