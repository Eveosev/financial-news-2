Mexico’s peso fell to its weakest
level in four weeks as economic reports from  Europe , Japan and
 South Korea  fueled concern the global economy is slowing,
curbing demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 13.3478 per dollar
at 4 p.m. in Mexico City, the lowest level since Aug. 2 on a
closing basis. The slump pared this year’s increase to 4.4
percent, still the biggest among the dollar’s 16 most-traded
counterparts.  A report today showed economic confidence in the euro area
fell to a three-year low in August, dropping more than
economists had forecast. Japan’s retail sales declined in July
more than expected, figures from the trade ministry in  Tokyo 
showed. In South Korea, confidence among manufacturers stayed
near the lowest level since 2009, a report showed.  “Global economic data continues to highlight a weak
backdrop for growth momentum,”  Nick Chamie , head of global
foreign-exchange strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto,
said in a telephone interview. “It’s coming to the fore in
terms of being a driver for global markets.”  The yield on Mexico’s peso-denominated bonds due in 2024
climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.52
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell
0.28 centavo to 139.87 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporters on this story:
