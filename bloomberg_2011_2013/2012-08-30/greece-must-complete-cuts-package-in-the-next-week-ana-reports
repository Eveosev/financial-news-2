Greece’s government must settle on
an 11.5 billion-euro ($14.4 billion) package of austerity
measures by Sept. 6, as the troika of inspectors representing
its international creditors will arrive in Athens Sept. 7,
state-run Athens News Agency reported, without citing anyone.  Officials representing the  European Central Bank , the
European Commission and the  International Monetary Fund  will
stay in Athens until Sept. 13 and then accompany Greek Finance
Minister Yannis Stournaras to a working group meeting of
European finance ministers in Nicosia, Cyprus, ANA said.  The government’s austerity package for 2013 and 2014 may
include cutting Christmas and Easter bonuses for pensioners,
abolishing seasonal  unemployment benefits  for as many as 160,000
employees, cutting wages in state-run companies and reducing
subsidies for local governments and state investment projects,
the news agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
