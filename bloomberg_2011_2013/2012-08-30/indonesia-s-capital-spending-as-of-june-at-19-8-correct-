(Corrects target timeframe in second paragraph.)  The Indonesian government’s  capital
spending  as of June amounted to 19.8 percent of the target for
2012.  Total spending in the first half was 32 percent of the
annual target, Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, chairman of the
President’s Delivery Unit for Development Monitoring and
Oversight, said in Jakarta today. The government had aimed to
spend 50 percent of the total by June, he said.  Capital spending is a key factor in reaching economic
growth targets,  Mangkusubroto said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
