German plant and machinery orders
declined for a ninth month in July as domestic demand slumped,
the VDMA machine-makers’ association said.  Orders, adjusted for inflation, fell 2 percent from a year
earlier after dropping an annual 1 percent in June, the
Frankfurt-based  VDMA  said in an e-mailed statement today.
Domestic orders fell 18 percent, while orders from abroad rose 8
percent. In the three months through July, orders rose 2 percent
from the same period last year.  Impulses for foreign orders “didn’t only come from
overseas but also from euro-member countries,”  Ralph Wiechers ,
VDMA’s chief economist, said in the statement. The decline of
domestic orders is partially due to a high level of orders last
year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
