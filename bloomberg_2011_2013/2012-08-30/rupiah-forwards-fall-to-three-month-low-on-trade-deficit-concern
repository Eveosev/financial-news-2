Indonesia’s rupiah reached the
weakest level in three months and  government bonds  declined on
speculation the nation’s trade deficit is widening.  Global funds sold $29.3 million more local stocks than they
bought yesterday and withdrew 820 billion rupiah ($86 million)
from debt holdings this week through yesterday, exchange and
finance ministry data show. Indonesia failed to reach its target
in a bond auction this week, after five sales that sold more
bonds than projected. The nation likely recorded a trade deficit
of  $1.5 billion  in July, compared with $1.3 billion the previous
month, according to a Bloomberg survey ahead of data due Sept. 3.  “The trade deficit continues to be a concern, and we
expect to see another next month,” said Billie Fuliangsahar,
the head of treasury at PT Rabobank International  Indonesia  in
Jakarta. “I don’t expect the rupiah to go past the 9,600 level
as the central bank will continue to support the currency.”  The rupiah, this year’s worst performer among  Asia ’s most-
traded currencies, dropped 5.6 percent in 2012 and is poised for
a seventh month of declines, weakening 1.4 percent in August,
prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. The currency
dropped 0.2 percent today to 9,573 per dollar as of 5:39 p.m. in
Jakarta and touched 9,590, the weakest level since May 31.  One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was steady at 7.25 percent. The
gauge fell 5.95 percentage points this year.  The yield on Indonesia’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
climbed seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 6.29
percent, the highest level since June 20, according to closing
prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association. The notes are
poised for the biggest monthly drop for 10-year government notes
since January 2011, pushing the yield up 58 basis points, or
0.58 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
