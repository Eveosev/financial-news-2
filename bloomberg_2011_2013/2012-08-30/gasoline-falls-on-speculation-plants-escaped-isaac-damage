Gasoline fell on speculation that
South Louisiana refineries escaped major damage from Hurricane
Isaac and downtime will be limited.  Futures declined as Isaac, which has weakened to a tropical
storm after making landfall on the Louisiana Gulf Coast Aug. 28
as a Category 1 hurricane, was forecast to weaken to a tropical
depression by later today as it moves into North Louisiana.
Isaac caused the shutdown of six refineries representing about
13 percent of Gulf Coast capacity.  “Gasoline is down for a third day as the storm hasn’t done
any major damage to refineries, though it’s still going to be a
challenge to get back to normal,” said  Phil Flynn , senior
market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “There’s also
some rollover pressure on the September contracts.”  September-delivery gasoline fell 1.77 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $3.0826 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . It was the first three-day decline since
July 25. The more actively traded October contract fell 0.88
cent to $2.908.  Valero Energy Corp., which shut its Louisiana refineries in
Meraux and Norco because of power outages and flooding risks,
said neither apparently had major damage to production units and
crews were able to get into the plants today for inspections.  “They’re taking the long journey back to restart those
refineries,” Flynn said.  Heating oil for September delivery rose 0.88 cent, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $3.1245 a gallon. October heating oil
advanced 1.09 cents to $3.1333.  Regular  gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 2.2
cents to $3.826 gallon yesterday, the highest level since April
26, AAA data showed. The average has climbed 50 cents, or 15
percent, since the year-to-date low of $3.326 on July 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
