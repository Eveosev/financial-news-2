Hawker Beechcraft Inc., the bankrupt
business-jet maker, is making “significant progress” in
completing an agreement for a sale to Superior Aviation Beijing
Co., a Hawker attorney said.  Hawker said in July that Superior agreed to acquire Hawker
for $1.79 billion, subject to higher bids at an auction.  “We continue to work around the clock with Superior,”
Patrick Nash, an attorney for Hawker, said at a hearing today in
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in  Manhattan . “We continue to make
significant progress on very complex business and legal
issues.”  Nash said Wichita, Kansas-based Hawker hopes to file within
a week the agreement with Superior and a revised bankruptcy
plan. The deal with Superior won’t include Hawker Beechcraft
Defense Co., Hawker has said.  The case is In re Hawker Beechcraft Inc., 12-11873, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
