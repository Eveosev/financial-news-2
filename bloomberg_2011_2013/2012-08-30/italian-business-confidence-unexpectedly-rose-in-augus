Italian business confidence
unexpectedly rebounded this month even amid signs the economic
slump will deepen.  The manufacturing-sentiment  index  rose to 87.2 from 87.1 in
July, Rome-based national statistics institute Istat said today.
Economists had predicted a reading of 86.8, according to the
median of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Italy ’s economy contracted for a fourth straight quarter in
the three months through June as Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s
policies contributed to deepening the fourth recession since
2001. Concerns the economic slump will worsen prompted  Fiat SpA (F) 
to temporarily stop new investments in Italy. Chief Executive
Officer Sergio Marchionne has vowed to close a second Italian
factory after shuttering one last year, unless he finds a way to
export cars to the U.S.  The mood among executives doesn’t mirror consumers’
pessimism as Italy’s government implements spending cuts and tax
increases to shield the country from Europe’s debt crisis.
Household confidence declined to 86 in August from 86.5 in the
previous month as the outlook for personal finances worsened.  To contact the reporters on this story:
