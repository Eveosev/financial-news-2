Latvian lawmakers criticized
regulators over the bankruptcy of Krajbanka AS, the Baltic
nation’s sixth-largest lender before it collapsed in 2011.  A decision not to evaluate the lender’s majority owner
because he’d been cleared in  Lithuania , home of Krajbanka’s
parent, Bankas Snoras AB, “had serious negative consequences,”
according to a parliamentary committee report released late
yesterday.  The committee of 11 lawmakers “expressed concern that the
bank regulator’s attitude toward Krajbanka’s insufficient
capital for a long period of time was too tolerant,” according
to the report.  Latvian regulators halted Krajbanka’s operations on Nov. 21
after discovering 167 million lati ($301 million) was missing.
Snoras was seized five days earlier by the Lithuanian government
over similar claims, triggering civil and criminal suits in
 London  against the banks’ former owners,  Vladimir Antonov  and
Raimondas Baranauskas.  The committee recommended tighter rules governing where
municipalities, municipal- and state-owned companies can put
money on deposit and the introduction of criminal liability for
commercial banks’ board members who ignore bank procedures.  -- Editors: Andrew Langley, Alan Crosby  To contact the reporter on this story:
