Validus Holdings Ltd. (VR) , the reinsurer
that failed in a bid to purchase Transatlantic Holdings Inc.
last year, said it will fight to close a deal announced today to
buy  Flagstone Reinsurance Holdings SA. (FSR)   “We never mind rolling up our sleeves and fighting for
something that we think is good for Validus,” Ed Noonan, chief
executive officer of the Bermuda-based firm, said on a
conference call with analysts. “We don’t anticipate it, but we
never shy away from it.”  The deal includes a $24.2 million breakup fee, Validus
President Jeff Consolino said on the call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
