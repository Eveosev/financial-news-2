 European Aeronautic, Defence &
Space Co.’s helicopter unit said it’s exploring plans for a
joint production line of civil choppers in  China .  The plan, which is still preliminary, aims to create a
production facility in Tianjin, where Airbus SAS already makes
planes with a Chinese partner, according to a statement today.  The market for civil helicopters as well as private
 business jets  in China is beginning to open up as the country
relaxes rules allowing private flights. Air space in China is
all controlled by the military though efforts to promote civil
aviation have led to an easing of regulation.  “The new Chinese industrial center will mark an important
step for Eurocopter’s global strategy of being in close
proximity to customers within key markets, while also offering
tailored, flexible solutions adapted to local market
requirements,” Eurocopter Chief Executive Officer Lutz Bertling
said in a statement.  Bertling is traveling with German Chancellor Angela Merkel
on diplomatic visit to Chinese Prime Minister  Wen Jiabao .  To contact the reporter on this story:
