Three students in  Hong Kong  are
refusing food to protest the governmentâ€™s plans to introduce
Chinese national education lessons in city schools,  Radio
Television Hong Kong  reported.  The protesters, members of a student group called
Scholarism, started the three-day hunger strike after earlier
action failed to get results, the broadcaster said, citing
Scholarism member Joshua Wong.  Tens of thousands of parents, students and social activists
took to the streets in Hong Kong in July to oppose the
curriculum changes, which critics say will stifle independent
thinking. The classes aim to foster Chinese identity, the
government said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
