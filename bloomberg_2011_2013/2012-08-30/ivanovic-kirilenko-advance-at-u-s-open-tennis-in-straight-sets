retirement from tennis.  Five-time men’s champion Federer, 31, the top seed from
Switzerland, won 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 against Bjorn Phau of Germany.

fourth this year, defeated Spain’s Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez

Slovakia’s Martin Klizan in the second round for his earliest
exit from a Grand Slam tournament since 2007.  Roddick, the last American man to win a major championship,
said he’ll retire at the end of the tournament. Roddick, who
turned 30 today, has a second-round match tomorrow night.  Roddick, who has won more than $20 million in a career that

Wimbledon finals in 2004, 2005 and 2009 to Federer. He also lost
the 2006 U.S. Open final to Federer.  “I’ve decided that this is going to be my last

has never advanced past the quarterfinals at the U.S. Open, lost
seven of 17 service games against his 23-year-old opponent.  American Winners  “I was not in good shape, I didn’t play good tennis,”

hit the ball enough hard to put my opponent out of position.”  A pair of American men joined Klizan in the third round.

first set and trailed 3-1 in the second before winning the last
11 games in a 4-6, 6-3, 6-0 defeat of Spain’s Carla Suarez Navarro.  Sloane Stephens, a 19-year-old American, reached the third
round for the second straight year with a 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 win
