Greece ’s austerity measures must be
carried out in a way that “helps to protect the most vulnerable
groups,” an International Monetary Fund spokesman said.  An IMF mission will return to Athens next week, fund
spokesman Gerry Rice said at a briefing with reporters in
Washington today. He said Greece faces “a major challenge”
implementing its reforms.  Europe’s economic slump is deepening as governments
struggle to restore investor confidence and companies eliminate
jobs. Economies are stalling or contracting amid concern about a
possible Greek exit from the euro and the ability of Spain and
Italy to service their debts.  IMF Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  spoke with Greek
Prime Minister Antonis Samaras by telephone yesterday to discuss
the economy in Greece and the euro area, Rice said.  Rice also said Spain has taken strong measures to combat
its crisis and hasn’t requested aid from the IMF. The country
will delay deciding whether to seek a sovereign bailout until
the aid conditions are clear, Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said
after a meeting with French President  Francois Hollande .  On  Egypt , Rice said the IMF is prepared to support the
nation and a mission from the fund will arrive there in about
two weeks to resume talks on possible financial support.  Rice also said that talks with Hungary are continuing after
a joint IMF-European Commission team visited in July. No date
has been set for a return visit, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
