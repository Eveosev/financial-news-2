Nickel stockpiles monitored by the
 London  Metal Exchange reached a 16-month high on deliveries into
Rotterdam warehouses.  Inventories rose 498 metric tons, or 0.4 percent, to
118,662 tons, the highest level since April 19, 2011, daily
exchange figures showed. Stocks are up 32 percent this year.
Rotterdam holds 58 percent of total inventories.  Demand for stainless steel, the main source of nickel
consumption, “has steadily fallen back in line with the
slowdown in global growth,” Wiktor Bielski, an analyst at VTB
Capital Plc in London, said in a report Aug. 28. The industry
accounts for 65 percent of nickel usage, according to the Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  Nickel output will exceed demand by 60,000 tons in 2012 and
18,000 tons next year, according to Barclays Plc. The metal for
three-month delivery fell 12 percent this year on the LME, the
most among the six main industrial metals traded on the
exchange. Prices will rise as demand starts to improve next
year, VTB Capital said.  Lead stockpiles monitored by the LME declined 1,100 tons to
311,475 tons, the lowest level since Aug. 15, 2011. Copper
inventories dropped the most in almost four months to 230,175
tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
