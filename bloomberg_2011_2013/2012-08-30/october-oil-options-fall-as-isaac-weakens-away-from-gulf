Near-term crude options slipped to
the lowest level since May as Hurricane  Isaac  weakened to a
tropical storm and moved north into  Louisiana , away from Gulf
Coast refineries and offshore oil production.  Implied volatility for options expiring in October, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 26.68 percent at 2:25 p.m. in  New York , down
from 27.75 percent yesterday. Bets that prices would fall
accounted for 57 percent of electronic trading today.  Crude oil for delivery in October declined 87 cents, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $94.62 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  The most active options in electronic trading today were
October $85 puts, which rose 3 cents to 20 cents a barrel at
2:20 p.m. with 1,326 lots trading. October $90 puts were the
second-most active options, with 1,204 lots changing hands as
they advanced 9 cents to 74 cents a barrel. One contract covers
1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  In the previous session, bullish bets accounted for 57
