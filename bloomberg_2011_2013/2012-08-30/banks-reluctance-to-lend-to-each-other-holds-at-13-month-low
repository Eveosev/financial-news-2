European banks’ reluctance to lend
to one another held near the lowest in more than 13 months,
according to a money market indicator.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was 22.4
basis points, or 0.224 percentage point, at 9:42 a.m. in London,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure was 21.7
basis points yesterday, the lowest since July 5, 2011.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars held at
the lowest since July 22, 2011. The three-month cross-currency
 basis swap , the rate banks pay to convert euro interest payments
into dollars, was unchanged at 30.5 basis points below Euribor.
The one-year basis swap was 35.5 basis points below Euribor from
minus 36 yesterday.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.102
percent yesterday from 0.111 percent the day before. The Eonia
swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing costs over the
next three months, was at 6.6 basis points from 6.9 yesterday.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the European
Central Bank yesterday, placing 334 billion euros ($419 billion)
with the Frankfurt-based central bank from 332 billion euros the
day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
