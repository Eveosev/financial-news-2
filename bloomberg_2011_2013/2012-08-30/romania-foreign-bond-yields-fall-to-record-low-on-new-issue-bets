Yields on  Romania ’s international
bonds fell to a record low on the country’s plan to tap debt
markets with a new issue to beef up the  Finance Ministry ’s
reserves as local debt issuance lagged monthly targets.  The yield on Eurobonds due 2018 declined 9 basis points, or
0.09 percentage point, to 4.852 percent, the lowest on a closing
basis since the securities started trading in July 2010. Yields
on 10-year dollar debt were little changed at 5.63 percent, the
weakest level since the instrument first traded in January,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Romania plans to sell bonds in euros in the next two
months, Deputy Finance Minister Enache Jiru told Bloomberg on
Aug. 23. Reserves with the Finance Minsitry, also known as
financing buffer, depleted to 3.3 billion euros ($4.1 billion)
in July from 4.9 billion euros in April as it repaid maturing
debt and financed the  budget deficit , the ministry said July 25.  “A Eurobond issue later in the fall will consolidate the
central bank’s reserves and contain the upward trend in bond
yields since the finance ministry will be in a position to
reduce the supply of leu-denominated bonds on the local market
in the fourth quarter,” analysts at Banca Comerciala Romana SA
wrote in a report today. “This action however remains tentative
since the investors’ are pretty much skittish these days.”  Romania has pledged to the  International Monetary Fund  it
will maintain a buffer that can finance at least four months of
its budget deficit.  Debt Sale  The ministry sold 1.4 billion lei ($394 million) in local
debt this month against a target of 2.5 billion lei. It raised
1.4 billion lei in June, compared with the 3.5 billion lei it
planned for the month. In July, it borrowed 1.6 billion lei
against a plan of 2.25 billion lei.  The leu gained 0.3 percent to 4.4545 per euro at 2:51 p.m.
in Bucharest, after appreciating 0.5 percent in the past five
days.  The currency hit a record low of 4.6520 per euro on Aug. 3
after a referendum in July to impeach President Traian Basescu.
That vote was invalidated on Aug. 21 by the country’s
 Constitutional Court  as turnout was lower than required, paving
the way for Basescu’s return to office on Aug. 28.  The cost of insuring against a Romanian default for five
years using credit-default swaps was little changed at 393 basis
points, below that of  Italy  at 457 basis points, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
