Serbia will spend 160 million euros
($200 million) to counter the effects of this year’s drought,
which cut corn, soy and sunflower harvests in half in parts of
the Balkan nation.  Rescheduling agriculture loans and providing additional
subsidies to farmers and discounted  diesel fuel  will amount to
the “biggest intervention in the  agriculture sector  in more
than 20 years,” Agriculture Minister Goran Knezevic told
reporters as he presented the measure in Belgrade today. The
cost includes possible use of the state’s commodity reserves to
prevent possible shortage, he said.  “We still won’t be able to annul the effects of the
drought, but we can ease some of the pressure,” he said. The
state will give farmers 6,420 dinars ($67.7) per hectare (2.47
acres) of their arable land, he said.  The cost will be included in reviewed budget spending the
government plans to adopt next month, he said. Serbia is also
struggling to narrow its budget gap, which reached 7.2 percent
of gross domestic product at the end of June, 2.7 percentage
points above the country’s own fiscal rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
