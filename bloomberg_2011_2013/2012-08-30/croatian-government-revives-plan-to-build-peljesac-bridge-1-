Croatia ’s government revived a plan
to build a bridge connecting the southernmost resort of
Dubrovnik with the rest of the country via the Peljesac
peninsula, Foreign Minister  Vesna Pusic  said.  “The bridge is eligible for financing from European Union
funds,” Pusic said in an interview in Zagreb today.  The Adriatic Sea nation is set to become the 28th member of
the bloc in July 2013. The plan to build the bridge, estimated
to cost about 2 billion kuna ($336 million), was started in 2007
and then canceled in May because of a lack of funds.  The bridge, when completed, would allow traffic to avoid
crossing the border with Bosnia-Herzegovina. Building may begin
in 2014, Pusic said.  --Andrew Atkinson, James Gomez  To contact the reporter on this story:
