Maibarara Geothermal Inc ., a
Philippines-based developer, will today begin drilling a new
well at its geothermal project in Batangas province.  The well will be used to re-inject condensate fluids from
the 20-megawatt geothermal project in Santo Tomas into a
reservoir below ground to recharge the system, Maibarara’s
majority owner  Petroenergy Resources Corp. (PERC)  said in a statement.  Maibarara, based in Pasig, announced the plans after this
month completing a third production well to supply steam to the
plant, expected to begin operating late 2013. Geothermal
projects use energy from hot springs or underground steam fields
to produce power.  Maibarara is also owned by  Trans-Asia Oil & Energy
Development (TA)  Corp. and the renewable-energy unit of government-
owned Philippine National Oil Co. It got a 2.4 billion-peso ($57
million) loan deal in September from Rizal Commercial Banking
Corp. and Bank of the Philippine Islands to fund the project’s
steamfield pipeline, power plant and transmission equipment,
according to the company.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
