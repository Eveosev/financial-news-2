A 97-year-old message in a bottle
found by Scottish fishermen in their catch has set the world
record for spending the longest time at sea.  Guinness World Records  confirmed the April 12 discovery by
the Shetland Islands fishing boat, the Scottish Government in
Edinburgh said in an e-mailed statement today.  “It was just a normal day and we were out fishing for
monkfish,” Andrew Leaper, 43, who skippered the boat, Copious,
said in the statement. “As we hauled in the nets, with a mixed
catch of monks, megrim and cod, I spotted the bottle neck
sticking out of the cod end of the net. I quickly grabbed the
bottle before it fell back in the sea.”  The bottle was released on June 10, 1914, by the Glasgow
School of Navigation, one of a batch of 1,890 scientific
research bottles designed to float close to the seabed. The
location of the returned bottles allowed researchers to map the
undercurrents of the seas around  Scotland .  So far, 315 bottles have been found, each containing a note
asking the finder to record the date and place of the discovery
and return it for a reward of sixpence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
