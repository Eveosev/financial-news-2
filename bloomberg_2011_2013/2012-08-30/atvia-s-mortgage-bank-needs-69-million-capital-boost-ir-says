Latvia’s state-owned Hipoteku un
Zemes Banka AS needs 38.4 million lati ($69 million) in capital
after the European Commission asked the country to repay money
that had been improperly used,  Ir  reported.  The mortgage lender had added European Regional Development
money, allocated for lending to businesses, to its capital base
during the Baltic nation’s economic crisis when Hipoteku had a
combined net loss of about 118 million lati over 2009-2010, the
Riga-based magazine reported, citing the  Finance Ministry  and
the bank.  The capital increase, which follows a 25 million-lati boost
in June, was included in budget amendments adopted this month,
the magazine reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
