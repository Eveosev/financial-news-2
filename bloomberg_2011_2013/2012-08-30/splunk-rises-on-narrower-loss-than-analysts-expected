Splunk Inc. (SPLK)  climbed the most in four
months after the maker of software that helps businesses analyze
Web data reported a narrower fiscal second-quarter loss than
analysts estimated and raised its full-year sales forecast.  The shares of San Francisco-based Splunk gained 13 percent
to $34.40 at the close in New York, for the biggest increase
since April 19.  Through yesterday, Splunk had surged 79 percent since
selling shares at $17 apiece in an initial public offering in
April. The company has won business from customers including
 Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) , Bank of America Corp. and  Autodesk Inc. (ADSK) , which are
looking for new ways to monitor and analyze the vast amounts of
data being created by Web services and mobile devices.  Revenue for the 2013 fiscal year ending in January will be
$183 million to $186 million, Splunk said in a statement
yesterday, higher than the company’s prior forecast of $174
million to $177 million.  For the second quarter, which ended July 31, Splunk
reported a net loss of $4.58 million, or 5 cents a share,
compared with a loss of $3.91 million, or 20 cents, a year
earlier. The loss excluding certain items was 1 cent a share,
smaller than analysts’ average estimate for a 3-cent loss,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
