The Airbus A380 wing-crack debacle
may turn out to be a blessing in disguise for the largest
financier of the super jumbo.  “It will, in a strange way, be positive long term because
it has slowed down production,” said Mark Lapidus, managing
director of Doric Asset Finance Ltd, which has financed 13 of
the world’s largest passenger aircraft so far. “Anything that
slows down the production rate increases the value of the
existing fleet we have.”  Airbus SAS’s flagship model has struggled with cracks that
emerged in wing components, disrupting production that will drop
in 2013 and is trailing behind the annual goal of 30 deliveries
this year. Airbus is working with regulators on a long-term fix
for the cracks, and the company has cautioned that reaching its
goal of 30 new orders this year is a stretch.  Doric has financed eight A380s for Emirates Airline, the
biggest operator of the double-decker jet, and five for
 Singapore Airlines (SIA) , the A380’s first customer in 2007. There are
80 A80s in operation around the world today, and customers have
ordered 257 of the double-decker, according to Airbus’s tally at
the end of July.  The London-based financing company will see its fleet grow
to 18 A380s by the end of April 2013, Lapidus said in a
telephone interview. Doric is in financing talks with other A380
customers, including  China Southern Airlines Co. (1055) ,  Korean Air
Lines Co. (003490)  and  Malaysian Airline System Bhd. (MAS)   ‘Underappreciated’  “It is not that we are fascinated with the A380,” Lapidus
said. “We see it as an underappreciated aircraft by both the
lessor community, about which we are very happy, and by some of
the airlines that have not tasted the aircraft in their fleet
yet.”  One case where product familiarity may lead to additional
A380 orders is  British Airways (IAG) , Lapidus said. The International
Consolidated Airlines Group SA unit is scheduled to receive the
first of 12 of the aircraft it has on firm order next year.  “They will have to operate more,” Lapidus said, pointing
to the carrier’s network and service to major cities such as
 Hong Kong  or  New York . On flights to the New York area alone,
British Airways “would need less crewing and fewer pilots and
their costs would improve significantly” by using the A380, he
said.  Doric’s portfolio now includes $4.6 billion in aviation
assets under management. The company yesterday took delivery of
its 13th A380 to bring its total fleet to 30 aircraft placed
with nine airlines. The A380 was acquired under the Sky Cloud IV
fund that has leased the aircraft for 12 years to Emirates.  In addition to A380s, Doric has financed six Boeing 777
wide-bodies, two Airbus A340-600s, one A330-200 and eight A320s.  The company has also bid on financing Boeing 787
Dreamliners, Lapidus said, though so far failed to win a
customer. Financing more 777s is also on the agenda.  To help with aircraft financing at a time when many banks
have withdrawn access to debt, Doric this year used a first of
its kind U.S. corporate bond offering for four Emirates A380s,
selling $587.5 million in secured debt. More such deals are
being looked at, Lapidus said.  Doric wants to expand its investor base beyond its core
German and U.K. market, Lapidus said.  “We are definitely looking into the U.S. and we are very
interested in developing something in  Japan ,” he said. Those
efforts are likely to materialize next year, Lapidus said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
