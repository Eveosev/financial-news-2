India ’s 10-year bonds headed for a
monthly advance on speculation data due tomorrow will show the
economy slowed for a fifth straight quarter, adding pressure on
the central bank to ease monetary policy.  Asia ’s third-largest economy probably expanded 5.2 percent
in the three months through June, according to the median
estimate of 39 economists in Bloomberg News survey. That would
be the slowest pace since 2009. The  Reserve Bank  of India, which
cut the repurchase rate by 50 basis points to 8 percent in April
and left it unchanged last month, will next review policy on
Sept. 17.  “Gross domestic product growth below 5 percent would
likely strengthen market expectations of a rate cut at the RBI’s
September policy meeting,” analysts at Standard Chartered Plc,
including Mumbai-based Anubhuti Sahay, wrote in a research note
today. “A print below 5 percent would likely soften both the
10-year bond yield and short-end overnight index swap rates by
about 10 basis points.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 has
fallen six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, this month to
8.19 percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate rose one basis point today. The yield on
benchmark 10 year notes dropped 38 basis points this year.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose four basis
points this month to 7.77 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. They fell one basis point today today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
