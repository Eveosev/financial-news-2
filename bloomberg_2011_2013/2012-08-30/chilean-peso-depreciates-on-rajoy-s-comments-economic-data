Chile’s peso weakened after comments
from Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  stoked concerns that
Europe’s debt crisis may deepen.  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 481.15 per dollar as of 12:43
p.m. in Santiago. The dollar gained against all but three of the
25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Spain will delay a decision on whether or not to ask for a
sovereign bailout until it is clear what is being offered, Rajoy
said today. The  U.S. dollar  strengthened to the highest in a
week against its major counterparts and global stocks fell the
most in three weeks as Japan reported a drop in retail sales,
data showed rising unemployment in Germany and  South Korea 
reported manufacturer’s confidence near the lowest level since
2009.  “Markets are negative, stocks are down and that’s
supporting the dollar” and hurting the peso, said Ronald Volpi,
the head of spot currency trading at EuroAmerica Corredores de
Bolsa SA in Santiago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
