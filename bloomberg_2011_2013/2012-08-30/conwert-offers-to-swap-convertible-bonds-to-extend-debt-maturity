Conwert Immobilien Invest SE (CWI) , an
Austrian company that buys and renovates apartment blocks, is
offering to swap convertible bonds for new notes that mature
four years later.  The 80 million euros ($100 million) of new bonds will carry
a semi-annual coupon of 4.5 percent and expire in 2018, Vienna-
based Conwert said today. The bonds can be handed over for stock
when the shares rise to 11.59 euros, the bank said in a separate
statement. Investors can also exchange their 2014 bonds for
cash.  The exchange is aimed at reducing leverage and extending
the maturity of debt, the company said.  Conwert fell 3.2 percent to 8.88 euros at the 5:30 p.m.
close of trading in Vienna, the biggest decline in more than an
month. The convertible notes traded at 108.13 euros.  The 2014 bonds pay a 1.5 percent annual cash coupon, plus
1.5 percent accrued interest, which adds up to coupon payments
of about 3 percent, said Conwert spokesman Clemens Billek. The
bonds will be exchanged at a price of about 108 euros plus
interest, for every 100 euros in face value.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  is the bookrunner on the deal and Raiffeisen
Centrobank AG is the co-lead manager.  To contact the reporter on this story:
