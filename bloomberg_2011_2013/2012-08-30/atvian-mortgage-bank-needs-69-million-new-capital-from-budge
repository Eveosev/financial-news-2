Latvia’s state-owned Hipoteku un
Zemes Banka AS needs 38.4 million lati ($69 million) in capital
after the European Commission asked the country to repay cash
that had been improperly used, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The mortgage lender needs the money to replace European
structural funds that had been added to the bank’s capital base,
Aleksis Jarocksis, a spokesman for the ministry, said today by
e-mail. The capital increase will come from additional budget
spending, he said. The news was reported earlier today by the  Ir 
magazine.  The lender received a 25 million-lati capital boost in June
after it agreed to sell loan portfolios and pension assets to
units of  Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  and  SEB AB (SEBA)  as part of a restructuring.
Hipoteku had a combined net loss of about 118 million lati in
2009 and 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
