WhatClinic.com , an Irish provider of

countries, obtained a 2 million-euro ($2.5 million) investment
from Delta Partners, the Irish Times said, citing What.com
founder Caelen King and Delta General Partner Maurice Roche.  The investment will allow WhatClinic.com to add 30
employees to its current 20 and start a Portuguese-language site
