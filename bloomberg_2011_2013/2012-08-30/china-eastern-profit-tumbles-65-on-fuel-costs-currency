China Eastern Airlines Corp. (670) , the
nation’s second-largest carrier by passengers, said first-half
profit tumbled 65 percent because of higher fuel costs and
currency losses.  Net income fell to 806.9 million  yuan  ($127 million) from
2.28 billion yuan a year earlier, the Shanghai-based airline
said in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing yesterday. That
compares with the 786 million-yuan average of three analyst
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Sales rose 5.6 percent to
40.2 billion yuan.  The carrier joins  China Southern Airlines Co. (1055)  and Air China
Ltd. in reporting lower profit after its average fuel prices
rose 10 percent and traffic growth cooled on the nation’s
slowing economy. The company also made a 228 million yuan
exchange loss, compared with a year-earlier gain, as the weaker
yuan raised the repatriated value of dollar-denominated debts.  Passenger numbers rose 4.1 percent to 34.6 million,  China
Eastern  said. That’s compared with a 10 percent increase a year
earlier. Load factor, or the percentage of seats filled by
paying customers, rose 1.1 percentage points from a year earlier
to 79.1 percent.  The  carrier  climbed 2.1 percent to HK$2.39 in Hong Kong
yesterday. It has declined 13 percent this year, compared with a
15 percent drop for China Southern and an 18 percent decline for
Air China. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  has climbed 6.1 percent.  The Chinese currency weakened 0.95 percent against the
dollar in the first six months, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. That was the first half-year decline
since 2009.  China Eastern didn’t propose an interim dividend. China
Southern reported an 85 percent slump in first-half profit this
week while Air China posted a 77 percent drop.  To contact the reporters on this story:
