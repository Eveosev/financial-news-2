Alberta will record a wider  budget
deficit  in the fiscal year that began April 1 because of
declining revenue from oil, Finance Minister Doug Horner said.  The deficit will widen to a range between C$2.3 billion
($2.32 billion) and C$3 billion, up from an original forecast of
C$886 million, Horner said on a conference call with media from
the provincial capitol of Edmonton. The province’s outlook for
oil has been cut to an average of $92.75 a barrel from an
initial forecast of $99.25 on Feb. 9, government documents show.
Oil has averaged $92.42 Since April 1.  “My mandate is to have a balanced budget in 2013-14,”
Horner said. “That’s my target and that’s where I’m headed.”
The provincial economy is set to grow by 3.8 percent this year,
according to a government document, with a budget surplus of
C$952 million forecast for the 2013-14 fiscal year.  Alberta posted a deficit of C$588 million in the first
quarter of this fiscal year, higher than the initially forecast
C$194 million, on lower oil royalties and taxes due to price
declines for the  fossil fuel . The government gets a third of its
revenue from royalties and taxation of the oil and gas industry.
Alberta is home to the world’s third-largest oil reserves after
 Saudi Arabia  and  Venezuela .  To contact the reporter on this story:
