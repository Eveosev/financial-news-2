China ’s armed forces are capable of
protecting the country’s maritime rights including islands
claimed by both China and Japan, the Xinhua News Agency
reported, citing Defense Ministry spokesman Geng Yansheng.  Any action by Japan cannot change China’s claim over the
islands, Geng said according to Xinhua. The islands are known as
the Diaoyu in Chinese and the Senkaku in Japanese.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
