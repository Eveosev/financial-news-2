Kentz Corp. (KENZ) , an Irish oil and gas
engineering company with clients including  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , is
seeking acquisitions after cash reserves increased.  “There is a strategy to acquire certain additional skills
that we can offer to our clients,” Chief Financial Officer
Edward Power said today in a phone interview. “We have a strong
cash position that will help.”  Net cash increased 36 percent to $241 million in the first
half, the Tipperary-based company said today in a statement.
Kentz is bidding for $4.4 billion of projects within the next
year after its portfolio backlog rose to $2.5 billion.  Kentz bought RNE Engineering and Projects (Pty) Ltd., a
South African service company, for about $10 million last year.
Mergers and acquisitions in the oil-field services industry will
grow in the next two years, Ernst & Young LLP said yesterday.  Kentz advanced 5 percent to 400 pence by the close of
London trading, the company’s biggest gain since June 19.  The margin on profit before tax rose to 7.3 percent from
5.9 percent a year earlier. Kentz sees an annual margin similar
to  analyst consensus  of 6.3 percent to 6.5 percent, Power said.  It “turned out a little bit better than we had expected,”
he said, adding the margin is set to drop in the second half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
