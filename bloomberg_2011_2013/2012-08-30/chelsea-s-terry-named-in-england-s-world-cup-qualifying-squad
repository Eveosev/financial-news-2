Chelsea captain  John Terry  was among
the 24 players named to the England soccer squad which opens
qualifying for the 2014 World Cup next week.  Terry faces a Football Association hearing after being
accused of using a racial slur against QPR’s Anton Ferdinand in
a Premier League game last October, a charge he denies. The
defender was cleared in a London court in July of racially
abusing Ferdinand.  England manager Roy Hodgson has  recalled Terry  to the squad
for qualifiers in Moldova on Sept. 7 and at home against Ukraine
four days later after leaving him out of an exhibition win over
Italy on Aug. 15.  QPR goalkeeper Robert Green was dropped after serving as a
backup to  Joe Hart  for this summer’s European Championship,
replaced by Norwich’s  John Ruddy , who played against Italy.
Birmingham’s Jack Butland also remains in reserve to Hart.  Tottenham defender  Kyle Walker  was recalled after missing
Euro 2012 with a broken toe, with Manchester United winger
Ashley Young left out after playing at the Euros and against
Italy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
