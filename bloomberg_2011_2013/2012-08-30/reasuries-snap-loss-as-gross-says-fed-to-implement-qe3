Treasuries rose, pushing 10-year
yields to the lowest level in three weeks, as data showing
slower inflation bolstered bets Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  has more room to add monetary stimulus to spur growth.  Ten-year notes reversed a decline from yesterday as a
measure of inflation in a Commerce Department report increased
the least since October 2009. Thirty-year yields approached the
lowest in more than two weeks as the Fed bought long bonds in a
program to cap borrowing costs. The Treasury will auction $29
billion in seven-year notes today.  “The focus remains on what’s going to happen with
Bernanke,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist in
Philadelphia at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, which oversees $12
billion in fixed income assets. “Inflation is clearly
decelerating, and we are facing a period of potential deflation
risk. That’s the core argument behind the Fed’s stimulus-at-any-
cost policy.”  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year note fell three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.63 percent at 12:14 p.m.
New York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It
touched 1.61 percent, matching Aug. 28’s low, the least since
Aug. 8. The price of the 1.625 percent security due in August
2022 gained 7/32, or $2.19 per $1,000 face amount, to 100.  Ten-year yields touched a record low of 1.38 percent July
25. They averaged 3.73 percent over the past decade.  Thirty-year bond  yields dropped three basis points to 2.73
percent. They touched 2.72 percent Aug. 28, the lowest level
since Aug. 13.  Euro Falls  Treasuries extended gains as the euro erased an advance
versus the dollar after Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said  Spain 
will delay deciding whether to seek a bailout until aid
conditions are clear. The shared currency weakened 0.3 percent
to $1.2498 after rising earlier as much as 0.3 percent. Stocks
fell, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index losing 0.7 percent.  The seven-year U.S. securities being sold today yielded
1.085 percent in pre-auction trading. They drew a record low
auction yield of 0.954 percent at the prior sale on July 26.  At that offering, investors submitted  orders  to buy 2.64
times the amount of debt available, matching the lowest bid-to-
cover ratio since October. Indirect bidders, a category that
includes central banks outside the U.S., purchased 46.3 percent
of the securities, the most in 11 months.  Week’s Auctions  Today’s offering is the last of three note sales this week
totaling $99 billion. The U.S. sold $35 billion of five-year
notes yesterday at a yield of 0.708 percent, below the 0.716
percent forecast in a Bloomberg survey. It auctioned an equal
amount of two-year notes the previous day at a  yield  of 0.273
percent and a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.94, above the average
ratio of 3.75 at the past 10 sales.  Treasuries have lost 0.6 percent in August, paring their
gain for the year to 2.1 percent. They returned 9.8 percent in
2011.  The Fed purchased $1.8 billion of Treasuries today due from
February 2036 to May 2042, according to the Fed Bank of New
York’s  website . The central bank is in the process of swapping
shorter-term Treasuries in its holdings with those due in six to
30 years to put downward pressure on long-term  interest rates .
Traders call the effort Operation Twist after a similar program
in the 1960s.  Jackson Hole  Bernanke will address the Kansas City Fed’s annual
economic-policy conference in  Jackson Hole  tomorrow. Many policy
makers at the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s last meeting said
additional stimulus probably will be needed soon unless the
economy shows signs of a durable pickup, according to minutes of
the July 31-Aug. 1 policy discussions.  The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of assets in two
rounds of the stimulus strategy called quantitative easing from
2008 to 2011.  “The perception is that economic growth is moving forward
at stall speed and market participants like the Fed remain
vigilant for any signs that growth is decelerating from this
already-subdued pace,” said  Chris Ahrens , an interest-rate
strategist at UBS AG in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . The firm is one
of the 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed and are
obliged to bid in U.S. debt auctions.  Bernanke’s remarks at the past two Jackson Hole conferences
signaled moves to spur economic growth. At the August 2011
event, he said the Fed “has a range of tools that could be used
to provide additional monetary stimulus.” The central bank
announced Operation Twist on Sept. 21.  At the Wyoming conference on Aug. 27, 2010, Bernanke said
the U.S. central bank “will do all that it can” to ensure a
continuation of the economic recovery and that more securities
purchases might be warranted if growth slowed. It announced a
$600 billion round of Treasury purchases in November 2010.  Inflation Gauge  Treasuries rose today as Commerce Department data showed a
gauge of prices tied to  consumer spending  advanced 1.3 percent
in the 12 months ended in July, the smallest gain since October
2009 and below the Fed’s long-run goal of 2 percent. Excluding
food and energy costs, the measure increased 1.6 percent in the
past year.  U.S. consumer spending rose in July for the first time in
three months, increasing 0.4 percent, department data showed.  A separate report from the Labor Department showed initial
claims for jobless benefits in the U.S. were little changed last
week from an upwardly revised figure for the prior week.  The 10-year  term premium , a model created by economists at
the Fed that includes expectations for interest rates, growth
and inflation, was at negative 0.89 percent today, the most
expensive level in three weeks. A negative reading indicates
investors are willing to accept yields below what’s considered
fair value.  To contact the reporters on this story:
