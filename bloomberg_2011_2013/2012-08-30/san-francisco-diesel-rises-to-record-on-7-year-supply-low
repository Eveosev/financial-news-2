Spot diesel in  San Francisco  rose to
the highest level against futures since at least 2007 after a
fire at  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Rodeo refinery in Northern California
yesterday was said to shut the coker plant.  Phillips 66 was circulating fuel through a section of the
coker while a second area was shut for repairs, a person with
knowledge of the incident said.  The unit, which converts heavy oil feedstocks into lighter
products such as naphtha and heating oil, was expected to run at
50 percent of capacity later today and at full rates by the end
of the week, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the information isn’t public.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in San Francisco gained 1
cent to 34 cents a gallon above heating oil futures on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange at 1:47 p.m. East Coast time, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s the highest premium for the
fuel since Bloomberg began assessing prices there in November
2007.  The refinery extinguished a “small fire” in a unit
yesterday,  Rich Johnson , a Phillips 66 spokesman at the
company’s headquarters in Houston, said by e-mail. He declined
to comment on the unit’s status.  CARB Diesel  CARB diesel in  Los Angeles  advanced 2.5 cents to 33 cents a
gallon above Nymex heating oil futures, the highest level in
more than nine months.  CARB diesel inventories  tumbled 15 percent, or 303,000
barrels, to 1.75 million in the week ended Aug. 24, the state
Energy Commission said by e-mail. That’s the lowest level since
August 2005 and the third weekly decline.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s 158,000-barrel-a-day Martinez
refinery in Northern California reported a planned shutdown of
the flexicoker Aug. 28, a filing with the Contra Costa County
hazardous materials division showed.  Tesoro Corp. (TSO) ’s 170,000-
barrel-a-day Golden Eagle refinery also cut diesel output last
week after a compressor failure at a hydrodesulfurization unit,
a person with direct knowledge of the upset said Aug. 21.  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  has been producing fuels at a reduced
capacity at the 240,000-barrel-a-day Richmond refinery, the
largest in Northern California, since an Aug. 6 fire shut the
plant’s only crude unit.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in San Francisco
gained 1.5 cents to 25.5 cents a gallon above Nymex gasoline
futures. The same fuel in Los Angeles rose 3.5 cents to 25.5
cents a gallon over futures.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland,  Oregon ,
jumped 8 cents to a premium of 35 cents a gallon. The fuel began
to be priced against October futures instead of the September
contract yesterday. Low-sulfur diesel in  Portland  increased 4
cents to 30.5 cents a gallon above heating oil futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
