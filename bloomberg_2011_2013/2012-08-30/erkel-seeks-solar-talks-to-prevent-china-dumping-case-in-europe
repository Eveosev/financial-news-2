German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
seeks talks involving the European Commission and Chinese
authorities to prevent the opening of anti-dumping proceedings
against Chinese solar-panel makers in  Europe .  Merkel proposed trying “to solve the problems in the solar
sector so one can prevent that an anti-dumping case has to be
opened,” she told reporters today in Beijing. “There’s still
time, and it would be better to solve this in talks.”  Solarworld AG (SWV) ,  Germany ’s biggest panel maker, is leading a
push by about 25 European manufacturers for the commission to
probe whether Chinese rivals sold products at a loss on regional
markets. The U.S. has proposed anti-dumping duties ranging from
31 percent to 250 percent on Chinese solar manufacturers after
the Commerce Department in May ruled they sold products below
costs.  The filing highlights tensions with  China  over aid for
wind-power and solar companies, which have grabbed market share
from European rivals that once dominated the industry. The
increased competition has cut profit margins, cutting solar-
panel prices by half last year and tipping more than a dozen
companies into bankruptcy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
