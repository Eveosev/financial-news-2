Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  said its Kindle Fire
tablet has sold out, a week before the company is expected to
unveil an updated version of the device.  “What they’re really announcing is that there’s another
Kindle Fire on the way,” said James Cordwell, an analyst at
Atlantic Equities Service in London. “There’s no other reason
they’d say it’s sold out.”  The Kindle Fire has captured 22 percent of the U.S. tablet
market since it went on sale in November, Seattle-based Amazon
said today in a statement, without disclosing the number of
devices sold. Researcher IDC pegged Amazon’s share of the
worldwide tablet market at 4 percent in the first quarter,
compared with 17 percent in the period that ended in December.  Amazon, the world’s biggest online retailer, will hold a
press conference on Sept. 6 in  Santa Monica ,  California . The
company may announce upgrades to its Kindle e-reader devices or
the Kindle Fire, said Kerry Rice, an analyst at Needham & Co.  “Kindle Fire is sold out, but we have an exciting roadmap
ahead,” Chief Executive Officer  Jeff Bezos  said in the
statement.  Seattle-based Amazon fell 0.4 percent to $246.22 at the
close in  New York . The stock has gained 42 percent this year.
