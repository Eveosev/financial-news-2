Total SA (FP)  and GDF Suez said it’s too
early to decide whether to expand a liquefied natural gas plant
that processes output from their Snohvit field in the  Barents
Sea , the option preferred by operator  Statoil ASA. (STL)   “We’re not there yet,” Martin Tiffen, head of Total’s
Norway unit, said today in Stavanger. “It’s an option.”  Expanding the Hammerfest plant would be the “best solution
economically,” rather than building a southbound pipeline, if
the partners decide to double output at Snohvit, the first field
developed in the Arctic Barents Sea, Statoil said in July.  “Neither, today, is like a slam dunk from an economical
point of view,” Tiffen said in an interview. “It could be
both. But these things take time.”  Statoil, Norway’s largest oil and gas producer, in April
said it may increase Snohvit output to deplete reserves and free
up capacity as it prepares to develop other Arctic discoveries.  “ GDF Suez (GSZ)  thinks that several issues and alternative
solutions still need to be studied and agreed before we can
recommend how to best complete the development of Snohvit,” Ulf
Rosenberg, a spokesman for GDF, said in an e-mailed statement.  Statoil has 36.8 percent of Snohvit, Petoro AS 30 percent,
Total 18.4 percent, GDF 12 percent and RWE-DEA AG 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
