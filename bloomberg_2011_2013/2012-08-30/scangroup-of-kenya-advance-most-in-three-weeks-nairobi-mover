Scangroup Ltd. (SCAN) ,  East Africa ’s
biggest marketing company by sales, climbed to its highest level
in two weeks on bets full-year earnings will be boosted by a
jump in advertising for election campaigns.  Shares in the company advanced 1.8 percent to 57.50
shillings by the close in Nairobi, the highest since Aug. 15.  “This is a strong year for advertising companies because
there will be a lot of activity toward the end of the year as
campaigns begin,” John Kamunya, a research analyst at Nairobi-

Benckiser Group Plc (RB/)  and Coca-Cola Co., who are among Kenya’s top

for 60 percent of Scangroup’s total billings, according to
Kestrel Capital (East Africa) Ltd., a Nairobi-based brokerage.  Scangroup profit climbed to 406.6 million shillings in the
