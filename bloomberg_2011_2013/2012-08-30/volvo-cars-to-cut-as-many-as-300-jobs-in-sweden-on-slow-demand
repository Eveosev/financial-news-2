Volvo Car Corp. will cut its
workforce by 200 to 300 people at its Swedish factory in
response to weak European demand, a union official said.  Volvo will reduce production by about 10 percent at its
main plant in Gothenburg in southwestern  Sweden  starting Oct. 1,
Michael Blohm, a spokesman for the IF Metall union at Volvo,
said in a phone interview today. Management has said that
production at the plant will fall from the current 57 cars per
hour to about 52, he said.  “It’s sad when people are asked to leave but if there
aren’t enough orders to build cars then there simply isn’t work
for anyone,” Blohm said.  European car sales have fallen for nine consecutive months,
according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association.
The group forecasts that passenger car sales in the European
Union will shrink 7 percent this year to 12.2 million vehicles,
21 percent below the 2007 peak and the weakest demand since
1995.  About 500,000 European jobs at automakers and their
suppliers may be lost before the end of next year, according to
Lars Holmqvist, who headed European auto supplier group Clepa
until April and is now senior adviser on auto issues at
consultant Kreab Gavin Anderson in Brussels. The European  auto
industry  employs about 7 million workers.  Stefan Elfstrom, a Volvo spokesman, declined to comment.
Volvo will discuss potential job cuts on Sept. 5, when the
company publishes its first-half results, he said.  Volvo, which  Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. (175)  bought from
 Ford Motor Co. (F)  in August 2010 for $1.8 billion, has a target of
almost doubling sales to 800,000 cars and sport-utility vehicles
by 2020 from 449,255 deliveries in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
