Gold declined for a third day as
investors weighed whether the  Federal Reserve  will signal a new
round of measures to boost the economy tomorrow and as Spain
said it will delay a decision on seeking aid.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will speak tomorrow at an
annual meeting in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming, where in 2010 he
foreshadowed $600 billion of bond buying. U.S. consumer spending
rose in July for the first time in three months, while more
Americans than forecast applied for unemployment  benefits  last
week, separate government reports showed today. Spain’s Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said the country will delay seeking a
sovereign bailout until the aid conditions are clear.  “The U.S. data has been mixed, so people are unsure about
tomorrow,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “Also, the worries
about Europe are back in the forefront, and investors are moving
out of commodities.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.4 percent to
settle at $1,657.10 an ounce at 1:52 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Prices dropped 0.8 percent in the previous two sessions on
bets that Bernanke will refrain from announcing fresh stimulus
measures, reducing the appeal of the metal as a hedge against
inflation.  Bullion surged 70 percent from the end of December 2008 to
June 2011 as the Fed kept borrowing costs at a record low and
bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of quantitative
easing.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
slid as much as 0.6 percent.  Silver futures for December delivery declined 1.5 percent
to $30.446 an ounce in New York, the biggest fall for a most-
active contract since Aug. 2.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery retreated 1.1 percent to $1,503.70 an ounce,
the fifth straight decline and the longest losing streak since
June 22. Palladium futures for December delivery slumped 3.2
percent to $616.40 an ounce, the biggest fall since May 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
