Swire Properties Ltd. (1972)  has sold an
apartment in the first residential building in Asia designed by
Frank Gehry, the designer of Bilbao’s Guggenheim Museum, for
HK$430 million ($55 million).  The 6,755-square-foot apartment is in a 12-floor building
known as Opus  Hong Kong  and is located on The Peak, home to some
of the city’s most expensive housing, the company said in a
statement today. Swire earlier leased another apartment, which
has its own pool, at a monthly rental of HK$850,000 for three
years, according to the statement.  Swire, the owner of Pacific Place and Island East office
and shopping mall complexes in Hong Kong, has seen demand for
prime  office space  in the city weakening, Chief Executive
Officer Martin Cubbon said earlier this month. First-half
underlying profit rose 3.8 percent on rental income growth, the
company said Aug. 10.  “We embarked on this project with  Frank Gehry  with the
intention of producing an exceptionally rare work of
architecture,” Cubbon said in today’s statement. “These
transactions demonstrate the market’s appreciation for our
achievement.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
