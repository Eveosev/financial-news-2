Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
said President Giorgio Napolitano is the victim of
“unacceptable insinuations in the press” regarding recordings
made by prosecutors of phone calls with the head of state’s
office.  “We must oppose every attempt to destabilize the
country,” Monti’s office said today in an e-mailed statement.
“The country will know how to react to defend the exemplary
constitutional values present in President Napolitano and his
unflagging effort at the exclusive service of the nation.”  Napolitano is challenging the constitutionality of the
recordings by the prosecutors in Palermo who are investigating
allegations of relations between the Sicilian mafia and state
officials in the early 1990s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
