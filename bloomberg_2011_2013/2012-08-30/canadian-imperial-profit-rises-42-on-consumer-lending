Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ,
the country’s fifth-biggest bank, said third-quarter profit rose
42 percent on  consumer lending , beating analysts’ estimates. The
bank raised its dividend for the first time in a year.  Net income for the quarter ended July 31 was C$841 million
($848 million), or C$2 a share, compared with C$591 million, or
C$1.33, a year earlier, the Toronto-based bank said today in a
statement. Revenue rose 0.6 percent to C$3.15 billion.  Consumer lending and business banking earnings rose 7.8
percent to C$594 million. CIBC was aided by contributions from
its August 2011 purchase of 41 percent of American Century
Investments, which added to wealth management profit of C$76
million, an 8.6 percent increase from a year ago.  The bank is countering a consumer lending slowdown by
expanding in wealth management with takeovers including this
month’s agreement to buy MFS McLean Budden’s private wealth
business.  “This segment has flown under the radar but constitutes a
major component of the bank’s growth strategy,” National Bank
Financial analyst  Peter Routledge  said in an Aug. 16 note.  CIBC said it had adjusted earnings of C$2.06 a share,
beating the C$1.96 a share average  estimate  of 15 analysts
surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  CIBC is reorganizing its retail-banking business to shift
away from using mortgage brokers in favor of selling home loans
and other financial products through branches. CIBC said June 20
it’s closing its FirstLine Mortgages origination business after
failing to sell the operation. CIBC said it’ll stop issuing
FirstLine mortgages as of July 31.  CIBC agreed Aug. 7 to buy the private-wealth business of
MFS McLean Budden, a unit of  Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) , to bolster
its wealth-management operations. McLean Budden manages about
C$1.4 billion in assets for wealthy individuals and families,
endowments and foundations.  Canadian Imperial is the first of four lenders disclosing
quarterly results today, following reports by larger competitors
 Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)  and  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  on Aug. 28 that beat
analysts’ estimates. The other lenders reporting today are Royal
Bank of Canada,  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  and  National Bank of
Canada. (NA)   Canadian Imperial raised its quarterly  payout  4.4 percent
to 94 cents.  (CIBC will hold a conference call to discuss results at
+1-416-340-2217 or +1-866-696-5910 passcode 3201624 starting at
8:30 a.m. Toronto time.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
