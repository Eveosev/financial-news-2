West Ham signed striker Andy Carroll
from Liverpool on a season-long loan with an option to make the
move permanent at the end of the Premier League soccer campaign.  Carroll’s place at Liverpool had been in question after
 Brendan Rodgers  was named manager in the offseason. The England
international had been linked with a return to Newcastle, which
sold the 23-year-old to the Reds in January 2011 for 35 million
pounds ($55 million).  “For all the parties this is a great signing,” Hammers
manager  Sam Allardyce  said on the team’s website. “Hopefully he
can score goals for us and we will be in a very good position at
the end of the year.”  Carroll was never able to establish himself at Liverpool,
scoring 11 goals in 56 games. He had 31 goals in 80 appearances
from 2006-11 for Newcastle, where he played under Allardyce.  “He was a massive reason for me coming,” Carroll said of
his new coach. “When I worked with him at Newcastle it was
great so it was a no-brainer really.”  Carroll has scored two goals in eight appearances for his
country. He was named today to the squad for England’s first two
qualifiers for the 2014  World Cup  next month, against Moldova
and Ukraine.  West Ham has a win and a loss in its first two games since
returning to the Premier League from the second-tier
Championship. The Hammers host Fulham in two days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
