U.S. Gulf Coast oils strengthened as
refiners prepared to restore output after Hurricane Isaac. The
difference between West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude oil
widened.  Isaac, which has halted 95 percent of U.S. oil production
in the Gulf, weakened into a tropical storm as it headed toward
 Arkansas . Valero Corp. is returning workers to the Meraux and
St. Charles plants, while Placid Refining Co. is resuming
operations at its Port Allen,  Louisiana , refinery.  WTI’s discount versus Brent gained 98 cents to $18.03 a
barrel. When Brent increases at a faster pace than WTI, it
usually strengthens the value of the U.S. grades that compete
with foreign oils priced against the European benchmark.  The premium for Heavy Louisiana Sweet versus West Texas
Intermediate added $1.40 to $18.10 a barrel at 2:19 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange . Light Louisiana Sweet gained $1 to
$17 over WTI.  The  difference  between Poseidon and the U.S. benchmark
widened by 90 cents to $13 a barrel, while Mars Blend added 50
cents to $12.50. Southern Green Canyon was unchanged at $11.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, was steady at a
premium of $17 a barrel.  Syncrude’s premium above WTI rose 35 cents to $2.85. The
discount for Bakken oil from  North Dakota  widened by $2.50 to $3
while Western Canada Select’s dropped 25 cents to $16.25.  West Texas Sour weakened 5 cents to trade $3.85 below WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
