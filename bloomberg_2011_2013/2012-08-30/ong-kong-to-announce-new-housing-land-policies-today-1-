Hong Kong  Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying will announce new housing policies today as the city’s
 home prices  defied previous government attempts to cool the
market.  Leung will hold a briefing at 5:15 p.m. local time, the
government said in a statement, without giving details.  The chief executive, who took office in July, said earlier
this month the government will seek to prevent “over-
expansion” of bank credit to “ensure the healthy development
of the residential market.”  Home prices  have recovered from a
decline in the second half of last year even as the government
lowered its growth forecast for 2012 and as the Chinese economy
slows down.  “The measures should have some cooling effect,” said
Ringo Lam, Hong Kong-based director of valuation at property
broker AG Wilkinson. “We have to look at the details to assess
the magnitude of the impact.”  Leung was elected after pledging to boost housing supply to
bridge a widening wealth gap and rein in property prices that
have gained more than 85 percent since early 2009. Since taking
office, Leung has said he will stick to his commitment to
restart a subsidized housing program halted in 2004.  The seven-member  Hang Seng Property Index (HSP)  fell 2.8 percent
today, the biggest drop since May 16, after Sing Tao Daily
reported today that the government will announce new measures to
cool home prices as early as next week.  Savills Plc (SVS)  said Hong Kong is the world’s costliest place
to buy an apartment, with prices about 85 percent higher than in
 London , where the property broker is based.  To contact the reporters on this story:
