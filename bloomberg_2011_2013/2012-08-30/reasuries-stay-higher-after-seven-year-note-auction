Treasuries rose, pushing 10-year
yields to the lowest level in three weeks, as data showing that
inflation slowed bolstered demand at a $29 billion note sale
before Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  speaks tomorrow.  Thirty-year yields touched the lowest in more than two
weeks as the Fed bought long bonds in a program to cap borrowing
costs and a measure of inflation rose the least since October
2009. Bernanke may discuss further monetary stimulus in his
speech in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming . Seven-year notes sold today
 yielded  1.081 percent, versus a forecast of 1.087 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of eight of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers.  “There is still demand for Treasuries, as a very dovish
Jackson Hole speech is expected tomorrow,” said  Scott Graham ,
head of government bond trading at Bank of Montreal’s BMO
Capital Markets unit in  Chicago . As a primary dealer, BMO is
obliged to bid in U.S. debt sales. “The auction was strong, as
there are lots of bullish underpinnings in the market.”  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year note fell three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.62 percent at 5 p.m.  New
York  time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It touched
1.61 percent, the lowest level since Aug. 8. The price of the
1.625 percent security due in August 2022 gained 1/4, or $2.50
per $1,000 face amount, to 100.  Ten-year yields reached a record low of 1.38 percent July
25 before climbing to a three-month high of 1.86 percent on Aug.
21. They averaged 3.73 percent over the past decade.  Long Bonds  Thirty-year bond  yields declined two basis points to 2.75
percent and touched 2.72 percent, the least since Aug. 13.  Yields on the current  seven-year note  decreased three basis
points to 1.07 percent and reached 1.05 percent, the lowest
since Aug. 7.  Treasury  volume  reported by ICAP Plc, the largest inter-
dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , rose to $252 billion
today, after dropping to $110 billion on Aug. 27, the lowest
this year. It has averaged $238 billion in 2012.  Treasuries have lost 0.6 percent in August, paring their
advance for the year to 2.1 percent, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch bond indexes show. They returned 9.8 percent in 2011.  Demand at the government’s auctions of $99 billion in two-,
five- and seven-year notes this week rose from last month’s
offerings of the same amounts of the three maturities. The
average bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of demand that compares the
amount bid with the amount offered, was 3.22 at this week’s
sales. The average ratio at the July offerings, when each note
drew a record low sale yield, was 3.12.  Today’s sale of $29 billion in seven-year notes had a  bid-
to-cover  ratio of 2.8 percent, versus an average of 2.79 at the
past 10 offerings. The ratio at the July sale of the securities
was 2.64 percent. Seven-year note yields reached a record
auction low of 0.954 percent at the July sale.  Auction Bidders  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 38.4 percent of the notes sold today,
the least since April, compared with an average of 40.1 percent
at the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders , non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 17.9 percent, the
most since February. The average at the previous 10 sales was
13.5 percent.  “It was a good auction,” said  Michael Franzese , managing
director and head of Treasury trading at Wunderlich Securities
Inc. in New York. “People need paper. Bernanke is going to say
he’s prepared to do what’s necessary to prevent the economy from
decelerating.”  The U.S. sold $35 billion of two-year notes on Aug. 28 at a
yield of 0.273 percent and the same amount of five-year notes
yesterday at a yield of 0.708 percent.  Fed Purchase  The Fed bought $1.8 billion of Treasuries today due from
February 2036 to May 2042. The central bank is in the process of
swapping shorter-term Treasuries in its holdings with those due
in six to 30 years to put downward pressure on long-term
 interest rates . Traders call the effort Operation Twist after a
similar program in the 1960s.  Bernanke will address the Kansas City Fed’s annual
economic-policy conference in Jackson Hole tomorrow. Many policy
makers at the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s last meeting said
additional stimulus probably will be needed soon unless the
economy shows signs of a durable pickup, according to minutes of
the July 31-Aug. 1 policy discussions.  The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of assets in two
rounds of the stimulus strategy called quantitative easing from
2008 to 2011.  A gauge of prices tied to  consumer spending  advanced 1.3
percent in the 12 months ended in July, the smallest gain since
October 2009 and below the Fed’s long-run goal of 2 percent,
Commerce Department data showed today. Excluding food and energy
costs, the measure increased 1.6 percent in the past year.  ‘Another Justification’  Bill Gross , co-chief investment officer and founder of
 Newport Beach , California-based Pacific Investment Management
Co., manager of the world’s biggest bond fund, said in a Twitter
post today the data add to the potential for more stimulus.  The core PCE inflation number of 1.6 percent is “another
justification for QE3,” Gross wrote. “Bernanke stresses dual
mandate and 2 percent target rate.” The Fed’s two objectives
are maximum employment and price stability.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and similar-
maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities narrowed to
2.27 percent today, after reaching a four-month high of 2.35
percent yesterday. The spread, called the break-even rate, shows
the expected rate of price gains for the life of the debt.  Spanish Bailout  U.S. government securities extended gains earlier as the
euro erased an advance versus the dollar after Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  said  Spain  will delay deciding whether to seek a
bailout until aid terms are clear. The shared currency weakened
0.2 percent to $1.2506 after rising 0.3 percent earlier. Stocks
fell, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index losing 0.8 percent.  Treasuries were at the most expensive level in three weeks,
according to the 10-year  term premium , a model created by
economists at the Fed that includes expectations for interest
rates, growth and inflation. The gauge was at negative 0.89
percent today, the most costly since Aug. 6. A negative reading
indicates investors are willing to accept yields below what’s
considered fair value.  To contact the reporters on this story:
