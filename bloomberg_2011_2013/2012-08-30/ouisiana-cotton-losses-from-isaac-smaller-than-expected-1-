Cotton farmers in  Louisiana  will
have smaller cotton losses than expected from Tropical Storm
Isaac because most crops weren’t ready for harvesting, limiting
damage, a growers’ group said.  “Winds from Isaac defoliated some plants, and very few
isolated farms will lose 15 percent to 20 percent of yields,”
Meredith Allen, the chief executive officer at Staple Cotton
Cooperative Association, said today in a telephone interview,
citing discussions with Louisiana growers.  “In the big picture, this means a lot less damage than we
feared two days ago,” Allen said from Greenwood,  Mississippi .
“Most of the losses will occur at farms where cotton areas were
ready to be harvested, but fortunately, most of them were not,”
he said.  Isaac made landfall as a hurricane on Aug. 28. It has been
downgraded to a tropical storm and was 125 miles (201
kilometers) northwest of  New Orleans  at 8 a.m. New York time,
the National Hurricane Center said. The storm was forecast to
weaken to a tropical depression by tonight and move to Arkansas
tomorrow, the center said.  “We still have about 36 hours of rain because the storm is
moving very slowly,” Allen said.  The cooperative represents 4,000 growers in 11 southern
states.  In the year started Aug. 1,  Louisiana  may produce 400,000
bales, or 2.3 percent of U.S. output estimated at 17.65 million
bales, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed on Aug. 10.  Cotton futures for December delivery rose 0.4 percent to
76.96 cents a pound at 2:24 p.m. on ICE Futures in  New York .
Through yesterday, the price dropped 17 percent this year.  A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms,  To contact the reporter on this story:
