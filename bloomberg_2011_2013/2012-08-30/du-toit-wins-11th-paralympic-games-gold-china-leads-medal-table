South African swimmer Natalie du Toit won her 11th gold medal and British cyclist Sarah Storey
her eighth on day one of the London  Paralympic Games .  Chinese athletes broke world records in shooting, swimming
and cycling yesterday to lead the medals table.  Du Toit, 28, won the women’s 100 meters butterfly in the S9
category, while Storey, 33, took the women’s individual C5
pursuit. Storey has won five gold medals in swimming and three
in cycling since switching sports.  China leads  the medal count  with six golds and 15 overall.
 Australia  is next with three golds and nine in total. Britain,
Urkaine, Germany and  Russia  have two golds each.  The games run through Sept. 9, with more than 4,000
athletes from 164 teams participating. Athletes compete in
classes depending on their impairment, with a higher number
typically signaling a lesser impediment.  Jonathan Fox won Britain’s other gold in the 100 meters
backstroke S7. Russians Sergey Punko and Oxana Savchenko won the
men and women’s 400 meters freestyle S12, a category for the
visually impaired.  China ’s Zhang Cuiping claimed the first gold of the games
in the women’s R2-10 meter air rifle standing SH1 event with a
record total of 500.9. Athletes in the class can support the
weight of their firearm themselves.  In other Chinese world records, Zheng Tao won the men’s 100
meters backstroke S6 in 1 minute, 13.56 seconds. Lu Dong won the
women’s event in 1:24:71, and Zeng Sini set a new mark on the
way to winning the women’s cycling pursuit C1-2-3.  Australians Susan Powell and Kieran Modra broke world
records en route to winning the women’s C4 pursuit title and the
