Facebook Inc. (FB)  may post $5.04 billion
in sales this year,  EMarketer Inc.  estimated, down from the
market researcher’s earlier projection for $6.1 billion as the
biggest social network struggles to sustain advertising growth.  EMarketer, which made its earlier prediction in  February ,
now expects revenue to rise 36 percent in 2012 and 31 percent in
2013, compared with an 88 percent gain last year. Growth in
advertising, which makes up the majority of Facebook’s sales,
will slow to 34 percent in 2012 and 29 percent in 2013, from
more than 68 percent last year, New York-based EMarketer said.  Facebook is grappling with questions from marketers about
how well ads on its site are performing, said Debra Aho Williamson, an EMarketer analyst. While Facebook says it is
working with companies to show that the ads have an impact with
its 955 million users, the social network must move more
quickly, she said.  Sales “haven’t been growing as fast as we and others had
expected,” Williamson said. “There is still hesitation about
the effectiveness of the advertising, about how much the
advertising is worth.”  Still, revenue growth is seen “stabilizing” in 2013, she
said. The company will get help next year from newer
initiatives, including ads tied to searches and the Facebook
Exchange, which lets advertisers reach specific types of users
on the site based on their browsing history.  New mobile-ad services also should make a bigger impact
next year as well, she said. These services weren’t a big part
of the forecast for 2012.  Targeting Tool  Facebook is unveiling a new tool for marketers next week,
said Elisabeth Diana, a spokeswoman for Facebook. The service
will let advertisers use data they’ve collected from their own
customers, such as e-mails and phone numbers, to target those
users on Facebook, using a software tool that is designed to
protect the members’ identities.  The company’s stock has lost half its value since Facebook
sold shares at $38 apiece in an initial public offering on May
17. Facebook, based in  Menlo Park ,  California , fell 1 cent to
$19.09 at the close in  New York .  The reduced sales projection for 2012 brings EMarketer’s
estimates to 2.4 percent more than the $4.92 billion average
prediction of Wall Street analysts, according to data compiled
by  Bloomberg. (B)  EMarketer’s February estimate was 24 percent
higher than the current average projection.  Last month, Facebook reported sales growth of 32 percent in
the second quarter, down from 45 percent in the first quarter
and 55 percent in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
