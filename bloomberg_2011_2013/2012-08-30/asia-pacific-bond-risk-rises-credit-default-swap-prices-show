The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
outside of Japan rose, according to credit-default swap traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan advanced 1 basis point to 151.5 basis
points as of 8:39 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge is poised for its highest close
since Aug. 3 and has traded between 145.8 and 159.8 basis points
this month, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index climbed 1 basis point to
161 as of 10:14 a.m. in Sydney,  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) 
prices show. The benchmark, which has traded between 148.3 basis
points and 168.2 basis points this month, is on track for its
seventh-consecutive daily increase, according to CMA, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 0.5 of a basis point to
201 basis points as of 9:34 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The measure was up 17 basis points this month yesterday,
CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
