The European Commission will propose
that a plan to hand supervisory powers to the  European Central
Bank  should be phased in gradually, beginning with banks
stabilized by the euro area’s rescue funds.  Under the proposal, which will be released on Sept. 12, the
ECB would oversee rescued lenders starting on Jan. 1, 2013, said
Stefaan De Rynck, a spokesman for  Michel Barnier , the EU’s
financial services chief.  The central bank’s supervisory role would be extended on
July 1 of next year to all so-called systemically important
banks in the 17-nation euro area, De Rynck said, confirming
details given by Barnier in an interview with  Sueddeutsche
Zeitung .  The final stage would begin on Jan. 1, 2014, when the ECB
would start supervising all euro-area banks, De Rynck said. The
central bank would delegate day-to-day oversight for most banks
to national regulators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
