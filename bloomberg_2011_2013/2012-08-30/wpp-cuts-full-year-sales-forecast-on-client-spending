WPP Plc (WPP) , the world’s biggest
advertising agency, cut its full-year sales growth forecast as
clients in  North America  and continental  Europe  reduced
spending. The stock dropped the most since October 2011.  Sales excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency
fluctuations will grow “close to 3.5 percent” this year versus
an earlier forecast of 4 percent, the owner of the  Ogilvy &
Mather  and  Grey Group  ad agencies said in a statement today.  Chief Executive Officer  Martin Sorrell  has been acquiring
digital advertising assets and companies in developing markets
such as  China  and  Brazil  to make up for effects of the  European
debt crisis . Revenue in Western Europe dropped 3 percent in the
second quarter. The Dublin-based company said 2013 would be
“more challenging” in the absence of a major event such as the
Olympics or U.S. Presidential election to boost spending.  “We’re in a difficult client spending environment,”  Will Smith , an analyst at Jefferies in London, said in an interview.
“They’ve turned many acquisitions but it shows the industry is
having a difficult time finding growth.”  WPP declined as much as 5.1 percent to 789.5 pence and was
down 4.6 percent as of 8:19 a.m. Before today, the stock had
risen 23 percent this year, while Britain’s FTSE 100 benchmark
index gained 3.1 percent.  Organic sales rose 3.6 percent in the first half while
Smith had forecast 4 percent. Total sales increased 5.5 percent
to 4.97 billion pounds ($7.9 billion), compared with an analyst
forecast for 5 billion pounds in a Bloomberg survey.  ‘Bit Cautious’  “We’re seeing pretty much the same as we saw in 2011, but
the growth rate is slightly less,” Sorrell said in an interview
with Bloomberg Television today. “2013 we are a bit cautious
about with no quadrennial events but 2014 should be better.”  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose 10 percent to 682 million pounds in the first
half. WPP said billings in the period totalled 21.7 billion
pounds, an increase of 1.2 percent. The company increased its
first-half dividend by 18 percent to 8.80 pence a share.  Sorrell said in March he planned to spent 300 million to
400 million pounds on acquisitions this year. WPP last year
bought almost three dozen companies or units and in the first
half of this year made 40 acquisitions, the company said today.  WPP advertising researcher GroupM last month cut its
forecast for worldwide ad growth in 2012 to 5.1 percent from 6.3
percent, citing a decline in ad investment of 8.8 percent in
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Ad spending in the
U.S. is predicted to grow 3.6 percent, from a 4 percent forecast
late last year, the researcher said at the time.  WPP’s French rival  Publicis Groupe SA (PUB)  said in July its
organic revenue rose 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
