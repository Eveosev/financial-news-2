Twitter Inc., the microblogging
service whose members can send 140-character messages to
followers online, unveiled a service that lets advertisers
target users based on their interests.  The new service will let marketers send Promoted Tweets and
list Promoted Accounts to sets of users based on interest
categories the advertisers can select, the San Francisco-based
company said today in a blog posting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
