National Intelligence Director  James Clapper  selected Peter Highnam as the second director of the
Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity.  Highnam, a former senior adviser to the  National Institutes
of Health , has been serving as acting director of the
intelligence research agency since the departure of its first
director, Lisa Porter, in May, according to  a statement  today
from the director’s office.  The research agency, a center within the Office of the
Director of National Intelligence, invests in “high-risk, high-
payoff research programs” designed to give the U.S. “an
overwhelming intelligence advantage over future adversaries,”
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
