Avangardco Investments Public Ltd. (AVGR) ,
a Ukrainian egg producer, said its profit rose 46 percent in the
first half of the year on higher sales and better prices.  Net income rose to $97.6 million in the six months ending
June 30 compared with $67 million a year earlier, the company,
which is based in capital Kiev, said in an e-mailed statement
today. Sales of eggs increased 13 percent to 2.41 billion units,
the company said.  “Demand for our product continued to increase,” said
Chief Executive Officer Nataliya Vasylyuk in the statement.
“The company was able to significantly increase its exports to
the  Middle East , North Africa and  Asia  as well as to increase
sales of its products to the domestic market.”  The company, which raised $187.5 million by selling a 20
percent stake in a London initial share sale in 2010, wants to
start exporting poultry products to the European Union.
