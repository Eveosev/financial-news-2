ThyssenKrupp Nirosta GmbH will
shorten working hours at its Bochum plant in  Germany  from
September because of weak orders.  “ThyssenKrupp Nirosta expects short-time working to be
used only as a short-term measure” agreed with the works
council, the company said today in a statement.  Monica Soffritti, a spokeswoman for the company, declined
to give a more precise period or the amount by which production
will be reduced when contacted by phone. About 456 employees, or
11 percent of the unit’s staff, are affected.  ThyssenKrupp Nirosta is part of ThyssenKrupp’s Inoxum Group
which  Outokumpu Oyj (OUT1V) , a Finish maker of stainless steel, agreed
to buy on Jan. 31 in a deal valuing the German unit at about 2.7
billion euros ($3.4 billion). The Espoo, Finland-based company
said last week that it received a European Union antitrust
complaint, a so-called statement of objections, over the plan to
create  Europe ’s largest maker of the alloy.  ThyssenKrupp, which would retain a 29.9 percent stake in
the business, still expects to close the deal by the end of
2012.  The group’s ThyssenKrupp Steel Europe AG unit introduced
shortened shifts in August due to weak orders. The measure
affected production sites in Duisburg-Hamborn, Duisburg-
Huettenheim, Bochum, Dortmund and the Siegerland area.  Reduced shifts for the unit are expected to remain in place
until the end of the year, ThyssenKrupp said last month. About
12 percent of 17,500 workers are affected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
