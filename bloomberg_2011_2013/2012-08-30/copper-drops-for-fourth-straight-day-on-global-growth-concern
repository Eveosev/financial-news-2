Copper rose for the first time in
four days after Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said the country will
continue investing in the European  bond market . Tin fell to the
lowest level in a week.  Three-month copper climbed as much as 0.9 percent to $7,640
a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange after dropping 0.5
percent. The contract traded at $7,612.25 by 3:14 p.m. Shanghai
time, and has added 0.7 percent this month.  Wen said he was more confident about the euro area after
meeting German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  today. China is willing
to continue investing on condition of fully evaluating the risks,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported. The dollar index fell
0.2 percent, while the euro rose.  “Wen’s comments highlighted China’s commitments to
cooperate with the region, weighing down the dollar and boosting
market sentiment,” said Jia Zheng, a trader at East Asia
Futures Co.  The December-delivery contract on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange closed 0.9 percent higher at 55,680  yuan  ($8,767) a ton,
while Comex futures rose 0.6 percent to $3.4685 a pound.  Pacific Investment Management Co.’s  Bill Gross  said the
Federal Reserve will add to monetary stimulus even if Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke fails to indicate additional measures during a
speech in two days. Bernanke will speak to central bankers
tomorrow in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming.  Copper consumption in China is expected to expand 5 percent
this year, the slowest rate since 1997, according to Yang Changhua, an analyst at Beijing Antaike Information Development
Co. “We’re not optimistic about next year,” Yang said.  Tin fell as much as 2.4 percent to $19,150 a ton in London,
the lowest level in a week. The metal tumbled 5.2 percent
yesterday after PT Timah said that it was resuming spot sales.
Zinc and nickel rose in  London , while lead declined. Aluminum
was little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
