Moody’s Investors Service said its
review of  Spain ’s debt rating for a possible downgrade will
likely continue through September.  The review, which started June 13, is dependent on the
scope of the nation’s bank recapitalization, support available
under the European Stability Mechanism and potential changes to
the region’s existing crisis-management framework, the New York
based ratings firm said in a statement today. Moody’s reduced
Spain to its lowest level of investment grade on June 13,
cutting it three steps to Baa3 from A3.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  delayed seeking a second
rescue for Spain while pledging to continue bailing out its
regions as Valencia requested more money to settle bills and
cover debt.  Rajoy spoke today following a meeting in Madrid with French
President  Francois Hollande . Catalonia, Valencia and Murcia this
week claimed more than half of an 18 billion-euro ($23 billion)
fund announced by Rajoy last month to help the regions face bond
redemptions and finance their deficits in the second half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
