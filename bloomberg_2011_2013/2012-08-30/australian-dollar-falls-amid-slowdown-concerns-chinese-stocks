The Australian dollar fell to the
weakest level in more than a month against its U.S. peer after
the nation’s home-building permits fell by the most in a decade.  The Aussie declined to a nearly two-month low against the
euro as  China ’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slipped to its lowest
level since February 2009. China is the nation’s largest trading
partner. New Zealand’s dollar weakened versus 13 of its 16 most-
traded counterparts as global stocks and commodities dropped.  “We continue to hold some Australian dollars, but it’s
certainly not as attractively priced since there are more
headwinds now,”  Axel Merk , founder and president of Merk
Investments LLC in  Palo Alto , California, said on a radio
interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt. “We tend to be more positive on the China story that
is very closely linked to Australia. But, by all means, there is
some slowing down happening in Australia.”  The Aussie fell 0.6 percent to $1.0289 yesterday in New
York, touching $1.0277, the lowest since July 25. It fetched
A$1.21548 per euro, after reaching A$1.21621, the weakest since
July 5. It declined 0.7 percent to 80.90 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, known as the kiwi, fell 0.3 percent
to 79.81 U.S. cents and slumped 0.4 percent to 62.75 yen.  The  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of stocks fell 0.9 percent and the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials tumbled 0.3
percent.  The number of permits granted to build or renovate houses
and apartments slumped 17.3 percent from June, when they fell a
revised 1 percent, the Bureau of Statistics said in Sydney
yesterday. That was the steepest slide since November 2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
