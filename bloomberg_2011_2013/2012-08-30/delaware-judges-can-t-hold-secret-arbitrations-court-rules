Delaware Chancery Court judges
sitting as arbitrators must hold public hearings and can’t
exclude the public and news media, a federal judge decided.  The decision, by U.S. District Judge Mary A. McLaughlin in
Philadelphia, came in a case brought last year by the Delaware
Coalition for Open Government against chief Delaware Chancery
Court Judge Leo Strine and his four associates over a new
practice of designating a judge as an arbitrator before closing
the courtroom.  “An arbitrator and a judge perform very different
functions,” McLaughlin decided in a 26-page opinion today.
“The First Amendment protects a qualified right of access to
criminal and civil trials.”  Strine’s office referred calls to Mike Barlow, chief legal
counsel for Delaware Governor Jack Markell.  Barlow didn’t
immediately return a request for comment on the ruling.  David Finger, the attorney who filed the case, said the
ruling will strengthen the courts and improve the economy of
private arbitration using lawyers and retired judges who are
experts in Delaware law.  “I always thought this was a no-brainer,” he said.  The case is Delaware Coalition for Open Government Inc. v.
Strine, 11-cv-1015, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
