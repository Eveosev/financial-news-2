The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable Internet links.  Remy Fight  Chelsea and Tottenham are competing to sign French striker
Loic Remy from Marseille, which is demanding about 15 million
pounds ($24 million),  the  Daily Express  said.  Tottenham was interested in Willian, a Shakhtar Donestsk
striker, but isn’t willing to pay the 20 million pounds his
current club is demanding, the newspaper said. Chelsea owner
 Roman Abramovich  has declined to make bids for Porto’s Hulk and
Napoli’s Edin Cavani because of the cost, and the Blues are
considering a move for Remy instead, the newspaper said.  Maicon Move?  Manchester City is considering a bid for Inter Milan
defender Maicon, who might be available for 6 million pounds,
 the Guardian said.   The 31-year-old, who played for City coach  Roberto Mancini 
for two years, has one year remaining on his contract and would
compete for a spot with  Pablo Zabaleta , the newspaper said.
Micah Richards is out of favor with Mancini, the Guardian said.  Carroll Replacement?  Liverpool will try to sell striker Andy Carroll to fund a
bid for Athletic Bilbao’s  Fernando Llorente ,  the Sun said.   The 27-year-old Llorente has refused to extend his
contract, which expires after the season, and has been forced to
train with the reserves, the newspaper said.  Swansea’s Spaniard  Swansea is paying 5.5 million pounds for Valencia winger
Pablo Hernandez,  the Mirror said.   Coach Michael Laudrup had two bids rejected before getting
the player, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
