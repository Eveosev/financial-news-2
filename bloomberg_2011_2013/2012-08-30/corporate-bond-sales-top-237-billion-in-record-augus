Sales of corporate bonds globally
surged to the most on record for August as issuers rushed to
lock in record-low borrowing costs.  Siemens AG (SIE) , Europe’s largest engineering company, and
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  led borrowers selling $237.6 billion of
debt this month, exceeding the $235.3 billion raised in August
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields fell to an
unprecedented low of 3.72 percent on Aug. 28, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch index data.  Offerings are increasing as issuers take advantage of
demand with default rates below historic averages and optimism
rising that Europe’s leaders may contain the region’s fiscal
strains. While yields on corporate bonds average less than 4
percent, the spread to U.S. Treasuries is higher than before the
credit crisis. Government bond yields have been suppressed by
central banks easing monetary policy to stimulate growth.  Sales in the U.S. reached $94.6 billion, split between
$63.9 billion in investment-grade debt and $30.7 billion in
high-yield, while issuance in  Europe  totaled 33.6 billion euros
($42 billion), Bloomberg data show.  Siemens sold $3.3 billion of bonds denominated in pounds
and euros yesterday in Europe’s biggest corporate fundraising
since May, the data show. The Munich-based company’s offering
included 350 million pounds ($553 million) of 2.75 percent, 13-
year debt and 650 million pounds of 3.75 percent, 30-year
securities, Bloomberg data show.  JPMorgan sold $2.5 billion of 2 percent, five-year bonds on
Aug. 13 and $1.1 billion of 5.5 percent, perpetual preferred
shares on Aug. 20, Bloomberg data show. The New York-based
bank’s offering of shares, rated the highest level of
speculative grade at Ba1 by Moody’s Investors Service, was
increased from an initial $500 million amid demand from
investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
