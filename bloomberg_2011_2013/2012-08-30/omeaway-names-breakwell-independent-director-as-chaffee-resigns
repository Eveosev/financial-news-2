HomeAway Inc. (AWAY) , an online vacation-
rental service, has named Simon Breakwell, a former director at
travel website  Expedia Inc. (EXPE) , to its board.  He will serve as an independent director and as a member of
HomeAway’s audit committee, replacing Todd Chaffee, who resigned
from the board, the Austin, Texas-based company said today in a
regulatory filing.  Breakwell, previously president of Expedia’s international
business, joins the board as HomeAway is expanding outside the
U.S. and adding travel services to its mainstay business helping
users rent vacation properties. HomeAway in June said it will
offer airline tickets and rental cars through a partnership with
online travel agency  Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN)   Chaffee is a partner at Institutional Venture Partners, an
early investor in HomeAway. The fund participated in a $250
million financing round in 2008 that was led by Technology
Crossover Ventures and included Redpoint Ventures. Institutional
Venture has also backed Twitter Inc., operator of a micro-
blogging service, and LivingSocial, a daily-deal website.  HomeAway raised $216 million in an initial public offering
in June 2011, selling 8 million shares at $27 apiece. The stock
has lost 13 percent since the IPO. The shares gained less than 1
percent to $23.60 at the close in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
