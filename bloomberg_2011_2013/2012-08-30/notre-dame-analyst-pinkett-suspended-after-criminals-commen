University of  Notre Dame  football
radio analyst Allen Pinkett was suspended for at least the
season opener after he said the team needs “criminals” to win.  Don Criqui and Jeff Jeffers will handle the broadcast,
according to a statement from IMG. The Fighting Irish open the
season against the U.S. Naval Academy in Dublin, Ireland, on
Sept. 1  “The event deserves to be free of distraction,” Andrew
Giangola, an IMG Notre Dame Radio Network spokesman, said in the
statement.  Further decisions on Pinkett, a two-time All-American
running back at Notre Dame in the 1980s, will be made at a later
date, according to the statement, which didn’t give details.  Pinkett said during a radio interview this week that
successful teams need a few bad citizens. He spoke after Notre
Dame suspended two players, including leading rusher Cierre
Wood, for two games for violating team rules.  “I mean, that’s how Ohio State used to win all the time,”
he said. “They would have two or three guys that were
criminals. That just adds to the chemistry of the team. I think
Notre Dame is growing because maybe they have some guys that are
doing something worthy of a suspension, which creates edge on
the football team. You can’t have a football team full of choir
boys.”  Notre Dame Athletic Director Jack Swarbrick called the
remarks “nonsense.”  “Of course, Allen does not speak for the university, but
we could not disagree more with his observation,” Swarbrick
said.  Notre Dame was 8-5 last season.  Bloomberg Radio  is the broadcast home for Notre Dame
