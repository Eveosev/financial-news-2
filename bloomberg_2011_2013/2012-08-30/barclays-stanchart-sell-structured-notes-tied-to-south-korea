Barclays Plc (BARC)  and  Standard Chartered
Plc (STAN)  sold about $300 million of structured notes tied to the debt
of  South Korea  after the nation had its rating raised on par
with Japan and China by Moody’s Investors Service.  Barclays, the U.K.’s second-biggest lender by assets,
issued two 10-year $100 million credit-linked notes Aug. 28 that
pay an annual coupon of 4.65 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Standard Chartered also sold two 10-year notes,
one for $52.78 million and another for $39.96 million.  Moody’s upgraded South Korea by one step on Aug. 27 to Aa3
citing strong “fiscal fundamentals” that have strengthened
Asia’s fourth-largest economy’s resilience to domestic and
external crises.  Jodie Gray, a spokeswoman for Barclays in London declined
to comment on the bank’s issues. Jong Sun Kim, a Seoul-based
spokesman at  Standard Chartered , said the notes were issued from
its branch in Singapore and were not predicated on South Korea’s
upgrade.  Credit-linked notes, which are debt securities with
embedded derivatives, offer higher yields and maturities that
may not be available in the bond market. Investors suffer losses
if there’s a default for either the bank issuing the note or the
reference entity.  Banks sold $589.74 million of notes tied to South Korea’s
debt this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Russian
government bonds are the most in demand for structured notes
with sales tied to the debt of the world’s biggest energy
exporter totaling $1.18 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
