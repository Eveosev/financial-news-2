E*Trade Financial Corp. (ETFC)  agreed to
pay $100,000 and implement an antitrust compliance policy and
training program under a deal with states investigating the
retail securities brokerage industry.  E*Trade also agreed to cooperate with the probe of possibly
collusive conduct by several retail securities brokers and firms
that assist brokers executing orders,  Connecticut  Attorney
General George Jepsen said today in a statement.  The agreement was reached with Connecticut, Missouri and
Iowa, according to letters to the companies from Connecticut
describing the deal. TradeKing Group Inc. also reached a deal
with the states and agreed to pay $100,000, Jepsen said today.
TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. and Scottrade Inc. previously
reached deals in the investigation.  Robert Horton, a spokesman for New York-based E*Trade,
declined to comment on the agreement. Kathy Wilson, a
spokeswoman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based TradeKing, said
in an e-mail that the company had nothing further to add to
Jepsen’s statement.  Neither company made an admission of wrongdoing, according
to the letters, which were posted on the Connecticut attorney
general’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
