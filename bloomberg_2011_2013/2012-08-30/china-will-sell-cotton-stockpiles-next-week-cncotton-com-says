China  will start selling cotton
stockpiles next week to increase local supply, industry website
cncotton.com said today.  The country will sell reserves in auctions to be held as
early as next week at a minimum of 18,500 yuan ($2,913) a metric
ton, the website said, without citing anyone or giving the
amount the government intends to unload.  China’s textile industry, the world’s largest user of the
fiber, has been hurt by weak demand as  economic growth  slowed to
the lowest in more than three years in the second quarter, Zhang
Zhenguo, founder of  Shanghai  Goldencot Global Trading Co., said
from Shanghai today. The industry faces high raw-material costs
because China’s cotton is traded at a steep premium to the
overseas market, he said.  “China’s cotton prices may stabilize as long as there’s no
bad news on the macro-side of the economy,” Zhang said.  Cotton for January delivery traded on the Zhengzhou
Commodity Exchange gained 0.4 percent to close at 19,540  yuan  a
ton and have climbed 2.8 percent this month. Cotton in  New York 
climbed 0.5 percent to 77.05 cents per pound at 3:54 p.m. in
Beijing.  China’s cotton-reserve policy will probably determine
prices in the near term, Morgan Stanley said in a report dated
Aug. 28.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
