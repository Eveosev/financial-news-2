A Secret Service agent accidentally
left a loaded gun in the bathroom of  Mitt Romney ’s campaign
plane today.  The weapon was discovered by a CBS News reporter on the
flight between Tampa and Indianapolis, where Romney delivered a
speech to the  American Legion .  The agent retrieved the gun without incident, and Romney
never appeared to be in any danger.  Secret Service agents on the flight referred questions
about the incident to the public affairs office.  The agent remained in Indianapolis to deal with the matter.
The Romney campaign had no comment on the issue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
