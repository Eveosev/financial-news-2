European Central Bank Executive
Board member Joerg Asmussen said the  International Monetary Fund 
should be involved in setting conditions for countries applying
for bond-buying aid from Europe’s bailout fund.  “In my opinion, the IMF will be also involved in the
design of the economic adjustment process,” Asmussen said
during a speech yesterday in Potsdam,  Germany . “As an external
policeman, the IMF has a lot of leverage.”  The Frankfurt-based ECB is working to design a bond-buying
plan that will help countries lower their borrowing costs if
they accept economic-reform conditions and Europe’s bailout
fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, buys their debt
on the primary market. Three Spanish regions including Catalonia
this week claimed more than half of an 18 billion-euro ($23
billion) domestic rescue fund, increasing pressure on Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy  to seek external aid.  “The ECB can only act in parallel with the EFSF,”
Asmussen said. “In my opinion, this means states should apply
for primary bond-market intervention from the EFSF before the
ECB can intervene.”  Spain and Italy, the countries currently most vulnerable to
contagion from the crisis that began in  Greece  almost three
years ago, have yet to decide whether to seek help.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  may announce details of the
program, which faces resistance from Germany’s Bundesbank, when
the ECB’s Governing Council meets on Sept. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
