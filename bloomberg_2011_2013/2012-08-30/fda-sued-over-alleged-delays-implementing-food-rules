The U.S.  Food and Drug
Administration  was sued over claims that it has failed to enact
regulations intended to help prevent outbreaks of food-borne
illnesses 18 months after a safety law was signed.  The government missed a January deadline for setting
standards for the safe production and harvesting of fruits and
vegetables and was supposed to establish regulations requiring
food shippers to use sanitary practices by July, lawyers for the
Center for  Food Safety  and the Center for  Environmental Health 
said in a complaint filed yesterday in federal court in San
Francisco.  The groups’ lawsuit claims the government has failed to
promulgate seven major food safety regulations required by the
Food Safety and Modernization Act, signed into law by President
 Barack Obama  in January 2011.  The act is supposed to better protect public health,
including guarding against outbreaks of illnesses by
strengthening the food safety system, lawyers for the groups
said in the complaint. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention estimate that every year, as a result of food-borne
diseases, 48 million people -- one in six Americans -- get sick,
128,000 are hospitalized and 3,000 die, according to the
complaint.  The lawsuit seeks a court order requiring the FDA to
implement the regulations. Curtis Allen, an FDA spokesman, said
in an e-mail that the agency can’t comment on pending
litigation.  The case is Center for Food Safety v. Hamburg, 12-4529,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of  California  (San
Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
