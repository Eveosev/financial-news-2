Ethanol futures fell in  Chicago ,
heading for the first monthly drop since May, after a government
report showed ample supply of the biofuel.  Futures declined after an Energy Department report
yesterday showed that the industry’s 15 percent  production  cut
to 819,000 barrels a day from a record 963,000 on Dec. 30 hasn’t
been enough to trim supply. Stockpiles at 18.5 million barrels
last week, little changed from the previous week, were 3.4
percent higher than a year earlier.  “Production’s certainly slowed, but it’s not enough,”
said  Jason Ward , an analyst at Northstar Commodity Investments
in  Minneapolis .  Denatured ethanol for September delivery fell 1.9 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $2.587 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The futures have dropped 1.6 percent this month.  Prices have also been pressured by imports, said Mike Breitenbach, an analyst and trader at Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC
in  New York .  The U.S.  imported  22,000 barrels of ethanol a day in the
week ended Aug. 24, the Energy Department said yesterday,
compared to none a year earlier.  In cash market trading, ethanol increased 2.5 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.635 a gallon in the Gulf and gained 1.5 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $2.655 in New York, data compiled by Bloomberg
shows. Ethanol in Chicago rose 1 cent to $2.58 a gallon and on
the West Coast, the biofuel jumped 0.5 cent to $2.725.  Corn Prices  Corn for December delivery dropped 5 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $8.085 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel of corn makes at least
2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Gasoline for September delivery slid 1.77 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $3.0826 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices have gained 15 percent this year.  Refiners, required by the U.S. to blend about 13.2 billion
gallons of ethanol into gasoline this year, may use more than
the government requires as they stand to pocket the difference
between the two fuels.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
RINs, tumbled 17 percent to 2.95 cents, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. They are credits that help the government track
whether refiners are meeting 2012 federal ethanol use mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
