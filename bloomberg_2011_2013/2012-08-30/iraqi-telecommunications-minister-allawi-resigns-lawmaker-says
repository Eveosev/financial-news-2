Iraqi Telecommunications Minister
Mohammad Tawfeeq Allawi resigned to protest “interferences” by
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, according to Qusay al-Ibadi, a
lawmaker from Allawi’s al-Iraqiya parliamentary bloc.  Maliki has accepted the minister’s resignation, Ali al-
Musawi, a spokesman accompanying the Iraqi prime minister to the
Non-Aligned Movement summit in Tehran, said by phone from the
Iranian capital today. Musawi declined to comment on the reasons
for the resignation. Allawi’s mobile phone was turned off.  The Sunni Muslim-backed al-Iraqiya coalition headed by  Ayad Allawi  boycotted parliament and Cabinet sessions for weeks
earlier this year to press demands for more power-sharing with
the Shiite Muslim prime minister’s alliance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
