Kenya ’s shilling weakened for a
fourth day as investors await inflation data that will influence
the central bank’s review of  interest rates  next week.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy depreciated
0.2 percent to 84.40 a dollar by 4:56 p.m. in Nairobi, Kenya’s
capital, set for the lowest since June 15.  “Investors are looking for the inflation data,” Peter
Mutuku, a trader with Bank of Africa Ltd., said by phone from
Nairobi. “If it goes down there will be pressure to cut
rates.”  The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics releases  inflation 
data by end of every month. Inflation slowed for an eight month
in July, with the rate declining to 7.7 percent from 10.1
percent in June. The central bank is due to review policy on
Sept. 5. Monetary policy makers last met in July when they cut
the key lending rate for the first time in 18 months, lowering
it 1.5 percentage points to 16.5 percent.  Uganda ’s shilling declined for the first time in five days,
falling 0.1 percent to 2,497.50 a dollar. The Tanzanian currency
dropped 0.5 percent to 1,578.50, set for its biggest slump since
July 23, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
