Farmers House Plc (FRHS) , a Zambian property
developer, said it plans a “substantial” increase in its
assets during fiscal 2012 and will add at least properties in
the year.  The company wants to take on more debt and will “gear up
to 50 percent” if it could get the loans, Managing Director
Robin Miller said at a conference in Johannesburg today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
