Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ,
the largest publicly traded copper producer, is “selling less”
metal in Europe than a few months ago as U.S. demand is “the
same,” said Javier Targhetta, a senior vice president.  “We’re selling less in Europe,” Targhetta said in an
interview in London today. “We are shifting copper to the
 Middle East  or countries of the Mediterranean” such as Turkey
and Egypt, he said.  Copper has dropped 29 percent this year as mounting concern
about growth eroded expectations for supply shortages. Europe
accounts for about 20 percent of Freeport’s sales, and the U.S.
about 30 percent, according to Targhetta, who is senior vice
president of marketing and sales.  “The  U.S. economy  is slowing down yet our sales remain the
same,” he said. In  China , the biggest consumer of copper,
“demand remains robust,” Targhetta said. Chinese buyers “are
clearly using copper. I haven’t seen a decline in demand.” Asia
makes up 40 percent to 45 percent of the Phoenix-based company’s
sales, he said.  Freeport has seen no changes to its global sales, Targhetta
said. “We are selling what we are producing. There are no
delays, no cancellations. Demand remains very strong.”  Copper in concentrate will continue to show “tightness” as
there is more smelting capacity than mined output, he said.  Targhetta is in London for London Metal Exchange Week, an
annual event during which supply contracts are discussed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
