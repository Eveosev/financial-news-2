Cocoa supplies will match demand in
the current 2011-12 season as production drops in West Africa,
the top global growing region, according to Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.  Output exceeded demand by 325,000 metric tons in the 2010-
11 season that ended last month on record-high production in
 Ivory Coast  and  Ghana , data from the London-based International
Cocoa Organization show. The countries are the world’s two
biggest producers of the chocolate ingredient.  “A return to neutral weather conditions in West Africa
suggests that 2011-12 production will not be as large as the
current crop,” Goldman Sachs analyst Damien Courvalin wrote in
a report today.  Cocoa prices will be at $2,700 a ton in 3, 6 and 12 months,
the bank said, adding that a possible revival of La Nina weather
conditions may benefit crops.  “The potential return of the La Nina weather pattern would
be beneficial to West Africa production and present downside
risk to our forecast,” Courvalin wrote.  La Nina conditions, a cooling of the  Pacific Ocean  that can
cause severe climate fluctuations and affect rain patterns, will
strengthen and persist into the Northern Hemisphere’s 2011-12
winter, the U.S. National Weather Service said last month.  Cocoa for December delivery slid 6 pounds, or 0.4 percent,
to 1,681 pounds ($2,587) a ton by 9:31 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in
 London . Cocoa for December delivery fell $29, or 1.1 percent, to
$2,546 a ton on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
