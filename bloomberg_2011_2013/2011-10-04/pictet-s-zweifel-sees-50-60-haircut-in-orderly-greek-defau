Greece  may impose a loss of between
50 percent and 60 percent on investors as European policy makers
seek to prevent a potential default from infecting other
economies, according to the chief economist at Pictet Asset
Management.  “Greece is bankrupt,” Patrick Zweifel, who helps oversee
$125 billion, said in an interview in  London  today. “The
country will need roughly 10 years to get out of their debt.
History shows we cannot have an orderly default but it is
possible to have one if contagion is avoided.”  The Stoxx 600 Europe Index plunged 17 percent in the three
months through September, the worst quarter since 2008, on
concern that the region’s debt crisis is careening out of
control. European governments today dropped clues that
bondholders may be saddled with bigger losses on Greek debt,
intensifying market jitters that a second aid package designed
to quell the fiscal crisis might unravel.  Finance ministers considered reshaping a July deal on Greek
bonds that foresaw investors contributing 50 billion euros ($66
billion) to a 159 billion-euro rescue. That private sector
involvement, or PSI, includes debt exchanges and rollovers,
targeting bondholder losses of 21 percent.  Policy makers “just can’t postpone decisions anymore,”
Zurich-based Zweifel said. “The  European Central Bank  must make
sure there is no contagion” through a program of bond
purchases, while the European Financial Stability Facility
“will make sure the banks are capitalized.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
