Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS)  plans to
commission a gold-processing facility at its Kibali project in
the Democratic Republic of Congo in the fourth quarter of 2013,
almost two years earlier than originally forecast, Chief
Executive Officer Mark Bristow said today in a statement.  “Since acquiring Kibali almost exactly two years ago,
Randgold has moved rapidly to optimize and advance the project,
which is expected to become one of the largest  gold mines  in
Africa,” Bristow said. “Together with our partners, we are
expecting to invest around $1.4 billion, in addition to the
acquisition costs, in the development of this project.”  Randgold’s partners in the venture are AngloGold Ashanti
Ltd. and a government-run company known as Sokimo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
