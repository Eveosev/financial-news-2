Tennessee, with a 9.7 percent
unemployment rate that tops the national average, will offer its
largest bond sale ever as early as next week to help finance a
plant for German automaker  Volkswagen AG. (VOW)   The $585 million general-obligation offering is to fund
economic development projects for  job creation , Mary-Margaret
Collier, director of the Comptroller’s Division of State and
Local Finance, said in a telephone interview from Nashville.  The proceeds will help build plants for Volkswagen;  Wacker
Chemie AG (WKCMF) , a German chemical company, and Michigan-based Hemlock
Semiconductor Corp., a silicon manufacturer. The state estimates
that the projects could bring as many as 4,600 jobs, with
additional jobs created from ancillary development such as
automobile parts suppliers, Blake Fontenay, a spokesman for
Comptroller Justin P. Wilson, wrote in an e-mail.  The deal includes $106 million of refunding bonds that will
save the state more than $10 million in total interest costs,
Collier said.  Moody’s assigned an Aaa rating to the bond sale, its
highest grade, and gave it a negative outlook because of the
state’s dependency on federal aid.  Tennessee ’s largest borrowing
to date was for $390 million in 2009, according to Fontenay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
