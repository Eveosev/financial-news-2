The  European Central Bank  said euro-
region lenders increased overnight deposits to the highest in
more than a year.  Banks parked 209.3 billion euros ($276.3 billion) at the
Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday, up from 199.6 billion euros.
Thatâ€™s the highest since July 12, 2010. Financial institutions
borrowed 1.3 billion euros at the marginal rate of 2.25 percent,
down from 1.4 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
