U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said the debt crisis in the euro region needed to be resolved
without delay after Foreign Secretary  William Hague  described
the single currency as “a burning building with no exits.”  “We’ve got to put the fire out,” Cameron told BBC Radio
4 today from Manchester, northwest England, where his
Conservative Party is holding its annual conference. He said the
crisis was holding back world growth and urged euro-area leaders
to resolve the Greek crisis, strengthen banks and “scale up”
the region’s rescue fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
