German bund futures may advance to as
high as 139.19 should they break above a key resistance level,
UBS AG said, citing technical indicators.  “Bunds are bullish while they trade above support at
136.91,”  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income technical
strategy at UBS in London, wrote in a research note today. That
level represents the 38 percent Fibonacci retracement of the
recovery from 135.01 on Sept. 1, according to Adcock.  “As long as this remains the case, the expectation is for
limited corrections and further price strength,” he said.  The bund futures contract expiring in December was little
changed at 138.18 as of 10:49 a.m. in London. It reached 138.42
earlier, the highest level since Sept. 23.  “A break above yesterday’s 138.10 failure high is the next
bullish trigger, opening the door to 139.19,” Adcock wrote.
That’s the record high reached on Sept. 23, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  A resistance level is an area on a chart where analysts
anticipate orders to sell a security to be grouped. A support
level is an area where they anticipate buy orders to be
clustered. Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices
rise or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or
low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
