The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development sees a revival in investor interest in  Serbia ,
with agriculture as the main underused industry in the country.  The bank is getting an increasing number of foreign
inquiries about Serbia, including from  France , Austria and
 Germany  and more confidence among Serbian businesses, said
Hildegard Gacek, the EBRD’s top representative in the country.  “There seems to be a better environment as companies are
much less worried, much more positive than they were a year
ago,” she said in an interview at a business gathering in
Belgrade today. “The Serbian potential isn’t used sufficiently,
especially in agribusiness for increasing production, we would
really like to encourage it, it’s a natural tool for export.”  The London-based lender also sees Serbia as a “very well
positioned location” from which business operations can cover
much of the Balkans and as a production point that has free
trade agreements with Russia and  Turkey , and may soon close one
with Kazakhstan, Gacek said.  The EBRD’s lending activity in Serbia may remain close to
last year’s total of 590 million euros ($777.3 million), she
said, “but the atmosphere in the country is starting to become
positive again” as half of this year’s total is envisaged for
the private sector.  To contact the reporter on this story:
