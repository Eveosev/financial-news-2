South Korea ’s won pared losses on
speculation exporters were taking advantage of an earlier drop
to a 14-month low to convert overseas income at a more favorable
 exchange rate .  The won was 1.4 percent lower than its closing price on
Sept. 30 at 1,194.50 against the U.S. currency as of 2:10 p.m.
in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It declined
as much as 2.5 percent to 1,208.25, the weakest level since July
last year. South Korea’s financial markets were shut yesterday
for a holiday.  The currency fell as investors sought safety in the
greenback on concern European officials will fail to stem the
euro-region debt crisis. Greece passed austerity measures
yesterday that will cut its 2012  budget deficit  to 6.8 percent
of gross domestic product, short of the 6.5 percent goal
previously agreed to secure financial aid.  “The won is trimming losses in the afternoon as exporters
sell dollars,” said Lee Jung Ha, a senior currency dealer with
 Korea Development Bank  in Seoul. There’s speculation the
government intervened in the morning as the won weakened below
1,200 per dollar, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
