German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said the 17-nation euro area should have a “capable”
central secretariat.  “For the euro group to be in a position to carry out the
incredible amount of work that it has to do, it’s a central
point of our recommendations that it gets a capable secretariat
responsible for all levels,” Schaeuble told reporters in
Luxembourg today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
