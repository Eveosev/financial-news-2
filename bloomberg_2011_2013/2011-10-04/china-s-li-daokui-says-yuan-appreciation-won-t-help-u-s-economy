Li Daokui , an adviser to the People’s
Bank of  China , spoke at a conference in Santiago, Chile today
about U.S. pressure to allow the yuan to appreciate against the
dollar.  “Many writers in the U.S. are saying that globalization is
creating problems for the U.S. and that the U.S. has to rethink
globalization. The  exchange rate  dispute is only the tip of the
iceberg, and under the iceberg is the huge issue of
globalization.  ‘‘There is no way for the U.S. economy to go back to a
manufacturing base. Manufacturing accounts for less than 10
percent of their employment. Their main employment is from
service and construction. However, American politicians aren’t
doing their homework. They easily blame China and the exchange
rate for their unemployment problem. This is a challenge for us.  ‘‘Even if the currency exchange rate appreciates rapidly it
will not help the  U.S. economy . It only means the U.S. will
import from other countries more, and in a very short time the
U.S. will not have the option from importing from other
countries but from importing from China at higher prices, that
will translate into inflation.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
