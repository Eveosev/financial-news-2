Russia’s Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  wants to form a Eurasian Union and is inviting other ex-
Soviet republics to join the economic union of Russia,
Kazakhstan and Belarus.  In an article in  Izvestia  distributed by his press office,
Putin wrote that the common economic space being formed by
Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus on Jan. 1 will unite 165 million
customers.  While it “would be naive to try to restore the USSR,”
economic integration based on trade liberalization is important,
Putin wrote in the article. The Eurasian Union would pursue
economic integration with the European Union, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
