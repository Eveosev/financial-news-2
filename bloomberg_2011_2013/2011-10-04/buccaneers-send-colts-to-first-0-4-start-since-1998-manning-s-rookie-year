The  Tampa Bay Buccaneers  rallied past
Indianapolis 24-17, sending the Colts to their first 0-4 start
since Peyton Manning’s rookie season in 1998.  LeGarrette Blount had a 35-yard touchdown run with 3:15
remaining to snap a 17-17 tie last night at Raymond James
Stadium in Tampa, Florida.  The Buccaneers trailed 17-10 in the third quarter before
scoring two touchdowns in the final 16 minutes. Tampa Bay
improved to 3-1, while the Colts fell to 0-4 without Manning, a
four-time National Football League Most Valuable Player who
hasn’t recovered from neck surgery.  Curtis Painter made his debut as the Colts’ starting
quarterback and passed for 281 yards, with touchdowns of 87 and
59 yards to Pierre Garcon. Painter, a sixth-round draft pick in
2009, completed 4-of-11 passes in the fourth quarter and was
sacked three times.  The Colts turned to Painter after 38-year-old  Kerry Collins 
was knocked out of last week’s loss to Pittsburgh with a
concussion and didn’t practice ahead of yesterday’s game.  Blount finished with 127 rushing yards for the Buccaneers,
while quarterback Josh Freeman threw for one touchdown and ran
for another. Tampa Bay has won three straight games since a
season-opening loss against the 4-0 Detroit Lions.  The Colts are the fourth team to open the season with four
straight losses after the  Minnesota Vikings ,  St. Louis Rams  and
 Miami Dolphins .  Indianapolis has its longest losing streak since dropping
five in a row in 2001, the last season the Colts missed the
playoffs. In Manning’s rookie season, the Colts started 0-4 and
finished 3-13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
