Gasoline fell to the lowest level
since February on concern that European leaders can’t contain
 Greece ’s debt crisis, threatening fuel demand and the global
economic recovery.  Futures sank as European governments dropped clues that
bondholders may be saddled with bigger losses on Greek debt. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of stocks fell 1.3 percent at 10:33
a.m. in  New York .  “It’s just a continuation of concern that Greece’s debt
crisis will spread and result in a slowdown of economic activity
through Europe and then extend throughout the U.S. and Asia,”
said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in
Houston.  Gasoline for November delivery fell 2.49 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.4861 a gallon at 10:35 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices touched $2.4673, the lowest level
since Feb. 15.  European financial leaders are trying to bolster Greece’s
economy, insulate Italy and Spain and shore up banks that the
 International Monetary Fund  says face as much as 300 billion
euros in credit risks.  Prices slipped amid a broader decline in commodities. The
S&P GSCI Index of 24 raw materials lost 1.3 percent at 10:34
a.m. in New York. Crude oil on the Nymex fell $1.54 to $76.07 a
barrel. Brent oil for November settlement lost $1.86 to $99.85
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  “All this doesn’t bode well for demand,” said  Sander Cohan , an analyst with Energy Security Analysis Inc in
Wakefield, Massachusetts. “There’s a lot of potentially bad
economic news out there and a lot of anxiety over growth for
next year."  Heating oil for November delivery declined 3.18 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $2.7211 a gallon. Prices touched $2.6975, the
lowest level since Feb. 18.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.9
cent to $3.408 yesterday, according to AAA data. That’s the
cheapest since March 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
