Almirall SA (ALM)  cut its 2011 earnings
forecast, citing  Spain ’s ban on brand-name medicine
prescriptions to lower costs as part of austerity measures.  Profit excluding one-time items may fall in the “high
twenties” percentage range, while next year’s earnings may
decline by a smaller amount, the Barcelona-based company said in
a statement today.  Full-year sales will drop by about 10 percent in 2011, with
similar declines next year unless there’s “unpredicted
circumstances,” Almirall said. The company will provide more
financial information about 2012 when it publishes third-quarter
earnings Nov. 14, it said.  Almirall sank 20 cents, or 3.9 percent, to 4.87 euros at
9:30 a.m. in Madrid trading. The stock has lost 29 percent this
year, valuing the company at 808.9 million euros ($1.07
billion).  Almirall previously predicted a percentage sales decline in
the high single digits this year, and a percentage drop in
profit in the mid teens.  Spain’s Cabinet approved measures to save 2.4 billion euros
a year on pharmaceutical spending, banning doctors from
prescribing brand-name drugs in an attempt to trim the  budget
deficit , the Health Ministry said Aug. 19.  Doctors will have to cite active pharmaceutical ingredients
in prescriptions rather than branded medicines. The measures
also include a 15 percent price reduction on drugs that are at
least 10 years old for which there is no generic available,
excluding drugs protected by patent in all the states of the
European Union, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
