U.S. stocks rose, erasing earlier
losses, following a report that European Union officials were
examining ways to coordinate the recapitalization of struggling
banks and valuations at the cheapest level since 2009 lured
investors.  The S&P 500 climbed 0.5 percent to 1,104.76 at 3:41 p.m. in
 New York  after plunging as much as 2.2 percent to below
1,090.888, a level that would mark a 20 percent bear-market drop
from a three-year high on April 29. The index started the
session trading at 12 times its companies reported earnings, the
cheapest in 30 months.  The Financial Times quoted  Olli Rehn , European commissioner
for economic affairs, as saying there is an “increasingly
shared view” that the region needs a coordinated approach to
halt the sovereign debt crisis.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
