Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV)  postponed a
board meeting yesterday to meet with investors including
representatives of the savings banks Novacaixagalicia, Unicaja
and BMN that are pressing Chairman Luis Del Rivero to end his
battle with  Repsol YPF SA (REP) , Expansion reported.  Senior executives met investors over dinner in a bid to
heal the split among Sacyr’s director’s over Del Rivero’s
attempt to increase his sway at Repsol through a shareholders’
pact with  Petroleos Mexicanos , the newspaper said, citing people
familiar with the discussions.  Sacyr executives have a second meeting scheduled for today
with representatives from Repsol and La Caixa, the oil company’s
second-biggest shareholder, Expansion added.  Sacyr’s two biggest shareholders Demetrio Carceller and
Juan Abello, who own almost 26 percent of the company, also
oppose Del Rivero’s tactics, the newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
