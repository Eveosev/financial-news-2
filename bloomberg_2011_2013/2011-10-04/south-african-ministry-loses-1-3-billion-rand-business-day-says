South Africa ’s Department of Public
Works failed to provide evidence for how 1.3 billion rand ($158
million) of capital expenditure was spent, Business Day
reported, citing a report by the country’s auditor-general.  The audit gave the ministry, which manages most of the
government’s properties, a “disclaimer,” the lowest possible
report, the Johannesburg-based newspaper reported.  Public Works Minister Gwen Mahlangu-Nkabinde said she was
aware of the corruption in her department and was working to
improving the situation, according to Business Day. Sam
Mkhwanazi, her spokesman, said he may send Bloomberg News a
statement on the matter later today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
