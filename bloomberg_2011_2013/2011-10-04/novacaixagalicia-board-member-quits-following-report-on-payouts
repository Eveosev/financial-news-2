A Novacaixagalicia board member said
she resigned after a newspaper reported that three executives at
the failed Spanish savings bank received a total of 23.6 million
euros ($31.2 million) after leaving the company.  Mar Barcon  said she resigned today after El Pais reported
that Novacaixagalicia set aside the money to cover the costs of
the departure of the executives including Francisco Javier
Garcia Paredes, a former joint general director.  “I cannot stay in my position after what has happened,
knowing that thousands of Galicians are going through hard
times,” Barcon, a socialist member of La Coruna city council
who was on the 22-member board, said in a phone interview.  Novacaixagalicia was one of three lenders taken over by the
Bank of  Spain  on Sept. 30 after it failed to meet a deadline to
bridge a 2.47 billion-euro capital shortfall. The government
bailout fund on Sept. 28 fired Maria Dolores Amoros, the general
director of  Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo (CAM) , a savings bank
seized in July, as it probes the award to her of an annual
364,947-euro pension and the preparation of the lender’s
accounts.  Paredes declined to comment when reached by telephone, as
did spokesmen for Novacaixagalicia and the Bank of Spain.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story: Charles
