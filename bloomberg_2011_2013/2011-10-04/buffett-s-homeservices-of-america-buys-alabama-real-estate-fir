Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A)  acquired a residential-real estate firm in Mobile, Alabama,
through its HomeServices of America Inc. unit as the billionaire
chairman prepares his company for a housing rebound.  Dauphin Realty, with four branches and 85 agents, will
merge with an existing Berkshire-owned firm in Alabama,
HomeServices said today in a  statement  published on its website.
Terms weren’t disclosed.  A housing slump has undercut U.S. home values this year as
foreclosures and unemployment of more than 9 percent weigh on
consumer sentiment. Buffett, 81, said today that a recovery is
inevitable once the current supply of housing is used up.  The slump is “a necessary correction, but it is not a
correction that’s over in a day or a week or a month,” Buffett
said at Fortune magazine’s Most Powerful Women conference in
Laguna Niguel,  California . “It will be over, there’s no
question about it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
