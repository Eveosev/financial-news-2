Taiwan ’s dollar sank to a 10-month
low and government bonds rallied for a third day as European
finance chiefs failed to resolve differences over how best to
contain a regional debt crisis.  Benchmark stock indexes slumped across Asia and the  U.S.
dollar  strengthened versus 15 of 16 major global currencies
after German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  opposed moves
to increase the scale of the euro rescue fund, damping
speculation of a breakthrough in Luxembourg talks to quell the
crisis. Global inflationary pressure is easing as the world
economic recovery slows, Taiwan’s central bank said in a report
released yesterday.  “Europe continues to be the concern of the market,” said
Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. in
Taipei. “Bond yields will remain range-bound for the time being
as investors generally think the central bank will keep  interest
rates  unchanged.”  Taiwan’s dollar retreated 0.3 percent to NT$30.680 against
its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local close, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$30.722 earlier, the weakest
level since Dec. 6, 2010.  The yield on the 1.25 percent notes due September 2021, the
most-traded government securities, fell to 1.260 percent from
1.264 percent yesterday, prices from Gretai Securities Market
show. That was the lowest level for benchmark 10-year rates in a
week. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.397 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
