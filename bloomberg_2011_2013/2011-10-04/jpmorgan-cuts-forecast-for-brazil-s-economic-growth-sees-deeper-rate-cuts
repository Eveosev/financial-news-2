JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  cut its forecast
for Brazil’s economic growth and said it expects the central
bank to cut  interest rates  more than it previously expected as
global financial turmoil weighs on confidence in Latin America’s
biggest economy,  The bank, in an e-mailed report, said it expects policy
makers to reduce the benchmark interest rate to 10.5 percent by
January from its current 12 percent. Previously the bank
expected the so-called Selic rate to fall to 11 percent in
January.  Latin America’s biggest economy should grow 2.3 percent in
the second half of the year, less than a 3.1 percent forecast
made Aug. 8, JPMorgan analysts wrote in the report. The economy
next year should expand 3.4 percent instead of a previous 3.8
percent forecast.  “Domestic growth prospects for next year still seems
cushioned by a more preemptive monetary policy response and the
buffers from fiscal and quasi fiscal policies,” JPMorgan
analysts including Fabio Akira wrote in today’s report.  The currency will end the year at 1.80 per  U.S. dollar ,
compared with the previous forecast of 1.70, JPMorgan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
