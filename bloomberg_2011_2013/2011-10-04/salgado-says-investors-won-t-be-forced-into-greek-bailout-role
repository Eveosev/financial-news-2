Spanish Finance Minister  Elena
Salgado  said investors won’t be forced to participate in a
second bailout program for  Greece .  Salgado said private-sector involvement won’t be greater
than envisioned in a July 21 agreement on Greece. She spoke to
reporters in Luxembourg today.  Euro-area finance chiefs will decide on a further aid
payment to Greece after they receive the assessment of the so-
called troika mission, she said.  “In any case it gives us more tranquility to know that
Greece doesn’t need the money as urgently as we had thought,”
she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
