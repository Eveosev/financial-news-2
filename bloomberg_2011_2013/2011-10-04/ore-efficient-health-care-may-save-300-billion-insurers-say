Shifting the focus of health care to
more-efficient service sooner could save the federal government
more than $300 billion over 10 years, The Blue Cross and Blue
Shield Association said today.  Incentives for quality service and reduced medical errors
would eliminate infections and complications that harm thousands
of people each year and pare the costs of redundant and
unnecessary services, said the Chicago-based association, which
represents 39 Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans. More emphasis on
primary care and encouraging healthy lifestyles would also save
money, the group said in a report.  The 2010 health-care law was aimed at curbing rising
health-care costs while expanding coverage to uninsured
Americans. While some of the association’s proposals are in the
overhaul, they need to be implemented faster, the group said.  “We believe the health-care system needs to fundamentally
change so that people get the best, most-affordable care
possible, Scott P. Serota, association president and chief
executive, said in a statement. “We need to put the patient
back in the center of health care.”  The association’s members include Indianapolis-based
 WellPoint Inc. (WLP) , the nation’s largest health insurer by
enrollment, and together cover about 100 million people, or one
in three Americans, in 50 states and territories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
