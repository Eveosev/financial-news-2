Westinghouse Solar Inc., a designer
and installer of solar power systems, filed a patent
infringement complaint against the Chinese panel maker  Canadian
Solar Inc. (CSIQ)  and Zep Solar Inc., which makes mounting components.  Westinghouse said the companies are infringing two patents
related to integrated racking, grounding and wiring, according
to a statement today from the Campbell, California-based
company. In its complaint to the International Trade Commission,
Westinghouse requested a ban on imports of certain Zep and
Canadian Solar products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
