Former National Football League
offensive tackle Orlando Brown died of diabetes complications,
according to the Maryland  medical examiner’s office .  Brown, who once sued the NFL for $200 million after a
penalty flag hit him in the eye, was found dead on Sept. 23 in
his downtown Baltimore apartment. He was 40.  Brown died of diabetic ketoacidosis, which the Mayo
Clinic’s  website  says is a serious complication of diabetes that
develops when there’s not enough insulin in the body.  Brown, who was nicknamed “Zeus,” started 119 games in a
nine-year NFL career with the  Baltimore Ravens  and  Cleveland
Browns . He retired after the 2005 season. He was listed on Pro-
Football-Reference.com as being 6-foot-7 and 360 pounds when he
played.  On Dec. 19, 1999, while playing for  Cleveland , Brown was
hit in the eye by a penalty flag thrown by referee Jeff Triplette. His eyesight was damaged and he didn’t play for three
seasons. Brown sued the league for $200 million and settled for
$25 million, according to the Baltimore Sun.  To contact the reporters on this story:
