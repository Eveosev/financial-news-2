Merck KGaA (MRK)  said its Merck Serono unit
will develop and market a pill for multiple sclerosis with
 Japan ’s Ono Pharmaceutical Co. to compete with a similar product
made by  Novartis AG. (NOVN)   The experimental therapy, ONO-4641, is in the second of
three stages of clinical trials usually required for regulatory
approval, Merck said in a statement today. The companies will
also collaborate in Japan on the development and marketing of
Merck’s Stimuvax, a cancer treatment in the final stage of
trials, according to the statement.  ONO-4641 is Darmstadt, Germany-based Merck’s second attempt
to develop a tablet for MS after it decided not to seek approval
of its cladribine pill in June. Novartis’s Gilenya, the first
oral drug for MS, was approved last year and  Israel ’s  Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)  is developing a competing
laquinimod pill.  “There’s a huge unmet clinical need,” said Gustav Ando, a
London-based analyst at consulting company IHS Global Insight.
With a pill, “the patient doesn’t have to go to the hospital
for monthly injections, which significantly impedes quality of
life.”  Novartis has 13,000 patients on Gilenya, the Basel,
Switzerland-based company said in July. The drug may reach $1.2
billion in sales by 2013 and $2.1 billion by 2015, according to
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s a very lucrative market,” Ando said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
