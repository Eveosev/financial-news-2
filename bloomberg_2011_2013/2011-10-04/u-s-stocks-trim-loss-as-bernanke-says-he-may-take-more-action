U.S. stocks trimmed losses as the
cheapest valuations since 2009 lured equity investors and
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank
is ready to take additional steps to boost growth.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.5 percent to
1,093.71 at 11:20 a.m., returning above the 1,090.888 level that
would signal a bear-market drop of 20 percent from its April
peak. It plunged as much as 2.2 percent to 1,074.77 earlier. The
gauge started today trading at 12 times its companies reported
earnings, the lowest level since March 2009.  “We’re really oversold,” Paul Zemsky, the New York-based
head of asset allocation for ING Investment Management, said in
a telephone interview. His firm oversees $550 billion. “The Fed
has indicated that it’s not out of bullets. There’s no sign of
recession in the U.S. and yet the market is pricing for one. So
you’re going to have days when things pop up and you’re going to
have bear market rallies.”  Stocks recovered from their lows of the session as Bernanke
said today in testimony to Congress’s Joint Economic Committee
in Washington that the Fed “will continue to closely monitor
economic developments and is prepared to take further action as
appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context
of  price stability ,”  About $10 trillion was wiped from global equity markets in
the third quarter. As of yesterday, benchmark measures for 37
out of 45 nations in the MSCI All-Country World Index posted
declines of 20 percent or more from their peaks, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Besides the U.S., only two other
developed markets --the U.K. and  New Zealand  -- hadn’t dropped
20 percent or more from their most-recent highs.  The  S&P 500  tumbled 14 percent in the third quarter, the
worst drop since the three months ending December 2008. The
Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 17 percent in the third quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
