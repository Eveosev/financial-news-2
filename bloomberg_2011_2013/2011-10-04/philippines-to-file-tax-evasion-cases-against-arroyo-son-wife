The Philippines’ Department of
Justice found “probable cause” to file charges against the
lawmaker son of former President  Gloria Arroyo  and his wife,
based on a 28-page resolution.  Tax evasion cases against Juan Miguel Arroyo and wife
Angela will be filed before the Court of Tax Appeals, according
to the resolution released today. The nation’s main tax agency
in April alleged that the couple evaded about 73.9 million pesos
worth of taxes.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
