European Union finance ministers
today reached an agreement on how to move forward with
derivatives legislation in a way that satisfies the concerns of
the U.K. and other member nations, an EU official said.  The agreement doesn’t widen the scope of the current
derivatives legislation, as the U.K. had sought. Instead, it
provides for an EU declaration that any derivatives not forced
into central clearing by the current proposal would be covered
by future EU rules.  Finance ministers also agreed to restore a provision that
would allow “open access” to clearinghouses, that had been
removed from earlier drafts. And they agreed that 26 of the 27
EU states would need to agree in order to block action by an EU
member country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
