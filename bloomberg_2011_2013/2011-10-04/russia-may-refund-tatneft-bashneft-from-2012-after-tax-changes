Russia  may reimburse OAO Tatneft and
OAO Bashneft for revenue lost as a result of the so-called 60-66
oil tax measure, Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Shatalov told
reporters today in Moscow.  The  oil companies  may be compensated for 100 percent of
their losses from next year through to 2015, Shatalov said. The
compensation will be in the form of discounts to the mineral
extraction tax, he said.  Russia plans to introduce the 60-66 tax measure to spur
investment in production of crude and quality fuels from Oct. 1.
Levies will rise for heavy products such as  fuel oil  and will
fall for light products such as diesel.  Bashneft, which refines more oil than it produces, stands
to lose out from the tax adjustment.  Tatneft (TATN) , the oil producer
based in Russia’s Tatarstan region, said last year it may spend
as much as 290 billion rubles ($8.8 billion) building Russia’s
first new major refinery since the fall of the  Soviet Union .  The 60-66 formula lowers the crude export tax, using a
coefficient of 60 percent instead of 65 percent, while taxing
exports of all refined products at 66 percent of the crude levy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
