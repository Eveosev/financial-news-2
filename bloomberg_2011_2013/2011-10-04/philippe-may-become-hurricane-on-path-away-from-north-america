Tropical Storm Philippe may grow into
a hurricane tomorrow as the system curves around in the mid-
Atlantic, away from land, according to forecasters.  Philippe, 635 miles (1,022 kilometers) south-southeast of
 Bermuda , is moving west at 10 miles per hour with 65-mph winds,
the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said in an  advisory  on
its website at 5 p.m.  “Philippe is going to do a U-turn,” said Dan Kottlowski,
a meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,
 Pennsylvania . “There is no opportunity for it to make a turn
toward land in the Western Hemisphere.”  Philippe is the 16th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane
season, which runs from June through November. According to the
hurricane center’s  latest track , Philippe is expected to make a
turn to the northeast over the course of this week before
heading into the waters east of Bermuda.  Computer forecast models suggest another storm will develop
in the western Caribbean by next week, and it may move into the
eastern  Gulf of Mexico  toward  Florida , Kottlowski said.  “This far out, there are a lot of questions,” Kottlowski
said.  The models are in agreement that something will develop,
although the intensity is in question, he said. It may become a
hurricane with at least 74-mph winds or develop only into a
tropical storm, which has winds of 39 mph to 73 mph, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
