India ’s 10-year bonds fell for a
sixth day, the longest losing streak in three months, on
speculation demand for existing securities will decrease as the
government boosts debt sales.  Yields climbed to a three-year high after the  finance
ministry  said yesterday it will offer 150 billion rupees ($3
billion) of securities on Oct. 7, compared with the 110 billion
rupees it raised at the last auction on Sept. 9. The nation
plans to borrow 2.2 trillion rupees in the six months through
March, 32 percent more than a previous target. That means India
will miss a goal to cut its  budget deficit  to 4.6 percent of
gross domestic product, according to Standard & Poor’s and Fitch
Ratings.  “The market is concerned about the supply of bonds,” said
J. Moses Harding, Mumbai-based executive vice president at
IndusInd Bank Ltd. “The 10-year yield could rise as high as
8.65 percent in the weeks ahead.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent securities due April 2021 was
little changed at 8.54 percent at the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. It had earlier
risen to 8.55 percent, the highest level for benchmark 10-year
rates since September 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The government’s shortfall may increase to 5.5 percent of
GDP in the fiscal year through March from 4.7 percent in the
previous 12 months, said  Andrew Colquhoun , Hong Kong-based head
of Asia-Pacific sovereign ratings at Fitch. The company
yesterday said that any further deterioration in government
finances may “weigh” on India’s debt rankings, even though
last week’s decision to increase the annual borrowing plan was
expected.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
fell three basis points to 7.88 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
