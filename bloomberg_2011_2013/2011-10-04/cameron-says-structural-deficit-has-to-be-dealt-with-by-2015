U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said his government planned to deal with the structural part of
the  budget deficit  by the time of the next election in 2015.  “This isn’t some bureaucratic plan dreamt up in
Whitehall,” Cameron told  Sky News  today from Manchester,
northwest  England , where his  Conservative Party  is holding its
annual conference. By holding down  interest rates  “it’s
absolutely essential for every family in the country.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
