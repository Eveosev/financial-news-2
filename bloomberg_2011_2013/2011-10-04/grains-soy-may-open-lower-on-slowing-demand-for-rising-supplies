What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 10 cents to 12 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade as warm, dry weather this
week accelerates harvesting of the U.S. crop, which may be
larger than the government estimated in September,  Don Roose ,
the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa ,
said in a telephone interview.  -- Wheat futures may open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that commodity demand will decline
amid the European debt crisis and forecasts for rain to aid
planting in the southern U.S. Great Plains, Roose said  -- Soybean futures may open 12 cents to 15 cents a bushel lower
in Chicago as the harvest in the U.S. Midwest accelerates amid
speculation that demand will fall with the slowing world
economy, Roose said.  Soybean-oil  futures are expected to open
down 0.4 cent to 0.5 cent a pound, and soybean-meal futures may
open down $2.50 to $3.50 for 2,000 pounds of the  animal feed .  WHAT TO WATCH: (ALL TIMES NEW YORK)
