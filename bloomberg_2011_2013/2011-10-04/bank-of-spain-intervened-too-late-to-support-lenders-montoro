Cristobal Montoro, the economy
spokesman for  Spain ’s opposition  People’s Party , said the Bank
of Spain intervened too late to support the nation’s ailing
saving banks.  “It should have moved to support the saving banks at the
beginning of the crisis because they are a cause of the
crisis,” Montoro said during an interview with television
channel Telecinco. “Now this will cost more,” Montoro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
