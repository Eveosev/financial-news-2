Japanese stocks fell, with the  Nikkei
225 (NKY)  Stock Average dropping to its lowest level in a week, as
discord among European policy makers fueled concern the region
will fail to resolve its debt crisis, stalling global growth.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s largest lender
by market value, fell 3.8 percent, its steepest drop in over six
months after financial shares plunged in  New York . Mitsubishi
Corp., Japan’s biggest trading company, dropped 5.7 percent on
lower commodity prices.  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (9107)  tumbled 4.5
percent after the shipping line said it expects a loss because
of slumping cargo rates.  The Nikkei 225 fell 1.1 percent to 8,456.12 at the 3 p.m.
close of trading in Tokyo, its lowest close since Sept. 26. The

since the three months ended June 2010. The Topix lost 1.5
percent to 736.18 today, with about four shares falling for each

disorderly default,” said Koichi Kurose, chief economist in
 Tokyo  at Resona Bank Ltd. which oversees the equivalent of $68
billion in assets. “The politicians are all over the place.
Stocks are pricing in a scenario where the financial crisis
spreads in  Europe , the U.S. economy worsens and it leads to a
deterioration in the global economy.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 2.9 percent yesterday,
dropping to a one-year low, led by financial shares amid concern
that Europe’s debt crisis will spill over into the banking
system. Futures on the  S&P 500  climbed 0.6 percent today.  Greek Crisis  German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble yesterday
opposed moves to further increase the scale of a euro-area
rescue fund until three countries approve a previous upgrade.
Slovakia, the Netherlands and Malta have yet to ratify an
earlier decision to expand the European Financial Stability
Facility to 440 billion euros ($584 billion).  Europe’s financial leaders are fighting on multiple fronts,
trying to extinguish the Greek crisis while insulating Italy and
Spain and shoring up banks that the  International Monetary Fund 
says face as much as 300 billion euros in credit risk.  Japanese lenders dropped. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial dropped
3.8 percent to 331 yen, its steepest decline since March 29.
 Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , the country’s second-
largest bank by market value, dropped 1.5 percent to 2,114 yen.  Slower Global Growth  “The main thing that’s driving down the market is
Europe,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of investment
strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has almost $100
billion under management. “There’s this worry that Europe is
going to implode and drag down the U.S. with it. It’s not good
for  Asia .”  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its forecast for world
growth to 3.5 percent next year from a previous outlook of 4.3
percent, citing Europe’s deterioration. The U.S. also faces a 40
percent chance of a recession, the investment bank said.  More than $10 trillion was wiped from global equity markets
last quarter. Benchmark measures for 36 out of 45 nations in the
MSCI All-Country World Index posted declines of 20 percent or
more from their peaks, meeting the common definition of a bear
market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Besides the
U.S., only two other developed markets -- the U.K. and  New
Zealand  -- haven’t dropped 20 percent or more from their most-
recent highs.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)   Trading firms and commodity-related companies declined in
Tokyo after oil and copper prices fell. Mitsubishi Corp., which
gets about 43 percent of its revenue from commodities, slumped
5.7 percent to 1,429 yen, the biggest decline on the Nikkei 225.
Smaller rival Mitsui & Co. lost 2.9 percent to 1,043 yen.  Crude oil tumbled 2 percent in New York yesterday to its
lowest level in more than a year amid concern that slower growth
will mean less fuel consumption. Copper futures for December
delivery fell below $3 a pound to a 14-month low on signs that
demand for industrial metals will wane.  Kawasaki Kisen dropped 4.5 percent to 148 yen after saying
it expects a net loss of 30 billion yen in the fiscal year
ending March 31 because of slumping shipping rates and a drop in
the value of shares it owns. Japan’s third-largest shipper by
sales had forecast a profit of 2 billion yen.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s second-largest maker of
construction and mining equipment, slumped 5.1 percent to 1,540

from  China .  Automakers, still affected by parts shortages stemming from
Japan’s March 11 earthquake disaster, declined after reporting
falling sales in the U.S.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  dropped 2.5 percent
