European Central Bank President Jean-
Claude Trichet urged European leaders to work toward more
political unity to shield the 17-nation currency region against
future crises.  “In my personal view,  Europe  will need to make significant
progress towards political unity with an executive branch and a
parliament, both with extended responsibilities as in any
democracy,” Trichet said in a parliamentary hearing in Brussels
today. “Part of this executive branch would be a European
 finance ministry  which will be responsible, not necessarily for
a large federal budget, but certainly for a strong economic and
fiscal surveillance and governance, for the handling of the
financial sector and for the external representation of the
Economic and Monetary Union.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
