The European Union should adapt the
Maastricht Treaty that created the euro to meet challenges in
the bloc’s sovereign debt crisis,  Rheinische Post  cited German
Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  as saying in an interview.  An adjusted treaty should include the loss of fiscal
sovereignty if states don’t follow the rules and ask for
assistance, the newspaper cited Westerwelle as saying in an e-
mailed summary of an article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
