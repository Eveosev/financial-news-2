Canadian stocks rose for the first
time in four days as financial and energy shares advanced on
better-than-forecast economic reports from the U.S.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s biggest lender by
assets, advanced 1.7 percent.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ,  Canada ’s
largest oil and gas producer, gained 8.1 percent as crude oil
rebounded from a one-year low after U.S. supplies fell.
BlackBerry maker  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  increased 10 percent on
speculation the company may explore strategic options.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index rose 279.31
points, or 2.5 percent, to 11,457.22 at 4 p.m. Toronto time.  “That’s really the economic data,” Jeff Bradacs, a  money
manager  at  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC)  in Toronto, said in a
telephone interview. Bradacs’s team oversees C$1.7 billion ($1.6
billion). “A lot of people are expecting a significant
slowdown. We’re not really seeing that in the U.S.”  The S&P/TSX dropped 4.4 percent in the previous three days
to the lowest since July 2010 as banks and energy companies
declined on concern  Greece  may default and the European Union
may require bondholders to face bigger losses on Greek debt.
Canada’s stock benchmark lost 17 percent this year through
yesterday, which would be the second-biggest annual retreat in
the past 20 years behind 2008’s 35 percent plunge.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s non-manufacturing
index slipped to 53 from 53.3 last month. Economists had
forecast the index would fall to 52.8, the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey. Readings above 50 indicate expansion. U.S.
companies added 91,000 jobs last month, ADP Employer Services
said, exceeding the median economist forecast of 75,000.  Financials Rally  The eight S&P/TSX banks and the three largest insurers all
rose.  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , Canada’s third-largest lender by
assets, gained 3.1 percent to C$51.74. Royal Bank advanced 1.7
percent to C$46.72. Manulife,  North America ’s fourth-biggest
insurer, increased 4.9 percent to C$11.95.  Crude oil climbed 5.3 percent in  New York  after the U.S.
Energy Department said inventories declined 4.68 million barrels
last week. All 15 analysts in a Bloomberg survey had forecast a
gain.  Suncor advanced 8.1 percent, the most since March 2009, to
C$27.50.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the country’s second-
largest energy company by market value, rose 9.7 percent, the
most since November 2008, to C$30.68. Oil-sands developer
Ivanhoe Energy Ltd. gained 16 percent, the most since March
2009, to C$1.13.  Merger Rumors  RIM jumped 10 percent to C$24.64 for the biggest advance
since December 2009. Vodafone Group Plc may seek to buy Canada’s
largest technology company,  the Independent said , citing “vague
rumors.”  Simon Gordon, a Vodafone spokesman, declined to comment.
Marisa Conway, a spokeswoman for Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM,
didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.  Base-metals and coal producers in the S&P/TSX gained 6.2
percent after rallying 8.1 percent, the most since May 2009,
yesterday.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , Canada’s largest company in the
industry, advanced 9 percent to C$33.77.  Quadra FNX Mining Ltd. (QUX) ,
which operates in the U.S., Canada and  Chile , increased 11
percent to C$9.19.  Exploration Orbite VSPA Inc. (ORT/A) , which is
developing an alumina project in  Quebec  and extraction
technology, surged 26 percent to C$1.86.  Takeover Speculation  Capstone Mining Corp. (CS)  climbed 16 percent to C$2.69 on
speculation the Vancouver-based copper producer may be a
takeover target,  George Topping , a Toronto-based analyst at
Stifel Financial Corp., said today in a telephone interview. The
shares surged as much as 18 percent, the most intraday in 11
months.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest
fertilizer producer by market value, climbed 7.2 percent, the
most since August 2010, to C$46.55 as corn and wheat futures
rose. World agriculture stocks gained after Monsanto Co.
forecast a bigger profit than analysts had estimated.  Gold stocks climbed as the U.S. Dollar Index fell from the
highest level since January.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-largest gold producer by
market value, rose 3.1 percent to C$47.38. Yamana Gold Inc.,
Canada’s fourth-biggest company in the industry by market value,
advanced 5.2 percent to C$14.27.  Kirkland Lake Gold Inc. (KGI) , which
operates in Ontario, surged 9 percent to C$16.75 after reporting
a profit increase.  Industrial Companies  Eighteen of the 19 S&P/TSX industrial companies gained.
 SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. (SNC) , Canada’s largest engineering and
construction company, advanced 6.8 percent to C$42.71 after
closing at the lowest since July 2009 yesterday.  Bombardier
Inc. (BBD/B) , the maker of trains and airplanes, increased 6.1 percent
to C$3.84.  MacDonald, Dettwiler & Associates Ltd., an aerospace and
defense contractor, plunged 9.9 percent, the most since February
2009, to C$44.15. The drop reflects the completion of a Dutch
auction share buyback and wasn’t unexpected, Thanos Moschopoulos, an analyst at Bank of Montreal, said in an e-mail
message.  Neo Material Technologies Inc. (NEM) , which makes rare-earths and
zirconium products, climbed 15 percent to C$6.78 for the biggest
gain since January 2009. The shares’ recent decline was an
“overreaction,” Steve Arthur, an analyst at Royal Bank, said
in a note to clients. The shares tumbled 38 percent from Aug. 17
to yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
