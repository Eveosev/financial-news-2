U.K. gilts rallied as the euro-region
debt crisis stoked demand for comparatively safer assets and
investors added to bets the  Bank of England  will this week
announce further monetary stimulus to revive the economy.  The gains pushed yields on 30-year U.K. government debt to
the lowest since at least 1996 after Eurogroup policy makers
said they are weighing imposing further losses on Greek
bondholders. Gilts also rose after a report showed growth in
Britain’s construction industry slowed more than estimated in
September, strengthening the case for an expansion in the
central bank’s asset-purchase program, known as quantitative
easing. The pound fell against the dollar and the euro.  “There’s still a lot of uncertainty about the euro-zone
debt crisis and that gives gilts a bit of a bid from a safe-
haven point of view,” said  Elisabeth Afseth , a fixed-income
analyst at Evolution Securities Ltd. in London. “Yields are
also pushing lower because there’s a relatively good chance that
there will be further quantitative easing, possibly as early as
this week.”  The yield on the 30-year gilt due December 2040 fell 17
basis points to 3.256 percent, the lowest since at least March
1996 when Bloomberg began compiling the data, before settling at
3.32 percent as of 3:50 p.m. in London.  Benchmark 10-year gilt yields sank 11 basis points to 2.24
percent. The 3.75 percent security due September 2021 rose 1.03,
or 10.3 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 113.385. Two-year
note yields were two basis points higher at 0.60 percent.  ‘Increasingly Probable’  The pound fell 0.1 percent to $1.5414 and lost 0.9 percent
to 86.11 pence per euro. Sterling was little changed at 118.26
yen.  It is becoming “increasingly probable” that another round
of government-bond purchases may be needed to boost the economy,
Bank of England policy makers said in the minutes of its Sept. 8
policy meeting. The central bank has the tools available to
provide additional “monetary loosening” should the economy
continue to deteriorate, Chief Economist Spencer Dale said in an
interview with the  Daily Mail  published on Sept. 29.  Standard & Poor’s  affirmed the U.K.’s AAA credit rating and
said the outlook is stable, according to a statement released
yesterday. The ratings company described the U.K. as having a
“wealthy, open, and diversified economy, supported by a well-
established political system and macroeconomic policy framework,
which can react quickly to economic challenges.”  Credit Easing  U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne yesterday
proposed lending billions of pounds of public money directly to
companies struggling to obtain credit from banks as a means of
shoring up the economy. The proposal, which comes as the central
bank prepares to announce its next interest-rate and government
debt buying decisions on Oct. 6, would see the Treasury buy
bonds issued by small and mid-sized companies in a program known
as credit easing.  A gauge of building activity in the U.K. based on a survey
of purchasing managers dropped to 50.1 from 52.6 in August,
Markit and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply  in
London said in a  report  today. That’s lower than the median
forecast of 51.6 in a Bloomberg survey of 10 economists, though
it remained above the 50 level that indicates expansion.  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  indicated
bondholders will have to take larger losses on Greek debt than
planned. Finance ministers are considering revising a July plan
that foresaw investors contributing 50 billion euros ($66
billion), so-called private sector involvement, to a 159
billion-euro rescue.  The Treasury sold 3.25 billion pounds of 3.75 percent bonds
due September 2021 today at an average yield of 2.24 percent,
attracting demand worth 1.8 times the securities offered.  Gilts returned 12 percent this year, compared with 8.2
percent for German bunds and 9.9 percent for U.S. Treasuries,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federal of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
