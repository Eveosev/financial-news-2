Replacement of copper with other
materials may reduce demand for the metal by about 500,000
metric tons this year, according to researcher CRU.  Use of plastic for tube production, aluminum for high-
voltage energy cables and fiber optics for communications
cabling is driving substitution,  Paul Robinson , non-ferrous
metals group manager at London-based CRU, said by e-mail
yesterday. Aluminum may replace about 250,000 tons of copper, he
estimates.  Copper, used in tubing and wiring, more than tripled in two
years through 2010 on the  London  Metal Exchange, exceeding
aluminum’s 60 percent climb. Concern that copper supply would
fall short of demand helped prices to reach a record high of
$10,190 a ton in February of this year, discouraging consumption
of the metal.  Lost copper demand “constrains longer-term growth rates,”
Robinson said. “As copper loses these sectors, it also loses
any growth potential in the future.”  Copper demand is set to advance 3.7 percent to 19.9 million
tons this year, according to  Barclays Capital . About 22 percent
of production is used in the power-generation industry and 13
percent is consumed by electronics manufacturing, according to
RBS Global Banking & Markets.  Copper substitution may continue, particularly use of
aluminum, Robinson said yesterday at an LME conference in
London. Aluminum will have the strongest demand growth among
industrial metals in coming years, he said.  Copper for three-month delivery fell 1.8 percent to $6,865
a ton by 12:17 p.m. on the LME, extending this year’s drop to 28
percent. Aluminum rose 0.2 percent to $2,207.75 a ton, for an 11
percent annual decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
