Texas Governor and Republican
presidential contender  Rick Perry  lost about half of his support
over the past month as former Godfather’s Pizza chief executive 
officer  Herman Cain  moved up to tie him for second place, 
a Washington Post-ABC News poll found.  The shift in sentiment underscores the fluidity among
Republican candidates and dissatisfaction with them, prompting
some party donors and leaders to urge New Jersey Governor  Chris
Christie  to enter the race, the newspaper said.  Among Republican candidates, former Massachusetts Governor
Mitt Romney leads with 25 percent. Perry and Cain tie for second
with 16 percent, a 13-point drop for Perry and 12-point rise for
Cain since early September.  Representative Ron Paul of Texas got 11 percent support,
followed by former House speaker  Newt Gingrich  of Georgia and
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota with 7 percent
each. Former senator  Rick Santorum  had 2 percent support and
former Utah governor Jon Huntsman Jr. 1 percent, according to
the poll.  President Barack Obama’s approval rating remained little
changed at a record low, according to the survey. Overall, 42
percent of those questioned approved of the job he is doing,
while 54 percent disapproved. Among registered voters, he scored
alongside Romney, Perry and Christie, newspaper reported.  The telephone poll was conducted Sept. 29 to Oct. 2 among a
random national sample of 1,002 adults with a margin of sampling
error of plus or minus four percentage points for the full poll
and six points for the survey of Republicans and GOP-leaning
independents.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
