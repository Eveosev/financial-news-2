Thailand â€™s central bank may use
headline inflation rather than  core inflation  to guide monetary
policy, Finance Minister Thirachai Phuvanatnaranubala said.  The central bank currently uses core inflation, which
excludes fresh food and fuel prices, to guide monetary policy
and aims to keep it at less than 3 percent.  Policy makers are also studying whether to use a yearly
average instead of a quarterly averge to provide greater
flexibility, Thirachai said at a briefing in Bangkok today. The
inflation target range may be set at 3 percent, plus or minus
1.5 percent, Thiracahi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
