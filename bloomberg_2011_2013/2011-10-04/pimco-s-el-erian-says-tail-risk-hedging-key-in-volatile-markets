Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive
officer of Pacific Investment Management Co., said using tail-
risk hedging to guard against extreme market outcomes is
important as market volatility has surged.  “You’ve got to manage your tails much more actively,” El-
Erian said today during a conference in Boston. “We have to
recognize that frameworks have to evolve.”  El-Erian shares the title of chief investment officer with
 Bill Gross  at  Newport Beach , California-based Pimco, which
manages about $1.4 trillion in assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
