A  Chicago  tax attorney consented to a
court order barring him from promoting tax shelters that the
U.S. claimed were phony.  John E. Rogers agreed to the entry of orders against him
and two businesses, Sugarloaf Fund LLC and Jetstream Business
Ltd., without admitting to allegations made in a federal
complaint filed last year in federal court in Chicago.  The U.S. Justice Department accused Rogers of using
distressed Brazilian debt to improperly reduce his customers’
reported income, leading to more than $370 million in
deductions. U.S. District Judge Samuel Der Yeghiayan signed the
orders on Sept. 30.  “The Justice Department is committed to exposing and
shutting down fraudulent tax shelters and their promoters,” D.
Patrick Mullarkey, acting assistant U.S. attorney general in the
 Justice Department ’s tax division, said today in a statement
announcing the ban on Rogers and his businesses.  Rogers, reached by phone at his Chicago law office,
declined to comment on the court orders. He was formerly
affiliated with the law firm Seyfarth Shaw LLP.  The case is U.S. v. Rogers, 10-cv-07068, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of  Illinois  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
