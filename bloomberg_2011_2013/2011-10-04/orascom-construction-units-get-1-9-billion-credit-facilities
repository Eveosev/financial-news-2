Orascom Construction Industries (OCIC) ,
 Egypt ’s biggest publicly traded builder, said its fertilizer
units have secured about $1.9 billion in credit facilities.  The units will use the money to refinance existing credit
facilities, which had “significant portions maturing in 2013,”
the Cairo-based company said in a statement distributed by the
Regulatory News Service today.  The debt facilities include a $775 million, five-year loan
to the Egyptian Fertilizer Co., a 550 million euro ($725
million) five-year loan to OCI Nitrogen B.V., and as much as
$300 million in a three-year loan to OCI Fertilizer Holdings.  The funding also includes a $200 million loan to the
Egyptian Fertilizer Co. as part of an investment package from
the International Finance Corp. The IFC will help raise an
additional $125 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
