Serbia  and Russian Railways will sign
a preliminary agreement on three rail projects for the Balkan
country supported by a $800 million loan from Russia.  The agreements for upgrading the Belgrade-Pancevo railroad,
building new tracks between Valjevo and Loznica in western
Serbia and  purchasing Russian-made  diesel engines  will be
signed this week during a visit by the delegation of OAO Russian
Railways, Serbia’s Infrastructure Ministry said in an e-mailed
statement.  The $800 million loan for Serbian rail infrastructure,
negotiated by presidents  Dmitry Medvedev  and Boris Tadic in
2009, is also expected to support reconstruction of Serbia’s
rail link to the port city of Bar in neighboring Montenegro, and
completion of a new rail station in Belgrade, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
