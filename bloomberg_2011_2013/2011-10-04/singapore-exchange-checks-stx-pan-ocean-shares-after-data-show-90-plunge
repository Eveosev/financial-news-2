Singapore Exchange Ltd. (SGX)  said it was
checking on STX Pan Ocean Co. shares after data showed a 90
percent decline for  South Korea â€™s largest commodities-shipping
company.  Carolyn Lim, an exchange spokeswoman, declined to elaborate
on what steps the bourse was taking in a phone interview today.
Seoul-based STX Pan Ocean is also checking with the exchange, it
said by e-mail.  A combined 10,000 shares were sold in two trades at 90
Singaporean cents apiece at 8:58 a.m., according to data on the
