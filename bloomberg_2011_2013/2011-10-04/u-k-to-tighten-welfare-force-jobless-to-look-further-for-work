The U.K. government will force
jobseekers to spend longer searching for work each day and to
look further afield in a tightening of welfare rules.  Under plans announced today by Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s Conservative Party at its  annual conference  in
Manchester, northwest England, the unemployed will forfeit
benefits unless they spend several hours each day looking for
work within a 90-minute commute. Those who repeatedly refuse job
offers face losing their benefits for up to three years.  “People in the past have been parked on these benefits,”
Cameron told the BBC today. “It is right to reform” them.  The plan reflects the coalition government’s desire both to
spur economic growth and reduce the welfare bill as it tries to
eliminate the structural  budget deficit  by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
