Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez ’s
approval rating has risen to 58.9 percent since he announced
that he had cancer, according to Caracas-based polling firm
Datanalisis.  Chavez, who said he had a “baseball-sized tumor” removed
from his pelvic area in June, has seen his popularity rise 10
percentage points since July, according to Datanalisis. The poll
of 1,300 households, taken between Aug. 29 and Sept. 7, had a
margin of error of 2.74 percent.  “The president has managed the information he reveals
about his illness very well,” Datanalisis President Luis Vicente Leon said in a telephone interview. “Chavez always
talks about the future. He shows himself to be a battler and
he’s managed to get people to perceive him as such instead of a
as a sick man in a critical state.”  Chavez has said he is planning to run for a third
consecutive six-year term in an election scheduled for Oct. 7,
2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
