Soybeans tumbled to the lowest in
almost a year and corn and wheat dropped on speculation that
demand for the crops will shrink as the global economy falters,
while the accelerating U.S. harvest boosts supplies.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of equities was poised to
enter a bear market today after sliding more than 20 percent
from the peak this year on concern that European leaders may
need to renegotiate  Greece ’s bailout. About 21 percent of the
U.S. corn crop and 19 percent of the soybeans were harvested as
of Oct. 2, boosting supplies for makers of food, fuel and  animal
feed .  “We have some harvest pressure, we have some weaker
demand, we’ve got a stronger dollar, and we’ve got a weakening
global economy,” Frank Cholly Sr., a senior market strategist
at MF Global Holdings Inc., said by telephone from Chicago.
“There are definitely a lot of negative forces at play all at
the same time.”  Soybean futures for November delivery dropped 17.5 cents,
or 1.5 percent, to settle at $11.60 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the price touched $11.52, the
lowest for a most-active contract since Oct. 11, 2010. The
oilseed is down 17 percent this year.  The U.S. Dollar Index, which values the greenback against
six competing currencies, climbed to a nine-month high today
before paring gains. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of
19 commodities slid to the lowest level since Oct. 8, 2010.  Corn, Wheat Fall  Corn futures for December delivery fell 4.75 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $5.8775 a bushel. Yesterday, the price touched
$5.7225, the lowest for a most-active contract since Dec. 13,
before settling unchanged. The commodity has lost 6.6 percent
this year.  Wheat futures for December delivery declined 15.5 cents, or
2.5 percent, to $6.04 a bushel in Chicago. Earlier, the grain
touched $5.9675, matching yesterday’s three-month low. The most-
active contract has slumped 24 percent this year.  Warm, dry weather this week in the U.S. Midwest may speed
up the harvest, while rain forecast for the southern Great
Plains could boost winter-wheat planting,  Don Roose , the
president of U.S. Commodities Inc., said by telephone from  West
Des Moines ,  Iowa . The Plains may get as much as 1.5 inches (3.8
centimeters) from storms starting Oct. 7, according to a Telvent
DTN forecast.  U.S. corn output may total 12.553 billion bushels, more
than the Department of Agriculture’s estimate of 12.497 billion,
INTL FCStone Inc. said yesterday. The soybean harvest will total
3.157 billion bushels, more than the 3.085 billion forecast by
the USDA, the commodity-research company and brokerage said. The
USDA will update its forecasts Oct. 12.  Corn is the largest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government data
show. Wheat ranks fourth, valued at $13 billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
