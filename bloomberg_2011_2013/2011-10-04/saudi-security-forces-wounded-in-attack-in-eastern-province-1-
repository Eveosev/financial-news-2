The  U.S. Embassy  in  Saudi Arabia 
urged Americans planning to travel to four areas in the eastern
part of the kingdom to use caution, following clashes this week
between protesters and the security forces.  The “emergency message” on travel to al-Qatif, Awwamiya,
Safwa and Saihat was issued today by the embassy in the capital,
 Riyadh .  “While demonstrations may appear peaceful, the potential
exists for rapid escalation of a situation,” according to the
e-mailed message.  Saudi Arabia vowed to use “an iron fist” after the
government said 11 members of the security forces were attacked
and injured during unrest in Awwamiya on Oct. 3.  It accused an unidentified foreign country of seeking to
undermine the stability of the kingdom. The assailants, some on
motorcycles, used machine guns and Molotov cocktails, the
official Saudi Press Agency said.  The unnamed country is  Iran , which the Saudis accuse of
provoking unrest among the kingdom’s minority Shiite Muslims.  Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil supplier, escaped the
mass protests that toppled the leaders of Egypt and  Tunisia  this
year and spread to Saudi neighbors Yemen and Bahrain. There were
rallies earlier in the year in the eastern oil-producing hub,
where the Sunni Muslim kingdom’s Shiite  minority is
concentrated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
