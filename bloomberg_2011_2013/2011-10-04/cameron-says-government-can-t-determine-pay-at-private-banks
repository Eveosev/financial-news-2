U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said that the government won’t interfere in setting pay in banks
that are in private hands although he will continue to
ensure lenders partly owned by taxpayers have pay controlled.  “It’s important we don’t interfere in every single
company,” Cameron told BBC Radio 4. “If a bank is entirely in
the private sector, you can’t intervene in the pay structure of
every organization.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
