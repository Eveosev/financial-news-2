Ukrainian farmers planted 7 percent
less winter grain as of yesterday compared with a year earlier,
the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  Farmers sowed 5.1 million hectares (12.6 million acres)
with winter grains compared with 5.5 million a year ago, the
ministry said late yesterday in e-mailed statement.  Winter rapeseed also declined, to 890,000 hectares from
981,000 a year earlier, according to the statement.  Between 10 percent and 15 percent of winter grain and
rapeseed areas have optimal soil humidity, while the rest of
plantings are in unsatisfactory condition because of drought,
the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
