Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento
Economico e Social,  Brazil â€™s state development bank, will loan
297 million reais ($159 million) to  Renova Energia SA (RNEW11)  for five
wind farms as the country expands its investments in renewable
energy.  The projects in the northeastern state of Bahia will have a
total capacity of 98.8 megawatts, the Rio de Janeiro-based bank
said today in an e-mailed statement.  BNDES has approved 4.5 billion reais of loans for 70
renewable energy projects to date, according to the statement.  The five wind farms are in the towns of Igapora and
Guanambi and are among 14 Renova Energia projects that received
contracts to sell electricity in a 2009 government-organized
auction for new power capacity, BNDES said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
