Indonesia ’s rupiah declined for a
second day after global funds reduced holdings of the nation’s
assets on concern  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis will sap demand
for higher-yielding emerging-market assets.  International investors sold $60 million more local shares
than they bought yesterday, according to exchange data. The
currency pared losses in the last 90 minutes of trading after
having dropped as much as 0.8 percent earlier. Policy makers
will remain in the market to stabilize the rupiah, Bank
Indonesia’s Director of  Monetary Policy , Hendar, who goes by
only one name, said in a mobile-phone text message yesterday.  The rupiah dropped 0.1 percent to 8,906 per dollar as of
4:14 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
complied by Bloomberg. The currency slumped 2.9 percent last
month, the most since February 2009. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index
of shares fell after European finance ministers pushed back a
decision on releasing an 8 billion-euro ($10.5 billion) loan
installment to  Greece  until after Oct. 13.  “The possible default in Greece and the dimmer global
economic outlook are now the major concerns in the market,”
said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst at PT Bank Commonwealth
in Jakarta. “Global investors are taking profits in emerging
markets and holding more dollar assets.”  Indonesia’s benchmark 10-year bonds snapped a six-day
rally. The yield on the 8.25 percent notes maturing in July 2021
rose 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 6.98 percent,
according to Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
