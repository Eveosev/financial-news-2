Dubai’s benchmark index fell for a
fifth day, the longest losing-streak in more than four months,
as disagreement among policy makers over how to resolve  Europe ’s
debt crisis dimmed the outlook for the global economy.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , developer of the world’s tallest
skyscraper, decreased 3 percent.  Dubai Financial Market (DFM)  PJSC
sank to the lowest since 2009. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  slipped 1.4
percent to 1,387.31, the lowest level since March 7, at the 2
p.m. close in Dubai. The 14-day relative strength index for
Dubai was 21 today and 25.5 yesterday. A reading of below 30
indicates an asset is poised to gain, according to some
technical analysts.  “Fears are still related to Europe debt, especially with
the indecision between Europe’s policy makers,” said Samer Darwiche, a financial analyst at Gulfmena Investments in Dubai.  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  opposed moves to
further scale up the European Financial Stability Facility until
the final three countries approve the fund’s latest upgrade.
Slovakia, the Netherlands and Malta have yet to ratify an
earlier decision to expand the fund to 440 billion euros ($581
billion). The MSCI Emerging Markets Index declined 2.4 percent
and the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  lost 0.9 percent.  Europe’s financial leaders are fighting on multiple fronts,
trying to extinguish the Greek crisis while insulating Italy and
Spain and coming up with a formula for banks that the
 International Monetary Fund  says face as much as 300 billion
euros in credit risk.  Oil Break Even  U.S. crude for November delivery declined as much as 3.4
percent to $74.95 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council
need Brent crude, a European benchmark, at about $86.5 a barrel
this year to break even, according to a Deutsche Bank AG
analysis last month.  Brent crude futures have averaged $111.86 a barrel in 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and were 1.5 percent
lower at $100.22 a barrel today. The GCC, which includes the
U.A.E. and Qatar, holds more than a third of the world’s proven
oil reserves, according to data from BP Plc.  DP World Ltd. (DPW) , the Dubai government-controlled port
operator, slumped 2.9 percent, the most since Sept. 18, to $10.
Emaar fell to 2.56 dirhams, the lowest since March 8. Dubai
Financial Market, the only Gulf Arab stock market to sell shares
to the public, dropped 2.8 percent to 1.03 dirhams, the lowest
since February 2009.  About 85 million shares traded in Dubai today, compared
with this year’s daily average of 112 million shares.  Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  slipped 1.6 percent, Kuwait’s gauge lost
0.1 percent, Oman’s MSM 30 Index retreated 0.4 percent and  Abu
Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  dropped 0.9 percent. Bahrain’s BB All
Share Index fell 0.2 percent and Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All
Share Index (SASEIDX)  sank 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
