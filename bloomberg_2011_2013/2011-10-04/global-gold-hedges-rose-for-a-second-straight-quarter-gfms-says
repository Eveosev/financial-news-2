Global gold hedges, or sales of
future production, gained for a second straight quarter in the
three months through June and are set to climb for the first
year since 1999, according to Thomson Reuters GFMS.  The worldwide hedge book rose about 190,000 ounces to 5.07
million ounces in the second quarter, the first time hedging
occurred in consecutive quarters since 2001, the London-based
researcher said today in an e-mailed report. Hedging will
continue in the current half, taking 2011 net additions to about
1 million ounces, it said.  Gold producers sometimes sell future output at fixed prices
to secure loans. They can reduce hedges by buying back
contracts, adding to demand. Bullion for immediate delivery
traded at $1,653.38 an ounce by 5:30 p.m. in  London  yesterday
after reaching a record $1,921.15 on Sept. 6. It’s up 16 percent
this year and set for an 11th straight annual gain, the longest
winning streak since at least 1920 in London.  “It would be wrong to assume, however, that general
attitudes to hedging among the major gold mining companies have
changed,” GFMS said in the report. “In the face of a strongly
rising gold price, the pressure is currently still on company
management from investors to retain full exposure to rising
prices.”  Among companies that increased hedge positions, Perth,
Western Australia-based  Alkane Resources Ltd. (ALK)  added about 90,000
ounces of forward sales in the second quarter, the researcher
said.  Regis Resources Ltd. (RRL) , located in  Melbourne , added about
40,000 ounces, it said.  Bloomberg competes with Thomson Reuters Corp. in selling
