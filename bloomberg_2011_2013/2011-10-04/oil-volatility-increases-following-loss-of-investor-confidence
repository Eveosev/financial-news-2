Oil options volatility increased as
the underlying futures declined for a third day amid concern
that fuel demand will drop along with investor confidence in the
U.S. and European economies.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
November, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 56.1 percent at 2 p.m. in New York,
up from 53.1 percent yesterday.  Oil for November delivery fell $1.94, or 2.5 percent, to
settle at $75.67 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Oil has dropped 17 percent this year.  The most active options contract in electronic trading
today was November $70 puts, with 3,860 lots changing hands. The
options gained 34 cents to $1.29 a barrel. December $50 puts,
the next-most-active contract, rose 8 cents to 31 cents on
volume of 2,047. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The volume of puts outnumbered calls by about 60 percent to
40 percent.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  November $95 calls were the most active options traded in
the previous session, with 6,506 lots changing hands. They
declined 2 cents to 5 cents a barrel. The next-most active
options, November $70 puts, gained 19 cents to 95 cents a barrel
on volume of 7,571.  Open interest was highest for December $50 puts with 50,173
