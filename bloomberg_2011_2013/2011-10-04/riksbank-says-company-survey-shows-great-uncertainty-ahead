The Swedish central bank’s company
interviews showed that while “economic activity is good at
present,” there is “great uncertainty about the course of
development in the period ahead,” the Riksbank said in a
statment on its website today.  Companies haven’t seen a decline in new orders “as yet,”
the bank said. Still, “their assessment is that there is a
considerable risk of such a decline,” the survey showed. Most
companies see a deteriorating economic climate over the next
12 months, the Riksbank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
