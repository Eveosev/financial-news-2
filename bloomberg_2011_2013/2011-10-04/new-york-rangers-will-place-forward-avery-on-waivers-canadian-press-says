The  New York Rangers  placed forward
Sean Avery on waivers, three days before the start of their
National Hockey League season, the team said.  Avery, 31, had been in competition with Erik Christensen
for the Rangers’ final forward position and didn’t play in the
team’s past two preseason games.  Avery totaled three goals, 21 assists and 174 penalty
minutes in 76 games for the Rangers last season. If he isn’t
claimed by another NHL team by noon New York time tomorrow, the
Rangers could choose to send him to their American Hockey League
affiliate in Hartford, the Canadian Press said.  The Rangers open the regular season on Oct. 7 with a game
against the  Los Angeles Kings  in Stockholm,  Sweden .  To contact the reporter on this story:
