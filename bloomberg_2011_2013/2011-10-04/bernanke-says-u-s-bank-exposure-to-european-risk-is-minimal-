Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S. banking system has manageable exposure to
European nations buffeted by the sovereign debt crisis.  “We have looked very carefully at bank exposures both to
foreign sovereigns and to foreign banks,” Bernanke said. “The
exposures of U.S. banks to the most troubled sovereigns --
Portugal, Ireland and  Greece  -- is quite minimal. So the direct
exposures there are not large.”  Bernanke said questions about the solvency of European
nations and the stability of banks have created an “enormous
amount of uncertainty” in financial markets, and financial
volatility is one reason why the U.S. economic recovery has been
slower than projected this year.  Bernanke made the comments in response to a question from
Joint Economic Committee’s vice chairman, Representative Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican.  To contact the reporters on this story:
