California-blend gasoline in San
Francisco advanced to the highest premium versus futures in a
month after  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  started maintenance at the Richmond
refinery that may last six weeks.  The premium for Carbob in San Francisco jumped 5 cents to
27 cents a gallon above gasoline futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 4:38 p.m. East Coast time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the highest premium since Sept.
2. Prompt delivery of the fuel rose 2.74 cents to $2.7584.  Chevron is conducting work at the 240,000-barrel-a-day
Richmond refinery, the largest one in northern  California , that
will last four to six weeks. The plant was scheduled to shut a
crude unit as part of the turnaround, a person familiar with the
plant’s operations said in July.  Carbob in  Los Angeles  widened its premium to futures by 3.5
cents to 24 cents. California-blend diesel in Los Angeles
weakened 3 cents to a premium of 11.5 cents above heating oil
futures traded on the Nymex.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  spilled at least a barrel of crude oil at
its Torrance refinery south of Los Angeles yesterday, Barbara
Burgett, a spokeswoman at the plant, said in an e-mail.  “There was no safety incident and no impact to production
nor the community,” she said. “The refinery is operating
normally.”  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon , rose
5.25 cents to 32 cents over futures. That’s the largest premium
for the fuel since Sept. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
