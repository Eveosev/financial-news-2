Oil fell to its lowest in more than a
year in New York on signs of rising U.S. supplies and production
from Libya.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  cut its 2012 forecast for
 Brent crude .  Futures slid as much as 2.8 percent in New York while Brent
fell to less than $100 a barrel. Goldman Sachs said Brent will
average $120 a barrel next year, down from $130. U.S. crude
inventories climbed for a second week, an Energy Department
report tomorrow may show. Libya aims to raise production to more
than 500,000 barrels a day by the end of this month, according
to the chairman of state-run National Oil Corp.  “Libyan production coming back at higher quantities than
originally thought is a bit bearish,” said  Hannes Loacker , an
analyst at Raiffeisen Bank International AG in Vienna, who
predicts Brent will average $107 a barrel this quarter. “The
most important thing of course is the economy, and fears of
slower growth in the emerging markets are a big driver. Risk is
clearly on the downside.”  Crude for November delivery declined as much as $2.16 to
$75.45 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest since Sept. 24, 2010, and was at $75.47 at
12:52 p.m. London time. Prices are down 17 percent this year.  Brent Outlook  Brent oil for November settlement fell as much as 1.8
percent to $99.84 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange, trading at less than $100 for the first time
since Aug. 9. The European benchmark contract was at a premium
of $24.43 to New York crude, compared with a record of $26.87 on
Sept. 6.  Jeffrey Currie , an oil analyst at Goldman Sachs, cited a
“flatter upward trajectory” as he cut his Brent crude
prediction. In a separate report, Goldman Sachs cut its global
economic growth forecast for this year and next, predicting
recessions in Germany and  France  as Europe stalls and the risk
of a contraction in the U.S. grows.  European finance ministers met in Luxembourg yesterday to
discuss the debt crisis. They considered “technical revisions”
to a July deal that foresaw investors contributing 50 billion
euros ($66 billion) to a 159 billion-euro rescue for  Greece .  Hedge funds and other money managers cut bullish bets on
Brent by 36 percent in the week ended Sept. 27, according to
data from ICE Futures Europe. Speculative bets that prices will
rise in futures and options combined outnumbered short positions
by 47,027 contracts, the London-based exchange said yesterday in
its weekly Commitment of Traders report.  Crude Supplies  The European benchmark future may fall to $84 a barrel
after its 50-day moving average fell below the 200-day average
last week in a formation known as the “death cross,” according
to technical analysis by hedge fund Again Capital LLC.  Libya  aims to raise oil output after the North African
nation restarted the Zawiya refinery, its second largest,
according to Nuri Berruien, the chairman of National Oil Corp.
The country’s goal of restoring crude production to 1.7 million
barrels a day within 15 months is a “conservative figure,” he
said yesterday in Tripoli.  Fighting in Libya reduced the availability of light, sweet
crude, or oil with low density and sulfur content. The country’s
output fell to 45,000 barrels a day in August, according to
Bloomberg estimates. The North African nation pumped 100,000
barrels a day last month.  U.S. crude inventories rose 1.9 million barrels last week,
according to the median of 10 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey before the Energy Department report. Gasoline
supplies climbed 1.23 million barrels, the survey shows.  New York  crude may test technical support at around $74 a
barrel and $64 a barrel, levels that correspond with the 50 and
62 percent retracement levels on a Fibonacci study from lows in
January 2009, said  Stephen Schork , president of Schork Group
Inc., an energy advisory company in Villanova,  Pennsylvania .  To contact the reporters on this story:
