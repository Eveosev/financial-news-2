Iran  has detained more than half of
the 37 suspects sought in a $2.6 billion financial fraud case,
Prosecutor General Golamhossien Mohseni-Ejei said.  Amir Mansour Aria Development Co. and affiliated companies
linked to the family of Amir Khosravi are the main entities
suspected of involvement in the scam, Mohseni-Ejei said in an
interview with Iranian state television late yesterday.  Seven state and private banks were linked to the case,
which involved the forging of letters of credit from Bank
Saderat to secure loans that were then used to purchase state-
owned companies, Iranian media have reported.  Most of the money was not transferred to off-shore
accounts, Mohseni-Ejei said. The main suspects have been
transferred to a prison in Tehran from the southwestern city of
Ahvaz for further investigations, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
