U.S. stocks rallied, driving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index up 4.1 percent in the final 50
minutes, amid speculation European Union officials are examining
how to recapitalize the region’s banks. Treasuries fell and the
euro rallied.  The  S&P 500  surged 2.3 percent to 1,123.95 at 4 p.m. New
York time, sparing the benchmark measure of U.S. equities its
first bear market, or 20 percent retreat from a peak, since
2009. Yields on Treasury 10-year notes climbed 6 basis points to
1.82 percent. The euro appreciated 1.1 percent to $1.3322.
Futures on Germany’s DAX Index pared their loss to 1 percent
from 4.9 percent.  Equities rebounded after the S&P 500 fell below 1,090.89,
the closing level required to give the index a 20 percent slump
from the three-year high reached on April 29. Stocks rose after
the Financial Times quoted  Olli Rehn , European commissioner for
economic affairs, as saying there is an “increasingly shared
view” that the region needs a coordinated approach to halt the
sovereign debt crisis. After U.S. markets closed, Belgian Prime
Minister  Yves Leterme  said a “bad bank” to hold  Dexia SA (DEXB) ’s
troubled assets will be set up.  “The European crisis has been the market driver,”  Richard Sichel , who oversees $1.6 billion as chief investment officer at
Philadelphia Trust Co., said in a phone interview. “If Europe
comes out with something to kick the can down the road, it buys
them more time. We learned in 2008 how important the financial
system is and how a ripple effect can occur.”  Morgan Stanley (MS)  Jumps  Banks, brokerages and insurers led the rally as the S&P 500
Financials Index jumped 6.5 percent between 3:18 p.m. and 4 p.m.
New York time. Morgan Stanley surged 17 percent and  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  soared 10 percent during the same period.  Stocks were due for a rally after the S&P 500 fell 5.3
percent in the previous two sessions, said Paul Zemsky, the New
York-based head of  asset allocation  for ING Investment
Management. His firm oversees $550 billion. The S&P 500 is
trading for 12.3 times earnings in the last 12 months, close to
the cheapest valuation since March 2009.  “The market doesn’t go on a straight line either up or
down,” he said in a telephone interview. “There’s no sign of
recession in the U.S., and yet the market is pricing for one. So
you’re going to have days when things pop up and you’re going to
have  bear market  rallies.”  200-Day Average  About 7 percent of S&P 500 stocks began the day trading
above their average price in the last 200 days, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That matched the proportion
following the Aug. 8 rout for the lowest level in 30 months. The
full index began today 14.1 percent below its 200-day moving
average, the biggest gap since April 30, 2009.  U.S. stocks followed European shares lower earlier as some
officials signaled bondholders may have to take bigger losses on
Greek debt than previously negotiated. The possible breakup of
Belgian bank Dexia and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s abandonment of its
profit forecast added to signs that contagion from the debt
crisis is spreading. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its global
growth forecasts and predicted recessions in  Germany  and  France .  Treasuries extended losses after the Financial Times
report. Yields on 30-year bonds rose 9 basis points to 2.81
percent.  “People are looking for optimism anywhere they can get
it,” said Christopher Bury, co-head of fixed-income rates at
Jefferies & Co., one of the 22 primary dealers that trade with
the  Federal Reserve . “You have these random stories and the
market reacts, but how many times have we been down this road
where these are just words?”  To contact the reporters on this story:
