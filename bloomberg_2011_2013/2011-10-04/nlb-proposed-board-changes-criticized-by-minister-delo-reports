Changes on the supervisory board of
Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. aren’t “worth the effort and
time,” Delo newspaper  reported , citing Slovenia’s European
Union and Development Minister Mitja Gaspari.  The agency for managing state assets has proposed replacing
four supervisors out of 11, including President Marko Simoneti,
to “adapt the bank’s business to better face the challenges of
the economic and financial crisis,” the Ljubljana-based
newspaper said.  Shareholders are set to vote on the proposal on Oct. 27
along with a 400 million-euros ($529 million) capital boost that
is a second such move this year after the central bank asked
Slovenia’s biggest lender to improve its  capital ratios .  To contact the reporter on this story:
