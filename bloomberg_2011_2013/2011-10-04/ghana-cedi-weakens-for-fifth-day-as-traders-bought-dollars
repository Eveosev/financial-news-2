The Ghanaian cedi, the currency of
West Africa’s second-biggest economy, weakened for a fifth day
to its lowest since at least 1994 as traders bought dollars to
import goods for sale.  The currency depreciated as much as 1 percent to 1.6210 per
dollar before paring the loss to 1.6125 by 3:17 p.m. in Accra,
the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Demand for dollars from the commerce industry was what
drove the market today,” Biggles Amponsah, a currency trader at
the local unit of Access Bank Plc, said by phone. “The market
is not liquid. One small transaction moves the  exchange rate 
very very high.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
