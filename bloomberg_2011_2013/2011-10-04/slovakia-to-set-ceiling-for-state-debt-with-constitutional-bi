Slovak political parties are united
in supporting a constitutional bill that would impose a cap on
state debt as the eastern euro-area country seeks to strengthen
public finances.  A multipartisan group of lawmakers will submit legislation
to parliament in the capital Bratislava that would trigger an
automatic freeze in spending and other sanctions should state
debt near 60 percent of gross domestic product, according to a
draft bill. The ceiling is set to decline gradually to 50
percent of GDP.  The bill unveiled today by deputies including budget
committee head Jozef Kollar, assumes tougher sanctions as debt
gets closer to the limit. Should it exceed 57 percent of GDP,
the government must prepare a balanced budget, while crossing
the limit would result in a confidence motion against the
government. Penalties can be avoided in case of a significant
recession, a banking-industry bailout and a natural disaster.  The debt crisis that started in  Greece  last year has spread
to other euro-area members, underscoring a need to put public
finances of all regionâ€™s countries onto a sustainable path. The
European Commission forecasts Slovak state debt to reach 45
percent of GDP this year, about half the level for the whole
euro region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
