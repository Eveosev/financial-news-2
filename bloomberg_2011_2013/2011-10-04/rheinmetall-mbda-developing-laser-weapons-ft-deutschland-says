Rheinmetall AG (RHM)  and missile-maker
MBDA’s German subsidiary are both testing laser weapons,
 Financial Times Deutschland  reported, without saying where it
got the information.  Rheinmetall succeeded last week in shooting down a flying
microdrone at a test facility in  Switzerland , while MBDA’s
device was able to hit moving objects from a distance of 2.3
kilometers (1.4 miles), FT Deutschland reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
