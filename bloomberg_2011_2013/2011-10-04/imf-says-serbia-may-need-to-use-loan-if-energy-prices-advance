Serbia  may need to tap its new loan
from the  International Monetary Fund  if energy prices rise, the
fund’s Country Director Bogdan Lissovolik said.  “Right now it is highly improbable that Serbia will need
the funds,” Lissovolik told reporters today at a conference in
the capital Belgrade. Serbia could be forced to use the loan if
energy prices rise dramatically because Serbia is a net energy
importer or if the price of its exports slumps or if there are
capital outflows, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
