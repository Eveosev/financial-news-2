OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP) , a Russian producer
of coal for steelmakers, may produce less than 6.5 million
metric tons this year, missing its output target by 24 percent,
 Kommersant  reported, citing analystsâ€™ estimates.  Raspadskaya produced 400,000 tons of coal a month in July
and August versus average 576,000 tons a month in the first
half, the Moscow-based newspaper said, citing Metal-Courier
data. The company will probably miss its full-year output target
of 8.5 million tons, according to the newspaper.  Raspadskaya had a market value of about $2.2 billion
yesterday, while steelmaker  Evraz Group SA (EVR)  and Raspadskaya
management have been seeking to sell the company for more than
$5 billion in the first half of the year, Kommersant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
