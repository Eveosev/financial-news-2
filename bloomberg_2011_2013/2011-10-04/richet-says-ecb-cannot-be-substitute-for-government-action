European Central Bank President Jean-
Claude Trichet said the bank is not in a position to assume
governments’ responsibilities.  “We cannot substitute governments,” Trichet said in a
parliamentary hearing in Brussels today. “We can take a number
of decisions but under no circumstances can we replace
governments.”  The ECB tried to act “as prudent and cautious as possible
within the limit of our mandate,” Trichet said. “To be in
denial that we are in the worst crisis since World War II that
would be the most terrible mistake you could make.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
