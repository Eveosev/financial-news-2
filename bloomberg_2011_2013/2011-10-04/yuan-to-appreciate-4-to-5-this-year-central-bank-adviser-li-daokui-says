The yuan will appreciate by 4 percent
to 5 percent against the  U.S. dollar  this year,  Li Daokui , an
adviser to the People’s Bank of China, said at a conference in
Chile today.  Yuan gains won’t help the U.S. economy because tariffs to
counter the  exchange rate  mean "the U.S. will import from other
countries more," Li said. This will push up costs and fuel
inflation, he said. He called the debate “only the tip of the
iceberg,” with the real issue growing distrust of globalization.  The yuan has appreciated 5.2 percent against the U.S.
dollar in the past year and 24 percent in the past five years,
the steepest advance among 25 emerging-market currencies tracked
by Bloomberg. China limits currency conversions for investment
purposes and buys dollars to slow the yuan’s advance and
preserve the competitiveness of  China ’s exports.  Li said that he expects China’s economy to continue to grow
8 percent to 9 percent annually, so further stimulus projects
aren’t needed. The nation’s slower growth won’t be a disaster
for resource economies, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
