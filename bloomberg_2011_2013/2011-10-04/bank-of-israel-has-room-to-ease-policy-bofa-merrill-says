The  Bank of Israel  “has room to ease
policy considerably going forward” based on inflation
expectations, David Hauner head of Eastern Europe,  Middle East 
and Africa economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London,
wrote in a report today.  Market inflation expectations have been “the best guide”
to the Bank of Israel’s rate setting in recent years, Hauner
wrote. Governor Stanley Fischer last week cut the benchmark
lending rate by a quarter percentage point to 3 percent.  Israel’s two-year breakeven rate, which reflects market
expectations for inflation over the period, was at 1.76 at 11:54
a.m. in Tel Aviv, implying an average annual inflation rate of
1.76 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
