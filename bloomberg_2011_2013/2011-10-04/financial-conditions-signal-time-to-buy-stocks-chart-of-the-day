Weakness in U.S. financial markets
has become extreme enough to signal a rebound that lifts stocks
out of a five-month slump, according to  Michael Shaoul , Oscar
Gruss & Son Inc.’s chief executive officer.  The CHART OF THE DAY displays the Bloomberg U.S. Financial
Conditions Index, a gauge that Shaoul cited yesterday as the
basis for his conclusion, in the top panel. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index is in the bottom panel.  The Bloomberg index’s low yesterday was minus 1.99, the
lowest level since June 2009. Readings of minus 2 or lower have
preceded stock-market reversals through most of the indicator’s
history, as Shaoul wrote in an e-mailed note. Calculations go
back to 1994.  “We have started to enter the climactic portion of this
particular correction,” the note said. The  S&P 500  has fallen
19 percent, near the 20 percent loss that commonly defines a
 bear market , since setting this year’s high on April 29.  “Stress elsewhere is already running far higher” than
Bloomberg’s index indicates, especially within the euro region,
he added. The Euro Stoxx Index crossed the 20 percent bear-
market threshold in August and has fallen as much as 32 percent
from this year’s peak on Feb. 18.  Most of the U.S. financial-conditions index’s value is
derived from money-market and bond-market indicators. Equity
gauges account for the rest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
