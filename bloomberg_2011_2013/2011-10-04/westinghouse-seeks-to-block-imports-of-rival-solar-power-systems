Westinghouse Solar Inc. said it filed
a patent-infringement complaint at the U.S. International Trade
Commission seeking to block imports of solar-power systems made
by Zep Solar and  Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ)   Westinghouse Solar, a designer and installer of solar-power
systems, accuses the companies of infringing two of its patents
that cover ways to make solar panels easier and cheaper to
install, the Campbell, California-based company said in a
statement today. A copy of the complaint wasn’t immediately
available.  The company has licensed its technology to Chinese and
Japanese firms, and it has been in talks with other companies
“in an effort to bring installation costs down on a more
widespread basis throughout the solar industry,” Westinghouse
Solar Chief Executive Officer Barry Cinnamon said in the
statement.  “Unfortunately, we believe that Zep Solar, Canadian Solar
and others have not appropriately recognized Westinghouse
Solar’s intellectual property rights by incorporating a system -
- the Zep System -- that we contend infringes certain of our
patents,” Cinnamon said. “As a consequence, we have turned to
the ITC to address this issue.”  Zep is based in  San Rafael , California, and Canadian Solar
is based in Kitchener, Ontario.  The ITC is an agency in  Washington  that investigates claims
of unfair trade practices and has the authority to ban imports
of products that violate U.S. patent rights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
