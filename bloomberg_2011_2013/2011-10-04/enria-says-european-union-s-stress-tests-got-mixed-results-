Andrea Enria, chairman of the
European Banking Authority, said the recent stress tests on
banks got “mixed results” because of concerns over sovereign
debt.  “We didn’t manage to reassure markets on the solidity of
European banks especially because of controversial treatment of
soveriegn exposures,” he said at the European Parliament in
Brussels today.  “The stress tests were a very difficult challenge for the
EBA. I think its fair to say we got mixed results,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
