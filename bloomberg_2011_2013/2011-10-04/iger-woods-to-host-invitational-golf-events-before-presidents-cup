Tiger Woods will host and play in two
invitational golf events in Australia as part of his
preparations for next month’s Presidents Cup.  Woods, who dropped out of the top 50 on the  Official World
Golf Ranking  yesterday for the first time since October 1996,
will play at Perth’s Burswood Golf Club on Nov. 5 and
Melbourne’s Capital Golf Club two days later, event organizer
 Crown Ltd. (CWN)  said in a statement.  U.S. Presidents Cup captain  Fred Couples , who chose Woods
as one of his two picks, had requested that the 14-time major
champion try and fit in more playing time before the U.S. takes
on an international squad of golfers from outside  Europe .  Woods, 35, was already scheduled to compete in the
Australian Open in Sydney from Nov. 10-13 before the Presidents
Cup, which starts Nov. 17 at Royal Melbourne Golf Club.  The 71-time winner on the U.S. PGA Tour missed almost four
months this season with Achilles tendon and knee injuries, and
has failed to win since November 2009.  Woods is scheduled to play this week at the Frys.com Open
at CordeValle Golf Club in San Martin,  California . It’s his
first tournament since he missed the halfway cut at the U.S.  PGA
Championship  in August, the only time he failed to play all four
rounds at the season’s final major championship.  Woods will be using caddie Joe LaCava for the first time
and is listed by Las Vegas oddsmakers as the  7-1 favorite  for
the Oct. 6-9 Fall Series tournament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
