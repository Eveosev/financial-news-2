Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  and
 Sands China Ltd. (1928)  declined for the third day in Hong Kong trading
after Macau posted the slowest casino revenue growth in eight
months.  Galaxy fell 5.8 percent to HK$8.87 at the 4 p.m. close on

revenue on its website. Sands  China  dropped 5.5 percent to
HK$15.10 after earlier gaining as much as 7.6 percent. The

slumping stock markets may damp demand for gambling.  Macau casino revenue is “poised to decelerate as the

Hui Miao. “Macau revenue growth may fall towards 10% in the
coming quarters.”  China has raised  interest rates  five times in the past 12
months to defuse the fastest gains in consumer prices since
2008, raising concern the pace of economic expansion will slow.  Wynn, MGM  Twelve percent of global investors in a Bloomberg poll last
