Treasuries dropped, pushing 30-year
bond yields up from the lowest level in more than two years, on
expectations that European Union officials may coordinate the
recapitalization of banks.  Benchmark 10-year note yields rose on a Financial Times
report after dropping yesterday the most in eight weeks. Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told lawmakers the central bank
is ready do more to boost the economy. The central bank bought
$4.59 billion of debt due from November 2019 to August 2021
under the program known as Operation Twist.  “People are looking for optimism anywhere they can get it
right now,” said Christopher Bury, co-head of fixed-income
rates at Jefferies Group Inc., one of the 22 primary dealers
that trade with the Fed. “You have these random stories, and
the market reacts.”  Yields on 30-year bonds increased eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 2.81 percent at 5:06 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.75 percent
securities due in August 2041 slid 1 25/32, or $17.81 per $1,000
face amount, to 119. The yields earlier today advanced 10 basis
points after touching 2.69 percent, the lowest since January
2009.  Gain in Stocks  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 2.3 percent after
earlier falling 2.2 percent. Crude oil for November delivery
erased its drop, rising 0.4 percent to $77.88 a barrel.  The report in the Financial Times quoted  Olli Rehn ,
European commissioner for economic affairs, as saying there is
an “increasingly shared view” that the region needs a
coordinated approach to halt the sovereign-debt crisis.  U.S. debt  securities pared their drop after  Italy  had its
government bond rating cut to A2 from Aa2 by Moody’s Investors
Service. The outlook is negative.  The 10-year note yields advanced seven basis points to 1.82
percent after falling 16 basis points yesterday, the most since
Aug. 8. Yields touched a record low 1.6714 percent on Sept. 23.
Two-year note yields were up two basis points to 0.25 percent.  The five-day relative strength index for 10-year note
yields dropped yesterday below 30 for the first time since Sept.
22, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A reading less than
that level indicates an asset may be poised for a change in
direction. The index rose today to 34.90.  Client Survey  A JPMorgan Chase & Co. client survey for the week ended
Oct. 3 showed 11 percent net longs on Treasuries, the highest
level since Dec. 6, 2010, according to the firm, a primary
dealer. The share of outright shorts was 2 percent, the lowest
since June 25, 2007. Neutrals totaled 85 percent, the same as in
the previous week.  Bernanke’s remarks before Congress’s Joint Economic
Committee signaled the Fed may not be finished after attempts to
bolster record monetary stimulus with unconventional tools.  The Fed “will continue to closely monitor economic
developments and is prepared to take further action as
appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context
of  price stability ,” Bernanke said.  Responding to a question, he said the central bank has no
immediate plans for another round of large-scale asset purchases
known as quantitative easing. At the same time, he said, the Fed
hasn’t taken “anything off the table.”  The central bank announced on Sept. 21 its plan to buy $400
billion of U.S. debt with maturities of six to 30 years through
June while selling an equal amount of securities due in three
years or less.  Payrolls Report  The U.S. added 58,000 jobs in September after zero growth
in the previous month, according to the median forecast of 84
economists in a Bloomberg News survey before the Labor
Department’s Oct. 7 payrolls report.  Government debt surged in the third quarter, led by 30-year
bonds on concern  Greece  is heading for a default and as the Fed
prepared to buy longer-term Treasuries to counter a slowdown in
the  U.S. economy .  The long bonds returned 31 percent, the most since the
depths of the financial crisis in December 2008, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes showed. The  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  tumbled 14
percent.  Yields on 30-year bonds decreased 146 basis points in the
third quarter, the most since falling 164 basis points in the
last three months of December 2008.  European Meeting  A seven-hour meeting of euro-area finance chiefs yesterday
produced an agreement to pursue “technical revisions” to a
July accord on private sector burden sharing, Luxembourg Prime
Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  told reporters today. He spoke of
“changes” to the Greek outlook that spurred the reassessment.  Juncker gave no details about a possible recalibration of
the “voluntary” debt exchange, the new element in the follow-
up package hammered out after last year’s 110 billion euro
lifeline failed to stabilize Greece.  The  Institute of International Finance , an industry group,
estimates that the debt swap, still being negotiated, will
amount to a writedown of 21 percent.  Ministers pushed back a decision on the release of Greece’s
next loan installment until after Oct. 13. It was the second
postponement of a vote originally slated for yesterday as part
of a lifeline granted last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
