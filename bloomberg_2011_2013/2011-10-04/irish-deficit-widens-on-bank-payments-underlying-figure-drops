 Ireland’s budget deficit widened in
the nine months through September from a year earlier due to
payments to recapitalize banks.   The deficit of 20.7 billion euros compared with a shortfall
of 13.4 billion euros, the   Finance Ministry  in Dublin said in a
statement on its website today. Tax revenue was 0.7 percent
above the government’s target.       The underlying deficit, excluding bank payments, was over 3
billion euros lower than the year earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
