Zain Group failed to sell a 25
percent stake in its Saudi unit because lenders refused to
transfer debt guarantees from Zain to purchasers,  Al Watan 
reported, citing Zain Saudi’s Chairman Prince Hussam al-Saud.  The Kuwaiti-operator is committed to restructuring Zain
Saudi’s capital and is willing to provide the money required for
the process, Saudi  Al-Watan  cited al-Saud as saying.  Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM) , controlled by Saudi billionaire Prince
Alwaleed bin Talal, and  Bahrain Telecom Co. (BATELCO)  said on Sept. 29
they won’t proceed with an offer to buy Zain’s 25 percent stake
in Zain  Saudi Arabia , the kingdom’s third-largest mobile-phone
company by market value, for $950 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
