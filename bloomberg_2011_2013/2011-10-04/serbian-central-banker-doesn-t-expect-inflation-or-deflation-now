Serbian Central Bank Governor Dejan
Soskic said expects inflation to be nonexistent or deflation in
the fourth quarter as prices are stable.  “Once we have single-digit inflation it will be easier to
steer lower inflationary expectations,” he said at a conference
today in Belgrade,  Serbia .  He also said that most risks are “behind us,” and pointed
out that unemployment is the biggest problem in the country for
now and can be fought only through a “substantial increase in
economic activity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
