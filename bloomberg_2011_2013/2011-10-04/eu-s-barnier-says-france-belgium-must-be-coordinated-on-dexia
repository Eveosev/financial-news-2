European Union Financial-Services
Commissioner  Michel Barnier  said France and Belgium must be
coordinated in their approach to  Dexia SA. (DEXB)   “Any speculation about a resolution of Dexia would be
premature, and I’m certainly not going to add to rumors and
speculation,” Barnier told a press conference today in
Luxembourg. “What’s important now is to be coordinated in our
approach between the French and Belgian governments in
particular,” he said.  “Dexia was one of the banks most affected by the crisis
because of its accumulated risks concerning its American
portfolio,” Barnier said. “The commission has monitored this
situation very carefully when applying the rules on state aid.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
