Western Canada Select and Syncrude
oil gained after  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  said it was working to restart
its Line 6B crude pipeline following a  power failure  at a pump
station late yesterday.  Repairs are under way and the pipeline, which has a
capacity of 283,100 barrels a day and runs from Griffith,
 Indiana , to Sarnia, Ontario, is may resume service today,
Lorraine Little, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed 50 cents to
$10 a barrel at 2:04 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The premium for Syncrude to West Texas Intermediate crude
strengthened 50 cents to $8.25 a barrel. Syncrude is a light,
low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in  Alberta .  Gulf crudes gained as the premium of Brent oil over WTI
widened. When Brent increases versus WTI, it strengthens the
value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African
oil priced against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 65 cents to
$27.40 a barrel. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium added $1.10 to
$26.60.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added 15 cents to $23.15 a barrel while Poseidon
strengthened 40 cents to $22.75 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium added 65 to $22.50 a barrel
and West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at 90 cents a
barrel below WTI. Thunder Horse’s premium increased $1 to $27
above the benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
