The 36-year-old stadium that houses
the  New Orleans Saints  and sheltered evacuees during  Hurricane
Katrina  will become the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, Louisiana
Governor  Bobby Jindal  said.  Financial terms of the 10-year agreement between Daimler
AG’s unit and the National Football League team weren’t
disclosed in a news release. Jindal said the Saints may receive
enough to end a state subsidy that after 2011 tops out at $6
million a year, according to the Louisiana Stadium and
Exposition District.  “This partnership agreement is estimated to significantly
reduce or eliminate taxpayer funding currently spent to support
the Saints,” Jindal said today in the release. “From a place
of last refuge in Hurricane Katrina to a facility where we
recently invested $85 million for improvements to help attract
corporate sponsorship from world-renowned Mercedes-Benz USA, the
Superdome is a symbol of our state’s success in not only
rebuilding, but building back better than ever.”  The Saints marketed the stadium’s naming rights as part of
a 15-year lease extension with the state, which recently
completed a six-year, $336 million renovation of the building.
The 2009 extension splits naming rights fees between the state
and team, after the Saints take the first $1 million, with the
state’s portion credited toward the subsidy.  The Superdome has hosted six Super Bowls, with another
scheduled for the stadium in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
