Canadian natural gas rose as
forecasters predicted a colder-than-normal winter in  North
America  that will boost demand for the heating fuel.  Prices, which usually follow their U.S. counterparts on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , gained 2.3 percent as Commodity
Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland , said heating needs in
November and December may rise to the highest level since 2000.  “It seems like a lot of people are getting more onside
with a colder-than-average winter, but I think it’s way too
early to say for sure,” Martin King, senior commodities analyst
with FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in Calgary, said in a telephone
interview. “I understand there’s still some stiff technical
resistance at $3.60.”  Alberta  gas for November delivery rose 7.5 cents to C$3.41
per gigajoule ($3.03 per million Btu) as of 3:15 p.m. New York
time, while December gas gained 7 cents to C$3.685, according to
 NGX,  a Canadian Internet market. Gas traded on the exchange is
shipped to users in  Canada  and the U.S. and is priced on
TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Gas for November delivery on the Nymex advanced 2.1 cents
to settle at $3.638 per million Btu.  Heating degree days, a measure of demand for heating fuels
during cold weather, are forecast to reach 11 percent higher
during November and December than the 10-year average,  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group, said in a
telephone interview. They may total 1,530 in November and
December, he said.  Heating Demand  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
declined 0.75 cent, or 0.2 percent, to $3.653 per million Btu on
the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that
can carry about 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from
western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas rose 0.94 cent, or 0.3 percent, to $3.4083,
according to ICE.  At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, gas advanced 0.47 cent to $3.4905 per
million Btu.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.4 billion cubic
feet, 645 million above the target, as of 2:45 p.m. New York
time.  Gas Flows  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.51 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.94 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 559 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.53 billion cubic feet today, about 73 percent of its
capacity of 2.09 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.8
billion cubic feet at 1:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
