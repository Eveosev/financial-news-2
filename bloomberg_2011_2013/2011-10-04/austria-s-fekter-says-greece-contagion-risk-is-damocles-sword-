Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said nobody can tell how big the contagion risk of a
Greek default would be and European policy makers were striving
to avoid finding out, according to the Austrian Press Agency.  “Nobody can tell how big the risk of contagion is that is
looming as Damocles’ sword,” Fekter was quoted as saying today
in Brussels. “Nobody can tell whether it will be worse than
Lehman or not,” she added, referring to the turmoil following
the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings in 2008.  “I’m not inclined to try to find out,” she said,
according to the newswire.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
