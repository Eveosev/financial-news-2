(Corrects investor’s comment in fourth paragraph to show
yields are rising.)  Yields on most Brazilian interest-
rate futures contracts rose on speculation the central bank
won’t cut  interest rates  as aggressively as it did after the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  Yields on the futures contract due in January 2013 rose 17
basis points, or 0.17 percentage point, to 10.31 percent at 8:54
a.m. in  New York .  Policy makers aren’t aiming to bring the benchmark rate to
9 percent next year at the urging of President  Dilma Rousseff ,
said a government official familiar with monetary policy who
asked not to be identified because he isn’t authorized to
discuss the matter. Moderate rate cuts are more appropriate
because policy makers are acting quickly and don’t expect the
European debt crisis to be as deep as the 2008 global credit
crunch, the official told Bloomberg News.  “The only reason I see the yields rising today is this
news,” Jorge Dib, portfolio manager at Grau Gestao de Ativos in
 Sao Paulo , said in a telephone interview. “Yesterday the market
wanted to embrace this bet on a 75 basis-point cut but today’s
it’s stepping back a little.”  The real weakened 0.1 percent to 1.8932 per dollar, from
1.8911 yesterday.  -- With assistance from Andre Soliani in Brasilia. Editors:
