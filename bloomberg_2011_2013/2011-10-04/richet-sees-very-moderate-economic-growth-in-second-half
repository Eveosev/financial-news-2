European Central Bank President Jean-
Claude Trichet said he expects moderate economic growth in the
17-nation currency bloc.  “We expect real GDP growth in the euro area to be very
moderate in the second half of the year,” Trichet said in a
parliamentary hearing in Brussels today. He said that growth
prospects are burdened by slowing global growth rates and
financial market tensions and added that risks to the growth
outlook are “on the downside.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
