Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
forecast for earnings growth in  Asia  excluding  Japan  after
lowering its outlook for global economic expansion.  Per-share earnings may grow 10 percent this year and
increase 7 percent next year, lower than an earlier prediction
of 11 percent growth for both years, Goldman Sachs analysts led
by Timothy Moe wrote in a report today. The brokerage cut its
global 2012 gross domestic product forecast to 3.5 percent from
4.2 percent.  Asia excluding Japan stocks face “downside risk” of 10
percent to 15 percent, the analysts wrote. They cut their 12-
month forecast for the MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index
to 480 from 530, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
