Barclays Plc (BARC)  and  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  said they welcomed the time available to
implement recommendations made by the U.K. government-sponsored
 Independent Commission on Banking .  “The ICB timeline for implementation, which runs until
2019, is also critical for banks to accommodate the changes
while continuing to support the economy,” Barclays’s Chief
Executive Officer  Robert Diamond  said in a speech to a Bank of
America Corp. conference in London today.  The proposals, which included a separation of banks’ retail
businesses from their riskier investment banking operations,
must be approved by Parliament. U.K. banks are struggling with
declining revenue and the threat of losses related to the
European sovereign debt crisis, which is raising the cost of
borrowing in the wholesale money markets. The plan is to be
implemented by 2019 under the commission’s proposed schedule.  RBS CEO Stephen Hester said flexibility on the proposed
firebreak system and long lead time is “helpful” in a speech
at the same event.  “Lead time and some ring-fence flexibility is helpful,”
Hester said in the presentation. It gives us “enough time to
adjust,” he said.  Diamond said there was still the possibility the rules
could be enforced in a harsher manner than described, and urged
shareholders and bondholders in U.K. banks to “share their
views with the U.K. authorities at this stage in the process.”  He reiterated the lender’s target return on equity of 13
percent by 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
