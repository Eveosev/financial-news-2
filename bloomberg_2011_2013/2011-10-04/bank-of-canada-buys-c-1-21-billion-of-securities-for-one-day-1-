The  Bank of Canada  made C$1.21
billion ($1.14 billion) in one-day purchases of securities,
under a program that aims to keep overnight lending rates close
to its 1 percent target.  Earlier, the central bank said it had purchased C$750
million under the program. Today’s total is similar to
yesterday’s C$1.215 billion of transactions.  The Ottawa-based bank also also said it made C$111 million
in one-day loans of securities under a separate program that
aims to boost the supply of  government bonds  and treasury bills
in the market when demand is high.  The bank also increased the amount of settlement balances
in the Large Value Transfer System to C$1.132 billion from the
regular daily target of C$25 million. The funds are used to help
settle payments between banks and brokers, and a higher amount
can also encourage lower  interest rates  on interbank loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
