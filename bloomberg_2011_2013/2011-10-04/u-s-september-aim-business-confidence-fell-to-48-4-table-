Business confidence in the  U.S.
economy  declined last month, according to the Associated
Industries of Massachusetts’ survey of regional firms.  The AIM business confidence index for Sept. fell to 48.4
from 49.2 the previous month. The index measures confidence
in the U.S. economy among employers in Massachusetts. A
reading above 50 means more of the region’s firms anticipate
improving U.S. business conditions.  Following is a table compiled from the September AIM
business confidence survey:  SOURCE: Associated Industries of  Massachusetts     http://www.aimnet.org   To contact the reporter on this story:
