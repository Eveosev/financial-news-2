Lebanon’s  Finance Ministry  said next
year’s budget will increase value-added tax and income from
financial and real-estate investments and boost current
expenditures by 13 percent.  The budget forecasts a fiscal deficit of 8.1 percent of
gross domestic product for 2012, down from a projected 9.4
percent this year, the ministry said in an e-mailed statement
from Beirut today. VAT will rise to 12 percent from 10 percent,
and taxes on interest from  bank deposits  to 8 percent from 5
percent, the ministry said. It will also introduce a capital-
gains tax of 3 percent on real estate sales.  The budget is a revision of a draft issued in May by the
previous government. It retains that plan’s 4 percent economic
growth rate forecast for next year. The  International Monetary
Fund  expects Lebanon’s economy to grow 1.5 percent this year,
the  slowest since 2006 , accelerating to 3.5 percent in 2012. The
economy has been hit by the domestic political tensions that
toppled former Prime Minister  Saad Hariri ’s administration in
January, and political unrest in neighboring  Syria .  “The tax increases come at a very inopportune time,” said
 Nassib Ghobril , chief economist at Beirut-based Byblos Bank SAL.
“The rise in VAT will slow down consumption in an already
subdued economic environment, which will negatively impact tax
revenues, while the rise in the tax on interest deposits will
hurt those who rely on this source of income for their spending,
such as retirees.”  The budget, which needs to be approved by the Cabinet
before it is debated and voted on by parliament, estimates
inflation at 5 percent next year.  Lebanon’s public debt reached about $52.6 billion at the
end of last year, equivalent to about 137 percent of gross
domestic product. The budget forecasts it to drop to 135 percent
at the end of this year and 132 percent in 2012. The country ran
up debt on rebuilding after the  15-year civil war  that ended in
1990 and an Israeli bombing campaign in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
