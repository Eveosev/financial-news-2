The prospect of a recession in  Europe 
next year is growing as turmoil in financial markets and a
slowing  U.S. economy  curbs growth in the region,  Standard &
Poor’s  said in a report.  Economic expansion in the euro region will slow to 1.1
percent in 2012, S&P forecast in a report today, down from an
August forecast of 1.5 percent. The forecast for the U.K. growth
rate was cut to 1.7 percent from 1.8 percent.  “The prospect that Europe might dip into recession again
is looking more likely,” Jean-Michel Six, S&P’s chief economist
for Europe wrote. “We still do not expect a genuine double dip
to occur in the eurozone as a whole or in the U.K., but we
recognize that the probability of another recession in western
Europe has continued to grow.”  The likelihood of a recession next year is 40 percent, the
report said, as surveys show a slowdown in manufacturing and
service sectors since the second quarter is combining with a
worsening European debt crisis and slowing U.S. economy. Lower-
than-expected growth in emerging markets or a rise in long-term
interest rates will make a recession more likely, S&P said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
