Dexia SA (DEXB)  “has a business model which
in terms of liquidity is quite stressed,” said Andrea Enria,
chairman of the European Banking Authority.  The treatment of sovereign debt in the recent stress tests
explains why its problems were not revealed, he said at the
European Parliament in Brussels today.  “Changing the treatment” of sovereign debt “would cater
for these events going forward,” he said, referring to the
stress tests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
