Former executives of
Novacaixagalicia, the savings bank that received a 2.5 billion-
euro ($3.3 billion) bail out from  Spain  last week, face an
investigation over million of euros in payments they received on
leaving the lender, Cinco Dias reported.  The new management, headed by Chairman Jose Maria
Castellano, will examine the payments after Novacaixagalicia was
taken over by Spainâ€™s bank rescue fund last week, the newspaper
reported, citing people familiar with the process.  Former managing director Jose Luis Pego was paid about 8
million euros in pension contributions and compensation when he
left the bank in September while Javier Garcia Paredes and Oscar
Rodriguez, who served as deputy managing directors, received
about 7 million euros, the newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
