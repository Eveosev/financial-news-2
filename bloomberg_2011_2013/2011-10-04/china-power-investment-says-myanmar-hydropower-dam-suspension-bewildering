China Power Investment Corp. , an
investor in Myanmar’s $3.6 billion Myitsone hydropower station,
said the country’s sudden decision to halt the project is
“bewildering,” according to the official Xinhua News Agency.  All legal documents and regulatory procedures have been
cleared, Xinhua reported yesterday, citing Lu Qizhou, president
of  China  Power Investment. A halt to construction will lead to
“a series of legal issues,” Lu was cited as saying.  Myanmar President Thein Sein said on Sept. 30 the project
on the Irrawaddy River should be suspended because it’s against
the “will of the people,” according to the  Associated Press .
China, which also has oil and gas investments in the Southeast
Asian nation, said the rights of Chinese companies ought to be
respected and called for “friendly talks.”  The European Union welcomes Myanmar’s readiness to address
the ecological concerns about the project and the government’s
willingness to listen to “diverse voices,” according to a
statement on Sept. 30. Last year, China, Myanmar and  Thailand 
agreed to study a $10 billion hydropower project on the Salween
River that discharges into the Andaman Sea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
