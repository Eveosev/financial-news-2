An expansion of the euro area’s
rescue fund through leveraging may be necessary, Slovak Finance
Minister Ivan Miklos said today in the capital Bratislava.  Any default in the 17-member euro region must be
coordinated, Miklos said at a budget committee meeting, adding
he prefers bank recapitalization from national sources.  Slovakia’s ruling coalition still lacks an agreement on
approving the mechanism, Miklos said. The government will meet
on the issue later today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
