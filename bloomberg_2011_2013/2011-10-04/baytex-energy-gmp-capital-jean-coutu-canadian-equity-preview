Canadian stocks fell for a third day
as financial companies dropped on speculation the European Union
will require bondholders to face bigger losses on Greek debt and
gold and silver retreated.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s largest lender by
assets, declined 1.8 percent after Deutsche Bank AG scrapped its
own profit forecast.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s biggest
gold producer, decreased 3 percent as the metal slipped the most
in a week.  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM) , Canada’s second-largest
publicly traded copper producer, jumped 11 percent as base-
metals and coal producers rallied the most since May 2009.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index dropped 73.93
points, or 0.7 percent, to 11,177.91 after closing at the lowest
since July 2010 yesterday.  “ Europe  has some very difficult decisions to make, and the
more they sit on their hands, the more difficult it’s going to
get for the debt markets, the  currency markets  and, ultimately,
the financial sector,” Arthur Salzer, the chief executive
officer of Northland Wealth Management in Toronto, said in a
telephone interview. The firm oversees about C$200 million ($188
million).  Canada ’s stock benchmark tumbled 13 percent in the third
quarter, the most since 2008, and declined in September for the
seventh-straight month, the longest streak since 1984. The
S&P/TSX sank 21 percent from April 5 through yesterday, meeting
a common definition of a  bear market . The index has plunged with
world equities on concern about a potential Greek debt default
and a slowdown in the global economic recovery.  Decision Delayed  European markets led losses in world stocks today as
finance ministers meeting in Luxembourg considered revising a
July agreement that would have investors contribute 50 billion
euros ($66 billion) to a 159 billion-euro rescue of  Greece . The
EU officials pushed back a decision on the release of an 8
billion-euro payment to Greece until after Oct. 13.  Deutsche Bank said it would cut 500 jobs due in part to the
continent’s debt crisis. France and  Belgium  pledged to support
Dexia SA as shares of the Brussels-based lender touched a record
low on concern it will require a second government bailout.  Thirty-nine of 43 S&P/TSX financial companies retreated.
Royal Bank lost 1.8 percent to C$45.95.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ,
its biggest domestic rival, slid 0.7 percent to C$71.14.  Bank of
Nova Scotia (BNS) , Canada’s third-largest lender by assets, decreased
1.8 percent to C$50.20.  Gold Shares  Gold and silver futures retreated as some investors sold
the metals to cover losses in other assets.  Barrick lost 3 percent to C$47.14.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the
world’s second-largest gold producer by market value, decreased
3.8 percent to C$45.94.  Silver Wheaton Corp. (SLW) , Canada’s fourth-
largest precious-metals company by market value, sank 5.5
percent to C$29.04.  B2Gold Corp. (BTO) , which explores in  Latin
America , slumped 11 percent, the most since July 2009, to
C$3.35.  Richmont Mines Inc. (RIC) , which produces gold in Canada, tumbled
18 percent, the most since January 2008, to C$8.98 after Tara Hassan, an analyst at  National Bank of Canada , cut her rating on
the company to “sector perform” from “outperform.”  Base-metals and coal producers in the S&P/TSX rebounded
after closing at the lowest relative to forecast earnings since
January 2009 yesterday. Industrial-metals prices are likely to
rebound next year, Ralph Profiti, an analyst at Credit Suisse
Group AG, said in a note to clients today. Profiti named First
Quantum,  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B)  and  Inmet Mining Corp. (IMN) 
“preferred” stocks.  Fundamentally ‘Solid’  Investors had lost track of the supply and demand of
industrial metals in their concern about a possible recession,
David Sherlock, a  money manager  at McLean & Partners in Calgary,
said in a telephone interview. The firm oversees C$1 billion.
“The fundamental balance sheets and earnings of these companies
are solid,” he said.  Teck, Canada’s largest company in the industry, gained 8
percent to C$30.99. First Quantum increased 11 percent, the most
since April 2009, to C$14.68. Inmet, a copper and zinc producer
advanced 10 percent, the most since May 2009, to C$45.92 after
saying it expects to meet its production forecast for its Cobre
Las Cruces mine in  Spain .  SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. (SNC) , Canada’s largest engineering and
construction company, fell 5.4 percent to C$40, the lowest since
July 2009, after saying it will buy Derby, England-based
railroad consultant Interfleet Technology Ltd.  U.S. Regulation  Pharmacy-benefits provider  SXC Health Solutions Corp. (SXC)  lost
6.2 percent to C$51.21, extending its two-day retreat to 12
percent. U.S. regulators proposed a rule yesterday to require
companies in the industry to disclose the markup they charge
insurers for prescription medicines.  Propane distributor  Superior Plus Corp. (SPB)  declined 5.4
percent to C$6.18 and increasing its five-day loss to 33
percent. The shares have tumbled on investor concern the company
may cut its dividend, Paul Bloom, the manager of the C$218.1
million Blue Ribbon Income Fund, said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
