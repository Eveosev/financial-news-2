Andrea Enria, chairman of the
European Banking Authority, said the agency will discuss the
situation at  Dexia SA (DEXB)  in a confidential meeting tomorrow.  It’s important that Dexia’s funding problems are fixed as
soon as possible otherwise they “could spread to other banks,”
he said at the European Parliament in Brussels today. He said
the meeting will discuss plans of French and Belgian regulators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
