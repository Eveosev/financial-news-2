Gulf Coast  gasoline rose to the
highest level in a month as Pasadena Refining System Inc., a
unit of  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , investigated the cause of a
Sept. 30 fire on a crude unit.  The company is determining how long the crude unit will be
shut, Ciro Ribeiro, a Petrobras spokesman, said in an e-mail.
The Pasadena, Texas, plant can process 106,500 barrels of crude
a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The coker, the utilities and the S Zorb units are in
operation at this time,” Ribeiro said. An S Zorb unit reduces
the sulfur levels in gasoline.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline on the
Gulf Coast rose 2.12 cents to 4.25 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 1:04 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the highest level
since Sept. 1. Prompt delivery gained 2.32 cents to $2.5555 a
gallon.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the Gulf strengthened 0.38 cent
to 3.88 cents over heating oil futures.  PBF Energy Partners LP reported emissions at its Delaware
City, Delaware, refinery after a malfunction at a hydrogen
purification system yesterday, according to a filing with state
regulators.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor rose 1 cent to 10.25 cents a gallon, the highest
level since Sept. 14.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Chicago held at a
premium of 6.88 cents a gallon versus futures.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  started its Ozark oil pipeline in  Illinois 
today after it was shut Sept. 30.  The Ozark line, which runs 435 miles (700 kilometers) from
Cushing,  Oklahoma , to Wood River, Illinois, was shut after an
underwater survey found a 110-foot segment of the line had been
exposed at a Mississippi River crossing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
