Peru’s sol fell to a one-week low as
copper prices dropped on concern  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis
will slow the world economy and reduce demand for the metal.  The sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.7775 per U.S. dollar at
1:31 p.m. New York time, from 2.7745 yesterday.  Copper extended the longest slump in almost two months
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its global growth forecast
for this year and next and predicted mild recessions in Germany
and France. European governments signaled bondholders may have
to take bigger losses on Greek debt than previously negotiated.
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank
stands ready to take additional steps to boost U.S. growth.  “Chile is more sensitive to the copper price as  Peru ’s
metal output is more diversified, but both countries are very
dependent on metal prices,” said Gonzalo Navarro, the head
trader at  Banco Santander  in Lima.  Peru is the world’s third-largest copper producer after
Chile and China, number two in silver and sixth in gold. Metals
account for two-thirds of Peru’s exports.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 5.95 percent, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
