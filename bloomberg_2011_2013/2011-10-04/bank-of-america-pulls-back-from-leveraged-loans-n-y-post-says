Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  is curtailing
its leveraged-loan business until it can get rid of a backlog of
such loans, the New York Post reported, citing two unidentified
private-equity managers.  The bank helped underwrite several leveraged financing
deals, often used for private-equity acquisitions, in July and
August at levels that made it hard to resell them as credit
markets tightened, the newspaper said.  Bank of America, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley have
until early next month to resell $4.7 billion in loans used to
finance Apax Partners acquisition of medical device maker
Kinetic Concepts, the newspaper said.  The banks may have to sell the debt at a discount of from
$235 million to $470 million, the Post said. Bank of America
holds 28 percent of the loans and may have leveraged-loan losses
of more than $150 million, the newspaper added.  Bank of America, which earns about $2 billion from
leveraged loans, was recently absent from Carlyleâ€™s $3.9 billion
acqusition of medical company  Pharmaceutical Product Development
Inc. (PPDI)  financed by Credit Suisse AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS
AG, the Post said.  Bank of America and JPMorgan representatives declined to
comment, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
