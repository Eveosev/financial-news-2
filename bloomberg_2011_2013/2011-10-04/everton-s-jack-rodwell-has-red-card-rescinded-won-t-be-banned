The red card shown to Everton’s Jack
Rodwell during last weekend’s game with Liverpool has been
rescinded and the midfielder won’t have to serve a three-match
suspension, the Football Association said.  Rodwell was sent off by referee  Martin Atkinson  for a
challenge on  Luis Suarez  in the 23rd minute of Liverpool’s 2-0
win three days ago. Television replays showed the play didn’t
appear to be dangerous.  Everton made a claim of wrongful dismissal with the F.A.,
which the governing body today upheld. That means the automatic
ban for serious foul play has been withdrawn, the F.A. said on
its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
