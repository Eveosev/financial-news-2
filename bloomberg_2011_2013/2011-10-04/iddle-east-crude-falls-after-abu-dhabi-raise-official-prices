Crude oil from the  Middle East  for
sale to  Asia  fell as  Abu Dhabi  raised its official prices,
damping demand from refiners.  Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., for loading
in November dropped 15 cents to a premium of 13 cents a barrel
to its official selling price, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Lower Zakum, also produced in the emirate, declined
14 cents to a premium of 11 cents a barrel, Bloomberg data
showed.  Abu Dhabi National, or Adnoc, raised its official price for
Murban to $110.90 a barrel for September, according to an e-
mailed statement today. That raised the gradeâ€™s premium to
benchmark Dubai crude for the same period to $4.59 a barrel, the
most since May and the third-highest in the past two years,
according to Bloomberg calculations. The August price difference
was $4.03.  Dubai swaps for December widened to a premium of 72 cents a
barrel today over January from 54 cents yesterday, according to
data from London-based brokers PVM Oil Associates Ltd.  Oman crude for immediate loading dropped $1.37, or 1.4
percent, to $96.61 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for loading in December fell 1.4 percent to $96.03. Murban for
spot delivery slid 1.5 percent to $100.19.  Oman futures for December delivery fell 36 cents to $97.49
a barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 5:01 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,172 contracts traded. The settlement price was
$97.24 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The November Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
widened 4 cents to $5.35 a barrel, according to data from PVM.
The exchange for swaps for December rose 17 cents to $4.02.  To contact the reporter on this story:
