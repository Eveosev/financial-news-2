The restaurant performance index fell 
in August, according to the National Restaurant Association.  The index weakened to 99.4 in August from 99.7 a month earlier.
The index is a statistical barometer that measures the overall health 
of the U.S. Restaurant Industry.  A value above 100 signals a period
of expansion while a value under 100 signals a period of contraction.  Note: The index is composed of two equally weighted components: 
the Current Situation Index and the Expectations Index.
The monthly composite index is based on the responses to the National
Restaurant Associationâ€™s monthly Resturant Industry Tracking Survey, 
which is fielded among restaurant operators nationwide on indicators 
including sales, traffic, labor, and  capital expenditures .  To contact the reporter on this story:
