The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and share prices are as of 12:05 p.m. New York time.  The Merval Index retreated 2 percent to 2,244.89.  Banco Hipotecario SA (BHIP)   fell 7.8 percent to 1.42
pesos, the most in almost two weeks. The price of Argentine
sovereign bonds declined today, which signals lower value for
banks’ fixed income holdings.  Mirgor SACIFIA (MIRG AF) slumped 8 percent to 69 pesos, its
lowest price in almost a year. The Argentine auto parts
manufacturer led losses among members of the Merval benchmark
index, in line with global equity markets which fell on concern
that European policy makers may renegotiate terms of  Greece ’s
bailout, deepening concern about the impact of the debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
