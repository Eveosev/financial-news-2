Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk
said today that he sees “no reason” for the government to
change its economic growth forecasts in the 2012 draft budget.  The government’s budget deficit for this year will be
“clearly” narrower than the 40.2 billion-zloty budget limit,
meaning that  Poland ’s fiscal consolidation plans are on track
and don’t need amending, Tusk told reporters at a press
conference in Warsaw.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
