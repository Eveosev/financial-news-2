Steven Maijoor, chairman of the
European Securities and Markets Authority, said the agency will
manage inspections at credit ratings companies registered in the
region.  “We’re looking forward to starting our inspections; we can
only start when they are registered,” he said at the European
Parliament in Brussels today. The checks will include the way
the companies conduct ratings of sovereign debt.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
