Notes sold by  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  less
than a week ago fell after  Germany ’s biggest lender abandoned
its 2011 profit forecast.  The bank’s floating-rate notes due 2013 fell 0.09 cents to
99.66 cents on the euro, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices at 2:30 p.m. in  London . The 1.5 billion-euro ($2 billion)
issue priced at 99.743 when it went on sale Sept. 29 and was the
first public offering of unsecured bank debt in two months.  Deutsche Bank said today its 10 billion-euro pretax target
for 2011 won’t be met as  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis hurts
revenue. European banks’ access to bond markets has been
restricted amid investor concerns about the losses lenders may
incur from their holdings of Greek and other indebted euro-
nation debt.  “It isn’t very investor-friendly to raise cash in the bond
markets and then announce a profit warning just three business
days later,” said Serafi Rodriguez, a fixed-income trader at
Banc Internacional d’Andorra. “If they had done it the other
way around, the pricing of the deal would probably have been
significantly different.”  Deutsche Bank’s note sale last week was the first public
benchmark-sized senior unsecured deal from a European bank since
UniCredit SpA issued floating-rate securities on July 13. ABN
Amro NV in Amsterdam followed Deutsche Bank with an unsecured
note offering on Sept. 30.  Credit-default swaps on the senior debt of Deutsche Bank
climbed 19 basis points to 210, the highest since Sept. 23,
according to CMA prices. An increase in the price of the debt-
insurance contracts indicates deterioration in the perception of
 credit quality .  Christoph Blumenthal, a Deutsche Bank spokesman in London,
