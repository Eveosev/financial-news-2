Serbia’s state institutions will
start paying their contractors within 60 days of receiving goods
or services, as part of efforts to improve liquidity and end a
“vicious cycle of debt,”  Politika  newspaper reported, citing
Deputy Finance Minister Dusan Nikezic.  A government decree on the issue is expected in about 10
days, will lead to immediate payments of 4.5 billion dinars
($58.3 million), which will not undermine the budget, the report
quoted Nikezic as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
