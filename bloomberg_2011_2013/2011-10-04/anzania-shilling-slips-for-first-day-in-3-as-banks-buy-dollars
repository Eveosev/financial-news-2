Tanzania’s shilling depreciated for
the first day in three against as banks bought the U.S.
currency, anticipating demand for dollars will increase.  The currency of  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy lost
0.9 percent to 1,670 per dollar by 11:55 a.m in Dar es Salaam,
the commercial capital.  “It is banks that are trading today mainly in anticipation
of demand for the dollar coming through in a couple of days,”
Zainul Chandoo, head treasurer at Stanbic Bank Tanzania Ltd.,
Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s local unit, said by phone from Dar es
Salaam. “We expect demand for the dollar to come from oil,
telecoms and power sectors.”  Tanzania’s inflation rate climbed to 14.1 percent in August
on higher energy and food costs, the National Bureau of
Statistics said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
