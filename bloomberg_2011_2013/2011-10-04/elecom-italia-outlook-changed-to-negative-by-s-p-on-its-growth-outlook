Telecom Italia SpA (TIT)  had its debt
outlook revised to “negative” from “stable” by  Standard &
Poor’s , which cut its growth expectations for Italy’s biggest
phone company in the domestic market.  S&P also lowered the company’s short-term rating to “A-3”
from “A-2” and affirmed its “BBB” long-term rating on the
Milan-based company, according to a statement today. That’s the
second-lowest investment grade.  “The negative outlook reflects the risk that the current
adverse economic environment in Italy could reduce TI’s
revenues, EBITDA, and free cash flow, thereby constraining its
deleveraging,” S&P said in the statement.  On Sept. 7, Moody’s Investors Service changed its outlook
on Telecom Italia’s Baa2 senior unsecured and issuer credit
ratings to “negative” from “stable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
