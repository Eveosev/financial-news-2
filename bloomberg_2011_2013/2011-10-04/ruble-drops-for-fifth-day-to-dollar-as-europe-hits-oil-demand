The ruble depreciated against the
dollar for a fifth day, heading for the weakest close in more
than two years, on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will hurt demand
for oil, Russia’s chief export earner.  Russia’s currency depreciated 0.4 percent to 32.715 per
dollar at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, its weakest closing
position since July 2009. It was 0.4 percent weaker at 43.4722
per euro, leaving it also down 0.4 percent at 37.56 against the
central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Crude futures dropped for a third day in  New York , losing
0.9 percent to $76.85 per barrel, as European leaders indicated
that investors may have to take bigger losses than previously
assumed on Greek debt and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
growth forecast for  Japan . Urals crude, the main Russian blend,
closed below $100 a barrel yesterday for the first time since
Feb. 15.  “ Russia  remains an oil play, and with commodity prices
vulnerable we see further weakness ahead for the ruble,”  Win Thin , the global head of emerging-markets currency strategy at
Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York, wrote in an e-mailed
research note.  Investors increased bets the ruble will depreciate further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing it dropping to 33.3402 per
dollar in three months’ time, compared with 33.1485 yesterday.
