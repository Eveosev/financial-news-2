Walt Disney Co. (DIS) , which generated more
than $79 million in U.S. theaters after converting “The  Lion
King ” to 3-D, will re-release four other animated features in
the format.  “Beauty and the Beast” will be reissued on Jan. 13 next
year, followed by “Finding Nemo” on Sept. 14, the Burbank,
California-based company said today in an e-mail. “Monsters
Inc.” will be reissued in January 2013, and “The Little
Mermaid” will follow in September of that year.  “This is just pure gravy for Disney,” said Wade Holden,
an analyst with the consulting firm SNL Kagan in Monterey,
 California . “Disney puts their films back in their vault, and
then re-issues them a few years later for the next generation
anyway.”  The 3-D conversions also help DVD sales by elevating the
profile of the films, Holden added. Disney released “The Lion
King” on DVD and Blu-Ray today. The three-dimensional version
of the film opened in theaters on Sept. 16.  Disney rose 86 cents to $29.86 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 20
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
