Air Liquide SA (AI)  Chief Executive
Officer Benoit Potier said demand for hydrogen used in fuel
cells will probably rise as carmakers such as  Daimler AG (DAI)  and
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  introduce models powered by the technology.  A global automotive market share of 1 percent for fuel-
cell-powered cars would represent 15 billion euros ($19.8
billion) in sales for the industrial-gas industry, Potier told
journalists today near Paris.  “Daimler, Opel, Toyota and Honda have announced launches
on the market around 2015,” Potier said. “The U.S., Canada,
Japan,  South Korea  and  China  have started refueling-station
infrastructure programs, and Germany has taken a very strong
lead in Europe.”  Air Liquide, the world’s biggest producer of industrial
gases, generated 1.4 billion euros in hydrogen sales in 2010,
mostly to oil refiners and chemicals producers, Potier said. Of
that amount, only “a few million euros” came from hydrogen
sales to users of fuel cells to power forklift trucks, buses and
remote mobile-phone antennas.  Cars powered by fuel cells, which produce electricity
through a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, will
become more attractive because the vehicles can travel more than
500 kilometers (310 miles) between refuelings, which take three
minutes, compared with several hours to recharge battery-powered
cars with shorter ranges, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
