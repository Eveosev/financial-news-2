U.K. stocks rallied, snapping a five-
day slump on the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX) , amid speculation
policy makers are examining measures to shield banks from the
sovereign-debt crisis.  Rio Tinto  Group climbed 7.1 percent as shares of raw
material producers helped European stocks higher.  J Sainsbury
Plc (SBRY) , the U.K.’s third-biggest supermarket company, rose 3.6
percent after saying it maintained sales growth in the second
quarter.  The FTSE 100 Index advanced 157.73 points, or 3.2 percent,
to 5,102.17 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London . The FTSE All-Share
Index gained 2.9 percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index rose 2.2
percent.  Markets rallied “on reports that European finance
ministers were examining ways of co-ordinating large scale
recapitalizations of banks on a local level in an attempt to
convince markets that governments would do all they could to
safeguard and support the European banking sector,” said
 Michael Hewson , a markets analyst at CMC Markets in London.  The FTSE 100 yesterday closed below 5,000 for the first
time since July 2010, as policy makers failed to reassure
investors they can contain the European debt crisis. The gauge
lost 14 percent in the third quarter, its biggest drop since
2002, amid concern that Greece’s debt woes will spread to other
countries in the region and that the euro area’s economy is
stalling.  The  Bank of England  should consider easing monetary policy
if the outlook for the economy deteriorates further, the
 International Monetary Fund  said. The IMF cut its 2011 and 2012
U.K. growth forecasts last month as threats from  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis weigh on the economy.  U.S. Services  Stocks extended gains after a gauge of U.S. service
industries topped estimates, tempering concern about a slowdown
in the world’s largest economy.  Rio Tinto advanced 7.1 percent to 2,905.5 pence.  Xstrata
Plc (XTA)  rose 7.1 percent to 818.2 pence, both after five days of
declines. A gauge of miners in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index was
the second-best performer among the gauge’s 19 industry groups.  Sainsbury climbed 3.6 percent to 284.6 pence after saying
sales for the second quarter excluding petrol and including
value added tax, rose 1.9 percent. It thus maintained its sales
growth in the second quarter and increased its share in the U.K.
grocery market.  North Sea Deal  EnCore Oil Plc (EO/)  rallied 64 percent to 74 pence, the most
since June 2010, as Premier Oil Plc, a London-based oil
explorer, agreed to buy EnCore for 221 million pounds ($340
million) to add reserves and production in the North Sea.  BTG Plc surged 11 percent to 265 pence as the specialist
drugmaker said 2012 sales may beat analysts’ estimates, helped
by new treatments and the withdrawal of a rival’s product.  Grainger Plc gained 11 percent to 86 pence as the U.K.’s
largest publicly traded residential landlord reached loan
agreements that extend the maturity of its debt.  Supergroup Plc (SGP)  slumped 30 percent to 707 pence, its biggest
fall ever, after saying profit will decline by as much as 9
million pounds this year due to problems with its warehouse
system. The company said that an upgrade at its Barnwood site
caused a “significant, temporary reduction both in the amount
of stock and range of sizes reaching its U.K. stores.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
