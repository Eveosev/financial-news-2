Manhattan  apartment sales jumped in
the third quarter, buoyed by deals at the high and low ends of
the market, as foreign investors drove demand for condos and
entry-level buyers took advantage of record-low  mortgage rates .  Purchases of condos and co-ops rose 17 percent from a year
earlier to 3,106, New York appraiser  Miller Samuel Inc.  and
broker  Prudential Douglas Elliman  Real Estate said in a report
today. That was the highest volume since the third quarter of
2007. The median sales price was $911,333, little changed from
$914,000 in the same period of 2010.  New York real estate demand is holding up as a broader
economic slowdown provides an opportunity to enter the market.
Buyers from  China ,  Korea ,  South America  and  Europe  fueled a 33
percent increase in condo transactions in the quarter, said
 Jonathan Miller , president of Miller Samuel. Studios and one-
bedroom units accounted for more than half of all deals, a sign
of demand from first-time purchasers, he said.  “You have strength at the low end and the upper end,”
Miller said in a telephone interview. “They’re benefitting from
what’s going on globally: low interest rates and the weak
dollar. The middle is restrained largely because of elevated
unemployment and tight underwriting.”  The  U.S. dollar  declined against all of the world’s 16
most-traded currencies in the 12 months through August before
rallying last month. The average rate for a 30-year fixed
mortgage fell to 4.01 percent last week, the lowest in Freddie
Mac records dating to 1971, after the  Federal Reserve  announced
a debt-buying plan aimed at lowering borrowing costs and
bolstering the economy.  Safe Investment  Buyers see New York real estate as a safe investment,
Miller said. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index tumbled 14 percent
last quarter, the worst performance since the end of 2008, as
concern increased that Europe’s debt crisis will trigger a
global recession and the Fed said there are “significant
downside risks” to the  U.S. economy .  Condo transactions, which foreign buyers tend to favor,
rose to 1,789 units from 1,341 a year earlier. Sales of co-ops
were little changed at 1,317 from 1,320 a year earlier.  Four other reports today also showed rising apartment sales
and lower prices. The  Corcoran Group  said purchases of condos
and co-ops climbed 15 percent from a year earlier to 3,750. The
median price declined 2 percent to $855,000.  ‘Relative Bargain’  Brokerage  Brown Harris Stevens  and its sister firm,
 Halstead Property LLC , reported sales rose 1 percent, while the
median price fell 4 percent to about $850,000.  StreetEasy.com , a
service that compiles broker listings, said closings jumped 9.9
percent and the median price decreased 0.5 percent to $843,375.  “The market is bipolar,” Sofia Song, vice president of
research for StreetEasy, said in a telephone interview. “You
have the luxury market driven by foreign demand, with foreigners
finding Manhattan to be a relative bargain. On the other hand,
you have entry-level demand with domestic buyers trying to take
advantage of the record-low  interest rates .”  Sales of studio and one-bedroom apartments rose 9 percent
from a year earlier to 1,203, according to an analysis by
Gregory Heym, chief economist for Brown Harris Stevens. Heym
said last year’s transactions at this level were depressed by
the expiration of a federal tax credit of as much as $8,000 for
first-time buyers that required contracts be signed by April 30.  Jonathan Krangel, 25, had been on the fence about buying
before closing on his first apartment at the end of August, with
his father co-signing on the deal. The East Village one-bedroom,
one-and-a-half-bathroom condo that he bought for $859,000 was a
“tremendous value” that he couldn’t pass up, he said.  New York Story  “I’m a firm believer in the New York story,” Krangel
said. “People still go out of their way to move to New York to
try to make a life for themselves. You wouldn’t say the same
thing about the Las Vegases or southern Floridas of the world.”  Manhattan properties stayed on the market an average of 119
days, down from 125 a year earlier, according to  Miller Samuel 
and Prudential.  Sales of luxury units, defined as the top 10 percent of all
deals by price, increased 17 percent from a year earlier to 311,
the companies said. The median price for a luxury apartment fell
5 percent to $4.17 million.  On the Upper East Side, the median price of co-op resales
dropped 2 percent from a year earlier to $885,000, according to
Corcoran. Median condo prices in the neighborhood fell 3 percent
to $1.1 million. On the Upper West Side, the median price of
previously owned co-ops slid 9 percent to $759,000, and condo
prices fell 4 percent to 1.06 million. For downtown Manhattan,
south of 34th Street, median prices for co-ops rose 11 percent
to $720,000, while condo prices fell 3 percent to $1.38 million.  “It’s unusual when you have high demand and low inventory
that prices remain flat and not rise,” Corcoran Chief Executive
Officer Pamela Liebman said in a phone interview. “The
macroeconomics of the city, state, country and the world will
likely prevent that from happening. People are not willing to
overpay.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
