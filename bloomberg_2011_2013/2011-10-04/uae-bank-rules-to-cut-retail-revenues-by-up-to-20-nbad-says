United Arab Emirates banks’ revenue
from their retail business are likely to decline as much as 20
percent as a result of central bank rules that took effect in
May, a  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC (NBAD)  official said.  “The impact will be significant. Definitely double-digit.
I’d say 15 percent to 20 percent on the entire revenue pool of
banks in this market, Suvo Sarkar, general manager for  consumer
banking  at NBAD, told a MEED conference ion Dubai today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
