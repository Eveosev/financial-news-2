South Korea ’s won sank to the lowest
level since July 2010 as concern  Europe  will fail to contain the
region’s debt crisis prompted investors to seek refuge in the
dollar. Bonds gained after inflation slowed more than forecast.  Greece passed austerity measures yesterday that will cut
its 2012  budget deficit  to 6.8 percent of gross domestic product,
short of the 6.5 percent goal previously agreed to secure
financial aid from the European Union,  International Monetary
Fund  and  European Central Bank . Euro-region finance chiefs will
meet on Oct. 13 to decide whether the push is enough to win
bailout funds needed to avoid default. The dollar strengthened
against 14 of 16 major currencies today.  The won fell 1.3 percent from its Sept. 30 close to
1,194.20 per dollar in  Seoul , following a 9.5 percent slide last
month that was the biggest since February 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Local financial markets were closed
yesterday for a holiday. The currency touched a 14-month low of
1,208.25 today, before paring its loss on suspected intervention
and demand from exporters, said Lee Jung Ha, a currency trader
with  Korea Development Bank .  “Demand for dollars was strong, after Korean markets were
closed for a holiday yesterday, on concern that Greece may
default on its debt,” he said in Seoul. “There is speculation
that the government intervened in the morning after the won
weakened below 1,200. The currency trimmed losses in the
afternoon as exporters sold dollars to convert income.”  Outflows, Inflation  The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  dropped 3.6 percent as overseas investors
sold more of the nation’s stocks than they bought following net
sales of $1.3 billion in September.  The government’s benchmark three-year bonds gained for a
second day. The yield on the 3.5 percent debt due June 2014 fell
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.48 percent,
Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. Benchmark ten-year bond yields
dropped 14 basis points to 3.8 percent.  South Korea’s consumer prices rose 4.3 percent in September
from a year earlier, down from a 5.3 percent gain in August that
was the biggest in three years, government data showed today.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 4.5
percent increase. Exports climbed 19.6 percent in September, the
slowest growth in three months, according to an Oct. 1 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
