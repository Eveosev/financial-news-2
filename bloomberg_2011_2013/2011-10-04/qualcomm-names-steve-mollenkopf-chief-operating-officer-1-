Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) , the biggest maker of
mobile-phone chips, promoted Steve Mollenkopf to president and
chief operating officer.  Mollenkopf will continue in his role as president for CDMA
wireless technologies and also oversee Qualcomm’s divisions,
business operations, market expansion and development areas, the
company said in a statement today. Steve Altman will become vice
chairman and continue his role on the executive committee.  Qualcomm’s radio chips are the most widely used in the
mobile phone industry. It also owns some of the technology used
in advanced, third-generation wireless services, helping it
collect higher licensing revenue as more consumers move to
handsets that connect to the Internet.  “Their leadership has been instrumental in Qualcomm’s
success and I look forward to working with them in their
expanded roles,” said  Paul Jacobs , chief executive officer of
Qualcomm, in the statement.  San Diego , California-based Qualcomm also named Derek Aberle executive vice president and group president, reporting
to Mollenkopf. Altman and Mollenkopf will continue to report to
Jacobs.  Altman joined Qualcomm 22 years ago and has been president
for six years. Mollenkopf began his career in 1994 at Qualcomm
as an engineer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
