OAO Novolipetsk Steel billionaire
 Vladimir Lisin ,  Russia ’s richest man, said none of the country’s
biggest stocks are good investments at the moment because of
uncertainty in global markets.  “I don’t think there’s a blue chip” worth the risk at the
moment, Lisin told reporters in Moscow today.  The current global economic slump will be “softer” than
the one that started in 2008, said Lisin, whose fortune Forbes
magazine estimates at $24 billion.  Capital flight is increasing and raising funds is becoming
a bigger challenge for companies, Lisin said.  Novolipetsk, or NLMK, fell 6.7 percent to 61.40 rubles at
1:46 p.m. in Moscow, the second-biggest loser in the Micex Index
of 30 stocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
