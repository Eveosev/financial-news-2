Egypt  is negotiating with  Israel  and
Jordan to increase prices of its gas sales in line with global
prices,  Al Ahram newspaper  reported, citing Egyptian Oil
Minister Abdalla Ghorab.  The North African country will in the next few days have a
final draft of the export contracts, Ghorab said. Gas shipments
to Israel have been suspended since a blast hit the pipeline
carrying the fuel, Ghorab added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
