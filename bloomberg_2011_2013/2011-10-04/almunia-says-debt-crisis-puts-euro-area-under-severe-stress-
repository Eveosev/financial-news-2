The debt crisis has put the euro area
under “severe stress,”  Joaquin Almunia , the European Union’s
antitrust commissioner,  said  today.  Almunia repeated that further bank restructuring measures
may be needed for banks in the EU.  “We cannot exclude that this number could grow in the near
future,” he said in prepared remarks for an event in Brussels
today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
