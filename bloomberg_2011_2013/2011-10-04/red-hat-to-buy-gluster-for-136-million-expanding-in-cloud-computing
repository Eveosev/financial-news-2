Red Hat Inc. (RHT) , a provider of open
source software and services, agreed to acquire closely held
Gluster Inc. for about $136 million in cash to expand in
Internet-based computing.  Red Hat’s third-quarter and full-year fiscal 2012 earnings
forecast aren’t changed by the deal, the Raleigh, North
Carolina-based company said in a statement today. Integrating
Gluster may make Red Hat’s fiscal 2013 operating margin
excluding some items 150 basis points lower than fiscal 2012.  Gluster gives Red Hat an opportunity to expand a $4 billion
market for storage of so-called unstructured data such as e-
mails and social media postings. The deal also helps Red Hat,
the largest seller of Linux software, offer more solutions to
customers who want to access data over the Internet using cloud
computing.  “This is an exciting new area of potential growth for Red
Hat and one in which we intend to invest aggressively,” said
Charlie Peters, Red Hat’s chief financial officer, in the
statement.  Red Hat fell $1.87, or 4.6 percent, to $38.59 at 9:40 a.m.
on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock had dropped 11 percent
this year before today.  The acquisition is expected to close this month, the
companies said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
