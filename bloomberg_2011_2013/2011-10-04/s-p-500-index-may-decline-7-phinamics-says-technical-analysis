The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
slump a further 7 percent after falling below a key technical
support level, according to an analyst who predicted the equity
gauge’s slump in May and yesterday’s selloff.  The 1,101 line represented the 61.8 percent retracement
level from the March 2009 to May 2011 rally, according to the
Fibonacci scale, and was also this year’s low, said Sylvain Asimus, founder of  Phinamics . He advised investors on May 5 to
sell shares, three days after the gauge had peaked at this
year’s intraday high of 1,370.58. He said before the start of
trading yesterday that a lower level was “imminent,”
anticipating the  S&P 500 ’s 2.9 percent slide to 1,099.23.  “The odd bounce notwithstanding, the market is heading
lower,” Asimus said in a phone interview from London today.
“Just as much as there was a double significance in the 1,101
level, the next support area at 1,018 also has a double
significance of being the 50 percent retracement and the 2010
low.”  Analysts who track charts to predict securities’ movements
look for support levels that may stop prices from falling and
resistances that act as ceilings limiting gains.  U.S. stocks tumbled yesterday as concern over  Greece ’s
debt crisis and Bank of America Corp.’s slump outweighed a
rebound in manufacturing and construction spending. Futures on
the S&P 500 slid 1.2 percent to 1,073.8 as of 8:11 a.m. in  New
York  today.  ‘Next Support Level’  “We could see the move to the next support level in one
day,” the analyst, who was previously head of equity and fixed-
income strategy at  France ’s Natixis bank, said in an interview
yesterday before the start of U.S. trading. “It’s a really
important barrier and nothing says we will not see
capitulation.”  Fibonacci analysis assumes markets retrace earlier patterns
in specific stages. A Fibonacci retracement level is created by
taking two extreme points on a security’s chart and dividing the
vertical distance by the key ratios of 23.6 percent, 38.2
percent, 50 percent, 61.8 percent and 100 percent. If a price
breaks through one of them, analysts say it may signal a move
toward the next point.  The second Fibonacci support level for the equities gauge
index lies at 935, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
