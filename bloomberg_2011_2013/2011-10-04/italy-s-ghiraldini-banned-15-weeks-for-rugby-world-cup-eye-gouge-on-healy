Italy hooker Leonardo Ghiraldini has
been suspended 15 weeks for an eye-gouging incident in a game
against Ireland at the  Rugby World Cup .  Ghiraldini admitted at a hearing today in Auckland to
making contact with the eye area of Ireland prop Cian Healy
during Italy’s 36-6 loss two days ago, but denied his action was
deliberate, tournament organizers said in a  statement .  After conducting a detailed review of all evidence
available, including television broadcasts and additional
evidence from Ghiraldini, tournament officials found the act to
be deliberate. The offense was categorized as top end and
carried a minimum 24-week suspension, but that was reduced
because of to 15 weeks because of Ghiraldini’s strong discipline
record. He has 48 hours to appeal the ban, officials said.  Ghiraldini can resume playing Jan. 18, 2012, making him
eligible for the start of the Six Nations tournament. Italy
finished third in Pool C and was eliminated from the  World Cup 
with the loss to Ireland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
