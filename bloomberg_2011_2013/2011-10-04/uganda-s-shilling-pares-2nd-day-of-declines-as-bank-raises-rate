Uganda ’s shilling pared a second day
of declines against the dollar as the central bank raised its
key  interest rate  by four percentage points to curb inflation,
which is at a more than 18-year high.  The currency of  East Africa ’s third-biggest economy lost as
much as 0.9 percent to 2,885.50 per dollar and traded less than
0.1 percent down at 2,865 by 2:42 p.m. in Kampala, the capital,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank raised the rate to 20 percent from 16
percent at its August meeting after the inflation rate surged to
28.3 percent in September. The interest rate was introduced in
July at 13 percent.  “The announcement by the central  bank rate  partially
helped the shilling gain,” Daniel Sage, a currency trader at
Centenary Bank Ltd., said by phone from Kampala. “Tomorrow’s
auction of Treasury bills has also helped attract offshore
investors because the yields are attractive.”  Uganda’s central bank is offering 95 billion shillings ($33
million) of three-, six- and 12-month bills tomorrow. The yield
on 91-day bills climbed to 17.412 percent at Sept. 21’s sale,
the highest since at least March 2005.  Uganda’s shilling reached 2,897.50 against the dollar on
Sept. 23, the weakest since June 1993, as inflation increased
and on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will weaken riskier assets
further. The currency slipped 19 percent this year to the
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
