The euro touched the lowest level in
more than a decade against the yen amid fading optimism that
European policy makers will resolve the region’s debt crisis.  The 17-nation currency reached an eight-month low versus
the dollar after European governments signaled bondholders may
have to take bigger losses on Greek sovereign debt. The euro
pared declines as its 14-day relative strength index versus the
dollar and the yen were both below the 30-level that some
traders see as signaling an asset’s price has fallen too rapidly
and may be poised for a rebound.  “There isn’t much progress in containing the sovereign
problem,” said Kengo Suzuki, manager of the foreign-bond
department in  Tokyo  at Mizuho Securities Co., a unit of  Japan ’s
third-largest listed bank. “That’s negative for the euro.”  The euro was little changed at 100.98 yen at 8:42 a.m. in
London from 100.97 yen in  New York  yesterday after dropping to
as low as 100.76, the least since June 2001. The common European
currency traded at $1.3181 from $1.3176 after touching $1.3164,
the weakest since Jan. 13.  European finance ministers meeting in Luxembourg considered
“technical revisions” to a July deal for Greece that foresaw
investors contributing 50 billion euros ($66 billion) to a 159
billion-euro rescue. That “private sector involvement”
includes debt swaps and rollovers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
