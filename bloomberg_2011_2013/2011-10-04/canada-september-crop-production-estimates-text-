Following is the text
of the field crop production estimate report
according to  Statistics Canada :  With harvest underway, the good mid-summer
weather conditions have Western farmers
anticipating increased production of canola, as
well as higher volumes of barley and wheat
compared with 2010. Farmers in Ontario and Quebec
expect lower yields and a smaller crop of corn for
grain in 2011, while Quebec farmers anticipate a
record soybean production.  Total wheat production up  Total wheat production in the West is expected
to reach 21.7 million metric tonnes in 2011, up
3.0% from 2010. Yield has been flat for the past
four years and 2011 sees this trend continue with
an anticipated yield of 40.1 bushels per acre.  The rise in production was mainly attributable
to an increase in durum wheat. Durum wheat
production is expected to increase 30.2% from 2010
to 3.9 million tonnes, on the strength of higher
anticipated harvested area, up 27.5%, and in
expected yield, from 36.1 to 36.9 bushels per acre
in 2011.  Canola production expected to increase  Western farmers reported that canola production
could reach 12.8 million tonnes, up 1.1% from 2010
production. The advance is the result of a record
harvested area of 17.9 million acres, up 6.3% over
2010.  However, the expected yield of 31.6 bushels per
acre represents a decline of 4.8% from 2010. Of
the four western provinces, only Manitoba expects
its canola production to decline from 2010 levels.  Barley production rises  Despite a lower harvested area compared with
2010, Canadian farmers anticipate that increased
yields of barley will lead to a production of 7.9
million tonnes, up 3.8% or 292 600 tonnes from
2010.  Barley yields are expected to reach 62.5
bushels per acre in 2011, up 5.6% from 2010. The
increase is concentrated in Saskatchewan, where
production is expected to reach 2.5 million tonnes
in 2011, up from 1.9 million tonnes in 2010.  Smaller corn for grain harvest for Ontario and
 Quebec  farmers  In Ontario, production estimates for corn for
grain were down 13.8% from 2010 to 6.7 million
tonnes, the result of a 23.4 bushel per acre drop
in yield to 140.6 bushels per acre. Harvested area
should remain almost unchanged from 2010 at 1.9
million acres.  Similarly, Quebec farmers expect corn for grain
production to fall 12.9% to 3.0 million tonnes in
2011, an anticipated decrease of 440 000 tonnes
from the 3.4 million tonnes in 2010. The expected
drop would primarily be the result of a 12.2%
decline in yield to 130.0 bushels per acre, from
148.0 bushels per acre in 2010. The decline of
0.8% in seeded area for corn for grain represents
the fourth consecutive year that Quebec farmers
have seeded fewer acres to this crop.  Soybean national production expected to fall from
record levels in 2010  At the national level, soybean production is
expected to decrease from 4.3 million tonnes in
2010 to 3.9 million tonnes. Most of this decline
comes from Ontario where, despite an amount of
harvested acres virtually unchanged from 2010,
yield is expected to drop by 5.5 bushels per acre
to 40.5 bushels per acre. Manitoba farmers also
expect a lower average yield, from 31.4 bushels
per acre in 2010 to 25.7 bushels per acre in 2011.  Quebec farmers, however, are expecting a second
consecutive record soybean harvest in 2011 at 820
000 tonnes, up 13 000 tonnes from 2010. The 14.6%
increase in harvested area is expected to make up
for the 11.3% decline in average yield.  Note to readers  The September Farm Survey of 14,100 Canadian
farmers is a preliminary survey of field crop
production in  Canada . The survey was conducted
from September 1 to September 9, 2011. Farmers
were asked to report their estimated area, yield
and production of grains, oilseeds and special
crops.  Final production estimates for 2011 will be
released on December 6, 2011, and will be subject
to revision for two years.  Auxiliary data source: As an additional tool to
assess the growing conditions of Canadian field
crops during the crop year, readers are invited to
visit the Crop Condition Assessment Program web
application, where a vegetation index of the crop
land can be monitored weekly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
