European Union finance ministers
reached an agreement on draft regulations aimed at increasing
transparency and reducing risk in the over-the-counter
 derivatives market .  “The draft regulation calls for reporting of all
derivative contracts to trade repositories (i.e. central data
centers) and the clearing of standardised OTC derivative
contracts through central counterparties in order to reduce
counterparty risk,” the ministers said today in a statement at
a meeting in Luxembourg. “This is aimed at preventing the
default of one market participant causing the collapse of other
market players, thereby putting the entire financial system at
risk.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
