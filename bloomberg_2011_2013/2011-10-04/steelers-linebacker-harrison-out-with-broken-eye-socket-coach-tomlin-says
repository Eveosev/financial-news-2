Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker  James
Harrison  has a broken bone in his eye socket and will miss an
as-yet undetermined amount of games, coach  Mike Tomlin  said on
the team’s website.  Harrison, who was the National Football League’s defensive
player of the year in 2008, will undergo surgery to repair his
right obital bone and will be out “a number of weeks,” Tomlin
told reporters.  Harrison was fined a total of $100,000 last season for
dangerous hits on other players.  The Steelers (2-2) host the Tennessee Titans (3-1) this
weekend.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
