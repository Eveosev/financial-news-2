South Korean stocks fell, with the
benchmark index sinking the most among Asian gauges, as shares
traded for the first time this week amid concern the nation’s
economic growth is slowing.  The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  lost 3.6 percent to 1,706.19 at the 3 p.m.
close in Seoul, its biggest retreat since Sept. 23. South Korean
markets were shut yesterday for a holiday when the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index slipped 3.2 percent. The country’s exchange
briefly halted program trading of shares today after futures
tumbled. Samsung Electronics Co. and  LG Chem Ltd. (051910)  led declines
among the nation’s biggest companies.  A gauge of Korean manufacturing contracted for a second
month in September while the nation’s exports expanded at the
slowest pace in three months.  South Korea  needs to bolster its
economy to cope with heightened global uncertainties, Finance
Minister Bahk Jae Wan said today.  “Investors are gripped with fears again given the
unpredictability of  Europe ’s debt troubles as well as growth
concerns,” said Han Sang Soo, a  fund manager  at Samsung Asset
Management Co. in Seoul, which oversees about $28 billion in
assets. “Volatility will be here as those issues won’t be
resolved in a day.”  European finance ministers meeting yesterday considered
“technical revisions” to a July deal for a second Greek
bailout, indicating that bondholders may have to take bigger
losses on the nation’s debt.  The Kospi 200 Volatility Index, which tracks the cost of
buying protection against losses in the equity gauge of South
Korea’s largest companies, rose 12 percent to 45.32, the biggest
increase since Sept. 23.  Bear Market  The Kospi sank 16 percent in the third quarter, the most
since the last three months of 2008. The gauge has lost 23
percent since reaching a record high on May 2. A drop of 20
percent or more signifies a  bear market  to some investors.
Stocks in the index trade at 8.8 times estimated profit, less
than the 9.1 multiple for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  Samsung Electronics  retreated 1.4 percent to 828,000 won.
Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., the world’s biggest shipbuilder,
sank 5 percent to 267,000 won. LG Chem, South Korea’s biggest
chemicals maker, plunged 8.4 percent to 294,000 won.  A South Korean purchasing managers’ index for September
fell to 47.5, according to HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics today. A figure below 50 indicates a contraction.  The nation’s exports rose 19.6 percent last month from a
year earlier, slowing from a revised 25.9 percent gain in
August, the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said on Oct. 1.  Hyundai Motor lost 2.8 percent to 205,000 won and affiliate
 Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  dropped 3.7 percent to 69,200 won  after U.S.
sales gains missed consensus analyst estimates. Combined sales
for the two automakers rose 14 percent last month, less than the
20 percent gain that was the average of three estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  Poongsan Corp., a copper-product maker, slid 10 percent to
23,000 won after copper in  London  plunged for a fifth Day. SK
Innovation Co., South Korea’s largest oil refiner that also
produces oil, sank 9.9 percent after crude and oil-product
prices dropped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
