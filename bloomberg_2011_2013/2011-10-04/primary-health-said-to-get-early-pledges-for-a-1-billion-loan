Primary Health Care Ltd. (PRY) , an
Australian provider of medical tests, has received early
commitments from two banks as it markets a A$1 billion ($952
million) loan, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The pledges from lenders have been received ahead of a
deadline for commitments of mid to late October, the person
said, asking not to be named as the details are private.
National Australia Bank Ltd. is arranging the loan, which will
be used to refinance existing debt, the person said.  Primary Health, based in Sydney, has A$1 billion of three-
year loans due in December 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Primary is currently considering the opportunity to
refinance well before maturity of debt in December 2012,” the
company said in its annual report filed with the stock exchange
on Sept. 19. “Primary has received strong interest from its
existing syndicate to support this opportunity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
