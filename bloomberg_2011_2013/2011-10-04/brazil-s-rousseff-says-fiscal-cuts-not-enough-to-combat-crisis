Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff 
said budget cuts are not enough to tackle the debt crisis.  “History shows us that we will only be able to exit the
crisis through stimulus to economic growth, coupled with
macroeconomic stability policies as well as social policies
aimed at creating jobs and income,” Rousseff told a press
conference today in Brussels following a meeting with European
Union officials. “Simply adopting” fiscal adjustments “is not
enough; more than that we must adopt macroeconomic policies
while seeking to firmly tackle unemployment,” she said.  “One must clearly understand that the absence of effective
regulation of the financial system lies at the root of this
entire process,” Rousseff said. “We’re now in stage two of the
crisis. The policy of bailing out financial institutions has led
to a high government indebtedness in the vast majority of
developed countries. We now face an increased sovereign risk,”
she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
