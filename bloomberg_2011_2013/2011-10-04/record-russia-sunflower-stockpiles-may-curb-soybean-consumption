Russian sunflowerseed stockpiles and
exports will reach a record this year on improved yields,
pressuring prices for cooking oils including those made from
soybeans and palm, Oil World said.  Production in  Russia  in the year through August 2012 will
gain 61 percent to 9.2 million metric tons while the amount
processed rises 44 percent to 7.8 million tons and exports reach
700,000 tons, up from 10,000 tons a year earlier, Oil World
said in a report today. Exports of sunoil will total 900,000
tons, up from 30,000 tons last year, the researcher said.  “Record supplies of sunflowerseed, oil and meal will soon
start to move onto the world market,” Oil World said. “With
harvesting expanding, sunflower yields have reportedly stayed
above expectations in the past few days, although they declined
somewhat from the exceptionally high levels obtained
initially.”  Increased production and exports from Russia will pressure
soybean oil prices on the Chicago Board of Trade that are
already down 15 percent this year and palm oil prices on the
Malaysian Derivatives Exchange that yesterday dropped to a one-
year low of 2,845 ringgit ($887) a metric ton.  Sunflower harvesting is behind in Russia as collection of
the oilseeds totaled 1.4 million hectares (3.5 million acres) on
Sept. 28 compared with 2.5 million hectares at the same time a
year earlier, Oil World said. Yields are averaging about 1.85
tons a hectare, up from 1.13 tons a year ago, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
