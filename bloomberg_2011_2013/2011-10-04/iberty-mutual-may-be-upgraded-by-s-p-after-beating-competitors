Liberty Mutual Holding Co. insurance
units may be upgraded by  Standard & Poor’s  for doing a better
job than the industry of limiting costs from natural disasters.  The outlook was raised to “positive” from “stable” as
“performance compares favorably to that of peers,” the ratings
firm said today in a statement on the Boston-based insurer.
“Liberty has strong catastrophe risk controls and we don’t
expect the company to be a negative outlier in terms of natural
catastrophe losses.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
