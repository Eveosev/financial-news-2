Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY)  plans to
continue “growing the company and delivering value to
shareholders,” Chief Executive Officer Lamberto Andreotti said
today.  He declined to comment on whether the drugmaker has
received takeover approaches.  “Our board of directors has a fiduciary duty of
considering proposals,” he said at a news conference in Paris.
“It’s up to them to decide what to do. We as managers are
focused on our jobs, which is growing the company and delivering
value to shareholders.”  Bristol-Myers will remain disciplined in making
acquisitions, Chief Financial Officer Charles Bancroft said.
Targets have to be strategic and make economic sense, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
