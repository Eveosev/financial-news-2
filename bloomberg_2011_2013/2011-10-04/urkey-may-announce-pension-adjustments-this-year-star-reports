Turkey â€™s government plans to announce
steps this year to eliminate what is says is injustice in
pension payments, Star newspaper reported, citing Labor Minister
Faruk Celik.  The changes will impact about 2.5 million people who
retired before 2000 and get lower pension payments even though
their contributions were the same as peers who retired after
that year, Celik said, according to the Istanbul-based
newspaper. Officials have studied the various methods used to
calculate final pensions and will announce a resolution this
year after discussions with the  Finance Ministry , Celik said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
