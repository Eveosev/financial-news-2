Poland ’s WIG20 Index slumped 56.72,
or 2.6 percent, to close at 2,089.84 at 5:30 p.m. in Warsaw, the
lowest close since August 2009.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  PZU SA (PZU PW), Poland’s biggest insurer, slumped 10.8
zloty, or 3.5 percent, to 294.2 zloty, the lowest level since
the stock started trading in May 2010. PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO
PW), the country’s biggest bank, fell 0.76 zloty, or 2.4
percent, to 31.19 zloty and  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  , a unit of
UniCredit SpA, lost 4 zloty, or 3 percent, to 131.1 zloty.  Financial shares slumped across Europe on deepening concern
policy makers won’t be able to resolve the region’s debt crisis.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s sole copper
producer, fell for a fifth day, sliding 6.5 zloty, or 5.2
percent, to 117.5 zloty. Copper fell on concern metals demand
may weaken as a worsening European sovereign-debt crisis saps
economies.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW), Poland’s biggest oil company, sank
1.02 zloty, or 2.9 percent, to 33.98 zloty.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , the second-largest refiner, tumbled 1.26 zloty, or 5.3
percent, to 22.7 zloty.  Orlen expects to book financial losses of “several hundred
million” zloty in the third quarter from revaluation of
foreign-currency debt due to the weaker zloty, Chief Financial
Officer Slawomir Jedrzejczyk said today. Separately, oil fell to
its lowest in more than a year in New York on signs of rising
production from Libya and concern about slowing economies in
 Europe  and the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
