New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie ,
who has been deliberating whether to run for president in 2012,
scheduled a 1 p.m. press conference at the state capitol in
Trenton.  Christie won’t run for president, ABC News reported, citing
a “source with direct knowledge of the governor’s thinking.”
 Kevin Roberts , a spokesman for Christie, declined to say the
purpose of the meeting with reporters, which will be held in the
governor’s Statehouse office.  The 49-year-old Republican has said repeatedly that he
would “have to commit suicide” to convince people he won’t
seek higher office. While on a national round of speeches and
fundraisers for state Republican parties last week, he came
under increasing pressure to change his mind. In recent days, he
has been considering entering the race, said a Republican donor
who asked not to be identified because he isn’t authorized to
speak publicly.  Republican party fundraisers across the country, including
Kenneth Langone, co-founder of  Home Depot Inc. (HD) , have urged
Christie to get into the presidential race.  Christie took office in January 2010 after defeating
incumbent Democrat  Jon Corzine  amid voter dissatisfaction over
the highest property taxes in the U.S. and a sluggish economy.
He cut $10 billion in projected spending on schools, pensions
and towns and required public workers to pay more for health
care, in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
