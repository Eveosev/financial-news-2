Food-safety programs may be less
vulnerable to cuts than other areas of U.S. Department of
Agriculture spending because of the importance placed on the
nutrition supply, Secretary Tom Vilsack said.  “I’m least concerned about the food-safety part than any
other part,” Vilsack said today at a food-policy conference in
 Washington . Nutrition assistance for poor families may be more
vulnerable, even as it helps lower poverty, Vilsack said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
