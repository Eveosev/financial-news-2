U.S. stocks rallied, driving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index up 4.1 percent in the final 50
minutes of trading, amid speculation European Union officials
are examining how to recapitalize the region’s banks.  Financial stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index jumped
4.1 percent as a group, reversing a 2.9 percent drop.  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  added at least 4.1
percent. DuPont Co. and  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  rallied more than
3.6 percent, pacing in companies most-tied to economic growth.
 AMR Corp. (AMR)  surged 21 percent as analysts said the parent of
 American Airlines  is unlikely to file for bankruptcy.  The S&P 500 rose 2.3 percent to 1,123.95 at 4 p.m. New York
time. The index plunged 2.2 percent earlier, to a level that
would mark more than a 20 percent drop from an April peak, the
threshold of a bear market. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
lost 153.41 points, or 1.4 percent, to 10,808.71 today.  “The European crisis has been the market driver,”  Richard Sichel , who oversees $1.6 billion as chief investment officer at
Philadelphia Trust Co., said in a phone interview. “If  Europe 
comes out with something to kick the can down the road, it buys
them more time. We learned in 2008 how important the financial
system is and how a ripple effect can occur.”  Stocks reversed losses in the final hour of trading after a
report in the Financial Times quoted  Olli Rehn , European
commissioner for economic affairs, as saying there is an
“increasingly shared view” that the region needs a coordinated
approach to halt the sovereign debt crisis. Belgian Prime
Minister  Yves Leterme  said a “bad bank” for troubled assets
will be set up for Dexia SA and will have government guarantees.  Due for Rally  Stocks were due for a rally after falling more than 5
percent in the previous two sessions, Paul Zemsky, the New York-
based head of asset allocation for ING Investment Management,
said. His firm oversees $550 billion. The  S&P 500  is trading for
12.2 times earnings in the last 12 months, close to the lowest
since March 2009.  “The market doesn’t go on a straight line either up or
down,” Zemsky said in a telephone interview. “There’s no sign
of recession in the U.S. and yet the market is pricing for one.
So you’re going to have days when things pop up and you’re going
to have bear market rallies.”  About 7 percent of S&P 500 stocks began the day trading
above their average price in the last 200 days, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That matched the proportion
following the Aug. 8 rout for the lowest level in 30 months. The
full index began today 14.1 percent below its 200-day moving
average, the biggest gap since April 30, 2009.  Bear Markets  Concern governments may be running out of tools to keep the
global economic slowdown from worsening has left equities from
 Brazil  to  Hong Kong  and Frankfurt in bear markets. The declines
have confounded bullish investors who speculated the recovery
that began in March 2009 would boost stocks for a third year.  Global stocks fell earlier after some officials hinted that
bondholders may have to take bigger losses on Greek debt than
previously negotiated. Deutsche Bank AG scrapped its profit
forecast and announced 500 job cuts and further writedowns of
Greek bond holdings amid a “significant and unabated slowdown
in client activity” in the wake of Europe’s debt crisis.  Equities briefly rose after Fed Chairman Bernanke said the
central bank “will continue to closely monitor economic
developments and is prepared to take further action as
appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context
of price stability. Bernanke made his remarks today in testimony
to Congress’s Joint Economic Committee in  Washington .  Banks Surge  Banks, brokerages and insurers led the rally as the  S&P
500 Financials Index (S5FINL)  jumped 6.5 percent between 3:18 p.m. and 4
p.m. New York time. The KBW Bank Index jumped 4.5 percent, after
slumping 3.2 percent earlier. Bank of America added 4.2 percent
to $5.76. JPMorgan rose 6.6 percent, the most in the Dow, to
$30.26.  Morgan Stanley (MS) , owner of the biggest retail brokerage,
rose 12 percent, the largest gain in the S&P 500.  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to
the economy rallied 4.3 percent. The Dow Jones Transportation
Average, a proxy for the economy, added 4.4 percent. DuPont
increased 4.5 percent to $40.23. Hewlett-Packard advanced 3.7
percent to $23.02.  The Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index of 10 companies added 6.3
percent. AMR gained 21 percent to $2.39, after falling 33
percent yesterday on concern the company may file for
bankruptcy. Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR reiterated yesterday
that Chapter 11 protection ‘‘is certainly not our goal or our
preference’’ as the third-largest U.S. airline seeks more
productivity in union agreements.  Apple Slumps  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  dropped 3.6 percent to $361.23. The company, in
its first product unveiling since  Steve Jobs  resigned as chief
executive officer, introduced an iPhone with a stronger
processor to help it vie with Google Inc.’s Android. The update
of Apple’s best-selling product marks an early test for Tim
Cook, CEO since Aug. 24, who hasn’t yet shown he can match his
predecessor’s skills at product design and marketing.  ‘‘There is some disappointment that only one new iPhone has
been announced,” said Shaw Wu, an analyst at Birmingham,
Alabama-based Sterne Agee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
