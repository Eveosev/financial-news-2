Greenhill & Co., the advisory firm
that has slid 64 percent in New York trading this year, may sell
its entire $62.5 million stake in  Iridium Communications Inc. (IRDM) 
over two years to fund repurchases of its own stock.  Greenhill, based in New York, filed a so-called 10b5-1 plan
to sell as much as 9.8 million shares, according to a statement
by satellite operator Iridium, whose shares closed at $6.38
today.  Sales will be made in “small daily increments,” Greenhill
Chief Executive Officer Scott Bok wrote in a letter today to
McLean, Virginia-based Iridium filed with regulators.  The disposal “beginning now is primarily to fund the
repurchase of our own Greenhill common stock, which we believe
is an attractive opportunity at this time,” Bok wrote. Sales
will be paced over years in the hope that “the full value of
Iridium will be reflected in its share price over time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
