U.S. stocks will rally as European
policy makers act to prevent the Greek debt crisis, calming
investors who have pushed American equities to the brink of a
 bear market , UBS AG said.  “Worst-case outcomes in Europe will not come to pass,”
 Jonathan Golub , UBS’s New York-based chief market strategist,
wrote in a report today. Euro-zone governments will provide
solutions to the region’s fiscal problems and “we believe that
stocks are likely to rebound hard when that moment arises,
making a tactical shift quite difficult,” he wrote.  Concern policy makers may be running out of tools to keep
the global slowdown from worsening wiped out about $10 trillion
from global equity markets in the third quarter. Benchmark
measures for 37 out of 45 nations in the MSCI All-Country World
Index had posted bear-market declines of 20 percent or more as
of Oct. 3, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Stocks may rise as market volatility falls and investors
gain clarity on  Europe ’s ability to solve its crisis, Golub
said. A drop in the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index from 43 to 20 would correspond to a 10 percent gain in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, he wrote. When the VIX, derived
from prices paid for options to protect equities from losses,
has moved 5.5 percent, stocks have changed 1 percent in the
opposite direction over the past three years, Golub said.  Unprecedented Swings  Golub said in December 2010 the S&P 500 would end this year
at 1,325. He raised that estimate to 1,425 in February before
cutting it to 1,350 last month, a 23 percent advance from
yesterday’s closing level. The average estimate of 13
strategists calls for the benchmark measure to end 2011 at 1,305
as of Sept. 26. Golub said in 2010 the  S&P 500  would finish the
year at 1,350 before reducing that estimate to 1,150 in July
2010. The equity gauge rallied 13 percent to 1,257.64 last year.  U.S. stocks posted unprecedented swings in the last three
months on concern Europe’s debt crisis will spur the second
global recession in three years. The VIX averaged 30.6 during
the third quarter, the highest since 2009, Bloomberg data show.  Europe has been struggling to contain a crisis that pushed
yields on Greek, Italian and Spanish bonds to records in the
third quarter amid concern  Greece  may default on its debt.
Europe’s financial leaders are trying to repair Greece’s economy
while insulating Italy and  Spain  and shoring up banks that the
 International Monetary Fund  says face as much as 300 billion
euros ($400 billion) in credit risks.  The VIX slipped 1.4 percent to 44.83 at 11:46 a.m. New York
time as the S&P 500 lost 0.8 percent to 1,090.99.  To contact the reporter on this story:
