Emaar  Middle East , a unit of  Emaar
Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , will hand over villas in Al Nada Village by
year end after missing its second-quarter 2010 completion
target, said General Manager Ahmad al-Kulli.  “The final touches to the homes and landscape are
currently being undertaken,” he said in a statement today. The
villas are part of the $1.3 billion Al Khobar Lakes development.  The project in the kingdom’s eastern province was started
in May 2008. Al-Kulli in June blamed delays of the Al Khobar
Lakes and other Emaar Middle East projects such as Jeddah Gate
and the King Abdullah Economic City on bureaucracy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
