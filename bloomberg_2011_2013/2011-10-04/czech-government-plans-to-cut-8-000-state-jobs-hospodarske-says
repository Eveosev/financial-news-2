The Czech government is proposing to
cut 7,941 jobs, or 1.8 percent of state employees, while raising
salaries for other workers it will retain next year, the 2012
budget draft shows.  The number of people working in public administration would
decline to 425,090, according to the budget draft posted on the
Finance Ministry  website .  The plan “in general can be understood as a measure aimed
at making state administration more efficient,” the budget
draft said.  The government of Prime Minister Petr Necas has passed
legislation overhauling health care and pensions and has sought
to streamline budget-making processes to narrow the  budget
deficit . The three-party Cabinet’s plan has helped attract
investor interest, with the country’s five-year bond
outperforming similar German debt in the past year.  The allocation for total state salaries in 2012 will rise
845 million koruna ($45 million) to 128.5 billion koruna, the
draft shows.  The average public wage will rise 2.6 percent to 23,833
koruna next year, the ministry said in the draft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
