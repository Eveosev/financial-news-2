European governments don’t have an
estimate of the size of possible additional losses for
bondholders in a revamped Greek bailout, Austrian Finance
Minister Maria Fekter said.  “We have to recalculate what that will actually cost and
how to deal with it but that is not being discussed now because
we haven’t had the report from  Greece  yet,” Fekter told
reporters after a meeting of European finance ministers in
 Luxembourg  today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
