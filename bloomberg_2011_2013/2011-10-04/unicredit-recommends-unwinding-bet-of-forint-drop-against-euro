Investors should unwind bets on a
forint drop against the euro,  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  said in an e-mail
today.  UniCredit remains underweight on all Hungarian assets,
Vienna-based strategist  Gyula Toth  said. The bank is keeping its
recommendation of betting on a strengthening Polish zloty
against the forint, he said.  “We believe the most important game changer for Hungary
would be a potential renewed cooperation with the IMF,” Toth
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
