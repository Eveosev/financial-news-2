South Korea ’s foreign-exchange
reserves dropped the most in almost three years in September due
to declines in the value of the euro and pound against the
dollar, according to the central bank.  Reserves shrank to $303.4 billion from $312.2 billion in
August, the  Bank of Korea  said in a statement in  Seoul  today.
That’s the biggest drop since November 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
