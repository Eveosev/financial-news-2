Uganda ’s  National Social Security
Fund  cut  interest rates  on members’ contributions to 6 percent
this year from 7 percent in 2010 because of a slowdown in the
economy and costs incurred in a law suit, Daily Monitor
reported, citing Richard Byarugaba, the managing director.  The fund is required to deposit 13 billion shillings ($5
million) with the  Supreme Court  over a law suit by a Kenyan
company contesting the NSSF’s cancellation of a building
contract, the Kampala-based newspaper reported. Uganda’s
inflation rate in September accelerated to 28.3 percent, the
highest in 18 years, from 21.4 percent in August, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
