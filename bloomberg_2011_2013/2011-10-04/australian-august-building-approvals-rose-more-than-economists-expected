Australian home-building approvals
jumped in August, the second straight advance, as a nine-month
pause on  interest rates  led to stronger demand for apartments
and home renovations.  The number of permits granted to build or renovate houses
and apartments rose 11.4 percent from July, when they gained a
revised 1.8 percent, the Bureau of Statistics said in Sydney
today. That compares with the median forecast for a 1 percent
increase in a Bloomberg News survey of 21 economists.  Australia ’s borrowing costs are the highest in the
developed world as the  Reserve Bank  seeks to contain inflation
during the nation’s biggest mining expansion in more than a
century. Governor  Glenn Stevens  will keep interest rates
unchanged at 4.75 percent for an 11th month today, a Bloomberg
News survey of economists showed, to gauge the fallout from
 Europe ’s  sovereign-debt crisis and the U.S. fiscal problems.  “The volume of anecdotes of rising housing activity in
both the home building and auction markets have markedly
increased in the past month,” Roland Randall, an economist at
TD Securities Inc. in  Singapore , wrote before the report.  Building approvals in August dropped 5.5 percent from a
year earlier, the report showed. That compares with economists’
forecast for a 15.1 percent drop year-over-year.  Approvals to build private houses fell 1 percent to 7,547
in August from the previous month, the report showed. Approvals
for apartments and renovations advanced 35.1 percent to 5,829.
 Australia’s higher borrowing costs relative to other developed-
world economies and a mining-investment boom helped drive the
Australian dollar to $1.1081 on July 27, the highest since
exchange controls were scrapped in 1983. The currency is down
about 14 percent since then, buying 95.16 cents just before
today’s data were released.  The nation’s labor market has weakened this year, with
monthly employment growth averaging 2,800 from January through
August, less than a 10th of the average of 30,500 in the first
eight months of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
