Chile , the world’s biggest copper-
producing nation, expects mining companies to maintain their
investment plans even after prices slumped by the most in three
years and is seeing few signs of weaker Chinese demand.  Spending on new or existing mines will reach $67 billion
over the next eight years, Mining Minister Hernan de Solminihac
said in an interview in London yesterday. Codelco, the state-
owned copper company, will account for $20 billion of the total.
While there has been “some adjustment” in  China ’s imports, the
change hasn’t been “significant,” the minister said.  Copper slumped 33 percent since reaching a record $10,190 a
metric ton in February as mounting concern about growth eroded
expectations for supply shortages. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
 Barclays Capital  and Standard Bank Plc cut their forecasts in
the past week. Speculators in U.S. futures held their biggest
bet on falling prices since July 2009 as of Sept. 20, Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data show.  “The fundamentals don’t explain the decrease in the
price,” said the 53-year-old minister. “Most of the price is
because the people are looking at what is going on in the
market, the international turbulence that we have, so they are
kind of worried about the situation in  Europe  and the U.S., so
they’re trying to be more careful. As soon as the economy
stabilizes, there should be a rebound.”  Copper fell 29 percent to $6,789 this year on the  London 
Metal Exchange, heading for its second-worst year in almost a
quarter century. Prices dropped 54 percent in 2008. Futures
traded on the Comex exchange in New York slumped 31 percent to
$3.063 a pound, the worst performer in the Standard & Poor’s
GSCI gauge of 24 commodities.  European Federation  That compares with a 17 percent decline in the MSCI All-
Country World Index of equities and a 29 percent return for
Treasuries maturing in 10 years or more, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies.  Consumers in China, the world’s biggest users, should take
advantage of the slump in prices to restock, Codelco Chief
Executive Officer  Diego Hernandez  said in an interview in London
yesterday. Orders from Asia look “quite strong” for next year
and clients in Europe are “cautious,” he said.  China imported 235,509 tons of copper in August, 21 percent
more than in July and the most since January, customs data show.
Stockpiles in warehouses monitored by the  Shanghai  Futures
Exchange fell 45 percent since March.  Hernandez and the minister, who was appointed to the post
in July, are in London for LME week. The annual event is
attracting as many as 5,000 merchants to the British capital
this year for talks on metals markets and supply contracts.  BHP Billiton   BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , based in  Melbourne ,  Anglo American Plc (AAL) ,
Rio Tinto Group and  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  are among the biggest foreign
mining companies investing in Chile. BHP owns Escondida, the
world’s biggest copper mine, while London-based Anglo and Zug,
Switzerland-based Xstrata own Collahuasi, the third-largest.  Mining companies are basing their investment decisions on
the assumption that copper will average $2.50 a pound or more in
the long term, De Solminihac said. Chile has 8,000 mines,
dominated by the copper industry.  Chile’s government is budgeting for an average copper price
of $2.80 a pound this year and $3.02 in 2012, the minister said.
The metal averaged $4.19 so far this year on Comex and no
futures contract going out to 2015 is trading below the
government’s 2012 target. Mining employs 200,000 people in
Chile, accounts for 20 percent of the economy and 50 percent of
exports, said De Solminihac, who has a doctorate in engineering.  Commodity Analysts  While Barclays cut its forecast for the shortfall in supply
five times since April, the bank still anticipates a shortage of
468,000 tons this year and 153,000 tons in 2012, according to a
Sept. 30 report. Copper will average a record $10,075 next year,
the bank’s team of commodity analysts estimates.  Supply and demand may be in balance in about four years,
potentially moving to a surplus by 2018, De Solminihac said.  Mining companies have struggled to keep pace with demand
because of declining ore grades and rising costs. Ore grades
averaged 0.76 percent copper content in 2009, compared with 0.9
percent in 2002, according to CRU, a London-based research
company. That means one ton of rock contains 7.6 kilograms (16.8
pounds) of metal. Copper-mining costs rose 20 percent in Chile
last year, UBS AG estimated in a report in May.  Goldman expects copper to reach $9,500 in 12 months, down
from an earlier estimate of $11,000, according to a report
yesterday. The bank cut its estimate for 2012 world growth to
3.5 percent from about 4 percent. That compares with the 5.2
percent contraction the  World Bank  estimates took place in 2009.
Emerging markets can be “relatively resilient” to slowing
developed economies, Goldman’s analysts wrote in the report.  New York   Copper demand shrank 0.9 percent in 2008, amid the worst
global recession since World War II, Morgan Stanley estimates.
Global stockpiles in warehouses monitored by exchanges in
London, New York and Shanghai expanded 15 percent to 652,385
tons this year, about 50 percent more than the average over the
past five years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Most of those gains were registered by the London Metal
Exchange and Comex. China, which accounts for about 37 percent
of global copper demand, will expand 9.3 percent this year,
compared with 10.4 percent in 2010, according to the median of
10 economists’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. U.S. growth will
slow to 1.6 percent this year, from 3 percent in 2010, the
estimates show.  China looks “quite confident to continue with current
demand,” Codelco’s Hernandez said. “We don’t see them slowing
down but of course it’s early days on this sales campaign.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
