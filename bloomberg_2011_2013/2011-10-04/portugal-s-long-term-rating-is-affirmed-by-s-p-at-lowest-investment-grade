Portugal had its  credit rating 
affirmed at the investment-grade level BBB- by  Standard &
Poor’s , which cited the nation’s commitment to a financial aid
program.  The outlook remains negative due to the “implementation
risks” of the country’s deficit-reduction plans agreed as part
of the European Union and International Monetary Fund’s bailout,
S&P said in a statement today. S&P, which also said the economy
may shrink more than it previously expected, cut the country’s
rating twice in March to BBB-, one level above junk status.  Portugal followed Greece and Ireland in April in seeking a
bailout as its borrowing costs surged. Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is cutting spending and raising taxes to meet the
terms of a 78 billion-euro ($104 billion) aid plan and the
government has already announced a one-time income-tax surcharge
to help cover a budget shortfall this year.  “We consider that the government of the Republic of
 Portugal  is strongly committed to following through with the EU-
IMF program,” S&P said. “However, the Portuguese economy is
likely to contract in the near term more severely than we
previously expected due to weaker external demand and tighter
credit conditions.”  Portugal’s credit rating was cut to below investment grade
in July by Moody’s Investors Service. The long-term government
bond ratings were lowered to Ba2 from Baa1, and the outlook is
negative, Moody’s said in a July 5 statement.  The  Portuguese government  aims to trim the  budget deficit 
from 9.8 percent of gross domestic product in 2010 to 5.9
percent in 2011 and to within the EU ceiling of 3 percent in
2013. Debt will reach 100.8 percent of GDP this year and peak at
106.8 percent in 2013 before starting to decline, the government
predicted on Aug. 31. Debt was 93.3 percent of GDP in 2010.  Portugal is “on track” to meet its 2011 deficit goal, a
team of EU and IMF inspectors said on Aug. 12. The IMF said in a
Sept. 13 report that the government needs to improve control
over expenditure and cut spending to meet its targets as it
seeks to regain access to bond markets in 2013.  Portugal’s economy will contract 2.2 percent this year and
between 2.2 percent and 2.3 percent in 2012, before expanding
1.2 percent in 2013, according to government forecasts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
