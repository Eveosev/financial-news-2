The collateral deal agreed yesterday
by euro area finance ministers doesn’t trigger so-called
negative pledge clauses, the Finnish  Finance Ministry  said in a
document distributed in Helsinki today.  The collateral deal done through Greek banks doesn’t change
the status of creditors, including the  International Monetary
Fund , the ministry said. About 10 percent of Greek bonds contain
negative pledge clauses, Martti Salmi, adviser at the ministry,
said at a press briefing today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
