A new standard that allows companies
to measure the carbon dioxide generated to make products may
spur competition among manufacturers based on environmental
credentials, including in the U.S., the Carbon Trust said.  The  World Resources Institute , the Washington-based
environment group, and the World Business Council for
 Sustainable Development  were among groups that developed the
Greenhouse Gas Protocol Product Lifecycle Standard, said Harry
Morrison, director of Carbon Trust Certification, which advises
U.K. and U.S. businesses on cutting emissions.  The standard will help businesses cut emissions and waste
in their supply chains and more confidently market the
“greenness” of products without leaving themselves open to
criticism, Morrison said today in a telephone interview. The
standard will allow low greenhouse-gas content of a company’s
products to be “at the heart of their competitive strategy,”
he said. The standard should make marketing claims more directly
comparable, he said.  Carbon Trust, based in  London  and part-funded by the U.K.
government, already certifies televisions produced by Seoul-
based  LG Electronics  Inc. and imported to  Europe . A pre-launch
version of the lifecycle standard has already being used by
Carbon Trust to help certify product footprints of  Newell
Rubbermaid Inc. (NWL) , for instance, Morrison said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
