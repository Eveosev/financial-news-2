Volvo AB (VOLVB) , the world’s second-largest
producer of heavy-duty vehicles, appointed a new chief financial
officer and said it will reorganize its truck business.  The truck division, currently separated into the Volvo,
Renault, Mack and UD brands, will now be organized into three
geographic segments: North and South America;  Europe , the  Middle
East  and Africa; and Asia and the Pacific, the Gothenburg,
Sweden-based company said in a statement. The changes will be
made by Jan. 1, 2012.  The reorganization is Olof Persson’s second major move
since taking over as chief executive officer on Sept. 1. Last
month, Volvo said it will set profit goals based on its leading
competitors’ performance, marking a shift in focus from growth
to profitability.  Anders Osberg, Volvo’s head of treasury, will succeed
Mikael Bratt as chief financial officer. Bratt will head a new
division that will oversee all production of trucks and engines.  Staffan Jufors, currently president of the truck business,
will retire at the end of the year, the company said.  Daimler AG is the largest producer of trucks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
