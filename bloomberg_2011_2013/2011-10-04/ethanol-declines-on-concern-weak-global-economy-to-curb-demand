Ethanol futures fell in  Chicago  on
concern that a weak global economy will curb fuel consumption.  The biofuel declined 1.7 percent and gasoline dropped 0.9
percent on speculation that European policy makers may have to
renegotiate terms of Greece’s bailout. Ethanol is blended with
gasoline to stretch supply and meet federal mandates.  “It’s all about outside markets,” said Mike Blackford, a
consultant at INTL FCStone in Des Moines,  Iowa . “It’s the
entire euro zone. Everyone’s worried about it.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery plummeted 4.2 cents
to $2.458 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have
risen 28 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for November delivery dropped 2.26 cents to settle
at $2.4884 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
lowest level since Feb. 11.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.505 a gallon and on the West Coast at $2.61,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  slid 0.5 cent to $2.58 a gallon and in
Chicago the biofuel decreased 0.5 cent to $2.475.  To contact the reporter on this story:
