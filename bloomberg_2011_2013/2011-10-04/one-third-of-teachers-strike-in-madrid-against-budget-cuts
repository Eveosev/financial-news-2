Thirty-two percent of teachers in the
region of  Madrid  struck today, according to the regional
education department, while the Comisiones Obreras union said
the figure was 71 percent.  Teachers protested for the fourth time in two weeks against
a two-hour increase in their weekly classroom time and cuts to
temporary staff. Madrid is governed by the  People’s Party , which
is in opposition nationally and leading Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero’s Socialists in polls before the Nov. 20
vote.  Protests against cuts to education budgets have also taken
place since the school year started in regions including Galicia
and Castilla-La Mancha, where PP deputy leader Maria Dolores de Cospedal won in May after three decades of Socialist rule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
