Billionaire energy trader  Gennady Timchenko  may acquire the 33 percent he doesn’t already own in
Transoil, the company bidding for OAO Russian Railways’s cargo
unit Freight One OJSC,  Kommersant  reported.  Timchenko may buy the stake from the main owners of
Globaltrans Investment Plc in exchange for his 10 percent
holding in Globaltrans’s Balttransservis rail cargo-carrier and
as much as $330 million in cash, the Moscow-based daily
reported, citing unidentified people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
