Mauritius’s rupee depreciated for a
second day against the dollar on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis
will worsen, curbing demand for riskier frontier-market assets.  The currency of the Indian Ocean island nation declined 1.7
percent to 29.50 per dollar by 11:47 a.m. in Port Louis, the
capital. A close at this level would be the weakest since Feb.
25, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Versus the euro,
the currency of its main trading partner, the rupee snapped two
days of gains, depreciating 1.3 percent to 38.9849. The rupee
lost 1.5 percent to 45.5694 per pound, the currency of
Mauritius’s largest buyer of manufactured goods.  European finance ministers have postponed a decision to
release  Greece ’s next loan installment until after Oct. 13. The
vote was originally scheduled for yesterday, as part of the 110
billion-euro ($145 billion) lifeline given to Greece last year.
The finance chiefs are considering “technical revisions” to a
July deal for a second Greek aid package, Luxembourg Prime
Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said today.  “Markets have gone awry very rapidly as details emerge
about the Greek situation,” analysts at  Mauritius Commercial
Bank (MCB) , the country’s largest lender by market value, wrote in an
e-mailed note to clients. “As Greece misses its budget-deficit
target, global markets are skittish.”  Mauritius, an open economy with a population of 1.3 million
people, derives 41 percent of its foreign-currency income in
euros, Bank of Mauritius data show. Visitors from Europe
accounted for 62 percent arrivals from January to August. The
U.K is the largest buyer of its exports by nation, with a share
of 22 percent for the six months through June, according to
 Statistics Mauritius . The island nation is a  net buyer of food
and fuels , with 67 percent of its import bills in dollars.  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 28.3848 to 28.5549
and the selling price rose to 29.8902 compared with 29.7468
yesterday, according to  exchange rates  published today on the
Bank of Mauritius website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
