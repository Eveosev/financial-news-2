OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP)  plunged to its lowest
in more than two years after Kommersant said the Russian coal
producer may miss its output target  The shares slid 13 percent to 78.51 rubles by the 6:45 p.m.
close in Moscow, the lowest since July 2009 and the biggest one-
day drop since May 2010.  Raspadskaya may produce less than 6.5 million metric tons
this year, missing its planned full-year output of 8.5 million
tons by 24 percent, Kommersant said, citing analystsâ€™ estimates.  The company produced 400,000 tons of coal a month in July
and August, compared with an average 576,000 tons a month in the
first half, the Moscow-based newspaper said, citing Metal-
Courier data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
