Turkey ’s central bank said inflation
will accelerate in the remainder of the year and
“significantly” exceed the target of 5.5 percent for the end
of 2011.  Increases to household electricity and gas prices this
month will add 0.5 percentage point to inflation, which is also
being driven by a fall in the value of the lira that pushes up
the cost of imported goods, the bank in Ankara said today in an
e-mailed comment. The inflation rate will start to decline again
in 2012, it said.  Central bank Governor Erdem Basci said Sept. 30 that
there’s a “high chance” the bank will meet its 5 percent goal
for inflation next year because economic growth is slowing. The
bank on Aug. 4 cut its benchmark one-week repo lending rate to a
historic low of 5.75 percent, and says more reductions may be
needed to cushion the economy against a slowdown in  Europe ,
Turkey’s biggest export market.  Inflation slowed to 6.2 percent last month from 6.7 percent
in August, the country’s statistics office said yesterday.  Core
inflation , excluding energy, food, tobacco and gold, accelerated
to 7 percent, the highest for 2 1/2 years.  The lira has declined 23 percent against the dollar in the
last 12 months, and fell to a record low of 1.8926 per dollar
today. Basci said on Sept. 30 that the lira’s losses were
“useful and sufficient,” and said the bank will not welcome
any further declines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
