Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (9107) ,  Japan ’s
third-largest shipping line, tumbled to the lowest in nine years
after scrapping a profit forecast and predicting a 30 billion
yen ($390 million) annual loss.  K-Line tumbled 4.5 percent to 148 yen in  Tokyo , its lowest
close since September 2002. Nippon Yusen K.K., Japan’s largest
shipping line, fell 4 percent to 194 yen and second-ranked
Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. dropped 3.9 percent to 268 yen.  Tokyo-based K-Line expects an unprofitable year because of
a 15.6 billion yen loss from investments, the stronger yen and
slumping container-shipping rates, it said in a  statement 
yesterday. Mitsui O.S.K. also last week forecast a loss in the
half-year ended Sept. 30, compared with an earlier prediction
for a profit.  “Kawasaki Kisen’s loss forecast is bigger than I
expected,” said  Ryota Himeno , an analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities Co. “It’s hard to see them returning
to profit next year with rates so low.”  K-Line expects its container unit to make a 33 billion yen
full-year current loss compared with an earlier prediction for a
10.5 billion yen loss, according to the statement. Container
lines were this year forced to delay the introduction of peak-
season surcharges on Asia-U.S. routes because of overcapacity
and slowing demand.  K-Line in July forecast 2 billion yen full-year net income.  To contact the reporters on this story:
