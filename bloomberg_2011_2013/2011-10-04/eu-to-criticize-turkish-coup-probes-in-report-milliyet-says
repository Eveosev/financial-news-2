The European Union plans to criticize
 Turkey ’s investigation into alleged coup plots and the country’s
deteriorating press freedoms in its annual progress report,
Milliyet  reported , citing a draft text.  The Ergenekon and Sledgehammer trials, targeting groups
accused of plotting against Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ,
are a concern because of a lack of information about the
evidence used to detain hundreds of suspects, the report will
say, according to Milliyet. The arrest of journalists under the
legal pretense of combating terrorism is another concern, the
newspaper said.  Turkey’s plan to rewrite its constitution is an opportunity
to guarantee democracy, the rule of law, human rights and
protection of minorities including the Kurds, the EU will say,
according to Milliyet. There is a lack of dialogue and no
consensus among Turkey’s political parties, according to the
draft report.  Cyprus, an EU member, is seeking to harden the report’s
stance on Turkey, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
