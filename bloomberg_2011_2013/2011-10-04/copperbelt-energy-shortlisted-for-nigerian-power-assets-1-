Copperbelt Energy Corp., the Zambian
company that distributes half of the electricity consumed in
that nation, was shortlisted to potentially buy three Nigerian
power distribution assets.  “We’re preparing the bids now,” Corporate Finance
Director Mutale Mukuka said today in an interview in
Johannesburg. If the company is successful, it may raise funds
to acquire the assets,  power lines  in Abuja, Lagos and Benin
city he said.  Copperbelt Energy, known as CEC, is building power plants
in  Zambia  to meet the needs of the expanding copper mining
industry and is looking to for opportunities in nearby nations
to grow sales.  The company is no longer interested in power generation
assets in  Nigeria , for which it was also shortlisted, Mukuka
said in a speech in Johannesburg today. The assets are being
offered by the government of Nigeria, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
