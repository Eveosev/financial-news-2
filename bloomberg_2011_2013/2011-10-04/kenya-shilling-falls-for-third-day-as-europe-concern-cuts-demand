Kenya ’s shilling weakened for a third
day against the dollar as concern that Europe’s debt crisis is
worsening cut demand for riskier assets.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 1.1 percent to 102.40 per dollar and traded 0.7
percent weaker at 102 by 1:34 p.m. in Nairobi.  European finance ministers have postponed a decision to
release Greece’s next loan installment until after Oct. 13. The
vote was originally scheduled for yesterday, as part of the 110
billion-euro ($145 billion) lifeline given to Greece last year.
The finance chiefs are considering “technical revisions” to a
July deal for a second Greek aid package, Luxembourg Prime
Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said today.  “The shilling is under pressure due to the unresolved euro
crisis which is causing a shift to less risky dollar-denominated
assets,” Jeremiah Kendagor, acting head of trading at Nairobi-
based Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview.  The shilling has depreciated 21 percent this year, making
it the world’s worst performer against the dollar. Inflation
accelerated for the eleventh consecutive month in September to
17.3 percent compared with 16.7 percent in August, more than
triple the government’s target, on rising food and fuel costs.  Prime Minister  Raila Odinga  last week formed a team of
government officials and industry leaders to devise ways to help
smooth volatility in the  currency market . The panel is expected
to release its recommendations this week.  The central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee meets
tomorrow, its second gathering in three weeks. In an emergency
session on Sept. 14, it raised its main  interest rate  by 0.75
percentage point to 7 percent.
