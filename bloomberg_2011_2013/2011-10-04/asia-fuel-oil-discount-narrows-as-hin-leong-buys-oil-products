Asia  fuel oil ’s discount to crude
shrank as Hin Leong Trading Pte bought a cargo for a second day
in  Singapore . Formosa Petrochemical Corp. lifted a force majeure
on fuel exports from its Mailiao refinery in  Taiwan .  Fuel Oil  Hin Leong purchased 20,000 metric tons of 380-centistoke
fuel oil from Gunvor Group Ltd. in Singapore, the region’s
biggest oil-trading center, according to a Bloomberg News survey
of traders monitoring transactions on the Platts window. The
closely held trader paid $618 a ton for Oct. 19 to Oct. 23, the
earliest loading period.  Fuel oil’s discount to Asian benchmark Dubai crude narrowed
29 cents to $2.09 a barrel at 2 p.m. Singapore time, based on
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. That’s the smallest
gap since Feb. 8, 2010, indicating reduced losses for refiners
turning crude into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade advanced 75 cents to $8.50 a ton, PVM said. This viscosity
spread is the widest in two weeks, signaling higher-quality fuel
oil has declined more than bunker, or marine fuel.  Middle Distillates  Hin Leong bought 250,000 barrels of 0.5 percent sulfur
gasoil from Lukoil OAO, according to the Bloomberg News survey.
Singapore-based Hin Leong received a discount of 10 cents a
barrel to average quotes for October.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, or the crack spread,
climbed 18 cents to $18.49 a barrel at 2 p.m. Singapore time,
based on PVM data. This measure of refining profit gained for a
fourth day, the longest rally in three months.  Jet fuel ’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after rising to
$2.80 a barrel, PVM said. This regrade was the highest since Feb.
23, indicating it is more profitable to produce  aviation fuel 
over diesel.  BP Plc bought 100,000 barrels of jet fuel from Morgan
Stanley at 10 cents a barrel over benchmark quotes, the survey
showed. BP has purchased at least seven cargoes since Sept. 22.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
dropped $7.49 to $96.22 a ton at 5:45 p.m. Singapore time, based
on data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread was the
narrowest since Sept. 15.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought two 50,000-barrel gasoline
cargoes from Vitol Group in Singapore, according to the
Bloomberg News survey. Shell, which declared force majeure Oct.
2 on supply from its Pulau Bukom refinery, paid $118.90 a barrel
for 97-RON grade and $116.80 for 95-RON. The cargoes will load
between Oct. 19 and Oct. 23.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha increased $1.45 to $21.30 a
barrel, the highest in three months, Bloomberg data showed. A
widening reforming margin means motor fuel is more profitable to
produce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
