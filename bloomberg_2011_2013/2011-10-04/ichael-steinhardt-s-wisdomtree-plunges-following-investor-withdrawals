WisdomTree Investments Inc., the New
York-based firm founded by former hedge-fund manager  Michael Steinhardt , had its worst three-day decline in three years,
after investors pulled money from its exchange-traded funds.  WisdomTree fell 1 cent, or 0.2 percent, to $5.98 at 4 p.m.
in Nasdaq stock market trading, bringing losses over the last
three trading days to 25 percent, the most since September 2008.
The company last week lost 5.9 percent of assets as a large
institutional investor withdrew money, Stuart Bell, a WisdomTree
spokesman, said yesterday in a telephone interview. Bell
declined to name the investor.  The company had $11 billion in assets as of yesterday,
according to the its  website .  WisdomTree, started in 2005, offers equity ETFs based on
proprietary indexes that weight member companies according to
cash dividends or earnings. Indexes traditionally weight
securities according to market capitalization. The company also
offers currency, fixed-income and alternative ETFs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
