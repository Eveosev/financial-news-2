Australia ’s central bank held its
benchmark interest rate for an 11th month as international
financial turmoil threatens growth and a weakening currency
boosts prospects for the nation’s manufacturers.  Governor  Glenn Stevens  left the overnight cash rate target
at 4.75 percent, according to a statement released today in
Sydney. The extended pause on borrowing costs matched the
prediction of all 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The Reserve Bank’s decision to maintain the developed
world’s highest borrowing costs reflects a slower global economy
that’s dimming the domestic growth outlook. Monthly employment
growth averaged 2,800 from January through August, less than a
10th of the average of 30,500 in the first eight months of 2010.  The Australian dollar dropped 9.8 percent last month
against the U.S. currency, the biggest monthly decline since
October 2008, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. triggered a worldwide credit crunch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
