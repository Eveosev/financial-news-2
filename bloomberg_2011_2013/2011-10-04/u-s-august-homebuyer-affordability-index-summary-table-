U.S. housing was more affordable
in August than the previous month, according to the National
Association of Realtors.  The composite homebuyer index rose to 183.7 in August from 
180.1 the prior month. A value of 100 means that a family with the 
national median income has exactly enough income to qualify 
for a mortgage on a median-priced home. An increase in the 
index means that a family is more likely to be able to afford 
the median priced house.  Following is a table compiled from the homebuyer
affordability index report:  SOURCE: National Association of Realtors
