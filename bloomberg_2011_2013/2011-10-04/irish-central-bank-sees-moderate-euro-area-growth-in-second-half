The euro-area economy will continue
to grow “moderately” for the remainder of the year as the
region grapples with the sovereign debt crisis and global
expansion slows, the Irish Central Bank said.  “The expansion in domestic demand is expected to remain at
a weak pace as austerity measures in many countries restrict
consumer and government spending while, against the backdrop of
the current global economic soft patch, export growth may also
be modest,” the Dublin-based central bank said in its quarterly
bulletin today.  Europe ’s leaders are struggling to prevent a Greek default
and contain the region’s fiscal crisis, which is roiling global
financial markets. Still, manufacturing in the U.S.,  China  and
the U.K. unexpectedly rebounded last month while production in
the euro region contracted less than initially estimated,
suggesting the global economy is more resilient than initially
estimated.  “Euro-area activity should continue to benefit from
ongoing growth in the global economy as well as from the
accommodative monetary policy stance and the various measures
taken to support the functioning of the financial sector,” the
Irish central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
