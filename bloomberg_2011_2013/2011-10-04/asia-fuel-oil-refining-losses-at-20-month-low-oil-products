Asia refining losses from  fuel oil 
narrowed to the lowest in almost 20 months while profits from
gasoil were near the highest in more than four weeks after Royal
Dutch Shell Plc shut refinery units in  Singapore .  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 8 cents, or 3.2
percent, to $2.30 a barrel at 11:04 p.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based
broker. The discount is the smallest since Feb. 8, 2010.  High-sulfur 180-centistoke fuel-oil swaps for October fell
$7, or 1.1 percent, to $606.50 a ton, PVM data showed.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade rose 75 cents to $8.50 a metric ton. The wider viscosity
spread indicates bunker fuel prices fell more than higher-
quality fuel oil.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude oil was at $18.29, down 2
cents, PVM data showed. This crack spread, a measure of refining
profit from the fuel, rose to $18.31 a barrel yesterday, the
highest since Sept. 1.  October swaps for gasoil dropped $1.25, or 1.1 percent, to
$113.90 a barrel. Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, or the regrade,
rose 5 cents to $2.85 a barrel.  Light Distillates  October swaps for naphtha, a petrochemicals and gasoline
feedstock, fell $8.75, or 1 percent, to $853 a ton, PVM data
showed.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures fell
to $92.82 a ton from $102.29 at the end of Asian trading
yesterday, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
