The  European Central Bank  should cut
 interest rates  immediately to counter growing economic risks,
 Handelsblatt  reported, citing a majority of members of the so-
called shadow ECB council.  The Frankfurt, Germany-based central bank should also
resume purchases of covered bonds and make long-term credit
facilities available to banks to help avert a possible credit
crunch, the newspaper said, citing members of the shadow council
that includes 15 economists and portfolio managers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
