Call centers that provide service to
Airtel Nigeria Ltd., which operates a mobile-phone network in
 Africa ’s most populous nation, were closed following threats
from former workers to damage facilities.  Sites in Abuja and Lagos were shut Sept. 30 after the
operators “failed to reach agreement with workers on new
employment terms,” said Emeka Opara, a spokesman for the unit of
 India ’s  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI)  The former employees threatened to
damage the facilities after their contracts weren’t renewed, he
said by phone today. The sites are operated by Tech Mahindra
Ltd. and Spanco Ltd., both of India, Opara said.  The contracts of 4,000 workers, which ended on Sept. 30
weren’t renewed as the companies sought new terms, Tech Mahindra
and Spanco said in an e-mailed statement today. There are “plans
to recruit new workers and offer some of the affected staff new
contracts based on their qualifications,” according to the
statement.  The Nigerian National Union of Postal and
Telecommunications Employees “will resist attempts by Airtel to
employ workers on contract or sever their employment in a manner
that contradicts the country’s labor laws,” said Alhassan
Sunday, the union’s president, by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
