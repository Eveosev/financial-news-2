Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT)  and  Mahindra &
Mahindra Ltd. (MM)  declined in Mumbai trading after riots and a
curfew imposed by the police in the northern Indian state of
Uttarakhand hurt production at their factories in the area.  Tata Motors,  India ’s biggest truckmaker, fell 4.5 percent
to 146.70 rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai trading, the
lowest since Sept. 14. The stock was the third-worst performer
on the benchmark BSE India Sensitive Index, which lost 1.8
percent. Mahindra, the nation’s biggest tractor manufacturer,
dropped 4.2 percent, the most since Aug. 4, to 776.80 rupees.  Production at Tata’s Pantnagar factory that has a capacity
to make 300,000 vehicles a year was partially affected after the
curfew, Debasis Ray, a spokesman for the Mumbai-based owner of
Jaguar and  Land Rover , said by phone. Mahindra halted production
of tractors in Rudrapur starting yesterday, Pawan Goenka,
president of the company’s automotive and farm equipment unit,
said in a telephone interview.  The local administration will decide when to lift the
curfew in Rudrapur, Rajeev Gupta, the top bureaucrat in charge
of security in Uttarakhand said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
