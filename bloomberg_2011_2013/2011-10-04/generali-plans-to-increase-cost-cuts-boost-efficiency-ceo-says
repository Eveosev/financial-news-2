Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) ,  Europe ’s
third-biggest insurer, plans to increase cost reductions amid
global “financial volatility,” Chief Executive Officer
Giovanni Perissinotto said.  The firm plans to cut information-technology costs and
improve the efficiency of asset and real-estate management
“through the full integration of these functions across the
whole group,” the CEO said today at a conference held by
Merrill Lynch in  London . His comments were confirmed by a
company spokeswoman.  Trieste, Italy-based Generali, which is expanding in
emerging markets including  China  and the Middle East to boost
profit, expects higher operating margins in the life and non-
life businesses this year. The insurer’s second-quarter profit
fell 45 percent, hurt by writedowns of Greek bonds and its stake
in Telco SpA.  “We have to be ready to live in a world characterized by
stagnant growth, low returns and great financial volatility,”
Perissinotto said. “This adverse trend is accentuated by the
lack of decisiveness and coordination of actions.”  About 94 percent of the company’s government bond holdings
have an A rating or higher, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
