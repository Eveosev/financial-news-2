The pound declined against higher-
yielding currencies before a report that is predicted to show
construction growth slowed in September, strengthening the case
for more stimulus from the  Bank of England .  Sterling weakened against 11 of its 16 major counterparts,
falling most versus the  New Zealand dollar . A gauge of building
activity from  Markit Economics  Ltd. and the  Chartered Institute
of Purchasing and Supply , probably slipped to 51.6 from 52.6 in
August, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  The pound fell 0.1 percent to 85.48 pence per euro at 7:09
a.m. in  London . Sterling was 0.2 percent stronger at $1.5461 and
118.46 yen. It fell 0.6 percent to 2.0384 New Zealand dollars.  It is becoming “increasingly probable” that another round
of government-bond purchases may be needed to boost the economy,
Bank of England policy makers said in the minutes of its Sept. 8
policy meeting. The central bank has the tools available to
provide additional “monetary loosening” should the economy
continue to deteriorate, Chief Economist Spencer Dale said in an
interview with the  Daily Mail  published on Sept. 29.  At the same time, accelerating inflation means a resumption
is not a “no brainer,” he said. The central bank announces its
next interest-rate and bond buying decisions on Oct. 6.  A report yesterday showed a surprise expansion of U.K.
manufacturing in September. The gauge of U.K. factory output
rose to 51.1 from 49.4 in August, a survey by Markit Economics
and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply showed.  That was higher than the 48.5 median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
