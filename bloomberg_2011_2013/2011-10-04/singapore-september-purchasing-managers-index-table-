Following is a table of Purchasing Managersâ€™
Index figures for September compiled by the  Singapore  Institute of Purchasing
& Materials Management.  Note: Figures are compiled from a monthly survey of purchasing executives   in over 150 industrial companies in Singapore.  A reading below 50 points indicates a general contraction of the  manufacturing economy while a reading above 50 points would indicate  an expansion. The 3-month moving average is calculated by Bloomberg.  Source: Singapore Institute of Purchasing & Materials Management.  To contact the reporter on this story:
