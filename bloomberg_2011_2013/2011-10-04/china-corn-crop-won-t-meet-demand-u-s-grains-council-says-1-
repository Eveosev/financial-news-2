China , the world’s second-biggest
corn consumer, won’t have enough supplies to meet rising
domestic demand even as farmers harvest a record crop, the U.S.
Grains Council said after completing a 15th annual field tour.  Consumption may total 170.1 million metric tons (6.7
billion bushels) in the year that started Oct. 1, Thomas C. Dorr, the council’s president and chief executive officer, said
today on a conference call with reporters. That would be the
most ever and outpace domestic production, he said. Farmers may
produce 166.6 million tons this year, up 5.6 percent from last
season, Kevin Rempp, a member of the council’s Asian advisory
team and an Iowa corn farmer, said on the call.  “China will still need to import corn,” Rempp said.  Before today, prices in  Chicago  jumped 27 percent in the
past year as adverse weather threatened Midwest crops amid
rising demand for supplies from the U.S., the biggest grower,
consumer and exporter. China, the second-largest producer, may
need to import 5 million to 10 million tons from global
suppliers before the end of 2012 to replenish depleted
inventories, Dorr said.  Farmers will harvest an average of 85.9 bushels of corn per
acre from an estimated 76.35 million acres this year, up from an
average yield of 84.7 bushels from 73.82 million acres, Rempp
said today after sampling fields with U.S. and Chinese grain
traders, government officials and other council members from
Sept. 12 to Sept. 30.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  forecast China’s
production at 178 million tons this season, up 2.9 percent from
a year earlier, and pegged consumption 6.1 percent higher at
182.5 million tons. Imports will climb 54 percent to 2 million
tons, the USDA said on Sept 12. The department will update its
global crop outlook on Oct. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
