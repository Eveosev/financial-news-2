Parents of women with polycystic
ovary syndrome are more likely to have some form of
cardiovascular disease, researchers in  Australia  found.  Scientists at the University of Adelaide studied the
medical histories of more than 700 women born in the mid 1970s
to find the link, they said in a statement. The research is
published today in the online journal PLosONE.  Polycystic ovary syndrome is a hormonal disorder affecting
about 10 percent of women of reproductive age. It is one of the
most common endocrine disorders in women and a leading cause of
infertility, the researchers said.  Mothers of women with the ailment are more likely to have
any form of cardiovascular disease, and almost twice as likely
to have high  blood pressure , than mothers of women without the
condition, the scientists said. Fathers of women with the
syndrome are more than twice as likely to have  heart disease ,
and more than four times as likely to have a stroke.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
