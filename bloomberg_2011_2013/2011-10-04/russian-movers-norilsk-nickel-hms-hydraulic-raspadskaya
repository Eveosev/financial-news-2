The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  plunged 5.7
percent to 1,267.77 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, paring an
earlier loss of as much as 7.6 percent. The dollar-denominated
RTS Index declined 5.2 percent to 1,224.92 rubles.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis.  HMS Hydraulic Machines & Systems Group Plc (HMSG LI) gained
for the first day in five after the Russian machinery maker said
first-half profit rose fivefold. The London-listed shares
climbed 0.5 percent to $4.50.  OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP)   plunged to its lowest in more
than two years after Kommersant reported the Russian coal
producer may produce less than 6.5 million metric tons this
year, missing its output target by 24 percent, citing analysts’
estimates. The shares fell 13 percent to 78.51 rubles in Moscow,
lowest close since July 2009 and the biggest one-day fall since
May 2010.  OAO Sberbank (SBER03 RX), the nation’s largest bank,
dropped by the most in two weeks, losing 8.5 percent to 62.53
rubles, after the Russian currency fell for a fifth day against
the dollar. A weaker ruble encourages Russians to withdraw and
convert ruble deposits, Sberbank’s main source of funding.  VTB Group (VTBR RX),  Russia ’s second-largest bank, fell to
its lowest level since November 2009, losing 7.2 percent to
6.107 kopeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
