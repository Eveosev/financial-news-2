PKN Orlen SA headed for its lowest
close in a week as  Poland ’s biggest oil refiner said it will
post losses of “several hundred million” zloty from the
revaluation of foreign-currency debt after the country’s
currency slumped.  The shares tumbled as much as 7.1 percent to 32.5 zloty and
traded 4.6 percent lower at 33.4 zloty by 11:34 a.m. in Warsaw,
extending this year’s decline to 27 percent.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS) , the
country’s second-largest refiner, lost 5.1 percent to 22.74
zloty, while Poland’s benchmark WIG20 Index fell 3.4 percent to
2,073.62 today.  Orlen, based in Plock, central Poland, will book the
financial losses in the third quarter, Chief Financial Officer
Slawomir Jedrzejczyk said today.  The Polish zloty lost 10 percent of its value against the
euro and 17 percent against the dollar in the July-September
period, making it the worst performing currency tracked by
Bloomberg last quarter.  Orlen, whose first-half net income was 2 billion zloty
($601 million), had net debt at 7.9 billion zloty at the end of
June, according to a presentation on its website. Eighty-six
percent of its gross debt was denominated in euros and dollars,
the presentation showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
