Georgian inflation will continue to
slow through the end of 2011 after easing for a fourth month in
September, the head of the Statistics Office said.  Inflation will average 6 percent a year for several years,

Tbilisi, citing projections by the central bank.  Consumer prices advanced 4.6 percent in September from a
year earlier compared with 7.2 percent in August, the statistics
office said yesterday. Prices rose 0.6 percent from the previous
