Warren Buffett , the billionaire
chairman of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , said his company’s
announcement last month that it will repurchase shares reflects
his view that the stock was undervalued.  “We will buy our stock when we think it’s selling for less
than it’s worth,” Buffett, 81, said today at Fortune magazine’s
Most Powerful Women conference in Laguna Niguel,  California .  To contact the reporter on this story:
