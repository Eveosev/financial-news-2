Opposition among  Germany ’s coalition
parties against  Greece ’s second aid package is rising,  Bild 
newspaper reported.  If observers from the European Commission, the  European
Central Bank  and the  International Monetary Fund  questioned the
feasibility of a second bailout plan, the same would hold true
for Germany’s lower house of parliament,  Michael Fuchs , the
 Christian Democratic Union ’s deputy leader in the Bundestag, was
quoted as saying by the newpaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
