U.S. crude-oil inventories probably
rose for a second week as imports extended the biggest one-week
gain in three years, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Inventories gained 1.5 million barrels, or 0.4 percent, to
342.5 million in the seven days ended Sept. 30, according to the
median of 15 analyst estimates before a weekly Energy Department
report tomorrow. Nine of the respondents projected a stockpile
increase and six estimated a drop.  Crude oil imports climbed 16 percent in the week ended
Sept. 23 to 9.7 million barrels a day as shipments recovered
following the shut-ins of rigs and platforms caused by Tropical
Storms Lee and Nate and  Hurricane Irene . It was the biggest one-
week gain since Sept. 26, 2008.  Supplies rose “as imports should remain at somewhat
elevated levels,” Tom Pawlicki, a Chicago-based analyst with MF
Global Holdings Ltd., said in a report. Last week’s gain was
“prompted by recovery from Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm
Lee earlier in the month. That brought the rate of import from
8.35 million barrels a day to 9.7 million barrels a day, which
in both cases is near the low and high ranges for the year.”  The oil survey responses ranged from a 4 million-barrel
increase to a 2.75 million-barrel decline. Supplies increased by
1.92 million barrels to 341 million barrels in the week ended
Sept. 23, the first advance following three weeks of declines.  Refinery Rates  Refineries operated at 87.3 percent of capacity last week,
down 0.5 percentage point, according to the median of 14 survey
responses. Refiners perform maintenance in the autumn and
spring, between the peak demand periods for gasoline in the
summer and heating oil in the winter.  Crude oil stockpiles “usually show builds through mid-
October before they begin leveling off,” Pawlicki said.
“Increased refinery maintenance is a big reason.”  Gasoline inventories increased 1.5 million barrels, or 0.7
percent, to 216.4 million in the week ended Sept. 30, according
to the responses. Thirteen of the analysts estimated a gain and
two said there was a decline.  Supplies of distillate fuel, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, decreased 300,000 barrels, or 0.2
percent, to 157.4 million last week, the survey showed. Nine of
the respondents predicted a drop and six said inventories rose.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its weekly
report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
