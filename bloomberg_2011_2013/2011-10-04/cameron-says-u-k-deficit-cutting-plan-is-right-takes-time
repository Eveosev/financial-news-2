U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said his government’s deficit-reduction plan is “right,” will
take time, and isn’t enough on its own to boost growth.  “We’ve got to get on top of the debt and deficit. If you
don’t do that, you can get into a situation where  interest rates 
are going up,” Cameron told BBC television today in Manchester,
northwest England, where his Conservative Party is
holding its annual conference. “Low interest rates alone aren’t
enough. We’ve got to take more action to get that money into the
banks and the businesses.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
