Doctors who want to work in the
 National Health Service  in  England  will have to prove they can
speak a good standard of English, U.K. Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said.  The move follows a case three years ago in which a patient
in Cambridgeshire, eastern England, died after he was given an
overdose of painkillers by a German doctor, Daniel Ubani, who
was working on his first shift in Britain.  “There is considerable anxiety amongst the public about
the ability of doctors to speak English properly,” Lansley,
who’s attending the annual conference of his  Conservative Party 
in Manchester, northwest England, said in an  e-mailed statement 
today. “We will amend the legislation to prevent all foreign
doctors with a poor grasp of English from working in England. If
you can’t speak adequate English, you can’t treat patients.”  The  Department of Health  said it will give the  General
Medical Council , which registers doctors to practice medicine in
the U.K., explicit powers to take action against doctors when
there are concerns about their ability to speak English.  To contact the reporter on this story:
