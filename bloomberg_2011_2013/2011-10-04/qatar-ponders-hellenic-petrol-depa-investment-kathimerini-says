Qatar may invest in  Hellenic
Petroleum SA (ELPE)  and Depa SA, which are on  Greece ’s list of state-
asset sales,  Kathimerini  reported, without saying how it
obtained the information.  Greece is looking for strategic investors and Qatar, which
agreed on Oct. 1 to invest about 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion)
in Greek mining companies, sees Depa and Hellenic Petroleum as
a way into  Europe ’s natural-gas market, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
