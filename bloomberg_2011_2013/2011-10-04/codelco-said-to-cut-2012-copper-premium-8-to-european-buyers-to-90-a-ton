Codelco , the world’s largest copper
producer, cut the premium charged to European buyers next year
by 8 percent amid a slowdown in developed economies, according
to two people familiar with the matter.  The reduction to $90 a metric ton comes after the surcharge
was raised 23 percent to $98 on deliveries this year, according
to the people, who declined to be identified because the terms
are confidential. The premium is added to the price of copper
for immediate delivery on the London Metal Exchange to cover
costs including shipping and insurance.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its 2012 estimate for
three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange to $9,200 a
metric ton from $10,790. The price fell 29 percent to $6,841 a
ton this year, after prices reached a record $10,190 on Feb. 15.  Commodities declined today to the lowest level in 10 months
as European policy makers were still to reach an agreement on
the region’s rescue fund, deepening concern that slower economic
growth may curb demand for raw materials. Goldman cut its global
growth forecasts and predicted recessions in Germany and  France .  Codelco has had “some interest” from clients in reducing
orders for the metal, Hernandez said Sept. 13. Other clients
increased orders, compensating for the losses, he said.  The Santiago-based company sold 23 percent of its copper to
 Europe  in the first six months of this year, compared with 19
percent a year ago, according to a Sept. 13 presentation. Sales
to  China  fell to 32 percent of Codelco’s total sales, compared
with 41 percent a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
