The trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff’s firm said he’ll start distributing money tomorrow,
starting with $312 million to go to victims of the fraud who
have approved claims.  The trustee,  Irving Picard , said today in a statement that
he’ll begin paying the money to the holders of 1,230 Madoff
accounts, reimbursing 4.6 percent of the money they lost in
Madoff’s Ponzi scheme.  “This initial distribution is the first return of stolen
funds to Madoff’s defrauded customers,” Picard said in the
statement. “Significant, additional funds -- currently
unavailable for distribution due primarily to appeals -- will
ultimately be returned to their rightful owners, as well as
future monies yet to be recovered. The need among many Madoff
customers is urgent, and we are working to expedite these
distributions.”  Picard has filed more than 1,000 suits against banks,
feeder funds, former Madoff investors and others he claims
profited from the fraud. Picard said he has recovered about
$8.7 billion, or about half the $17.3 billion in principal he
claims was lost.  The main case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-ap-1789,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York  ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
