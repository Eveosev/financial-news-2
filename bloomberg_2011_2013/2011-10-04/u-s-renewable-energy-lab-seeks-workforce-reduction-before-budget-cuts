The U.S.  National Renewable Energy
Laboratory  is offering employees buyouts to try to cut its
workforce in preparation for expected government budget cuts.  The lab, funded by the U.S. Energy Department, expects to
shed 100 to 150 employees, about 9 percent of its staff, said
Bob Noun, a spokesman for the lab. The buyouts will be offered
to 1,350 full- and part-time employees who’ve been at the lab
for at least a year, Noun said in a telephone interview today.  The lab, based in Golden,  Colorado , is the only federal
facility dedicated to research, development and deployment of
renewable energy and energy efficiency, according to its
website. It has 1,700 regular employees in a workforce of 2,600
including construction workers and subcontractors. The lab’s
budget dropped $50 million to $333 million in fiscal year 2011,
Noun said.  “We see the budget realities in the current fiscal year
and in the near future dictating that we begin to reduce our
operating budget,” he said. The buyouts are “a way of reducing
our costs for the coming year but also preserving our critical
mission capabilities at the lab.”  Workers have until Oct. 14 to apply for a buyout and lab
managers can reject applications from those with critical
skills. The buyout includes as much as 26 weeks of pay,
depending on length of service, and health insurance for as much
as three years.  The U.S. government hasn’t yet approved spending for the
2012 fiscal year and Noun said he doesn’t know how much NREL’s
budget will be cut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
