BG Group Plc (BG/) ,  Eni SpA (ENI)  and their
partners in the Karachaganak oil venture expect to reach an
agreement on expanding the project with the Kazakh government
this year, said Chris Finlayson, BG’s executive vice president
and managing director for Europe & Central Asia.  The government has said it will allow the expansion only
after entering the venture. KazMunaiGaz National Co., the state
energy producer, may acquire a 10 percent stake in Karachaganak,
the Central Asian nation’s only major oil development in which
the government doesn’t have a stake.  Kazakhstan won’t drop tax claims against the venture during
negotiations, Oil and Gas Minister Sauat Mynbayev said today at
a conference in Astana, the capital of  Kazakhstan .  Finlayson declined to comment on the stake or the tax
claims. He was speaking today with reporters at the conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
