German stocks fell for a third day
amid concern the European debt crisis will hurt the economic
recovery and that private bondholders face increased losses on
Greek debt.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  dropped 4.3 percent after abandoning its
2011 profit forecast and announcing more job cuts.  Volkswagen
AG (VOW) ,  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  and  Daimler AG (DAI)  plunged more than
4 percent as carmakers tumbled amid concern that growth is
slowing.  The benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  slid 3 percent to 5,216.71 at the
5:30 p.m. close in  Frankfurt , extending its three-day slump to
7.5 percent. The gauge fell 25 percent last quarter, its biggest
drop since 2002, amid concern the global economy is stalling and
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis is spreading. The broader HDAX
Index lost 3.2 percent today.  “Beyond Deutsche Bank, the stocks pulling the DAX down are
mainly cyclical,” said Alexander Kraemer, a cross-asset
strategist at  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  in Frankfurt. “ Greece  seems to be
in the headlines wherever you look, but the underlying problem
is that the Greek situation may result in a mild recession in
the euro zone and that weighs on cyclical stocks.”  Euro-area finance ministers meeting yesterday considered
reshaping the private sector’s 50 billion-euro ($66 billion)
involvement in July’s 159 billion-euro rescue. The package
included debt exchange and rollover. The talks came after seven
countries including  Germany , Europe’s largest economy, weighed
calling for Greek bond writedowns of as much as 50 percent, two
European officials said.  Banks Slide  Deutsche Bank, the country’s biggest lender, fell 4.3
percent to 24.64 euros after the company cut its 2011 profit
forecast and announced 500 job cuts. The bank said an indirect
tax position weighed on its third-quarter earnings.  Commerzbank, Germany’s second-largest bank, tumbled 4
percent to 1.69 euros, extending a three-day decline to 16
percent.  Allianz SE (ALV) , Europe’s biggest insurer, retreated 2.7
percent to 66.92 euros.  Volkswagen, Europe’s largest automaker, fell 7.1 percent to
88.54 euros amid concern that demand for luxury cars in  China  is
slowing. BMW lost 4.4 percent to 45.04 euros and Daimler plunged
5.7 percent to 30.97 euros.  In Beijing, BMW dealerships are giving markdowns of as much
as 19 percent on a 3-series car, while some Mercedes dealers are
selling the C-Class Elegance model at 20 percent less than the
suggested retail price, according to cheshi.com, a pricing guide
tracking more than 3,000 dealers in the country.  Lufthansa AG, Europe’s second-biggest airline, fell 4.3
percent to 8.98 euros.  Tony Tyler , chief executive officer of
the  International Air Transport Association , said that airlines
will generate net income equal to 0.8 percent of revenue next
year, a margin that may shrink further if economic growth slows
to less than 2.4 percent.  HeidelbergCement AG (HEI) , the world’s third-largest maker of
cement, tumbled 9 percent to 24.57 euros as European
construction stocks declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
