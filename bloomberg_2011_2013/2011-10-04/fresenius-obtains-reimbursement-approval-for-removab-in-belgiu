Fresenius Biotech said the Belgian
Health Ministry added its trifunctional antibody Removab to the
list of reimbursable medications as of Oct. 1. The use of
Removab will be reimbursed if the eligible patients also fulfill
defined additional clinical inclusion criteria, the company said
in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
