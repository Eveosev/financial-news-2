Argentina  may issue bonds next year
to finance obligations, according to a filing to the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.  In 2012, the government “is planning to finance debt
services with a variety of sources, including: primary surplus,
new debt from multilateral organizations, intra public sector
issuances, new debt issuances in the market and liability
management operations aimed at alleviating debt services,” the
Sept. 30  filing , known as an 18-k, says.  The government made a similar statement last year and
hasn’t sold bonds since.  Argentina has been blocked from international debt markets
since its record $95 billion default in 2001. The government’s
SEC filing doesn’t specify whether it would issue debt locally
or in international markets.  The government will have to pay 44.8 billion pesos ($10.7
billion) in interest payments for bonds issued in the 2005
restructuring next year, while 176.4 billion pesos of principal
payments are due, according to the statement.  Argentina owes an additional $8.9 billion in principal and
penalties to the Paris Club group of creditor nations, which
includes the U.S., Germany and  Japan , the filing said.
Negotiations over how to pay that debt are continuing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
