Japanese stocks fell for a fourth day,
sending the Topix index to its longest losing streak in seven
weeks, as a downgrade of  Italy ’s debt rating overshadowed signs
 Europe  may reach a consensus on measures to shield its banks
from the region’s debt crisis.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) ,  Japan ’s second-
biggest lender by market value, dropped 2.3 percent. Tokyo
Electric Power Co., the utility at the center of the worst
nuclear disaster in 25 years, led utilities lower after a report
that Trade Minister  Yukio Edano  will review a framework for
power rates. Fast Retailing Co. dropped 4 percent after JPMorgan
Chase & Co. cut its rating on the operator of the Uniqlo
clothing chain to “underweight.”  The Topix slid 1.4 percent to 726.25 at the 3 p.m. trading
close in Tokyo, its lowest level since March 2009. The gauge has
fallen 25 percent from a Feb. 21 high amid an escalating crisis
in Europe and slowing U.S. economic growth. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock
Average declined 0.9 percent to 8,382.98 today.  “No concrete measures on solving Europe’s crisis have come
out,” said Hitoshi Asaoka, a senior strategist in Tokyo at
Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., a unit of Japan’s third-largest
listed bank. “There won’t be an end to the market’s volatility
until we see something that will calm the situation.”  ‘Shared View’  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index fell 0.2 percent
today. The index finished up 2.3 percent yesterday in  New York ,
reversing a loss in the final 50 minutes of trading, after the
Financial Times quoted  Olli Rehn , European Union commissioner
for economic affairs, as saying there’s an “increasingly shared
view” that the region needs a coordinated approach to halt the
sovereign debt crisis.  Italy’s credit rating was cut by Moody’s Investors Service
after U.S. markets closed. The downgrade, the first in almost
two decades, came on concern that weak economic growth will
prevent Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s government from
reducing the region’s second-largest debt.  Moody’s lowered Italy’s rating three levels to A2 from Aa2,
with a negative outlook, the New York-based company said in a
statement yesterday. The action followed a cut by Standard &
Poor’s on Sept. 20.  Banks were the heaviest contributor to losses on the Topix.
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group slid 2.3 percent to 2,066 yen,
and  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender
by market value, fell 1.8 percent to 325 yen.  Topix Target Cut  Japanese stocks also fell after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
cut its 12-month target for the Topix by 8.4% to 870 from 950,
according to a report dated yesterday. Slowing global growth may
weigh on earnings, the investment bank said.  Tokyo Electric led utilities lower after the Asahi
newspaper quoted trade minister Edano as saying he would review
the framework for Japan’s electricity prices. Japan’s largest
power company plunged 12 percent to 203 yen. Kansai Electric
Power Co., the No. 2 utility, dropped 4.2 percent to 1,239 yen.  Fast Retailing fell 4 percent to 13,340 yen after JPMorgan
cut its rating on the stock to “underweight’ from “neutral’
and reduced the share price target to 12,800 yen from 13,300 yen.
Separately, the clothier said domestic sales fell 10.7 percent
last month at its Uniqlo stores open for at least 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
