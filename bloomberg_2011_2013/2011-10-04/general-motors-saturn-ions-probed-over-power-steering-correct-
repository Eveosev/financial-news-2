(Corrects second paragraph to specify yesterday.)  General Motors Co. (GM)  Saturn Ion cars
are under investigation by the U.S. auto-safety regulator
following reports of accidents and injuries linked to sudden
power-steering failure.  The  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
announced the probe of the 2004 to 2007 model years following
846 complaints it has received and 3,489 identified by GM about
sudden loss of power steering, the regulator said yesterday on
its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
