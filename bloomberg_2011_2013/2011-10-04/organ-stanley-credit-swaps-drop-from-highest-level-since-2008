The cost to protect the debt of
 Morgan Stanley (MS)  against losses fell from the highest levels in
about three years after a report that European Union officials
were examining ways to coordinate the recapitalization of
struggling banks.  Credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley fell 13 basis points
to 570 basis points as of 4:01 p.m. in New York, according to
broker Phoenix Partners Group. The contracts earlier traded as
high as 650 basis points, the highest since October 2008, the
month after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy.  The Financial Times quoted  Olli Rehn , European commissioner
for economic affairs, as saying there is an “increasingly shared
view” that the region needs a coordinated approach to halt the
sovereign debt crisis.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
