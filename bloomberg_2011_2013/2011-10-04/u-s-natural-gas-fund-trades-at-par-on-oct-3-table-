The U.S. Natural Gas Fund, the
largest exchange-traded fund in the fuel, closed at a Trades at Par
on Oct. 3, according to figures on the fundâ€™s website. A trade at par
means that the closing price of the shares is the same as than the
value of its underlying holdings in the fuel.  Natural gas for November delivery fell 4.9 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $3.617 per million British thermal units on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  on Oct. 3.  NOTE: To sidestep position limits imposed by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, the fund buys bilateral,
over-the-counter swaps that are not subject to exchange
limits. These swaps are fully collateralized with investment
grade counterparties.  The fund aims to track the price of natural gas delivered
at  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana , the delivery point for the
future traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The ETF
buys the near-month contract, then rolls forward by selling it
before expiration and buying the following month.  SOURCE: United States Natural Gas Fund  To contact the reporter on this story:
