Enlighted Inc., a closely held
provider of lighting controls for buildings, received $14.2
million in venture capital financing from Kleiner Perkins
Caufield & Byers, Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Intel 
Capital Corp.  The company will use the funding to develop sensors and
control systems that it says may reduce by 50 percent to 75 
percent the energy used for lighting in buildings, Sunnyvale,
California-based Enlighted said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
