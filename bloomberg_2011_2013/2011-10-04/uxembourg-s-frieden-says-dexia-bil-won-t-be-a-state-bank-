Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc Frieden said  Dexia SA (DEXB) ’s Luxembourg unit is a “solid bank” and
won’t be taken over by the government.  Dexia Banque Internationale a Luxembourg SA has “no
liquidity problem,” Frieden told reporters today in Luxembourg.
While “the Luxembourg government will take an active part in
the restructuring” of the Dexia group, the Luxembourg operation
“won’t be a  state bank ,” he said.  France and  Belgium  said today that they will take “all
necessary measures” to protect Dexia clients and will guarantee
the bank’s loans after shares of the lender plunged on concern
it will require a second government bailout. Belgium’s cabinet
will meet in Brussels tonight to review the options for the
group.  “All instruments are in place so that Group Dexia won’t
have any greater difficulties during this restructuring phase,”
Frieden said. “It’s a problem of a restructuring within the
priorities that are set by shareholders.”  Frieden said the Luxembourg government’s participation
“will exclusively relate to the Luxembourg part.” The
government seeks “to make sure that the retail activities of
that bank in Luxembourg will be maintained and even more, can be
expanded in the future,” he said.  “The Luxembourg state has great interest that Dexia BIL
remains a large and important bank and economic actor and this
isn’t questioned,” Frieden said. “Deposits in this bank are at
all times secure.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
