India ’s rupee dropped for a third day
on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will damp demand for exports
from  Asia ’s third-biggest economy.  Annual growth in overseas shipments slumped to 44 percent
in August from 82 percent in July, government data showed
yesterday. The nation’s current account, a broad measure of
trade and investment flows, showed a deficit of $14.1 billion in
the three months ended June, compared with a shortfall of $5.4
billion the prior quarter, the central bank said last week. The
MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares fell after European
governments signaled that bond holders may have to take bigger
losses on Greek debt.  “The  euro zone  is slowly losing hope and they will have to
cut  interest rates ,” said J. Moses Harding, a Mumbai-based
vice-president at IndusInd Bank Ltd. “That will benefit the
dollar and pressure the rupee. Growth concerns also remain.”  The rupee weakened 0.5 percent to 49.40 per dollar at the 5
p.m. close in Mumbai, the biggest loss since Sept. 22, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has dropped 9.5 percent so far
this year, the worst performance among Asia’s 10 most-traded
currencies.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 50.05 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations for a
rate of 49.93 yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
