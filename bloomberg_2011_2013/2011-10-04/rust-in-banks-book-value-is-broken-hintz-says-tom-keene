Bank stocks may drop further on
concern a sovereign debt default in Europe would hamper lenders’
ability to liquidate assets, said Brad Hintz, an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.  “The belief in book value has been broken,” Hintz said
today in a radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with
Tom Keene. “Is there a floor in these stocks? I wish I could
tell you there was.”  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  are
trading at more than a third below book value amid Europe’s
sovereign debt woes and slowing global growth. Firms may have a
difficult time valuing their holdings in the event of a default
by Greece, creating uncertainty among investors as market
liquidity seizes up, said Hintz, who is based in New York.  Financial shares in Europe are under pressure as regulators
struggle to quell concern that their lenders may be hurt by the
debt crisis. Banks with global franchises that “generate great
returns in normal market conditions” and that are implicitly
backed by the government may still tumble because “fear is
driving everything,” Hintz said.  The 81-company Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials Index has
plummeted 31 percent since the start of the year. The Bloomberg
Europe Banks and Financial Services Index of 46 firms has
dropped 36 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
