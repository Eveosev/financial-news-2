F5 Networks Inc. (FFIV)  gained the most in
almost a year after a William Blair & Co. analyst said he
expects the software maker to report fourth-quarter improvement
as demand for its website-performance products increases.  F5 rose $7.20, or 10 percent, to $77.63, at 4 p.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, the most since Oct. 27,
2010. The Seattle-based company was among the top performers in
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  “After three underwhelming quarters in a row, our channel
checks indicate a significantly improved performance for F5,”
in the quarter ended Sept. 30, Jason Ader, an analyst with
Chicago-based William Blair, wrote in a research note to clients
today. He cited “materially improved demand both in the  United
States  and abroad for F5’s application delivery controller (ADC)
products, across enterprise, government, and service-provider
customers.”  Ader, who rates the shares “outperform,” said he expects
F5 Networks to report $310 million in revenue for the quarter,
topping the average analyst estimate of $309 million from 32
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Sales in the fiscal third quarter ended June 30 totaled
$291 million, the company reported July 20. F5 said it
experienced a revenue decline in  Europe  and slower growth in the
U.S. government in the fiscal third quarter.  James Ramsay, a company spokesman, didn’t immediately
respond to a call and e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
