BOC Hong Kong (Holdings) Ltd. and
 Wing Hang Bank Ltd. (302)  led declines among lenders in Hong Kong
trading on concern that contagion from Europe’s debt crisis may
spill over to Asia and hinder growth.  BOC Hong Kong, a unit of Bank of China Ltd., fell 7.3
percent, its steepest slide in almost three years, to close at
HK$14.52. Wing Hang Bank dropped 7.9 percent to HK$56.15, the
lowest in more than two years.  Hong Kong stocks fell for a fourth day amid waning optimism
that European policy makers will resolve the region’s debt
crisis. The city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI) , which has slumped
29 percent this year, fell 3.4 percent today.  “The worsening European crisis is adding to investors’
concerns,” Ivan Li, deputy head of research at Kim Eng
Securities  Hong Kong  Ltd., said by telephone today. “Investors
are worried about the spillover effects on the lenders.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
