     Oct. 4 (Bloomberg) --TNK-BP, Russia’s third-largest oil
producer, concluded its purchase of a 45 percent stake in
exploration blocks in Brazil’s Amazon, said the chief executive
officer of  HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA. (HRTP3)  HRT pared losses
after the statement.  “It’s closed,” HRT Chief Executive Officer Marcio Mello
told reporters today in Rio de Janeiro. “There’s zero chance”
the deal will fall through.  HRT, which fell 8.3 percent to 650 reais in Sao Paulo
trading, earlier had dropped as much as 15 percent.  TNK-BP agreed to let HRT operate the wells in the Solimoes
Basin of the Amazon, Mello said today at an oil conference in
Rio. The companies will bid together for new exploration blocks
in the region when Brazil offers more areas, Mello said.  TNK-BP bought the stake from Petra Energia SA, HRT’s
original partner in the blocks, through an accord giving HRT the
right to buy Petra’s stake. TNK-BP is seeking opportunities in
Brazil,  Africa , the  Middle East  and  Latin America  to diversify
operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
