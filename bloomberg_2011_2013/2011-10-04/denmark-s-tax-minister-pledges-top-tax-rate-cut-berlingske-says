Denmark’s new Tax Minister, Thor
Moeger Pedersen, pledged to raise the threshold at which the top
marginal tax rate kicks in, according to Berlingske. Pedersen
wants to raise the income threshold by 20,000 kroner ($3,547)
for a combined saving for tax payers currently in that bracket
of 1.7 billion kroner in 2014, the Copenhagen-based newspaper
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
