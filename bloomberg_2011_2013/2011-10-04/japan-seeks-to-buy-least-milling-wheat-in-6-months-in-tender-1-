6, the smallest volume in more than six months, according to the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.  Shipment is set from Dec. 1 to Dec. 31, Masafumi Otsuka at

domestic sales of wheat to stabilize supply, is  Asia ’s largest
buyer as a single entity. It has bought 2.52 million tons
through regular tenders this fiscal year, compared with 5.16
million tons in the year ended March 31.  Details of this week’s tender are listed below:  To contact the reporter on this story:
