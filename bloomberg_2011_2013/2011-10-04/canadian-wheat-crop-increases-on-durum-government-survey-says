Canadian wheat farmers will harvest
4.3 percent more of the grain this year than in 2010, led by
durum, a government survey said.  Farmers will collect 24.16 million metric tons of wheat, up
from last year’s 23.167 million tons,  Statistics Canada  said
today in Ottawa. The durum harvest was pegged at 3.94 million
tons, up 30.2 percent from a year earlier, with the area
harvested jumping 27.5 percent and the expected yield per acre
rising to 36.9 bushels from 36.1 bushels.  Winter wheat output was estimated at 2.98 million tons, up
12.1 percent, and spring wheat output was estimated to fall 1.4
percent to 17.2 million tons, the report said.  Canola production will rise 1.2 percent from last year to
12.93 million tons. The area cultivated by farmers in Canada’s
western provinces rose to a record 17.9 million acres, up 6.3
percent from 2010.  Barley output will increase 3.8 percent to 7.9 million
tons.  The survey of 14,100 farmers was conducted Sept. 1 to Sept.
9, Statistics  Canada  said. Final production estimates will be
published Dec. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
