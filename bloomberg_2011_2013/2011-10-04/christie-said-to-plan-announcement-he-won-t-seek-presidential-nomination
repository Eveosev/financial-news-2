New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie 
will announce that he won’t run for president in 2012, according
to a Republican briefed by members of Christie’s administration.  The person wasn’t authorized to speak for the governor and
declined to be identified. Christie, who has been contemplating
entering the presidential race, has scheduled a 1 p.m. press
conference at the state Capitol in Trenton.  Kevin Roberts , a
spokesman for the governor, declined to say the purpose of the
meeting with reporters.  The 49-year-old Republican has said repeatedly that he
would “have to commit suicide” to convince people he won’t
seek higher office. While on a national round of speeches and
fundraisers for state Republican parties last week, he came
under increasing pressure to change his mind. In recent days, he
has been considering entering the race, said a Republican donor
who asked not to be identified because he isn’t authorized to
speak publicly.  Republican party fundraisers across the country, including
Kenneth Langone, co-founder of  Home Depot Inc. (HD) , have urged
Christie to get into the presidential race.  Christie took office in January 2010 after defeating
incumbent Democrat  Jon Corzine  amid voter dissatisfaction over
the highest property taxes in the U.S. and a sluggish economy.
He cut $10 billion in projected spending on schools, pensions
and towns and required public workers to pay more for health
care, in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
