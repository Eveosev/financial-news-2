Denmark’s new Climate and Energy
Minister Martin Lidegaard expects to have an energy package
ready before the end of the year, Borsen reported. Lidegaard
will base his deal on a proposal put forward by his predecessor,
Lykke Friis, targeting investment of more than 3.6 billion
kroner ($639 million) in new wind turbines and other forms of
renewable energy, the Copenhagen-based newspaper said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
