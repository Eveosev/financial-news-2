The Philippine peso fell to an eight-
month low on concern  Europe ’s worsening debt crisis will
encourage overseas investors to pull out more funds.  The country is seeing a “partial reversal” of capital
inflows, central bank Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo said in a
mobile-phone text message today. The central bank is closely
monitoring “global risk appetite” to ensure that capital flows
are orderly, Governor Amando Tetangco said in an e-mail today.
The government will report September inflation numbers tomorrow,
a week after two typhoons hit the nation.  “Overall, the theme is  risk aversion ,” said Radhika Rao,
an economist at Forecast Pte in  Singapore . “There’s upward
pressure on inflation because of the weaker peso and the series
of storms.”  The currency dropped 0.2 percent to 44.075 per dollar as of
the 4 p.m. close of trading in  Manila , adding to a 1.2 percent
loss in the last three days, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It
earlier touched 44.215, the weakest level since Feb. 1. The peso
slumped 3.3 percent in September, the worst month since May 2010.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its three-month forecast
for the peso to 43 from 42, according to a research report. The
currency will probably end the year around 43 to 43.30 and will
be supported by remittances from overseas Filipinos, Rao said.  Consumer prices rose 4.9 percent last month from a year
earlier, compared with a 4.7 percent increase in August,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Government bonds  fell ahead of the inflation report. The
yield on the 6.5 percent April 2021 notes rose 11 basis points,
or 0.11 percentage point, to 6.32 percent, based on midday
fixing prices at Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp.  The  Philippines  plans to sell 10- and 15-year bonds to
individuals this month, Deputy Treasurer Eduardo Mendiola said
yesterday. The government hired 10 banks to manage the offering,
and pricing may take place on Oct. 10, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
