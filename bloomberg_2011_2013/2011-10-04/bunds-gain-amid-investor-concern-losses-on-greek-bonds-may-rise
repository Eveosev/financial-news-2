German 10-year bunds climbed for the
fourth consecutive day as investors sought the safest assets
after European governments signaled bondholders may need to take
bigger losses on Greek debt in a second aid package.  German two-year notes, perceived to be among  Europe ’s
safest debt securities, also rose as European and Asian stocks
slid. European producer-price inflation weakened in August,
adding to evidence growth is faltering. Greek bonds slid, while
Italian bonds advanced as the  European Central Bank  was said to
purchase the securities. Austria sold 1.1 billion euros ($1.45
billion) of 2015 and 2037 debt and Belgium auctioned bills.  “We have no clear signs of a solution to the debt
crisis,” said Ralf Umlauf, head of floor research at Helaba
Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen in  Frankfurt . “Renewed fear of an
escalation of the debt crisis is supporting bunds.”  The 10-year bund yield fell nine basis points to 1.72
percent at 4.31 p.m. in  London . It reached a record low 1.636
percent on Sept. 23. The 2.25 percent security due September
2021 jumped 0.86 or 8.6 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to
104.77. Two-year yields dropped five basis points to 0.45
percent.  Factory-gate prices in the 17-nation euro region rose 5.9
percent in August from a year earlier after a 6.1 percent
increase in July, the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg said today. Economists had projected a gain of 5.8
percent, according to the median of 19 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey.  ‘Technical Revisions’  European finance ministers considered reshaping a July deal
that foresaw investors contributing 50 billion euros to a 159
billion-euro rescue. That private sector involvement, or PSI,
includes debt exchanges and rollovers.  “As far as PSI is concerned, we have to take into account
that we have experienced changes since the decision we have
taken on July 21,” Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  told reporters today after chairing a meeting of euro-
area finance chiefs in Luxembourg. “These are technical
revisions we are discussing.”  The ministers also pushed back a decision on the release of
Greece’s next 8 billion-euro loan installment until after Oct.
13. It was the second postponement of a vote originally slated
for yesterday as part of the 110 billion-euro lifeline granted
to Greece last year.  ‘Contagion’ Concern  “The key thing here is whether you do it for Greece only
or whether there is contagion and people start to price in these
moves for other countries,” said  Laurent Fransolet , head of
European fixed-income strategy at  Barclays Capital  in London.
“Everybody can just about take a higher haircut on  Greece ,
except maybe the Greek banks, but if you have that sort of
contagion towards the other countries then it makes it much more
difficult.”  Fransolet spoke in an interview with  Owen Thomas  on
Bloomberg Television’s “Countdown.”  Greek two-year securities dropped, with the yield climbing
246 basis points to 64.73 percent. The 10-year yield jumped 49
basis points to 23.11 percent, driving the difference in yield
with benchmark bunds 57 basis points higher to 21.38 percentage
points, or 2,138 basis points.  Bailouts for Greece, Ireland and  Portugal , and bond
purchases by the ECB haven’t kept the debt crisis from
threatening to engulf Italy and  Spain . Policy makers began
buying Spanish and Italian securities on Aug. 8 to curb a surge
in yields, according to traders who deal with the central bank.  ECB Buying  The Frankfurt-based central bank bought Italian debt today,
according to four people with knowledge of the transactions, who
asked not to be identified because the trades are confidential.
A spokeswoman for the ECB declined to comment.  Italian bonds rose, pushing the 10-year yield four basis
points lower to 5.50 percent. The two-year note yield was little
changed at 4.22 percent, with similar-maturity Spanish note
yields at 3.48 percent.  Belgian two-year notes snapped a nine-day advance as
Finance Minister  Didier Reynders  said that  France  and  Belgium 
are ready to provide guarantees for the financing of Dexia SA
after shares of the municipal lender plunged the most since its
creation. Belgium’s biggest bank has struggled to obtain short-
term funding as investors grew concerned it would have to write
down the value of its sovereign-debt holdings.  Credit-Default Swaps  Volatility on Belgian sovereign debt was the highest among
euro-area markets today, according to measures of 10-year bonds,
two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps. The
yield change in the nation’s 10-year securities was 4.7 times
the 90-day average, a Bloomberg gauge showed. The two-year yield
rose 27 basis points to 2.08 percent, after dropping 60 basis
points since Sept. 20.  Belgium, which has been without a full-time government for
almost 16 months, today sold about 3.5 billion euros of 105- and
161-day bills.  Credit-default swaps on  Germany  rose four basis points to
an all-time high of 122 and France increased nine to 199,
approaching the record closing price of 202.5 on Sept. 22,
according to CMA. French and German banks have the biggest
holdings of Greek debt, according to the Basel, Switzerland-
based  Bank for International Settlements .  Austrian bonds rose as the nation issued debt, pushing the
yield on the 10-year security down three basis points to 2.62
percent. The yield difference, or spread, between Austrian 10-
year securities and similar-maturity German bunds widened to 88
basis points, the most since April 2009.  ‘Easily Absorbed’  Austria  issued 440 million euros of its bond maturing March
2037 at an average yield of 3.172 percent in an auction today.
It last tapped the 2037 bond on Sept. 6, when it issued 660
million euros at 3.447 percent. The AAA rated nation also issued
660 million euros of its bond maturing July 2015 at an average
yield of 1.502 percent. It last sold the bond on March 1, when
it issued 660 million euros at 2.514 percent.  “Austrian bonds have been easily absorbed,” said Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income strategist at Newedge Group SA in London,
wrote in a note to investors. “The relative amount on offer and
solid fiscal position for Austria supported today’s auction.”  German  government bonds  returned 7.9 percent in the third
quarter, leaving them with an 8.2 percent gain in 2011,
according to indexes compiled by the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. Greek bonds tumbled
36 percent this year, with Italian debt losing 2.7 percent, the
indexes showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
