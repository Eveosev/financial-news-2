Hungarian savings cooperatives are
offering forint loans to borrowers wishing to repay foreign-
currency mortgages at below-market rates, as they seek to regain
market share from commercial banks.  The savings cooperatives, which have about 600 billion
forint ($2.7 billion) to lend, are offering loans to households
at a total cost of 10 percent to 11 percent, in an attempt to
increase their market share from the current 20 percent, the
National Association of Savings Cooperatives said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Hungarian lawmakers approved legislation on Sept. 19 that
allows early repayment of Swiss-franc denominated mortgages,
which account for most of the loans, at a fixed exchange rate of
180 forint per franc; euro-denominated mortgages can be repaid
at 250 forint per euro, provided the loans were taken out at
lower exchange rates. Losses will be assumed by banks.  Many people will need new loans to pay back existing
foreign-currency loans. Consequently, the largest commercial
lenders have tightened up on lending and raised  interest rates 
on loans in a bid to dissuade borrowers from early repayment,
news portal  Origo.hu  said, citing its own survey.  The central bank estimates that 20 percent of a total of 18
billion euros ($24 billion) of foreign-currency mortgages will
be repaid at fixed exchange rates below market levels as part of
the government plan, Governor Andras Simor said on Sept. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
