European governments are divided over
whether to grant a banking license to the European Financial
Stability Facility so it can leverage up its 440 billion-euro
firepower, Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said.  “There is no consensus on this right now,” Fekter told
reporters after a meeting of European finance ministers in
 Luxembourg  today. “Some countries are in favor, others are
against.”  Fekter also said she opposes “large scale” bond buying by
the EFSF. “I don’t want the facility to become a bad bank,”
she said.  A collateral model negotiated by Finland will be discussed
by the Vienna government, but it is “not so much attractive”
for  Austria , she added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
