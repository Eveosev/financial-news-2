The  Czech Republic ’s PX stock index
snapped a three-day decline, rising 0.9 percent to 899.4 at its
4:28 p.m. close in Prague.  The following were among the most active equities in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  AAA Auto Group NV (AAA)   rose 3.5 percent to 18 koruna,
ending three days of losses. The Czech used-car dealer said
today Chief Executive Officer Anthony Denny bought 17,875 shares
of the company this week.  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)   of  Austria  jumped 5.7 percent
to 445.2 koruna after losing 17 percent in the previous four
sessions. European shares rose amid speculation policy makers
are examining measures to shield banks from the region’s
government-debt crisis.  New World Resources Plc (NWR CP), the biggest coking-coal
producer in the Czech Republic, increased 1.3 percent to 123.5
koruna, after earlier rising as much as 6.6 percent. The stock
lost 13 percent in the previous four sessions, pushing the 14-
day relative strength index to 29 at yesterday’s close. Readings
lower than thirty suggest to technical analysts a security or an
index may increase. The RSI rose to 31 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
