Repsol YPF SA (REP) ’s Canaport liquefied-
natural-gas terminal in  Canada  is to receive a cargo of the fuel
Oct. 6, according to ship tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  The vessel Madrid Spirit can carry as much as 135,423 cubic
meters of LNG, or about 2.92 billion cubic feet. It’s bound for
Canada after leaving Trinidad and Tobago, the data show.  Canaport, located in Saint John,  New Brunswick , can put as
much as 1.2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas into
regional pipelines, according to  the company . Repsol, Spain’s
largest oil producer, owns 75 percent of the terminal. Saint
John-based Irving Oil Corp. owns 25 percent. Repsol has
contracted for 100 percent of the capacity.  LNG is gas that is cooled to a liquid for transport by ship
to markets not connected by pipelines. The fuel is received at
import terminals and converted back to a gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
