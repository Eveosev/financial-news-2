German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
rejected the option of a Greek default, saying that it would
have incalculable consequences.  Merkel said that she can’t listen to economists who urge a
GReek default now. Speaking today to members of her  Christian
Democratic Union  in Magdeburg, eastern  Germany , Merkel said that
she won’t risk embarking on an “adventure” to solve the debt
crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
