Baron de Ley (BDL)  SA, the maker of  Spain ’s
best-selling Rioja wine, will miss its full-year revenue target
as the country’s economic crisis forces Spanish consumers to
drink less and purchase cheaper vintages.  Sales this year will decline 4 percent to 4.5 percent from
2010, compared with a previous forecast of unchanged revenue,
Eduardo Santos-Ruiz Diaz, chairman and chief executive officer
of the Navarre, Spain-based company, said by telephone today.  “This is a very difficult year for the domestic market,”
Santos-Ruiz, 66, said in an interview. “The expectations remain
bad. Christmas is expected to be sad as companies won’t give
gifts away. We forecast the last quarter to be a tough one.”  The company’s shares sank 5.1 percent to 40.80 euros at the
5:30 p.m. close in Madrid, after gaining as much as 2.1 percent
earlier in the day. The stock has dropped 9.3 percent this year,
valuing the company at 210.4 million euros ($279.2 million).  The winemaker, whose 2010 revenue rose 2.2 percent to
85.9 million euros, expects domestic sales this year to fall
about 13 percent, the CEO said. Spanish consumption is declining
as the country suffers from the euro zone’s highest unemployment
rate of 21 percent. Baron de Ley plans to compensate with an
increase in exports, especially to the U.K.,  Germany  and the
 Nordic countries , of about 8 percent.  Falling prices for grapes are boosting margins, Santos-Ruiz
said. The company may post growth of about 2 percent in both
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
and net income compared with 2010, he said. Net income in 2010
increased 14 percent to 17.6 million euros.  The outlook for next year is challenging and the situation
may only start to change in two years, the CEO said.  “2012 will be similar to this year and hopefully when we
reach the bottom,” Santos-Ruiz said from his office in Madrid.
“Growth won’t come in 2012, but in 2013.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
