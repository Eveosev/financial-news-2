Lenders increased overnight deposits
at the  European Central Bank  to the highest in more than a year
as the euro-region’s debt crisis intensifies.  Banks parked 209 billion euros ($276 billion) at the
Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday, up from 199.6 billion euros Sept.
30. That’s the most since July 2010 and compares with a year-to-
date average of 54 billion euros.  “It’s a reflection that there seems to be limited lending
within the money market,” said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income
strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in
London. “There is less willingness to lend between banks and
more willingness to lend to the ECB so banks at least get
something for their money.”  European finance ministers are considering revising a July
deal for a second Greek bailout, fueling concern bondholders may
have to take bigger losses on the nation’s debt. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. cut its global growth forecasts and predicted
recessions in Germany and  France , while  Standard & Poor’s  said
 Europe  faces an increased risk of a double-dip recession.  “Peaks in deposits have generally been at times of extreme
stress,” Green said. “There are many variables and we don’t
know where things are going to go. It’s all part of the huge
uncertainty in Europe at the moment.”  Euribor-OIS  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
Europe rose. The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
euro interbank offered rate and overnight index swaps, was
little changed at 80 basis points as of 4:37 p.m. in London,
compared with 89 on Sept. 23, the widest since March 2009.  The three-month cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks
pay to convert euro payments into dollars, fell to 107 basis
points below Euribor from 109 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The cost was 112.5 basis points under
Euribor on Sept. 12, when the swap was the most expensive since
December 2008. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The one-year cross-currency basis swap was little changed
at 73 basis points under Euribor.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, was little
changed at 38 basis points.  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros -- was unchanged from 1.557 percent
yesterday. One-week Euribor fell to 1.184 percent from 1.197
percent.  The three-month dollar  London  interbank offered rate, or
Libor, rose for an 18th day to 0.381 percent from 0.378 percent,
according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s the
highest since Aug. 11, 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
