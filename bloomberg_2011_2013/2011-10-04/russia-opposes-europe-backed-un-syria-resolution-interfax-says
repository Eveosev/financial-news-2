Russia  won’t support the latest
European draft of the  United Nations  resolution on  Syria ,
Interfax reported, citing Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady
Gatilov.  The proposed resolution is “unacceptable” because it
contains the prospect of sanctions and amounts to interference
in the internal affairs of the Middle Eastern state, Gatilov was
cited as saying by the news service.  European nations on the UN Security Council on Sept. 29
circulated a fourth version of their draft resolution on Syria
in a continuing bid to win Russia’s support. It deletes the word
“sanctions,” instead threatening to adopt “targeted
measures” in the event that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s
government doesn’t halt attacks on protesters.  Russia is one five veto-wielding members of the  Security
Council  and abstained in a March vote authorizing a western-led
military campaign in Libya. Gatilov didn’t specify whether
Russia is prepared to veto the resolution on Syria.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich declined
to comment on the proposed document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
