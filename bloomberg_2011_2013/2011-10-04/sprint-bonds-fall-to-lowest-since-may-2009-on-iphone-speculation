Bonds from  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) 
plunged to the lowest level in more than two years on
speculation that an agreement to sell  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone will
curtail profits.  The third-largest U.S. wireless operator’s $2 billion of
8.75 percent senior unsecured notes due in March 2032 fell 3.5
cents to 79 cents on the dollar as of 12:31 p.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. That’s the lowest since
the bonds traded at the same level in May 2009.  To win the right to sell the iPhone, Sprint had to commit
to buy at least 30.5 million of the devices from Apple over four
years, which would cost $20 billion at current rates, the Wall
Street Journal reported yesterday.  Verizon Wireless  and AT&T Inc., the two biggest wireless
carriers, are both able to sell the iPhone. Sprint is based in
Overland Park, Kansas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
