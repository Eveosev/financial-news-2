Credit-default swaps insuring bank
debt surged after European lawmakers signaled lenders may have
to take bigger losses on holdings of Greek debt.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of swaps on the senior
debt of 25 banks and insurers jumped 16.5 basis points to 305.5
and the subordinated index climbed 25 to a record 567, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 1:30 p.m. in  London . An increase
signals deteriorating perceptions of  credit quality .  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  signaled
finance ministers are considering reshaping a July deal that
foresaw investors contributing 50 billion euros ($66 billion) to
a 159 billion-euro Greek rescue with debt exchanges and
rollovers. The leaders are struggling to prevent the crisis
engulfing the rest of the region.  “It is going to be challenging to persuade the banks to
take a bigger hit at this stage when they are already under such
pressure,” said  Gary Jenkins , head of fixed income at Evolution
Securities Ltd. in London. “Any larger Greek write off will no
doubt encourage investors to revisit valuations for the likes of
 Portugal , Italy etc. which in turn will put the banks under more
pressure.”  Credit-default swaps on  Germany  rose four basis points to
an all-time high of 122 and France increased nine to 199,
approaching the record closing price of 202.5 on Sept. 22,
according to CMA. French and German banks have the biggest
holdings of Greek debt, according to the Basel, Switzerland-
based Bank for International Settlements.  Deutsche Bank  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  swaps jumped 19 basis points to 210 after
saying the planned operating pretax profit target of 10 billion
euros from its core businesses for 2011 is no longer achievable.  Swaps on France’s three biggest banks also rose, with
 Societe Generale (GLE)  SA up 26 basis points at 378,  Credit Agricole
SA (ACA)  19 higher at 282 and  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA up 18 to 281, according
to CMA.  “Currently the tensions are such that we could see forced
sellers, with some banks needing to de-risk sharply,” said
Alberto Gallo, head of European credit strategy at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc in London. “There’s a lot of counterparty
hedging activity in CDS, which goes back to the fact that in
Europe, banks own bank bonds.”  Swaps on Belgium jumped 22 basis points to 293.5, Italy
rose nine to 480 and Portugal climbed 24 to 1,134, while Spain
was seven higher at 387, all nearing records set last month.
Ireland rose 21 basis points to 717, CMA prices show.  It costs $6.14 million in advance and $100,000 annually to
insure $10 million of Greek debt for five years. That signals a
greater than 90 percent probability of default, assuming
investors would recover 32 percent of their holdings, according
to CMA.  Sovereign Swaps  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western  Europe  Index of swaps on 15
governments rose 11 basis points to 353.  The cost of insuring corporate debt also increased. The
Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-
grade ratings jumping as much as nine basis points to 215.5,
surpassing the December 2008 record closing price of 215, before
trading at 215, JPMorgan prices show.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 34.5
basis points to 892.5, the highest since April 2009.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
