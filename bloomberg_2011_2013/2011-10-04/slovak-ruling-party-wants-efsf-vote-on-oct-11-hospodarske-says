Slovakia’s  Christian Democrats , a
member of the ruling coalition, want the country to hold a
parliamentary vote on the bailout-fund overhaul as early as Oct.
11,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing a party official.  Should parliament reject the changes to the European
Financial Stability Facility in the first vote, the ruling
coalition would have time to hold a second vote by the Oct. 14
deadline after negotiating with the opposition, the newspaper
cited Pavol Abrhan, a member of the Christian Democrats’
leadership, as saying.  The four coalition partners meet today to discuss the vote
as one of the governing parties, Freedom and Solidarity,
continues to reject the package, Hospodarske said. Sme, the
largest opposition party, has said it will support the bailout
legislation only if early elections are called, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
