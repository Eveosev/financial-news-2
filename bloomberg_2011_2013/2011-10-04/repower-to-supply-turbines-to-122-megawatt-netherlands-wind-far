Repower Systems SE, a German wind
turbine maker, won an order to supply its machines to a 122-
megawatt wind farm in the Netherlands owned by Swedish utility
Vattenfall AB.  Hamburg-based Repower, a unit of  Asia ’s third-largest
turbine maker Suzlon Energy Ltd. of  India , signed a contract for
the supply of 36 turbines with 3.4 megawatts of capacity each
with Zuidlob Wind, a Vattenfall unit, Repower said today in a
website  statement . Financial details weren’t disclosed.  The wind farm near Zeewolde, to be completed in the spring
of 2013, is “one of the country’s largest,” Andreas Nauen,
chief executive officer at Repower, said in the statement.  Construction of the project will start later this year,
according to Vattenfall’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
