Two-thirds of municipal-finance
professionals expect the number of state and local defaults will
stay the same or drop compared with last year, according to a
survey conducted by  RBC Capital Markets .  Of 116 bankers and government officials questioned, 64
percent said they expected the number of defaults would stay the
same or drop, up from 63 percent in February. Those who thought
there would be fewer defaults jumped to 35 percent in September
from 11 percent in February.  “The RBC survey shows that there has been a recent
positive shift in the way people view the state of the municipal
industry,” said Chris Hamel, head of U.S. municipal finance for
Toronto-based RBC Capital Markets.  The survey was conducted at the Bond Buyer’s California
Public Finance Conference Sept. 14-16.  Municipal defaults have dropped this year to about $1.1
billion, a quarter of last year’s total, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch.  Meredith Whitney , the banking analyst who
correctly predicted Citigroup Inc.’s dividend cut in 2008, told
the CBS “60 Minutes” show in December that the next 12 months
would see “hundreds of billions of dollars” of defaults.  To contact the reporter on this story:
