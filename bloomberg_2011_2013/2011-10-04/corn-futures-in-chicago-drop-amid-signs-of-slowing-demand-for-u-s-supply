Corn and wheat fell in  Chicago  as
supply concerns eased amid signs of increased stockpiles and
slowing demand for exports from the U.S., the world’s largest
shipper of both grains. Soybeans dropped.  Corn stockpiles in the U.S., the largest grower, totaled
1.28 billion bushels on Sept. 1, 20 percent more than estimated
by analysts, the Department of Agriculture said in a report
Sept. 30. The USDA said 2.15 billion bushels of wheat were in
storage, beating analysts’ estimates of 2.07 billion. Corn and
wheat both fell 23 percent in September.  “There’s only one big fundamental in the room, and it’s
the lingering fears from the Sept. 30 report,” said Christopher Gadd, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in  London . “People are
factoring that into the market.”  Corn for December delivery declined 9 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $5.835 a bushel by 12:07 p.m. London time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The grain is down 6.9 percent this year.  Corn inspected for export at U.S. ports fell 18 percent to
28.4 million bushels in the week to Sept. 29, from a week
earlier, the USDA said yesterday. The nation’s crop was about 21
percent harvested as of Oct. 2, behind the five-year average of
23 percent, the agency said.  Rain may fall in parts of  Kansas ,  Oklahoma  and  Texas , the
biggest U.S. producers of winter wheat, aiding establishment of
recently planted crops and encouraging seeding, Joel Widenor,
director of agriculture services at Commodity Weather Group LLC
in Bethesda,  Maryland , said in a report today.  “A weekend rain event is likely to bring significant
relief to about two-thirds of the belt, with far western areas
at most risk to see lingering dryness concerns and areas from
central  Nebraska  through central Texas having the best chance
for substantial rain,” Widenor said.  Wheat Falls  Wheat for December delivery dropped 8.5 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $6.11 a bushel in Chicago. USDA export inspections
for the grain rose the least since May in the latest week,
figures compiled by Bloomberg show.  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris fell 2.50 euros, or 1.3 percent, to 182.75 euros ($242.12)
a metric ton.  Soybeans for November delivery lost 8.25 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $11.6925 a bushel in Chicago, on track for a third
straight decline.  To contact the reporters on this story:
