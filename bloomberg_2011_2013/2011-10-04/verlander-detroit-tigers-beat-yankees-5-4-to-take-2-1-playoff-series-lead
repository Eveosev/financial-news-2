Justin Verlander struck out 11 in
eight strong innings to give the Detroit Tigers a 5-4 win
against the New York Yankees tonight and a two-games-to-one lead
in their American League Division Series.  Verlander, who led  Major League Baseball  with 24 wins this
season, scattered six hits at Comerica Park as Detroit won its
second straight game in the best-of-five series.  Detroitâ€™s Delmon Young broke a 4-4 tie in the seventh
inning with a solo home run off reliever Rafael Soriano. Game 4
is tomorrow night in Detroit.  In the other AL Division Series, the  Texas Rangers  defeated
the Tampa Bay Rays 4-3 earlier tonight to take a 2-1 lead.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
