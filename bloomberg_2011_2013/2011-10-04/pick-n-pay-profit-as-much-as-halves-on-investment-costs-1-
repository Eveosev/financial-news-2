Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. (PIK) ,  South
Africa ’s second-largest grocer, said fiscal first-half profit as
much as halved after introducing a  loyalty program  and investing
in its distribution system.  Earnings per share in the six months through August dropped
between 40 percent and 50 percent, the Cape Town-based company
said in a stock-exchange statement today. Sales increased 7.4
percent amid “tough economic conditions, dominated by low
inflation and a highly competitive trading environment.”  The sale of its Franklins supermarket chain in  Australia  to
Metcash Ltd. was completed on Sept. 30, earning Pick n Pay about
1.3 billion rand ($157 million). Proceeds from the sale, which
the company will reinvest in its South African operations, will
be accounted for in the fiscal second-half, Pick n Pay said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
