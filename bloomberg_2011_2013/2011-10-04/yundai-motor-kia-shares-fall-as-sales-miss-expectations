Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) 
slumped in Seoul trading after sales in the U.S. missed
consensus expectations and concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is
deepening dragged down South Korean stocks.  Hyundai fell 4.7 percent to 201,000 won at 9:57 a.m. on the
Korea Exchange, its biggest decline in more than a week, and Kia
dropped 4.3 percent to 68,800 won. The benchmark Kospi Index
fell 5.7 percent.  The Seoul-based automakers sold a combined 87,660 vehicles
in the U.S. in September, below the 20 percent gain that was the
average of three estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales were 14
percent higher than a year ago.  Hyundai, South Korea’s largest automaker, sold 52,051
vehicles, up 12 percent from a year earlier. Kia, a Hyundai
affiliate, sold 35,609 vehicles, up from 30,071 year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
