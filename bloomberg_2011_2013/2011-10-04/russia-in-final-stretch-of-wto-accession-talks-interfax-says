Russia  is in the “final stretch” of
its talks to join the  World Trade Organization  and may complete
the accession process in December, Interfax reported, citing
Deputy Economy Minister Andrei Slepnyov.  The country has “in general” reached an agreement on
lowering meat import quotas with “key players” and has
resolved disagreements on industrial-assembly rules with the
U.S., Slepnyov was cited as saying by the news service, adding
that a “number of technical” questions remain to be negotiated
with European countries.  Russia, the largest economy outside the world trade
arbiter, has been trying to join the organization since 1993,
surpassing the 15 years  China  had to wait before becoming a
member. Georgia, which fought a five-day war with Russia in 2008
and has so far blocked its accession, will continue negotiations
with Russia in Geneva on Oct. 7, Deputy Foreign Minister Davit
Jalagania told reporters yesterday.  U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk, who met Russian First
Deputy Prime Minister  Igor Shuvalov  in  Washington  yesterday,
said the country’s membership talks “have entered a final
phase” after it “made great progress on its accession bid,”
according to a  statement  released after the meeting.  Kirk “expressed confidence that remaining issues,
including satisfactory resolution of bilateral discussions
between Russia and Georgia, would be addressed constructively
and in a manner enabling Russia to meet its objective of
concluding the WTO negotiations by the end of the year,”
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
