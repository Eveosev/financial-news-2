Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas said
the countries sharing Europe’s common currency are a “union of
debt” as he reiterated the country has no target date for
adopting the euro.  The  Czech Republic  fully supports Bulgaria’s ambition to
join the Schengen Area and opposition from some countries is
“unfair,” Necas said today at a press conference in Prague
with Boyko Borisov, his counterpart from the Balkan state.  Czech utility  CEZ AS (CEZ)  faces a number of problems operating
in Bulgaria, Necas said. Borisov replied at the press conference
that the country is working on solving those issues for the
state-run CEZ.  To contact the reporter on this story:
