Money-losing forced sales of Dutch
homes with mortgages backed by the Homeownership Guarantee Fund
climbed 20 percent in the third quarter.  The government-backed fund received 458 requests for
compensation compared with 381 applications a year earlier, the
manager of the fund, National Mortgage Guarantee, or NHG, said
on its  website  today. The average payout rose 10 percent, mainly
because of declining  house prices .  Dutch house prices dropped the most in 14 months in August
as rising interest rates, lending restrictions and  Europe â€™s debt
crisis discouraged buyers. Rabobank, the biggest Dutch mortgage
lender, expects prices to fall 2 percent this year and 2.5
percent next year, after slipping 2 percent in 2010 and 3.3
percent in 2009.  The fund will compensate 42 million euros ($55 million) of
losses through the third quarter, up from 30.1 million euros a
year earlier. Zoetermeer, Netherlands-based NHG rejected 74
applications in the quarter compared with 30 a year earlier and
expects to compensate 2,000 losses this year, almost half due to
divorces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
