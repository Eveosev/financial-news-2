The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
closed under 1,100 for the first time in more than a year,
falling below the  price range  that held since August and putting
the gauge within 1 percent of a bear market.  Declines of at least 3 percent yesterday in banks, energy
producers, drugmakers and industrial companies helped push the
benchmark gauge down 32.19 points to 1,099.23, bringing its two-
day retreat to 5.3 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The index would complete a 20 percent decline from
its April 29 high by closing below 1,090.88. It slipped as low
as 1,074.77 today before surging to 1,123.95.  Concern governments may be running out of tools to keep the
global economic slowdown from worsening has left equities from
 Brazil  to  Hong Kong  and Frankfurt in bear markets.  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  lost 9.6 percent yesterday and has decreased 59
percent in 2011. The declines are confounding bullish investors
who speculated the recovery that began in March 2009 would boost
stocks for a third year.  “Obviously I’ve been too optimistic,” said  Byron Wien ,
the vice chairman of Blackstone Advisory Partners LP, whose
parent, New York-based Blackstone Group LP, is the world’s
biggest private-equity firm. Wien said the S&P 500 would climb
more than 19 percent in 2011 to above 1,500 in predictions
published Jan. 3. While the former Morgan Stanley strategist
says shares may fall into a bear market, he said gains are
possible by year end.  Losing Support  The S&P 500 slid 2.9 percent yesterday, surpassing the 2011
low of 1,119.46 set on Aug. 8. The gauge had slipped within 1
percent of the level on three separate occasions in the last two
months, before rallying an average of 6.7 percent. None of the
advances surpassed 1,260.34, the closing price on Aug. 3, two
days before S&P stripped the U.S. of its AAA credit rating.  Companies in the benchmark gauge for American equities
trade at 9.9 times 2012 forecast earnings, compared with the
average in economic contractions since 1957 of 13.7, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. At the same time, analysts have
cut projections for profits next year by 2.6 percent to $110.76
a share, the biggest eight-week drop since 2009, the data show.  Gross domestic product in the U.S. may expand by 2.2
percent in 2012 and 2.5 percent in 2013, according to the median
forecast in a survey of 66 economists conducted by Bloomberg.
The estimate for next year is down from as high as 3.3 percent
in March.  Avoiding Recessions  “We can avoid a recession,” said Wien, whose prediction
in January that oil would reach $115 a barrel proved correct.
“If the stock market acts badly enough, that can destroy
 consumer confidence , which is already in tenuous shape, and that
can produce a recession.”  Financial stocks fell 4.5 percent yesterday, the most in
the S&P 500, bringing the retreat for 2011 to 29 percent. Mining
companies and energy producers both fell into bear markets on
Aug. 8 as the S&P GSCI Total Return Index of commodities slid 23
percent from its April 8 high.  “The U.S. equity market has a massive divergence of
performance”  Michael Shaoul , chairman of Marketfield Asset
Management in New York, said in a telephone interview yesterday.
Computer makers have decreased 14 percent and consumer
discretionary stocks fell 16 percent since the S&P 500 reached a
three-year high in April, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  ‘More Nuanced’  “That’s why even if the  S&P 500  ends up down 22 or 23 or
25 percent, you’d want to be a little bit more nuanced,” said
Shaoul, who oversees $1 billion and said the S&P 500 is unlikely
to fall to 1,022.58, its low in July 2010. “This is quite a
different correction to that which we saw last summer. This
time, the market has been picky about what is being punished.”  About $10 trillion was wiped from global equity markets in
the third quarter. Benchmark measures for 37 out of 45 nations
in the MSCI All-Country World Index posted declines of 20
percent or more from their peaks, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Besides the U.S., only two other developed markets --
the U.K. and  New Zealand  -- haven’t dropped 20 percent or more
from their most-recent highs.  Stocks are undervalued and investors are ignoring stronger-
than-forecast corporate and economic data and overestimating the
risk of another U.S. recession, according to  Philip Orlando , the
New York-based chief equity market strategist at Federated
Investors Inc. He said on July 5 that equity prices already
reflected the effect of a slowdown in GDP growth.  Only  Europe   Investors shunned riskier countries’ bonds yesterday amid
concern that the region’s crisis is careening out of control.
Europe’s financial leaders are fighting on multiple fronts,
trying to repair  Greece ’s economy while insulating Italy and
Spain and shoring up banks that the  International Monetary Fund 
says face as much as 300 billion euros in credit risks.  “All the market cares about right now is Europe,”
Orlando, who helps oversee about $350 billion, said in a
telephone interview yesterday. “Every investment decision is
being made through the prism of Europe and the expectation that
Greece is going to default and drag the rest of the world into a
recession. We don’t believe that. We believe that the  U.S.
economy  is extricating itself from the soft patch.”  Dexia SA, Belgium’s biggest bank by assets, said its board
asked Chief Executive Officer Pierre Mariani to take steps to
fix the company’s “structural problems” after Europe’s
sovereign debt crisis worsened. The board met yesterday to
discuss a possible breakup of the company after the debt crisis
reduced its ability to obtain funding, three people with
knowledge of the talks said.  Net Longs  Political impasse in Europe and the threat of a recession
spurred  Barton Biggs  to cut bets that stocks will gain to 20
percent in his hedge fund, down from as much as 85 percent six
months ago, the founder of Traxis Partners LP said on Sept. 22.  “I wish I was zero,” Biggs said on Bloomberg Television’s
“Street Smart” with  Matt Miller  and  Carol Massar . Markets are
telling policy makers that “they’ve got to change and act or
we’re going to go into a double-dip recession, and we’re going
to go down another 20 percent,” he said.  Bank of America in Charlotte,  North Carolina , slid 59 cents
to $5.53 yesterday, the lowest price since March 2009. Banks
have retreated as European regulators attempt to quell concern
that their lenders may be hurt by the sovereign debt crisis.  The S&P 500 tumbled 14 percent in the third quarter, the
worst drop since the three months ending December 2008. The
Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 17 percent in the third quarter.  21% of Revenue  Europe accounts for 21 percent of the S&P 500’s revenue,
down from 23 percent in 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg from 185 companies that disclose results for the
region. The impact on the U.S. financial sector is greater,
according to Daniel Genter, who oversees about $3.7 billion as
president of RNC Genter Capital Management in  Los Angeles .  “Frankly, you just can’t get a handle on it,” Genter said
in a phone interview yesterday. “You can’t really tell the
impact it’s going to have. We look at it from a gross numbers
standpoint and say, ‘This doesn’t take us to another financial
crisis in the U.S.’ But honestly, I can’t sit here and
quantitatively tell you why not.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
