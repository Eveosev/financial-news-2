French President Nicolas Sarkozy
would lose the first round of next year’s presidential election
to his two main  Socialist Party  contenders, an Ipsos institute
poll suggested.  Sarkozy, who has yet to declare for the presidential race,
would take 21 percent at the April 2012 ballot compared with 32
percent for  Francois Hollande  as the leading Socialist
candidate, according to the poll for Radio  France  and tomorrow’s
 Le Monde  newspaper. Against  Martine Aubry , Sarkozy would lose 22
percent to 29 percent.  Sarkozy would beat Segolene Royal, the Socialist Party’s
candidate at the 2007 election, by 23 percent to 22 percent.
Marine Le Pen, the National Front candidate, would take 16
percent in each of the three scenarios, the poll showed.  France will hold the first round of the presidential
elections on April 22 and the second and final round on May 6.
The Socialist Party will nominate its candidate over two ballot
rounds on Oct. 9 and Oct. 16.  Paris-based Ipsos conducted the poll of 962 voters on Sept.
30 and Oct. 1. It didn’t provide a margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
