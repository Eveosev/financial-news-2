(Corrects description in second paragraph of origins of
Fibonacci numbers.)  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
fall another 6.9 percent to as low as 1,020 within the next 12
months, according to analysts who use the Fibonacci system to
forecast stock prices.  The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities closed below 1,101.15
yesterday, having lost 38.2 percent of its gain since the
beginning of the  bull market  in March 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Some traders who use Fibonacci numbers,
which were highlighted in the 13th century by mathematician
Leonardo of Pisa, believe a decline to the 50 percent level is
likely once 38.2 percent is reached.  “The big question now is: do we make this retracement now,
or sometime next year?” Dan Wantrobski, the Philadelphia-based
director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC,
wrote in a note today. “It is of course tough to say right now,
but with the breaking of the 38.2 percent retracement on the
S&P, it would appear that getting there sooner is a distinct
possibility.”  Concern that the European debt crisis will drive the global
economy into another recession pushed the  S&P 500  down 14
percent in the third quarter, the worst performance since 2008.
The index would complete a 20 percent decline from its April 29
high, the threshold for a  bear market , by closing below 1,090.88
today.  The S&P 500 slipped 3.65 points, or 0.3 percent, to
1,095.58 at 1:19 p.m. in New York.  The midpoint of the S&P 500’s rally from a 12-year low in
March 2009 through its 2011 peak, at 1,020.07, is 0.2 percent
below last year’s low of 1,022.58, according to Bloomberg data.
 John Murphy , chief technical analyst at StockCharts.com, said he
views that level as the “next major downside target” for the
benchmark.  “What the S&P 500 does when it gets there will obviously
be very important,” Murphy wrote in a note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
