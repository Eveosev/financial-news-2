Japan  may rely on the U.S. for 20
percent of its liquefied petroleum gas imports in 2018, up from
3.5 percent last year, according to an industry group.  Japan plans to buy about 3 million metric tons of the fuel
from the U.S. in 2018, Tatsuhiko Yamasaki, the chairman of the
 Japan LP Gas Association , told reporters in Tokyo today. The
country depended on the Middle East for 85 percent of its 13.2
million tons of purchases last year, according to a report from
the group that represents 14 members.  Japanese companies including Astomos Energy Corp. are
boosting LPG imports from the U.S. to take advantage of a surge
in North American shale-gas production. Overseas shipments meet
about 70 percent of Japan’s requirement, with the remainder
covered by domestic oil refining. LPG supply from the U.S. more
than doubled in the first half of this year to 390,000 tons,
data from the Finance Ministry in  Tokyo  show.  Japan can improve its bargaining power and reduce fuel
costs by diversifying its sources of LPG supply, according to
Yamasaki, who’s the president of Astomos Energy, a joint venture
between Idemitsu Kosan Co. and Mitsubishi Corp. The country may
increase imports from  Australia ,  Canada  and eastern  Africa  in
the coming years, he said, declining to provide estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
