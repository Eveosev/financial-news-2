Middlesex Water Co. (MSEX)  reported a 5.4
percent drop in third-quarter profit mostly as a result of
decreased demand after  Hess Corp. (HES) , its largest customer, shut
oil-refining operations at a New Jersey facility.  The Iselin, New Jersey-based water provider said today in a
statement that net income slipped to $5.8 million from $6.1
million a year earlier, hurt by Hessâ€™s February closure of the
Port Reading refinery and higher precipitation than expected in
the quarter.  Middlesex earlier this year expanded its contract
operations into the military market with an award from the U.S.
Department of Defense to privatize the water-system operations
of Dover Air Force Base in Dover, Delaware.  To contact the reporter on this story:
