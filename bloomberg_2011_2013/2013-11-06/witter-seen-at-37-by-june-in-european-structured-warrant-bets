Twitter Inc. (TWTR)  will trade $12 higher
than the top estimate of its initial public offering price by
June, according to structured product investors who placed
winning bets that  Facebook Inc. (FB)  stock would fall after issue.  The short-message Internet service will raise about $2
billion tomorrow, with shares priced as high as $25, according
to a regulatory filing on Nov. 4. Warrants sold by German broker
 Lang & Schwarz Tradecenter AG (LUS)  indicate a price for the shares of
$36.5 in seven months-time, said Carsten Luetke-Bornefeld, head
of trading at the Dusseldorf-based firm.  UBS AG (UBSN)  and Commerzbank AG are among banks listing 340
structured products for European investors tied to Twitter stock
which starts trading tomorrow. When Facebook raised $16 billion
in the biggest technology IPO of all time, the most actively
traded securities were put warrants, which gain if the shares
drop below a pre-defined level, generating profits of as much as
500 percent for warrant investors.  “The interest in Twitter is comparable to the Facebook
mania, but until the bell rings tomorrow, it awaits to be seen
what investment thesis will prevail,” said Heiko Geiger, head
of public distribution of structured products for Germany and
 Austria  at Bank Vontobel Europe AG in  Frankfurt .  Vontobel is among banks listing 154 call warrants and 41
put warrants on European exchanges, Bloomberg data show. The
securities are being offered with strike prices, the level at
which the securities profit or not, ranging from $40 to $15.  First Indication  Lang & Schwarz AG’s warrants are the first to indicate
where investors think the stock could be priced, Bloomberg data
show. Investors traded 25,203 euros ($34,000) of the broker’s
securities today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In the week after Facebook’s IPO in May 2012, European
investors bet the stock would fall more than 40 percent below
its $38 listing price in seven months. The most actively traded
structured products were put warrants with strike prices as low
as $22. Facebook was  quoted at $49.8  at 11:07 a.m. in  New York .  Twitter boosted its IPO price to $23 to $25 a share, from
an initial estimate of of $17 to $20, which would give the
microblogging service a market capitalization of as much as
$13.6 billion. That would value the company at 11.8 times its
estimated 2014 sales, higher than the 11.4 times price-to-sales
ratio for Facebook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
