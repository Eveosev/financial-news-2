Russian stocks  dropped for a second
day as Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut its outlook for
equities in the world’s biggest energy exporter on concern oil
prices will fall.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  retreated 0.3 percent to 1,500.97 by 12:54
p.m. in Moscow after rising as much as 0.3 percent earlier. OAO
 Mechel (MTLR) ’s preferred shares sank 2 percent to 46.76 rubles, while
OAO Dixy Group retreated 0.9 percent to 420.01 rubles. Of 50
stocks on the gauge, 40 fell and 10 rose.  Bank of America cut its recommendation for  Russia  to a
“modest” overweight from a “big” overweight on concern the
price of Brent crude will drop, according to an e-mailed note
today. Oil in New York added 0.7 percent to $94.03 after
tumbling 1.3 percent yesterday, while Brent increased 0.6
percent to $105.99. Russia receives about half its budget
revenue from natural gas and oil.  “We can envision a scenario where weakness in  China , a
return to dollar strength and progress with Iran negotiations
leads to falling Brent and a bout of Russian underperformance,”
Bank of America analysts led by Michael Harris, said in an e-mailed note.  Bank of America’s top picks among local shares are OAO
Magnit’s local shares, OAO Mobile TeleSystems Russian-traded
stock and OAO Sberbank’s preferred shares.  Russia’s central bank will  probably leave  borrowing costs
unchanged for a 14th month at its Nov. 8 meeting, holding the
one-week auction rate, its new benchmark introduced last month,
at 5.50 percent at an Nov, 8 meeting, according to all 24
economists in a Bloomberg survey. The Micex has climbed 2.2
percent this year and trades 18 percent higher than this year’s
low in June.  Cheapest Valuations  “The market isn’t going anywhere, it’s consolidating
because there’s not much news,” Sergey Kucherenko, who manages
about $50 million in Russian equities at OAO Nomos Bank in
Moscow, said by phone. “Rates are likely to be kept unchanged,
investors are closely watching the macroeconomic data.”  Russia’s November consumer-price growth will probably be
6.1 percent from a year earlier, the  Economy Ministry  said in an
e-mailed report on Nov. 1. Policy makers led by Chairman  Elvira Nabiullina  have pointed to heightened inflation expectations in
holding interest rates for more than a year, as their
counterparts from  Mexico  to  Hungary  opted for stimulus to aid
slumping economies.  The  RTS Index (RTSI$)  was steady at 1,460.83. The dollar-denominated gauge has fallen 1.6 percent since Oct. 10 when it
entered a bull market after climbing 20 percent from this year’s
low.  Russian equities have the cheapest  valuations  among 21
emerging economies monitored by Bloomberg, with shares on the
Micex trading at 4.3 times projected 12-month earnings, compared
with a multiple of 10.6 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.
Ten-day  price swings  on the Micex fell to 5.859 from 9.559
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
