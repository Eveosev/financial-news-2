Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the largest U.S.
home lender, settled legal disputes with federal regulators tied
to mortgage-backed securities for about $335 million.  The accord, which included the  Federal Housing Finance
Agency  and covered agreements from the first and third quarters
of this year, was disclosed today in a regulatory  filing  by San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo. The sum was covered by reserves,
the bank said.  The bank, led by Chief Executive Officer  John Stumpf , is
among U.S. lenders seeking to resolve disputes over flawed loans
sold to government-backed firms. The six biggest U.S. banks have
piled up more than $100 billion in legal costs, including
settlements and lawyers’ fees, since the financial crisis, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Wells Fargo cut its estimate of potential legal bills that
aren’t already covered by reserves to $1 billion at the end of
the third quarter, from $1.1 billion at midyear, the filing
shows. The estimate for potential uncovered costs of buying back
faulty mortgages from investors dropped to $1.4 billion from
$2.2 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
