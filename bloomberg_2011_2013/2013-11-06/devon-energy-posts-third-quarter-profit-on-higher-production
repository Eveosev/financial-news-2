Devon Energy Corp. (DVN) , the second-worst
performer in the past year among a group of U.S. oil and natural
gas producers, posted a third-quarter profit as output gained.  Net income of $429 million, or $1.05 a share, compared with
a loss of $719 million, or $1.80, a year earlier, the Oklahoma
City-based company said today in a statement. Per-share
earnings, excluding one-time items, exceeded the $1.19 average
of 29 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue
increased 46 percent to $2.7 billion.  Devon has narrowed its focus to onshore  North America  after
selling assets in the  Gulf of Mexico  and Brazil in recent years.
Production averaged 691,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in
the third quarter, up from 678,000 in the year-earlier period.
Oil output increased 29 percent from its Permian Basin holdings
and 34 percent from those in the Rocky Mountains.  “They are showing double digit production growth in most
areas,” Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co. in
 St. Louis , said in a phone interview today. “They are achieving
their growth initiatives in these areas more quickly than
anticipated.”  Last month, Devon agreed to move most of its U.S. pipeline
and processing business into a master limited partnership to
increase  cash flow . Devon said it would contribute $4.8 billion
in midstream assets to the planned partnership with  Crosstex
Energy Inc. (XTXI)  The to-be-named entity will consist of an MLP and a
general partner controlling it.  Tax Free  The master-limited partnership structure is attractive for
assets like pipelines with steady returns because an MLP doesn’t
pay corporate income tax and has more cash available to return
to investors.  For the third quarter of 2012, Devon recorded a $1.1
billion non-cash asset impairment resulting from a decline in
gas prices in the previous 12 months.  Devon is the second-worst performer in the past year in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Index,
beating only Southwestern Energy Co.  Devon Energy fell 1.5 percent to $62.82 at 10:07 a.m. in
 New York . The stock has 18 buy, 14 hold and one sell
recommendation from analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
