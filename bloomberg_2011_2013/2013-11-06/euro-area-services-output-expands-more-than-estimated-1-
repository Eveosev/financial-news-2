Euro-area services output  grew more
than initially estimated in October, adding to signs the
currency bloc’s economic recovery is gaining momentum.  An index based on a survey of purchasing managers in the
services industry fell to 51.6 from 52.2 in September, London-based  Markit Economics said  today. That exceeds Markit’s initial
estimate of 50.9. The gauge has been above 50, indicating
expansion, for three months.  The euro-area economy probably grew 0.2 percent in the
third quarter after exiting a record long recession in the
previous three-month period, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of 31 economists. The European Commission yesterday
trimmed its forecast for euro-zone growth next year to 1.1
percent from its 1.2 percent prediction in May.  Markit’s composite index based on a survey of purchasing
managers in the services and manufacturing industries dipped to
51.9 from 52.2 in September, today’s report showed. The
manufacturing gauge was unchanged at 51.3.  “The euro-area economic recovery lost less momentum than
first estimated in October,”  Chris Williamson , Markit’s chief
economist, wrote in today’s report. “The survey signals a mere
0.2 percent quarterly growth rate at the start of the fourth
quarter, unchanged on the third quarter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
