The VCI chemical association, which
represents 1,650 companies including  BASF SE (BAS)  and  Evonik
Industries AG (EVK) , cut for a third time its forecast for sales in
the industry as selling prices drop more than expected.  Revenue in the industry will probably increase by 0.5
percent to 187.7 billion euros ($253.4 billion) this year, the
Frankfurt-based lobby group said today in a statement.
Previously the group had predicted a gain of 1 percent.  BASF and Evonik both said last month that they will
accelerate savings programs and cut jobs in response to slower
demand growth and increased competition from Asian suppliers.
Chemical production will gain 1.5 percent this year, the VCI
said today, sticking to a previous forecast.  “The German  chemical industry  is experiencing an unsettled
year,” the chemical lobby said in today’s statement. “After a
strong second quarter 2013, the third quarter was more
restrained.”  Chemical production remained flat in the third quarter
compared to the previous three months, the VCI said. Selling
prices and sales dropped 1 percent from the second quarter, it
said.  The VCI in December predicted a 2 percent increase in sales
for this year. The lobby reduced its forecast by half a
percentage point in July and September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
