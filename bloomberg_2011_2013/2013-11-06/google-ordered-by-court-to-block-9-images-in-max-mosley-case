Google Inc. (GOOG)  was ordered by a Paris
court to filter nine images linked to Max Mosley in a lawsuit
seeking to block search results referring to a “Nazi-themed”
sex party and the former Formula One president.  Mosley, 73, was awarded 1 euro ($1.35) in damages by the
court in a dispute that goes back to a 2008 story in a U.K.
tabloid newspaper. Google called the ruling “troubling.”  “This decision should worry those who champion the cause
of freedom of expression on the Internet,” Daphne Keller,
associate general counsel at Google, said in an e-mailed
statement.  Mosley won a 60,000-pound ($96,534) breach-of-privacy award
in a U.K. court in 2008 from News Corp.’s now-defunct News of
the World newspaper for publishing the story on a Nazi-themed
“orgy” along with a video. A judge ruled there was no Nazi
theme and the story wasn’t in the public interest. Mosley won a
similar ruling in  France  in 2011 when a judge ordered News Corp.
to pay as much as 32,000 euros in fines and fees over the story.  Mosley in 2011 told a U.K. inquiry investigating the phone-hacking scandal at News Corp. that he filed suits against Google
in Germany and France over the search results.  “Our existing removal process represents an effective way
of helping Mr. Mosley,” Google’s Keller said.  Clara Zerbib, a lawyer for Mosley in France, didn’t
immediately return a call and e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
