General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Sasol Ltd. (SOL) 
are collaborating on a water-technology pilot project that will
clean wastewater from plants producing synthetic fuels and
chemicals and supply biogas as a byproduct for power generation.  The anaerobic membrane technology will be developed at a
new demonstration plant at Sasol’s research campus in Sasolburg
in Free State province, the companies said today in a statement
without disclosing terms.  The development, and expected commercialization, increases
the efficiencies of Sasol’s gas-to-liquids operations, said
Ernst Obersholster, group executive for Sasol’s international
energy division. Sasol expects the technology to be commercially
available in 2015.  The companies said the effort also aims to help limit the
negative impact that  South Africa ’s water scarcity is having on
the economy. Sasol, based in Johannesburg, is the world’s
biggest producer of motor fuel from coal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
