Spot diesel fuel in  New York  Harbor
strengthened relative to futures after  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  shut
a unit at its Trainer refinery and regional stockpiles fell to
the  lowest seasonal level  in more than two decades.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  gained 0.08 cent to 0.08 cent a
gallon above futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:54
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The differential expanded after Delta shut a diesel heater
following a small fire Nov. 2 at the 185,000-barrel-a-day
 Pennsylvania refinery . The company is investigating the cause,
said Adam Gattuso, a spokesman at the plant.  Stockpiles of diesel in the Central Atlantic region known
as PADD 1B, including New York Harbor, slipped 1.9 million
barrels to  18.8 million barrels  in the week ended Nov. 1, the
lowest level for the time of year in government data going back
to 1990, according to Energy Information Administration data.
That was the  eighth consecutive decline .  Inventories dropped as refiners including Phillips 66 and
PBF Energy Inc. carried out seasonal maintenance that reduced
production and as Colonial Pipeline Co. allocated shipments on
lines serving  New Jersey .  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on Brent oil in
 Europe , gained $1.27 to $8.19 a barrel, the highest level since
Sept. 13, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
