Clealco Acucar e Alcool SA, a
Brazilian sugar-cane processor, will buy a mill in Sao Paulo
state for 187 million reais ($82 million) from Usina Campestre,
which has been in  bankruptcy protection  since 2009.  Creditors of Usina Campestre agreed to the sale of its sole
mill yesterday, Jose Bassetto Junior, executive director of
Clementina-based Clealco, said today in a telephone interview.  The funds will be disbursed through December 2018 and help
shareholders of Usina Campestre pay off about 530 million reais
of debt, he said.  Closely held Clealco will invest about 160 million reais in
the plant to double its cane-crushing capacity to 3 million tons
a year and provide working capital, Bassetto said.  Clealco, which owns two mills in Sao Paulo, will have 12
million tons of annual sugar-cane crushing capacity online after
the purchase and expansion.  Officials at Penapolis-based Usina Campestre didn’t
immediately respond to a telephone call and e-mails seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
