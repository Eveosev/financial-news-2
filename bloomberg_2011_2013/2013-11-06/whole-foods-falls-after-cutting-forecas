Whole Foods Market Inc. (WFM) , the largest
natural-foods grocer in the U.S., fell the most in four years
after saying that fiscal 2014 profit would be less than it
previously forecast as same-store sales growth slows.  Profit excluding certain items will be as much as $1.69 a
share in the year ending in September, compared with a previous
projection of as much as $1.72, Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods
said in a statement yesterday. Analysts estimate $1.73 a share,
on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Whole Foods is facing increased competition from expanding
organic and natural-food sellers including  Fairway Group
Holdings Corp. (FWM)  and  Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. (SFM)  The chain has
been adding more of its 365 private-label brand items to attract
price-conscious shoppers. Sales at stores open at least a year
rose 5.9 percent in the fourth quarter, which ended Sept. 29,
the slowest growth in 15 quarters.  “You’ve had Sprouts and you’ve had several other companies
come public that are playing in the same space as Whole Foods,”
Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co. in St. Louis
who advises buying the shares, said in an interview. “That just
heightens the concerns around the Whole Foods story.”  The  shares  fell 11 percent to $57.26 at the close in New
York, the biggest decline since November 2009. Whole Foods has
gained 26 percent this year, while the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index increased 23 percent.  Net income in the fourth quarter rose 7.1 percent to $121
million, or 32 cents a share, from a year earlier. Analysts
projected 31 cents, the average of 28 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Revenue Forecast  The grocer also lowered its revenue growth forecast for
fiscal 2014 to as much as 13 percent from a prior estimate of as
much as 14 percent.  Whole Foods, which has said it can expand to 1,000 U.S.
locations, plans to open as many as 38 new stores in fiscal 2014
after opening 32 in 2013. It’s moving to smaller markets and
recently signed leases to open stores in Dayton,  Ohio , and
Germantown,  Tennessee .  To contact the reporter on this story:
