Ross William Ulbricht, who is charged
with running a billion-dollar online bazaar that sold heroin,
hacking services and phony passports, appeared at a hearing in
federal court in  Manhattan , where prosecutors were granted a
request that he continue to be detained. Ulbricht will pursue
bail later this month, his lawyer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
