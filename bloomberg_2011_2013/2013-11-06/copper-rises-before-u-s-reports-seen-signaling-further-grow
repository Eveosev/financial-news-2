(Corrects to give full name of company in third
paragraph.)  Nickel dropped to a two-week low in
 London  as record inventories are fueling concern that ample
supplies will overwhelm demand for the metal, used to make
stainless steel. Copper also slid.  Stockpiles tracked by the London Metal Exchange, which have
surged 71 percent this year, reached an all-time high of 239,958
metric tons yesterday. Supply will exceed demand this year by
120,000 tons, up from a 92,000-ton surplus in 2012, according to
Barclays Plc.  “Inventories of nickel just keep going up,” Jason Schenker, the president of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin,
Texas-based consultant, said in a telephone interview. “You’ve
got a growing glut of cheap supply hitting the market, and
that’s going to weigh on prices.”  Nickel for delivery in three months declined 1.6 percent to
settle at $14,110 a ton at 5:51 p.m. local time on the LME.
Prices touched $14,059, the lowest since Oct. 18.  The rise in inventories is helping keep traders with bets
on lower prices from buying to close out those positions, making
a so-called short-covering rally less likely, Standard Bank Plc
said in a report yesterday.  Nickel settled below its 30-day moving average, at
$14,177.33 today, for the first time since Oct. 10.  Copper for delivery in three months lost 0.6 percent to
$7,115 a ton ($3.23 a pound) in London. Aluminum and lead
advanced, while tin and zinc fell.  In  New York , copper futures for delivery in December
declined 0.7 percent to close at $3.237 a pound on the Comex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
