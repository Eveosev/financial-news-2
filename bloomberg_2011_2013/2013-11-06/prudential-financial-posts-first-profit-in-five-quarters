Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , the No. 2
U.S. life insurer, swung to a profit in the third quarter,
fueled by pension-transfer deals and the acquisition of a unit
from Hartford Financial Services Group Inc.  Net income  of $1.04 billion compares with a $584 million
loss a year earlier,  Newark , New Jersey-based Prudential said
today in a statement. Operating profit, which excludes some
investments and the results of policies sold before the firm
went public, was $2.94 a share, beating the $2.11  average
estimate  of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer John Strangfeld, 59, is benefiting
from deals struck last year to take on pension obligations from
 Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  and General Motors Co. and  life
insurance  policies from Hartford. Aided by climbing  equity
markets , Prudential posted operating return on equity of more
than  15 percent  in the first nine months of this year, on pace
to beat the company’s 2013 target.  “The earnings are going to be pretty strong because of the
strong equity markets and what happened with  interest rates ,”
Ed Shields, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP, said by
phone before results were announced.  The insurer climbed 0.6 percent to $82.25 in extended
trading at 5:02 p.m. in  New York . Prudential  rallied  53 percent
this year, beating the 24 percent advance of the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index. Larger rival  MetLife Inc. (MET)  is up 46 percent.
Strangfeld posted results after the close of regular trading.  Investment Management  The U.S. retirement solutions and  investment management 
unit recorded adjusting operating income of $1.26 billion,
compared with $506 million a year earlier, fueled by
improvements in capital-market performance and an assumptions
update. The pension deals drove an $82 million improvement in
investment results from a year earlier, Prudential said.  Sales of fixed and variable annuities fell to $2.4 billion,
from $5.93 billion a year earlier, as Prudential lowered payouts
on some of the retirement products.  Investment income climbed 9.2 percent to $2.87 billion.
Book value at Prudential’s main business fell to $70.25 a share
on Sept. 30 from $71.93 three months earlier.  The international insurance segment posted adjusting
operating earnings of $778 million, compared with $782 million a
year earlier. Annualized new-business premiums fell 32 percent
to $644 million, after Prudential raised the prices for some
products or cut crediting rates.  Prudential said it  repurchased  $250 million worth of shares
in the quarter, paying an average of $78.45 apiece. The insurer
authorized a $1 billion buyback in June.  Derivatives, Currencies  The company recorded realized investment losses of $556
million before taxes, as costs tied to derivatives were
partially cushioned by gains tied to fluctuations in the yen.  The last time Prudential posted a quarterly profit was the
three months ended June 30, 2012. Results as measured by
generally accepted accounting principles were hurt in late 2012
and early this year by costs tied to derivatives and
fluctuations in the yen.  New-business premiums from individual life insurance rose
to $165 million from $98 million, driven by universal life
policies, after some rivals retreated from the market. Profit at
the unit that sells individual and group life coverage jumped to
$216 million, from $147 million.  MetLife last week reported operating earnings of $1.34 per
share, missing analysts’ estimates by 2 cents on costs to
increase reserves for disability claims in  Australia . Profit
climbed in the Americas and slipped in  Asia , the New York-based
insurer said.  Prudential purchased Hartford’s individual life business
for $615 million in a reinsurance transaction, adding about
700,000 policies. GM shifted more than $25 billion in pension
obligations and Verizon offloaded about $7.5 billion. The deals
add to assets Prudential manages, while letting the other firms
focus on their main businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
