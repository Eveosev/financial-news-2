Sumitomo Realty & Development Co. (8830) ,
Japan’s third-biggest developer, reported first-half profit rose
59 percent as it sold more homes before the government’s plan to
raise the  sales tax  next year.  Net income rose to 41.9 billion yen ($425 million) in the
six months ended Sept. 30 from 26.4 billion yen a year earlier,
the Tokyo-based company said today in a statement through the
stock exchange. Sales gained 25 percent to 391.5 billion yen.  Demand for homes is increasing as the government plans to
raise the  consumption tax  to 8 percent from 5 percent in April
and amid concerns that  interest rates  will start to rise as the
central bank’s policy of ending deflation will stimulate
economic growth and push up prices. Sumitomo Realty said it sold
75 percent more apartments, houses and land sites in the fiscal
first half compared with the same period year earlier.  Sumitomo Realty kept its net income forecast unchanged at
68 billion yen for the year ending March 2014 on sales of 760
billion yen.  Japan ’s housing starts rose for a 13th month in September,
the longest streak since 1994.  The  shares  declined 1.2 percent to 4,600 yen at the close
of trading in Tokyo following the results. The stock has gained
62 percent this year, outperforming the 53 percent advance by
the 43-member Topix Real Estate Index in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
