Bakken crude sank to the lowest in
more than 19 months relative to the U.S. benchmark as
inventories in the northern Midwest climbed to a record while
production of a competing crude grew.  Bakken oil priced in Clearbrook,  Minnesota , weakened by
$2.75 to $15.75 a barrel less than West Texas Intermediate in
Cushing, Oklahoma, at 4:05 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It’s the largest discount since March 16, 2012.  Bakken is a light, sweet crude from the namesake shale
formation in  North Dakota  and  Montana . Production from North
Dakota’s portion of the field grew to 847,160 barrels a day in
August from less than 10,000 in 2006 on improved use of
horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing.  “They’re running into a situation where they’re just not
able to move it out fast enough,” Carl Larry, president of Oil
Outlooks & Opinions LLC, said by phone from Houston.  Crude supplies in the Midwest excluding Cushing rose by
513,000 barrels to 68.7 million, the highest level on record,
according to data from the Energy Information Administration.  The Syncrude upgrader in Alberta produced 308,300 barrels
of synthetic light, sweet crude a day in October, the most since
April, according to the website of  Canadian Oil Sands Ltd. (COS) , the
plant’s operating partner.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB) ’s Mainline lines 2 and 3 from Alberta to
Superior, Wisconsin, carry as much as 832,000 barrels a day of
light oil and were overbooked by 17 percent for November, the
company said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
