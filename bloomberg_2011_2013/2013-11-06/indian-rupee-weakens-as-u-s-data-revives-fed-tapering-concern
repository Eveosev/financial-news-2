India ’s rupee touched the lowest
level in almost a month as better-than-estimated U.S. data
revived concern the  Federal Reserve  will pare stimulus earlier
than anticipated. Bonds were steady.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s non-manufacturing
index increased to 55.4 in October, compared with 54.4 in the
previous month and in contrast to a Bloomberg survey prediction
of a drop to 54. India’s central bank may cut direct dollar
supplies to oil refiners when it stops offering concessional
swaps for foreign currency raised by lenders on Nov. 30,
according to DBS Bank Ltd.  “While these maneuvers have been priced in, some buoyancy
in the dollar versus rupee should be expected when these are
eventually unwound,” analysts at DBS, including  David Carbon  in
 Singapore , wrote in a research report today. The ISM data has
“kept taper hopes alive,” they wrote, adding that markets
aren’t factoring in any U.S. interest-rate increases.  The rupee fell 0.4 percent to 61.8600 per dollar as of 9:52
a.m. in Mumbai, according to prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 62.0100 earlier, the weakest
level since Oct. 10. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose
36 basis points, or 0.36 percentage point, to 11.25 percent.  The yield on the 7.16 percent government notes due May 2023
was little changed at 8.74 percent, according to prices from the
central bank’s trading system. The rate climbed to as much as
8.77 percent earlier.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards fell 0.4 percent to
63.21 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts fell 0.4 percent to 63.56. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
