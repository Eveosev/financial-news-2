Companies advising  New York ’s public
pension funds, worth more than $350 billion, are being probed by
the state’s top financial regulator in a bid to snuff out
possible conflicts of interest and avoid Detroit-style financial
woes, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The  Department of Financial Services  sent subpoenas to
20 companies that provide consulting services to trustees of the
pension funds in New York state and New York City to ensure the
advice isn’t influenced by outside financial considerations,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
investigation isn’t public.  “The recent financial difficulties in Detroit serve as a
stern wake-up call, demonstrating why strong oversight of New
York’s public pension funds is so important,”  Benjamin Lawsky ,
superintendent of the DFS since its creation in 2011, said in
letters to the pension funds obtained by  Bloomberg News . The New
York Times reported on the letters earlier.  The DFS’s predecessor agency conducted only “limited”
reviews of public pension funds and published them rarely,
Lawsky said in the letters.  The new agency is beefing up its oversight to protect
taxpayers, who pay the public employees and must also foot the
bill if their retirement funds come up short in the future, he
wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
