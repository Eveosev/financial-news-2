Most  Hong Kong   stocks  fell, with the
benchmark index sliding a third day, as energy companies led
declines on the Hang Seng Composite Index.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 0.2 percent to 23,003.69 as of
9:39 a.m. in Hong Kong, with about two shares declining for each
that rose on the 50-member gauge. The Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index of mainland companies lost 0.6 percent to
10,567.63.  The  Hang Seng Index  jumped 16 percent from this year’s low
on June 24 through yesterday as economic data boosted confidence
in China. A private survey yesterday showed expansion in
services industries yesterday after an official non-manufacturing gauge rose to the highest this year. Hong Kong’s
benchmark index  traded  at 11 times estimated earnings yesterday,
compared with 15.9 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  President  Xi Jinping  said the country should speed up its
strategy of using innovation to drive development and realize
full-year economic targets, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported yesterday. The nation’s official growth target is 7.5
percent this year. China’s leaders meet in Beijing Nov. 9-12 to
map out reforms.  Futures on the  S&P 500  gained 0.2 percent today. The equity
gauge dropped 0.3 percent yesterday as investors awaited this
week’s data on economic growth and employment. Faster-than-estimated expansion in a U.S. services gauge in October stoked
speculation the economy is strong enough for the Federal Reserve
to cut stimulus earlier than anticipated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
