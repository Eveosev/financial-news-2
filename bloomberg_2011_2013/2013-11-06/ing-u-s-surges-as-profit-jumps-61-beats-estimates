ING U.S. Inc. (VOYA) , the insurer being
divested by its Dutch parent, posted the  biggest advance  in the
 Russell 1000 index (RIY)  after third-quarter operating earnings
climbed 61 percent, beating analysts’ estimates.  ING U.S.  gained  8.5 percent to $33.59 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York, the largest jump since May. The company rallied 72 percent
since  ING Groep NV (INGA)  sold shares for $19.50 apiece in May.  Operating earnings, which exclude some investments and
results of variable annuities that ING U.S. no longer sells,
increased to $282.8 million, or $1.08 per share, from $175.9
million a year earlier, the company said in a statement today.
Analysts had estimated 66 cents a share, according to a
Bloomberg survey. Rising stock markets and increased investments
from customers added to profits from asset management.  ING U.S. “demonstrated solid performance from its ongoing
business and a faster-than-expected pace of improvement in the
closed block variable-annuity unit,”  Mark Palmer , an analyst at
BTIG LLC, said in a research note on the New York-based company.
He  upgraded  the shares to buy from neutral.  The insurer is planning to rebrand as Voya Financial, and
is being divested by ING Groep as a condition of the Amsterdam-based company’s bailout. ING Groep controls about  57 percent  of
the U.S. unit after two share sales this year. The parent, which
also reported results today, climbed 3.5 percent in Amsterdam.  The return on equity at ING U.S.’s main unit was 9.9
percent this year through Sept. 30, compared with 8.3 percent in
all of 2012, the company said. The insurer is on pace to achieve
its target of at least 12 percent by 2016, Chief Executive
Officer Rodney Martin, 61, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
