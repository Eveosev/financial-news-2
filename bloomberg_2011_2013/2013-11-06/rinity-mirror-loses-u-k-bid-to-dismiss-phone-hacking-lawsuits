Trinity Mirror Plc (TNI)  lost a bid to
dismiss two lawsuits over allegations reporters hacked the phone
of a former soccer player and  David Beckham ’s one-time nanny.  Justice George Mann threw out the bid to block the voice
mail interception claims being made by Garry Flitcroft and Abbie
Gibson. Trinity Mirror’s MGN unit lost a motion to throw out
parts of suits filed by ex-England soccer coach, Sven-Goran Eriksson, and actress Shobna Gulati.  The phone-hacking scandal which has engulfed News Corp.’s
U.K. operations for more than two years, spread to newspapers
run by Trinity Mirror, including the Mirror tabloid, in March
when police arrested four journalists linked to the newspaper.  “The present cases are capable of falling into the
category of cases which require full investigation,” Mann said.
“The alleged activities in this case were covert and, of their
very nature, would be activities of which the victims would know
little or nothing.”  Trinity Mirror, based in  London , said in a statement that
it “continues to contest the four claims vigorously.”  Eight former News Corp. employees are currently standing
trial in London facing a series of charges related to phone
hacking, bribery of public officials and obstruction of Justice.
The U.K. unit’s former chief executive officer, Rebekah Brooks,
and former News of the World editor  Andy Coulson  are both
defendants in the trial, which could last as long as six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
