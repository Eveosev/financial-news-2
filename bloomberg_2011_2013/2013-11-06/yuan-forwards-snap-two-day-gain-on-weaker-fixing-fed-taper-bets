Yuan  forwards fell, snapping a two-day advance, as the central bank cut the onshore reference rate
and Asian currencies dropped on concern an improving U.S.
economy will push the  Federal Reserve  to cut stimulus.  The People’s Bank of China lowered the yuan’s  fixing  by
0.05 percent to 6.1475 per dollar today, after raising it by the
most in almost two weeks yesterday. Data showed U.S. service
industries accelerated in October, with the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s non-manufacturing index rising to 55.4 from 54.4 in
September. Eight out of 11 Asian currencies tracked by Bloomberg
weakened versus, with India’s rupee dropping the most.  “The dollar is doing better and no China-specific news is
out there,” said  Sacha Tihanyi , senior currency strategist at
Scotiabank in Hong Kong. “The fixing is a contributing factor
as well.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.04 percent to
6.1590 per dollar in Hong Kong, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The NDFs traded at a 1 percent  discount  to the
onshore spot rate, which was up 0.07 percent at 6.0927, China
Foreign Exchange Trade System prices show. The spot rate in
Shanghai is allowed to diverge a maximum 1 percent from the
daily fixing.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan was little changed
at 6.0861 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
slipped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.48
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
