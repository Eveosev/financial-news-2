Asian  stocks  rose, snapping a four-day drop on the regional equities benchmark, as Japanese shares
were boosted by a weaker yen and  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia’s  profit surged.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which gets almost 70 percent of revenue
overseas, climbed 1.2 percent. Commonwealth Bank,  Australia ’s
largest lender by market value, advanced 1.3 percent to a record
after saying first-quarter cash profit jumped 14 percent on
lower bad-debt charges.  Itochu Corp. (8001)  rose 2.9 percent as Japan’s
third-largest trading house headed for record annual net income.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index gained 0.3 percent to 141.41 as
of 6:37 p.m. in Hong Kong as eight of the 10 industry groups on
the measure advanced. Japan’s  Topix index  rose 0.8 percent today
and is the best-performing developed equity market in 2013 amid
optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s policies and  Bank of Japan 
monetary easing will stoke inflation.  “It’s a very favorable state for equities,” Richard Lewis, who helps oversee $261 billion as the head of global
equities at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, told Bloomberg TV
from  Melbourne . “ Japan  and the Abenomics story, and the real
drive to get some domestic inflation through the system, is
still certainly attractive.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has climbed 9.3 percent this
year amid unprecedented stimulus from Japan’s central bank and
optimism the  Federal Reserve  will continue its monthly bond
buying into 2014.  Japanese Surge  Japan’s Topix and Nikkei 255 Stock Average surged earlier
as markets reopened after the trading break. More than 8,000
Nikkei 225 futures  contracts  were traded in a 10-minute window
ending at 12:30 p.m. local time, up from 485 in the prior 10
minutes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yen
declined as much as 0.3 percent to 98.77 per dollar today.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index and  South Korea ’s Kospi index
were little changed. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index advanced 0.1
percent. Taiwan’s Taiex Index gained 0.2 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index was little changed and  China ’s
Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.8 percent. Singapore Straits
Times Index lost less than 0.1 percent.  Fed policy makers last week signaled diminishing concern
over higher borrowing costs as they maintained their $85 billion
in monthly bond-buying and sought more evidence of sustained
growth before paring stimulus.  Of the companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that have
reported quarterly results this season and for which Bloomberg
compiles estimates, about half  exceeded  analysts’ estimates on
profit, while 53 percent posted better-than-expected revenue.  Relative Value  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed the past two months,
pushing valuations on the measure to 13.7 times  estimated
earnings , up from a multiple of 12.7 at the end of August,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a
current multiple of 15.9 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and
15 on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, the data show.  Futures on the  S&P 500  added 0.5 percent today. The measure
has rallied almost 24 percent in 2013, challenging 2009 for its
best yearly gain in a decade. The gauge yesterday slid 0.3
percent, snapping a two-day winning streak, as investors awaited
this week’s data on economic growth and employment.  China’s leaders meet in Beijing Nov. 9-12 to map out
reforms as the world’s second-largest economy heads for its
slowest growth in more than two decades.  President  Xi Jinping  said during a visit to  Hunan province 
that the country should speed up its strategy of using
innovation to drive development and make full use of advantages
to realize full-year economic targets, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported.  European Growth  The European Union yesterday cut its forecast for euro-area
growth next year and raised its unemployment estimate as the
economy struggles to regain momentum after a record-long
recession.  Japanese exports advanced as a weaker yen boosted the
overseas income of electronics manufacturers and car makers when
repatriated. Sony added 1.2 percent to 1,689 yen. Canon Inc.,
the world’s biggest camera maker, gained 0.8 percent to 3,090
yen.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , which gets about 80 percent of sales
outside of Japan, climbed 2.8 percent to 885 yen.  Commonwealth Bank rose 1.3 percent to A$77.96. Chief
Executive Officer Ian Narev led the lender to unaudited cash
profit, which excludes one-time items, of A$2.1 billion ($2
billion) in the three months to Sept. 30, from A$1.85 billion
reported a year earlier.  Itochu climbed 2.9 percent to 1,230 yen in  Tokyo  after
reporting that first-half profit increased 15 percent to 165.1
billion yen ($1.68 billion) from a year earlier.  Toyota Outlook  Toyota Motor Corp. erased losses, gaining as much as 1.3
percent after public broadcaster NHK said the world’s largest
carmaker may raise its operating-profit forecast. After the
market closed, the carmaker boosted its earnings forecast.  Acer Inc. slumped 6.9 percent to NT$16.90 after the
Taiwanese semi-conductor maker reported a record loss and the
chairman and chief executive officer resigned.  Fast Retailing Co. (9983) , Asia’s biggest apparel chain, slid 0.8
percent to 32,250 yen after October same-store sales at its
Uniqlo clothing stores in Japan dropped the most since 2010.  Brother Industries Ltd. tumbled 9.3 percent to 1,012 yen
after the Japanese office equipment maker cut its profit
forecast. Canon gained 0.8 percent to 3,090 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
