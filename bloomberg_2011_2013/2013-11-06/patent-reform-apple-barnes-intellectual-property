U.S. lawmakers, influenced by
companies including Cisco Systems Inc., Eli Lilly & Co. and
 Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) , are considering the second set of patent-law
changes in three years as the courts try to race ahead of
Congress.  The goal is to rein in entities that buy patents and demand
royalties from as many companies as possible. Often derided as
“trolls,” such firms filed 19 percent of all patent lawsuits
from 2007 to 2011, the Government Accountability Office found.  Finding a balance among protecting products from knockoff
competition, rewarding inventors for making their ideas public
and limiting nuisance suits has been debated for more than 200
years, even more so now that some lawsuits are targeting users
of ubiquitous technology like e-mail and Wi-Fi.  The U.S. Supreme Court is considering when to penalize
patent owners for filing questionable claims, while the federal
courts’ administrator has proposed disclosure rules that may
lessen litigation costs.  The legislation Congress is considering would do some of
the same things -- make patent companies pay the other side’s
legal fees if they lose and tell the courts to change their
discovery rules.  “You do not need Congress to mandate things courts are
already willing to consider,” Circuit Judge Kathleen O’Malley
of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which
handles all patent appeals, said in a Sept. 17 speech to the
Intellectual Property Owners Association.  The struggle between the courts and Congress has divided
companies along the lines of who gets sued more often.  Google Inc. (GOOG) , Cisco and other technology companies in the
 Coalition for Patent Fairness  back legislation introduced Oct.
23 by Representative Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican who
heads the House Judiciary Committee. It would allow collection
of legal fees from licensing companies that lose at trial and
require they provide more details about patents and how they
were infringed.  Companies like Qualcomm that own many patents and make
money from licensing them say weakening patents would hurt their
business. The Qualcomm-backed Innovation Alliance seeks limited
congressional action, and is pushing lawmakers to stop diverting
money from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which is funded
entirely by user fees.  The Coalition for 21st Century Patent Reform -- made up of
General Electric Co., Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly and other
patent holders -- says the Goodlatte bill takes some power from
courts.  Apple Gets Patent on Proximity-Related Home Automation System  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , maker of the iPhone and iPod, received a patent
on a technology that would enable control of a variety of
devices based on the proximity of a mobile device.  Patent 8,577,293 was issued yesterday, according to the
database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. It covers a
system and method of determining the location of wireless
communication devices and persons and adjusting the operation of
devices based on that location.  Cupertino, California-based Apple said in the patent that
this technology could be used to control such things as lighting
and security systems, garage-door openers, climate controllers
and music systems, and could even pre-heat an oven.  Although presently technology exists for remote control of
all of these devices, Apple said that sometimes events -- such
as being stuck in traffic -- may affect a person’s return home.
Through the use of relay servers, the person’s proximity can be
determined and the desired operations can be initiated when the
person is close to home.  Apple applied for the patent in June 2012 with help from
Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP of Atlanta.  For more patent news, click here.  Trademark  Fila’s Acushnet Unit Sues Over Infringement of Titleist Marks  Fila Korea Ltd. (081660) ’s Acushnet unit filed a trademark lawsuit
against two San Diego residents and 10 unnamed defendants.  The sporting-goods company claims they infringe the
Acushnet “Titleist” and “Foot-Joy” trademarks used with golf
shoes and clothing, including belts, rainwear, gloves and
visors.  According to the complaint filed Nov. 1 in federal court in
San Diego, even though the goods the defendants sell are
“substantially different” from legitimate Acushnet goods, they
use marks that are similar to the company’s trademarks.  Acushnet claims that the infringing goods are of a lesser
quality and are being sold to trade on the fame acquired by the
legitimate Titleist and Foot-Joy goods.  The public is confused as to the source of the counterfeit
goods, and Acushnet claims the reputation of its products and
marks suffers as a result, according to the complaint.  The sporting-goods company seeks a court order barring
further infringement, together with awards of attorney fees,
litigation costs, money damages of $2 million for each
counterfeit Acushnet trademark used, profits derived from the
alleged infringement, and surrender of the money-transfer
systems used by the defendants.  The case is Acushnet Co. v. Yoo, 13-cv-02632, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  California  (San Diego).  ‘Smilin’ Buddha’ Subject of Dispute Between Museum, Bar Owner  A Canadian museum and the owner of a bar that once was the
center of  Vancouver ’s punk scene are battling over the rights to
the “Smilin’ Buddha” neon sign, the Vancouver 24 Hrs. website
 reported .  Robert Jir, who owns the  Smilin’ Buddha Cabaret , registered
the trademark in 1997, and objects to the  Museum of Vancouver ’s
use of the sign’s design on merchandise, according to the
website.  The sign, which depicts a chubby Buddha with a flashing
belly, is  on display  in the museum, Vancouver 24 Hrs. reported.  Museum officials are challenging Jir’s trademark, saying
the sign was only rented to the club by its maker, and that
although Jir registered the trademark, he failed to use it for
many years, according to Vancouver 24 Hrs.  For more trademark news, click here.  Copyright  Barnes & Noble Seeks Dismissal of E-Book Sample Case  Barnes & Noble Inc. (BKS) , the New York-based book-sales chain,
asked a federal court to dismiss a copyright case brought by an
author.  Louis K. Smith sued Barnes & Noble in federal court in New
York in June 2012. He claimed that by allowing the public to
download samples of his e-book “Hardscrabble Zone” after any
relationship with Barnes & Noble ended, the bookseller infringed
his copyrights.  Smith had a contract with a distributor to sell his E-books. The distributor made an arrangement with Barnes & Noble
to sell the book, according to court papers.  In response, Barnes & Noble said in an Oct. 31 filing that
after the distributor provided the book to Barnes & Noble to
sell to retail customers, it never sold a single copy. Although
Smith terminated his relationship with the distributor in
October 2011, no one ever informed Barnes & Noble of this fact,
the company said in court filings.  Barnes & Noble said that the only people who could look at
a sample of Smith’s book after the end of the relationship would
be a user who had previously stored that sample in a “digital
locker” during the period in which the book was available.  The bookseller said only one user ever acquired a sample of
the book through Barnes & Noble, and that user downloaded the
sample seven times. Enabling someone to access content that the
user previously accessed legally isn’t infringement, Barnes &
Noble said.  The company also said the same sample is presently
available for free on both Google Inc.’s Google Books and
 Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  It told the court that the company is entitled
to have the infringement case dismissed.  The case is Smith v. BarnesandNoble.com LLC, 12-cv-04374,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  For more copyright news, click here.  Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage  EMC Claims Pure Storage Hired Ex-Employees to Get Secrets  EMC Corp. (EMC) , the world’s largest maker of storage computers,
filed a trade-secrets misappropriation case against rival Pure
Storage Inc. of Mountain View, California.  The complaint, filed Nov. 4 in federal court in  Boston ,
claims that since August 2011 at least 44 of its technical
engineers and sales professionals have decamped for Pure
Storeage “under suspicious circumstances.”  The ex-employees, who “apparently now comprise over 50
percent of Pure Storage’s entire sales force,” possessed
confidential knowledge about EMC products and their
implementation at some of the company’s “most strategically
valuable customers,” according to the complaint.  The departing employees all had contractual obligations to
Hopkinton, Massachusetts-based EMC, the company said in its
pleadings. These included a requirement they not divulge the
company’s confidential information and not solicit EMC’s
customers or employees for a proscribed period, according to the
complaint.  EMC said although it has has sent at least 27 letters to
Pure Storage’s chief executive officer, the California company
continues to hire former EMC employees and induced them to
solicit EMC’s customers and employees. The company said that it
successfully sued at least six of its former employees and
obtained court orders requiring the return of confidential and
proprietary company property.  The  Massachusetts  company says it’s been harmed by Pure
Storage’s actions, and cited  several examples  of press coverage
of the California company’s  targeting  of EMC.  EMC asked the court to order Pure Storage to quit using the
confidential information, inducing EMC employees to leave and
soliciting EMC’s customers. The company also seeks money damages
and extra damages to punish Pure Storage, as well as awards of
attorney fees and litigation costs.  The complaint is without merit and Pure Storage will fight
the allegations, Hope Nicora, a spokeswoman for the company,
said in an e-mail.  “All employees -- both our own and those of our
competitors -- should be free to follow their dreams and support
their families as they see fit, provided they honor their lawful
commitments and safeguard the IP of past employer,” Scott Dietzen, Pure Storage’s chief executive officer, said in a
statement. Pure Storage “will not be deterred” from hiring
“great people,” he said.’  The case is EMC Corp. v. Pure Storage Inc., 13-cv-12789,
U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston).  To contact the reporter on this story:
