Ericsson AB (ERICB) , the world’s largest
maker of wireless networks, forecast the market for such
equipment will keep expanding 3 percent or more annually for the
next few years as phone carriers cope with rising data use.  Ericsson said today the network-gear market will grow an
average of 3 percent to 5 percent through 2016, extending its
earlier forecast for that pace through 2015. The market for
related services will grow 5 percent to 7 percent a year,
Stockholm-based Ericsson said.  Ericsson is competing against  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  and China’s Huawei
Technologies Co. as carriers expand and upgrade their networks
amid rising demand for mobile video, music and data services.
While  revenue  in the third quarter declined in North America and
 Japan  as large coverage projects peaked, the European market is
starting to shrug off effects of the financial crisis and
carriers such as Vodafone Group Plc ramp up spending.  “What you’re seeing is some growth in the market, but I
don’t think the numbers will impress anybody,” said Lars Soederfjell, an analyst at Aalandsbanken in Stockholm. “It’ll
be up to Ericsson to capitalize on this and improve
profitability.”  Shares of Ericsson rose 1.4 percent to 78.75 kronor at
10:01 a.m. in Stockholm, valuing the company at 259 billion
kronor ($40 billion). They had gained 19 percent this year
through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
