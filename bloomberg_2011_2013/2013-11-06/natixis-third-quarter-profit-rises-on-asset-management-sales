Natixis SA (KN) , the investment-banking
and asset-management unit of  France ’s second-largest bank by
branches, said third-quarter profit rose 38 percent on higher
investment-banking and asset-management revenues.  Net income rose to 217 million euros ($293.5 million) from
157 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company said
in an e-mailed statement today. That beat the 175 million-euro
average estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Natixis, slated to announce its 2017 targets next week,
unlike most rivals saw its debt-trading revenue rise in the
third quarter. Natixis’s capital-markets sales climbed 9
percent, with revenue from equities trading up 24 percent and
fixed-income trading up 4 percent, helped by demand from Asian
and U.S. clients, the bank said.  Pretax profit at Natixis’s savings unit, which includes
asset management, insurance and private banking, jumped 33
percent in the third quarter to 144 million euros, the bank
said. Asset-management revenue rose 9 percent to 448 million
euros, boosted by 11.2 billion euros of net inflows, it said.  Natixis is buying a 60 percent stake in its parent Groupe
BPCE’s insurance business to create a new division combining
their insurance activities, the bank said in a separate
statement. BPCE’s insurance unit had net income of 37.7 million
euros, Natixis said, without providing the financial terms of
the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
