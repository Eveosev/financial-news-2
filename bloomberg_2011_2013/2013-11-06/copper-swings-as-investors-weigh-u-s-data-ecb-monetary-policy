Copper swung between gains and losses
as investors weighed upcoming U.S. economic data and a review of
 interest rates  in the euro region.  The contract for delivery in three months was little
changed at $7,151.25 per metric ton at 10:30 a.m. in Shanghai
after gaining as much as 0.3 percent and losing as much as 0.2
percent. Futures closed at $7,149 on Nov. 4, the lowest level
since Oct. 10. The metal has lost 9.8 percent this year.  A government report tomorrow is forecast to show the  U.S.
economy  grew at a 2 percent annualized rate in the third
quarter, compared with a 2.5 percent increase in the previous
three months. A separate Bloomberg survey of economists
indicates ECB President  Mario Draghi  will keep the region’s
refinancing rate on hold at 0.5 percent tomorrow, as banks
including UBS AG and Bank of America Corp. are predicting a cut
to 0.25 percent. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and BNP Paribas SA are
among firms projecting Draghi will hold off on reductions until
December.  “Investors are hesitant because the interpretation of the
U.S. data and the European  monetary policy  could indirectly
impact when the Fed starts tapering bond purchases,” said Xu Liping, an analyst at HNA Topwin Futures Co. in Shanghai.  Futures for delivery in December fell 0.2 percent to $3.251
a pound on the Comex in New York. The metal for delivery in
January on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 0.4 percent to
51,420  yuan  ($8,434) a ton.  On the LME, zinc rose and tin fell. Aluminum, lead and
nickel were little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
