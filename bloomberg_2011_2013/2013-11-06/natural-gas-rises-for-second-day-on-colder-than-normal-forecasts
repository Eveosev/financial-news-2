Natural gas rose for a second day in
New York on forecasts for colder-than-normal weather in the U.S.
that may boost demand for heating.  Futures for December delivery gained as much as 0.9 percent
to $3.496 per million British thermal units in electronic
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and was at $3.49 at
11:44 a.m. Singapore time. The volume of all futures traded was
about 44 percent less than the 100-day average. The contract
climbed 0.6 percent to $3.466 yesterday, snapping a three-day
losing streak.  Temperatures may be below-normal on the East Coast and in
parts of the Midwest through Nov. 9 before moderating next week,
according to MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . The
low in  Boston  on Nov. 8 may be 36 degrees Fahrenheit (2
Celsius), 4 less than usual, said AccuWeather Inc. in State
College,  Pennsylvania .  The low in  Cleveland  on Nov. 8 may be 35 degrees
Fahrenheit, 7 less than usual, AccuWeather data show. About 49
percent of U.S. households use gas for heating, according to the
