The HSBC  Purchasing Managers ’ Index
for the  United Arab Emirates , the second-biggest Arab economy
held up at the highest level in 29 months in October and almost
caught up with  Saudi Arabia ’s measure for the first time  The U.A.E.’s PMI was little changed from the previous month
at 56.3 points, while Saudi Arabia’s gauge fell two points to
56.7, HSBC said in an e-mailed report yesterday. The new orders
sub-index for the U.A.E. fell “only half a point from the all-time high it reached in September” suggesting “continued gains
for the non-oil private sector over the coming months,” Dubai-based HSBC economists  Simon Williams  and Liz Martins wrote.  The U.A.E.’s economic growth is catching up with the rest
of the region four years after Dubai, the country’s financial
hub, teetered on the brink of default. Gross domestic product
may grow 4.3 percent this year and 4.6 percent in 2014, HSBC
said last month, raising its forecasts from 4 percent and 4.1
percent respectively.  Saudi Arabia’s PMI indicates a “slightly more moderate
pace of growth in the private sector,” HSBC said. The figures,
though, are still “not only in positive territory, indicating
continued expansion, but they are also substantially higher than
almost all of the other global PMIs.”  The Purchasing Managers’ Index, which is seasonally
adjusted, is based on data compiled from monthly replies to
questionnaires sent to executives in 400 companies in each
country’s industrial and service sectors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
