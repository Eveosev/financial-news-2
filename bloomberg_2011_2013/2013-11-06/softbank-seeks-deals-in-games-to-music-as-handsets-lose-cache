SoftBank Corp. (9984) , the Japanese wireless
carrier involved in more than a dozen deals the past year, wants
to acquire makers of games, music and videos as it tries to
generate more revenue from smartphone users.  SoftBank plans to offer exclusive and prioritized content
to differentiate itself from rivals selling Apple Inc.’s iPhone
and other high-end handsets, Yoshimitsu Goto, general manager
for finance, said in an interview yesterday. NTT Docomo Inc.,
 Japan ’s largest mobile carrier, began offering the iPhone in
September to keep pace with SoftBank and KDDI Corp.  “Strong content helps to increase subscribers,” said
Tomoaki Kawasaki, an analyst at Iwai Cosmo Holdings Inc. in
Tokyo. “Smartphones and tablets are replacing specialized game
machines so some gamers may use SoftBank mobiles if it has
strong content. It’s the same for music and videos.”  SoftBank said last month that sales will reach more than 6
trillion yen ($61 billion) in the year ending in March, and it
reiterated an earlier projection for annual operating income of
at least 1 trillion yen. That revenue is helping SoftBank
underwrite acquisitions.  “We have to consider boosting content offerings,” Goto
said in  Tokyo  yesterday. “Acquisitions are among the most
important strategies for us.” The company is not negotiating a
deal currently, he said.  SoftBank  fell  0.9 percent to close at 7,480 yen in Tokyo
trading. The shares have more than doubled this year while the
benchmark Topix index has added 38 percent.  Alibaba IPO  The company founded by billionaire Masayoshi Son paid $21.6
billion for Sprint Corp. in July before adding agreements for
majority stakes in gamemaker Supercell Oy and U.S. mobile phone
distributor Brightstar Corp. in October. SoftBank plans to spend
$16 billion during the next two years for faster U.S. services
as it tries to catch AT&T Inc. and  Verizon Wireless .  SoftBank also plans to keep its stake in Alibaba Group
Holding Ltd. if  China ’s largest e-commerce company proceeds with
what may be the biggest initial public offering since Facebook
Inc. The Tokyo-based wireless carrier holds about 37 percent of
Alibaba and hasn’t told the Chinese company when to hold an IPO
or where to hold it, Goto said.  Hangzhou-based Alibaba is worth as much as $190 billion,
analysts at  Sanford Bernstein  said last month. That potentially
values SoftBank’s stake at $70 billion.  Universal Bid  “Alibaba is among the most important companies in our
group, so our plan is to hold the stake for a long period of
time,” Goto said. “What’s important for us as a shareholder in
Alibaba is that the company continues increasing its enterprise
value. An IPO is just a passing point to do that.”  Earlier this year, SoftBank made an $8.5 billion bid for
Vivendi SA’s  Universal Music Group  that was rejected by the
French media company, according to people with knowledge of the
proposal. The company also purchased local competitor eAccess
Ltd. to meet bandwidth demand for smartphones.  SoftBank led a $1.53 billion agreement for a 51 percent
stake in Supercell last month that values the maker of “Clash
of Clans” at $3 billion. The deal evolved after the Finnish
gamemaker began working with  GungHo Online Entertainment Inc. (3765) ,
led by the SoftBank president’s younger brother, Taizo Son.  SoftBank owns stakes in more than 1,000 Internet
businesses, and Masayoshi Son is Japan’s second-richest man with
a net worth of $14.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg
Billionaires Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
