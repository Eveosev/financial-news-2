Gafisa SA (GFSA3)  rallied the most in a week
after the Brazilian homebuilder posted a quarterly profit for
the first time in a year.  The shares rose 0.3 percent to 2.90 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, after earlier climbing as much as 6.6
percent. Trading volume was more than double the three-month
daily average. It was the only stock that gained today in the
BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index, which lost 3.1 percent.  Adjusted net income for the three months ended in September
was 15.8 million reais ($6.9 million), according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg after the company released results
yesterday. The average estimate of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was 12.7 million reais.  While the Sao Paulo-based company had already released some
preliminary figures including booked sales, a 5.19 percentage
point increase in gross margins to 27.6 percent was a “positive
surprise,” compared with a forecast for 22.7 percent, Banco
Itau BBA analysts led by David Lawant said in a research note to
clients. The improvement is a result of the greater impact of
newer projects on revenue, Gafisa said in a regulatory filing.  “Numbers were better than our expectation,” the Itau
analysts wrote. “Gross margins were a positive surprise and
improved on a quarterly basis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
