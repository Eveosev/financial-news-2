Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 China  fell for a second day on concern that construction will
slow in winter, crimping demand.  Rebar for May delivery, the most-active contract by volume
on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, fell as much as 0.9 percent to
3,636 yuan ($596) a metric ton, and traded 3,649 yuan a ton at
11:30 a.m. local time.  The total number of building projects in China that
received tender bids in October fell 28 percent from September
to 9,851, while the combined value of contracts fell 21 percent,
Shenhua Futures Co. wrote in a research report today. Rail
construction also slowed, it said.  “On the demand side, we haven’t see much optimism, and
going toward the year-end things will only slow down even
more,” said Wu Zhili, a Shenzhen-based analyst for Shenhua
Futures.  Iron ore  for May delivery on the Dalian Commodity Exchange
fell 0.1 percent to 945  yuan  a ton. The steel-making material
for immediate delivery at Tianjin port tracked by The Steel
Index rose 0.7 percent to 136.80 yuan a ton yesterday.  The spot price of rebar rose 0.4 percent to 3,534 yuan a
ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
