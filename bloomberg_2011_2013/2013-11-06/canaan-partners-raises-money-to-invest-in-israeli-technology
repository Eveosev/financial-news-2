Venture capital investor  Canaan
Partners  is raising a $60 million fund to invest in early-stage
Israeli technology companies, said general partner Izhar Shay.  “The Israeli market represents a unique opportunity,”
Shay said in an interview in  Tel Aviv , noting that there have
been 800 exits of Israeli startup companies for a total of $45
billion over the past 10 years. “This is a healthy environment
and we wanted to do more than we are doing today.”  Last year, mergers and acquisitions of Israeli companies
totaled $9.7 billion, just short of the $10 billion reached in
2006, a sum that also included initial public offerings,
according to IVC Research Center, which monitors the local
technology industry.  The fund, Canaan Partners Israel, is backed by the Canaan
Partners Global fund and is attracting a mix of local and
foreign investors, Shay said. It is the investor’s first fund
solely directed at Israel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
