German stocks  advanced, rebounding
from yesterday’s decline, as investors awaited tomorrow’s
monetary-policy decision from the European Central Bank.  Kloeckner & Co SE rose 1.6 percent after saying third-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization doubled, beating analyst estimates.  Axel Springer
AG (SPR)  gained 2.6 percent after reporting quarterly revenue that
exceeded forecasts. K+S AG fell the most on the gauge, losing
3.1 percent after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded its
rating on Europe’s biggest potash distributor to junk.  The  DAX (DAX)  climbed 0.3 percent to 9,039.83 at 10:11 a.m. in
 Frankfurt . The benchmark gauge has risen 19 percent this year as
central banks around the world pledged to leave interest rates
low for a prolonged period. The broader HDAX Index added 0.4
percent today.  “Investors are expecting some very dovish comments from
the ECB tomorrow,” Christoph Hock, an equity sales trader at
Alpha Wertpapierhandels GmbH in Frankfurt, said in an e-mail.
“There is speculation about a rate cut and a new long-term
refinancing operation on the cards for December.”  Three of 70 economists’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg
 predict  the  European Central Bank  will cut its benchmark
 interest rate  to 0.25 percent at its policy meeting tomorrow,
while eight of 38 respondents in a separate survey forecast a
cut in December.  A report due at 12 p.m. in Berlin today may show German
 factory orders  increased 0.5 percent in September from August,
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  predicted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
