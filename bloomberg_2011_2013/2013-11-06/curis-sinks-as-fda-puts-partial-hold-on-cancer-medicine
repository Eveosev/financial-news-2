Curis Inc. (CRIS) , a developer of cancer
medicines, fell the most in more than three years after U.S.
regulators placed a partial hold on a trial of its drug for
solid tumors after a patient died from liver failure.  Curis dropped 21 percent to $3.08 at 10:16 a.m.  New York 
time after falling to $3.03 in its biggest intraday decline
since June 2010. The shares of the Lexington, Massachusetts-based company had risen 13 percent this year through yesterday.  The  Food and Drug Administration  said no new patients
should be given the experimental medicine until an analysis of
how to proceed is done, the company said today in a statement.
The trial of CUDC-427 was in the first of three phases of
studies generally required for regulatory approval. No patients
are currently being treated with the drug, Curis said.  “Partial holds and development delays are not unusual,
especially at this stage,” Adnan Butt, an analyst with  RBC
Capital Markets , wrote in a research note. “Nevertheless they
add to perceived risk and delay developments by at least a
couple of months potentially.”  The patient, who had  breast cancer  that had spread to the
liver, lungs, bones and ovaries, developed problems with liver
function and died a month after discontinuing the drug, the
company said. No other participants had experienced similar
liver issues, Curis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
