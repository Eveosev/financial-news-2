Mark Lewis, head of energy research
at  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s commodities unit, left last month after 14
years with the company.  Lewis, 47, declined to comment on his plans when contacted
today by telephone. He covered markets including European Union
natural gas, power and EU carbon allowances from Paris.  “We decided to re-orientate our research away from carbon
and toward other markets, specifically bulks,” Gael Gunubu, a
spokesman for the bank in London, said by e-mail. So-called bulk
commodities typically include minerals such as iron ore, a
steelmaking raw material.  Banks including Barclays Plc and brokers such as GFI Group
Inc. have cut back on employees serving carbon markets, as
regulators struggle to eliminate a supply glut. Benchmark EU
carbon permits plunged 74 percent in the past five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
