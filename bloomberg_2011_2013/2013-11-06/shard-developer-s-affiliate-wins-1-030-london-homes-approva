Sellar Design and Development Ltd.,
an affiliate of the developer of Western Europe’s tallest tower,
won preliminary approval for more than 1,000 London homes in a
venture with  Investec Plc. (INVP)   The partners will also develop stores, a cinema and a
health center by 2023 after Southwark Council members yesterday
voted 4-2 in favor of the project on Surrey Quays Road in the
Canada Water district. The development will include a 40-story
tower and more than 230 affordable homes, according to a filing
to the borough.  Sellar Design and Development is affiliated with Sellar
Property Group Ltd., which developed The Shard skyscraper in
central London with the Qatar Central Bank. The tower at Canada
Water will be almost half the height of that Renzo Piano-designed skyscraper.  The Surrey Quays Road tower will be beside the water “to
make the town square as large as possible,” designers including
David Chipperfield Architects wrote in a  filing  to the borough.
“It forms the pinnacle of a skyline defined by earlier
developments.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
