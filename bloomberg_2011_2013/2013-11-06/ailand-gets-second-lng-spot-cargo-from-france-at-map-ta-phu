PTT Pcl (PTT) , Thailand’s importer of
liquefied natural gas, received its second spot cargo from
 France  at its Map Ta Phut terminal, ship-tracking data show.  The Methane Alison Victoria, with a capacity of about
145,000 cubic meters, arrived today at the Gulf of Thailand
facility, according to transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on
Bloomberg. The vessel loaded the supercooled gas from storage at
the Fos-sur-Mer LNG terminal in southern France and departed
Oct. 1.  Elengy SA, a unit of French utility GDF Suez SA, owns and
operates the Fos-sur-Mer facility. France doesn’t produce LNG.  The cargo is the second from France to arrive at Map Ta
Phut. PTT received a 63,291 metric ton shipment from the
European country in May, according to data from  Thailand ’s
customs service.  PTT’s Map Ta Phut terminal in Rayong has a capacity of 5
million tons a year. The company, Southeast Asia’s first LNG
importer, signed a long-term contract with Qatargas in December
2012 for 2 million tons annually for 20 years starting in 2015.
Thailand has no long-term contracts with France, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
