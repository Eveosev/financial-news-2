PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) 
said it received a subpoena from the U.S. Small Business
Administration about the bank’s relationship with Jade Capital &
Investments LLC.  The subpoena concerned possible bank fraud and money
laundering by people associated with Jade, Pittsburgh-based PNC
said today in a regulatory filing. The bank said it’s
cooperating with the probe.  Jade, a loan broker based in Woodbridge, Virginia, used
phony documents to persuade SBA officials to back loans through
banks including PNC and  M&T Bank Corp. (MTB) , U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein said in March. A broker at Jade was sentenced in June
to more than 15 years in prison for conspiring to commit bank
fraud, Rosenstein said.  Harry Trainor, an attorney at Trainor Billman Bennett &
Milko LLP in Annapolis, Maryland, who represented one of the
Jade brokers, didn’t immediately respond to a phone message
requesting comment.  Fred Solomon , a PNC spokesman, declined to
comment.  PNC rose 0.8 percent to $73.88 in New York. It has advanced
27 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
