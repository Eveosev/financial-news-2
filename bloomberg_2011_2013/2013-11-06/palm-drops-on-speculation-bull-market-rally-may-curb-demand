Palm oil  declined for a second day to
the lowest level in a week on speculation that last week’s rally
into a bull market will curb importers’ demand.  The contract for delivery in January lost 1.3 percent to
2,547 ringgit ($801) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives, matching the Oct. 30 close for most-active futures.
Palm for physical delivery in November was at 2,580 ringgit
today, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Futures increased 7.5 percent last week, the most since
April 2009, and are heading for the first annual gain in three
years on speculation that output in top producers Indonesia and
Malaysia may be less than analysts expected. Prices rose to
2,628 ringgit on Nov. 1, the highest close since September 2012
and 21 percent more than the 2,167 settlement on July 29,
meeting the common definition of a  bull market .  “Buyers are confused the way prices have gone up,” said
Vijay Mehta, director of Commodity Links Pte in  Singapore .
“They think prices are on the higher side.”  Production in Malaysia fell 2.1 percent to 1.87 million
tons from a month earlier, according to the median of six
estimates from plantation companies, analysts and traders
compiled by Bloomberg. Exports were little changed at 1.6
million tons, while reserves rose 3.4 percent to 1.84 million
tons, the highest since April, the survey showed. The Malaysian
Palm Oil Board is scheduled to release the data on Nov. 11.  Soybean oil for December delivery rose 0.1 percent to 41.20
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans for
delivery in January climbed 0.2 percent to $12.5325 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for May delivery dropped 0.3 percent to
close at 6,270  yuan  ($1,029) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange  and  soybean oil  fell 0.9 percent to end at 7,206 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
