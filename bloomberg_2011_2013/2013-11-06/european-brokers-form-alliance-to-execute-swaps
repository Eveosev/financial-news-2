(Corrects spelling of regulator’s name in third paragraph
of story published Oct. 9.)  Three European brokers -- RP Martin
Holdings Ltd., CIMD SA and OTCex Group -- have joined together
to select swap-execution facilities as they prepare for the U.S.
to introduce more parts of the Dodd-Frank Act.  The three companies formed the Interdealer Broker Alliance
to interact with the SEFs as a single broker, they said in a
statement. They will retain their direct relationships with
clients, while the SEFs carry out execution. The brokerages will
pick three SEFs by the end of October. The group has spoken to
other independent brokers about joining.  The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act created SEFs to bring greater
competition and transparency to swaps trading. The U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission will oversee the new
platforms, which came into existence on Oct. 2. Largely
unregulated trades helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis and led to
the $182.5 billion taxpayer-rescue of insurer American
International Group Inc.  Gary Gensler , the CFTC’s chairman, has insisted that SEFs
register by the deadline. Even so, the agency has granted
temporary delays to some other aspects of the swaps rules.  The European Commission has attempted to win exemptions
from the U.S. rules on swaps-trading platforms.  Michel Barnier ,
the financial services commissioner, didn’t reach a deal with
the CFTC because the shutdown of the American government from
Oct. 1 forced agencies to close many of their offices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
