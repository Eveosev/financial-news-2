Hungary is planning to tap international bond markets again this year as the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain monetary stimulus helps boost demand for debt, Economy Minister  Mihaly Varga  said.  The cabinet, which sold $3.25 billion of bonds in February, wants to sell more foreign debt in 2013, probably in dollars, Varga said yesterday in an interview in Budapest. This year’s budget financing is ensured even without an issue, he said.  “At the time of the February bond sale, the government’s intention was to raise $2 billion and this is roughly the amount one can expect in a  bond issue  in the remainder of the year,” Varga said. The dollar market is the most liquid and provided “very favorable feedback” in February, he said.  That sale was the first time  Hungary  had tapped international markets in 21 months. The eastern European nation, which exited its second recession in four years in the first quarter, paid off the rest of a 2008 International Monetary Fund loan ahead of schedule in August and has a 1 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) note due for repayment in January.  Yields on the government’s dollar bond due 2023, which traded at 5.21 percent after they were first sold in February, were up to 5.68 percent today. The forint strengthened 0.1 percent to 296.98 per euro.  Regional Champion  Hungary’s dollar debt has returned 3 percent this year, eastern  Europe ’s biggest advance and a better performance than the Bloomberg Emerging Market Sovereign-Debt  Index (BEMS) , which has declined 5 percent. Five-year credit-default swaps, which insure against non-payment, traded at 267 basis points today, within 20 basis points, or 0.2 percentage point, of a 12-month low reached Oct. 23.  Eastern European nations are tapping international bond markets, with Poland and  Romania  selling Eurobonds in the last month. Serbia has mandated banks for investor meetings in the U.S. and the U.K., which may be followed by a debt offering, a person familiar with the plan, who asked not to be identified because details are private, said yesterday.  Hungary filed a “shelf” registration to issue as much as $5 billion of bonds in the U.S in one or more offerings, according to a document published by the Securities and Exchange Commission in  New York  on Sept. 17.  Rating Affirmed  Standard & Poor’s  affirmed Hungary’s credit rating at BB, two levels below investment grade and on par with Guatemala and  Costa Rica , with a negative outlook on Oct. 25. It cited “weak” growth prospects and high debt.  The latest European Union projections on Hungary’s economic performance may help boost investor confidence, Varga said.  The  economy  is set for a gradual recovery, with gross domestic product to rise 0.7 percent this year, 1.8 percent in 2014 and 2.1 percent in 2015, the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said yesterday. The country will probably keep its  budget deficit  within the bloc’s limit of 3 percent of GDP through 2015, according to the forecast.  The government doesn’t need to take additional steps to meet its 2013 and 2014  budget-gap  targets, Varga said.  Premier  Viktor Orban , who faces elections in 2014, is striving to fortify the economy. The central bank, which cut the benchmark  interest rate  for a 15th month in October to a record 3.4 percent, is also providing as much as 2.75 trillion forint of interest-free funds to banks to boost credit to small and medium-size companies.  “There’s still room and a possibility for further  interest-rate  cuts” because inflation is slower than policy makers’ 3 percent target, Varga said. The independent Monetary Council is charged with making these decision after “thorough reviews.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Edith Balazs in Budapest at  ebalazs1@bloomberg.net ; Zoltan Simon in Budapest at  zsimon@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: James M.
