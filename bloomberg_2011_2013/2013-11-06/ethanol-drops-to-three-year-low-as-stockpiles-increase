Ethanol slipped to a three-year low
after a government report showed stockpiles of the biofuel
rebounded from a record low.  Futures dropped with corn on forecasts of a record harvest
for the grain. Ethanol’s discount to gasoline widened 12.49
cents to 94.1 cents a gallon after the Energy Information
Administration said  inventories  of the biofuel jumped 1.4
percent to 15.2 million barrels, while  production  declined 1
percent to 902,000 barrels a day.  “Stocks rose, but just not a whole lot,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant with INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa .
“The market’s a bit oversold, so I’d be surprised if we didn’t
try to firm up.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery decreased 1.3
cents, or 0.8 percent, to settle at $1.607 a gallon, the lowest
level since July 26, 2010. Prices have declined 27 percent this
year.  Gasoline for December delivery rose 3.19 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.548 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The contract covers reformulated gasoline made to be blended
with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn, which is used to make ethanol in the U.S., also
slipped to a three-year low. Corn for December delivery dropped
3.75 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $4.2125 a bushel in  Chicago . The
December crush spread of corn to ethanol was 8 cents, up from 7
cents yesterday. About one-third of the corn crop, estimated at
more than 14 million bushels this year, is expected to go to
ethanol output.  Biofuel Mandate  The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed a
reduction in the amount of renewable fuels that refiners must
blend into gasoline and diesel next year, according to a draft
obtained by Bloomberg on Oct. 10. An energy law passed in 2007
established the escalating requirements for ethanol use. The
U.S. is using less oil than it did in 2008.  The proposal has been sent to the Office of Management and
Budget for review. Blackford said traders are hesitant to place
bets until the official proposal is released.  “You can’t market under those conditions,” Blackford
said. “It’s holding the market hostage.”  RINs, certificates attached to each gallon of  corn-based 
ethanol that are submitted to the government and can be traded
among companies, rose 6 cents to 28 cents a gallon. Advanced
RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based
ethanol, climbed 7 cents to 37 cents, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Ethanol Imports  The U.S. hasn’t made any  foreign purchases  of the biofuel
since Sept. 27, the longest such period since March 2012,
according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm.  In cash market trading, ethanol slid 8 cents to $1.94 in
New York, 4 cents to $1.85 on the West Coast, 2.5 cents to $1.70
in Chicago and 1.5 cents to $1.80 on the  Gulf Coast , data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Gulf’s discount to the West Coast gained 2.5 cents to 5
cents, while  New York ’s premium to Chicago narrowed 5.5 cents to
24 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
