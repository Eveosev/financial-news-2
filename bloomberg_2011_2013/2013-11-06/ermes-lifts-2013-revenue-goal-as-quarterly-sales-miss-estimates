Hermes International SCA (RMS) , the French
maker of Kelly bags and silk scarves, raised its full-year
revenue target even after reporting third-quarter sales that
trailed analysts’ estimates as currency moves weighed on growth.  Annual revenue could exceed 11 percent at constant exchange
rates, the Paris-based company said today in a statement,
adjusting an earlier forecast of more than 10 percent growth.  Third-quarter sales climbed 5.5 percent to 895.5 million
euros ($1.21 billion), Hermes said, trailing the 908 million-euro median of 9 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Excluding currency moves, sales advanced 13 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
