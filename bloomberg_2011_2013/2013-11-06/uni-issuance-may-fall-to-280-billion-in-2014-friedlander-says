Issuance in the $3.7 trillion U.S.
municipal market may fall to $280 billion in 2014, the lowest
since 2011, said George Friedlander, chief municipal strategist
at Citigroup Inc.  Localities have issued $255 billion of long-term debt this
year through Nov. 1, down 15 percent from last year’s pace, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. New York-based Citigroup forecasts
$325 billion of sales for 2013. The bank’s projected tally for
next year would be the second-smallest total since 2005, the
 data  show.  “We’re looking at a rather modest calendar,” Friedlander
said today at the Bloomberg Link State & Municipal Finance
Conference in  New York . “Refundings will just continue to
dwindle.”  Municipalities are hesitant to take on new projects after
the worst recession since the 1930s ended more than four years
ago, even as cities project their first revenue increase since
2006. Local governments nationwide asked voters yesterday to
approve about $18 billion of bonds for schools, hospitals and
streets, less than half the 2007 record for an off-year
election.  Volume has also dropped as refinancing has proved less
economical after  interest rates  rose from generational lows.
Benchmark 10-year yields are about  2.68 percent , compared with
as little as 1.52 percent in December, Bloomberg data show.
Refunding sales made up more than 60 percent of issuance last
year, the data show.  Like Minds  Friedlander joins Phil Fischer, head of muni research at
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in forecasting fewer new bonds.
Fischer said in an Oct. 4 report that issuance will total $330
billion in 2014, about the same as this year. That compares with
$408 billion of sales in 2010, the biggest yearly amount since
at least 2003.  The prospect of changes to the tax-exemption on municipal
debt is keeping the securities cheaper than they should be given
the muted supply, said  John Dillon , chief muni strategist at
Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.  The ratio of 10-year muni yields to those on similar-maturity Treasuries, a gauge of relative value, has been above
100 percent since June, Bloomberg data show. It compares with an
average of 94 percent since 2001. The higher the number, the
cheaper munis are compared with federal securities.  The figure should be around 90 percent given the decline in
bond sales, Dillon said.  There’s “fair value” around 93 percent to 95 percent, he
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
