South Korea’s three-year bond yield
rose to a seven-week high and the won fell after data showing
U.S. service industries unexpectedly accelerated in October
bolstered the case for the Federal Reserve to cut stimulus.  The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing
index increased to 55.4 from 54.4 in September, while the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey was for a drop to 54. Global
funds sold more South Korean bond futures than they bought for a
sixth day and pulled $257 million from stocks in the last two
days, exchange data show. The Federal Open Market Committee
maintained its bond purchases on Oct. 30, noting the U.S.
economy is showing signs of “underlying strength.”  “Foreign investors have been selling Korean assets since
last week as speculation is on the rise that the Fed tapering
may begin earlier than expected,” said Lee Jae Seung, a fixed-income analyst at KB Investment & Securities Co. in  Seoul .  The yield on the 2.75 percent sovereign bonds due June 2016
rose one basis point to 2.9 percent, the highest level since
Sept. 13, as of 10:40 a.m. in Seoul, according to Korea Exchange
Inc. prices. The rate has advanced 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, in a week.  U.S. data released Oct. 31 showed a drop in jobless claims,
while a gauge of business activity jumped the most in three
decades. Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc said the Fed’s Oct. 30
policy statement opens the possibility of a reduction in
stimulus as soon as December. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
Oct. 17-18 predicted the Fed would begin paring stimulus, which
has buoyed emerging-market assets, in March.  The won fell 0.2 percent to 1,062.76 per dollar in Seoul,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate
used to price options, rose 14 basis points to 6.06 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
