A Canadian  gauge  of spending by
purchasing managers rose in October to the highest in five
months, adding to evidence of a strengthening economy.  The Ivey purchasing managers’  index  was 62.8 in October on
a seasonally adjusted basis, following a September reading of
51.9, according to a statement on the website of Western
University’s business school. Economists predicted the indicator
would measure 52.0, based on the median of 11 forecasts.
Readings of more than 50.0 show purchasing by governments and
companies advanced.  While Canada’s economy struggled to build momentum in the
first half of the year, recent indicators are suggesting it’s
accelerating. Data released by Statistics Canada Oct. 31. showed
the economy expanded at a 0.3 percent pace in August, pointing
to the fastest quarterly expansion in two years. Canadian
 consumer confidence  rose at the end of last month for the first
time in five weeks, according to the Bloomberg Nanos Canadian
Confidence Index.  The Ivey Employment Index fell to 51.7 in October from 53.5
the month before, while a gauge of inventories fell to 53.6 from
54.2 in September, according to the release.  An index of prices declined to 59.5 last month from 64,
while the supplier deliveries index rose to 52.4 from 45.3 the
month before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
