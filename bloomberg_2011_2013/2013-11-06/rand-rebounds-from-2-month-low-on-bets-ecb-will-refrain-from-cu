The rand rebounded from a two-month
low against the dollar as investors weighed the outlook for
stimulus before tomorrow’s meeting of the  European Central Bank 
and reports that may show the U.S. expansion lost momentum.  South Africa’s currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 10.2260
per dollar as of 4:01 p.m. in Johannesburg. The rand fell 1.1
percent yesterday to the weakest level since Sept. 4. Yields on
benchmark 10.5 percent bonds due December 2026 dropped three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.13 percent.  The ECB is projected to keep its main  interest rate  on
hold, while U.S. reports on growth and payroll figures may give
clues on the outlook for the  Federal Reserve ’s bond-buying
program. South African manufacturing production probably slowed
in September, a report may show tomorrow, reducing the  Reserve
Bank ’s room to stimulate the economy by cutting interest rates.  “The markets are growing increasingly cautious at the
current highs and the significant data locally and from the ECB
as well as the U.S. this week,” Mohammed Nalla, head of
strategic research at  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) , said in an e-mailed
note. Nedbank sees the rand trading between 10.15 and 10.30 per
dollar today, he said.  Manufacturing output in Africa’ biggest economy was
unchanged in September, after increasing 0.2 percent in August
the previous month, according to the median estimate of 14
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Mining production probably
rose 6.8 percent from 2.1 percent, a separate report may show
tomorrow.  Business confidence fell to 91.1 in October from 91.4 a
month earlier, the South African Chamber of Commerce and
Industry said in an e-mailed statement today. The index averaged
91.4 in first 10 months of 2013, compared with 94.4 in same
period last year, SACCI said. Foreign investors sold a net 905
million rand ($89 million) of South African  bonds  and 627
million rand of  equities  yesterday, according to JSE Ltd. data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
