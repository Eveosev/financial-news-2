Employees of  Tokyo Electric Power
Co. (9501) , the operator of the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
power plant, reduced their stake in the utility for the first
time since the atomic disaster in March 2011.  The Employees Shareholding Association, the utility’s
biggest shareholder after the government-backed Nuclear Damage
Compensation Facilitation Fund, held 47.31 million shares, or
1.33 percent, as of Sept. 30, according to data on its  website .
The association  owned  49.67 million shares six months earlier.  Among Tokyo Electric’s major shareholders, only the
employee’s association continued to increase its stake in the
company known as Tepco after meltdowns at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear plant, the company’s filings to the finance ministry
show. Tepco’s shares more than doubled in the six months ended
Sept. 30 as the company pushed to restart its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa
nuclear power plant in northern  Japan , a step the utility says
is key in its bid to return to profitability.  Tepco isn’t sure what caused the decline in holdings by the
association, said Koji Sakakibara, a Tokyo-based spokesman for
the utility. Some Tepco employees may have transferred shares
from the association to an account at a securities company for
quicker sale if needed, Sakakibara said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
