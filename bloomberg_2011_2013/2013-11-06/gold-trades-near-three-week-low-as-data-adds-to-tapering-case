Gold traded little changed after a
six-day losing run that sent prices to a near-three-week low as
data showed U.S. service industries grew faster than forecast,
boosting the case for the  Federal Reserve  to pare stimulus.  Bullion for immediate delivery was at $1,311.77 an ounce at
8:18 a.m. in  Singapore  from $1,311.81 yesterday, when bullion
retreated to $1,305.98, the lowest level since Oct. 17. The run
of six losses was the worst streak since May.  Gold lost 22 percent this year amid speculation the Fed 
would curb its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases as growth
picked up. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. non-manufacturing index rose to 55.4 in October from 54.4 the prior
month, data yesterday showed. Reports on U.S. gross domestic
product and payrolls are due Nov. 7 and Nov. 8 respectively.  “Given the recent string of better-than-expected U.S.
economic data, gold may test the $1,300 an ounce level ahead of
the payrolls report,”  James Steel , an analyst at HSBC
Securities (USA) Inc., wrote in a note. “The path of least
resistance for gold appears lower.”  GDP grew at a 2 percent annualized rate in the third
quarter after a 2.5 percent pace from April to June, according
to economists surveyed by Bloomberg before Commerce Department
figures. Payrolls probably rose by 120,000 last month after a
148,000 gain in September, Labor Department data may show.  Gold for December delivery rose as much as 0.4 percent to
$1,312.70 an ounce on the Comex in  New York  and traded at
$1,311.80. The contract dropped to $1,305.20 yesterday, the
lowest level for the most-active contract since Oct. 17.  Silver for immediate delivery was little changed at $21.684
an ounce after gaining and losing at least 0.2 percent.
Palladium rose 0.4 percent to $752.30 an ounce, while platinum
was little changed at $1,452.25 an ounce.  The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union, the
biggest union in  South Africa ’s platinum mines, has rejected pay
offers exceeding the 6 percent inflation rate, raising the
possibility of strikes. Lonmin Plc, Impala Platinum Holdings
Ltd. and Anglo American Platinum Ltd., or Amplats, are in wage
negotiations with the union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
