Gevo Inc. (GEVO) , the U.S. biofuel producer
backed by French  oil company  Total SA, tumbled the most in 13
months on production delays at its facility in Luverne,
Minnesota, and plans to raise capital.  Gevo fell 20 percent to $1.32 at the close in New York, the
most since September 2012.  The company halted production of isobutanol in Luverne in
September 2012 after contamination issues prompted the company
to adjust its manufacturing process. It resumed output on a
small scale in June and hasn’t returned to commercial-scale
operations.  “Gevo’s plant ramp-up is indeed about a quarter behind
versus what the market had been expecting,”  Pavel Molchanov , an
analyst with Raymond James & Associates Inc. in Houston, said
today in an e-mail. The Englewood, Colorado-based company said
in May it would resume commercial production this year.  The company is “likely to be raising capital” in the
fourth quarter or the first quarter of next year, Mike Willis,
Gevo’s interim chief financial officer, said on a call with
analysts yesterday.  “Gevo is starting to run low on cash, which means the
market has the added worry of dilution risk,” Molchanov said.  Gevo uses corn and plant waste to make isobutanol, a
compound that may be blended with gasoline or converted into
hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
