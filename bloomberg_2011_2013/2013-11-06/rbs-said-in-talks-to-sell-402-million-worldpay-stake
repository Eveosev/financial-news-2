Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  is
in talks to sell its minority stake in credit-card processor
WorldPay Ltd. to its private-equity co-owners, according to two
people with knowledge of the matter.  Britain’s largest publicly owned lender is negotiating with
Advent International Corp. and Bain Capital LLC to sell its
remaining holding of about 20 percent in the Cambridge, England-based company for 250 million pounds ($402 million) within the
next month, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the talks are private.  RBS sold a majority stake in WorldPay to the two Boston-based private-equity firms in a deal valued at 1.9 billion
pounds, including a 1.2 billion-pound debt package, in 2010. In
March, WorldPay’s owners increased the company’s debt, paying
themselves a 340 million-pound dividend and repaying lower-ranking debt holders.  WorldPay generated 305 million pounds of earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2012.  Officials at Edinburgh-based RBS, Bain and Advent declined
to comment. A WorldPay spokesman didn’t immediately respond to
an e-mail request seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
