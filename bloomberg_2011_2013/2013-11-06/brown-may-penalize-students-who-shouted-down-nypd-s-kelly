Brown University  will investigate and
may penalize students who disrupted a speech by  New York  Police
Commissioner Ray Kelly last month, forcing the school to cancel
the event.  Christina Paxson, Brown’s president, will appoint a faculty
and student committee to recommend how to improve planning for
such events. After the review is complete, the Providence, Rhode
Island-based school will determine whether individuals or
organizations violated a code of conduct by shouting down the
police commissioner to protest the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk policy.  “Not only was Commissioner Kelly denied the opportunity to
speak, but members of our community were denied the opportunity
to challenge him,” Paxson said in the letter today addressed to
university alumni and friends. “Many students and other
community members who strongly oppose policies and initiatives
of the  New York City Police Department  were prepared to present
their perspectives and arguments.”  Kelly, the outgoing police chief, was to set to deliver a
20-minute speech on Oct. 29 entitled “Proactive Policing in
America’s Biggest City,” followed by 40 minutes of questions
and answers. Instead the campus auditorium was cleared after
almost a half hour of shouting and interruptions that made it
impossible for the lecture to take place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
