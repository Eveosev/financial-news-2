Australia ’s top court ordered the
return of confidential client communications to Norton Rose
Fulbright’s Australian office, saying that the  law firm  that
mistakenly got them had a duty to do so.  “In the not too distant past it was understood that acting
in this way obviates unnecessary and costly” applications, the
 High Court  of Australia said today, overturning a state appeal
court decision  that  lawyers can’t reclaim rights to
confidentiality over inadvertently released documents.  Marque Lawyers, acting for a company suing Norton Rose
Fulbright’s clients, refused to return 13 documents they were
mistakenly given in 2011. It claimed that attorney-client
privilege over the communications in the documents had been
waived by being sent to them as part of court-ordered discovery
and the state appeal court agreed last year.  “In reality, there was no question of waiver sufficient to
be agitated,” the High Court said today in its  ruling . “Any
allegation of waiver was going to turn on a legal, technical
argument tangential to the main proceedings, and should not have
been made.”  Michael Bradley , managing partner at Marque, wasn’t
immediately available to comment on the ruling.  Australia’s top court, which widened the scope of
privileged documents in 1999, hasn’t addressed the issue of them
being released by mistake until now.  The case is Expense Reduction Analysts Group Pty v.
Armstrong Strategic Management and Marketing Pty. 2013/HCA46
