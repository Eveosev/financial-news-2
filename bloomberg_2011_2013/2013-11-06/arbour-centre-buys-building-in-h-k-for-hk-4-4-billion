Harbour Centre Development Ltd. (51) ,
controlled by the family of billionaire Peter Woo, bought a
former government office tower in Hong Kong’s city center for
HK$4.4 billion ($568 million) for conversion into a hotel.  The Hong Kong-based real estate company, a listed unit of
 Wheelock & Co. (20) , has until the end of 2018 to convert the 27-level, 325,073-square-foot 1960s-era Murray building into a
hotel, while preserving its exterior, according to a Hong Kong
stock exchange filing yesterday evening.  The conversion will give Harbour Centre its second hotel in
Hong Kong; it also owns the Marco Polo Hongkong Hotel in the
Tsim Sha Tsui district. The city government is  selling  some of
its older  office space  after erecting a new headquarters for
itself on the waterfront.  Woo, chairman of Wheelock, is Hong Kong’s seventh-richest
person with a fortune estimated at $7.8 billion, according to
the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He’s the son-in-law of
deceased shipping tycoon Pao Yue-Kong.  Separately,  Swire Properties Ltd. (1972)  bought a commercial site
in Hong Kong’s Kowloon Bay district from the government for
HK$2.64 billion and  Sino Land Co. (83)  bought a residential site in
the Sai Kung area for HK$850 million, according to a  statement 
posted on the government’s website yesterday. Both buyers are
Hong Kong-based real estate developers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
