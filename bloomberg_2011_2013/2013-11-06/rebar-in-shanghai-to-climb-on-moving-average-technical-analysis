Rebar prices in China may advance
about 6 percent in the next two weeks as the commodity has
breached a key moving average, according to technical analysis
by SDIC CGOG Futures Co.  Steel reinforcement-bar futures on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose above the 60-day moving average of 3,690  yuan  a
metric ton this week and are poised to soon reach 3,799 yuan,
said Fu Bocheng, a technical analyst at the Beijing-based
brokerage. Prices may then rise further to 3,848 yuan, he said.  The building material may find support at 3,670 yuan, the
61.8 percent retracement of the June 14 low of 3,382 through the
Aug. 14 high of 3,848 on Fibonacci analysis, Fu said by phone
yesterday. Support refers to levels where analysts anticipate
orders to buy may be clustered.  Rebar for May delivery, the most-active contract by volume
on the Chinese exchange, declined 0.6 percent to 3,649 yuan
($599) a ton by 11:30 a.m. local time.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast price direction.
Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise or
fall by certain percentages after reaching a new high or low.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
