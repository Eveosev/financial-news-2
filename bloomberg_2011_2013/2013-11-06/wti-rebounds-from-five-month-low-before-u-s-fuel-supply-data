West Texas Intermediate crude
rebounded from the lowest level in five months before a report
that may show U.S. fuel supplies shrank. Price declines the past
week are probably excessive, according to a technical indicator.  Futures advanced as much as 0.9 percent in  New York .
Gasoline and distillate inventories fell last week in the U.S.,
the world’s biggest oil consumer, according to a  Bloomberg News 
survey before data today from the Energy Information
Administration. Crude’s relative strength index is below 30 for
a fourth day, signaling that losses may not be sustainable.  “You tend to see a little bounce after prices have been
falling for a while,” said Thina Saltvedt, an Oslo-based
analyst at Nordea Bank, who expects  Brent crude  to stay within a
range of $105 to $106 a barrel for next two weeks. “Prices have
been quite high for the season as the market is well-supplied,
so they should now stabilize until we get more news,” she said
by phone today.  WTI for December delivery rose as much as 88 cents to
$94.25 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $93.97 at 1:33 p.m. London time. The
contract dropped $1.25 to $93.37 yesterday, the lowest close
since June 4. The volume of all futures traded was about 40
percent less than the 100-day average.  Brent for December settlement gained as much as $1.08, or 1
percent, to $106.41 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. It slid 90 cents to $105.33 yesterday, the
lowest since July 2. The European benchmark crude was at a
premium of $12 to WTI, compared with $11.96 yesterday.  Fuel Supplies  WTI has lost 5.4 percent in the past seven days. Its 14-day
relative strength index yesterday fell to 25.9, the lowest
reading since June 2012, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Futures rebounded in April from about $86 a barrel
when the chart indicator was most recently below 30.  “The price is completely oversold, and people are sort of
looking for the chance of a rebound within a few days,”  Tetsu Emori , a senior  fund manager  at Astmax Asset Management Inc. in
 Tokyo , said by phone. “We’re heading into winter, so I think
demand will be increasing. I’m not really pessimistic.”  Daily exports of North Sea Brent, Forties, Oseberg and
Ekofisk crudes, which make up the Dated Brent benchmark, will
decrease in December by 1.3 percent from November to 987,097
barrels a day, according to loading programs obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Gasoline Forecast  U.S.  gasoline  inventories probably decreased by 400,000
barrels in the week ended Nov. 1, according to the median
estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That would leave
supplies at 213.4 million, the least since November last year.
Distillate stockpiles, including heating oil and diesel, are
expected to have slid by 1.5 million barrels to 121.2 million.  Crude supplies may have expanded for a seventh week,
climbing by 2.1 million barrels to 386 million, the survey
shows. The EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical unit, is
scheduled to release its data at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute yesterday
reported an increase of 871,000 barrels in crude inventories, a
4.29 million drop in gasoline stockpiles and a 2.73 million
decline in distillates.  The U.S. will account for about 21 percent of global oil
demand this year, compared with 11 percent for  China , the
second-largest consumer, according to forecasts from the
 International Energy Agency .  To contact the reporters on this story:
