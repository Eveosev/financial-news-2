Grupo BTG Pactual,  Brazil ’s biggest
merger adviser, said third-quarter profit fell 6 percent,
missing analysts’ estimates, as revenue from principal
investments dropped.  Net income declined to 746 million reais ($326 million), or
82 centavos a share, from 793 million reais, or 90 centavos, a
year earlier, the Sao Paulo-based bank said yesterday in a
statement. The result fell short of the 88-centavo estimate of
 four  analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Principal investments, which includes private equity, real
estate and proprietary trading, posted 292 million reais of
revenue in the third quarter, according to the statement. That
compares with a loss of 313 million reais in the second quarter
and a gain of 566 million reais a year earlier.  “Markets continued to present challenges in an uncertain
environment,” Chief Executive Officer  Andre Esteves , 45, said
in the statement.  BTG shares have  slid  2 percent this year, while the
Ibovespa benchmark index declined 12 percent.  Revenue from  investment banking  fell 12 percent to 131
million reais in the third quarter from a year earlier, while
sales and trading was down 37 percent to 258 million reais,
according to the statement. The bank advised on 42 acquisitions
in Brazil this year, totaling $27.1 billion, including the
purchase of Portugal Telecom SGPS SA by Oi SA, the nation’s
biggest transaction, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Provisions for bonuses declined for a second consecutive
quarter to 121 million reais, according to the statement. The
awards are paid in a lump sum at the start of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
