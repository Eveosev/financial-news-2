CHS Inc.’s refinery in McPherson,
 Kansas , will connect a new coker to existing units next fall
during a turnaround, two people familiar with the timing of the
project said.  The new delayed coker, which the company said will allow
the refinery to run  different feedstocks  instead of expanding
throughput, will be tied in during an October 2014 maintenance
period that will include work on a number of other units, said
the people, who asked not to be identified because the
information isn’t public.  “The new delayed coker is under construction at McPherson
and is scheduled to complete in summer 2015, in keeping with the
schedule we outlined in our original announcement two years
ago,” Lani Jordan, a spokeswoman for CHS, the majority owner of
the refinery, said by e-mail yesterday.  The refinery will perform a full-plant turnaround, said one
of the people. That maintenance outage will include work on a
catalytic cracking unit, said the second person. An alkylation
unit will be shut for work at that time, said a third person who
also asked not to be identified.  The 87,500-barrel-a-day McPherson refinery planned to begin
an expansion project in Spring 2013 to boost refining capacity
to 100,000 barrels a day, CHS said in a statement in March. The
work was planned to take place  at the same time  as the coker
project and be finished in the second half of 2015 and the first
months of 2016, CHS said at the time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
