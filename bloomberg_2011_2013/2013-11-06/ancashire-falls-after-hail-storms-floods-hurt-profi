Lancashire Holdings Plc (LRE) , a Bermuda-based insurer, fell the most in three months in London trading
after third-quarter profit declined by 85 percent in the wake of
hail storms and floods in  Europe .  Net operating profit decreased to $11.2 million from $74.1
million in the three months to Sept 30, according to a statement
today. The net loss ratio, or claims as a proportion of
premiums, climbed to 56.4 percent from 14.6 percent a year
earlier as the company reported a $19.7 million net loss from
the natural catastrophes in Europe.  Lancashire’s  shares  fell as much as 3.5 percent, its
biggest intraday decline since Aug. 7 when the company sold
shares to buy Lloyd’s of  London  insurer Cathedral Capital Ltd.
It was down 2 percent to 803 pence at 10:25 a.m. in London.  “From an operating perspective we had a very average
quarter,” Elaine Whelan, Lancashire’s chief financial officer,
said in the statement. “Investment markets, unsurprisingly,
remained volatile this quarter and, while the U.S. wind season
was quiet, the industry was impacted by losses from the European
hail storms and floods.”  Hailstorms that struck  Germany  at the end of July were
estimated to have caused $2 billion in damage, while the worst
flooding in central Europe since 2002 was forecast to have
insured losses of at least 3 billion euros ($4.1 billion).  The combined ratio, or claims and expenses as a percentage
of premiums, increased to 90.8 percent in the third quarter,
from 48.9 percent, indicating a deterioration in underwriting.
Net investment income dropped 18 percent to $6.1 million.  The company declared a special dividend of 45 cents  a
common share, compared with 90 cents a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
