Indonesia ’s rupiah fell for a seventh
day, the longest losing streak since August, and bonds dropped
as U.S. economic data that topped estimates spurred bets the
 Federal Reserve  will bring forward a planned stimulus cut.  Services growth in the world’s largest economy unexpectedly
accelerated last month, beating forecasts for a slowdown, a
report showed yesterday. Indonesia’s  gross domestic product 
probably expanded 5.6 percent last quarter from a year earlier,
compared with 5.8 percent in the three months through June,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey before
data due at 11 a.m. in Jakarta today. The nation recorded trade
deficits in seven of the first nine months this year.  “The rupiah is more exposed to the rising Fed tapering
concern because of the weak external balance,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange research at Malayan Banking
Bhd. in  Singapore . “There will be an upside risk for the
currency if the GDP data proves more robust, as weaker growth
has been priced in.”  The rupiah declined 0.6 percent from Nov. 4 to 11,420 per
dollar as of 9:41 a.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks show.
It reached 11,430 earlier, the weakest level since Oct. 11.
Local markets were shut yesterday for a holiday. One-month non-deliverable forwards slid 0.8 percent to 11,360 per dollar,
trading 0.5 percent stronger than the onshore spot rate, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the contracts was set at
11,138 per dollar on Nov. 4, according to the Association of
Banks in Singapore. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose
19 basis points, or 0.19 percentage point, to 13.88 percent.  The yield on the nation’s 5.25 percent bonds due May 2018
climbed eight basis points to 7.39 percent, the highest level
since Oct. 11, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association
show. The government plans to raise 8 trillion rupiah ($701
million) from a bond auction today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
