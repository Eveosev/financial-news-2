Penn West Petroleum Ltd. (PWT) , the
Canadian energy company that cut more than 25 percent of its
workforce this year, fell the most since 2008 after saying its
turnaround strategy is expected to continue through 2014.  Penn West  declined 16 percent to C$9.74 at the close in
Toronto, the most since December 2008. The Calgary-based company
is targeting as much as C$2 billion ($1.9 billion) in asset
sales in a new plan by Chief Executive Officer  David Roberts ,
who took over in June, according to a  presentation  to investors
today. Penn West called 2014 a “critical transition year.”  “The market has just lost complete faith in this
company,” Kyle Preston, an analyst at National Bank Financial
in Calgary who  rates  the company the equivalent of a hold, said
in a phone interview today. “The strategic review process is
talking about yet another year of transition.”  Penn West forecast an underwhelming per-barrel price on
about C$485 million in asset sales this year and announced a
disappointing production target for next year, Preston said. The
company expects to get about C$38,800 per flowing barrel, which
is less than the at least C$50,000 a barrel that Preston would
have expected, he said.  The company forecast an average production target of
105,000 to 110,000 barrels a day for next year after announcing
it expects to sell assets with output of 12,500 barrels a day by
the end of 2013. Analysts had forecast prior to the announcement
that Penn West would produce the equivalent of 136,739 barrels
of oil a day in the first quarter of 2014, according to four
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Clayton Paradis, a Penn West spokesman, didn’t answer phone
calls to his office today, or respond immediately to an e-mail
message.  To contact the reporter on this story:
