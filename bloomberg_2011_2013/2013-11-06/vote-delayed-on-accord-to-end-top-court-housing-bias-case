A New Jersey town council will
postpone a vote on a proposal to settle a U.S.  Supreme Court 
case that has threatened to undercut the Obama administration’s
crackdown on lending discrimination.  The town of Mount Holly had scheduled a meeting tonight to
consider what it called a tentative settlement in the housing-bias case. The council now won’t vote tonight, James Maley, one
of the town’s lawyers in the case, said in an e-mail.  The reasons behind the delay aren’t substantive, said a
lawyer involved the case who asked not to be identified.  An accord would avert what might have been a major change
in the enforcement of the 1968 Fair Housing Act. The town has
asked the court to rule that people suing under the law must
prove intent to discriminate and not just show that a policy has
had a disproportionate effect on racial minorities.  President  Barack Obama ’s administration has repeatedly used
what are known as “disparate impact” arguments in lawsuits
against banks over housing and auto loans.  Bank of America
Corp. ,  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and  SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI)  have agreed to
pay at least $480 million to settle claims since December 2011.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has also embraced
the disparate-impact approach under a statute with similar
language, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.  The case is on the Supreme Court’s calendar for argument on
Dec. 4.  The case is Township of Mount Holly v. Mount Holly Gardens
Citizens in Action, 11-1507.  To contact the reporter on this story:
