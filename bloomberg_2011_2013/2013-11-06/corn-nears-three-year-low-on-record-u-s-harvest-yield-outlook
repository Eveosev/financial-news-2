Corn dropped for a sixth day to trade
near the lowest level in more than three years after U.S.
farmers accelerated harvesting of a record crop amid speculation
yields may be bigger than a government forecast.  The contract for December delivery lost as much as 0.2
percent to $4.2425 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and
was at $4.245 by 2 p.m. Singapore time. Prices fell to $4.24
yesterday, the cheapest since August 2010.  Corn tumbled 39 percent this year as U.S. production may
climb 28 percent to a record 13.8 billion bushels, according to
the Department of Agriculture. Yields may be 159.2 bushels per
acre, compared with the USDA’s estimate of 155.3, according to a
Bloomberg News survey. That may push output to 14.029 billion
bushels, the survey shows. The USDA is scheduled to update its
estimates on Nov. 8.  “After a slow start, the pace of the U.S. corn harvest has
surged in recent weeks,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist
at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , wrote in a report today.
“Yields have been generally stronger than expected.”  About 73 percent of the crop was  harvested  as of Nov. 3, up
from 59 percent a week earlier and above the five-year average
of 71 percent, the USDA said Nov. 4.  Wheat for December delivery gained 0.3 percent to $6.58 a
bushel, climbing for the first time in three days. Soybeans for
delivery in January added 0.2 percent to $12.525 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
