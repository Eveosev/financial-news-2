Canadian  building permits  rose less
than economists forecast in September as non-residential work
declined for the third time in four months.  The value of municipal permits rose 1.7 percent to C$6.54
billion ($6.26 billion), following a revised 20 percent drop in
August, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists
forecast a 6 percent gain according to the median of nine
responses to a Bloomberg survey.  Permits for  non-residential construction  declined 0.8
percent to C$2.48 billion, the report said. Residential permits
rose 3.3 percent to C$4.07 billion.  The Bank of Canada cut its economic growth forecast last
month and said housing will contribute little to growth as
consumers struggle with record debt burdens. Todayâ€™s report
showed the value of building permits gained 0.2 percent in
September from same month a year earlier.  Single-family housing permits rose 3.4 percent to C$2.25
billion in September and multi-unit projects such as apartments
and condominiums rose 3.3 percent to C$1.82 billion.  Municipalities approved 17,310 housing units in September,
a decline of 1.4 percent on the month and 0.8 percent from a
year earlier. The number of units approved for single-family
residences rose 5.6 percent and multiple-family project
approvals fell 5.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
