 Saferay GmbH, the German solar-farm
developer with operations on five continents, will receive as
much as $47.1 million from three public lenders to expand a
solar farm in  Chile â€™s northern Atacama desert.  The International Finance Corp. and the IFC-Canada Climate
Change Program will each provide up to $14.3 million, the
Washington-based IFC, said today in a  statement . German
development agency Deutsche Investitions und
Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH will furnish the remainder.  Saferay, based in Berlin, will use the funds to boost
capacity of its La Huayca project to 30 megawatts from 1.4
megawatts, according to the statement.  The IFC-Canada Climate Change Program is managed by the
IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, and funded by the
Canadian government, the IFC said on its  website . It was created
in 2011 to spur private-sector investment in clean-energy
projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
