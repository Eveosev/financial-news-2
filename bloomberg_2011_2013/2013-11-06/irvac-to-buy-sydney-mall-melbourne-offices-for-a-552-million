Mirvac Group (MGR) ,  Australia ’s third-biggest diversified property trust by market value, said it will
spend A$552 million ($526 million) to buy the Harbourside
Shopping Centre in Sydney and two office buildings in Melbourne.  Mirvac will acquire the shopping mall in Sydney’s Darling
Harbour on the western edge of the city center for A$252
million, the Sydney-based company said in a statement today. The
three purchases are debt funded, boosting the company’s  gearing
ratio  to 27.7 percent from 23.6 percent at the end of June, it
said. Mirvac closed 0.3 percent higher at A$1.76 in Sydney and
has  advanced  19 percent this year.  The company said in May it would focus on high-quality
offices and investment partnerships to increase returns after
writedowns in its residential development business. The Sydney
mall will increase Mirvac’s market share in the city center and
benefit in the long-term from a planned A$3 billion
redevelopment of much of the Darling Harbour precinct, the
company said in today’s statement.  “The three assets will deliver attractive returns in
excess of our stated targets,” Chief Executive Officer Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz said in the statement. “We are taking advantage
of opportunities to build our  Melbourne  CBD office portfolio.”  Mirvac expects the three properties will add to operating
earnings per share in the year ending June 30, 2014. The company
reiterated its forecast for operating earnings per share of 11.7
cents to 12.0 cents this fiscal year.  The office buildings purchased in Melbourne are at 367
Collins Street, which has a fully-let yield of 7.8 percent, and
477 Collins Street, with a fully-let yield of 7.6 percent,
Mirvac said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
