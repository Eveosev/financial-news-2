OPEC has yet to decide on
requirements for selecting a new secretary general to replace
Abdalla El-Badri, whose extended term ends this year, according
to three people familiar with OPEC policy.  The organization’s board of governors ended a meeting today
in Vienna without agreeing on the selection criteria, the people
said, asking not to be identified because discussions among the
12 member nations are private.  El-Badri, a former Libyan oil minister, served two three-year terms as secretary general before being given a one-year
extension last December. He may be asked to remain for another
12 months, the people said. A decision will be taken when the
group’s ministers meet next, on Dec. 4 in Vienna.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries comprises
Algeria, Angola,  Ecuador , Iran,  Iraq , Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria,
Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. The
two biggest producers, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, have both
submitted candidates for secretary general, as has Iran.  To contact the reporter on this story:
