Regions Financial Corp. (RF) , Alabama’s
biggest bank, received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development tied to the origination of
mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration.  The lender is cooperating with the inquiry and expects
“the outcome of pending and threatened litigation and inquiries
will not have a material effect,” the Birmingham-based company
said today in a quarterly filing.  Evelyn Mitchell , a Regions spokeswoman, declined to comment
beyond what was disclosed in the filing and HUD’s Addie
Whisenant didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed request for
comment.  Federal agencies are pursing the largest U.S. lenders for
claims tied to faulty underwriting and bias on home and auto
loans. Attorney General Eric Holder said in an interview last
month that holding banks accountable for actions that
contributed to the financial crisis are a priority for him and
President  Barack Obama .  PNC Financial Services Group Inc. disclosed in August that
it got a subpoena tied to foreclosure expenses on federally
backed home loans and said two U.S. agencies were investigating
whether its mortgages were unfairly priced. The Justice
Department told the Pittsburgh-based lender in June that it may
file a civil complaint tied to a probe into how the pricing of
mortgages affected “protected classes,” according to a filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
