The U.K. will offer an invitation-only visa program for business travelers who use those services
the most.  Membership in the so-called “Great Club” will be offered
to 100 travelers starting next year for 12 months, the  Home
Office  said in an e-mailed statement today. Each member will get
an account manager to make the process easier.  The government is also planning to widen its priority
three-to-five-day visa service to 90 countries from the current
67, as well as introducing a VIP mobile visa service for  India .  Changes to visa services services “will allow us to
maintain a world class, competitive visa system that can
innovate in order to serve the ever-changing needs of
business,” Home Secretary Theresa May said in the statement.
“We will continue to listen and respond to the needs of high-value and high-priority businesses so that we can provide them
with a service that supports economic growth.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
