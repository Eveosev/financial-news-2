The Czech koruna advanced the most in
almost two weeks as industrial output grew, curbing the case for
the central bank to sell the currency.  The koruna rose 0.2 percent, the biggest gain on a closing
basis since Oct. 24, to 25.788 per euro by 4:52 p.m. in Prague.
That pared the currency’s drop this quarter to 0.4 percent.  Industrial production expanded 7.1 percent in September
from a year earlier, the fastest pace since June 2011, the
statistics office said today, adding to signs the country’s
economic recovery is gaining momentum. The Czech National Bank
board will discuss monetary policy tomorrow, after voting
against koruna interventions at the last two meetings. Policy
makers have debated whether slowing price growth warrants the
first currency intervention since 2002.  “We expect the CNB board to reject again foreign-currency
interventions tomorrow,” Nicolaie Alexandru-Chidesciuc, an
analyst a JPMorgan Chase & Co. in  London , wrote in a report to
clients today. “The economy is showing signs of recovery” and
“this complicates a decision to start koruna sales,” he said.  September inflation slowed to 1 percent, the lowest since
2010 and below the CNB’s 2 percent target, according to data
published on Oct. 9. The central bank cut the main  interest rate 
three times last year to 0.05 percent, almost exhausting room
for traditional monetary stimulus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
