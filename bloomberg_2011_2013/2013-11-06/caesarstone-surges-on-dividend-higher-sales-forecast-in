Caesarstone Sdot Yam Ltd. (CSTE) , the
Israeli maker of quartz countertops, jumped the most in two
months after the company raised its revenue forecast for this
year and said it would pay a one-time dividend.  Shares of Caesarstone rallied 8.7 percent to $46.06 as of
12:11 p.m. in  New York , the most since Aug. 7. The stock has
gained 188 percent this year and 319 percent since its March
2012 initial public offering. The company said it will pay a
one-time  dividend  of 58 cents, its first payment on record.  The company reported revenue for the third quarter of $94.3
million, beating the $87.77 million mean estimate of three
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The Sdot Yam, Israel-based
company  expects  revenue for 2013 to increase as much as 17
percent from a year ago to $348 million.  Home prices  climbed in
88 percent of U.S. cities in the third quarter, the National
Association of Realtors said in a report today.  “Caesarstone hit a good nerve here in terms of their
exposure to the U.S. housing market,” Josef Schuster, the
founder of IPOX Schuster LLC in  Chicago , an IPO research firm,
said by phone on Nov. 6. The company benefits “from the surge
in U.S. consumer spending related to the housing market and
that’s driving the momentum right now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
