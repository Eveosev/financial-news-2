PT Lion Mentari Airlines,  Indonesia ’s
biggest carrier, plans to buy 50 aircraft from  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) 
amid a surge in travel across Asia Pacific.  Lion Air is in discussions to buy the CSeries aircraft,
Leithen Francis, the airline’s spokesman, said in an e-mail
today. The Indonesian carrier is in talks with Bombardier about
being the initial customer for the CS300 model and may announce
an order at next year’s Farnborough Air Show, Chief Executive
Officer Rusdi Kirana said in September.  From Indonesia to  Vietnam , carriers in Southeast Asia are
buying new aircraft as about 600 million people -- or the
combined population of the U.S., Germany and  Brazil  -- fly more.
Boeing Co. and Airbus SAS, the world’s two biggest planemakers,
both count on Asian airlines to buy more aircraft in the next
two decades as economic growth in the region enables more people
to take flights.  Lion Air already has 700 planes on order and expects to
have ordered 1,000 aircraft within two to three years, Kirana
said in March. The Jakarta-based carrier agreed to buy 230
Boeing 737 planes last year and ordered 234 planes from Airbus
in March.  Bombardier has said the CSeries, which features the new
geared turbofan engine from  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s Pratt &
Whitney, will cost about 15 percent less to operate, cut fuel
burn by about 20 percent and produce less noise.  At the end of September, the company had on order 177
CSeries planes from customers including Korean Air Lines Co. and
Deutsche Lufthansa AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
