SunEdison Inc. (SUNE) , the solar-plant
developer and polysilicon supplier formerly known as MEMC
Electronic Materials Inc., received 1.8 billion rand ($176
million) in financing for a project in  South Africa .  The Overseas Private Investment Corp., the U.S.
governmentâ€™s development finance institution, provided the loan
to cover 75 percent of the cost of the 2.4 billion rand project,
St. Peters, Missouri-based SunEdison said today in a statement.
The company will own 51 percent of the project, with unnamed
South Africa companies owning the remaining 49 percent.  The 60 megawatt Boshof Solar Park Project, located in the
Free State province near Kimberley, will sell power to state
utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. under a 20-year contract once
operational in the fourth quarter of 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
