Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat
vowed to reach his government’s 2013 budget-deficit target of
2.7 percent of gross domestic project even as the European
Commission sees the shortfall widening to 3.4 percent of GDP.  Muscat said the  commission’s forecast , published yesterday,
resulted from its experience of dealing with the previous
government in Valletta that “didn’t live up to expectations.”  “I believe that discussions with the European Commission
will be positive, with Brussels realizing we are a government
which implements what it promises,” Muscat, elected in March,
told reporters in the Maltese capital today.  According to the commission, the Maltese economy will
expand 1.8 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2014. Muscat
noted that while the Maltese opposition has criticized him for
failing to spur job creation, the commission forecasts
employment growth of 2.3 percent this year and 1.8 percent in
2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
