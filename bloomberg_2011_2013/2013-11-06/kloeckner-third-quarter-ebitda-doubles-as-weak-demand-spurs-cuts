Kloeckner & Co SE (KCO)  said earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the
third quarter doubled, beating analyst estimates, as the German
steel trader cut costs amid weak industry demand in Europe.  Ebitda grew to 36 million euros ($48.6 million) from 18
million euros a year earlier, the Duisburg, Germany-based
company, part owned by the Knauf family, said today in a
statement. That compares with the 34.7 million-euro average of
ten analyst estimates, compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 14
percent to 1.6 billion euros.  “The third quarter shows that we have made the turnaround
by own means, bucking the market trend,” Chief Executive
Officer Gisbert Ruehl said in the statement. “For the first
time this year and despite the ongoing steel crisis in  Europe ”
operating income has surged from a year earlier, he said.  Weak demand from automakers and builders in Europe and
competition from  China  have cut steel prices and squeezed profit
margins as producers grapple with surplus capacity. ThyssenKrupp
AG and Salzgitter AG, Germany’s largest steelmakers, have said
they will cut a combined 2,800 jobs until 2018.  Kloeckner reiterated a 2013 Ebitda forecast of 140 million
euros, after lowering it in August from 200 million euros. The
company’s third-quarter net loss narrowed to 11 million euros
from 28 million euros a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
