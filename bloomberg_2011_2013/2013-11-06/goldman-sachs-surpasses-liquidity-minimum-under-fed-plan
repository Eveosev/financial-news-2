Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s liquidity
coverage ratio, a measure of its ability to survive a credit-market freeze, surpasses the minimum proposed by the  Federal
Reserve  last month, said Treasurer Liz Beshel Robinson.  Goldman Sachs would top the minimum even under the Fed’s
proposed stricter guidelines and therefore wouldn’t be affected
by a shorter timeline than international banks may face,
Robinson said today on a conference-call with fixed-income
investors.  The Fed last month proposed rules to require the biggest
banks to hold 30 days of easy-to-sell assets to make the
companies safer in the event of a credit crisis like the one in
2008. The plan had a shorter timeline than non-U.S. banks will
face and was more restrictive in what U.S. banks can include
among their assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
