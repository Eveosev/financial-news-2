PDG Realty SA (PDGR3) ,  Brazil ’s second-biggest homebuilder by revenue, dropped the most in 16 months
after reporting a wider-than-forecast quarterly loss amid a
surge in order cancellations.  Shares  slumped  8.9 percent to 1.85 reais at the close in
Sao Paulo, the biggest one-day drop since July 2012. Trading
volume was twice the daily average of the past three months. The
homebuilder’s slide contributed the most to the Ibovespa
benchmark’s 0.8 percent  decline .  PDG took the initiative in June and July to cancel orders
from customers who couldn’t pay or qualify for financing,
according to Marco Kheirallah, the homebuilder’s chief financial
officer. “That’s why cancellations peaked in the third
quarter,” Kheirallah said in a phone interview. “This number
will fall in the fourth quarter.”  The company’s third-quarter cancellations rose to 50
percent of contracted sales from 26 percent in the first half of
this year, according to a regulatory filing after the market
closed yesterday.  The company posted an adjusted net loss of 84.8 million
reais ($37.1 million) in the three months through September,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average estimate of
six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a loss of 53.8
million reais.  PDG will reverse losses and post profit next year,
Kheirallah said. “The company will deliver more projects in
2014 than in 2013,” he said. “And we’ll only start new
projects that are profitable. We’re not focused on growth but on
profitability now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
