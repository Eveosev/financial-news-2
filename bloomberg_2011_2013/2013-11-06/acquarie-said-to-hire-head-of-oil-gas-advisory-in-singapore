Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)  hired John
Malhotra as a managing director in its advisory and capital-raising unit’s oil and gas team, according to a person with
knowledge of the appointment.  Malhotra joined  Macquarie Capital  in mid-October in London
and will move to Singapore this month to lead the Asian oil and
gas advisory business, the person said, asking not to be
identified because the information is confidential.  Prior to joining Macquarie, Malhotra was an independent
energy adviser. He has also held positions at HSBC Holdings Plc
and Lazard Ltd. in London, the person said. The  Wall Street
Journal  reported the appointment earlier. A second person, who
answered a call at Macquarie’s London office today, said
Malhotra was not immediately available to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
