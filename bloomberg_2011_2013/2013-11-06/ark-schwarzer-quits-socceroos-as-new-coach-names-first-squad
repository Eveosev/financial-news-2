Goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer quit
international soccer as Australia’s most-capped player hours
before new coach Ange Postecoglou named his first squad.  The 41-year-old Schwarzer, who played 109 games for the
Socceroos since 1993, notified Football Federation Australia of
his decision after he was originally selected for a Nov. 19
exhibition game against  Costa Rica .  “Mark was included in this squad, but decided that he
wanted to announce his retirement,” Postecoglou said today in a
televised news conference. “I’ve the utmost respect firstly for
his decision, which was his, and secondly it would be remiss of
me to not pay tribute to him. He’s no doubt one of the all-time
greats for the Socceroos.”  Schwarzer’s retirement, which follows his move from
starting goalkeeper at Fulham to Petr Cech’s back-up at Premier
League rival Chelsea, opens the way for Mitchell Langerak and
Mat Ryan to fight it out for the Socceroos’ No. 1 spot ahead of
next year’s  World Cup  in  Brazil .  They were the only goalkeepers in the 22-man squad to face
Costa Rica announced today. Postecoglou, who was hired as coach
on a five-year contract on Oct. 23, called up South Korea-based
defender Alex Wilkinson as the only rookie in his first roster.  SOCCEROOS SQUAD: Oliver Bozanic, Mark Bresciano,  Tim Cahill ,
Jason Davidson, Ivan Franjic, James Holland, Mile Jedinak, Josh
Kennedy, Robbie Kruse, Mitchell Langerak, Matthew Leckie, Ryan
McGowan, Matthew McKay, Mark Milligan,  Lucas Neill , Tommy Oar,
Tom Rogic, Mat Ryan, Dario Vidosic, Rhys Williams, Alex
Wilkinson, Michael Zullo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
