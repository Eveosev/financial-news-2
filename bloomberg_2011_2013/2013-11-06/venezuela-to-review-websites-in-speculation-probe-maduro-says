Venezuelan President  Nicolas Maduro 
said his government will review three websites including
MercadoLibre.com as part of government efforts to combat price
and currency speculation.  Maduro also named TuCarro.com and TuInmueble.com, which
sell cars and real estate, respectively as websites that will be
subject to review by the government. Telephone calls made after
business hours by  Bloomberg News  to the three companies seeking
comment were unanswered.  “The people that manage these websites in  Venezuela  will
be summoned immediately so they can explain how they set
speculative and false prices that rob our Venezuela,” Maduro
said in a national address broadcast on radio and television.  Venezuela will reorder its economic policies, mechanisms
and agencies to stabilize currency, prices, production and
supply of goods, Maduro said earlier, without providing further
information. Venezuela will create a National Foreign Trade
Center to manage foreign currency and import policies, he said.  Shares of  MercadoLibre Inc. (MELI) , operates an online trading
site for the Latin American markets, fell for a second day,
declining 10 percent to $120.48. The company yesterday reported
third-quarter earnings per share of 66 cents, below the 72 cent
media estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
