Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields down the most in about two months, after a surprise drop
in consumer prices in October fueled speculation that the
central bank has room to cut borrowing costs further.  Yields on securities maturing in October 2015 fell 12 basis
points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 4.61 percent at 11:29 a.m.
in Bogota, according to data from the central bank. The price
rose 0.23 centavo to 106.26 centavos per peso.  Consumer prices fell 0.26 percent in October, led by a 1
percent decline in food prices, the national statistics agency
said in a report yesterday after the close of markets. The
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a
0.13 percent increase.  Annual inflation  slowed to 1.84 percent,
the lowest rate since February.  “The surprise was huge so you obviously have a clear
reaction in the market,”  Camilo Perez , the head analyst at
 Banco de Bogota SA (BOGOTA) , said in a telephone interview. “Some are
starting to see the possibility of another rate cut.” The bank
joined Credicorp Capital in predicting a decline in consumer
prices while 26 other firms forecast an increase.  The central bank lowered the  overnight lending rate  from
July 2012 through March to 3.25 percent from 5.25 percent to
push inflation back up to the 2 percent target.  As economic growth accelerates, Perez forecasts policy
makers will leave borrowing costs unchanged until March, when he
expects a rate increase.  The peso climbed less than 0.1 percent to 1,918.31 per
dollar today after four days of declines. It has fallen 1.4
percent in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
