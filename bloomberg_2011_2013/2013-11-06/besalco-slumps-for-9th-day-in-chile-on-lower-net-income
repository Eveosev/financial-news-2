Besalco SA (BESALCO) ,  Chile ’s largest builder
by market value, declined for a ninth straight day in its
longest losing streak in two years after reporting last week
profits that trailed analysts estimates.  The shares fell 7.3 percent to 612 pesos at the close in
Santiago, extending its loss since Oct. 22 to 21 percent. The
IPSA stock index fell 0.5 percent.  Besalco reported Oct. 30 in a  filing  that its profit in the
third quarter fell 63 percent from a year earlier to 1.51
billion pesos ($2.9 million). Euroamerica Corredores de Bolsa SA
had forecast a decline of 12 percent.  “The market expected lower profits, but the final numbers
were a lot lower than forecast and that keeps pressuring the
shares,” Jorge Sepulveda, an analyst at Euroamerica, said today
in a phone interview.  Luis Alfredo Ramos, an analyst at Santiago-based brokerage
Larrain Vial SA Corredora de Bolsa, cut today the firm’s
recommendation for Besalco to sell from buy and set a price
target of 700 pesos, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
