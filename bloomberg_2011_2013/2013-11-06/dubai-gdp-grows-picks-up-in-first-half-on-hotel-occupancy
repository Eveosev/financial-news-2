Dubai’s economy expanded 4.9 percent
in the first half of 2013, led by the hotel and restaurant
industry, as the  Middle East ’s financial and transport hub
rebounds from its debt crisis.  Gross domestic product expanded to 169 billion dirhams ($46
billion), the statistics office said in an e-mailed statement
today. Growth quickened from a 4 percent pace in the first half
of 2012. The hotels and restaurants industry grew 14 percent,
while manufacturing expanded 13 percent.  Dubai’s economy is rebounding four years after the second-biggest sheikhdom in the  United Arab Emirates  teetered on the
brink of default. The benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  surged 79
percent this year, making it the best performer among the 50
biggest equity markets globally.  “Growth was across most of the sectors and economic
activities,” Arif Almuhairi, executive director of the
statistics office, said in the statement.  Wholesale, retail and maintenance services expanded 4.1
percent and contributed with 29 percent to the emirate’s
economy. Business services and real estate, at the heart of
Dubai’s debt crisis, grew 3.3 percent. Electricity, gas and
water grew 4.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
