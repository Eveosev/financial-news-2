Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. (CF) ,
Canada’s largest non-bank brokerage by assets, said losses
narrowed in the fiscal second quarter on lower costs and
improvements in its capital markets businesses outside Canada.  The net loss for the period ended Sept. 30 was C$80,000
($76,800), or 3 cents a share, compared with C$14.8 million, or
19 cents, a year earlier, the Toronto-based firm said today in a
statement. Revenue fell 1.8 percent to C$183.3 million from the
year-earlier period and expenses declined 10 percent to C$184.3
million.  Canaccord benefited from higher capital markets revenue
from the U.S., U.K. and Europe, offsetting a decline from its
Canadian operations. The brokerage had C$5.5 million in costs
from restructuring its sales and trading operations in  Canada ,
the U.K. and Europe, as well as some office closures.  “Challenging markets impacted our Canadian business units,
while our U.S. and U.K. businesses posted sequentially strong
performances,” Chief Executive Officer Paul Reynolds, 50, said
in a conference call after earnings. “We believe the overall
industry slowdown is behind us as we’re beginning to see signs
of a market resurgence across all our geographies.”  Earnings excluding some items were 3 cents a share,
according to the statement, missing the 10-cent average  estimate 
of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Canaccord  rose  2.6 percent to C$6.71 at 3:59 p.m. in
Toronto. The shares have gained 0.2 percent this year, trailing
the 7.6 percent  advance  of the benchmark Standard & Poor’s/TSX
Composite Index.  The company changed its name from Canaccord Financial Inc.
