Joy Johnson, the oldest woman to
finish this year’s  New York  City Marathon at the age of 86, died
after completing her 25th race, the New York Daily News reported.  Johnson, of  San Jose ,  California , fell and hit her head on
the road at the 20th mile of the Nov. 3 race, the newspaper said,
citing her 83-year-old sister Faith Anderson, who accompanied
her on the trip to New York.  Johnson turned down medics who wanted to take her to the
hospital, saying she would complete the last five miles of the
course, the Daily News said. She crossed the finish line in
about eight hours.  Johnson did her annual post-marathon interview with the
“Today” show on NBC the following day and went back to her
hotel room to take a nap. She never awoke, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
