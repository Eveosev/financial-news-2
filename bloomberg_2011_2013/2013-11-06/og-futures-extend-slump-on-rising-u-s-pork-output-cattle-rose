Hog futures fell for the seventh
consecutive session, extending the longest slump since February,
on signs that U.S. pork processors are increasing output. Cattle
prices climbed.  Meatpackers processed 870,000 hogs in the first two days of
this week, 1.2 percent more than a week earlier, U.S. Department
of Agriculture data show. The average carcass  weight  is up 4.3
pounds (1.9 kilograms) from the same period a year earlier as
plunging feed costs allows farmers to keep animals longer,
according to the USDA. Wholesale-pork prices are down 16 percent
from this year’s high on June 26.  “You are going to have producers push these hogs to
maximum weights,” Chad Henderson, a market analyst with Prime
Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in
a telephone interview. “Demand is consistent, but demand is not
strong.”  Hog futures for December settlement fell 0.8 percent to
87.5 cents a pound at 10:15 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after touching 87.25 cents, the lowest for a most-active contract since Oct. 18. Prices are down 4.8 percent over
the past seven sessions, the longest slump since Feb. 22.  Cattle futures for December delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$1.32175 a pound on the CME, after fluctuating between gains and
losses. Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement increased
0.4 percent to $1.657 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
