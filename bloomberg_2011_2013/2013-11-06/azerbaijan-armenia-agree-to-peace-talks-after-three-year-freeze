Azerbaijan  and  Armenia  agreed to hold
talks over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh for the
first time since a diplomatic push by the U.S., Russia and
France ended in deadlock three years ago.  Azeri President  Ilham Aliyev , re-elected last month with 85
percent of the vote, and his Armenian counterpart, Serzh Sargsyan, agreed to meet this month, U.S., French and Russian
officials said in a joint statement e-mailed late yesterday. The
date and place of the summit are still being worked out.  Armenia seized Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous enclave
about the size of Rhode Island with more than 140,000 people,
and seven adjacent districts from Azerbaijan after the Soviet
Union’s collapse in 1991. More than 30,000 people were killed
and more than 1 million displaced before Russia brokered a
cease-fire in May 1994.  The U.S., France and Russia “call upon all sides to
exercise restraint on the ground as well as in their public
statements,” the diplomats, who lead the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe’s peace efforts for Nagorno-Karabakh, said in the statement. “Military action, particularly
at this moment, can only be seen as an attempt to damage the
 peace process .”  Azerbaijan, buoyed by the third-largest oil reserves in the
former  Soviet Union , has increased military spending almost 30-fold to $3.7 billion in the past decade. Aliyev has repeatedly
threatened to use force to regain the disputed territory if
peace talks fail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
