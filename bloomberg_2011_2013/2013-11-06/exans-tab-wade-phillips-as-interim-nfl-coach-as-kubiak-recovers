The Houston Texans said defensive
coordinator  Wade Phillips  will be their interim coach while  Gary Kubiak  recovers from a mini-stroke.  The Texans, who visit the Arizona Cardinals this week, said
it hasn’t been determined when Kubiak can resume his coaching
duties.  Kubiak, 52, was released from a Houston hospital yesterday
and the team said he’s expected to make a full recovery from a
transient ischemic attack that led to his collapse during
halftime of the Texans’ game against Indianapolis on Nov. 3.
Such an attack occurs when the blood flowing to the brain is
interrupted, usually by a narrowing of the vessels or a clot,
according to the Mayo Clinic  website .  Phillips, 66, has been a head coach for five National
Football League teams, most recently going 34-22 with the Dallas
Cowboys from 2007 to 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
