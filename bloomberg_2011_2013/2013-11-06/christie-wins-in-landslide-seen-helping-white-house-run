New Jersey  Governor  Chris Christie  trounced his Democratic opponent to win a second term and bragging rights as a potential 2016 Republican candidate for U.S. president who can appeal across party lines.  Christie, 51, received 61 percent of the vote yesterday compared to 38 percent for state Senator  Barbara Buono , with 99 percent of precincts counted, according to the Associated Press. He is the first Republican candidate for New Jersey governor to collect more than 60 percent of the vote since Tom Kean in 1985.  The incumbent won over Democrats and independent voters with his leadership after Hurricane Sandy struck in October 2012. The rout makes him a stronger contender for president, said  Julian Zelizer , who teaches history and public affairs at Princeton University. Christie’s challenge now is turning around the state’s laggard economy, which disappoints New Jerseyans in polls and threatens his national standing, Zelizer said.  “The inability to really generate economic activity may leave a bad mark on his reputation,” Zelizer said. “That’s where he puts all his emphasis in the next few years.”  In 2011, Christie turned down appeals from Republican leaders and donors, including  Home Depot Inc.  co-founder  Kenneth G. Langone , to take on Democrat  Barack Obama  in 2012. During this year’s campaign, the governor said his focus was on a second term, not a 2016 run, though he didn’t rule it out.  Women Approve  During his victory speech last night, Christie took several shots at politicians in Washington, saying they could learn from his success getting things done.  “Tonight a dispirited America angry with their dysfunctional government in Washington will be looking at New Jersey and saying, ‘Is what I think is happening really happening?’” he said. “Are people actually coming together?”  In a Nov. 4 Quinnipiac University poll of likely New Jersey voters, 60 percent of women had a favorable opinion of Christie, which “might be unheard-of for a Republican officeholder,” said  Maurice Carroll , director of the Hamden, Connecticut, school’s poll. It also showed 94 percent of Republicans, 64 percent of independents and 30 percent of Democrats backed the governor.  Christie praised Obama’s response to Sandy ahead of last year’s Election Day, angering some in his party who blamed him for Republican challenger  Mitt Romney ’s loss. In January, Christie attacked Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives for delaying a vote on disaster aid.  Republican Party  During last month’s partial government shutdown, which was driven by the Republican Tea Party faction in Congress, Christie criticized Obama and lawmakers from both parties.  “If the Republican Party is torn between the Tea Party and those who want it to move toward the middle, Christie would be that candidate, at least right now,” said  Krista Jenkins , director of the PublicMind poll at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison, New Jersey.  In a Rutgers-Eagleton poll released Oct. 23, 85 percent of respondents approved of his post-Sandy work. Yet on their biggest concerns, the economy and jobs, his rating fell to 42 percent, and on taxes, it dropped to 38 percent.  “He wants to be able to communicate to a primary electorate in 2016 that the central issues that dominate the campaign he was able to handle in his home state,” Jenkins said.  ‘Very Competitive’  Speaking to the Republican National Committee in August, Christie made the case that his success in a Democrat-dominated state offers lessons for his party at the national level. In surveys leading up to his re-election, he attracted support from independents, women and minority voters -- all potential linchpins to winning the White House.  “I think Chris Christie can be very competitive here, if he chooses to run,” A.J. Spiker, chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, said in an Oct. 25 interview. “From what I hear from people, even if they disagree with Chris Christie on a lot of issues, they do like that he’s a very blunt, vocal person who doesn’t hold back.”  Christie “could easily become our nominee and save our party,” Romney said Nov. 3 on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”  Senator Booker  Buono, 60, a lawyer from Metuchen, emerged as her party’s choice to take on Christie after more popular Democrats, including  Cory Booker , chose not to challenge him. Booker, the former mayor of Newark, New Jersey’s biggest city, ran instead in last month’s special election to fill the opening left by the June death of U.S. Senator  Frank Lautenberg , an 89-year-old Democrat. Booker, 44, won and took office on Oct. 31.  Sandy, the largest Atlantic storm in history, devastated New Jersey’s 127-mile (200 kilometer) coastline, damaging 346,000 homes. A month before it hit, surveys showed New Jersey voters were split on whether Christie deserved a second term, and Booker’s popularity gaining. The storm propelled Christie into daily televised recovery briefings, surveying damage with Obama and hugging victims amid the ruins.  During the campaign, Buono portrayed herself as empathetic to the poor and middle class, having worked to put herself through college and law school and for a time relying on food stamps. She called Christie a favorite of the rich and an enemy of women and gays, though the message was dwarfed by his political celebrity and cash advantage.  “Buono gave it a good New Jersey try, but she wasn’t stronger than the ‘Christie Storm,’” Carroll said on Nov. 4.  Jersey Politics  The incumbent was declared the winner by the Associated Press and CNN moments after polls closed, drawing cheers from the crowd of Christie supporters at the Asbury Park Convention Hall. Buono conceded less than an hour later.  Buono told supporters at a Metuchen restaurant that the race was about people “who wanted nothing more than a shot,” a population of women, gays, immigrants and the unemployed whom Christie’s policies had bypassed.  “We took on the bosses and the political machines that have defined New Jersey politics for far too long,” she said.  Christie raised $13.2 million for the campaign, more than four times Buono’s $2.8 million, according to the state Election Law Enforcement Commission.  During an Oct. 25 interview, Christie said the duties of the race and governing left him no time to think about 2016.  “I’m not stupid; I know it’s out there but I’ve got to tell you I don’t even have the capacity to focus on it right now if I wanted to,” he said.  Lieutenant Governor  A win gives Christie the governor’s job through January 2018. If he runs and is elected president in 2016, he would enter the White House in January 2017. The rigors of a national campaign and federal campaign-finance laws may force him to step down in Trenton even earlier, putting the state in the hands of his lieutenant,  Kim Guadagno , who was unknown to more than 70 percent of voters in recent surveys.  Assemblywoman  Bonnie Watson Coleman , a Democrat from Ewing watching the election returns at the Buono event, said New Jerseyans will come to regret their choice of Christie.  “He’ll be gone in 30 seconds if he thinks it’s to his advantage to run for president,” she said. In his place, she said, he will leave Guadagno, “and we have no idea who she is.”  Before the election, some Democrats said they were worried that votes for Christie would trickle down the ballot, where all 120 seats of the legislature were up for grabs. Democrats retained control of both chambers, the Star-Ledger reported.  Blue State  Christie becomes the first New Jersey governor re-elected since Republican  Christine Todd Whitman  in 1997. That year was also the last time before Christie that a Republican was elected New Jersey governor.  State voters have backed Democrats for president since 1992. Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 700,000, while the 2.6 million independents top members of both parties.  Democrats controlled New Jersey’s governor’s office from 2001 to 2009, when Christie ousted  Jon Corzine  after voters rejected the incumbent’s handling of the recession. Christie took office in January 2010, pledging to cut taxes and add jobs.  New Jersey has added 142,400 nongovernment jobs since February 2010, Christie’s first full month in office. That’s 59 percent of the jobs lost during the recession that began in December 2007. Neighboring New York had gained back all of the jobs it lost during that period by last year.  Under Christie, unemployment  fell  to 8.5 percent in August from 9.7 percent in February 2010. That’s 1.2 percentage points higher than the  U.S. average  for August, and tied for the seventh-highest among the 50 states. New York’s August jobless rate was 7.6 percent and Pennsylvania’s was 7.7 percent.
