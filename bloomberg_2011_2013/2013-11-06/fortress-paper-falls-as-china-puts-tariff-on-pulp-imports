Fortress Paper Ltd. (FTP) , a wood-pulp
producer with mills in  Quebec , fell the most in five months
after saying China imposed anti-dumping  import duties  on
shipments of specialty wood from  Canada .  Fortress fell 13 percent to C$4.89 at 1:58 p.m. in Toronto
after earlier dropping as much as 14 percent, the most intraday
since May 14. The shares are down 39 percent this year.  China’s Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, imposed a
preliminary 13 percent duty on imports of dissolving pulp from
producers in Canada, pending a final determination on the
tariff, North Vancouver-based Fortress said today in a
statement.  Fortress “is disappointed by MOFCOM’s preliminary
decision, and believes that the decision represents an
unsupported assessment of injury to China’s dissolving pulp
market and the allegations of ‘dumping’ activities by Canadian
producers,” the company said in the statement.  Fortress is considering a legal challenge and may request a
public hearing, according to the statement.  Dissolving pulp is used to make products such as cigarette
filters and synthetic fabrics including rayon. It’s named as
such because the pulp is dissolved in chemicals before being
used in manufacturing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
