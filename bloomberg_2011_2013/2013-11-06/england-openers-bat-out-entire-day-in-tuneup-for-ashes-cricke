Captain  Alastair Cook  and opening
partner Michael Carberry batted out the first day to lead
England to 318 without loss in its Ashes cricket tuneup against
Australia’s second-string team.  Cook finished day one at Hobart’s Bellerive Oval on 154 not
out, with fellow left-hander Carberry unbeaten on 153 as he
tries to win a spot in the batting order for the best-of-five
contest against Australia starting Nov. 21 in Brisbane.  Cook’s 272-ball innings came after he missed England’s
tour-opening draw against a Western Australia Chairman’s XI in
Perth because of a sore back.  England, which has won the past three Ashes series, has
three days remaining against Australia A in the Tasmanian
capital and another four-day match against a New South Wales XI
in Sydney before facing  Australia .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
