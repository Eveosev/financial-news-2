Gasoline rose for the first time in
five days as the Energy Information Administration reported that
inventories of the motor fuel fell last week.  Futures gained as  stockpiles  in the week ended Nov. 1
declined 3.76 million barrels to 210 million, more than the
400,000-barrel drop projected in a survey by Bloomberg. The
supply withdrawal came as refiners reduced operating rates and
as  demand  jumped to the highest since July.  “There was a big draw in gasoline despite the fact
refiners increased runs,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market
analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “  Gasoline for December delivery advanced 4.01 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $2.5562 a gallon at 1:17 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume on all contracts was 58
percent higher than the 100-day average.  Futures touched $2.5138 yesterday and settled at the lowest
level since December 2011 amid speculation that stockpile
declines will ease as refiners return from seasonal maintenance.  ‘‘The drop in both gasoline and distillate stocks was
pretty bullish,’’ said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . ‘‘At two-and-a-half
dollars, unless the economy is going to hell in a hand basket,
it seems you’ve have support at that level.’’  East Coast  Gasoline stocks in PADD 1, which includes  New York  Harbor,
the delivery point for the Nymex contract, fell 2.04 million
barrels to 54 million, the biggest decline in 11 weeks. Imports
to the region slipped 13 percent to 450,000 barrels a day.  Refinery input  of crude and feedstocks last week fell
85,000 barrels a day to 15.5 million.  Demand, or deliveries to wholesalers from blenders and
refiners, jumped 2.6 percent to 9.29 million barrels a day, the
most since July 5. The four-week average was 5.4 percent above a
year earlier when East Coast production, distribution and demand
was disrupted by  Hurricane Sandy .  ‘‘There were some refinery issues that were part of the
decline in gasoline production,’’ Flynn said. ‘‘There was also
some demand response last week as some people for the first time
were able to get gasoline for less than $3 a gallon,’’  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI narrowed 8 cents to
$12.23 a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  versus Brent increased $1.31
to $1.66.  Pump Prices  U.S.  pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.8 cent to
$3.232 a gallon, the lowest level since Dec. 20, Heathrow,
Florida-based AAA said today on its website. Prices are 23.1
cents below a year ago.  Supplies of distillates , including diesel and jet fuel,
fell 4.9 million barrels to 117.8 million, the lowest in six
months. Analysts estimates a 1.5-million-barrel drop.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for December delivery rose 1.7
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.8811 a gallon, after settling
yesterday at the lowest since June 26. Volume was 23 percent
below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  premium  over WTI fell $1.04 to $25.88 a barrel. The 
spread  versus Brent widened 38 cents to $15.34.  To contact the reporter on this story:
