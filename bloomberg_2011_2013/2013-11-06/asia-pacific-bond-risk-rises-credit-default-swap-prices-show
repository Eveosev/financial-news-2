The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in Asia-Pacific against non-payment rose,
according to traders of credit default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  advanced 2 basis points to 139 basis
points as of 8:10 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge, which has ranged from
99.5 to 177.8 basis points this year, is on track for its
highest close since Oct. 14, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased 2 basis points
to 106 as of 11:20 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp. prices
show. The benchmark is poised for its biggest one-day rise since
Sept. 30, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose by 0.5 of a basis point
to 94.75 basis points as of 9:12 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Citigroup Inc. prices. The gauge, which has ranged from 74 to
148.1 basis points this year, increased 7.3 basis points last
week, the most since the five days ending July 26, CMA data
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
