Texas voters passed a water measure
that allows a state enduring drought and supply woes as the
population grows to put $2 billion of reserves into a fund to
help pay for reservoirs and related public infrastructure works.  Governor  Rick Perry  had endorsed Proposition 6, which also
won the backing of environmental groups and business
ogranizations. Voters in yesterday’s referendum approved by a
73-27 percent margin the transfer of state savings from “rainy
day” reserves to a water infrastructure fund that would allow
public authorities to finance projects with low-cost loans
including pipeline upgrades without raising taxes.  “Today, the people of Texas made history, ensuring we’ll
have the water we need to grow and thrive for the next five
decades without raising state taxes,” Perry said in a statement
last night. “Now it’s time to get to work on the projects
that’ll help us meet our growing water needs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
