Mexican policy makers cut their
growth forecast for this year in half after stagnant exports and
a flagging construction industry led them to reduce interest
rates by the most since the 2009 recession.  Gross domestic product  will expand 0.9 percent to 1.4
percent this year compared with the 2 percent to 3 percent
previously forecast, the central bank said in its quarterly
inflation report published today. In 2014, the economy will grow
3 percent to 4 percent, down from the 3.2 percent to 4.2 percent
previously estimated. The bank raised its inflation estimate for
next year to 3.5 percent from near 3 percent after Congress
passed new levies on junk food and sugary drinks.  A drop in public spending and the devastation from twin
hurricanes in September have slowed industrial output and
domestic demand more than expected by economists, who now say
GDP will grow by a third the rate of 2012. Central bank Governor
Agustin Carstens has cut the overnight rate three times this
year by a total of 1 percentage point to a record low.  Analysts polled by Banxico forecast 2013 growth of 1.24
percent after a 3.9 percent expansion last year as industrial
production contracted 0.6 percent in the second quarter and
retail sales shrank unexpectedly in two of the past three
months. Industrial output continued to fall in July and August,
dropping 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent respectively, and the
government estimates growth slowed to 1 percent in the third
quarter from 1.5 percent in the previous three months.  Economists also lowered their 2014 growth estimate in
Banxico’s Nov. 1 survey to 3.41 percent from 3.59 percent.  Rate Outlook  Carstens said in an Oct. 30 interview that the central bank
shouldn’t cut the key interest rate any lower than the current
3.5 percent as the tax increases give a temporary boost to
inflation.  Inflation has slowed in each of the past five months to
3.39 percent in September. The rate dropped to 3.33 percent in
October, according to the median estimate of analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. The national statistics agency will publish
the October results tomorrow.  Mexico ’s Congress passed a new 8 percent tax on junk food
and a 1 peso-per-liter duty on sugary drinks and raised sales
taxes at the border to 16 percent from 11 percent. The same day,
Congress passed a 1.5 percent deficit as part of the revenue
portion of next year’s budget.  “The revenue law approved in the Senate will have a
relatively small and temporary impact on inflation,” Carstens
told reporters yesterday.  Banco de Mexico reduced the overnight lending rate by 25
basis points on Oct. 24 and Sept. 6 and by a half point in
March. Previous to that, the bank hadn’t touched rates since
slashing them 3.75 percentage points in 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
