Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures swung
between gains and losses after benchmark indexes dropped by the
most in more than five weeks yesterday.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for November delivery fell 0.2
percent to 6,277 at 10 a.m. in Singapore after adding as much as
0.3 percent. The underlying CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index lost 1 percent to
6,253.15 yesterday, the biggest drop since Sept. 30. The S&P BSE
Sensex declined 1.3 percent, the first loss in six days. The
Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares
slid 0.9 percent.  International investors were  net purchasers  of Indian
stocks for the 21st consecutive day on Nov. 1, the longest
buying streak since May, according to data from the market
regulator. Foreign funds bought $4.92 billion of the nation’s
shares in the two months through Oct. 31, helping drive a 14
percent rebound in the Sensex.  “Overseas fund inflows will continue to support the
markets, but we expect some consolidation after a sharp rally,”
Supreeth Shankarghal, Bangalore-based chief executive officer at
Quant First Asset Advisors India, which manages about $100
million in options, said by phone. “This will happen as some
investors went gung-ho without much reason.”  Foreign investors have bought a net $16.4 billion of Indian
stocks this year, the biggest inflow after  Japan  among 10 Asian
markets tracked by Bloomberg.  Power equipment maker  Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL)  may
report today profit of 8.05 billion rupees ($131 million) for
the quarter ended Sept. 30, according to the median estimate of
38 analysts.  Net incomes at 16 of the 19 companies in the Sensex that
have posted results so far exceeded analyst estimates, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. About 47 percent of the 30
companies in the index missed forecasts in the previous quarter.  The Sensex has risen 8 percent this year, the biggest gain
among the four-largest  emerging markets , and  trades  at 13.9
times projected 12-month profits, in line with its five-year
average. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is valued at 10.6 times
forecast earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
