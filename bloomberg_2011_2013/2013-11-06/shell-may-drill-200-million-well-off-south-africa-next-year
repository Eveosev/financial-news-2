Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Europe ’s
largest oil producer, may drill off South Africa’s northwest
coast next year after studying geological data from the area.  The company based in The Hague, acquired 8,000 square
kilometers (3,088 square miles) of 3-D seismic data of the
Orange Basin, Shell South Africa General Manager Jan Willem
Eggink said in an interview in Johannesburg yesterday. The
information is being processed and should be ready by December,
he said.  Shell has started an environmental impact study “so that
if we will go ahead to drill a well we will be ready,” he said.
The timing of a prospect well would be due to rig availability
and the weather window, Eggink said. The cost of each well would
be $150 million to $200 million because of the deep water.  South Africa  had proven oil reserves of 15 million barrels
in January 2011, located to the south and off the west coast
near the Namibian border, according to Oil and Gas Journal. The
country, isolated from foreign investment until apartheid ended
in 1994, has no “significant” crude output, according to the
U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Shell’s area is close to the border of  Namibia  in water
ranging from 500 meters (1,640 feet) to 3,000 meters in depth,
according to Eggink.  To contact the reporter on this story:
