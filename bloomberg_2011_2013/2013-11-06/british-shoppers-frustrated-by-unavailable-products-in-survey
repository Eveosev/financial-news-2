More than seven in 10 British
shoppers were frustrated by a shortage of inventory in a three-month period, according to survey results released today.  About 71 percent of store visitors found their main choice
of product was unavailable at least once, according to the
survey of 750 people conducted by researcher Vanson Bourne on
behalf of software company Infosys.  When unable to find what they want, 39 percent of people
either look elsewhere or delay their purchase, the survey found.  Marks & Spencer Group Plc, (MKS)  which yesterday reported a ninth
straight quarter of declining general-merchandise sales, is
among retailers that have encountered inventory shortages. M&S
last year cited a lack of some popular lines for weak sales. It
said yesterday that availability levels had improved.  To contact the reporters on this story:
