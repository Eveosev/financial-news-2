New Jersey  Republican Jon Runyan
won’t seek re-election to the House, opening a seat in a swing
district that could become a 2014 battleground.  “Politics shouldn’t be a career and I never intended to
make it one,” Runyan said in a statement. “While it has truly
been an honor to serve the people of New Jersey’s  3rd
Congressional District , at this stage in my life, and more
importantly, the lives of my three children, spending time with
them is my top priority.”  Elected in the Republican wave of 2010, Runyan is a former
professional football player. He played for three teams,
including the  Philadelphia Eagles .  The 3rd District stretches from parts of New Jersey’s
Philadelphia suburbs across the state to Toms River and the
Jersey Shore. It also includes several military installations
including McGuire Air Force base and Fort Dix.  The district backed President  Barack Obama  over  Mitt Romney 
52 percent to 47 percent in the 2012 election.  Runyan is the 16th member of the House to announce a
decision not to seek re-election. He’s the second two-term
Republican to announce a retirement in less than a month,
following Tim Griffin of Arkansas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
