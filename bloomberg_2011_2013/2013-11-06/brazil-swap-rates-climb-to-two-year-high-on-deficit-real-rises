Brazil ’s swap rates rose to a two-year high on concern the government isn’t doing enough to curb
widening government deficits.  Swap rates on contracts maturing in January 2016 increased
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 11.61 percent
at 10:11 a.m. in  Sao Paulo , the highest level since September
2011. The real was down 3.3 percent in the past month against
the dollar, the most among 16 currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
It appreciated 0.2 percent to 2.2846 today.  Government officials are defending their fiscal management
after a report showed last week that the deficit swelled in
September to 3.3 percent of gross domestic product, the biggest
since 2009. Brazil Chief of Staff Gleisi Hoffman said in an
interview that fiscal policy won’t change in 2014, the daily
Estado de S. Paulo reported. Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  told
reporters today that Brazil has full control of its budget.  “The fiscal issue is still what investors are focused
on,”  Andre Perfeito , the chief economist at Gradual
Investimentos in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone interview.
“There’s a lack of clarity about what the government will do.”  Treasury Secretary Arno Augustin said Brazil will meet its
targets amid a “speculative attack” fueled by media reports
suggesting the government has lost control of its budget,
