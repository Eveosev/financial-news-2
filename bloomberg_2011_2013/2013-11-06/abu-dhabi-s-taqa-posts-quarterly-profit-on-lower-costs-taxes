Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA) , the
state-controlled utility known as Taqa, reported a profit for
the third-quarter, rebounding from a loss for the same period a
year ago, as operating costs and income taxes fell.  Net income  was 146 million dirhams ($39.8 million),
compared with a year-ago loss of 288 million dirhams, the
company said today in a statement to the Abu Dhabi stock
exchange. Revenue declined 16 percent to 7.4 billion dirhams.  Taqa has stakes in businesses generating power and
producing oil and natural gas in the  Middle East , North Sea,
India and  North America . It expanded last year by adding
oilfield operations in northern Iraq and buying U.K. crude
deposits from BP Plc. Taqa won approval in October from
authorities in  Iraq ’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region to develop
a field there.  Profitability improved as the utility cut operating costs
by 38 percent to 3.3 billion dirhams, according to the
statement. Taxes dropped to 230 million dirhams from 767 million
dirhams in the year-earlier period.  Revenue from oil and natural gas rose 35 percent to 3.45
billion dirhams on higher crude and gas prices, the company
said. Power and water sales fell to 2.6 billion dirhams from 4.9
billion dirhams, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
