RWE AG (RWE) ’s Innogy renewables unit plans
to cut almost half of its jobs as the German utility scales back
clean-energy spending to curb debt.  The job cuts will be made by 2016, Jagna Jera, a
spokeswoman, said today by telephone from Innogy’s headquarters
in Essen. The unit is also seeking partners for its Nordsee-1
offshore wind farm, she said.  RWE, the largest power producer in  Germany , said in March
it would cut renewables investment by half to about 500 million
euros ($676 million) annually from 2014 in a bid to reduce debt
and buoy earnings. Innogy will lose staff from the current 1,500
and sell 75 percent of Nordsee-1, Handelsblatt reported today.  RWE’s decision to curb investment contrasts with plans by
Germany’s government to replace nuclear plants with clean energy
such as solar, wind and biomass. The country is seeking to raise
the share of renewables to at least 35 percent of power output
by the end of the decade from about 23 percent now. It also
plans to add 25 gigawatts of offshore  wind turbines  by 2030.  Innogy will give details of partners at Nordsee-1, as well
as the size of their stakes, at the start of 2014, Jera said.
The wind farm is 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the North Sea
island of Juist.  To contact the reporter on this story:
