  Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) ,  Canada ’s
third-largest insurer, said third-quarter profit beat analysts’
estimates as revenue from insurance and wealth-management sales
increased.  Net income from continuing operations declined 27 percent
to C$324 million ($311 million), or 53 cents a share, from C$441
million, or 74 cents, a year earlier, the Toronto-based firm
said today in a statement. Operating profit, which excludes some
items, was 69 cents a share, compared with the 64-cent  average 
estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Sun Life’s results were driven by strong underlying
performance across our four strategic growth pillars,” Chief
Executive Officer Dean Connor, 57, said in the statement.  Sun Life gained 0.3 percent to C$35.43 at 4 p.m. in
Toronto. The shares have climbed 34 percent this year,  outpacing 
the 16 percent advance of the 46-company Standard & Poor’s/TSX
Financials Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
