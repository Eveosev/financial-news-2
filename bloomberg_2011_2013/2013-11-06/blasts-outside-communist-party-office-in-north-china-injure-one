Homemade bombs exploded outside a
Communist Party office in northern  China  today, killing one
person and scattering steel beads across the scene, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported.  The blasts occurred at about 7:40 a.m. in the Shanxi
province city of Taiyuan, Xinhua said, citing the local public
security bureau. It said eight “explosive sounds” were heard,
and the presence of the steel beads as well as circuit boards
indicate the devices were homemade bombs.  The explosions come with police on alert ahead of a Nov.
9-12 Communist Party gathering in Beijing where leaders may
decide on sweeping reforms to China’s economy. Security was also
stepped up after a sports-utility vehicle rammed into a bridge
outside the Forbidden City near  Tiananmen Square  in Beijing on
Oct. 28, killing the car’s three occupants and two bystanders.  Eight people were injured in the Taiyuan blasts, Xinhua
reported. The explosions came from a flowerbed outside the
provincial Communist Party committee building, state broadcaster
 China Central Television  reported on its official Weibo account.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
