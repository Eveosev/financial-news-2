VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , the wireless carrier
controlled by Russian billionaire  Mikhail Fridman , reported a
2.2 percent drop in third-quarter earnings as intensifying
competition weighed on calling prices.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization fell to $2.47 billion from $2.53 billion a year
earlier, the company said today. Analysts  projected  $2.49
billion, the average of five estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Sales fell 1 percent to $5.69 billion, also missing estimates.  VimpelCom trails  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT)  and  OAO MegaFon (MFON)  in
Russia, its largest market, where competition weighs on calling
prices and carriers vie for data users to maintain growth. Sales
in Russia dropped 1 percent, also hurt by a weaker ruble.  “It’s disappointing that VimpelCom grows in Russia at a
slower pace than its competitors,” Ivan Kim, an analyst at VTB
Capital in Moscow, said by phone.  Amsterdam-based VimpelCom, which operates in 15 countries,
also posted revenue declines for Africa, Asia and Ukraine. Sales
in Italy were little changed.  Shares of VimpelCom  fell  1.4 percent to $14.33 yesterday in
New York, valuing the company at $25.2 billion. The stock has
gained 37 percent this year.  Dividend Confirmed  The company, partly owned by Norway’s  Telenor ASA (TEL) , is
struggling to reduce spending and boost profitability to help
cut $27.6 billion of gross debt stemming from the acquisition of
telecommunications assets, including in Italy and Algeria, from
Egyptian billionaire  Naguib Sawiris  in 2011.  VimpelCom plans to pay an interim dividend of 45 cents a
share in December, at a cost of $791 million. The dividend was
expected by investors, VTB Capital’s Kim said. VimpelCom’s
target is to pay at least 80 cents a year in dividends.  Ebitda as a percentage of sales narrowed to 43.5 percent
from 44 percent. Net income declined 53 percent to $255 million,
hurt by higher taxes.  Mobile subscribers rose 5 percent from a year earlier to
219 million users. The company said it was awarded a license to
offer faster, so-called third-generation wireless service in
Bangladesh, and a provisional 3G license in Algeria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
