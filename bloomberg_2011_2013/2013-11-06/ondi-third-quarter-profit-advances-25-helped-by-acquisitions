Mondi Ltd. (MND) ,  South Africa ’s biggest
packaging company, posted a 25 percent gain in third-quarter
profit as acquisitions and an increase in recycled
containerboard prices helped offset stagnant economies.  Underlying operating profit increased to 172 million euros
($233 million) from 138 million euros, the company said in a
statement today. Sales volumes, adjusted for acquisitions, were
similar to last year and lower than the second quarter because
of factory shutdowns for maintenance and seasonally weaker
demand for uncoated fine paper.  Mondi is opening factories in China and Iraq as the
Johannesburg-based company focuses on  emerging markets  to boost
earnings. Mondi has spent about 1.6 billion euros on
acquisitions since its spinoff from  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  in 2007.  “The current low-growth environment, coupled with
increased competition in certain areas of the business presents
some challenges going into the new year,” the company said.
“The outlook for 2014 remains dependent on the nature and
extent of the macroeconomic recovery and related demand for the
group’s key products.”  Mondi shares fell  3.7 percent  to 175 rand at the close of
trading in Johannesburg. The stock has surged  90 percent  this
year, valuing the company at about 85.5 billion rand ($8.34
billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
