Rubber swung between gains and
losses, trading near a one-month low, as a rebound in crude oil
prices weighed against concern that the Federal Reserve will
reduce stimulus earlier than anticipated.  The contract for delivery in April on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange was little changed at 255.8 yen a kilogram ($2,591 a
metric ton) at 12:08 p.m. after gaining 0.3 percent and dropping
0.7 percent. Futures settled at 255.7 yen yesterday, the lowest
close for a most-active contract since Oct. 4.  West Texas Intermediate rebounded from the lowest level in
five months before a government report that may show U.S. fuel
supplies shrank. Faster-than-estimated expansion in a U.S.
services gauge stoked speculation the world’s largest economy is
strong enough to allow the Fed to reduce stimulus earlier than
analysts had projected.  Investors remain cautious about the direction of rubber
after crude rebounded and the timing of the Fed’s tapering
remains unclear, said Naohiro Niimura, a partner at research
company Market Risk Advisory in Tokyo.  Rubber for May delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
was little changed at 19,475  yuan  ($3,195) a ton. Thai rubber
free-on-board dropped 0.3 percent to 77.85 baht ($2.49) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
