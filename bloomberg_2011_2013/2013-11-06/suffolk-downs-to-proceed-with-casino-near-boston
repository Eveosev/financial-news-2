The Suffolk Downs horse racing track,
which straddles two cities in  Massachusetts , will proceed with
plans to develop a casino on its land in Revere after voters in
East Boston rejected the proposal.  Residents of Revere approved the proposal yesterday,
prompting the city’s mayor to ask Suffolk Downs to build the
casino on the racetrack’s 52 acres that lie in his city.  “We respect the vote of our neighbors in East Boston,”
Chip Tuttle, Suffolk Downs’ chief operating officer, said in an
e-mailed statement.  Massachusetts legalized casino gambling two years ago. The
legislation requires the approval of local voters before
applicants can obtain a state license. While voters in East
Boston rejected the proposal 56 percent to 44 percent, Revere
residents approved the plan 59 percent to 38 percent, according
to the cities’ websites.  Revere Mayor Dan Rizzo called Suffolk Downs last night and
asked the company to reshape its project so that it could be
built there, he said in a statement.  “Our community will continue to fight so that Revere can
win this boost to our local economy,” Rizzo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
