Penn West Petroleum Ltd. (PWT)  is targeting
as much as C$2 billion ($1.9 billion) of asset sales before 2015
as part of a strategic review.  Of that total, about C$485 million of disposals are
expected to close before the end of 2013, the Calgary-based
company said today in a statement. Those sales involve assets in
the Wainwright,  Grande Prairie  and Southern Alberta areas.  “Not only does this represent a meaningful step toward
addressing our balance sheet, it also assists in focusing our
efforts on our core properties,” Chief Executive Officer David
Roberts said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
