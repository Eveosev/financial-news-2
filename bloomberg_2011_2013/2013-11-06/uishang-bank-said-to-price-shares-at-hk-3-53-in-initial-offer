Huishang Bank Corp., a lender in the
eastern Chinese province of Anhui, sold shares at HK$3.53 (46
cents) each in its  Hong Kong  initial public offering, said two
people with knowledge of the matter.  The lender and some of its shareholders raised $1.2 billion
from the sale of 2.61 billion shares, said the people, who asked
not to be identified because the information is private. The
shares had been marketed at HK$3.47 to HK$3.88 apiece, according
to a prospectus.  Huishang, based in Hefei city, is boosting capital through
Hong Kong’s biggest banking IPO in nearly three years, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Chinese lenders  are tapping Hong
Kong’s equity market as regulators maintain a freeze on domestic
initial public offerings.  The offering includes 2.5 billion new shares, the
prospectus shows.  Bank of Chongqing Co., based in  China ’s most populous city,
and some of its investors raised $548 million from a Hong Kong
initial offer on Oct. 31, Bloomberg data show. China Everbright
Bank Co., which is listed in  Shanghai , said Oct. 16 it won
regulatory approval to sell as many as 12 billion shares
overseas, paving the way for a first-time stock sale in Hong
Kong.  Huishang had assets of 324.2 billion  yuan  ($53.2 billion),
loans of 163.8 billion yuan and deposits of 239.5 billion yuan
at the end of last year, according to the prospectus. The
lender, founded in 2005, will use the IPO proceeds to strengthen
its core capital base.  The bank’s shares will start trading on Nov. 12, the
prospectus shows.  Huishang’s offering is the largest banking IPO in Hong Kong
since Chongqing Rural Commercial Bank Co. raised $1.7 billion in
December 2010. Excluding the Huishang sale, companies have
raised $10 billion in Hong Kong IPOs this year, more than triple
the amount for the same period of 2012, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
