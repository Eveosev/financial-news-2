Raw sugar fell for a second day in
New York on speculation a weaker Brazilian currency will spur
more selling from the world’s largest producer. Cocoa slipped.  Brazil ’s real lost 1.9 percent yesterday against the
dollar, the most among emerging-market currencies, on concern
the government is doing too little to control budget deficits
and avoid a credit-rating cut. Declines by the Brazilian
currency, which slumped 3.4 percent in a month, tend to
encourage export sales of local sweetener priced in dollars.  “Brazil real weakness in the last 24 hours has stalled the
market,” James Kirkup, a London-based broker at ABN Amro
Markets U.K. Ltd., said by e-mail. “It’s what weighed on the
market from mid-session yesterday.”  Raw sugar for delivery in March slid 0.2 percent to 18.22
cents a pound by 6:18 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Refined, or white, sugar for the same delivery month gained 0.1
percent to $484.80 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  Brazilian government officials defended their fiscal policy
after a report last week showed that the deficit swelled in
September to almost the widest level since the global financial
crisis in 2008.  Thailand , the world’s second-biggest sugar exporter, sold
60,666.66 tons of raw sweetener to Agro Grain, Cargill and
Vitol, according to Thai Cane & Sugar Corp. The sales took place
at premiums to futures prices of 0.71 cent to 0.85 cent a pound,
depending on quality and shipment period.  Premiums “were low and symptomatic of the record
forthcoming Thai crop,” Kirkup said.  Cocoa for delivery in March fell 0.1 percent to $2,743 a
ton on ICE. Cocoa for the same delivery month slid 0.1 percent
to 1,736 pounds ($2,795) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Arabica coffee for delivery in December was little changed
at $1.035 a pound in New York. Robusta coffee for delivery in
January fell 0.5 percent to $1,468 a ton in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
