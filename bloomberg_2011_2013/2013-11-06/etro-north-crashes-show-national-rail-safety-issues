Two  Metro-North Railroad  accidents
this year, one fatal and one that injured dozens of passengers,
show rail safety needs more money and attention, a U.S. senator
said as regulators began a two-day hearing.  “It’s a national problem,” Senator  Richard Blumenthal , a
 Connecticut  Democrat, told reporters before a National
Transportation Safety Board hearing in  Washington . “Metro-North
is just the most visible recent example.”  The NTSB is investigating the infrastructure and
maintenance history and practices of the Northeast U.S. commuter
railroad following a May 17 crash between two of its trains near
Bridgeport, Connecticut. One train derailed as it traveled over
broken track and was hit by another headed the opposite way, in
a crash Metro-North said caused $18.5 million in damage.  A rail worker died in a second accident 11 days later in
West Haven, Connecticut, after being struck by a Metro-North
train.  U.S. lawmakers last passed legislation strengthening rail
safety in 2008 following a preventable head-on crash in  Los
Angeles . Blumenthal said it’s time again for “stronger
standards for scrutiny and oversight as well as for general
maintenance and inspection” of railroads.  “This hearing will illuminate key safety issues from these
two accidents, so that the entire industry, from manufacturers
to operators to regulators, can benefit from the lessons learned
in order to prevent loss of life and injuries in the future,”
NTSB Chairwoman  Deborah Hersman  said at the hearing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
