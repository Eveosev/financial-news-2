South African white corn futures
declined the most in more than three weeks on the prospects for
rainfall boosting crop development in some main growing regions.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, fell 1 percent to 2,438 rand ($238) a metric ton, the
most since Oct. 11, by the midday close on the South African
Futures Exchange. The yellow variety for delivery in the same
month dropped 0.3 percent to 2,338 rand a ton.  The town of Welkom in the Free State, the region that
produces about 41 percent of the nation’s corn, will have a 30
percent chance of rain today and tomorrow, according to the
 South African Weather Service  website. Lichtenburg, a town in
the North West province, where 14 percent of the country’s grain
is grown, has a 30 percent chance of rain on Nov. 9 and Nov. 10
and a 60 percent chance on Nov. 11 and Nov. 12.  “There is some rain forecast over the weekend which would
also cause prices to drop a little,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at
BVG (Pty) Ltd., said by e-mail.  South Africa  is the continent’s biggest corn producer. A
meal made from white corn is a staple food in the nation and the
yellow variety is mostly fed to animals.  Wheat for delivery in December declined 0.1 percent to
3,561 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
