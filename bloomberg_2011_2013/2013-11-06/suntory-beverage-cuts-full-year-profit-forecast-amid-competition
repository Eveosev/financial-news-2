Suntory Beverage & Food Ltd. (2587) , the
soft-drink maker that raised $4 billion in Japan’s largest
initial public offering this year, cut its profit projection on
more competition, marketing costs and Europe’s economic slump.  Net income will probably be 31 billion yen ($314 million)
for the year ending December, lower than its previous forecast
of 35 billion yen, the Suntory Holdings Ltd. unit said in a
statement to  Tokyo ’s stock exchange yesterday. That compares
with a 35.9 billion yen average estimate from seven analysts
compiled by Bloomberg.  The beverage company, which gets about 30 percent of its
revenue from overseas markets, is accelerating its expansion
outside of Japan as an aging population limits domestic growth.
In  Europe , where it gets 13 percent of its sales, it faces
surging unemployment and weakening growth.  Suntory Beverage fell as much as 3.1 percent to 3,160 yen
in Tokyo today, headed for the biggest loss since July.  The company’s profit jumped 57 percent in the nine months
ended September to 24.5 billion yen, it said in the statement.
Sales climbed 12 percent to 837 billion yen.  Europe Economy  The European Union has trimmed its forecast for euro-area
growth next year and raised its unemployment estimate as the
economy struggled to regain momentum after a record-long
recession. Unemployment will be 12.2 percent in 2014, higher
than the 12.1 percent predicted six months ago, according to the
European Commission.  In  Japan , sales of small-size products that provide high
revenue, such as the 500-millilitre bottles, are expected to
fall short of initial expectations amid intensified competition.  Tokyo-based Suntory Beverage agreed in September to pay
1.35 billion pounds ($2.2 billion) to buy the Lucozade and
Ribena drink brands from GlaxoSmithKline Plc as it seeks to
reduce its reliance on its domestic market.  Sales rose 3.5 percent to 542 billion yen in Japan during
the nine-month period, while they climbed 32 percent to 295.2
billion yen in its overseas business, according to the
statement.  The Japanese beverage group bought France-based Orangina
Schweppes Group for 300 billion yen in 2009 and paid 600 million
euros in the same year for  New Zealand ’s Frucor Beverages Group.  Suntory had a 20 percent share of Japan’s non-alcoholic
drink market in 2012, the second-biggest after Coca-Cola Co.’s
28 percent, according to Inryosoken, a research company.  The company had said it plans to double sales to 2 trillion
yen by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
