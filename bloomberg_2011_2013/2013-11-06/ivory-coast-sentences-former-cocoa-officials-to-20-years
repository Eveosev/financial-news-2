A court in Ivory Coast, the world’s
biggest cocoa grower, sentenced 15 former managers of state-run
cocoa agencies to 20 years in prison following the nation’s
biggest probe into corruption in the industry.  The defendants were found guilty of charges including
misappropriation of corporate assets, embezzlement of public
funds, breach of trust and fraud, Presiding Judge Hamed
Coulibaly said in the commercial capital, Abidjan, today.  Henri Amouzou, the former managing director of the cocoa
farmers’ development fund, will appeal his 20-year sentence,
Adje Luc, his attorney, said by phone.  Former President Laurent Gbagbo ordered a magistrate in
2007 to investigate how the five state agencies that ran the
cocoa industry spent more than $1 billion in royalties from 2002
to 2008. The trial started in September 2010. The five agencies
ran the industry under the authority of the agriculture and
finance ministries from 2000 to 2011.  The agencies were funded by royalties on the per kilogram
price of the bean fixed by the government at the start of the
harvesting season.  Millions of dollars were transferred from the agencies’
bank accounts to private accounts abroad, fictitious farmer
cooperatives and shell companies from 2002 to 2008, prosecutors
said during the trial.  To contact the reporters on this story:
