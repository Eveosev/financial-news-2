this weekend’s third plenum fails to produce drastically needed
economic reforms,” Patrick Chovanec, chief strategist at
Silvercrest Asset Management, wrote in a report. “Regretfully,
none of the evidence to-date suggests that China’s ruling party
has a real appetite for game-changing market policy.”  The financials gauge slumped 1.6 percent, the most since

an analyst at Shenyin & Wanguo Co.  The index of energy companies rallied 1.7 percent. Sinopec,
the largest Chinese oil refiner, gained 2.2 percent to 4.72
