European  stocks  climbed to a five-year high after companies from Alstom SA to ING Groep NV posted
earnings that beat analysts’ estimates, and as industrial data
from  Germany  and the U.K. improved.  Alstom gained the most in 16 months after posting operating
profit that exceeded estimates and saying it will seek to raise
as much as 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion) from asset sales. ING
jumped 3.5 percent after net income beat projections.  Adecco SA (ADEN) 
rose 3.6 percent after the world’s largest provider of temporary
workers predicted that demand for flexible labor will increase
in  Europe  as the economy recovers.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.4 percent to 323.26 at
the close of trading, its highest level since May 22, 2008. The
equity benchmark has rallied 16 percent so far in 2013, its best
performance since 2009.  “As long as the macro improvement remains, investors will
continue to expect a rebound in corporate earnings,” said Dirk Thiels, who helps oversee 65 billion euros as head of  investment
management  at KBC Asset Management NV in Brussels. “The strong
rally we’ve had in Europe shows the market is pricing in
earnings upgrades. Even if earnings growth may lag the economy
this season, we are willing to wait another quarter to see
evidence of a turnaround.”  A report from the  Office for National Statistics  showed
U.K.  industrial production  rose 0.9 percent in September,
rebounding from its biggest decline in almost a year and
exceeding the median forecast for growth of 0.6 percent.  Factory Orders  A release from Germany’s Economy Ministry showed  factory
orders  in Europe’s largest economy increased 3.3 percent in
September. That exceeded the 0.5 percent median estimate of
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  Markit Economics’ gauge of services industries in the 17-nation euro area fell at a slower-than- projected  rate in
October. A separate report from the European Union’s statistics
agency showed that retail sales in the currency bloc increased
0.3 percent in September from last year, less than the 0.6
percent gain that economists had predicted.  The  European Central Bank  will cut its benchmark  interest
rate  to 0.25 percent at tomorrow’s meeting, according to three
out of 70 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Eight of 38
economists in a separate survey forecast policy makers will
lower interest rates in December.  National benchmark indexes climbed in every Western-European market except the U.K. and Iceland. The U.K.’s FTSE 100
fell 0.1 percent, while Germany’s DAX increased 0.4 percent.
France’s CAC 40 rose 0.8 percent.  Alstom, ING  Alstom, the French maker of trains, gained 5.8 percent to
28.67 euros, its biggest advance since June 2012. Operating
profit in the period between April 1 and Sept. 30 fell to 695
million euros from 703 million euros last year. That still beat
the average analyst estimate of 664 million euros. Chief
Executive Officer Patrick Kron said the company will seek to
sell a minority stake in Alstom Transport SA and other assets,
according to a statement.  ING added 3.5 percent to 9.60 euros, rebounding from its
biggest loss since August. Net income dropped 85 percent to 101
million euros in the third quarter from a year earlier,
following a 950 million-euro writedown on the sale of its South
Korean life insurance unit. Analysts had predicted a 27.3
million-euro loss. The Dutch financial-services company also
said it has reached an agreement with the European Commission to
sell more than 50 percent of ING Life Japan by the end of 2015.  Adecco Jumps  Adecco climbed 3.6 percent to 68.50 Swiss francs after
saying third-quarter net income surged 61 percent to 190 million
euros. That exceeded the 138.2 million-euro  average estimate  of
five analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Sales dropped less in
 France  this quarter, its largest market, while revenue from
Spain and  Portugal  showed its first quarterly increase in more
than two years, Adecco said in a statement.  Axel Springer AG, the publisher of the Die Welt and Bild-Zeitung newspapers in Germany, advanced 2 percent to 44.28
euros. Third-quarter sales rose 3.6 percent to 815.8 million
euros from last year, beating the 808 million-euro  average
estimate  compiled by Bloomberg.  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  surged 15 percent to 167.20 kroner,
its highest price since May 2011. The world’s largest wind-turbine maker forecast an earnings-before-interest-and-taxes 
margin  of at least 2 percent in 2013, up from 1 percent in the
second quarter. Vestas also said free  cash flow  will exceed 500
million euros and may climb as high as 700 million euros, more
than double the previous estimate.  K&S, Experian  K&S AG dropped 3.7 percent to 20.05 euros after Moody’s
Investors Service cut its rating on the fertilizer producer’s
debt to below investment grade. The credit-rating company cited
declining potash prices and said K&S may need to raise
additional debt to invest in a mine in  Canada .  Experian Plc slumped 6.4 percent to 1,182 pence, its
biggest decline in five years. The credit-reporting service said
it will stop its share buybacks after agreeing to spend $850
million on buying Passport Health Communications Inc., a U.S.
provider of data and software for health-care payments. Experian
said in May that it planned to buy back $500 million of shares
over the following 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
