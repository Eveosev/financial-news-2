Ryan Riess, a 23-year-old poker
professional, won the  World Series of Poker ’s main event and its
$8.36 million first prize.  Riess was the youngest player left among the nine who
reached the final table at the $10,000 buy-in No-Limit Texas
Hold’em World Championship at the  Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino 
in  Las Vegas . The Michigan State graduate beat 29-year-old
amateur poker player Jay Farber, a VIP host in Las Vegas, in
heads-up play to win the top prize and main-event bracelet.  With 14.2 million chips to Riess’s 176.5 million, Farber
went all in while holding a queen and five to Riess’s ace and
king. After revealing a four, a jack, a 10 and a three for the
common cards, Farber needed a five to stay alive. The final card
was a four, giving Riess the victory.  Riess was among 6,352 participants in the 44th annual  World
Series  of Poker championship, which started July 6. The field
was cut to nine players by July 16, with a 110-day break before
play started at the final table on Nov. 4.  Farber, playing in the main event for the fourth time,
received almost $5.2 million for his runner-up finish.  The World Series of Poker is a 62-event collection of
various types of poker tournaments that began in May and ended
with the main event, which had a prize pool of $59.7 million.
The total prize pool of $197 million and 79,471 entrants for the
World Series each were records.  Seven of the nine players who reached the final table
earned at least $1 million each. Final-table play was televised
on a 15-minute delay by ESPN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
