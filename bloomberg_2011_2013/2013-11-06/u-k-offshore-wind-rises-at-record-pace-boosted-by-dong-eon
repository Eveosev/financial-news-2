U.K. offshore wind capacity rose by a
record 79 percent in the year to the end of June as four larger
projects started generating.  Turbines around U.K. shores increased to 3,321 megawatts
from 1,858 megawatts a year earlier, according to an e-mailed
study by industry group RenewableUK. The numbers were bolstered
by large ventures including the 630-megawatt London Array, the
world’s biggest offshore plant owned by Dong Energy A/S, EON SE
and Masdar Abu Dhabi Future Energy Co.  The study highlights how offshore wind farms are getting
bigger as developers gain experience and the technology matures.
It’s also a boost for the industry Britain is relying on to meet
renewable goals after reports  Centrica Plc (CNA)  may abandon an
offshore wind farm unless it gets more state aid.  Growth will continue “as long as government policy is
supportive,” RenewableUK Chief Executive Officer Maria McCaffery said in a statement.  Offshore wind additions also outstripped onshore wind for
the first time. Turbines on land increased 25 percent to 6,389
megawatts, London-based RenewableUK said.  Combined onshore and offshore wind capacity rose 40 percent
in the year, with the new capacity contributing 2 billion pounds
($3.2 billion) for the economy, RenewableUK said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
