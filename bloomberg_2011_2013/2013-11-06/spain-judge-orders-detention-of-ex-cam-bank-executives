A Spanish  judge  ordered the detention
of five former executives of  Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo  as
he investigates alleged irregularities in the running of the
failed savings bank.  Police have already detained two executives including
former managing director Roberto Lopez Abad by order of National
Court Judge Javier Gomez Bermudez, a Madrid-based court
spokesman said in a phone interview today. The executives are
due to appear before the judge tomorrow, said the spokesman, who
asked not to be named in line with the courtâ€™s policy.  The Bank of Spain said in July 2011 it would take over CAM
and remove its management as losses linked to real estate loans
wrecked its business. Banco Sabadell SA then agreed to buy the
lender for one euro in a deal financed and guaranteed by other
Spanish banks that allowed the Bank of Spain to remove CAM from
public ownership.  There were no listings for Lopez Abad in the Valencia
region, according to the online phone directory
