Bill de Blasio, who built his
underdog campaign for New York mayor on promises to restrain
police stop-and-frisk tactics and reduce income inequality, won
election by a wide margin, putting a Democrat in  City Hall  for
the first time in 20 years.  De Blasio, 52, New Yorkâ€™s elected public advocate, beat
Republican Joseph Lhota, a deputy to former Mayor  Rudolph
Giuliani , who conceded in a televised address. The Associated
Press also called the race, based on preliminary results.  A self-described progressive, de Blasio was in fourth place
in the race for the Democratic nomination as recently as June.
He becomes the first Democrat to lead the most populous U.S.
city after two terms of Giuliani and three of  Michael Bloomberg ,
who ran twice as a Republican and once as an independent on the
Republican ballot line.  The current mayor, the founder and majority owner of
Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, is barred from seeking a
fourth term.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
