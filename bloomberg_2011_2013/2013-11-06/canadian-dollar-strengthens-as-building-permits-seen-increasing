Canada (CANLNETJ) ’s dollar strengthened for the
first time in three days amid a rally in commodities including
crude oil, the nation’s biggest export.  The currency, called the loonie, gained versus most major
peers after a Canadian business barometer rose more than
forecast. Crude oil, the nation’s biggest export, climbed from a
five-month low. The loonie’s gains were tempered as investors
awaited October employment reports for the U.S. and  Canada  this
week that are forecast to show declines.  “Crude is up close to 2 percent, that’s probably filtering
through and providing a bit of a bid for the loonie,” David Doyle, a strategist at Macquarie Capital Markets, said by phone
from Toronto. “Commodities are up generally and the loonie,
which is seen as a commodity type of currency, probably has some
benefit from that.”  The loonie, nicknamed for the image of the aquatic bird on
the C$1 coin, advanced 0.4 percent to C$1.0418 per  U.S. dollar 
at 5 p.m. in Toronto. The currency slid Oct. 30 to C$1.0497, the
weakest level since Sept. 6. One Canadian dollar purchases 95.99
U.S. cents.  The cost to insure against declines in the currency versus
its U.S. peer rose to a three-week high. The three-month so-called 25-delta risk-reversal rate reached 1.29 percent, the
highest level since Oct. 17. Risk reversals measure the premium
on options contracts to sell Canadian dollars versus buying U.S.
contracts that do the opposite.  Volatility Gauge  Implied volatility for three-month options on Canada’s
dollar versus its U.S. counterpart touched 6 percent, the
highest intraday level since Oct. 28. The measure is used to set
option prices and gauge the expected pace of currency swings.
The average for this year is 6.7 percent.  The U.S. dollar fell to C$1.0398 on Nov. 4, approaching its
100-day moving average at C$1.0386, before strengthening.  “All the technicals suggest dollar-Canada should be moving
higher,” said  Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at Bank
of  Nova Scotia , by telephone from Toronto. “Earlier this week
we made an attempt to break down below the 100-day moving
average, and dollar-Canada failed to do that and has since
bounced back higher. That could suggest there’s some near-term
upside pressure.”  Canada’s benchmark 10-year government bond was little
changed,  yielding  2.53 percent. The price of the 1.5 percent
security maturing in June 2023 slipped 1 cent to C$91.28.  Bond Auction  The  Bank of Canada  auctioned C$3.4 billion ($3.3 billion)
of five-year debt at an average yield of 1.907 percent. The 1.75
percent securities mature in March 2019. The average yield at
the Aug. 28 sale of five-year notes was 1.957 percent.  Today’s offering drew $8.9 billion in bids. The coverage
ratio, which gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the
amount offered, was 2.63, versus an average of 2.62 at the past
five auctions of the maturity.  Futures of crude oil rallied as much as 2.2 percent to
$95.40 a barrel in  New York  before trading at $94.90, up 1.6
percent. They closed yesterday at $93.37, the lowest level since
June. Standard & Poor’s  GSCI Index (SPGSCI)  of 24 commodities increased
for the first time in seven days, gaining 0.5 percent.  A  discount  on Canadian oil declined from a 10-month high.
The Western Canada Select Crude Oil Differential narrowed to
$41.20 a barrel after reaching $42 yesterday, the most since the
record $42.50 reached in December.  ‘U.S. Numbers’  “Any time you see oil appreciate, that tends to be
supportive of Canada’s currency,”  Joe Manimbo , a market analyst
in  Washington  at Western Union Business Solutions, a unit of
Western Union Co., said in phone interview. “But I just think
the broader market move is one where the dollar has ceded some
ground on caution before the U.S. numbers.”  U.S. employers added 120,000 positions last month, versus
148,000 in September, economists in Bloomberg survey forecast
before data due in Washington on Nov. 8. U.S. economic growth in
the third quarter slowed to 2 percent, from 2.5 percent in the
previous period, a report tomorrow is projected to show.  Canada’s employers added 11,000 jobs in October, a separate
Bloomberg survey showed before a Nov. 8 report, compared with
11,900 the  previous month  and 59,200 in August.  The Canadian dollar added to gains today after a report on
the website of Western University’s business school showed the
Ivey purchasing managers’ index  rose  to 62.8 in October on a
seasonally adjusted basis, the highest since May, following a
September reading of 51.9. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
predicted the gauge would reach 52.0. Readings of more than 50
indicate purchasing by governments and companies advanced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
