Deutsche Annington Immobilien SE (ANN) , the
German residential landlord that sold shares to the public for
the first time in July, said nine-month profit rose 41 percent
after interest payments fell.  Funds from operations excluding divestments, a measure of a
property company’s ability to generate cash, climbed to 163.4
million euros ($221 million) from 115.7 million euros a year
earlier, the Bochum-based company said in a statement today. The
company plans to make acquisitions to boost its profitability,
Chief Executive Officer Rolf Buch said on a conference call with
reporters today.  “Annington is very active in this market again, and we’re
happy to buy portfolios bigger than 5,000 units,” Buch said.
The company will only make acquisitions if they don’t hurt its
 credit rating  and enhance its FFO and net asset value, he said.  Borrowing costs declined in the quarter after Deutsche
Annington restructured its GRAND commercial mortgage-backed
security. The company owns 180,000 apartments in cities
including Berlin and Cologne, making it  Germany ’s largest
residential landlord.  Interest payments on Deutsche Annington’s debt fell to
166.3 million euros from 201.9 million euros a year earlier.  Net income more than doubled in the first nine months to
469.2 million euros, or 2.25 euros a share, from 183.2 million
euros, or 92 cents, a year earlier, Deutsche Annington said.
Rental income was little changed at 546.1 million euros.  The landlord repeated that its FFO for the whole year will
be at the upper range of 210 million euros to 220 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
