Linking the  Federal Reserve ’s zero
interest rate policy to economic data, rather than a calendar
date, prompts investors to adjust their expectations for policy
to changes in the economy, according to a Federal Reserve Bank
of  New York  study.  “By specifying economic conditions rather than a calendar
date, the central bank allows the market to determine the
expected duration of the zero-bound policy based on its evolving
view about the economic recovery,” according to the paper on
the New York Fed’s website, which was co-authored by Katherine Femia, Steven Friedman and  Brian Sack .  “If economic data or other information pointed to a weaker
economic recovery and a slower decline in the  unemployment rate ,
market participants would automatically extend the expected
duration of the zero-rate policy, providing additional stimulus
to help offset the weaker outlook,” the paper said.  The Federal Open Market Committee has said since December
that it won’t consider raising the main interest rate as long as
joblessness exceeds 6.5 percent and the outlook for inflation is
no higher than 2.5 percent. The data thresholds replaced the
Fed’s earlier plan to hold the benchmark interest rate near zero
at least through the middle of 2015.  “If the ultimate objective of policy guidance is to
provide information about the central bank’s policy reaction
function, then the most direct approach is for the central bank
to communicate directly about the economic conditions that are
affecting the policy stance, rather than having investors make
inference about those conditions from the use of calendar
guidance,” the authors said in the paper dated this month.  Monetary Policy  Sack from 2009 until 2012 led the New York Fed’s markets
group, which implements the central bank’s  monetary policy . He
is currently a co-director of global economics at D.E. Shaw &
Co., a New York-based hedge fund.  William English , head of the Fed’s Division of Monetary
Affairs, wrote in a separate paper that the strategy of not
raising  interest rates  if unemployment is above 6.5 percent has
provided effective stimulus, and that an even lower threshold
could be helpful.  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said Sept. 18 in Washington that
“the first increases in short-term rates might not occur until
the unemployment rate is considerably below 6.5 percent.”
Joblessness was 7.2 percent in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
