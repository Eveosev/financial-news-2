Verisk Analytics Inc. (VRSK) , the supplier
of actuarial and risk data to banks and insurers, posted the
biggest drop since its 2009 public offering after revenue missed
analysts’ estimates as growth slowed in the health segment.  Verisk slumped 8.6 percent to $62 at 4 p.m. in New York.
Shares of the  Jersey City , New Jersey-based company advanced 22
percent this year, compared with the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index’s 24 percent climb.  Third-quarter revenue of $438.6 million fell short of the
average $444.8 million estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 13
analysts. Sales tied to health care at the decision-analytics
operation climbed 6.2 percent from the third quarter of 2012 to
$73.6 million, the company said in a statement late yesterday.
That compares with a 21 percent increase in the second quarter.  “We’d expect this slowdown to generate some concerns and
questions,”  William Clark , an analyst at Keefe Bruyette &
Woods, said in a research note following Verisk’s earnings
report. “Certainly something to keep an eye on.”  Net income for the quarter rose 16 percent to $96.4 million
on growth in its insurance and financial-services business,
Verisk said in the statement.  “Our health-care business delivered growth that was below
our plan,” the company said in the statement. “But we remain
enthusiastic about our longer-term outlook.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
