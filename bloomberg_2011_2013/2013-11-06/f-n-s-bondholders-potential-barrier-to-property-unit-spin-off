Fraser & Neave Ltd. (FNN)  may learn as soon
as today whether bondholders will allow the company to amend the
terms on S$808.25 million ($650 million) of debt so it can spin
off its property unit without triggering a default.  The beverages and property conglomerate, controlled by Thai
billionaire  Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi , asked debt holders to
waive certain default clauses and allow the company to buy back
the securities on or before June 30, 2014 for a fee, according
to Oct. 28 announcements to the Singapore stock exchange. The
company offered to pay 100 cents on the dollar and a fee worth
half of the note’s coupon and the accrued interest on the date
that Fraser & Neave can call the securities, the documents show.  Failure to secure a positive vote may upset F&N’s plans to
carve off its real estate division via a Singapore listing later
this year. The 130 year-old conglomerate is seeking to separate
that division from its other operations including its beverages
and publishing units to focus on each units’ individual
expansion strategies after the S$13.8 billion takeover by
 Thailand ’s richest man.  “We have considered all options, and decided that this
would be the most consistent and fair approach for us to
adopt,” said Jennifer Yu, a Singapore-based investor relations
manager at F&N. “We are grateful for and appreciate the support
of our lenders.”  Bond Yields  The terms are below market levels for F&N’s higher coupon
bonds, according to three investors in the S$108 million 5.5
percent notes due 2016, who all intend to vote against the
proposal.  Another investor said F&N’s S$200 million of 6 percent
notes due 2019 were being offered for sale at about S109.378
cents on the dollar prior to the announcement, while the company
is offering S103.25 cents for the notes, including the early
acceptance fee.  The S$108 million debentures were yielding 2.7 percent on
Nov. 5 compared with 2.43 percent at the start of the quarter,
Bloomberg-compiled pricing show. Average corporate bond yields
in  Singapore  fell to 3.087 percent on Oct. 30, the least since
June 24, HSBC Holdings Plc indexes show.  Early-bird Bonus  Bondholders accepting today will receive an early-bird
bonus of S$625 per S$250,000 of notes, while those investors who
say yes by Nov. 12 will receive S$375 for every S$250,000 of
securities, the documents show.  F&N will hold a shareholders meeting on Nov. 13 about the
spin off of Frasers Centrepoint Ltd., which had  S$9 billion of
assets  as of June. Charoen’s company will vote in favor of the
transaction, according to an Aug. 27 statement.  F&N’s shares have fallen 40 percent this year, and closed
down 1.9 percent at S$5.79 in Singapore. The company in July
undertook a capital reduction exercise, returning some S$4.7
billion to shareholders.  Bonds subject to the vote also include S$150 million of
3.62 percent debt, S$50 million of 2.45 percent securities due
2015, S$220 million of 2.48 percent notes due 2016 and S$80
million of 3.15 percent debentures due 2018, according to F&N’s
Oct. 28 announcement.  Charoen, who acquired F&N via his companies including  Thai
Beverage Pcl (THBEV)  earlier this year, had a net worth of $9.2 billion
as of Nov. 5, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
