Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) , the
Chinese solar manufacturer whose main unit was dragged into
bankruptcy in March, filed for provisional liquidation in the
 Cayman Islands  and may also seek protection from creditors in
the U.S.  The Cayman Islands petition, where the company is
incorporated, will provide time to complete restructuring
negotiations, Suntech said in a statement yesterday. If
approved, the company will consider filing for Chapter 15
bankruptcy protection in the U.S., where its American depositary
receipts are listed and it has public debt.  The ADRs, each worth one ordinary share, fell 17 percent to
$1.25 at the close in  New York , the most since May 22.  Suntech’s main unit, was pulled into bankruptcy proceedings
by Chinese banks after the Wuxi, China-based company missed a
bond payment in March.  Shunfeng Photovoltaic International Ltd. (1165) ,
agreed to buy the unit on Nov. 1 for 3 billion  yuan  ($492
million). The company was the world’s biggest solar panel maker
in 2011.  Suntech reiterated yesterday that it has an agreement with
creditors that includes a recapitalization and restructuring
plan, which involves a debt-to-equity swap and the entry of a
strategic investor.  The company intends to challenge a petition for involuntary
bankruptcy filed against it in the U.S. by four bondholders last
month, it said Oct. 31. The investors hold less than 0.3 percent
of Suntech’s convertible senior notes that were due in March and
went unpaid.  Investors funneled $1.28 billion into the solar company in
bond and stock sales since 2005, the bondholders’ filing shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
