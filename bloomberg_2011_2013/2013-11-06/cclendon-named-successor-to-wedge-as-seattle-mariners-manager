Lloyd McClendon, the hitting coach
for the Detroit Tigers, was named the 16th manager of Major
League Baseball’s  Seattle  Mariners.  McClendon, 54, has spent eight seasons with the Tigers
after serving five as manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates.  “Lloyd is a bright and articulate guy,” Mariners General
Manager Jack Zduriencik said yesterday in a statement. “He is a
tireless worker and is very respected by the players with whom
he has worked.”  The Mariners said Sept. 28 that Eric Wedge, 45, decided not
to return for a fourth season as manager after the team finished
71-91 this year. Wedge, the 2007 American League manager of the
year, led the Mariners to three straight fourth-place finishes
in the AL West. Seattle last had a winning season in 2009.  McClendon joined the Tigers as a bullpen coach in 2006
before moving to the hitting position. The Tigers led the majors
in 2013 with a .283 batting average and were second in runs
scored with 796 as the team advanced to the American League
Championship Series.  The Tigers won Central Division titles and advanced to the
playoffs in each of the past three seasons. They were swept by
the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last year.  “Seattle has a tremendous group of talented players and
the fans and city should be excited about the club’s future,”
McClendon said. “I’m looking for this group to take a big step
forward.”  McClendon, who served as a coach for the National League at
the All-Star Game in 2003, never had a winning season as manager
of the Pirates and was fired in September 2005 having compiled a
336-446 record.  McClendon had a 16-year professional playing career after
being selected by the  New York  Mets in the eighth round of the
1980 draft. He played for the Cincinnati Reds, Chicago Cubs and
the Pirates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
