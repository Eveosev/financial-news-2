Crude options volatility fell as the
underlying futures gained the most in five weeks.  Implied volatility for at-the-money December options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was
20.13 percent at 5:10 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
down from 21.75 yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery rose
$1.43, or 1.5 percent, to settle at $94.80 a barrel on the
Nymex, the biggest one-day advance since Oct. 2. U.S. gasoline
demand rose to the highest level since July, trimming fuel
inventories, the Energy Information Administration said.  Puts, or bets that prices would fall, accounted for 54
percent of electronic trading volume today. The most-active
options were January $113 calls, which were unchanged at 3 cents
a barrel with 4,651 lots trading as of 5:19 p.m. December $90
puts fell 22 cents to 15 cents on volume of 4,421 lots.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 56 percent of
the 132,512 lots traded. December $90 puts rose 13 cents to 37
cents a barrel with 6,907 contracts trading. December $93 puts
rose 41 cents to $1.17 on volume of 6,346 lots.  Open interest yesterday was highest for December $80 puts,
with 42,541 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 40,798
lots and December $85 puts with 35,539.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
