Toronto-Dominion Bank’s Martine Irman
and  Bank of Montreal (BMO) ’s Eric Tripp were recognized for their
efforts supporting women in Canadian  capital markets .  Irman, a vice chairman at TD Securities, and Tripp, 57,
president of BMO Capital Markets, today received the Women in
Capital Markets Award for Leadership, a recognition for senior
executives who’ve shown commitment to advancing and supporting
women in the securities industry.  “I’m re-energized about wanting to see more women in
leadership roles within the securities firm,” Irman, 48, said
in an interview. “To be competitive you need to be diverse.
We’ve proven that on the bank side and I think the dealer
community is getting around to that.”  Bank of Montreal Chief Executive Officer William Downe
called Tripp a leader in advancing women in the industry.  “He is an exceptional and influential role model who
understands that there can’t be any debate over the
interpretation of what support of and advancement of women in
capital markets means,” Downe, 61, said in an e-mailed
statement.  Mari Jensen,  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) ’s director of
institutional foreign-exchange sales, received the Rising Star

felt any barriers working there,” Jensen, 39, said in an
interview. “They have been incredibly supportive of my
career.”  Women in Capital Markets, with 1,200 members, promotes the
