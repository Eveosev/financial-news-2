The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index slid 5 basis points to
137 basis points as of 11:08 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. The measure is on course for its lowest
close since Oct. 18, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index fell 5 to 206 as of 9:11 a.m.
in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche Bank AG. The benchmark, which
has ranged from 203 to 209.7 this week, is heading for its third
straight weekly decline, CMA and Deutsche Bank prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 2 to 118 as of 8:09 a.m. in  Hong
Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show. The gauge
has traded between 117.9 and 125.4 this week, according to CMA,
which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
