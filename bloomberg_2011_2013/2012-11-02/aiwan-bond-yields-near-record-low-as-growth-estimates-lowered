Taiwan ’s government bonds had a
second weekly gain, pushing the 10-year yield to a record low,
after the government cut economic growth forecasts as the global
slowdown damps export outlook. The local dollar was steady.  Gross domestic product will rise 1.05 percent this year,
compared with 1.66 percent predicted earlier, the statistics
bureau reported yesterday. Investors are focused on events in
Taiwan’s biggest overseas markets of  China  and the U.S.,
according to Albert Lee, a fixed-income trader at Cathay United
Bank Co. President  Barack Obama  and Republican candidate  Mitt
Romney  face off in presidential elections on Nov. 6, while
China’s 18th Communist Party Congress begins two days later.  “Yields will continue to go down slowly, but we should hit
bottom soon,” said Taipei-based Lee. “It’s going to be an
international events-heavy week. Traders are staying cautious.”  The yield on the 1.125 percent notes due September 2022
fell one basis point this week and was little changed today at
1.132 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. It reached
the low of 1.124 percent yesterday.  Taiwan’s $355 billion economy will expand 3.09 percent in
2013, less than a previous forecast of 3.67 percent, the
statistics bureau said.  The local currency was little changed at NT$29.30 against
the dollar today and this week, data from Taipei Forex Inc.
showed. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, fell 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, to 3.40 percent during the five days.  One-month non-deliverable forwards appreciated 0.2 percent
to NT$29.185 for the week and were steady today, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The  overnight interbank lending  rate
was little changed today and this week at 0.387 percent, a
weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center
shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
