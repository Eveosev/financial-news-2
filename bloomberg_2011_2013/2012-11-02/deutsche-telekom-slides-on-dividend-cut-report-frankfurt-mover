Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ,  Germany ’s
largest phone company, slumped in Frankfurt trading after
Handelsblatt reported that the board may consider sacrificing
some of the dividend after next year to invest in faster network
technology and new products.  The stock dropped as much as 4.2 percent to 8.52 euros, the
lowest level since July 10, according to Bloomberg data.
Deutsche Telekom traded at 8.61 euros as of 12:32 p.m. Trading
had surged to more than 140 percent of the average volume in the
past three months, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Deutsche Telekom, based in Bonn, has been grappling with
faltering demand in European markets amid the sovereign-debt
crisis and customer losses at its U.S. unit after a botched
merger with  AT&T Inc. (T)  last year. The former German monopoly in
August pledged to pay a dividend of at least 70 euro cents (90
cents) for 2012, following payout reductions by competitors
 Telefonica SA (TEF)  and Royal KPN NV.  Andreas Leigers, a Deutsche Telekom spokesman, called the
report, which cited unidentified supervisory-board members,
“speculation.” The phone operator hasn’t indicated how the
dividend will develop after 2012, Leigers said by phone today.  Deutsche Telekom is predicted to leave the dividend at 70
cents through 2014 and increase it to 72 cents in 2015,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
