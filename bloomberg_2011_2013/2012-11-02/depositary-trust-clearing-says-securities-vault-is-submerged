The  Depository Trust & Clearing
Corp. , which processes securities trades in the U.S., said its
vault in southern  Manhattan  is under water.  DTCC, owned by member firms including investment banks,
runs clearinghouses for trading of stocks and bonds. Clearing,
settlement and other processes were “shifted seamlessly” to
facilities outside the region as the hurricane battered the
Northeast, it said.  “As the DTCC vault was sealed prior to evacuating the
building and remains submerged, determining the extent of the
damage would be speculative,” it said in a press release.
“Although sea water levels have returned to normal, the lower
floors in the building remain flooded. Our computer records are
fully intact, including detailed inventory files of the contents
of the vault.”  The organization’s headquarters at 55 Water Street in  New
York  were damaged in Sandy, which flooded parts of southern
Manhattan and cut electricity, it said. DTCC said the building
will be inaccessible until power is restored.  Daily physical processing of securities is being carried
out at a facility in  Brooklyn , the organization said. Deposit
services are available to clients who are able to make delivery
in Brooklyn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
