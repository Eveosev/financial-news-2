The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission asked  Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  to explain its accounting for
coupon refunds and other aspects of its business after the daily
deal site revised 2011 results and disclosed a “material
weakness” in its financial controls.  In  letters  dated Aug. 2 and Sept. 25, the regulator asked
Groupon to disclose more information about refunds, newer types
of coupons for travel and music concerts and its contracts with
local merchants, according to documents made available yesterday
on the SEC’s website.  Groupon has taken steps to improve its financial governance
since March, when it reported fourth-quarter results that were
worse than previously stated because of higher refunds to
merchants, and weakness in its financial controls. The company
bolstered its board with new directors  Daniel Henry , the finance
chief of  American Express Co. (AXP) , and Robert Bass, a former vice
chairman of Deloitte LLP.  Groupon also hired former KPMG LLP executive Brian Stevens
as chief accounting officer.  In its correspondence, the regulator asked Groupon to make
changes to how it reports certain aspects of its business. The
SEC completed its review of Groupon’s filings, it said in
another letter on Oct. 4. The agency didn’t rule out any further
actions in the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
