Penn West Petroleum Ltd. (PWT) , the oil and
natural gas producer that agreed to sell C$1.3 billion ($1.31
billion) in assets last month, fell to the lowest in three years
after a wider-than-expected third-quarter loss.  Penn West dropped 7.2 percent to C$12.09 at the close in
Toronto. The Calgary-based company is down 40 percent this year.  The company reported a loss of C$67 million, or 14 cents a
share, versus a gain of C$138 million, or 29 cents, a year
earlier. The loss was 7 cents larger than the average of four
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Penn West’s production of the equivalent of 160,339 barrels
of oil a day in the quarter was below the “conservative
forecast” of 162,500 barrels by Allan Stepa, a Calgary-based
analyst at Desjardins Securities Inc. The sale of assets
producing about 12,000 barrels a day helped “clean up the
balance sheet,” he said in a note today.  The company announced a plan to boost 2012 spending by
C$100 million to lift its output, though “given its historical
track record of over-promising and under-delivering with respect
to growth targets, we believe investors will continue to take a
wait-and-see approach,” Stepa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
