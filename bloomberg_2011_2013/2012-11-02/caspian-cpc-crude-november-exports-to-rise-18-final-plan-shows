The Caspian Pipeline Consortium,
which operates the only oil export link in Russia with foreign
shareholders, will increase daily crude exports from the  Black
Sea  in November by 18 percent from this month, a final loading
program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  The group, known as CPC, will ship 2.6 million metric tons
compared with 2.3 million tons in October, according to the
schedule. That’s equal to 678,321 barrels a day, up from 576,985
barrels last month.  This compares with 2.5 million tons in the preliminary
schedule released on Oct. 11.  The final program comprises 11 cargoes of 134,000 to
140,000 tons each and 13 consignments of 80,000 to 93,500 tons.  The CPC pipeline, in which  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  is the biggest
corporate shareholder with a 15 percent stake, carries crude
from Kazakhstan’s western fields to a terminal near Russia’s
Novorossiysk port on the Black Sea. Russia owns 31 percent and
Kazakhstan 20.75 percent. Exxon Mobil Corp., OAO Lukoil and a
joint venture between OAO Rosneft and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  are
among the other shareholders.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
