German  government bonds  advanced
after a report showed manufacturing output in the euro-region
contracted in October.  Ten-year bund yields fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.44 percent at 9:03 a.m. London time. Two-
year yields were little changed at 0.02 percent.  A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area fell to
45.4 from 46.1 in September, snapping two months of advances,
London-based Markit Economics said today. That compares with an
initial estimate of 45.3 published on Oct. 24. A reading below
50 indicates contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
