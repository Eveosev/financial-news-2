Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. (HOV) ,  New
Jersey ’s largest homebuilder, said revenue for the quarter that
ended this week should meet or exceed analysts’ estimates even
as superstorm Sandy pushed back the completion of some deals.  Revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter may top the First
Call estimate of $461.1 million from Thomson Reuters Corp., the
Red Bank-based homebuilder said in a statement today. Nine
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg have an average estimate for
revenue of $462.3 million.  Sandy, which battered New Jersey on Oct. 29 in the biggest
storm in Atlantic history, delayed 50 to 75 home deliveries,
Hovnanian said. Closings are typically weighted toward the end
of the quarter and fiscal year, according to the company.  “Since we expect these 50 to 75 homes to be delivered
later in fiscal 2013 and our sales backlog remains very strong,
we do not expect any long-term impact as a result of  Hurricane
Sandy ,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ara K. Hovnanian
said in the statement.  The majority of damage at the company’s communities should
be covered by insurance, Hovnanian said.  Hovnanian climbed 4.9 percent to $4.72 in  New York  trading.
The shares have more than tripled this year for the biggest gain
in the Bloomberg Industries homebuilder  index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
