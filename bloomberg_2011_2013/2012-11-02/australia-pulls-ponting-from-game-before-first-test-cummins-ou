Australia batsman  Ricky Ponting  was
withdrawn from a domestic match because of a hamstring injury
seven days before the national team opens its Test series
against top-ranked  South Africa .  Ponting, 37, was pulled from the Sheffield Shield match
between Tasmania and  South Australia  today as a precaution after
“developing some hamstring soreness during the game,”  Cricket
Australia  said today.  “If this wasn’t a week out from the first Test then Ricky
would continue with the match, but we don’t want to take that
risk,” Pat Howard, Cricket Australia’s general manager of team
performance, said in an e-mailed statement. “We expect Ricky to
be fit for the first Test against South Africa.”  The first of three matches between the teams starts Nov. 9
in Brisbane before the series moves to Adelaide then Perth.  Teenage fast bowler Pat Cummins, meantime, will probably
miss the majority of the 2012-13 season after being diagnosed
with a bone stress injury in his back, Cricket Australia said.  Australia selectors said last week they hoped Cummins, who
took seven wickets in his Test debut for Australia against South
Africa 12 months ago, would be available for the third Test
against the Proteas at the WACA ground.  “We expect he will recover fully from this injury and will
be closely monitored to determine his return to the playing
field,” Australian team physiotherapist  Alex Kountouris  said in
a seperate statement. “We expect that he will miss most of the
2012-13 domestic cricket season.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
