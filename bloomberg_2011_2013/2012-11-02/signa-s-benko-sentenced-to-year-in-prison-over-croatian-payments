Signa Holding GmbH managing director
Rene Benko was found guilty in Vienna of making improper
payments to Croatian officials and sentenced to one year in
prison.  Ernst Schillhammer , a lawyer for the real estate investor,
said his client would appeal the ruling issued by Vienna’s
Economic and Corruption Court.  “The decision is legally and in point of fact false,”
 Schillhammer  said today in a telephone interview.  Benko, who is developing a luxury-retail quarter in Vienna
and had bid for  Germany ’s  Metro AG (MEO) ’s Kaufhof department stores
last year, was alleged to have facilitated an improper payment
to the Croatian officials to help his business in  Italy .  Worth around EU440 million euros ($567 million), Benko was
named Austria’s 2011  Man of the Year  by Trend magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
