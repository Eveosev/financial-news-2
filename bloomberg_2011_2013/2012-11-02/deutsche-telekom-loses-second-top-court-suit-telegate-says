Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , Germany’s
biggest phone company, lost another bid in the country’s top
civil court to overturn a damage award won by  Telegate AG. (TGT)   The Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe backed a lower
court ruling requiring Telekom to pay 50 million euros ($64.4
million), directory service provider Telegate said in an ad hoc
statement today. Telegate won a similar ruling on subscriber
data fees in July awarding it 47.2 million euros, which was
already paid, the company said.  “Telegate AG believes that the ruling of the FCJ confirms
its position that Deutsche Telekom AG has acted in violation of
antitrust laws for years and is liable for such conduct,” the
company said.  Deutsche Telekom has faced numerous complaints over fees
charged for services it provides to competitors as  Germany ’s
former phone monopoly. Directory service providers have sued
Deutsche Telekom over data costs with Telegate founder Klaus
Harisch along seeking as much as 612 million euros.  Andreas Middel, a Deutsche Telekom spokesman, acknowledged
the ruling and declined to comment further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
