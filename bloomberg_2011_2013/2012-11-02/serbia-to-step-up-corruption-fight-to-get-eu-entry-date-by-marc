Serbia will strengthen its criminal
code to step up its fight against corruption in an effort to win
a date to start European Union accession talks by March 2013,
Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic said.  The government will ask parliament this month to adopt “a
corruption-fighting strategy, along with amendments to the
criminal code and criminal procedure code” that are “important
for our internal reforms,” Vucic said in Belgrade today as the
administration marked its first 100 days in power.  Serbia became an EU candidate in March and a date for entry
talks hangs on normalizing ties with  Kosovo , its former province
that unilaterally declared independence in 2008. Fighting graft
may help Serbia by March, Vucic said.  Vucic, who is also the defense minister and coordinator of
intelligence services, has repeatedly named Serbia’s top
businessmen of being behind efforts to thwart his plan to
eradicate corruption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
