CEZ AS (CEZ)  asked Energeticky a Prumyslovy
Holding AS and Czech Coal AS to resubmit bids for two coal-fired
plants that the largest Czech power producer is selling after a
European Union antitrust investigation into its operations.  The offers for the Pocerady and Chvaletice plants werenâ€™t
complete, said Ladislav Kriz, a spokesman. The utility, which
rejected earlier bids that expired Oct. 31, is seeking offers
valid until the year-end, Kriz said in an interview in Prague.  The European Commission said last year that CEZ may have
stopped rivals entering the market by hoarding transmission-
network capacity. The company offered to sell a plant to end the
EU probe into the allegations, the commission said in July 2012.
The utility is also seeking bids for its Detmarovice plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
