Coach Inc. (COH) , the largest U.S. luxury
handbag maker, said it won a $257 million default judgment in a
lawsuit filed against businesses that operate websites selling
counterfeit merchandise.  The judgment also awards Coach ownership of 573 Internet
domain names, the company said today in a statement. The docket
in the case, filed in federal court in  Chicago , shows that the
decision was rendered Oct. 15.  “This judgment should serve as a warning to everyone
involved in any aspect of trafficking in counterfeit goods that
Coach will find you and will seek to impose the harshest
penalties available against you,” Coach’s general counsel, Todd
Kahn, said in the statement.  The judgment is the latest victory in Coach’s anti-
counterfeiting campaign known as “Operation Turnlock,” the
company said. Since the program’s inception in 2009, Coach has
obtained monetary awards against manufacturers, wholesalers,
flea market operators and other links in the counterfeit
distribution chain, the New York-based company said.  The case is Coach Inc. v. Does 1-573, 12-cv-01514,  U.S.
District Court, Northern District of  Illinois  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
