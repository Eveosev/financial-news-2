Crude oil options volatility rose for
a third day as the underlying futures declined on speculation
that refinery closings caused by  Hurricane Sandy  will add to
inventories.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
December, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 30.47 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 3:10 p.m., up from 29.66 yesterday.  December-delivery crude oil fell $2.23, or 2.6 percent, to
settle at $84.86 a barrel on the Nymex. Crews at Phillips 66’s
Bayway refinery and  Hess Corp. (HES) ’s Port Reading plant are
assessing equipment after shutting Oct. 29 ahead of Sandy, the
companies said. Oil inventories exceeded 370 million barrels
last week, the most for this time of year in at least 30 years.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
December $80 puts, which gained 23 cents to 42 cents on volume
of 3,309 lots at 3:21 p.m. December $83 puts were the second-
most active, with 2,852 lots exchanged as they advanced 55 cents
to $1.09 a barrel.  Puts accounted for 55 percent of the 52,379 lots traded.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, calls made up 54 percent of the
88,722 contracts traded.  December $80 puts were the most actively traded options
yesterday with 5,426 contracts. They fell 16 cents to 19 cents a
barrel. December $90 calls rose 8 cents to 67 cents on volume of
4,402 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
68,164 contracts. Next were December $125 calls with 46,013 lots
