Manchester United manager  Alex Ferguson  said he doesn’t believe referee Mark Clattenburg would
direct a racial insult at a player.  The Football Association and  London  police are
investigating an allegation that Clattenburg used
“inappropriate language” toward Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel during the Premier League leader’s 3-2 loss to United at
 Stamford  Bridge on Oct. 28.  Chelsea has submitted evidence to the F.A. including
interviews with players and staff. The Sun reported that two
Chelsea players said they heard Clattenburg, who is white,
racially abuse Mikel, who is black. The referee denies the
accusation, according to the newspaper.  “I don’t believe Mark Clattenburg would make any comments
like that. I refuse to believe it,” Ferguson said at a news
conference before of tomorrow’s match against Arsenal. “I think
it is unthinkable in the modern climate. There is no way a
referee would stoop to that, I am convinced of that.”  Chelsea manager Roberto  Di Matteo  wouldn’t comment on the
case at his news conference today, citing the investigation. He
said he didn’t expect his club to face a backlash from match
officials.  “We have faith in the referees,” Di Matteo said. “They
are people that are under a lot of pressure and they’re human
beings like everyone else.”  Chelsea, which tops the Premier League by one point over
United and Manchester City, visits Swansea tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
