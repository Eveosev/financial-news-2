German stocks  climbed for a second
day as a report showed that the  U.S. economy  created more jobs
last month than estimated.  Beiersdorf AG (BEI)  surged 7.2 percent as the company raised its
forecast for sales growth this year.  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) 
climbed 2.7 percent.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  fell 1 percent as it will
have to increase its  capital requirements .  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) 
dropped 2.6 percent after a report said it may cut its dividend
after next year by as much as a third.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  added 0.4 percent to 7,363.85 at the close of
trading in Frankfurt. The equity benchmark has  rallied 23
percent  from this year’s low on June 5 as the  European Central
Bank  approved an unlimited bond-buying program and the U.S.
Federal Reserve started a third round of asset purchases. The
broader HDAX Index also climbed 0.4 percent today.  “The headline number is better than expected,” said
Jeremy Batstone-Carr, head of research at Charles Stanley Group
Plc in  London . “Algorithms have been woken from their torpor
and jolted upwards. The jobless rate remains below the 8 percent
level, seen as a watershed by some.”  U.S. non-farm payrolls climbed by 171,000 in October, from
a revised 148,000 in September, according to a release from the
Labor Department. The median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey had called for an increase of 125,000.  The report also showed that private payrolls, which exclude
government jobs, climbed by 184,000 last month, following a
revised 128,000 gain in September. The median economist forecast
had called for an increase of 123,000.  Beiersdorf Forecast  Beiersdorf surged 7.2 percent to 60.70 euros as the maker
of Nivea skin cream raised its  forecast for sales growth  after
reporting third-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  Full-year revenue will increase as much as 4 percent,
Hamburg-based Beiersdorf said today, compared with a previous
forecast of about 3 percent. Adjusted earnings before interest
and taxes rose 30 percent to 185 million euros ($238 million) in
the third quarter, exceeding the 170.2 million-euro  average of
11 analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  BMW, the largest manufacturer of luxury cars, advanced 2.7
percent to 65 euros.  Continental AG (CON) ,  Europe’s second-largest auto-parts maker ,
rose 1.4 percent to 78.91 euros. A gauge of carmakers climbed
1.2 percent.  Henkel, Siemens  Henkel AG, the Dusseldorf-based maker of Persil detergent,
increased 3.5 percent to 63.65 euros.  Siemens AG gained 1.5 percent to 79.56 euros.  Europe’s
biggest engineering company  will reach the low end of its full-
year earnings target when it reports its financial results next
week, Handelsblatt reported, citing unidentified people familiar
with the figures. The company had cautioned that meeting the
target would be difficult.  Deutsche Bank lost 1 percent to 35.62 euros.  Germany ’s
largest lender will have to set aside a capital surcharge of 2.5
percent, according to an updated list published late yesterday
by the Financial Stability Board.  Deutsche Telekom dropped 2.6 percent to 8.66 euros.
 Europe’s second-largest telecommunications company  may reduce
its dividend, Handelsblatt reported, citing unidentified
supervisory board members. The cut would give Chief Executive
Officer Rene Obermann more leeway to invest in faster networks
and products, according to the report.  Fraport AG slipped 3.4 percent to 44.68 euros as the stock
was cut to underperform from buy at Bank of America Corp.,
meaning that investors should sell the shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
