China ’s money-market rate was set for
a weekly decline on speculation the central bank’s record
capital injection this month will help increase cash supply.  The People’s Bank of China  pumped  a net 379 billion  yuan 
($60.7 billion) into the financial system this week, the most
since Bloomberg started compiling the data in 2008. The central
bank kept the yields on seven-, 14- and 28-day reverse-
repurchase contracts unchanged at 3.35, 3.45 and 3.6 percent,
respectively, in so-called open-market operations.  “PBOC’s capital injection helped meet surging cash demand
around the end of October,” said Liu Junyu, a bond analyst at
China Merchants Bank Co. in Shenzhen, the nation’s sixth biggest
lender. “The seven-day repo rate probably won’t fall further
because the central bank has refrained from lowering reverse-
repo rates, showing its reluctance to push borrowing costs even
lower.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 35 basis points, or 0.35
percentage point, in the week to 3.37 percent as of 4:30 p.m. in
 Shanghai , according to a weighted average rate compiled by the
National Interbank Funding Center. The rate fell six basis
points today.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, climbed four
basis points this week to 3.25 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The rate gained five basis points today.  The yield on the 2.95 percent government bond due January
2021 dropped eight basis points this week to 3.15 percent,
according to the Interbank Funding Center. The yield slid seven
basis points today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
