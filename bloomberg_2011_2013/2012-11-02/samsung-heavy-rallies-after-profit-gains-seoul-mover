Samsung Heavy Industries Co. (010140) , the
world’s second-largest shipyard, rallied the most in eight
months in Seoul trading after third-quarter profit exceeded
analysts’ estimates.  The stock climbed 6.1 percent to 34,700 won at the close on
the Korea Exchange, its steepest gain since Feb. 28. The
benchmark  Kospi index  added 1.1 percent.  Samsung Heavy reported a net income of 277.4 billion won
($254 million) in the quarter ended Sept. 30, the company said
in a filing yesterday after the market closed. That topped the
180.6 billion won  average  of 23 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. A rebound in the liquefied-natural-gas ship market
may drive new orders, according to Tong Yang Securities Inc.  “The company’s profit margin is the highest within the
industry, aided by its flagship drill ships that account for 30
to 40 percent of its revenue,” Lee Jae Won, an analyst at Tong
Yang Securities, wrote in a note today. “Industry fundamentals
appear to be in better shape than previously thought.”  The stock was upgraded to buy from outperform at Daiwa
Securities Group Inc., which said in a note that the company
will likely lead its peers in fourth-quarter orders.  Samsung Heavy shares  have  surged 24 percent this year,
outpacing a 5.1 percent advance in the Kospi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
