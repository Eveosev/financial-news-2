Commerzbank AG raised its forecasts
for the euro against the dollar through December 2013, saying
the projected weakness in the 17-nation currency will come later
than it previously forecast.  The  European Central Bank ’s “announcement of unlimited
bond purchases has calmed the markets to a wider extent over the
past few weeks than we had expected,” Frankfurt-based analysts
Ulrich Leuchtmann and  Ralph Solveen  wrote in a note to clients.
“The euro weakness which we are projecting is therefore likely
to occur later.”  Commerzbank estimates the euro will rise to $1.30 by
December this year, up from a previous forecast of $1.23,
according to the note. The currency will trade at $1.23 by the
end of 2013, from a previous estimate of $1.16, the report said.  The euro dropped 0.5 percent to $1.2885 at 12:03 p.m.
London time after falling to $1.2865, the weakest level since
Oct. 11. The common currency has weakened 0.6 percent this year.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  on Sept. 6 announced details of
the central bank’s plan to purchase unlimited quantities of the
government bonds of nations requesting aid to help contain the
region’s debt crisis.  “Contrary to previous expectations we now foresee euro-
dollar to move sideways until the spring,” Leuchtmann and
Solveen wrote. “However we stick to our view of a notably
weaker euro for the time after that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
