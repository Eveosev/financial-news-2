Calgon Carbon Corp. (CCC) , a Pittsburgh-
based water-purification company, reported a third-quarter loss
of $4.5 million including a restructuring charge compared with
net income of $14.5 million a year earlier.  The $8 million restructuring charge stemmed from a
previously announced cost-reduction program that included
closing a manufacturing facility in Datong,  China , and severance
payments, the company said today in a statement.  Sales for the quarter were $135.5 million, a 5.6 percent
decrease from a year ago due mostly to lower demand for
activated carbon in the municipal drinking water, environmental
air and wastewater markets, Calgon Carbon said.  Equipment sales climbed almost 58 percent in the quarter,
buoyed by ballast water treatment systems, it said. The shares
climbed as much as 4.6 percent today, the most in three months,
trimming the stockâ€™s decline this year to 17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
