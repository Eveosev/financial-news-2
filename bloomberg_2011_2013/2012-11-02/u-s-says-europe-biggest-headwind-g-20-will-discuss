A U.S.  Treasury  Department official
said the European crisis remains the strongest headwind to world
economic growth and will be discussed at the  Group of 20  nations
meetings, along with President  Barack Obama ’s fiscal plan.  The official, who briefed reporters before the G-20
sessions on Nov. 4-5 in Mexico City, also said that Greece and
its  international creditors  appear to be close to an agreement.  The G-20 meetings of finance ministers and central bankers
will start two days before the  U.S. presidential election . The
U.S. delegation will be headed by Treasury Undersecretary for
International Affairs Lael Brainard.  The Obama administration hopes that Congress will move
quickly to act on the president’s deficit- and debt-reduction
plan, the Treasury official said today in response to questions
about the so-called fiscal cliff.  “Fiscal cliff” refers to the more than $600 billion of
federal spending cuts and tax increases that will automatically
take effect at the start of next year unless Congress acts.  Hitting the cliff would probably reverse U.S. economic
growth and put the world’s largest economy back into recession,
the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office  said on Aug. 22.  The Treasury official also said  China  has further to go in
achieving a market-oriented  exchange rate , while the nation’s
recent slowdown shows that domestic consumption still has some
distance to go in driving China’s growth.  The official briefed reporters on condition of not being
further identified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
