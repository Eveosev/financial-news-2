Thailand ’s government  bonds  headed
for a sixth weekly advance, the longest stretch in a year, as
global funds boosted holdings amid speculation the central bank
will lower borrowing costs. The baht rose.  Inflation  slowed  last month to 3.32 percent from 3.38
percent in September, official data showed yesterday, even as
the Bank of Thailand unexpectedly cut its policy rate by a
quarter of a percentage point to 2.75 percent. International
investors bought $481 million more sovereign debt than they sold
this week through yesterday after the central bank lowered its
2013 growth forecast to 4.6 percent on Oct. 26 from a previous
estimate of 5 percent.  “Funds are flowing into  Asia  recently amid improving risk
sentiment,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan
Center for  Economic Research  in Tokyo. “In Thailand, bonds
attract more funds than stocks especially as they just cut rates
while economic outlooks remain weak.”  The yield on the 3.625 percent notes due May 2015 fell
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, this week to 2.86
percent as of 8:39 a.m. in Bangkok,  according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The rate, unchanged from yesterday, was the lowest
since Dec. 14, 2011. The Bank of Thailand will next review
monetary policy on Nov. 28.  The baht, little changed today, rose 0.1 percent this week
to 30.73 per dollar, halting a three-week decline, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, was
unchanged today and this week at 4.27 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
