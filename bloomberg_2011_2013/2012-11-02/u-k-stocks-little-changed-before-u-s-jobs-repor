The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  closed
little changed, following yesterday’s biggest rally for the
equity benchmark in a month.  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  gained 2.7 percent after JPMorgan Chase &
Co. recommended investors buy the energy producer.  Bumi Plc (BUMI) 
surged 14 percent after Nathaniel Rothschild was said to form a
group to counter a $1.2 billion buyout offer.  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  fell 2.1 percent after posting a loss.  The FTSE 100 rose 6.63 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,868.55
at the close in London after surging 1.4 percent yesterday. The
gauge rose as much as 0.5 percent earlier today after a U.S.
jobs report beat economists’ forecasts. The FTSE All-Share Index
also added 0.1 percent. Ireland’s ISEQ Index gained 0.9 percent.  “While we did see a rally immediately following the
release of the U.S. jobs data, this slowed quite quickly as
people began closing their positions before the presidential
elections,” said Craig Erlam, a market analyst at Alpari U.K.
Ltd. in  London . “We’re likely to see a very risk-averse
approach to the markets at the start of next week.”  The FTSE 100 has still advanced 1.1 percent this week,
extending its  advance from its June 1 low  to 12 percent, as
companies reported better-than-estimated earnings and U.S.
manufacturing and private-payrolls reports bolstered confidence
in America’s economy.  The last jobs report before the U.S. election on Nov. 6
showed that the world’s largest economy added a net 171,000
workers to payrolls in October. Employers created 148,000 jobs
in September, more than was first estimated, today’s Labor
Department release showed.  The median forecast of 91 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
had called for an advance of 125,000 last month. The
 unemployment rate  rose to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent.  Trading Volumes  The number of shares changing hands in FTSE 100 companies
was 19 percent greater than the 30-day average, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Volumes were lower than usual for
the first two days of this week as  Hurricane Sandy  shut U.S.
equity markets.  Tullow Oil climbed 2.7 percent to 1,445 pence after
JPMorgan raised its recommendation for the shares to overweight
from neutral, the equivalent of a buy rating.  Bumi surged 14 percent to 283 pence after a person familiar
with the matter said that Rothschild will form a group to
counter the Bakrie family’s buyout offer for the Indonesian
mining company.  Rothschild, who resigned from Bumi’s board last month, has
held talks with potential partners and the  company’s existing
shareholders  to fend off the buyout offer, said the person, who
requested anonymity because the discussions are private.  RBS Slips  RBS dropped 2.1 percent to 281.3 pence, paring yesterday’s
4.1 percent rally. Britain’s biggest taxpayer-owned lender today
reported a 1.38 billion-pound ($2.2 billion)  loss in the third
quarter  after setting aside an additional 400 million pounds to
compensate customers who were wrongly sold loan insurance.  That compared with a 1.23 billion-pound profit in the year-
earlier period and the  median analyst estimate  of 276 million
pounds, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Today’s provision brings the total RBS has set aside for
mis-selling to 1.7 billion pounds.  Admiral Slides  Admiral Group Plc (ADM)  posted the biggest decline on the FTSE
100 today, falling 5.3 percent to 1,081 pence after the company,
which insures 3.6 million British vehicles, reported a 2 percent
drop in third-quarter revenue to 570 million pounds.  “The U.K. car insurance market is cyclical and we are in
the softer part of the cycle, with premium rates coming down,”
said Henry Engelhardt, Admiral’s CEO. “We believe that the
sensible strategy in this part of the cycle is to slow our rate
of growth.”  The shares had advanced 4.4 percent over the previous three
trading days.  Direct Line Insurance Group Plc (DLG)  lost 1.9 percent to 195.25
pence. The U.K.’s biggest home and motor insurer reported a 4
percent drop in operating profit for the third quarter to 123.7
million pounds.  Debenhams Plc (DEB)  dropped 3 percent to 120 pence after Bank of
America Corp. sold 30 million of the department-store retailer’s
shares at 119 pence apiece on behalf of a client, according to a
person familiar with the transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
