Mitsui Fudosan Co. (8801) ,  Japan ’s biggest
developer by sales, rose to the highest since March 2011 after
saying fiscal first-half profit gained 62 percent after opening
two shopping centers in Tokyo and as home sales improved.  The shares gained 3.9 percent to 1,717 yen at the close in
Tokyo, the  highest  since March 1, 2011.  Net income gained to 26.9 billion yen ($336 million) in the
six months ended Sept. 30 from 16.6 billion yen a year earlier,
the Tokyo-based developer said yesterday after the market close.
Sales rose 7.4 percent to 615.7 billion yen from the same period
a year ago, it said.  “Mitsui Fudosan’s first-half results indicate that
profitability is improving,” said  Masahiro Mochizuki , an
analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, in a report yesterday. “We
expect the property sales segment profits to rise on greater
contributions from condo sales and sales to investors.”  Mitsui Fudosan’s leasing profit gained 11 percent after the
opening of Mitsui Outlet Park Kisarazu and DiverCity, both
located in Tokyo Bay. The developer’s home sales business had a
profit of 6.8 billion yen for the period, compared with a loss
of 790 million for the same period a year earlier.  Mitsui Fudosan, which increased its profit for the first
time in three years last fiscal year, is expecting profit to
rise 9.7 percent in the current year ending March 2013.  To contact the reporters on this story:
