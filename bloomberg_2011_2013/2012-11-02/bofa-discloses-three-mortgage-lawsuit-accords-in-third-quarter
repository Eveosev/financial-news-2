Bank of America Corp. , the second-
largest U.S. bank, settled three cases where mortgage bond
investors accused the lender of misrepresenting the quality of
loans within the securities.  The firm settled suits with Dexia SA, Sealink Funding Ltd.
and Bayerische Landesbank, Germany’s second-biggest state-owned
lender, on Sept. 27,  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of
America said today in a regulatory  filing . The firm didn’t
disclose the amounts it paid.  Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan , 53, has spent
more than $40 billion to clean up defective mortgages and
improper foreclosures. The third-quarter settlements mean a suit
from insurer  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  is one of the
firm’s remaining major disputes over mortgage securities.  “We’ve been chipping away at this, we settled a group of
them this quarter,” Moynihan told  employees  in an Oct. 17 town
hall meeting. “You should expect that if people are reasonable,
over a period of time,” more accords will be reached.  The lender also said it could have as much as $2.8 billion
in legal costs as of Sept. 30 beyond what it has already set
aside. That’s a decline from the $4.1 billion estimated three
months earlier because of a settlement of a class-action suit
tied to the 2009 takeover of Merrill Lynch & Co., said  Jerry
Dubrowski , a Bank of America spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
