Enzo Biochem Inc. was awarded $48.6
million after a federal jury said  Life Technologies Corp. (LIFE) ’s
Applera unit infringed a patent over a way to detect genetic
sequences and diagnose human diseases such as cancer.  The federal jury in  New Haven ,  Connecticut , rejected
Applera’s claims that the patent was invalid. Enzo said it will
ask for interest that could add tens of millions of dollars to
the final damage award.  The suit was first filed in 2004 by New York-based Enzo and
 Yale University . They were demanding royalties on Life’s genetic
research and screening. The trial focused on Applera’s
dRhodamine and BigDye Terminator products used to sequence DNA.
The patent, issued in 1995, has since expired.  Enzo said the verdict could help it resolve cases it filed
against other companies including Amersham Plc, Life’s Molecular
Probes and Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings’ Orchid
Cellmark.  “The technologies subject to the litigation helped pave
the way for major developments in important areas in biological
science and medicine,” Enzo Chief Executive Officer Elazar Rabbani said in a statement. “The case has taken eight years,
but we have finally prevailed. It is a vindication of the
investments we have made in developing and protecting our
intellectual property.”  U.S. District Judge Janet Bond Arterton, who presided over
the trial, in 2007 invalidated the patent, only to have it
revived by an appeals court.  The case is  Enzo Biochem Inc. (ENZ)  v. Applera Corp., 04-cv-929,
U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut (New Haven).  To contact the reporter on this story:
