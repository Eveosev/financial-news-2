DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS) , Southeast
Asia’s largest bank, plans to sell more services to wealthy
people in  Hong Kong  to grow consumer banking revenue by at least
10 percent a year in the city.  DBS forecasts growth at that pace for “the near future,”
Pearlyn Phau, head of consumer banking for Hong Kong, said in an
interview yesterday. Revenue in the first nine months rose 14
percent from a year earlier, including 17 percent growth from
 wealth management , she said.  The expansion is part of Chief Executive Officer  Piyush
Gupta ’s strategy of selling services to rich Asians to weather
waning corporate demand as the economy slows in its home market
of Singapore. DBS last year said it would invest S$250 million
($205 million) to build that business in Asia.  “In the last year, a lot of the efforts that we’ve put in,
and going into the next few years, will really be shifted
towards servicing the affluent customer base,” Phau said.  The Hong Kong unit aims to expand wealth management
revenue, derived from services including selling bonds and
funds, to account for one-third of its consumer banking income
in the next two years, said Phau, who looks after clients with
investable assets of HK$1 million to HK$25 million. She declined
to disclose the current size of the business.  DBS last year  started  targeting individuals with HK$8
million of investable assets or more. That’s an extension of its
private banking operation, which caters to customers with more
than HK$25 million each.  To contact the reporter on this story:
