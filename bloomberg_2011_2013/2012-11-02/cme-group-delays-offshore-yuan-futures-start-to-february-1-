CME Group Inc. (CME) , owner of the world’s
biggest futures exchange, delayed the introduction of
deliverable forwards for offshore  yuan  to Feb. 25 from the
fourth quarter, saying clients asked for more time to prepare.  “We’ve got a lot of interest from players and a lot of
them are very keen, but obviously setting up  renminbi  accounts
takes some time,” KC Lam, CME’s Singapore-based head of
foreign-exchange for Asia, said in an interview today. “They
came back to us requesting more time to set that up.” Lam said
in a Sept. 13 interview that CME planned to start offering the
offshore yuan contracts in the fourth quarter.  The move will put it five months behind  Hong Kong Exchanges
& Clearing Ltd. (388) , which started the trading of similar contracts
on Sept. 17. China is the world’s No. 1 exporter and People’s
Bank of China Deputy Governor Yi Gang said last month the nation
has removed barriers for using the yuan for trading or
investment partners who want to use the currency.  Hong Kong  Exchanges set the standard contract size for
offshore yuan futures at $100,000 each with tenors of up to one
year and trading from 9 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. local time. Chicago-
based CME will have similar-sized contracts of up to three years
as well as $10,000 futures with maturities of no more than 12
months, Lam said.  The yuan has strengthened 0.8 percent against the greenback
this year to 6.2419 per dollar as of 1:28 p.m. in Shanghai,
according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards slipped 0.05 percent to
6.3555 in Hong Kong, a 1.8 percent discount to the onshore spot
rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
