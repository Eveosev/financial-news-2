U.S. natural gas production fell in
August as Hurricane Isaac prompted evacuations from platforms
and rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, the Energy Department said.  Output decreased 3.4 percent to 76.6 billion cubic feet a
day from a revised 79.33 billion in July, the department’s
Energy Information Administration said in the monthly  EIA-914
report , released today in  Washington . It was the third straight
drop.  The biggest declines were in  Louisiana  and the Gulf “as
many operators reported shut-ins due to Hurricane Isaac,” the
department said.  Production in the lower-48 states dropped 0.2 percent to
72.55 billion cubic feet a day from a revised 72.66 billion in
July. Gulf output slid 9.5 percent to 3.7 billion cubic feet a
day. Louisiana supplies fell 1.9 percent to 8.31 billion cubic
feet a day from a revised 8.47 billion.  Oklahoma output slipped 0.4 percent to 5.48 billion versus
the prior month. New Mexico declined 0.3 percent to 3.6 billion
while  Wyoming  dropped 2.1 percent to 5.97 billion.  Texas Gas  Output in  Texas , the biggest producing state, gained 1
percent to 22.41 billion cubic feet a day from a revised 22.18
billion. Supplies from the “other states” category, including
gas in the Marcellus shale formation, rose 1.6 percent to 23.08
billion cubic feet a day from a revised 22.71 billion in July.  The increases “can be explained by new wells coming online
in several shale plays,” the department said.  Natural gas futures in August dropped 41 cents, or 13
percent, to $2.799 per million British thermal units on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. December futures today fell 13.6
cents, or 3.7 percent, to $3.563 per million British thermal
units at 12:39 p.m. Gas is down 4.9 percent from a year ago.  The EIA-914 report covers gas gross withdrawals, which
include gas used for repressuring, quantities vented and flared,
and non-hydrocarbon gas removed in treating or processing
operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
