First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  and  SunPower (SPWR)  Corp.,
the largest U.S. solar manufacturers, fell the most in at least
four weeks after third-quarter sales slumped.  First Solar declined 8.9 percent to $22.54 at the close in
New York, the most since Oct. 5. SunPower slid 7.9 percent, the
most since Aug. 30.  First Solar’s sales slumped 17 percent to $839 million from
a year earlier as the Tempe, Arizona-based company completed or
slowed construction on some large U.S. solar farms, according to
a statement yesterday. SunPower, majority owned by  Total SA (FP) ,
said sales declined 8 percent to $649 million, mainly due to
lower shipments in several European markets.  First Solar lowered its 2012 sales forecast to $3.5 billion
to $3.8 billion, from its August forecast of $3.6 billion to
$3.9 billion.  San Jose , California-based SunPower expects
fourth-quarter sales of $650 million to $850 million, and
neither company provided information about next year.  “Neither one of them had much specific about 2013,”
Robert Stone, an analyst at Cowen & Co. in Boston, said in an
interview today. “You didn’t even get a rough outline of what
next year looks like and there’s lots of reasons to be
uncertain,” including continuing slow demand in Europe and
questions about U.S. incentive programs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
