Hong Kong  shares  rose, with an equity
gauge of mainland companies entering a  bull market , after U.S.
employment and manufacturing data beat estimates and  consumer
confidence  rose, adding to signs the world’s largest economy is
weathering a global slowdown.  Man Wah Holdings, a furniture maker that gets 51 percent of
its sales in the U.S., gained 1.5 percent. Hengdeli Holdings
Ltd. led retailers higher on a report that Hong Kong sales grew
in September.  Sands China Ltd. (1928) , the Macau casino operator
controlled by billionaire  Sheldon Adelson , gained 6.3 percent
after third-quarter profit rose.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland
companies, also known as the H-share index, added 1.2 percent to
10,833.73 at close of trading in Hong Kong. The measure is up
more than 20 percent from a Sept. 5 low, indicating the start of
a bull market. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 1.3 percent
to 22,111.33, its highest since August 2011, rising 2.6 percent
this week. Trading volume on the gauge was 19 percent above the
30-day average.  “There were certainly some slightly more encouraging signs
with respect to data points,” said Peter Elston, Singapore-
based head of Asia-Pacific strategy at Aberdeen Asset
Management, which oversees about $270 billion. “It seems we
have an interesting battle going on between weakening
fundamentals and a deteriorating profit picture on one hand and
very supportive monetary policy on the other.”  China Rally  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  has rallied on
speculation the nation’s economy may be stabilizing and as
central banks across the globe add stimulus to prop up growth.
The 40-member gauge  traded  at nine times average estimated
earnings, compared with 13.7 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
and 12.3 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  China’s central bank cut  interest rates  in June and July
for the first time since 2008 and reduced banks’ reserve
requirements three times since November to boost the economy.  Futures on the  S&P 500  were little changed today after the
index gained 1.1 percent yesterday after private report showed
U.S. payrolls expanded in October and as the Institute for
Supply Management’s U.S. factory index rose from a month

percent to HK$4.84.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and

October, and the jobless rate increased to 7.9 percent from a

biggest advance since Aug. 22. Apparel-maker Ports Design Ltd.
