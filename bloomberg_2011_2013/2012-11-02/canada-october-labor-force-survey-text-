Following is the text of  Canada ’s
labor force survey released by  Statistics Canada .  Following two consecutive months of increases, employment
in October was unchanged and the unemployment rate remained at
7.4%.  Compared with 12 months earlier, employment increased 1.3%
or 229,000, all in full-time work. The total number of hours
worked also rose 1.3% over the same period.  In October, employment grew in Quebec and Newfoundland and
Labrador, while it fell in British Columbia and Manitoba. There
was little change in the other provinces.  The number of public sector employees increased by 37,000,
offset by a decline in private sector employment, which includes
both private sector employees and the self-employed. Total gains
over the previous 12 months were among both private sector
employees (+157,000 or +1.4%) and public sector employees
(+74,000 or +2.1%).  Employment in agriculture experienced a decline in October,
while there was little change in the other industries.  The number of workers among the major demographic groups
was virtually unchanged in October.  Provincial summary  Employment in  Quebec  increased by 20,000 in October, all in
part-time work, pushing the unemployment rate down 0.3
percentage points to 7.7%. Compared with 12 months earlier,
employment in the province was 1.7% higher.  In October, employment in Newfoundland and Labrador rose by
3,800, and the unemployment rate was 11.9%. Employment in the
province increased 3.6% from 12 months earlier, the highest
growth rate among the provinces.  The number of workers in British Columbia declined by
11,000 in October. Nevertheless, the unemployment rate fell 0.3
percentage points to 6.7%, as fewer people participated in the
labour force. Year-over-year employment growth for the province
was 1.3%.  Following two consecutive months of increases, employment
in Manitoba fell by 7,300 in October, and the unemployment rate
rose 0.6 percentage points to 5.6%. Despite this increase,
Manitoba continued to have one of the lowest unemployment rates
among the provinces. Compared with 12 months earlier, there was
little change in overall employment.  In October, employment in Ontario was little changed, as a
decrease in part-time work was mostly offset by an increase in
full-time work. The unemployment rate rose 0.4 percentage points
to 8.3%, as more people searched for work. Compared with 12
months earlier, employment growth in the province was 1.0%.  While employment in  New Brunswick  was little changed in
October, the unemployment rate increased 0.6 percentage points
to 11.6%, with more people searching for work. Compared with 12
months earlier, the unemployment rate in the province was up 2.2
percentage points.  Employment losses in agriculture  Following an increase in September, employment in
agriculture fell by 16,000 in October. Employment in this
industry was little changed compared with 12 months earlier.  The number of workers in manufacturing was little changed
for the fifth consecutive month. Compared with 12 months earlier,
the number of factory workers increased 5.2%, with most of the
gains earlier in the year.  Little employment change among the major demographic groups  In October, employment among men aged 55 and over was
little changed. However, with more men in this age group
searching for work, the unemployment rate increased 1.0
percentage points to 7.3%. Compared with 12 months earlier,
employment among this group was up 87,000 (+5.1%), partly as a
result of population aging.  Employment among women aged 55 and over was little changed
in October. Compared with 12 months earlier, their employment
increased by 102,000 (+7.4%), also partly a result of population
aging.  Employment among those aged 25 to 54 was unchanged in
October, and the year-over-year gains were 92,000 (+0.8%).  Employment among youths was little changed for the second
consecutive month and was down by 52,000 (-2.1%) compared with
12 months earlier. Their unemployment rate was 14.7% in October.  Note to readers  The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability.
Estimates for smaller geographic areas or industries will have
more variability. For an explanation of sampling variability of
estimates and how to use standard errors to assess this
variability, consult the “Data quality” section of the
publication Labour Force Information (71-001-X, free).  The employment rate is the number of employed persons as a
percentage of the population 15 years of age and over. The rate
for a particular group (for example, youth aged 15 to 24) is the
number employed in that group as a percentage of the population
for that group.  The unemployment rate is the number unemployed as a
percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed).  The participation rate is the number of employed and
unemployed as a percentage of the population. For more detailed
information, see the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (71-543-G,
free).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally
adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by removing the
effects of seasonal variations. For more information on seasonal
adjustment, see Seasonal adjustment and identifying economic
trends ( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-010-x/2010003/part -
