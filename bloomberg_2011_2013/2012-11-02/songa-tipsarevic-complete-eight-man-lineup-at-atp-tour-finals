Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Janko Tipsarevic completed the lineup at next week’s season-ending ATP
World Tour Finals in London after they advanced to the
quarterfinals of the Paris Masters.  Tsonga of France and Serbia’s Tipsarevic, ranked seventh
and ninth in the world respectively, join Novak Djokovic,  Roger Federer , Andy Murray,  David Ferrer ,  Tomas Berdych  and Juan Martin del Potro in the eight-man singles field.  “It’s really important for me to have qualified,” Tsonga,
the runner-up to Federer last year, said in comments released by
the ATP. “With the big four at the moment, it’s not easy to get
rewards in tennis, so for me this is one of my rewards. It feels
good to be a part of it.”  The Tour Finals, which have a prize pool of $5.5. million,
are scheduled Nov. 5-12 at London’s O2 arena.  Organizers said yesterday that 11 of the 15 sessions for
the tournament, which also features the top eight doubles teams,
have sold out. The event is about 6,000 tickets away from
selling all 262,000 seats for the first time since moving to the
U.K. capital from  Shanghai  in 2009, according to Chris Kermode,
the tournament’s managing director.  Federer of Switzerland won the singles title last year for
a record sixth time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
