Polish power for Saturday slumped to
its lowest for almost five months as flows to Germany, the  Czech
Republic  and Slovakia were forecast to fall.  The  Polish day-ahead  contract dropped 11 percent from a
week ago to 158.41 zloty ($49.51) a megawatt-hour, the lowest
since June 9, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg.  Electricity flows from Poland were forecast to decline to
zero during some hours tomorrow compared with exports of as much
as 1,007 megawatts to Germany at 7 p.m. today,  data  from grid
manager PSE Operator SA showed.  PGE SA (PGE)  had an unplanned halt of a 232-megawatt plant at its
coal-fed Dolna Odra facility. A 261-megawatt unit at the
company’s Turow and a 386-megawatt generator at its Opole power
station halted for maintenance today. The Turow plant is
scheduled to start Nov. 7 and the Opole one on Dec. 18, the
company said on its website.  Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE)  halted a 225-megawatt unit at its
Laziska plant for maintenance until Dec. 13, the utility said on
its website.  Next-day electricity in the Czech Republic added 1.5
percent to 34.05 ($43.73). The contract rose 1.6 percent to
34.11 euros in Slovakia and climbed 2.7 percent to 34.47 euros a
megawatt-hour in  Hungary , according to the countries’ market
