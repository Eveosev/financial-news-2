Croatia  will raise excise taxes on
tobacco products after it joins the European Union in July,
Finance Minister Slavko Linic said.  “The current excise duties on tobacco are much lower than
in the EU, so from July tobacco will be more expensive,” Linic
told reporters today in Zagreb, the capital. He gave no
specifics on the size of the planned increases.  The Adriatic Sea nation is set to join the bloc on July 1,
2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
