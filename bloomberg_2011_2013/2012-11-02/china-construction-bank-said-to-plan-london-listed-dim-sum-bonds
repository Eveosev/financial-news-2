China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the
nation’s second-largest lender, is considering an offshore sale
of yuan-denominated bonds that will be listed in  London ,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  The notes would be the first so-called Dim Sum notes sold
by a Chinese company to be listed in the city, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The notes are expected to be issued this
month, said the person, who asked not to be named because the
terms aren’t set.  China Construction Bank plans to sell as much as 2.5
billion yuan ($401 million) of the securities to help develop
its offshore yuan business, Fitch Ratings said in a report
today. CCBL Funding Plc, a special purpose vehicle of the bank’s
London unit, will sell the debt guaranteed by the parent, Fitch
wrote.  Of the 512 billion  yuan  of Dim Sum notes sold to date,
eight are listed in London, including debt issued by Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., HSBC Holdings Plc and Lloyds
Banking Group Plc, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said in
April he plans to make London a center for financial products
denominated in the Chinese currency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
