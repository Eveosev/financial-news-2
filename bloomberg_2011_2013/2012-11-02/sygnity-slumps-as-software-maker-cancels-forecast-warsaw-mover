Sygnity SA (SGN) , a Polish software maker,
fell to the lowest level in 17 years in Warsaw after withdrawing
its 2012 forecasts.  The  stock  fell 7.2 percent to 11.14 zloty, the lowest since
October 1995. That values the company at 132 million zloty ($41
million). It has lost 38 percent  this year , compared with a 9.4
percent advance for the WIG20 Index. The Polish market was
closed yesterday.  The software producer withdrew this year’s forecasts,
citing “deterioration“ of revenue and earnings before interest
and taxes, it said in a regulatory filing on Oct. 31. Sygnity
had seen sales at 580 million zloty to 620 million zloty and
Ebit at 5 percent to 7 percent of sales.  “The company continues to lose credibility,” Konrad Ksiezopolski, an analyst at Espirito Santo Investment in Warsaw,
said by phone. “Now the market is waiting for Sygnity’s new
strategy and it will take them some time to regain investors’
confidence.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
