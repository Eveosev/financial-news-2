German government bonds declined
after a report showed U.S. hiring increased more than forecast
last month.  The  10-year bund yield  rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.48 percent at 12:32 p.m. London time.  A net 171,000 workers were added to payrolls after a
148,000 gain in September, Labor Department figures showed today
in  Washington . The median forecast of 91 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for an advance of 125,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
