Colombia’s peso fell the most in a
week after financial regulators said they’ll take over
 Interbolsa SA (INTBOL) ’s brokerage unit.  The  peso  weakened 0.3 percent to 1,830.8 per U.S. dollar at
9:56 a.m. in Bogota. The currency has gained 5.9 percent this
year.  “The regulator’s statement added noise and uncertainty to
the market,” said Diana Guiza, an analyst at Corredores
Asociados brokerage in Bogota. “People are looking to hedge, so
there is greater demand for dollars.”  Colombia’s financial regulators will take over the Bogota-
based brokerage after parent company Interbolsa tumbled the most
on record yesterday, on a statement that its unit is facing a
“temporary” funding shortage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
