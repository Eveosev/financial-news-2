United Nations Certified Emission
Reduction credits for December dropped to a four-day low as
supplies will probably rise this month to a record.  CERs declined as much as 10 percent to 86 euro cents
($1.11) a metric ton and were at 93 cents at 10 a.m. in  London 
on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London.  The credits fell to an all-time low of 71 euro cents a ton
on Oct. 25, as demand in Europe remained muted by low levels of
economic production. Supplies of new CERs may rise to a record
57 million tons this month, according to data from the website
of the UN Framework Convention on  Climate Change  in Bonn.  European Union permits for December declined 0.6 percent
today to 8 euros a ton. Emission Reduction Units for the same
month lost 10 percent to 61 euro cents a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
