Huntsman Corp. (HUN) , the biggest maker of
textile dyes, climbed the most in more than two months as demand
for chemicals used in insulation and composite wood helped boost
third-quarter earnings past analysts’ expectations.  Huntsman rose 4.2 percent to $16.19 at the close in  New
York , the biggest gain since Aug. 15. The company is based in
 Salt Lake City  and run from The Woodlands,  Texas .  Net income was $116 million, or 48 cents a share, compared
with a net loss of 34 million, or 14 cents, a year earlier,
Huntsman said today in a statement. Profit excluding
restructuring and other expenses was 70 cents a share, exceeding
the 51-cent average of 11 analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Adjusted profit in the polyurethanes unit, which makes
ingredients for insulation, adhesives and composite wood, rose
71 percent to $239 million on higher prices and stronger demand
in Europe and Asia. That more than made up for a 55 percent
decline in pigments, where sales volumes for titanium dioxide,
known as TiO2, fell and ore costs rose.  “Investors should take comfort that polyurethanes
continues to offset the expected decline in TiO2,”  Edlain Rodriguez , an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets LLC in New York,
who recommends buying the shares, said today in a note.  Revenue declined 7.9 percent to $2.74 billion from $2.98
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
