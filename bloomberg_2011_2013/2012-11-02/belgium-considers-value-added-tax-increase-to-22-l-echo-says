The Belgian government is considering
the possibility of raising the value-added tax to 22 percent to
help plug a hole in the 2013 budget,  L’Echo  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  A VAT increase from the current 21 percent could raise 1
billion euros ($1.3 billion), according to the newspaper, which
said a total of 3.7 billion euros needs to be found to keep the
spending plan on track. Ministers discussed the 2013 budget on
Oct. 31 and will resume talks tomorrow, according to L’Echo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
