Morgan Stanley (MS)  raised a $624.5
million collateralized loan obligation for Sankaty Advisors LLC,
the largest U.S. CLO for the firm, according to two people with
knowledge of the deal.  The fund includes a $381 million slice rated AAA that pays
142 basis points more than the London interbank offered rate,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the terms
are private. Libor is a rate at which banks say they can borrow
in dollars from each other.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  Bank of America Corp. raised a $414 million CLO for the
firm in April, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mary Claire Delaney, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, declined
to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
