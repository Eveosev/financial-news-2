Aqua America Inc. (WTR) , the second-largest
publicly traded U.S. water utility by market value, reported
third-quarter revenue of $214.6 million, 12 percent higher than
a year earlier.  The revenue gain was more than analysts’ estimates of
$213.3 million, with adjusted earnings per share of 36 cents
compared with 35 cents per share analyst estimates. Net income
rose 23 percent on the back of the revenue gain, the Bryn Mawr,
Pennsylvania-based company said in a statement.  “These results reflect management’s focus on investing the
capital needed for infrastructure improvements and receiving
timely rate relief while simultaneously working to control
operating costs,” Aqua America Chief Executive Officer Nicholas DeBenedictis said in yesterday’s statement.  In the first nine months of 2012, the water utility
invested $262.8 million in regulated infrastructure improvements
as part of its investment program compared with $222.4 million
in the same period of 2011. The company said it remains on
course to invest more than $300 million in 2012, including pipe
replacement projects and water plant upgrades.  Aqua America announced Sept. 25 that it offered to sell its
 Florida  water and wastewater systems to the Florida Governmental
Utility Authority for $95 million, which would
conclude Aqua America’s operations in Florida. The FGUA has
until Nov. 30 to accept or decline the offer.  The shares have risen almost 17 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
