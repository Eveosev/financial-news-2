Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-biggest
U.S. energy company by market value, said third-quarter profit
declined as output plunged to a 4-year low,  oil prices  slumped
and refining income dropped 65 percent.  Net income was $5.25 billion, or $2.69 a share, compared
with $7.83 billion, or $3.92, a year earlier,  San Ramon ,
California-based Chevron said in a statement today. Per-share
results were 15 cents less than the $2.84 average of 19
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Oil and natural gas  production  from Chevron’s wells dropped
to the lowest since the third quarter of 2008 after Hurricane
Isaac shut output in the  Gulf of Mexico  and oilfield repairs
were conducted in Kazakhstan and the U.K. Isaac also forced the
shutdown of Chevron’s largest refinery in Pascagoula,
 Mississippi , and a fire damaged the company’s San Francisco-area
plant.  Chevron’s fuel-production profit fell by $1.3 billion to
$689 million because of the plant outages and declining fuel
margins. The U.S. margin for processing oil into gasoline and
diesel fell 5.2 percent to an average of $30.86 per barrel
during the quarter, based on benchmark futures contracts traded
in New York.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Watson is
spending almost $90 million a day this year to expand the search
for untapped reserves from the  Indian Ocean  to the Baltic Sea.
The company is aiming to raise production by one-fifth by the
end of 2017 to the equivalent of 3.3 million barrels of crude.  Energy Prices  The earnings statement was released before the opening of
regular U.S. stock trading. Chevron rose 1.1 percent yesterday
to $111.46 at the close in  New York . Sales fell 9.9 percent to
$58.04 billion.  Profit from oil and gas wells declined by 17 percent to
$5.14 billion as output fell to the equivalent of 2.52 million
barrels of crude a day from 2.6 million a year earlier,
according to the statement.  Brent crude futures, the benchmark for two-thirds of the
world’s oil, fell 2.4 percent during the quarter to an average
of $109.42 a barrel. Worldwide crude output rose by 2.16 million
barrels a day during the third quarter from a year earlier, four
times faster than the 540,000-barrel-a-day increase in demand,
according to an Oct. 12 report by the  International Energy
Agency .  Chevron’s performance also was diminished by a 29 percent
decline in U.S. gas prices from a year earlier to an average of
$2.893 per million British thermal units during the quarter.
Horizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing have allowed explorers
to penetrate gas-rich shale formations in the U.S. Great Plains,
Appalachia and western Canada, leading to a North American
supply glut.  Chevron has risen 4.7 percent this year, outperforming the
1.8 percent increase in Brent crude futures. The shares have 20
buy recommendations from analysts, eight holds and one sell
rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
