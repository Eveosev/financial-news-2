As much as 500 million gallons of raw
sewage a day is flowing into Newark Bay after superstorm Sandy
disabled the nation’s fifth-largest wastewater treatment plant.  Larry Hajna, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection, said it wasn’t clear when the
facility, operated by the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission,
can resume operations.  “We’re advising people to avoid direct contact with the
water, and avoid fishing or crabbing or other recreational
activities,” Hajna said.  Between 300 million and 500 million gallons of untreated
sewage is flowing each day into the bay, which feeds Arthur
Kill, a tidal estuary, and Raritan Bay en route to the Atlantic
Ocean.  The effluent “breaks apart and degrades as it moves
through the estuary,” Hajna said.  Sandy knocked out power to the treatment facility early
Oct. 29 as the storm, the biggest recorded in the Atlantic
Ocean, slammed into the mid-Atlantic region. While power has
been restored, plant operators must clear flooded areas and
clean equipment before treatment can resume, he said.  Several states in Sandy’s path had untreated waste reaching
waterways as facilities were knocked out in the storm.  In New York, 10 plants reported untreated waste reaching
bodies of water. As of yesterday, four treatment facilities were
still not operating normally, according to a release from
Governor Andrew Cuomo’s office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
