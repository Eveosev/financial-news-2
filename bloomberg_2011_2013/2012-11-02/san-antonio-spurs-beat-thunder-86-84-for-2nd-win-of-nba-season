Tony Parker  scored with a 21-foot
jump shot as time expired to give the San Antonio Spurs an 86-84
win over the Oklahoma City Thunder.  The victory at AT&T Center in San Antonio last night keeps
the Spurs unbeaten through two games in the National Basketball
Association regular season.  In June, the Thunder beat the Spurs in six games to reach
the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Miami Heat in five games.
The Heat are favored to retain the title, with a successful $100
bet returning $225, according to Pregame.com. The Los Angeles
Lakers, who have started the season 0-2, are second in the
betting, followed by the Thunder.  Tim Duncan led the Spurs with 20 points, while Parker had
14 points and 11 assists.  Kevin Durant  had 23 points and 14 rebounds, and  Russell Westbrook  added 18 points for the Thunder in their season opener.  To contact the reporter on this story:
