Japanese  stocks  rose for a third day
as the yen weakened and reports on U.S. employment,
manufacturing and  consumer confidence  signaled improvement in
the world’s largest economy.  Bridgestone Corp. (5108) , a tiremaker that counts the Americas as
its biggest market, rose 2.3 percent.  Sumitomo Heavy (6302)  Industries
Ltd. jumped 6.6 percent after its operating profit fell less
than forecast.  Sharp Corp. (6753)  slid 2.4 percent after the TV maker
projected a record loss and said there was “material doubt”
about its survival.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 1.2 percent to 9,051.22
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, with a weekly gain of 1.3 percent.
Volume on the gauge was more than 10 percent more than the 30-
day average for the time of day. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index climbed
1.2 percent to 752.09, with more than three shares advancing for
each that fell.  “The  U.S. economy  was kind of stagnant but recently seems
to be showing improvement, which is giving investors more faith
in the global outlook,” Koji Toda, chief  fund manager  at Resona
Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, which oversees about $75 billion. “There’s
a feeling that with restructuring, a weaker yen and a pick up in
the U.S. economy, Japanese companies will recover.”  The Topix has risen 4.6 percent since Sept. 6 after the
 European Central Bank  started a global wave of stimulus to boost
growth, with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan
following suit. Shares on the equity gauge traded at 0.9 times
book value, compared with 2.2 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 1.5 for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index.  U.S. Jobs  Futures on the  S&P 500  were little changed today. The gauge
yesterday gained 1.1 percent, its biggest advance in seven
weeks, on a report U.S. companies expanded payrolls in October
by the most in eight months. Adding to signs of recovery, the
Institute for Supply Management’s U.S. factory index topped
estimates, and a measure of consumer sentiment rose to the
highest since February 2008.  The dollar strengthened, sending the yen to 80.3 against
the greenback today in Tokyo, compared with 80.02 at the close
of stock trading yesterday. A weaker Japanese currency boosts
overseas income at companies when repatriated.  Bridgestone rose 2.3 percent to 1,892 yen. Fuji Heavy
Industries Ltd., which makes Subaru brand vehicles and counts
 North America  as its biggest market, climbed 3.8 percent to 799
yen.  ‘Hit Bottom’  “The U.S. economy is solid and the slowing economy has hit
the bottom,” said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Tokyo-
based Nomura Holdings Inc.  Today’s monthly employment report from the Labor Department
will provide more information about the strength of the economy
before the presidential election next week. Payrolls probably
increased by 125,000 workers in October and the jobless rate
rose to 7.9 percent, according to the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Japan’s earnings season peaked this week, with more than
570 of the 1,676 Topix companies reporting results. Of the 350
companies on the Topix which have reported quarterly revenue
since Oct. 1 and for which  Bloomberg News  has estimates, 65
percent have missed projections.  Sharp lost 2.4 percent to 165 yen after the TV maker said
there was “material doubt” about its ability to survive after
forecasting a record $5.6 billion full-year loss on falling
demand for its display panels. Sharp follows Panasonic Corp. in
predicting losses that exceeded analysts estimates after losing
ground to Samsung Electronics Co.  Nikon Corp. (7731)  declined the most in the Nikkei 225, falling
6.1 percent to 1,928 yen. The camera maker cut its full-year
operating profit forecast 15 percent to 72 billion yen, citing
slumping capital investments in chip-related industry.  Sumitomo Heavy soared 6.6 percent to 306 yen after the
machinery maker said operating profit amounted to 17.4 billion
yen in the six months ended Sept. 30, beating its forecast by 29
percent on cost cuts.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  sank 3.7 percent
to 18.42, indicating that traders expect a swing of 5.3 percent
on the equity benchmark in the next 30 days.  -- With assistance from Masaaki Iwamoto in Tokyo. Editors:  Jim
