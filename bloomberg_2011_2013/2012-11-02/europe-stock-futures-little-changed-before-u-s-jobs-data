European stocks advanced to a two-
week high as a report showed that hiring in the U.S. last month
increased more than forecast.  Beiersdorf AG (BEI)  surged to the highest price in more than 16
years after raising its 2012 sales-growth forecast.  Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  and  Daimler AG (DAI)  led carmakers higher, gaining at
least 1.5 percent each. Alcatel-Lucent SA tumbled 5.5 percent
after it swung to a third-quarter loss.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index added 0.4 percent to 274.85 at
the close of trading. The gauge completed a weekly rally of 1.6
percent as data from  China  and the U.S. beat estimates and as
companies reported better-than-forecast earnings. The measure
has surged 18 percent from this year’s low on June 4.  “The U.S. unemployment figures were better than expected
and a positive for the markets,” said Gerard Lane, a strategist
at Shore Capital Group Ltd. in Liverpool,  England . “If this
pace of economic growth can continue and we don’t see a fiscal
cliff, markets may carry on going up.”  The fiscal cliff refers to $607 billion in tax increases
and spending cuts that will take effect at the start of the next
year unless Congress breaks a deadlock in budget discussions.  Hiring in the U.S. increased by 171,000 in October,
following a revised 148,000 a month earlier, Labor Department
figures showed today. That compares with the 125,000 projected
by economists in a Bloomberg survey. Private payrolls, which
exclude government jobs, rose by 184,000 last month after a
revised 128,000 in September. The  unemployment  rate climbed to

 European (SXXP)  markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 added 0.1 percent.
 France ’s CAC 40 rose 0.5 percent and  Germany ’s DAX added 0.4
percent.  Beiersdorf jumped 7.2 percent to 60.70 euros, the highest
price since at least January 1996, after the maker of Nivea
skin-care products raised its 2012 forecast for sales growth to
as much as 4 percent, from a previous prediction of 3 percent.  A gauge of carmakers rose 1.2 percent for the  second-best
performance  among the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600. BMW
advanced 2.7 percent to 65 euros after saying U.S. sales climbed
21 percent in October. Daimler added 1.6 percent to 37.09 euros.  Telekom Austria AG (TKA)  gained 2.6 percent to 4.99 euros after

posting a third-quarter net loss of 146 million euros, compared
with a profit of 194 million euros a year earlier. The phone-
equipment maker, whose shares have dropped 36 percent so far
this year, is France’s most-shorted stock, based on data
compiled by financial-information provider Markit, signaling a
growing number of investors are predicting further declines.  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  dropped 2.6 percent to 8.66 euros. The
company may cut its dividend from next year by as much as a
third, Handelsblatt reported, citing unidentified supervisory
board members.  Admiral Group Plc (ADM)  lost 5.3 percent to 1,081 pence after
saying third-quarter revenue fell 2 percent to 570 million
pounds ($918 million) from a year earlier.  Hikma Pharmaceuticals Plc (HIK)  slid 2.1 percent to 738.5 pence
after saying it expects a full-year loss of about $15 million
from its generics division, compared with a previous forecast
that it would break even. “We are reviewing this business and
are considering all strategic options,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
