products in the first half of the Iranian year that began in
March by 40 percent even amid international sanctions, Deputy
Minister of Industry, Mine and Trade Safdar Rahmatabadi said.  Iranian products are now sold in 170 countries, state-run
Fars news agency quoted Rahmatabadi  as saying . He didn’t give
details on the exports or how much they are worth.  The U.S. and the European Union imposed sanctions on Iran
