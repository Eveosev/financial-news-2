The pound extended a decline against
the dollar after a report showed U.S. employers added more jobs
in October than economists forecast.  Sterling dropped 0.5 percent to $1.6052 at 12:39 p.m.
London time. The U.K. currency rose 0.2 percent to 80.07 pence
per euro.  U.K. 10-year government bonds declined, with the yield
rising three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.90
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
