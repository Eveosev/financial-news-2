Copper fell for the first time in
four days, heading for a fourth weekly drop, on concern that a
pickup in  China’s economy  may fail to pare inventories.  Metal for delivery in three months declined as much as 0.7
percent to $7,770.75 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
and traded at $7,779.50 at 2:17 p.m.  Shanghai  time. The metal is
poised for a 0.5 percent loss this week.  Consumption in  China , the world’s largest user, will rise
4.8 percent this year, lower than an August forecast of 5
percent, Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. said on
Oct. 30. That would make it the slowest pace since 1997.
Smelters face oversupply with stockpiles in bonded warehouses in
Shanghai estimated at 600,000 tons to 700,000 tons, according to
Richard Wilson, chairman of metals at Wood Mackenzie.  “There should be a bit of profit-taking after the gains in
the last couple of days because there’s simply no sign that
demand will rise strongly enough to absorb the huge
inventories,” said Fang Junfeng, an analyst at Shanghai CIFCO
Futures Co. “We are not bullish on copper.”  Copper for delivery in December fell 0.6 percent to $3.5305
a pound on the Comex in  New York . February futures dropped 0.8
percent to 56,680  yuan  ($9,080) a ton on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange.  Aluminum, zinc, tin and lead also declined in London, while
nickel climbed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
