EBay Inc. (EBAY) , owner of the world’s
largest Internet marketplace, is looking to expand in  China  by
teaming up with luxury retailer  Xiu.com , according to a person
with direct knowledge of the pact.  EBay will announce the partnership at an event on Nov. 12
in Shenzhen, China, where Xiu.com is based, said the person, who
asked not to be named because the plans haven’t been publicly
disclosed.  The pairing marks the first major drive by EBay Chief
Executive Officer John Donahoe into the most populous country
since he took over in 2008. He’ll face competition from sites
such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Taobao.com, China’s largest
online retailer. EBay retrenched in China in 2007, and
highlighted the challenges of profiting in the nation in a
January regulatory  filing .  “In 2002 we withdrew our EBay marketplace offering from
the Japanese market, and in 2007 we contributed our business in
China to a joint venture with a local Chinese company,” the
company said in the filing. “Even if we are successful in
developing new markets, we often expect the costs of operating
new sites to exceed our net revenues from those sites for at
least 12 months in most countries.”  EBay, based in San Jose,  California , rose 2 percent to
$49.22 at the close yesterday in New York. The shares had
increased 62 percent this year before today. EBay doesn’t plan
to make an investment in the Chinese company, according to the
Financial Times, which previously reported the Xiu.com
partnership.  To contact the reporter on this story:
