OAO Gazprom, the world’s biggest
natural gas producer, said second-quarter profit fell 50
percent, beating estimates, as the state-run company gave price
discounts to European clients and the ruble weakened.  Net income declined to 150.8 billion rubles ($4.8 billion)
from 303.7 billion rubles a year earlier, the Moscow-based
company said in financial statements on its website today. That
was higher than an average estimate of 140.3 billion rubles from
nine analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg. Revenue slid 2.4 percent to
1.01 trillion rubles.  Gazprom shares rose 1.2 percent, the biggest gain in 11
days, to 146.14 rubles at the close in Moscow. The stock has
lost 15 percent so far this year.  “We remain cautious on the name, due to the company’s weak
marketing policy in the EU, which is likely to jeopardize the
company’s market share going forward, and continued value
destruction from questionable investments,” UralSib Capital
said today in a note.  Gazprom,  Russia ’s gas export monopoly, recognized 54.7
billion rubles in retroactive discounts to European customers in
the second quarter, following 78.5 billion rubles in the
previous three months, according to the statements.  Gas sales volumes fell by 11 percent in the first six
months of the year, to 256 billion cubic meters, with declines
across all three markets,  Europe , former Soviet Union and
Russia. Net revenue from gas sales dropped even as prices
increased domestically and in other former Soviet republics.  Falling Exports  In January through October, exports to Europe dropped to
113.1 billion cubic meters from 123 billion cubic meters a year
earlier, the company said yesterday.  A net foreign exchange loss of 143 billion rubles in the
second quarter, compared with a gain of 7.3 billion rubles a
year earlier, also hurt profit as the ruble depreciated.  “We doubt that the company will be able to achieve its
2012 Ebitda forecast of $58 billion,” IFC Metropol said in a
research note yesterday, referring to earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization. “We anticipate no
significant free  cash flow  in 2012.”  Gazprom had negative free cash flow of almost 147 billion
rubles in the second quarter, compared with a positive 215
billion rubles in the previous three months, according to
calculations based on the company’s first-half numbers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
