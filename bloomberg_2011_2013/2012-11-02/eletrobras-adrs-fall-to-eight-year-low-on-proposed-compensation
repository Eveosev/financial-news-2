Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (EBR) ,
South America’s largest power producer, plunged to an eight-year
low in New York after  Brazil ’s government proposed less
compensation for rate cuts than the company expected.  American depositary receipts of Eletrobras, as Centrais
Eletricas is known, tumbled 9 percent to $5.16 at the close of
trading, the lowest since July 2004. Trading surged to 186
percent of the average volume in the past three months,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazilian markets were
closed for a holiday.  Brazil’s government proposed compensating utilities a total
of about 19 billion reais ($9.4 billion) for next year’s early
renewal of generation and transmission contracts that had been
set to expire between 2015 and 2017, according to the official
gazette. New concession rules will lower revenue and the power
rates charged as part of a package announced by President Dilma Rousseff in September that aims to cut electricity costs by as
much as 28 percent.  Eletrobras will receive 14 billion reais if it agrees to
renew its concession under the new rules. Jose da Costa Carvalho Neto, president of the state-controlled utility, said this week
that he expected the company to receive “close to” 30 billion
reais in compensation.  ADRs of  Cia Energetica de Minas Gerais (CMIG4) , or  Cemig (CIG) , fell 2.7
percent to $11.87. The company may receive 285.4 million reais,
and is among the utilities with the most assets renewing
concessions under the new terms.  Cia Paranaense de Energia (CPLE3) , known as  Copel (ELP) , would receive
893.9 million reais under the government’s proposal. Its ADRs
fell 0.8 percent to $14.83.  To contact the reporter on this story:
