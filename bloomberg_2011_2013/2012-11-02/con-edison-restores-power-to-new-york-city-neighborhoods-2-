Consolidated Edison Inc. (ED)  has restored
power to 94,000 customers in  New York City  and expects the rest
of Manhattan to have electricity by tomorrow night.  The area of restoration includes the East Village, Chelsea
and the Flatiron, Alfonso Quiroz, a spokesman for the
New York-based utility, said in a phone interview today. Power
has been restored from Broadway to the East River between Canal
and 14th streets and, on the west side, from 5th Avenue to the
Hudson between 14th and 31st streets.  Power was returned to 67,000 customers in New York City’s
East Village, and to 27,000 in the Chelsea, West Chelsea and
FlatIron neighborhoods, Quiroz said.  Con Edison will bring two more underground power networks
online today that supply homes and businesses south of the
Brooklyn Bridge, Mike Clendenin, a spokesman for the New York-
based utility, said earlier in a phone interview.  Earlier today, electricity was out for about 220,000
customers in Manhattan. About 3.5 million customers are without
power in the region after  Hurricane Sandy  made landfall in  New
Jersey  on Oct. 29, according to the Energy Department. Some
utilities are saying full restoration may take as long as two
weeks.  Blackouts in Manhattan may linger for about 130 buildings
mostly along the East River that suffered major flooding because
of damage to customer equipment, John Miksad, Con Edison’s
senior vice president for electric operations, said on a
conference call yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
