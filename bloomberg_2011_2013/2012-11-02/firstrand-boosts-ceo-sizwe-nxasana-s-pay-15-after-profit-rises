  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) , South Africa’s
second-biggest financial-services company, increased Chief
Executive Officer Sizwe Nxasana’s compensation by 15 percent
after the lender boosted profit by a third.  Nxasana was paid a total of 22.5 million rand ($2.6
million) for the year ended June, including a salary of 7.5
million rand and performance-related compensation of 15 million
rand, according to the Johannesburg-based firm’s  annual report 
published on its website today. The CEO received 19.6 million
rand last year, comprised of 6.9 million rand in salary and a
12.7 million-rand bonus.  “Of the 15 million rand million variable pay, 11.5 million
rand is deferred, in a mix of cash and shares, and at risk,”
Sam Moss, a spokeswoman for FirstRand, said in an e-mailed
response to questions today. Last year 9.5 million rand of the
bonus was deferred, she said.  FirstRand said on Sept. 11 that full-year profit rose 34
percent as  consumer lending  was boosted by unsecured credit and
low  interest rates . Patrice Rassou, a FirstRand investor who
helps oversee about $63.5 billion as head of equities at Sanlam
Investment Management in  Cape Town , called the company’s results
the best of South Africa’s four largest banks.  Standard Bank Group Ltd. boosted profit by 9 percent in the
six months to June, while Barclays Plc’s  Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) 
reported a decline in earnings.  Nxasana, 54, who has been CEO of the group since January
2010, was also awarded more than 800,000 shares from a variety
of company stock plans, according to the annual report. Of this
amount, he received 576,567 shares in 2012 and the balance
reflects shares received as part of deferred components from
previous years, Moss said.  FirstRand is the best-performing stock on the six-member
 FTSE/JSE Africa Banks Index (JBNKS)  this year, having gained 42 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
