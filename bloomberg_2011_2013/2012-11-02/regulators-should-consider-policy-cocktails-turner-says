Global regulators and central bankers
may need to consider “innovative and unconventional
combinations” of policies to prevent deflation,  Financial
Services Authority  Chairman Adair Turner said in a speech in
South Africa.  Turner said “the deflationary impact on economic growth
could extend for many years ahead” if the policy response to
the 2008 financial crisis wasn’t carefully designed.  The Bank of England’s policy of quantitative easing “may
be subject to declining marginal impact,” Turner said, causing
“a liquidity trap in which replacing private sector holdings of
bonds with private sector holdings of money has little impact on
behavior and thus on demand.”  Turner has overseen a loosening in FSA requirements for
banks’ to hold capital and liquidity buffers since June. The FSA
relaxed the amount of funds U.K. banks must hold against
domestic lending last month. The regulator has also said it
would include BOE liquidity measures in calculating banks’
liquid asset buffers, giving lenders room to dip into reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
