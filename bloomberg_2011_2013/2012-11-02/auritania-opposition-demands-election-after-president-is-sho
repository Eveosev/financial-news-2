Mauritania’s opposition leader
demanded elections to end a “constitutional vacuum” created by
the absence of President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, who’s being
treated in  France  after being shot by soldiers in what the
government says was an accident.  Saleh Ould Hanenna, president of the Coordination of
Democratic Opposition in Mauritania, called for a transitional
period to be announced and for a “convincing explanation” of
the circumstances of the president’s shooting, and his current
medical condition. He was speaking at a rally in the capital,
Nouakchott, late yesterday.  Abdel Aziz was shot “by mistake” on Oct. 13 by a military
unit accompanying him, according to Hamdi Ould Mahjoub, the
communications minister and government spokesman. Messoud Ould Boulkheir, president of the National Assembly, told journalists
on Oct. 31 that he had spoken to Abdel Aziz that day and
president’s health was improving.  The Associated Press yesterday quoted members of Abdel
Aziz’s family as saying that he is recovering well and should
return home soon. His son, Ahmedou Aziz, said the president had
been traveling in an unmarked car with no official escort, and
guards at a checkpoint had failed to recognize it and opened
fire when the vehicle failed to slow down, AP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
