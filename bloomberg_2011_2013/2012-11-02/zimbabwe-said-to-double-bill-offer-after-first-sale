The  Reserve Bank  of Zimbabwe will
offer to sell $30 million of 91-day Treasury bills on Nov. 6
after completing its first successful sale of securities since
2008 last week, an official at the central bank said.  The offer is double the size of the $15 million auctioned
on Oct. 26. That offer resulted in the sale of $9.9 million of
91-day bills at an average yield of 8.51 percent. The official
declined to be identified because he isnâ€™t authorized to speak
to the press. The central bank said it may reply later by e-mail
to questions from Bloomberg.  The bank received $11.1 million in bids with yields ranging
from 5 percent to 13 percent at the Oct. 26 auction, having
rejected all bids at attempted sales on Oct. 4 and Oct. 24.  The country abandoned the Zimbabwe dollar in February 2009
and adopted the U.S. currency after inflation accelerated to 500
billion percent, according to an International Monetary Fund
estimate. A decade-long recession ended that year after the 15-
nation  Southern African Development Community  brokered a
resolution to a political standoff between the party of
President  Robert Mugabe  and the Movement for Democratic Change
of  Morgan Tsvangirai .  The plan to restart the bill sales was announced in July by
Gideon Gono, the central bank governor. Zimbabwe lacks a
benchmark  interest rate . The weighted average lending rate for
private banks ranged between 14 percent and 20 percent in the
four months through July 31, Gono said in a  midyear monetary
policy statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
