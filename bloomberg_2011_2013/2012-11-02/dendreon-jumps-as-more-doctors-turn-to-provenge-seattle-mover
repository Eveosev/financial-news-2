Dendreon Corp. (DNDN)  rose the most in nine
months after announcing a third-quarter loss that was less than
analysts’ estimates and saying more doctors are using its
prostate cancer drug Provenge.  The biotechnology company jumped 16 percent to $4.47 at the
close in  New York , its biggest single-day advance since Feb. 6.
The Seattle-based drugmaker had a loss of 33 cents a share,
excluding a restructuring charge. Analysts had expected a loss
of 82 cents, according to the average of 22 estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  Urologists prescribing Provenge grew 14 percent in the
quarter, Dendreon said today in a statement. The number of
oncologists doing so fell by less than 1 percent, an improvement
from an 8 percent slide in the second quarter. The medicine
accounted for two-thirds of Dendreon’s sales last year and faces
competition from new drugs from  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  and  Medivation
Inc. (MDVN)   “We delivered strong growth in urology and have continued
to improve results in oncology,” Chief Executive Officer John
H. Johnson said in a statement today.  The quarter’s net loss of $154.9 million, or $1.04 a share,
compared with a net loss of $147.1 million, or $1, a year
earlier, Dendreon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
