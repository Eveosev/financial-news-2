The 100 wealthiest people on the
planet dropped $4.2 billion from their collective net worth this
week after  Hurricane Sandy  halted trading in the U.S. for two
days.  Mexican  Carlos Slim , 72, lost $2.9 billion after the
Colombian government announced Thursday that his Mexico City-
based telecommunications company, America Movil SAB, will be
partially excluded in an auction of licenses for 4G airwaves
next year. Slim remains the world’s richest person with a $74.7
billion fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  “The main impact was the shutdown of the exchange for two
days,” said Walter “Bucky” Hellwig, who helps manage $17
billion at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. “The
first day the exchange was open the phones were still down up
there.”  NYSE Euronext shut markets across every asset class on
Monday and Tuesday, the first consecutive closures because of
weather since 1888, as Sandy barreled into the East Coast.
Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and all other U.S. equity markets also
shut down. The U.S. Labor Department yesterday presented its
last jobs before next week’s presidential election. A net
171,000 workers were added to payrolls in October, according to
the report.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.16 percent during
the week to close at 1414.20 in New York. The Stoxx Europe 600
Index rose 1.6 percent, closing at 274.85.  Buffett, Mikhelson  Microsoft Corp. co-founder  Bill Gates , 57, is the worlds’s
second-richest person with $63.3 billion. Europe’s richest man,
 Amancio Ortega , the 76-year-old founder of  Inditex SA (ITX) , the
world’s biggest clothing retailer and owner of the Zara clothing
chain, is No. 3 on the index with a net worth of $54.1 billion,
$7.5 billion ahead of  Warren Buffett , 82.  Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-based,  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) 
agreed yesterday to buy closely held Oriental Trading Co., the
U.S. direct retailer of party and craft supplies based in the
same city as Berkshire, for about $500 million.  Leonid Mikhelson, the billionaire who controls Tarko-Sale,
Siberia-based OAO Novatek, Russia’s largest private gas
producer, lost a 25-year contract to supply natural gas to
state-run OAO Inter RAO UES’s power plants to OAO Rosneft,
Russia’s biggest oil producer. The 57-year-old lost $1.3 billion
as Novatek shares were down almost 10 percent for the week in
London trading. He ranks 45th on the list with a net worth of
$15.8 billion.  The  Bloomberg Billionaires Index  takes measure of the
world’s wealthiest people based on market and economic changes
