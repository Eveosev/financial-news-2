Canada’s dollar strengthened versus
its U.S. counterpart after payrolls increased more than forecast
in America, the nation’s biggest trade partner.  The currency rose versus most major peers even after
Canadian job growth slowed more than forecast last month. The
U.S. data boosted speculation America’s economic recovery is
gaining momentum.  “People will expect some sort of knock-on effect from job
growth in the U.S., which, while it was moderate, is certainly
on the plus side of the ledger,” said  Dean Popplewell , head
analyst in Toronto at the online currency-trading firm Oanda
Corp. “Canada certainly disappointed.”  The Canadian currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, gained 0.3 percent 99.40
cents per U.S. dollar at 8:57 a.m. in Toronto after weakening as
much as 0.2 percent earlier. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0060.  Canadian  government bonds  fell, pushing the yield on the
benchmark  10-year security  up two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.81 percent.  The last U.S. jobs report before next week’s presidential
election showed a net 171,000 workers were added to payrolls in
October after a 148,000 gain in September that was more than
first estimated. The Labor Department figures issued the data
today in Washington. The median forecast of 91 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for an increase of 125,000. The
U.S. jobless rate rose to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent as more
people entered the  labor force .  Canadian employment  rose by 1,800 following September’s
52,100 gain,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. Gains in
public-sector work were curbed by a decline in agriculture.
Economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  projected job creation of
10,000, according to median of 23 forecasts.  The nation’s  unemployment rate  remained at 7.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
