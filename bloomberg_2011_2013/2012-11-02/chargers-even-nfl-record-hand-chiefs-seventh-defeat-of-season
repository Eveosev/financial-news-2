Philip Rivers  passed for two
touchdowns as the  San Diego Chargers  defeated the Kansas City
Chiefs 31-13 in the  National Football League .  The Chargers ended a three-game losing run last night to
improve to 4-4, while the Chiefs dropped to 1-7, the worst
record in the NFL, with their fifth straight defeat.  Rivers, who completed 18 of 20 passing attempts for 220
yards, found Antonio Gates with a 14-yard scoring pass in the
first quarter at Qualcomm Stadium in  San Diego .  In a three-minute span in the final quarter, Rivers threw a
13-yard touchdown pass to Malcom Floyd, Shaun Phillips recovered
a fumble by Chiefs quarterback Matt Cassel when he was sacked on
the Kansas City goal line and Demorrio Williams scored on a 59-
yard interception.  Ryan Succop kicked field goals of 49 and 41 yards in the
second and third quarters for the Chiefs, and Shaun Draughn
scored on a 6-yard run with four minutes, 30 seconds left in the
game.  Cassel went 19-of-29 for 181 yards and one interception.  To contact the reporter on this story:
