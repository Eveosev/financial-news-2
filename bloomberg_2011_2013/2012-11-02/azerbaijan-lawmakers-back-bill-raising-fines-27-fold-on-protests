Azeri lawmakers approved a law that
raises fines for organizing and attending unsanctioned rallies
almost 27 times a year before presidential elections as police
detained several dozen opposition protesters outside parliament.  The  Milli Maclis , dominated since 1995 by the ruling New
Azerbaijan Party and government allies, today voted 105 to 5 to
raise the maximum penalty for protesters who violate the law to
8,000 manat ($10,200) from 300 manat. The legislation will go
into effect after President Ilham Aliyev signs it into law.  Police detained almost 30 members of the main opposition
groups People’s Front Party of Azerbaijan and Musavat, or
Equality, as they attempted to rally outside the parliament
building today in the capital, Baku.  Azerbaijan’s secular opposition, stirred by Arab Spring
rebellions that brought down authoritarian rulers in Tunisia,
 Egypt  and  Libya , has staged protests against the government in
2011 and this year. The groups failed to galvanize enough
support to challenge Aliyev’s government as police arrested
hundreds of protesters, some of whom were later jailed for
disrupting public order and damaging private property.  To contact the reporter on this story:
