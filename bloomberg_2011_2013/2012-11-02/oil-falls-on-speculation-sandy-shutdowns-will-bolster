Oil fell to the lowest level in
almost four months on speculation that the shutdown of
refineries on the U.S. East Coast because of  Hurricane Sandy 
will add to already ample supplies.  Futures dropped for a third week as Phillips 66 and  Hess
Corp. (HES) ’s New Jersey refineries remain shut four days after the
storm struck.  Oil inventories  exceeded 370 million barrels last
week, the most for this time of year in at least 30 years.
Prices extended losses as U.S. stocks erased gains and the
dollar strengthened against the euro.  “We are still having some fallout from Sandy and prices
are influenced by what’s going on on the East Coast,” said
Jacob Correll, a Louisville, Kentucky-based analyst at Summit
Energy Inc., which manages more than $20 billion in companies’
annual energy spending. “Equities are lower and the dollar is
strengthening, and both can definitely weigh on oil.”  Crude oil for December delivery fell $2.23, or 2.6 percent,
to $84.86 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
lowest settlement since July 10. Prices fell 1.6 percent this
week. The loss for 2012 is 14 percent.  Brent oil for December slid $2.49, or 2.3 percent, to
$105.68 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange, the lowest settlement since July 31.  Assessing Damage  The resumption of operations at the  Phillips 66 (PSX)  and Hess
refineries, which have a combined capacity of 308,000 barrels a
day, are contingent on post-storm assessments, according to the
companies. Both were closed before Sandy hit and lost power
after the storm made landfall Oct. 29 in southern New Jersey.  “Hurricane-related disruptions of refineries are weighing
on the oil market,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige
Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based energy consultant. “We
could see a big inventory build in next week’s report because of
the storm’s impact.”  Sandy left a swath of devastation across much of New
Jersey, tearing apart seaside resorts, ripping houses from
foundations and cutting power to about two-thirds of homes and
businesses in the state.  “The refinery outage is bearish for oil,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment
Management in St. Louis, which oversees $1.4 billion.  Inventories declined 2.05 million barrels to 373.1 million
in the week ended Oct. 26, according to the Energy Department,
the most for the last week of October in records begun in 1982.
 Domestic production  rose to 6.67 million barrels a day, the most
since 1995.  Equities, Euro  Oil also fell as equities declined and the euro slipped to
a three-week low against the dollar after reports showed weak
manufacturing in Europe and stronger-than-expected employment
data in the U.S.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.6 percent. The euro
dropped as much as 0.9 percent to $1.2821. A stronger dollar and
weaker euro reduce oil’s appeal as an investment alternative.  In the last jobs report before next week’s election, a net
171,000 workers were added to payrolls in October after a
148,000 gain in September that was more than first estimated. An
advance of 125,000 was expected, according to a Bloomberg
survey. The jobless rate rose to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent as
more people entered the labor force, the figures showed.  Euro-area  manufacturing output  contracted in October,
adding to signs a recession in the currency bloc may extend into
next year as leaders struggle to tackle the sovereign-debt
crisis, data from London-based Markit Economics showed.  Watching Election  Oil also fell as traders waited to see whether U.S. voters
re-elect President  Barack Obama  or choose challenger  Mitt Romney 
on Nov. 6.  “You’ve got so much uncertainty surrounding Tuesday’s
election,” O’Grady said. “I just don’t think anybody feels
real confident taking any big positions.”  Oil may rise next week, a Bloomberg survey showed. Thirteen
of 30 analysts, or 43 percent, forecast crude will increase
through Nov. 9. Eleven respondents, or 37 percent, predicted a
drop. Six forecast little change.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 565,072
contracts as of 2:52 p.m. Volume totaled 421,661 contracts
yesterday, 19 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.60 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
