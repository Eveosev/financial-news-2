New York Road Runners , the group that
organizes the  New York City  Marathon, will donate $26.20 per
participant to relief efforts in the wake of  Hurricane Sandy .  With about 47,000 runners entered in the Nov. 4 race, that
should total more than $1 million even if some of those signed
up cannot make it to the starting line of the 26.2-mile (42-
kilometer) event because of transportation problems caused by
the storm.  NYRR also encouraged all runners, families, friends and the
organization’s 60,000 members to at least match the $26.20
donation to the “Race to Recover” fund.  “On Sunday, as runners cross through the five boroughs, we
want them to bring with them a sense of hope and resilience,”
Mary Wittenberg, chief executive officer of NYRR, said today at
a news conference. “The marathon is not just a race -- it’s
about helping NYC find its way down the road to recovery.”  The Rudin Family Foundations also announced a donation of
$1.1 million and race title sponsor ING Groep NV announced a
$500,000 donation. The money will be given to relief
organizations including the American Red Cross.  The storm killed at least 37 people in  New York  City and
left 4.8 million people in the region without power three days
before the race.  To contact the reporter on this story:
