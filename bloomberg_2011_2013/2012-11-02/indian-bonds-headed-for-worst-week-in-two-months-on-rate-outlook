India ’s 10-year government bonds
headed for their worst week in more than two months on
speculation faster inflation will prompt the central bank to
delay any reduction in interest rates.  The Reserve Bank of India refrained from cutting its
repurchase rate for a fourth straight review this week and
raised its  inflation  forecast. The repo  rate  has been held at 8
percent since April. The pace of price gains will be 7.5 percent
by March 2013, according to the monetary authority, compared
with an earlier projection of 7 percent and Governor Duvvuri
Subbarao’s “comfort level” of 5 percent.  “With inflation remaining above the RBI’s comfort zone, we
push back the timing of the next rate cut from December to
March,”  Tushar Poddar , an economist in Mumbai at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., wrote in a research note today.  The yield on the benchmark 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022
rose six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, this week to
8.19 percent as of 9:46 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. It was little changed today.  The benchmark wholesale-price index rose 7.81 percent in
September, the most since November 2011, official data show.
Consumer prices rose 1.9 percent in  China  the same month.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, climbed 17 basis
points this week to 7.76 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. It rose one percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
