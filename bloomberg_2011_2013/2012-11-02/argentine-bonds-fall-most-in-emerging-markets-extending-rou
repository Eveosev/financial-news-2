Argentine bonds fell the most in
 emerging markets  today, extending losses sparked by an Oct. 26
U.S. court ruling favoring bondholders of defaulted debt.  The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to own
Argentine government dollar bonds over U.S. Treasuries rose 20
basis points, or 0.2 percentage point, to 1,147 basis points at
4:15 p.m. in New York, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI
Global index. The average spread in  Latin America  narrowed 2
basis points to 361, according to the index.  S&P lowered the ratings for three Argentine provinces and
the city of  Buenos Aires  yesterday to B-, six levels below
investment grade, from B, and also cut rankings for four
Argentine banks and 11 companies. The rating for sovereign bonds
was reduced to B- two days earlier by S&P, which cited the court
ruling that said the country can’t make payments to current
bondholders while refusing to pay on defaulted bonds.  “Recent negative events underline the growing number of
risks the Argentine government could face in managing its
economic policies and finances in the short term,” the credit-
rating company said in an e-mailed statement.  The cost to insure Argentine debt against default fell 35
basis points to 1,997 basis points, after surging 298 basis
points yesterday to the highest level since July 2009. Credit-
default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a government
or company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
