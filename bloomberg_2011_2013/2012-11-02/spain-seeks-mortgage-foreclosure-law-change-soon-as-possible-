Spain ’s ruling  People’s Party  is
seeking to change foreclosure rules as the number of Spaniards
losing their homes surges along with unemployment and the
government faces mounting protest against austerity measures and
using taxpayer money to bail out banks.  “It’s not a reform we want to put off, rather one that we
want to approve as soon as possible,” Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said today during a press conference
after a weekly cabinet meeting. The government is talking to the
opposition Socialist Party to examine proposals and reach an
agreement on changes, she said, without providing details.  Around 400,000 homes have been foreclosed on in Spain since
the nation’s decade-long real estate boom ended in 2008,
according to AFES, an adviser to homeowners facing repossession.
That number is set to jump as unemployment, already the highest
in  Europe , continues to grow and tax hikes, rising energy and
food costs chip away at families’ disposable income, leading
more to miss home-loan payments.  The housing boom left Spanish banks with about 287 billion
euros in real-estate related loans in the second quarter of this
year, according to the Bank of Spain. Spanish lenders have about
600 billion euros of unpaid home loans on their books, Bank of
Spain data shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
