Vietnam  secured $200 million in
financing to help fund the government’s rural clean water and
sanitation program in eight provinces in the Red River delta,
the World Bank said.  The International Development Association credit approved
by the World Bank’s board of executive directors in  Washington ,
D.C., will aid in plans to provide safer potable water for 1.7
million people and improved sanitation for 650,000 residents in
the provinces over the 2013-2017 period, it said.  The funds will be disbursed via a new type of financing
called Program for Results that links the aid to demonstrable
results, the bank said. It will be the first in the rural water
and improved sewage sector, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
