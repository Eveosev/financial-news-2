Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. (CTB)  climbed the
most in eight months after reporting record third-quarter profit
that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  The shares gained 13 percent to $22.85 at the close in  New
York  for the biggest daily increase since Feb. 27. The Findlay,
Ohio-based company’s stock has risen 63 percent this year.  The second-largest U.S. tiremaker today posted a fourfold
jump in quarterly net income to $74.1 million, or $1.17 a share,
from $17.3 million, or 27 cents, a year earlier. The average of
six estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for per-share profit of
83 cents.  Cooper said its third-quarter results benefited as tire
sales rose and its raw-material costs fell 13 percent from the
previous three months.  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (GT) , the largest U.S. tiremaker,
on Oct. 26 reported adjusted third-quarter profit that fell
short of analysts’ estimates, sending its shares down as much as
11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
