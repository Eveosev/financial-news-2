Estonia’s  economic expansion  bottomed
out in the third quarter and may accelerate in the final three
months of the year as industrial output recovers, according to
Swedish bank SEB AB.  The $19 billion economy probably grew 1.5 percent from a
year earlier in the June-September period and may expand “close
to” 3 percent in the last quarter, Ruta Arumae, an economist in
Tallinn with Stockholm-based SEB, said in an e-mailed statement
today.  “September was an evident turning point for economic
growth as one of the key branches -- industrial output -- shows
the first signs of regaining footing,” Arumae wrote. A return
to industrial-production growth in September “also confirms a
forecast for improvement during the third quarter by the leading
indicators.”  Industrial production in the newest euro-area member rose
in September for the first time in seven months as demand for
its electronics exports improved, the statistics office said on
Oct. 31. Output rose 8.3 percent from a year earlier, the
biggest increase in 13 months, helped mainly by the local plant
of Stockholm-based wireless equipment maker Ericsson AB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
