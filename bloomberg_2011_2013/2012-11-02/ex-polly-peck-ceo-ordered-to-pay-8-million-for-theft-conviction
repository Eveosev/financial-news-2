Asil Nadir, the former Polly Peck
International Plc chief executive officer, was ordered to pay 5
million pounds ($8 million) to compensate victims after he was
found guilty of stealing from the company.  Nadir, who built Polly Peck from a textile company in
 London ’s East End to a FTSE 100 firm, must pay within two years
or he will face another 72 months in prison, Judge Timothy Holroyde ruled today, according to David Jones, a spokesman for
the Serious Fraud Office, which prosecuted the case.  Nadir fled the U.K. in 1993 for Northern Cyprus to avoid
trial after the company collapsed and returned 17 years later to
face the charges. He was found guilty by a London jury in August
of stealing nearly 29 million pounds from the company and
sentenced to 10 years in prison.  In sentencing Nadir, Holroyde called him “a wealthy man
who stole out of pure greed.”  Nadir’s lawyer, Giles Bark-Jones, didn’t immediately
respond to a call seeking comment about today’s ruling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
