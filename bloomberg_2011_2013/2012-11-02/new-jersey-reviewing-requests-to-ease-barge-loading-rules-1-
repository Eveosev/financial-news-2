The New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection is reviewing requests from several
facilities to allow barges to load fuel without using marine
vapor recovery equipment following  Hurricane Sandy .  “We are in the process of reviewing and granting each
individual request on a limited basis, as part of the response
to Hurricane Sandy,” Bob Considine, a spokesman for the agency
based in Trenton, said by e-mail.  Two refineries in New Jersey, operated by  Hess Corp. (HES)  and
 Phillips 66 (PSX) , remain shut four days after Sandy came ashore as a
powerful, wintry storm. AAA, the largest U.S. motoring
organization, estimated that 35 to 40 percent of stations
selling gasoline in New York City and New Jersey are open.  Hess is loading barges with gasoline at its 70,000-barrel-
a-day Port Reading plant on an emergency basis to help supply
fuel to the  New York  Harbor area, the company said in an e-
mailed statement. The refinery’s truck rack is also running on a
back-up generator to supply gasoline and diesel to stations
locally.  The company has advised New Jersey regulators that it’s
loading the barges without the use of a marine emissions
recovery unit, which was “badly damaged” during the storm,
according the e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
