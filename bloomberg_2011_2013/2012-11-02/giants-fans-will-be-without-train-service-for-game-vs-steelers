New York Giants fans will not be able
to take the New Jersey Transit train from Secaucus to MetLife
Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, for the teamâ€™s game
against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Nov. 4, team spokesman Pat
Hanlon said on Twitter.  Bus service from the Port Authority in New York will be
available. About 10,000 people take the train 2 1/4 miles to
National Football League games at the stadium from the Frank R.
Lautenberg Rail Station in Secaucus.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
