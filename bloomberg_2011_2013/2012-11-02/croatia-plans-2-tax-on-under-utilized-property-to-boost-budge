Croatia  plans to introduce next year
a 2 percent tax on property next year to narrow its  budget
deficit  and encourage owners to utilize their assets, according
to two government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.  The proposal, that is expected to be submitted within the
next 10 days, would waive 90 percent of the tax for property
occupied by the owners, and 80 percent for property that is
rented. Factors such as age and location would also be
considered.  Croatia, which is set to become the 28th member of the
European Union in July, is struggling to revive its economy
after three years of recession or stagnation. There are about
200,000 second homes in the nation of 4.2 million, according to
GfK Croatia, a market research agency. Most of them are summer
homes along the countryâ€™s 5,800 kilometer-long  Adriatic Sea 
coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
