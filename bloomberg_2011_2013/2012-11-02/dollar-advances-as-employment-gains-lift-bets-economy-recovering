The dollar advanced to a six-month
high against the yen after the last jobs report before next
week’s election showed hiring in the U.S. increased more than
forecast.  The U.S. currency strengthened to a one-month high against
the euro amid confirmation that the euro-zone’s manufacturing
sector contracted in October. Japan’s currency declined for a
third week against the dollar as economic weakness and
disappointing corporate earnings spurred speculation the  Bank of
Japan (8301)  will expand monetary stimulus. The Canadian and New
Zealand dollars rose against most peers.  “It’s been clearly positive for the dollar against its
fellow low-yielding core currencies, like the euro and the
yen,”  Richard Franulovich , a senior currency strategist at
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  in  New York , said in a telephone
interview. “It’s also good news for global growth and commodity
currencies.”  The greenback gained 0.4 percent to 80.43 yen at 5 p.m. in
New York after touching 80.68, the highest level since April 27.
It rose 0.8 percent to $1.2835 versus the shared European
currency after touching $1.2821, the strongest since Oct. 1, as
it crossed its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The yen
gained 0.5 percent to 103.24 per euro.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S.
trading partners, climbed as much as 0.7 percent to 80.610, its
highest level since Sept. 7.  Jobs Data  A net 171,000 workers were added to payrolls in October
after a 148,000 gain the prior month that was more than first
estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in Washington.
The median forecast of 91 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for an advance of 125,000. The jobless rate rose to 7.9
percent from 7.8 percent as more people entered the  labor force .  The report is “indicative of a little bit stronger pulse
in the labor market over the last couple of months,”  Nick Bennenbroek , head of currency strategy at  Wells Fargo & Co . in
New York, said in a telephone interview. “It’s probably going
to help sentiment in terms of risk-on.”  Canada’s dollar and the  Mexican peso  gained versus the
majority their 16 most-traded counterparts after the better-
than-forecast jobs data in the U.S., the largest trade partner
for both nations.  The Canadian currency rose 0.1 percent to 99.58 cents per
 U.S. dollar . The peso declined 0.2 percent to 13.0367 per
dollar.  Kiwi, Rand  The  New Zealand dollar  rose to a six-month high against
Japan’s currency, reaching 66.78 before before increasing 0.2
percent to 66.36 yen. The so-called kiwi declined 0.2 percent to
82.52 per U.S. dollar.  South Africa’s rand declined the most in over a week on
concern slowing growth will damp demand for the country’s
assets. Unemployment in Africa’s biggest economy rose in the
third quarter as mining companies eliminated jobs amid strikes.  The currency dropped 1.5 percent to 8.7700 per dollar after
falling as much as 1.8 percent, its biggest decline since Oct.
23. It fell 0.6 percent to 11.2567 per  euro .  With the presidential race four days away, a Washington
Post/ABC News national tracking poll released yesterday showed
President  Barack Obama  and Republican challenger  Mitt Romney 
essentially tied, with 49 percent of likely voters supporting
Obama and 48 percent with Romney.  Romney has said he disagrees with the  Federal Reserve ’s
measures to stimulate the economy and would replace Chairman Ben
S. Bernanke, who last week reaffirmed the central bank would
purchase $40 billion of debt a month to depress borrowing costs
and spur growth.  Fiscal Cliff  The next president will be faced with the so-called fiscal
cliff, more than $600 billion of federal spending cuts and tax
increases that will take effect at the start of next year unless
Congress acts. JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest  U.S. bank  by
assets, said last month that the combination will subtract 1
percentage point from U.S. growth.  “The biggest risk to the fiscal cliff is that an outbreak
of common sense turns it into a fiscal molehill, the economy
does better than expected next year an the transatlantic
economic divergence drives the euro down,” said Kit Juckes, the
head of foreign-exchange research at Societe Generale SA in
London.  Factories, Jobless  The U.S. currency rose yesterday against the euro and yen
after the  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory  index 
climbed to 51.7 last month, the highest since May, from 51.5 in
September. Applications for  jobless benefits  fell 9,000 to
363,000 in the week ended Oct. 27, the fewest in three weeks,
the Labor Department reported yesterday. Last week’s claims data
had yet to be influenced by the fallout from  Hurricane Sandy .  A gauge of  manufacturing  in the 17-nation euro area dropped
to 45.4 from 46.1 in September, snapping two months of advances,
London-based Markit Economics said today. That compares with an
initial October estimate of 45.3 published on Oct. 24. A reading
below 50 indicates contraction.  The euro has weakened 2.8 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The yen dropped 6.5 percent, the
biggest loser, and the dollar slid 1.7 percent.  Commerzbank AG today raised its forecasts for the euro
against the dollar through December 2013, saying weakness in the
currency will be delayed.  The Frankfurt-based bank estimates the euro will trade at
$1.30 by December this year, up from a previous forecast of
$1.23, analysts Ulrich Leuchtmann and  Ralph Solveen  wrote in an
e-mailed note. It will be at $1.23 by December 2013, from a
previous estimate of $1.16, the analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
