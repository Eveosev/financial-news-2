Construction lights on  1 World Trade
Center , blacked out by  Hurricane Sandy  four days ago, snapped on
again late yesterday.  New York  Governor  Andrew Cuomo  said
generators were filling in for crippled utilities that have left
much of lower Manhattan dark.  The construction will help return a sense of normalcy to
the area, Cuomo said at a news briefing in Manhattan. Work on
the 1,776-foot (541-meter) tower, a tribute to the victims of
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, hadn’t been expected to resume
for as long as three weeks, as power to the area slowly returns.  “You’ll see the Ground Zero site will be illuminated once
again,” Cuomo said. “New York is back to work.”  The Democratic governor had visited the site as the Hudson
River poured into it the night of Oct. 29, examining a wall that
holds back the river from seven stories underground.  “We didn’t know if the wall had been cracked and the water
was coming up from there,” Cuomo said the following day in a
radio interview. “A little voice in your head is saying, ‘Yeah,
and what if it is?’”  The wall held and pumps removed enough water for workers to
return, he said.  The  Port Authority  of New York and  New Jersey , which
oversees the metropolitan area’s airports, shipping terminals
and interstate bridges and tunnels, owns the trade center site.  To contact the reporter on this story:
