Swedbank changed its recommendation
on Apranga AB, the biggest Baltic clothing retailer, to
‘neutral’ from ‘buy’ as the company’s shares fell from a 22-
month high after it reported sales growth slowed in October.  “We estimate the decline in Latvian sales growth had the
largest impact on lower consolidated turnover growth” and was
partly due to competitor H&M opening a story in the Latvian
capital of  Riga , Swedbank said in an e-mailed remark to clients
today after trading.  Before trading, Apranga reported sales in October grew 13.4
percent from the same month last year, compared with 28.5
percent annual growth in September. Swedbank said it hadn’t
changed its forecast of 23.6 percent sales growth in 2012 or its
target price of 2.15 euros ($2.76), which was the closing price
on Oct. 31 when the shares last traded.  Apranga fell 1.4 percent today to 2.12 euros on the Nasdaq
OMX Vilnius exchange in the Lithuanian capital. Volume of 21,816
shares was just below the 12-month daily average, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
