McGraw-Hill Cos. (MHP) , the finance and
publishing firm that’s splitting in two, fell the most in almost
a year after reporting lower revenue in its education unit even
as surging corporate debt sales bolstered its ratings business.  McGraw-Hill, whose shares are still  up  21 percent this
year, fell 3.7 percent to $54.43 in  New York , the most since
November 2011 and the lowest level since Sept. 26, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue at its  education division  dropped 11 percent to
$836 million in the third quarter, the New York-based company
said today in a statement distributed by PR Newswire. Net  income 
fell to $314 million, or $1.10 a share, from $365.6 million, or
$1.21, a year earlier. Earnings excluding some items were $1.33
a share, beating the $1.31 average of analysts’  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  McGraw-Hill’s  Standard & Poor’s  unit, the largest ratings
company, reported $502 million in revenue, the highest total in
19 quarters, the firm said in the release. Companies from around
the world tapped debt markets at the fastest pace ever in a
third quarter with worldwide corporate issuance of $992.2
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue rose 2.3 percent to $1.95 billion, from $1.91
billion, Bloomberg data show. The company boosted its 2012
outlook to a range of $3.35 to $3.40 per share.  McGraw-Hill said in September 2011 it will break into two
companies, one focused on financial information including
ratings and the other on educational publishing. A decision on
the expected sale or spinoff should be finalized “in the coming
weeks,” the company said in the release.  The firm began a strategic review of its business in 2010.
Jana Partners LLC, a New York-based hedge fund and  investor  in
McGraw-Hill, proposed in August 2011 a plan to break up the
company after education sales fell for three straight quarters.  Moody’s Corp., the second-largest ratings company, reported
its highest quarterly revenue ever last week, Chief Executive
Officer Ray McDaniel said on a conference call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
