Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and  Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ)  led borrowers in the U.S. selling $15.1
billion of bonds in the busiest Friday this year as issuers
stymied by  Hurricane Sandy  try to complete deals before the  U.S.
presidential election .  Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker, sold $2.25
billion of securities in three parts and New York-based Verizon
raised $4.5 billion in its first bond sale this year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales exceed this year’s daily
average of $6.1 billion and compare with $2.9 billion on Oct.
26.  Issuers rushed to market at the end of a week shortened by
a virtual three-day hiatus amid the biggest Atlantic storm in
history. As electricity and mass transit are gradually restored,
issuers looked to lock in  record-low  borrowing costs after
today’s better-than-expected jobs report and before next week’s
presidential elections, according to Jody Lurie at Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC.  “This is a very one-time, unusual event,” Lurie, a
Philadelphia-based corporate credit analyst, said in a telephone
interview. The unemployment figures are giving borrowers “a
green light to say, ‘OK, go time, don’t wait,”’ she said.  Yields on U.S. corporate bonds reached a record-low 3.58
percent on Oct. 19 before increasing to 3.62 percent yesterday,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate &
High Yield Master index. The extra yield investors demand to own
corporate bonds rather than government debentures rose to 231
basis points from 227 basis points on Oct. 26.  Microsoft Offering  Microsoft, the manufacturer of the  Windows operating
system , sold $600 million of 0.875 percent, five-year notes at a
relative yield of 27 basis points, $750 million of 2.125
percent, 10-year securities at a spread of 47 basis points and
$900 million of 3.5 percent, 30-year debt at 67 basis points as
soon as today, Bloomberg data show. The Redmond, Washington-
based company’s bonds are rated Aaa, the highest level of
investment grade, by Moody’s Investors Service, the ratings
company said today in a statement.  Verizon, the second-largest U.S. phone company, raised $1
billion of 0.7 percent, three-year notes at a spread of 32 basis
points; $500 million of 1.1 percent, five-year debt at 42 basis
points; $1.75 billion of 2.45 percent, 10-year securities at 75
basis points; and $1.25 billion of 3.85 percent, 30-year debt at
97 basis points, Bloomberg data show.  Verizon Issue  The company last issued debt in October 2011 and proceeds
will be used to pay existing debt and for general corporate
purposes, the person said.  Following the Oct. 29 storm, power had been restored to 4.6
million customers as of yesterday, or about 45 percent of those
affected, according to the U.S. Energy Department. The outages
pose “a real, serious threat” of disruption to voting on Nov.
6 in Nassau County, New York’s largest suburban jurisdiction,
said William Biamonte, the county Democratic election
commissioner.  A  Washington  Post/ABC News national tracking poll released
yesterday showed presidential candidates  Barack Obama  and  Mitt Romney  essentially tied, with 49 percent of likely voters
supporting Obama and 48 percent with Romney.  In the last jobs report before next week’s election, a net
171,000 workers were added to payrolls in October after a
148,000 gain in September that was more than first estimated,
Labor Department figures showed today in Washington. The
increase exceeded the most optimistic forecast in a Bloomberg
survey in which the median called for an advance of 125,000. The
 unemployment rate  rose to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent.  Accelerating Funding  “Companies are trying to take advantage of the current
low-rate environment, in case there is a shift in the yield
curve after the elections,” Alan Shepard, an analyst at
Madison, Wisconsin-based Madison Investment Holdings Inc., which
oversees about $16 billion, wrote in an e-mail. For firms in
need of financing, “they may be accelerating their funding to
get it in now, in an environment that is known, rather than do
the funding at a potentially higher cost in a more uncertain
environment post-election,” he said.  Aetna Inc. (AET) , the third-biggest U.S. health insurer, sold $2
billion of debt split into $500 million of 1.5 percent, five-
year notes at a spread of 88 basis points, $1 billion of 2.75
percent, 10-year securities at 123 basis points and $500 million
of 4.125 percent, 30-year debt at 133 basis points, Bloomberg
data show. Proceeds will be used to help finance the company’s
purchase of Coventry Health Care Inc.  Clear Channel  In addition to today’s sales, Clear Channel Communications
Inc. plans to raise $2.73 billion next week through a unit of
its Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings business, the San Antonio-
based company said today in a statement. Proceeds will fund a
tender offer for as much as $2.5 billion of shorter-term
securities.  Clear Channel Worldwide, which manages advertising
displays, will offer about $736 million of 10-year series A
senior notes and about $2 billion of similar-maturity series B
bonds. Pricing is set for Nov. 5, according to a person familiar
with the transaction who asked not to be identified because the
terms are private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
