Gasoline strengthened on the Gulf
Coast on speculation the Obama administration’s waiver of the
Jones Act will boost product shipments to the U.S. East Coast as
refineries remain shut after  Hurricane Sandy .  The administration suspended the requirement that allows
only U.S.-flagged ships to move between the country’s ports. The
waiver comes as  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Bayway refinery and  Hess Corp. (HES) ’s
Port Reading plant remain shut four days after Sandy, the
largest Atlantic superstorm on record, made landfall in southern
New Jersey Oct. 29.  Reformulated gasoline to be blended with ethanol on the
Gulf Coast strengthened 4.87 cents to a discount of 9.13 cents a
gallon below futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 3:54 p.m., a third consecutive gain.  Bayway and Port Reading have a combined capacity of 308,000
barrels a day, or about 24 percent of East Coast refining,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Gasoline supplies in
the U.S. Northeast dropped by 202,000 barrels to 47.9 million in
the week ended Oct. 26, the Energy Department reported
yesterday.  Reformulated gasoline to be blended with ethanol in  New
York  Harbor was unchanged for the fourth day at 4.25 cents a
gallon above futures.  Spot gasoline in California was also unchanged, at an 8-
cent-a-gallon premium to futures in  Los Angeles  and a 3.5-cent-
a-gallon discount in  San Francisco .  Conventional, 84-octane gasoline to be blended with ethanol
in Portland, Oregon, held at a discount of 21.5 cents a gallon
against futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
