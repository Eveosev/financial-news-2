Asian  stocks  rose after reports on
U.S. employment and manufacturing topped estimates and
confidence among American consumers climbed to a four-year high.
A gauge of Chinese shares listed in Hong Kong rallied 20 percent
from a September low, entering a  bull market .  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company,
climbed 1.8 percent.  Sands China Ltd. (1928) , the Macau casino operator
controlled by billionaire  Sheldon Adelson , gained 6.3 percent as
spending by middle-class Chinese gamblers boosted profit 17
percent.  Sharp Corp. (6753)  slid 2.4 percent after the TV maker
forecast a record loss and said there was “material doubt”
about its survival.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.8 percent to 122.71 as
of 7:18 p.m. in Tokyo. The gauge climbed 7 percent this year
through yesterday as central banks around the world boosted
stimulus to support economic growth. The measure has risen 1
percent this week.  “Global indicators are starting to show an improvement in
momentum, particularly in the U.S.,” said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-
based head of dynamic asset allocation at AMP Capital Investors
Ltd., which manages almost $100 billion. “This can be sustained
if central banks keep supporting growth.”  Raw-material producers and industrial companies gained the
most today among the 10 groups on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.
Stocks on the measure traded for 13.2 times average  estimated
earnings , compared with 13.7 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
and 12.3 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Nikkei 225  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  gained 1.2 percent,

percent and Taiwan’s Taiex added 0.3 percent.  The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.4 percent.  Hong Kong ’s

2011.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies
listed in Hong Kong advanced 1.2 percent, with the gauge closing
20 percent higher than on Sept. 5, marking the start of a bull
market. Shares have risen on speculation  China’s economy  may be
stabilizing.  Futures on the  S&P 500  were little changed today. The gauge
yesterday gained 1.1 percent, its biggest advance in seven
weeks.  U.S. Jobs  American companies expanded payrolls in October by the most
in eight months, the Institute for Supply Management’s U.S.
factory index topped estimates, and a measure of consumer
sentiment rose to the highest since February 2008, reports
showed yesterday.  Today’s monthly report from the Labor Department will
provide a last snapshot of the U.S. jobs market before next
week’s presidential election. Payrolls probably increased by
125,000 workers in October and the  unemployment rate  rose to 7.9
percent, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed

the second-biggest maker of construction and mining equipment,

biggest consumer-electronics exporter maintained its full-year
profit forecast. The maker of Bravia TVs and PlayStation game
machines is cutting 10,000 jobs and selling assets as Chief

electric machinery, soared 6.6 percent to 306 yen as first-half
profit topped  analyst estimates .  Sands China added 6.3 percent to HK$31.90. Earnings grew 17
percent after the opening of a new resort in April on Macau’s
popular Cotai strip, allowing the company to attract more
Chinese tourists in the world’s largest gambling hub.  Among declining shares, Sharp slid 2.4 percent to 165 yen
after saying its  net loss  will probably widen to 450 billion yen
in the year ending March 31, scrapping an earlier projection for
a 250 billion-yen loss. Sharp follows Panasonic Corp. in
predicting losses that exceeded analysts estimates after losing
ground to Samsung Electronics Co. in TVs.  Earnings at 58 percent of companies on the  MSCI Asia
Pacific Index (MXAP)  that have reported quarterly results since Oct. 1
 missed profit estimates , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Nikon Corp. retreated 6.1 percent to 1,928 yen in Tokyo,
the most in almost three months, as the camera maker cut its
