Bulgaria completed the sale of
minority stakes in two local units of  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the largest Czech
utility, for about 115 million lev ($76 million).  The state sold its 33 percent stakes in CEZ Razpredelenie
Bulgaria, the power distribution unit, and in CEZ Electro
Bulgaria, the grid operating unit, on the Bulgarian Stock
Exchange, the asset-selling agency in Sofia said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Central Cooperative Bank AD (4CF)  was the manager.  The sold assets were the government’s last minority stakes
in seven power distributors, which it sold in 2005 to  Germany ’s
E.ON AG, CEZ and  EVN AG (EVN)  in the run-up to joining the European
Union.  CEZ controls the power companies that serve Sofia, the
capital, and the northern city of Pleven, which together account
for 41 percent of  Bulgaria ’s electricity consumers.  Bulgaria also sold minority stakes in the two units
controlled by EVN for about 93 million lev 10 months ago and got
about 70 million lev from selling minority stakes in the two
companies run by Czech utility Energo-Pro last month.  E.ON sold its Bulgarian companies to Energo-Pro last year.  Bulgaria, which weathered the global crisis without
borrowing from international lenders, is working to cut the
budget gap to 1.3 percent of gross domestic product this year,
after a 2.1 percent deficit in 2011, to help contain the impact
from the euro-area crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
