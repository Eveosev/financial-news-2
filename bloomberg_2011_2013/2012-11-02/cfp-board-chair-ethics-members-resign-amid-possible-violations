The chairman of the group that
certifies financial planners and two members of its ethics
committee resigned over allegations that they may have violated
professional-conduct standards.  Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards Inc.
Chairman Alan Goldfarb and two members of the organization’s
disciplinary and ethics commission, who weren’t identified,
stepped down after being accused of violating conduct rules, the
Washington-based board said today in a statement.  The alleged violation involved how Goldfarb characterized
his own income, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier today,
citing an e-mail from the former chairman.  “The committee found sufficient merit in the allegations
against Mr. Goldfarb and the two members of the DEC to refer
them for further proceedings under CFP Board’s disciplinary
rules and procedures,” according to the statement. “When
presented with the committee’s findings, they decided to resign
from their positions.”  Goldfarb, a certified financial planner with Weaver Wealth
Management in  Dallas , didn’t immediately respond to phone and e-
mail messages. He said in a  letter  released by the group that he
believes he was in compliance with the ethics standards, which
he helped write.  “I am certain that this was a misunderstanding and I
welcome the opportunity to engage in good faith the CFP Board’s
enforcement process consistent with its disciplinary rules and
procedures,” he said in the letter dated Oct. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
