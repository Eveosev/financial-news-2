Manchester United captain Nemanja
Vidic won’t return from a knee injury until late December,
manager  Alex Ferguson  said.  Vidic underwent knee surgery in September and was expected
to be sidelined for eight weeks.  “I think we’re talking around December for Vidic,”
Ferguson told United’s television network. “Maybe around
Christmas time.”  Vidic missed the final five months of last season after
rupturing a cruciate ligament in his knee during a Champions
League game at Basel.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
