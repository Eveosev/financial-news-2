Swiss stocks  advanced for a second
day, with the benchmark index completing the biggest weekly
rally in almost a month, as a U.S. report showed hiring in the
world’s biggest economy increased more than forecast in October.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, the owner of the Cartier
brand, climbed to the highest in at least 22 years.  Emmi (EMMN)  AG rose
2.2 percent to an all-time high.  Schmolz & Bickenbach (STLN)  AG plunged
15 percent after the maker of high-grade steel products reduced
its earnings forecast.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  gained 0.6 percent to 6,701.37 at
the close in Zurich, extending this week’s advance to 1.5
percent. The gauge has  rallied 17 percent  from this year’s low
on June 4 as European Central Bank policy makers agreed on an
unlimited bond-buying plan and the Federal Reserve announced a
third round of quantitative easing. The Swiss Performance Index
also rose 0.6 percent today.  “The U.S. employment numbers have overall turned out more
positive than expected,” Bernd Krampen, an economist at
Norddeutsche Landesbank in Hanover,  Germany , wrote in a report.
“The brightening of the labor market continues, with slightly
bigger momentum.”  The SMI gained this week amid better-than-projected company
earnings and economic reports from the U.S. and  China  that beat
forecasts. The number of shares changing hands in the SMI was 44
percent higher than the 30-day average today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. employers added 171,000 workers to payrolls last month
after a 148,000 gain in September that was more than first
estimated, Labor Department figures showed today. The  median
forecast  of 91 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an
advance of 125,000. The  jobless rate  rose to 7.9 percent from
7.8 percent as more people entered the labor force.  Richemont, Swatch  Richemont climbed 2.9 percent to 65.20 Swiss francs, the
highest price since at least 1990, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Swatch Group AG (UHR) , the world’s biggest watchmaker,
added 2.8 percent to 415.30 francs. A gauge of personal and
household-goods makers was the best performer among the 19
industry groups in the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index. (SXXP)   Emmi gained 2.2 percent to 238 francs, the highest since
the company sold shares to the public in 2004, after UBS raised
the dairy producer to buy from neutral.  Schmolz & Bickenbach plummeted 15 percent to 3.03 francs,
the lowest since January 2004, as the company said it no longer
forecasts slightly positive earnings before taxes this year.  “As we feared, industry fundamentals did not improve in
the second half of 2012 -- and even got worse,” Patrick Rafaisz, an analyst at Vontobel Holding AG in Zurich, wrote in a
note to clients today. “More restructuring charges and a cap
hike could loom in 2013. It is time that the company comes up
with more drastic measures in order to tidy up the balance
sheet. For the time being, the stock is a no-go for investors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
