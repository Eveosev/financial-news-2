Vietnam ’s government bonds rose for a
second week on speculation a decline in stocks and surplus funds
at banks boosted demand. The dong was little changed.  The yield on five-year notes dropped one basis point to
10.09 percent, the least since Sept. 26, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The rate declined 12
basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, this week. The  VN Index (VNINDEX) 
of shares fell 3.3 percent to the lowest level in nine months.
The gauge has fallen 23 percent from this year peak reached May
8 as slowing economic growth hurt corporate earnings.  “Demand for bonds has increased due to declines in other
investment channels such as stocks and interbank lending
rates,” said Nguyen Tan Thang, fixed-income investment director
at Ho Chi Minh City Securities Joint-Stock Co. “Some banks have
surplus cash as well.”  Fund supply in the banking system has improved after
lenders bought 60 metric tons of gold from the public since May
and converted into cash, central bank Governor Nguyen Van Binh
told lawmakers in Hanoi Oct. 31.  The dong traded at 20,850 per dollar, compared with 20,848
yesterday and 20,840 at the end of last week, according to data
from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set
the currency’s reference rate at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26,
according to its website. The dong is allowed to trade as much
as 1 percent on either side of the rate.  The  overnight interbank deposit rate  fell eight basis
points to 2.42 percent. It has dropped from this year’s high of
12.74 percent touched on Jan. 30.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
