Temperatures in the U.S. Northeast
are expected to rise above normal by mid-November, which may
crimp demand for natural gas and heating oil.  Daily average temperatures from Maine to Virginia may be
about 3 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 Celsius) above normal Nov.
12-16, which may be high enough to keep overnight heating demand
low, said Matt Rogers, president of Commodity Weather Group LLC
in Bethesda, Maryland.  November signals the start of the traditional heating
season for the large population centers of the northern U.S.,
when demand peaks for energy to heat homes and businesses.
Normal daily average temperatures have dropped into the mid-40s
from Chicago to  Boston  and will continue to fall until reaching
their low point in January.  Blackouts caused by  Hurricane Sandy  diminished demand in
the Northeast this week.  -- Editors:  Charlotte  Porter, Dan Stets  To contact the reporter on this story:
