Canada’s  unemployment rate  remained
at 7.4 percent in October as job growth slowed, with gains in
public-sector work curbed by a decline in agriculture.  Employment rose by 1,800 following September’s 52,100 gain,
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News  projected job creation of 10,000 and 7.4 percent
unemployment, according to median of 23 forecasts.  The report is the second this week signaling a tepid
expansion toward the end of the year. Statistics Canada said two
days ago that gross domestic product shrank for the first time
in six months in August on mining maintenance shutdowns and
lower factory production. Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  cut
economic growth and revenue projections on Oct. 29 on signs of
global weakness.  “Labor market conditions are likely to remain difficult in
the months ahead,” said Matthieu Arseneau, senior economist at
 National Bank of Canada (NA)  in  Montreal . Gains in public sector work
such as education are “unsustainable” with several provinces
cutting spending next year, he said in a client note.  Employment in the public sector grew by 36,900 last month
while private companies cut 20,300 jobs,  Statistics Canada  said.
Agriculture employment declined by 16,200, while education jobs
rose by the same amount.  Dollar Gains  The  Canadian dollar  was little changed at 99.61 cents per
 U.S. dollar  at 10:32 a.m. in Toronto, after weakening as much as
0.2 percent before the report. Non-farm payrolls in the U.S.
rose by 171,000 workers, more than economists forecast, a Labor
Department report in Washington showed.  Canada’s part-time employment fell by 5,500 in October
while full-time positions rose by 7,300, according to the
report. Workers designated by Statistics Canada as self-employed
decreased by 14,900 in October while employees rose by 16,600.  Average hourly  earnings  of permanent employees rose 3.9
percent in October from a year earlier, exceeding the prior
reading of 3.3 percent.  Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ) , the snacks and coffee business
spun off from Kraft Foods Inc., said yesterday it’s closing a
biscuit bakery in Toronto that employs 550 people.  Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  told lawmakers two days
ago that “slack” remains in the labor market more than three
years after the world’s 11th largest economy emerged from a
recession. Carney has kept his key lending rate at 1 percent in
the longest pause since the 1950s as Europe’s debt crisis and
slow U.S. growth restrain exports.  Unemployment will average 7.2 percent next year and 6.8
percent in 2014, according to a Bloomberg economist survey.  “There are still too many Canadians looking for work and
we are committed to keep supporting the economy,” Flaherty said
in a statement from Ottawa today. “We face challenges from
economic turbulence beyond our borders especially in Europe and
the  United States .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
