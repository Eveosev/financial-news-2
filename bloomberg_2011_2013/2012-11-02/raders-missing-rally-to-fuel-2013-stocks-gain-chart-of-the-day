Equities are poised to advance in
2013 as investors who missed this year’s gains try to chase the
rally, according to Exane BNP Paribas.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows strategists’ recommended levels
of stock holdings, as compiled by Bloomberg, compared with the
performance of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The suggested
investment in shares was a record low 41 percent of portfolios
in June and July, just as the gauge started a 12 percent surge.  A reversal of investor pessimism, near-zero U.S.  interest
rates , accelerating economic growth and favorable market
valuations will boost stocks, said Graham Bishop, an equity
strategist at Exane. He recommended buying European shares in
January before an 11 percent gain in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
The gauge is trading at 1.34 times the book value of its
constituents, according to Bloomberg data. That compares with
about 1.9 times in the past decade.  “This phase of the cycle tends to support a strong equity
performance,” the London-based strategist wrote in his 2013
outlook published Oct. 29. “With valuations still low, markets
can benefit from further multiple expansions as extreme risk
aversion alleviates and low interest rates pull the cost of
equities lower.”  Strategists’ recommended position on bonds rose to a record
39.8 percent in June, according to Bloomberg data. The average
suggested allocation to cash this year has been 6.7 percent. The
value of S&P 500 shares that changed hands on a monthly basis
fell in August to the lowest since at least 1998, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
