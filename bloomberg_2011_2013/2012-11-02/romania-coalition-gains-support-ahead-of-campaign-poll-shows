Romania ’s governing collation gained
public support in October for the first time since a failed
attempt to oust President Traian Basescu prompted the decline in
polls, a survey published by  Adevarul  newspaper shows.  The Social Liberal Union, backing Prime Minister Victor Ponta, would win 57.4 percent of the votes in parliamentary
elections, according to a survey of 1,039 people between Oct. 10
and Oct. 18 by polling company IMAS. That compares with 48
percent in a CSOP survey published on Oct. 1 and with a 54
percent in an IRES survey published on Aug. 27.  The opposition  Liberal Democratic Party , which formed the
Right Romania Alliance with two other parties, including the
party headed by former Prime Minister Mihai-Razvan Ungureanu,
would garner 16 percent, down from 24 percent in the CSOP poll.  A campaign for general elections starts next week, a month
before the Dec. 9 ballot. Romania has been embroiled in a power
struggle between Basescu and Ponta from June to August, which
led to the president’s suspension. He was reinstated after a
vote to oust him was invalidated by the  Constitutional Court 
because of lower-than-required turnout.  The  People’s Party , founded by media entrepreneur Dan
Diaconescu, would get the backing of 14.9 percent of the voters,
the poll showed. The survey has a margin of error of 3
percentage points, according to Adevarul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
