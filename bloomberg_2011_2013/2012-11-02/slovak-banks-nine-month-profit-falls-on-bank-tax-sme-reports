Nine-month net income at Slovak
commercial banks fell 30 percent to 414.3 million euros ($534.3
million) as lenders were hurt by a new bank levy,  Sme  reported,
citing the Slovak Banking Association.  The levy on client deposits, in place since January,
reduced profit by 69 million euros, the newspaper said. Results
were also affected by declining interest-rate margins as
competition rose, Sme said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
