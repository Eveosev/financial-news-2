James Haskell  returns to the England
rugby team starting lineup for this weekend’s Six Nations match
against Ireland.  Haskell will start at blindside flanker for the game in
Dublin in two days, with Tom Wood moving to No. 8 in place of
the injured  Ben Morgan . It’s the only starting change from last
weekend’s opening 38-18 win over Scotland.  Haskell will be making his first Six Nations start since
the final game of the 2011 championship in Dublin. He missed
last year’s tournament in order to play in New Zealand.  Manu Tuilagi  returns from an ankle injury but will be on
the bench with  Billy Twelvetrees , who scored a try in his
international debut last week, starting at inside-center.
Tuilagi replaces  David Strettle  among the substitutes, while
Thomas Waldrom fills the gap left by Haskell’s promotion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
