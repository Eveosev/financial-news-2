U.S.  beef  output will slide this year
after a prolonged drought, sending cattle prices to all-time
highs, according to industry researcher CattleFax.  Production of the meat will drop 2.4 percent as cattle
slaughter falls, and per-capita beef supplies may slide 2.3
percent to 56.1 pounds, according to CattleFax. Average  prices 
for all classes of cattle will climb to all-time highs this
year, the researcher forecast.  Cattle futures in Chicago have climbed for four straight
years, surging 54 percent since the end of 2008 to Dec. 31 as
the U.S. herd shrank. The worst U.S. drought since the 1930s
boosted the cost of feed for livestock last year. Improving
weather this year and higher prices may help to increase the
number of animals by 2014, CattleFax said.  “The economic incentive is there to expand,”  Kevin Good ,
a market analyst at CattleFax, said during a presentation at an
industry convention in Tampa, Florida. “We do expect to see
some of that as soon as Mother Nature cooperates.”  Fed-cattle cash prices may average $1.26 a pound this year,
up 2.4 percent from 2012, and cash prices for a 750-pound (340
kilograms) steer may average $1.55 a pound, up 5.8 percent, the
researcher said. Calf prices will average $1.75, up 4.8 percent.  All fresh retail-beef prices may average $4.85 a pound this
year, up 4 percent from 2012, CattleFax said. U.S. demand for
wholesale beef demand may drop 2 percent, while exports rise 3
percent driven by demand in emerging countries, Mike Murphy, a
CattleFax market analyst said during a presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
