Copper futures rose the most in a
week as China’s trade expanded more than forecast, and car sales
jumped to a record in the Asian nation, the world’s biggest
consumer of industrial metals.  In January, exports from China surged 25 percent and
imports climbed 29 percent from a year earlier, both topping
projections by economists in Bloomberg surveys, government data
showed today. Sales of passenger vehicles surged 49 percent, a
state-backed trade group said.  “The Chinese data signals that business continues to pick
up,”  Harry Denny , a broker at Hoboken, New Jersey-based PVM
Futures Inc., said in a telephone interview. “Copper is being
supported by overall optimism on a recovery.”  Copper futures for March delivery rose 0.9 percent to
settle at $3.7595 a pound at 1:15 p.m. on the Comex in New York,
the biggest gain for a most-active contract since Feb. 1.  The International Copper Study Group says an average
midsize car contains about 50 pounds of the metal.  Financial markets in China will close next week for the
Lunar New Year. Imports of copper rose 2.9 percent in January
from December, customs data showed today.  Stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell
to 196,699 metric tons, the lowest in more than three months.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months climbed 1.1 percent to $8,294 a ton ($3.76 a pound).
Aluminum, zinc tin, lead and nickel also gained.  To contact the reporters on this story:
