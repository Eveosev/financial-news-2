Farmers in Russia, the third-biggest
 wheat exporter  last season, will plant more corn and oilseeds in
the Black Earth area for 2013-14 in search of higher profits.  Farmers began to focus more on feed-type grains in the
central Black Earth regions because wheat yields there are lower
and transportation to export ports more expensive than in
southern regions, according to  Oleg Sukhanov , an analyst at the
Moscow-based Institute for Agricultural Market Studies, or Ikar.  Corn typically gives bigger yields in the area’s fertile
soils than in the south, and has a ready market in the livestock
farms that are clustered in the vicinity, Sukhanov said
yesterday by phone in Moscow. Corn yields in the Belgorod region
were 6.2 metric tons a hectare (2.47 acres) this season,
compared with about 5 tons a hectare in the southern Stavropol
region, according to the regions’ agricultural ministries.  “It’s a trend in central Russia,” Sukhanov said. “That
is why we have had record corn harvests in the past two years.”  Russia’s corn crop was 8 million tons in 2012, beating the
previous record of 7 million tons in 2011, according to state
statistics data. Russia may be the seventh-largest corn exporter
in the 2012-13 season, after the U.S., Argentina, Brazil,
Ukraine, India and South Africa, shipping 2.3 million tons, 13
percent more than the previous year, according to U.S.
Department of Agriculture estimates. The country produced 37.7
million tons of wheat in 2012-13, a 33 percent plunge to a nine-
year low, after drought curbed production.  Sowing Structure  Corn futures gained 8 percent on the Chicago Board of Trade
last year, reaching a record $8.49 a bushel in August. Global
corn production may total 845 million tons in the
2012-13 season, the London-based International Grains Council
said Jan. 17, some 3.6 percent less than a year earlier.
Inventories may drop to 113 million tons by the end of
the season, the lowest in nine years, according to the IGC.  “We are changing the sowing structure in general this year
toward more energy effective grains like corn and soybeans and
will expand their fields further,”  Yevgeny Savchenko , Belgorod
governor, told Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  during a video-
conference on Feb. 5. Tambov, another Black Earth region, will
double its corn plantings for the 2013-14 crop, Governor Oleg
Betin said at the same meeting, without giving specific figures.
Sowing typically starts in April in the Black Earth area.  Wheat added 19 percent in 2012, climbing to the highest in
almost four years in July, as drought damaged crops from the
U.S. to Europe. World production of wheat may be 656 million
tons in 2012-13, less than the previous year’s harvest at 696
million tons, according to the IGC, which forecast inventories
to fall 22 million tons from the previous year to 174 million
tons.  The Black Earth area accounted for 20 percent of Russia’s
national grains crop after harvesting about 14 million tons of
grains this season, according to state statistics data. The area
includes the regions of Belgorod, Voronezh, Kursk, Lipetsk,
Oryol and Tambov.  To contact the reporter on this story:
