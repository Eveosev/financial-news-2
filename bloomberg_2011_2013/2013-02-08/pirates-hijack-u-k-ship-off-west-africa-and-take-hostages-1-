Pirates hijacked a U.K.-flagged
merchant ship off West Africa and seized three members of its
crew as hostages before departing, said Carisbrooke Shipping
Ltd., the vessel’s operator.  The Esther C was boarded yesterday evening in international
waters in the Gulf of Guinea, Cowes, England-based Carisbrooke
said in a statement distributed today by e-mail by MTI Network.
The ship carries general cargo and has a capacity of 8,063
deadweight tons, the company’s website shows.  The vessel is back under the captain’s command and the
remaining nine crew members are reported to be safe, according
to the statement. The ship called at ports in Cameroon and
Equatorial Guinea before the attack, vessel-tracking data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The safety and well-being of these seafarers is the
company’s absolute priority and all possible steps to secure
their return are being taken,” Carisbrooke said in the
statement, referring to the hostages.  The closely held company has 71 ships, of which 32 are
flagged in the U.K. according to its website and figures from
IHS Fairplay, a provider of maritime data.  The largest oil tankers operating in the region, which haul
loads of more than 2 million barrels of crude, are more than 35
times bigger than the seized vessel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
