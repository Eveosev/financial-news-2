India’s rupee headed for the biggest
weekly drop since December after the government predicted
economic growth will slow to the least in a decade.  Gross domestic product will increase 5 percent in the year
through March 31, the least since 2002-2003, according to a
Central Statistical Office statement released in New Delhi
yesterday. The median of 34 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
was 5.5 percent. India’s current-account deficit widened to a
record in the quarter through September and the nation has the
biggest budget shortfall among the largest emerging markets.  The rupee declined 0.6 percent today and this week to
53.5150 per dollar as of 9:30 a.m. in Mumbai, the biggest drop
since the five days through Dec. 21, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The currency touched 52.89 on Feb. 6, the
strongest level since Oct. 17, prompting importers to buy
dollars, according to Federal Bank Ltd.  The GDP projection is “raising concerns about how the
government would fund its twin deficits,” analysts at Edelweiss
Financial Advisors Ltd., including Mumbai-based Vinay Khattar,
wrote in a research report today. Technical charts indicate the
rupee may drop to 53.75 and 54 in coming days, they wrote.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the exchange rate used to price options, fell 57 basis points,
or 0.57 percentage point, this week to 9.38 percent. The rate
rose four basis points today.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 54.59 per
dollar, compared with 54.27 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 54.44 versus 54.13. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
