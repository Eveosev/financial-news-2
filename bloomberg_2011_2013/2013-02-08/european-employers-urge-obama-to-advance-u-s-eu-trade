The BusinessEurope employers’
federation called on President  Barack Obama  to advance trade
talks with the European Union in his Feb. 12 State of the Union
address.  A trade deal between the world’s largest economies would
“boost economic growth and help create much-needed
employment,” BusinessEurope President  Juergen Thumann  said in a
letter released today in Brussels. He said trans-Atlantic trade
ties generate $5 trillion in annual sales and would benefit from
a closer alliance as they compete with fast-growing emerging
economies.  The U.S. and the EU are working on a report that will lay
out their strategy for the next steps on a trade deal. The EU
has called for work to proceed quickly, while U.S. officials
caution that talks shouldn’t start without clearer signals that
a deal can overcome entrenched disagreements.  “We should try to do it on one tank of gas and avoid
protracted rounds of negotiations,” U.S. Vice President  Joe Biden  said in Munich on Feb. 2. “The question now is whether
the political will exists to resolve those longstanding
differences.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
