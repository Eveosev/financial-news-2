Commissioned along with  Leonardo da Vinci  in 1504 to paint a battle scene on the wall of the Great
Council Hall in Florence,  Michelangelo  jumped at the chance.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  In his depiction of the 1364 Battle of Cascina, a decisive
Florentine victory against the Pisans, he chose the ambush at
the beginning.  Surprised while bathing in the Arno, naked men are leaping
from the water, struggling to find clothes and armor. Graceful
backs, smooth buttocks, muscular arms and legs entwine in one
great intimate pile of sensual masculine flesh.  Michelangelo was intoxicated with the male body and became
the first major painter to transfigure the erotic into art.  Neither finished his fresco, but the preliminary drawings
and cartoons have been copied many times, reshaping cultural
history.  I spoke with  Jonathan Jones , author of “The Lost Battles:
Leonardo, Michelangelo and the Artistic Duel That Defined the
Renaissance,” on the following topics:  1. Medicis Overthrown  2. Leonardo’s Mona Lisa  3. Michelangelo’s David  4. Competitive Florence  5. Missing Cartoons  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
