Google Inc.  Chairman  Eric Schmidt  is
adopting a plan to sell as many as 3.2 million shares in the
operator of the world’s most popular search engine.  The planned share sales, worth about $2.5 billion, are for
Schmidt’s individual asset diversification and liquidity,
Mountain View, California-based Google said in a filing
yesterday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The plan represents 42 percent of Schmidt’s share holdings.
He had 7.6 million Class A and B shares as of Dec. 31, and has
also adopted separate share sale plans for his investment
companies.  “This is a routine diversification of assets and Eric
remains completely committed to Google,”  Niki Fenwick , a
spokeswoman for Google, said in an e-mail.  Sales may take place over a maximum period of a year, the
filing said. Google rose 1.5 percent to $785.37 at yesterday’s
close in New York, leaving them up 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
