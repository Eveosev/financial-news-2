Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA 
cut the remuneration of Chairman  Francisco Gonzalez  by a fifth
to about 4 million euros ($5.36 million) last year.  That included 1.97 million euros in fixed pay and 1 million
euros in variable pay, Spainâ€™s second-biggest bank said in its
2012 corporate governance report filed with regulators today.
Gonzalez was also awarded 155,479 shares, valued at about 1
million euros, the Bilbao, Spain-based lender said.  President and Chief Operating Officer  Angel Cano  earned
1.75 million euros in fixed and 636,000 euros in variable pay,
plus about 635,863 euros of stock, the bank said. Gonzalez
earned about 5 million euros in fixed and variable pay in 2011,
while Cano received 3.64 million euros.  BBVA reported a decline in full-year profit to 1.68 billion
euros on Feb. 1, from 3 billion euros in 2011, as the bank set
aside provisions for cleaning up Spanish real estate assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
