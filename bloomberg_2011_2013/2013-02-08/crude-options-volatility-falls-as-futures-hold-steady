Crude oil options volatility fell as
the underlying futures were little changed.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 20.1 percent at 4:10 p.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, down from 20.3 yesterday. Crude oil for
April delivery dipped 8 cents to $96.26 a barrel on the Nymex.
The more-active March futures dropped 11 cents to $95.72.  West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark for Nymex futures,
widened its discount to Brent oil after Chinaâ€™s crude imports
climbed to an eight-month high, signaling greater demand. The
discount has widened since Jan. 31, when Enterprise Product
Partners LP said capacity on its Seaway pipeline to the Gulf
Coast from Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for the New
York contract, will be limited until late this year.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
March $95 puts. They slid 11 cents to 66 cents a barrel on
volume of 3,288 contracts. The second-most active were March $98
calls, which declined 10 cents to 19 cents a barrel, with 2,126
lots exchanged. March options expire on Feb. 14.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 56
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs. In the
previous session, puts accounted for 60 percent of volume.  March $95 puts were the most active traded options
yesterday, with 5,328 contracts. They climbed 11 cents to 77
cents a barrel. April $110 calls dropped 2 cents to 10 cents a
barrel on 4,369 lots.  Open interest was highest for March $85 puts with 42,677
contracts. Next were March $110 calls at 40,863 and March $115
calls at 30,934.  To contact the reporter on this story:
