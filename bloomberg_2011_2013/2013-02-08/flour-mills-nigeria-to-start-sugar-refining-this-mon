Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc, the
country’s biggest miller by market value, said it will begin
commercial sugar refining this month to boost revenue.  “Construction work on the 750,000 metric ton capacity
plant is completed and a test run done in December,” Chief
Financial Officer Jacques Vauthier told a conference call in
Lagos, the commercial capital.  Nigeria plans to end imports of packaged sugar from this
year to boost local investment and become a self sufficient
producer of the sweetener, Lateef Busari, executive secretary of
the National Sugar Development Council, said Dec. 20. Imports of
raw sugar for refining will be approved by President  Goodluck Jonathan  only on recommendations from the Trade and Investment
Minister, Busari said.  Flour Mills wants to buy a sugar plantation to reduce the
cost of providing raw materials for its plant, Vauthier said.
“The company’s working capital has risen as a result of buying
in stock of raw sugar ahead of the refinery start up.”  Flour Mills net income advanced less than one percent to
8.2 billion naira ($52 million) for the nine months through
December, it said in a Jan. 31 statement. Revenue rose 1.6
percent to 205.5 billion naira.  The stock was unchanged at 80 naira in Lagos at market
close today. It has risen 23 percent this year, compared with a
19 percent rise in the  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index .  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
