Hugo Boss AG , the luxury-clothing
maker controlled by Permira Advisers LLP, reported fourth-
quarter operating profit that topped analysts’ estimates, driven
by growth at its wholesale business and store openings.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization
and one-time items gained 42 percent to 138 million euros
($184.9 million), the Metzingen, Germany-based company said
today. The  average analyst estimate  was 129 million euros,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 22 percent
to 607 million euros. Hugo Boss said wholesale growth was
“double-digit.”  “We expect own retail sales to benefit from new stores,
franchise acquisitions and concession takeovers,”  Claus Roller ,
an London-based analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote
in a report to investors today. “Higher frequency of new
product deliveries and a new pricing architecture should help
gross margin.” He recommends clients buy the stock.  Hugo Boss has forecast full-year revenue of 3 billion euros
and Ebitda of 750 million euros in 2015 as it opens more stores
and expands in Asia and the U.S. The company plans to increase
the size of its retail operations to 55 percent of revenue by
2015 from about 45 percent now.  “The positive business performance in 2012 has brought us
a good step closer to achieving our medium-term targets,” Chief
Executive Officer  Claus-Dietrich Lahrs  said in a statement
today. “Despite the still-challenging market environment, I am
confident that we will continue to post stronger growth than the
overall market in 2013.”  Shares Gain  Hugo Boss shares gained 1 percent to 87.59 euros as of
10:10 a.m. in Frankfurt.  Fourth-quarter net income gained 30 percent to 70 million
euros. The gross margin narrowed to 64.5 percent of sales in the
fourth quarter from 66.2 percent a year earlier.  Hugo Boss shares jumped 45 percent last year, compared with
a 34 percent increase for the  MDAX index . Hugo Boss is trading
at around 17 times its 2013  estimated earnings , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg, while Prada SpA and Ralph Lauren
Corp. are priced at about 22 times their estimated earnings.
Hugo Boss’s discount compared with its premium-apparel peers
isn’t justified, said Merrill Lynch’s Roller.  Buyout firm Permira, based in London, acquired a majority
holding in the Valentino Fashion Group in 2007. Valentino was
Hugo Boss’s parent company at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
