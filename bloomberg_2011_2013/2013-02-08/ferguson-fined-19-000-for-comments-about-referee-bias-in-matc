Manchester United manager Alex
Ferguson was fined 12,000 pounds ($19,000) for comments after a
soccer match with Tottenham that implied a match official was
motivated by bias.  The fine was announced by England’s Football Association
today on its website. Ferguson had appealed the charge.  Referee Chris Foy didn’t award a penalty to United, the
league leaders, when Wayne Rooney felt he was fouled in the Jan.
20 game, which finished 1-1 as Spurs scored late. The manager
criticized linesman Simon Beck in post-match comments, saying
he’d failed to make rulings that support United in several
games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
