The California State Teachers’
Retirement System, the second-biggest public pension in the
U.S., said its investments returned 13.5 percent in 2012 on
gains in stocks, private equity and real estate.  The $158 billion fund’s calendar-year earnings missed its
target of 15.4 percent, it said in a statement yesterday. U.S.
stock holdings rose 16 percent, while bonds returned 6.1
percent. Real estate earned 13.5 percent and private equity was
up 14.6 percent, according to the statement.  Pension costs for retired public employees are straining
governments from California to Rhode Island. Calstrs, as the
fund is known, had assets to cover just 69 percent of projected
liabilities in fiscal 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The fund earned 1.8 percent in the fiscal year that ended
June 30, below its 7.5 percent assumed rate of return.  The California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the
largest U.S. pension at $254.1 billion, also earned about 13
percent on invested assets last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
