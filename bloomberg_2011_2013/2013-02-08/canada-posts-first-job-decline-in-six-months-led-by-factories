Canadian  employment  fell for the
first time in six months in January on declines in manufacturing
and education.  Employment fell by 21,900 following December’s gain of
31,200, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. The  unemployment
rate  fell to 7 percent from 7.1 percent, the lowest since
December 2008’s 6.8 percent, as fewer people looked for work.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a 5,000 job gain
and 7.2 percent unemployment, according to the median of 23
forecasts.  The jobs decline mirrors other recent signs of weaknesses
in the world’s 11th largest economy, such as falling exports and
inflation rates, leading policy makers to reduce economic growth
forecasts. Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  has said the
country will need to rely more on business investment and
exports for growth as the housing market slows.  “It’s going to be a dicey period throughout the first part
of this year,”  David Watt , chief economist at HSBC Bank Canada,
said from Toronto, who forecast a 15,000 job decline. “I was
more surprised by the resilience of the labor market and
anticipated, as we turned to this year, the employment numbers
were going to catch up with the rest of the economy.”  The Canadian dollar depreciated 0.4 percent to C$1.0015 per
U.S. dollar at 9:58 a.m. in Toronto, weakening through parity.  Full-time employment fell by 20,600 in January and part-
time positions by 1,400, Statistics Canada said.  Labor Force  The labor force shrank by 57,500 in January, the largest
drop since April 1995, and the participation rate fell to 66.6
percent from 66.8 percent.  The biggest job losses by industry were a 30,900 drop in
education and 21,600 in manufacturing. The losses were partly
offset by gains of 17,100 new jobs in construction and 17,200 in
professional, scientific and technical services.  Canada Bread Co., which is 90 percent owned by Maple Leaf
Foods Inc., said Jan. 30 it will fire about 120 workers when
closing bakeries in New Brunswick and Alberta this year.  Private companies cut 18,800 workers and public-sector
employment dropped by 27,000 in January. The federal government
has been reducing its workforce as part of efforts to eliminate
its budget deficit.  Workers designated by Statistics Canada as employees fell
by 45,800 while the self-employed increased by 23,900 in
January.  Economic Payback  “We view this weakness as payback following a period of
surprising strength and not the beginning of a new trend,” said
 David Tulk , chief Canada macro strategist at Toronto-Dominion
Bank’s TD Securities unit. “With economic growth expected to
remain soft through the first half of 2013, we see a modest pace
of employment.”  Average hourly  wages  of permanent employees rose 2 percent
in January from a year earlier, slower than the prior reading of
2.5 percent.  The province of Saskatchewan took over the country’s lowest
jobless rate in January, falling to 4 percent from 4.6 percent.
Alberta’s rate remained at 4.5 percent in January. Ontario’s
jobless rate fell to 7.7 percent from 7.9 percent, while
Quebec’s dropped to 7.1 percent from 7.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
