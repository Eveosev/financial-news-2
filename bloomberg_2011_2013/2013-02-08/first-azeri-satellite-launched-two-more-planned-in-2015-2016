Azerbaijan launched its first
communications satellite as the oil-rich former Soviet republic
seeks to develop information technology to diversify its economy
beyond energy.  The third largest oil-producer in the former Soviet Union
plans to launch two more communications satellite in 2015 and
2016, President Ilham Aliyev said today in an address to the
nation, according to state news agency  Azartac .  The Azerspace/Africasat-1a satellite was carried into orbit
by a Arianespace Inc. spacecraft at 6:36 p.m. in Cayenne, French
Guiana, yesterday, the company said on its  website .  The Azerspace/Africasat-1a will provide communications
services to Azerbaijan, Central Asia, Europe and Africa, said
 Orbital Sciences Corp ., the Dulles, Virginia-based company that
designed and built the satellite. Orbital will be responsible
for providing the satellite and ground systems, it said.  Aliyev has ordered his government to double the non-oil
sectors of the economy in the next decade as crude production
declined for a second year in 2012.  The Caspian Sea nationâ€™s Communications and Information
Technology Ministry ordered its first satellite in June 2010,
under a contract worth $205 million, according to the Azeri
embassy in Washington. It will transmit from an orbital location
at 46 degrees east longitude, Orbital said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
