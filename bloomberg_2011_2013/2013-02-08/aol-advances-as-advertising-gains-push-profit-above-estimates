AOL Inc. , the Web publisher that owns
the Huffington Post and TechCrunch, climbed the most in three
months in New York trading after posting its first sales gain in
eight years.  Fourth-quarter sales rose 3.9 percent from a year earlier
to $599.5 million. Analysts had estimated that revenue would
drop to $566.7 million in the period. The surprise growth came
largely from AOL’s third-party ad sales business, which helps
other Web publishers sell ad space through automated systems --a
process called programmatic buying.  “The future of advertising is going to be more machine-to-
machine trading,” Chief Executive Officer  Tim Armstrong  said in
an interview, referring to the rise in trading desks that are
used to buy and sell digital ad inventory, similar to the way
stock markets work. “There will also be growth in the human
side of buying as well.”  The shares advanced 7.4 percent to $33.72 at the close in
New York, the biggest one-day increase since November. AOL’s
stock has surged 86 percent in the past 12 months, better than
the 12 percent return from the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The uptick in revenue marks a turning point for Armstrong,
who has worked to transform the New York-based company into an
advertising-based content publisher rather than a dial-up
Internet service provider. AOL, which was spun off from Time
Warner Inc. in 2009, said total advertising rose 13 percent to
$410.6 million in the quarter.  Earnings Estimates  Net income rose to $35.7 million, or 41 cents a share, from
$22.8 million, or 23 cents, a year earlier. Excluding some
items, profit was 55 cents a share. That topped the 53 cents
analysts predicted, according to data  compiled by Bloomberg .  The company also authorized $100 million in stock
repurchases over the next 12 months. It spent almost $700
million on buybacks in 2012, reducing its shares outstanding by
19 percent.  By reducing the number of shares outstanding, the
repurchases ended up boosting Armstrong’s stake in AOL. In a
filing today, he said he now owns 6 percent of the company,
based on shares he acquired in 2010 and 2011.  Search advertising increased 17 percent in the fourth
quarter to $103.6 million, according to the company. Display
advertising -- a category that includes banners and video -- was
little changed at $169.8 million.  Armstrong has spent more than $600 million on Web
publishing, acquiring the Huffington Post in 2011 for $315
million and investing more than $300 million to develop Patch, a
local-news division that he said should start becoming
profitable by the end of this year.  Patch generated less than $40 million last year, missing
its sales target by about 25 percent, according to Armstrong.
Hurricane Sandy affected ad sales in several hundred Patch
towns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
