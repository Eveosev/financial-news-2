Primerica Inc. , the life insurer
previously owned by Citigroup Inc., advanced in New York trading
as fourth-quarter profit climbed on a boost in policy sales.  Primerica rose 3.3 percent to $33.63 at 4:06 p.m. The
Duluth, Georgia-based company has climbed 35 percent in the past
12 months.  Net income  grew 8.2 percent to $40.3 million as net
premiums increased 14 percent, Primerica said yesterday in a
statement after the close of trading. Operating profit was 69
cents a share, missing by 1 cent the average estimate of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Our results were marked by solid performance across
segments,” Co-Chief Executive Officer  Rick Williams  said in the
statement. That includes a 16 percent increase in the term-life
net premium revenue in the period, Primerica said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
