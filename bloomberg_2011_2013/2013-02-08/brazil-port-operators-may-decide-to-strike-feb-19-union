A worker strike could paralyze
Brazilian ports beginning Feb. 20, according to the National
Federation of Ports website.
*A national strike could be decided in meetings scheduled for
Feb. 19-21 in Brasilia
*Unions want changes to Provisional Measure 595, from Dec. 6,
which alters the concession guidelines for private companies to
develop ports
*The National Federation of Ports says that some unions have
declared “a state of strike”  *NOTE: The ports federation reports that its president, Eduardo
Guterra, says Provisional Measure 595 “weakens public ports”
and “endangers work” because private terminals don’t hire
individual workers that are registered with the proper port
authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
