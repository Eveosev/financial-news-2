Average base salaries in the oil and
gas business rose 8.5 percent globally last year to $87,300,
according to a report by Hays Oil & Gas and Oil and Gas Job
Search.  The increase in pay was led partly by growth in hiring for
non-conventional field developments, such as shale gas, the
companies said in an e-mailed statement.  “This was seen by many nations as the route to energy
independence and saw a wave of hirings,” Hays Oil & Gas
Managing Director Matt Underhill said in the  report , which was
based on more than 25,000 respondents.  Australia topped the list with average salaries for local
employees and foreigners at $163,600 and $171,000, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
