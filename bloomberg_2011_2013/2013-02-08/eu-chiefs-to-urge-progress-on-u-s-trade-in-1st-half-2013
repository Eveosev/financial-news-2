European Union leaders want progress
toward a trade deal with the U.S. in the first six months of
this year, an EU official said, citing draft conclusions of a
two-day summit in Brussels.  The EU and U.S. will soon receive recommendations on how to
advance the trade accord from a working-group report. Ireland,
which holds the EUâ€™s six-month rotating presidency, will then
lead talks toward formal negotiations.  The leaders will seek immediate follow-up to the report to
advance toward a comprehensive agreement, according to the draft
post-summit statement.  EU leaders also will say they expect negotiations on a
free-trade deal with Canada to wrap up shortly, according to the
draft conclusions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
