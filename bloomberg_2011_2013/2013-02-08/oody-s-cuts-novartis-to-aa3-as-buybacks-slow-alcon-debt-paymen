Novartis AG ’s long-term credit rating
was cut one grade by Moody’s Investors Service to Aa3 because
the company is slow to pay down debt from its 2010 acquisition
of a majority stake in Alcon Inc.  The firm raised the drugmaker’s outlook to stable from
negative and left the Prime-1 short-term ratings unchanged,
Moody’s said in statement today.  By the end of 2012, Novartis had not  paid  down enough of
its debt to merit an Aa2 rating, mainly because the company
spent about $5 billion to buy back shares, Moody’s said.
Novartis probably won’t be able to raise its rating in 2013
because it faces patent expiries, costs linked to manufacturing
setbacks at its Lincoln, Nebraska, site and unusually high
investments in plants and equipment.  “Moody’s views Novartis as being solidly positioned at
Aa3, leaving the company with leeway to make bolt-on
acquisitions,” Moody’s said in the statement. “The stable
outlook reflects Moody’s expectation that, despite some decline
in profits and cash flows in 2013, these will resume growth in
2014.”  A Novartis spokesman didn’t immediately reply to a request
for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
