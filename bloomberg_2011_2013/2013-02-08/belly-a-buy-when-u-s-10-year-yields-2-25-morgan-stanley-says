Treasuries investors should purchase
five- to 10-year notes if the yield on the benchmark security
rises to 2.25 percent in the first quarter, according to Morgan
Stanley.  “If yields rise in line with near-term risks in the first
quarter of 2013, we intend to change from a defensive stance to
a positive stance on the Treasury market,”  Matt Hornbach , head
of U.S. interest-rate strategy, said in an interview yesterday
at Morgan Stanley’s headquarters in New York. “We view this as
an opportunity to adopt an overweight stance toward duration
with a focus on the intermediate part of the curve.”  Intermediate, or belly, refers to the five- to 10-year
maturities on the so-called yield curve, he said.  “The five- to 10-year part offers the most attractive roll
down and carry, so we’d prefer those maturities once 10-year
yields continue to move higher toward 2.25 percent,” Hornbach
said.  Carry is the difference between funding costs and lending
rates, while roll-down represents the appreciation from holding
a security when the curve is steep.  The yield on the  10-year note  touched a 10-month high of
2.058 percent on Feb. 4, dropping today to 1.96 percent,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. Economists in a
Bloomberg News survey forecast that the yield will rise to 2.23
percent by the end of the year, in line with Morgan Stanley’s
2013 2.25 percent forecast.  Risk events that may lead to higher yields include the
Federal Reserve minutes scheduled for release on Feb. 20 and the
announcement in Europe of an emergency three-year loan
repayment, part of the longer-term refinancing operations
program, on Feb. 22, Hornbach said. Other risks include economic
data outperforming expectations until mid-March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
