China’s consumer prices rose 2
percent in January from a year earlier while the producer-price
index dropped 1.6 percent, the National Bureau of Statistics
said today in Beijing.  Inflation compares with the 2 percent median estimate of 35
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News and a 2.5 percent pace in
December. Analysts forecast a 1.6 percent decline in producer
prices after a 1.9 percent drop the previous month.  The pace of price gains in each of the first two months of
the year is distorted by the timing of the Lunar New Year
holiday, which falls in February this year and was in January
last year. Hao Hong, managing director for research at the
securities unit of Bank of Communications Co., said this week
that “the last thing you want to do is compare this January with
last January” in China’s data.  China’s central bank signaled concern that inflation risks
will increase and that the government must be alert to changes
in price-gain expectations and increases in import costs.  “An economic recovery and demand expansion may pass into
CPI in a relatively fast manner,” the People’s Bank of China
said in a quarterly monetary policy report released Feb. 6.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
