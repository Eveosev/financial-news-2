Hungary’s 10-year yields approached
the highest level in two months as the trade surplus shrank to
the smallest in 2 1/2 years, adding to signs the country is
struggling to emerge from recession.  The yields rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 6.525 percent, within one basis point of the highest
since Dec. 10. The forint gained 0.1 percent to 292.55 per euro
by 11:27 a.m. in Budapest, declining less than 0.1 percent this
week.  The  surplus  narrowed to 192.3 million euros ($256 million),
the lowest since July 2010, according to data from the central
statistics office. That compared with the 350 million euros
median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Industrial
production fell the most in the fourth quarter of 2012 since the
peak of the financial crisis in early 2009 as vehicle output
reversed expansion, the statistics office said yesterday.  “Both exports and imports ran out of steam”  Zsolt Kondrat , a Budapest-based analyst at Bayerische Landesbank’s MKB
unit, wrote in an e-mailed report today. “This is not such a
big surprise after yesterday’s industrial figures showed a near
collapse in December and it is a reflection of the deteriorating
external economic environment in the fourth quarter.”  The weaker-than-expected trade figures may push the forint
toward weakening,  Zoltan Arokszallasi , an analyst at Erste Group
Bank AG, wrote in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
