Canada’s  merchandise trade  deficit
narrowed in December as imports fell faster than exports, adding
to the year’s record shortfall, government figures showed.  The deficit of C$901 million ($903 million) reported by
Statistics Canada from Ottawa today was smaller than the C$1.45
billion predicted in a Bloomberg economist survey. Today’s
report also lowered November’s estimated deficit to C$1.67
billion from C$1.96 billion.  Canada has recorded nine consecutive trade deficits, and
the central bank has said the export recovery is the slowest
since World War II, hobbled by a strong currency and
inconsistent global demand. Governor Mark Carney said last month
the case for raising his policy interest rate from 1 percent was
“less imminent” as he cut his 2013 growth forecast.  Exports  fell by 0.9 percent to C$37.6 billion in December,
led by energy and automobiles.  Imports  fell 2.8 percent to
C$38.5 billion.  The annual trade deficit was a record C$12.0 billion based
on preliminary Statistics Canada figures, exceeding the previous
record of C$10.8 billion in 2010.  The  surplus with the U.S.  narrowed to C$3.53 billion in
December from C$3.84 billion a month earlier. The deficit with
countries other than the U.S. narrowed to C$4.43 billion from
C$5.51 billion.  The volume of exports declined 2.1 percent and import
volumes fell 2.7 percent, Statistics Canada said. Volume figures
adjust for price changes and can be a better indicator of how
trade contributes to economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
