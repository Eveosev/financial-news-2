Chile’s  consumer prices  rose 0.2
percent in January, exceeding estimates made by analysts as
transport and utility costs gained, the National Statistics
Institute said.  The median estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for prices to increase 0.1 percent from the previous month.
Annual inflation accelerated to 1.6 percent from 1.5 percent in
December, the statistics agency said in a report today. Core
consumer prices, which exclude fuel and produce, increased 0.1
percent in January from December.  Chile ended last year with the lowest inflation rate among
major Latin American countries and the fastest economic growth
behind Peru, according to analysts polled by Bloomberg. Economic
gains eventually will put pressure on consumer prices, forcing
the central bank board to act,  Alfredo Coutino , Latin America
director at Moody’s Analytics, wrote Feb. 6.  “If fiscal and monetary policymakers do not respond soon,
inflation could start to rise before the middle of 2013,”
Coutino wrote in a note e-mailed to investors.  Two-year breakeven inflation, which is derived from the
difference between nominal and inflation-linked yields on swaps,
increased 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, to 2.83
percent yesterday from the end of last year. Policy makers
target 3 percent inflation, plus or minus one percentage point
over 24 months.  The world’s top copper producer will grow 4.5 percent in
2013 after expanding an estimated 5.45 percent in 2012,
according to the median estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The economists estimate the key interest rate will
increase to 5.25 percent by the end of 2013 from today’s 5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
