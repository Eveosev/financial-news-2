Moody’s Corp. , owner of the second-
largest credit ratings firm, said fourth-quarter profit
increased 66 percent as companies took advantage of record
investor demand and lower borrowing costs by issuing debt.  Net income climbed to $160.1 million from $96.2 million a
year earlier, the New York-based  company  said today in a
statement distributed by Business Wire.  Profit  excluding certain
items was 73 cents per share, exceeding the average estimate of
71 cents in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  Companies from the U.S. to Europe to Asia tapped debt
markets at the fastest pace ever in the fourth quarter with
worldwide corporate issuance at $998 billion, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Federal Reserve has held its target
rate for overnight loans among banks between zero and 0.25
percent since December 2008 to spur economic growth after the
longest recession since the 1930s.  Moody’s fell 7.7 percent to $43.37 in New York, the lowest
level since Sept. 11. After trading at a five-year high, its
shares fell as much as 11.7 percent Feb. 4 as the Justice
Department filed a lawsuit against its competitor, Standard &
Poor’s, a unit of McGraw-Hill Cos.  The suit claims the world’s largest credit rater
deliberately understated the risk of bonds by mortgages made to
the least creditworthy borrowers to win business from Wall
Street banks.  “We don’t have any knowledge of any pending complaint by
the Department of Justice raising similar claims against
Moody’s,” Chief Executive Officer  Ray McDaniel  said today on an
earnings call with analysts.  Moody’s said revenue rose 33 percent to $754.2 million for
the quarter, from  $567.1  million in the year-earlier period.
Ratings from Moody’s Investors Service account for about 70
percent of the firm’s sales in 2011, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
