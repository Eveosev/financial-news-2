Swiss stocks  climbed, rebounding from
their biggest tumble in 12 weeks yesterday, as Chinese trade
data beat forecasts and European Union leaders proposed the
first-ever cuts to the bloc’s budget.  Swiss Life Holding AG rallied the most in a month as
JPMorgan Chase & Co. recommended buying shares in Switzerland’s
largest life insurer. EMS-Chemie Holding AG rose to its highest
price since at least 1989 after saying it will pay an
extraordinary dividend of 2.50 Swiss francs a share. Emmi AG
dropped 1.8 percent.  The  SMI  gained 0.5 percent to 7,372.85 at 10:52 a.m. in
Zurich. The gauge has still slipped 0.6 percent so far this
week, trimming its advance in 2013 to 8.1 percent, amid signs of
political uncertainty in Spain and Italy. The broader Swiss
Performance Index also increased 0.5 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 21 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  In China, a report showed that exports and imports rose
more than estimated in a January that had five working days more
than last year.  Exports  increased 25 percent from a year
earlier, the customs administration said, compared with the
median economist projection of 17.5 percent. Imports climbed
28.8 percent, exceeding the 23.5 percent  estimate  in a Bloomberg
News survey.  EU Budget  In Brussels, the leaders of the EU’s 27 members states
convened at 6:30 a.m. today to consider a spending ceiling of
960 billion euros ($1.3 trillion) for 2014-2020, down from an
original proposal of 1.047 trillion euros and less than the 994
billion euros spent in the current budget cycle.  Switzerland’s unemployment rate remained at the highest
level in almost two years in January. The  jobless rate , adjusted
for seasonal swings, stayed at 3.1 percent, the State
Secretariat for Economic Affairs said today. That matched the
 median estimate  of 11 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Swiss Life advanced 2.7 percent to 138.60 francs.  Michael Huttner , an analyst at JPMorgan, raised the stock to overweight,
the equivalent of buy, from neutral, citing faster earnings
growth and an attractive valuation.  EMS-Chemie  gained 2.2 percent to 239.90 francs after saying
it will pay a total dividend of 10 francs a share. The company
reported 2012 earnings before interest and taxes of 319 million
francs ($348 million), beating the average analyst projection of
315.4 million francs.  “EMS-Chemie again proved its defensive qualities: reliable
dividend, robust margins, rock solid balance sheet and top-line
growth even in adverse market conditions,”  Patrick Rafaisz , an
analyst at Vontobel Holding AG, wrote in a note to clients.  Emmi  lost 4.50 francs to 250.50 francs after UBS AG
downgraded the dairy producer to neutral from buy, meaning
investors should sell the shares. UBS cited the stocks’ recent
strong rally. Emmi has jumped 8.9 percent so far this year,
while the SMI has gained 8.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
