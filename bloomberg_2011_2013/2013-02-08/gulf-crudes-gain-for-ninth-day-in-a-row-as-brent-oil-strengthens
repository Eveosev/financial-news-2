Oils produced in the Gulf of Mexico
strengthened for a ninth day as Brent crude surged to a nine-
month high in London.  Light Louisiana Sweet oil advanced $1.35 to a $22.35
premium to U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil at
11:55 a.m. in New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It was the longest streak of gains for the grade since July.
Heavy Louisiana Sweet increased $1.30 to a premium of $22.45 a
barrel.  Offshore oils strengthened as the  spread  between the price
of WTI and Brent, the global oil benchmark, widened by $1.73 a
barrel to a $23.14 premium for Brent as of 2:27 p.m. A rising
Brent price tends to boost U.S. offshore domestic oils, which
compete with overseas imports.  Brent rose as China’s  crude imports  increased to the
highest level in eight months, customs figures showed.  Other offshore grades also strengthened.  Mars Blend , a sour
offshore grade, added $1.60 to $16.35 over WTI.  Thunder Horse , a
sour crude with lower sulfur content than Mars, gained $1.70 to
a $20.20 premium. Southern Green Canyon’s premium gained by 90
cents to $15.30.  Canadian heavy oil strengthened for a fifth day as export
pipelines carrying the grade were less congested in February
than prior months.  Western Canada Select , a heavy bitumen blend,
gained 75 cents to a $24.25 discount against West Texas
Intermediate, according to Calgary oil broker Net Energy Inc.  Canadian Pipelines  Apportionment on Canada’s largest oil export pipelines to
the U.S., a measure of demand for space on the lines, declined
for a third month in February. Extra production from the Kearl
oil sands project in Alberta was delayed to the end of the first
quarter, also freeing up space.  Enbridge Inc. ’s Lines 4 and 67, transporting heavy oil from
Alberta to the U.S., were apportioned by 7 percent this month,
the lowest amount since September and down from 18 percent in
November, the company said in a Jan. 29 notice to shippers.
Apportionment is the amount of extra oil shippers ask to ship
beyond a pipeline’s capacity. The level of apportionment can
reflect oversupply in the market.  Lines 4 and 67 combined can transport as much as 1.25
million barrels a day to the U.S. from Canada, according to
Enbridge’s  website .  Exxon Mobil Corp.  said Feb. 1 that the 110,000-barrel-a-day
Kearl oil sands project won’t begin production until the end of
the first quarter and won’t reach full rates until the end of
the year. The extra-heavy oil supply was expected to start in
January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
