  German stocks  were little changed,
with the DAX Index on course for the biggest weekly drop since
June, as a report showed the country’s exports rose to a record
in 2012 and European Union leaders prepared to negotiate cuts to
the bloc’s budget.  MorphoSys AG gained 1.1 percent after winning a U.S. patent
for its antibody platform Ylanthia. Exporters Daimler AG and
Adidas AG increased at least 0.5 percent.  The  DAX Index  slipped 0.1 percent to 7,583.21 at 11:04 a.m.
in Frankfurt. The gauge has dropped 3.2 percent this week as
Spanish and Italian bond yields climbed amid political
uncertainty arising from corruption allegations against Premier
Mariano Rajoy and impending Italian elections this month. The
HDAX broader Index slipped less than 0.1 percent today.  German  exports , adjusted for working days and seasonal
changes, increased 0.3 percent in December from a month earlier,
when they fell a revised 2.2 percent, the Federal Statistics
Office in Wiesbaden said today. Exports rose 3.4 percent in 2012
to a record 1.1 trillion euros ($1.47 trillion), the office
said.  European leaders reassembled at 6:30 a.m. today to
negotiate the 27-nation bloc’s budget for 2014-2020 at the
second day of a summit in Brussels. Leaders may decide on the
first-ever cuts in the bloc’s budget, as they consider a pending
ceiling of 960 billion euros, down from an original proposal of
1.047 trillion euros and less than the 994 billion euros spent
in the current budget cycle.  China Economy  In China, exports and imports rose more than estimated in a
January that had five working days more than last year, the
customs administration said. Overseas shipments increased 25
percent from a year earlier, the report showed, compared with
economists’ projection of 17.5 percent. Imports climbed 28.8
percent, exceeding a 23.5 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey.  MorphoSys added 37.5 cents to 34.17 euros. The company uses
its Ylanthia platform to identify antibodies that may make
effective treatments. Antibody drugs, used to treat diseases
such as cancer or arthritis, are based on substances found in
human immune systems.  Daimler, the world’s third-largest maker of luxury
vehicles, gained 0.5 percent to 44.42 euros.  Adidas , the world’s
second-biggest sporting-goods maker, added 1.4 percent to 68.08
euros.  Software AG, the infrastructure software provider, gained
2.7 percent to 29.23 euros after saying it will spend up to 180
million euros on a share buyback.  RWE AG dropped 1.5 percent to 26.49 euros. HSBC Holdings
Plc downgraded the utility to underweight, the equivalent of a
sell recommendation, from neutral, citing a possible 10 percent
 dividend  cut in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
