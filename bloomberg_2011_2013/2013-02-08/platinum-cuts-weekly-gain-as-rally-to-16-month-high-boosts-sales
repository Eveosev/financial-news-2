Platinum declined, trimming a weekly
advance, on speculation that a climb to the highest price in
more than 16 months will prompt some investors to sell. Gold was
little changed.  Platinum for immediate delivery dropped as much as 0.7
percent to $1,706.75 an ounce and was at $1,710.80 at 3:02 p.m.
in Singapore, up 1.6 percent this week. Prices reached the
highest since September 2011 yesterday before dropping 1 percent.
Spot gold was at $1,672.30 an ounce from $1,671.65 yesterday, up
0.3 percent this week.  Platinum has climbed 12 percent this year on concern supply
may drop in South Africa, the largest producer, and as investors
boosted holdings in exchange-traded products backed by the metal
to a record 51.461 metric tons yesterday, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Platinum’s 14-day relative strength index on Feb.
6 had risen above 70, a level that indicates to some analysts
who study such charts that a drop in prices may be imminent. The
reading was at 62.5 today.  “Palladium and platinum are down a little bit having risen
strongly in the last two months,” said  Nick Trevethan , an
analyst at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in
Singapore. “Reduced activity in China and Asia ahead of the
holiday has probably led to a little more selling pressure.”  China’s financial markets will be closed next week to mark
the Lunar New Year holiday.  Gold for April delivery was little changed at $1,672.90 an
ounce on the Comex in New York. Cash bullion of 99.99 percent
 purity  fell 0.2 percent to $336.80 yuan a gram ($1,679.40 an
ounce) on the Shanghai Gold Exchange. Most-active futures were
little changed at 30,814 rupees per 10 grams ($1,788.90 an ounce)
on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd.  Palladium dropped as much as 1.3 percent to $741.75 an
ounce, and was at $746, poised for a weekly loss. Silver was
little changed at $31.515 an ounce, also set for a weekly loss.  To contact the reporter for this story:
