Former JJB Sports Plc Chairman  David Charles Jones  and his son, Stuart Mark Jones, were charged over
misleading statements made by the company to investors in 2009,
prosecutors said.  The men were charged at a criminal court in Leeds, England
today, the Serious Fraud Office said in a statement. David
Charles Jones, 70, who was the executive chairman of the
sporting goods retailer from January 2009 to January 2010, is
accused of making two misleading statements and forgery.  His 38-year-old son, who was the head of marketing at JJB
Sports in February 2009, was accused of helping his father
violate a forgery law. Both men live in West Yorkshire in the
north of England.  JJB Sports, founded in the 1970s by former professional
soccer player David Whelan, collapsed in 2012 after it struggled
to cope with increased competition from supermarkets and rivals
such as  Sports Direct International Plc . The companyâ€™s
administrators, KPMG LLP, said it would close most of its stores
in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
