New York Yankees Managing General
Partner  Hal Steinbrenner  said he is concerned about reports that
third baseman  Alex Rodriguez  used banned drugs as recently as
last season, according to the Associated Press.  The Miami New Times reported last week that Rodriguez, a
14-time All-Star and three-time American League Most Valuable
Player, bought performance-enhancing substances from a clinic in
Coral Gables, Florida. Major League Baseball said it is
investigating the report, which Rodriguez has said is false.  Speaking today at the team’s minor-league complex in Tampa,
Florida, Steinbrenner said the allegations against Rodriguez
were “a concern, but it’s out of our hands,” AP reported.  “We will cooperate with MLB in any way we can, any way
we’re asked to,” Steinbrenner said, according to the AP.  Rodriguez, 37, could miss the entire 2013 season after
having hip surgery last month. There is $114 million left on the
10-year contract he signed with the Yankees after the 2007
season.  ESPN reported last week that Rodriguez received injections
directly from Anthony Bosch, the owner of the Biogenesis of
America clinic.  Rodriguez acknowledged using performance-enhancing drugs
from 2001 to 2003 while playing for the Texas Rangers. He has
denied any connection with Bosch or the Biogenesis clinic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
