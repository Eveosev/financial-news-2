Wholesale electricity prices on Long
Island more than doubled after a subsea transmission line was
shut for more than three hours while a winter storm approached.  Neptune Regional System LLC’s 660-megawatt line, which
brings power to Long Island from New Jersey, was shut at 7:23
a.m., the region’s grid operator said. The conduit was returned
to service at about 11 a.m. after repairs to a leak in the valve
cooling system,  Christopher Hocker , vice president of planning
for Neptune in Fairfield, Connecticut, said in an e-mail.  On-peak power  for Long Island rose $205.93 from yesterday
to average $337.79 a megawatt-hour at 11:13 a.m., heading for
the highest daily real-time average since Jan. 25, according to
New York Independent System Operator Inc. data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The storm may bring as much as 20 inches (51 centimeters)
of snow to eastern Long Island beginning tonight.  National Grid Plc, which operates the electricity network
for the Long Island Power Authority, forecasts that more than
100,000 customers in the area will lose power, according to a
statement on the authority’s website.  Electricity demand  across the New York state grid was
21,809 megawatts at 11:21 a.m., 6.1 percent above a  forecast 
made yesterday, according to the NYISO.  New York City  on-peak prices gained $68.76, or 68 percent,
to $169.99 a megawatt-hour, heading for the highest real-time
average since Jan. 25, according to the grid operator.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
