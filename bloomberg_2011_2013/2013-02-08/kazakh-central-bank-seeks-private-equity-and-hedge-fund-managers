Kazakhstan’s central bank will select
private equity fund-of-fund managers and fund-of-hedge-fund
managers to place as much as $300 million as the Central Asian
nation plans its first alternative investments.  The tender requirements stipulate that potential private-
equity managers must have $5 billion or more in assets and at
least ten years of investment experience, the Almaty-based
central bank said in e-mailed  statements  today. Prospective
hedge-fund managers must have five years of experience as well
as $5 billion or more under management. The approximate size of
both mandates is $50 million to $150 million, and applications
close by the end of this month.  Since establishing the National Oil Fund in 2000,
Kazakhstan has set aside $58 billion of oil profits to preserve
wealth for the country’s future generations and protect the
economy from external shocks. The fund is now seeking to boost
returns in higher-yielding investments by diversifying into new
asset classes.  The central bank said private equity fund-of-funds will be
permitted to invest in mezzanine, primary and secondary private-
equity funds, with their strategies limited to growth capital,
special situations and buyouts. Funds of hedge fund strategies
were limited to global macro, event-driven, credit, long/short
equity, multi-strategy, fixed-income arbitrage and managed
futures.  To contact the reporters on this story:
