U.K.  construction output  rose more
than previously estimated in the fourth quarter, boosted by
building of private homes and infrastructure work.  Output increased 0.9 percent from the previous three
months, the most since the second quarter of 2011, the Office
for National Statistics said today. That compares with an
estimate of 0.3 percent in  gross domestic product  figures
published Jan. 25. The revision would add 0.04 percentage point
to GDP, which fell 0.3 percent in the period, the ONS said.  Construction accounts for about 6.8 percent of the economy
and the ONS said today’s revision will have “no impact at one
decimal place on the preliminary” GDP reading for the fourth
quarter. The next estimate of GDP will be published on Feb. 27.  Building of new private housing rose 5.9 percent in the
fourth quarter from the previous three months, the ONS said. New
infrastructure output increased 4.2 percent.  Today’s report also showed that construction output fell a
non-seasonally adjusted 16.2 percent in December from November.
It was down an unadjusted 15.1 percent from a year earlier.  The ONS released  industrial output data  yesterday in which
it revised its estimate for fourth-quarter production to a
decline of 1.9 percent instead of the 1.8 percent fall estimated
in the GDP figures. It said those figures will subtract 0.01
percentage point from GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
