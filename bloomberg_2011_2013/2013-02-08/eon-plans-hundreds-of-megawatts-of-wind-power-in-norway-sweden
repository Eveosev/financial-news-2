EON SE  plans to build hundreds of
megawatts of wind power in Norway and Sweden, where costs for
developers are lower than other European countries.  Germany’s biggest utility has proposals for nine onshore
farms in Norway totaling 1,500 megawatts as the country’s low
population density and strong winds allow larger and cheaper
projects than in Germany or Poland, EON’s Mark Porter said.  “Norway has a huge untapped potential,” said Porter, the
northern Europe onshore wind power director. “It’s a new market
that has many cost-efficient projects. We plan to complete a
handful before 2020 though not all nine farms will make it.”  Norway has  agreed  with the European Union to raise to 67.5
percent the share of energy demand it gets from renewables by
2020, up 6.4 percentage points from 2010.  Norwea , the country’s
wind power association, sees installed capacity rising to 3,500
megawatts by then, compared with 632 megawatts as of Dec. 20.  EON, the largest developer of  offshore  wind power, is also
planning to site one of the world’s largest sea-based farms in
Sweden’s Soedra Midsjoebanken, exporting power from the proposed
700 megawatt facility to the Baltic region, Poland and Germany.  “Sweden has great offshore potential, competitive with
Germany and the U.K., but first new physical cables are needed
and it’ll likely be the back end of this decade before we can
harness the potential,” Porter said yesterday from Malmoe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
