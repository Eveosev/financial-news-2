Mustek Ltd. , a South African
information technology company, advanced the most in almost 18
months after saying earnings per share probably rose as much as
50 percent for the half year through December.  The stock increased as much as 8.1 percent, the most on an
intraday basis since September 2011, and was 3.6 percent higher
at 5.75 rand by 2:54 p.m. in Johannesburg. About 201,000 shares
changed hands, or 230 percent of the daily average of the last
three months.  “Basic earnings per share is expected to be between 45
percent and 50 percent higher” compared with a year earlier,
the company said in a statement.  Mustek, which builds customized Mecer computers in Africa’s
largest economy, increased sales for the full year through June
by 18.2 percent to 4.1 billion rand ($461 million). The
company’s shares are 8 percent higher since the beginning of the
