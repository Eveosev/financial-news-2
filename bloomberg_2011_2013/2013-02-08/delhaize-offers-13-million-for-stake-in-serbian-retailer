Delhaize Group SA , the owner of the
Food Lion supermarkets, plans to buy a 16 percent stake in
Serbian retailer C Market from the country’s government to raise
its holding to more than 91 percent.  The Belgian retailer will pay 9.72 million euros ($13
million) for the stake, or 300 euros per share, the Serbian
 Privatization Agency  said in an e-mailed statement today. The
remaining stake in C Market belongs to the company’s employees.  Delhaize will have to offer the same price per share to
employees once it decides to take full control of the Serbian
company,  Dusan Belanovic , a spokesman for the Privatization
Agency, said in a phone interview today.  Delhaize started its expansion in the Balkan country in
2011, buying Delta Maxi Group, the country’s biggest grocery
chain, for 932.5 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
