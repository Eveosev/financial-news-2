Georgian President  Mikheil Saakashvili  changed the location for his state-of-the-nation
address to the presidential palace after protesters battled with
security to get the National Library to see the event.  The move was necessary because of the “managed aggressive
and provocative actions from the crowd outside,” presidential
spokeswoman Manana Manjgaladze told reporters. The speech was to
have started at 6 p.m. in Tbilisi, the capital. The address will
now be given at 8 p.m., she said.  The protesters were a mix of government supporters and
former “political prisoners” jailed by the previous
administration led by Saakashvili’s United National Movement
party, the television station Rustavi 2 reported.  Prime Minister  Bidzina Ivanishvili , who scored an upset win
over the president’s party in October elections, approved
legislation freeing 3,000 prisoners and reducing the sentences
for thousands of other inmates starting last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
