India’s government bonds due 2022
completed their first weekly advance in almost a month on
speculation the central bank will cut interest rates to revive
an  economy  forecast to grow at the slowest pace in a decade.  Gross domestic product will increase 5 percent in the
fiscal year ending March 31, compared with 6.2 percent in the
previous 12 months, the Central Statistical Office said
yesterday. That was less than the 5.5 percent median of 34
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. The Reserve Bank of India cut
its benchmark repurchase  rate  on Jan. 29 for the first time
since April.  “The government’s growth prediction has come in below
expectations,” said Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist at
Crisil Ltd. in Mumbai. “We can expect a 25 basis point cut in
rates again next month.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 fell six
basis points this week to 7.84 percent, according to the central
bank’s trading system. The rate fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, today.  RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao reduced the repurchase  rate 
last week to 7.75 percent from 8 percent. The monetary authority
also cut the cash reserve  ratio  to 4 percent from 4.25 percent,
effective tomorrow, injecting 180 billion rupees ($3.4 billion)
into the banking system.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell three basis
points this week to 7.61 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate fell two basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
