Thailand’s government bonds headed
for a second weekly rally after international investors
increased holdings of local debt, lured by its yield advantage
over developed nations. The baht declined.  The 10-year yield fell to the lowest level this year after
global funds bought $1.1 billion more sovereign debt than they
sold this week through yesterday, Thai Bond Market Association
 data  show. Thailand’s policy rate is 2.75 percent, compared with
a maximum of 0.25 percent in the U.S. and 0.1 percent in Japan.
Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said on Jan. 31 there’s
concern the strong baht will hurt tourism and overseas sales,
which account for about two-thirds of its economy.  “The relatively higher yields attract fund inflows,” said
 Tohru Nishihama , an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research
Institute Inc. in Tokyo. “The currency retreated amid concern
that the authorities in countries with high dependence on
exports may take actions to slow gains.”  The yield on the government’s 3.625 percent bonds due June
2023 declined 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, this
week to 3.56 percent as of 8:46 a.m. in Bangkok, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate slipped one basis point
today to the lowest level since Dec. 28.  The baht weakened 0.2 percent today and 0.1 percent this
week to 29.81 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It
touched 29.66 on Jan. 21 and Jan. 31, the strongest level since
August 2011. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in the exchange rate used to price options, dropped eight
basis points today and this week to 5.5 percent.  Finance Minister Kittiratt said this week that he wrote to
the Bank of Thailand, reiterating his view that the Thai
 benchmark rate  is luring capital inflows. The central bank next
meets to review monetary policy on Feb. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
