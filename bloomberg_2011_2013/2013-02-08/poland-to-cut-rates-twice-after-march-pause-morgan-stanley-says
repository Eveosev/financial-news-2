Poland’s rate setters will take a
break in monetary easing before lowering borrowing costs twice
more as economic growth falls short of potential, according to
 Morgan Stanley .  The Narodowy Bank Polski will leave rates at 3.75 percent
at its March 6 meeting after four consecutive reductions and
resume loosening  policy  in the second quarter to take the
benchmark to 3.25 percent,  Pasquale Diana , an economist at
Morgan Stanley in London, wrote in an e-mailed note today.  The bank dropped language from its statement after lowering
rates a quarter point on Feb. 6 that further reductions can’t be
ruled out. While Governor  Marek Belka  said policy makers will
need to “take stock” of the impact of previous cuts at some
point, he also said the bank hasn’t abandoned its easing bias.  “The thinking here seems to be that, after four
consecutive rate cuts, there is a case to be made for a calm
reassessment of the situation,” Diana wrote. “That pause,
however, should not be interpreted as the end of the easing
cycle.”  Risks to Morgan Stanley’s 1.5 percent Polish growth
forecast for this year are “tilted to the downside,” given the
economy in the fourth quarter was “on the brink of outright
contraction,” Diana wrote.  Gross domestic product grew 0.1 percent to 0.2 percent last
quarter from the previous three months, compared with a 0.4
percent increase in the third quarter, he wrote, based on the
full-year growth figure of 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
