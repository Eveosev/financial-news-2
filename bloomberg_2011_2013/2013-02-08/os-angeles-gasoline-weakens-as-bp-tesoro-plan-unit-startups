Spot gasoline in Los Angeles dropped
against futures as  BP Plc  and  Tesoro Corp . were said to be
preparing for the restart of production units at their
refineries in Southern California.  BP’s 266,000-barrel-a-day  Carson  refinery, California’s
second-largest, is scheduled to flare gases tomorrow through
Feb. 16 related to the startup of a fluid catalytic cracker and
alkylation unit following a maintenance turnaround, a person
with knowledge of operations at the plant said yesterday.  Tesoro is also finishing a turnaround at the 97,000-barrel-
a-day  Wilmington  refinery and was expected to begin starting
equipment this week, two people with knowledge of the work said
Feb. 6.  The premium for California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
 Los Angeles  narrowed 1.75 cents to 30 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 1:38 p.m.
East Coast time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Prompt
delivery in Los Angeles rose 3.14 cents to $3.3488 a gallon.  Nymex gasoline futures rose 5.89 cents, or 2 percent, to
settle at $3.0588 a gallon as a storm swept through the U.S.
Northeast.  Carbob in  San Francisco  weakened 0.75 cent to 9.5 cents a
gallon above futures. Prompt delivery there gained 4.14 cents to
$3.1438 a gallon.  Tesoro’s 170,000-barrel-a-day  Golden Eagle  refinery started
a “major unit” on Feb. 4, according to a notice to Contra
Costa County regulators shows.  Tina Barbee , a Tesoro spokeswoman at the company’s
headquarters in San Antonio, said by e-mail today that the
Golden Eagle and Wilmington plants are performing maintenance.  San Francisco Carbob  strengthened  1 cent to a discount of
20.5 cents a gallon against the fuel in Los Angeles. The gap
reached a record 32.5 cents a gallon on Jan. 14.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in  Los Angeles  was
unchanged at an 11-cent-a-gallon premium to Nymex heating oil
futures. The same fuel in  San Francisco  held at a premium of
11.5 cents a gallon.  In  Portland , low-sulfur diesel was also unchanged at 5
cents a gallon above heating oil futures.  Conventional , 84-
octane gasoline remained at a premium of 3 cents a gallon to
gasoline futures.  Portland 84-octane gasoline  strengthened  1.75 cents to 27
cents a gallon under Los Angeles Carbob. The spread reached a
record 75.5 cents a gallon on Oct. 4.  The  3-2-1 refinery crack spread  between Alaskan North Slope
crude, Carbob in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles,
narrowed $1.96 to $26.93 a barrel at 2:22 p.m. New York time.
The crack, a measure of refining profitability, has more than
doubled since the beginning of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
