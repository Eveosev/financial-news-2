South African white-corn futures fell
the lowest in more than 10 months as prices for the grain in the
U.S. dropped and on speculation Africa’s biggest producer of the
grain will grow a surplus crop this season.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
declined 1.2 percent to 1,860 rand ($209) a metric ton by the
close on the South African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg.
That’s the lowest for a most active contract since March 30. The
yellow variety for delivery in the same month decreased 1
percent to 1,911 rand a ton.  Corn futures for March delivery retreated for a sixth day
on the Chicago Board of Trade. South African farmers probably
planted 2.78 million hectares (6.9 million acres) of corn, or 3
percent more than the previous season, the Crop Estimates
Committee said Jan. 24.  “The U.S. corn prices have decreased a lot,”  Brink van Wyk , a trader at BVG Pty Ltd., said by phone from Pretoria. “It
really looks like we are producing a surplus and that means
prices will go down.”  Yellow corn is mainly used as animal feed in South Africa
while the white variety is a staple food.  Wheat for delivery in March gained 0.5  percent to 3,533
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
