TDC A/S shares tumbled the most in 10
weeks in Copenhagen after private-equity owners sold a 15
percent stake in the Danish phone company earlier than a three-
month lock-up period that was agreed upon last year.  The shares dropped 2.3 percent to 40 kroner at 2:23 p.m.
local time after the placing of the stock worth about $850
million. NTC Holding sold 120 million TDC shares, according to a
statement. UBS AG, the sole bookrunner, sold the stock at 39.50
kroner apiece after originally offering 80 million shares,
according to a person close to the deal who asked not to be
identified.  “The fact that they increased the size of the offering
likely reflects good demand,” said  Ole Petter Kjerkreit , an
analyst at ABG Sundal Collier in Oslo who recommends buying the
shares. “That is understandable as we think it is a good
investment at these levels. We expect them to exit the company
at some point but this is probably the selling round for now.”  The shares had climbed 9.7 percent through yesterday since
NTC on Nov. 27 sold 80 million shares at 37.10 kroner apiece in
a deal managed by  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  At the time, the sellers
pledged not to dispose of any further shares for 90 days.  Stephen Malthouse, a spokesman for NTC in London declined
to comment on today’s deal. Povl Damstedt Rasmussen, a spokesman
for TDC in Denmark, said it is the company’s policy to not
comment on shareholder transactions.  TDC’s private-equity owners have been paring their holdings
in Denmark’s largest telephone company since December 2010 when
they cut their stake to less than 60 percent from about 88
percent by selling shares to the public. In February 2012, they
sold about 15 percent of the company, leaving then bookrunner
Morgan Stanley with almost half the stock.  Apax Partners LLP, Blackstone Group LP, KKR & Co., Permira
Advisers LLP and Providence Equity Partners Inc. created holding
company NTC, which agreed to acquire TDC in 2005 for $15.3
billion, Europe’s largest leveraged buyout at the time.  NTC and its subsidiaries now own about 18 percent of TDC’s
equity and voting rights -- excluding treasury shares --
following payment and settlement of the transaction which is
expected to take place on Feb. 13, according to the company
statement. The sellers pledged a new 90-day lock-up as part of
today’s deal, according to terms obtained by Bloomberg.  TDC on Feb. 5 reported fourth-quarter net income of 617
million kroner ($111 million), below analysts’ estimate of 625
million kroner. The company’s sales projection for 2013 also
missed forecasts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
