Mol Nyrt.  dropped the most in more
than 15 months amid soaring volume as  Dana Gas PJSC  sold a part
of its stake in Hungary’s largest refiner.  Mol fell 5 percent to 17,600 forint at the close in
Budapest, the most since Nov. 2, 2011. Traders bought and sold
more than 710,000 shares on the bourse, eight times the stock’s
three-month average. The benchmark BUX stock index, in which Mol
has the second-biggest  weighting  at 32 percent, declined 0.4
percent.  Dana sold 1.675 million shares at 17,575 forint apiece in
an accelerated bookbuilding, according to the terms obtained by
Bloomberg News. Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. were
joint bookrunners. Dana agreed on a three-month lock-up to hold
its remaining stake of 1.486 million Mol shares.  “The news is clearly negative,”  Peter Csaszar , a Warsaw-
based analyst at KBC Groep NV, wrote in an e-mailed report
today. The shares may drop as much as the discount offered by
Dana, Csaszar said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
