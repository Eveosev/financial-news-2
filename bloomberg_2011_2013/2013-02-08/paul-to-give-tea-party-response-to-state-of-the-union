Kentucky Senator  Rand Paul , often
mentioned as a potential Republican presidential candidate in
2016, will deliver the Tea Party response to President  Barack Obama ’s Feb. 12 State of the Union address.  Paul’s speech will be broadcast from the National Press
Club in Washington, timed to follow the official Republican
response from Senator  Marco Rubio  of Florida, the Tea Party
Express group said in a statement.  “Since the president has been re-elected, the debt has
continued to skyrocket and unemployment has ticked up, but he
has offered no solutions and has shown no leadership,”  Amy Kremer , chairwoman of Tea Party Express, said in  a statement .
“In contrast, Senator Rand Paul has put forth solutions that
would spur economic growth and rein in Washington’s out-of-
control spending.”  Paul, son of former Texas congressman and three-time
presidential candidate  Ron Paul , will be the third person to
offer a response from the anti-tax Tea Party to the State of the
Union address by Obama to a joint session of Congress.
Representative  Michele Bachmann , a Minnesota Republican,
delivered the response in 2011, shortly before announcing her
bid for her party’s 2012 presidential nomination. Businessman
 Herman Cain , who also sought the Republican nomination, gave the
speech last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
