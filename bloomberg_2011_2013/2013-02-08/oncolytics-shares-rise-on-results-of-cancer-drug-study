Oncolytics Biotech Inc. , a company
using viruses to develop cancer drugs, climbed to its highest
value in 11 months after results of a study showed that its
Reolysin treatment shrunk lung tumors.  Oncolytics rose 23 percent to C$4.39 in Toronto, its
highest price since March 8. The stock has risen 10 percent this
year.  Data from the Phase 2 trial using Reolysin in combination
with carboplatin and paclitaxel, a chemotherapy, found 95
percent of users studied showed overall tumor shrinkage, with
the average tumor shrinking 34 percent, Oncolytics said in a
statement today. The trial involved patients with squamous cell
carcinoma lung cancer.  “It’s exciting to have 95 percent of patients in this
study exhibit tumor shrinkage and these results further suggest
that Reolysin may have potential use in pre-surgical settings,”
said  Brad Thompson , chief executive officer of Oncolytics, in
the statement.  To date, Oncolytics has observed nine partial and stable
responses and three progressions for a disease control rate of
86 percent.  “Tumor response data shared on Friday are quite
encouraging,” said  Douglas Loe , a health-care analyst with
Byron Capital Markets, in a note to clients. Loe maintained a
speculative buy  rating  and C$8 target price for Oncolytics.  The company jumped 28 percent on Dec. 13 after announcing
positive initial results for a Phase 3 Reolysin trial in head
and neck cancers. In that trial 86 percent of patients exhibited
either tumor stabilization or shrinkage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
