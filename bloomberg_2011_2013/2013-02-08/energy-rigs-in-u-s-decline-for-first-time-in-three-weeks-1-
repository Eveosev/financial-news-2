Oil and gas rigs in the U.S. dropped
for the first time in three weeks,  Baker Hughes Inc . data show.  Total  energy rigs declined by five to 1,759, according to
data posted on  Baker Hughes ’ website. The  gas count  fell by
three to 425, the field-services company based in Houston said.
 Oil rigs  dropped by two to 1,330.  The U.S. energy rig count has fallen for eight straight
months as producers get more gas and oil from wells using a
combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or
fracking. U.S. oil output reached a 20-year high last month, and
gas stockpiles grew to a record in November.  “The question regarding oil drilling is: When is too much
enough? How steep of a growth rate do you really want?”  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New
York, said by telephone. “In natural gas drilling, I think the
real intermediate-term story here is that the amount of drilling
has basically stabilized around this 425- to 430-rig level.”  U.S. oil output  climbed  4,000 barrels a day to 7 million
last week, according to the Energy Information Administration, a
division of the Energy Department. Production rose to the
highest level since January 1993 on Jan. 11.  Stockpiles  of the
feedstock rose 0.7 percent to 371.7 million barrels last week
and reached a 22-year high of 387.3 million in June.  Crude Falls  Crude for March delivery fell 11 cents to settle at $95.72
a barrel today on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down 3
percent from a year ago.  Gas stockpiles  fell 118 billion cubic feet in the week
ended Feb. 1 to 2.684 trillion, according to data compiled by
the EIA. They reached a record high of 3.929 trillion cubic feet
on Nov. 2.  Natural gas for March delivery dropped 1.3 cents to settle
at $3.272 per million British thermal units on the Nymex, up 34
percent from a year ago.  New Mexico lost the most rigs this week, dropping three to
76. Louisiana gained the most, increasing five to 111.  Rigs on land  fell by seven to 1,688.  Rigs in inland  waters
were unchanged at 16.  Vertical rigs  tumbled by 14 to 431, the lowest since
January 2010.  Horizontal  rigs climbed by seven to 1,143, the
highest level since September.  Initial Production  “If you look at the total picture, horizontal rigs are
still net up because they produce higher initial production,”
 James Williams , president of WTRG Economics in London, Arkansas,
said by telephone.  The  offshore  rig count, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico,
gained two to 55, the most since April 2010.  Energy explorers such as  Chevron Corp .,  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc  and Transocean Ltd. have been directed by U.S. regulators to
suspend work aboard rigs that employ  General Electric Co .
devices connecting drilling tubes to safety gear and the sea
floor. The equipment must be retrieved so defective bolts can be
replaced, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental
Enforcement said in an alert issued on Jan. 29.  Canadian energy rigs  jumped for a sixth week, increasing by
six to 631, following a seasonal drilling pattern.  To contact the reporters on this story:
