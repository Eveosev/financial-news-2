China’s stocks  rose, capping a second
week of gains for the benchmark index, as reports showed exports
beat analysts’ estimates and inflation eased. Retail and auto
stocks rallied before the start of a weeklong holiday.  SAIC Motor Corp.  and Great Wall Motor Co. led automakers
higher after the nation’s passenger-vehicle sales exceeded
estimates last month. Department-store operator Dashang Group
Co. jumped 7.6 percent on speculation consumer spending will
expand during the Lunar New Year holiday. Government reports
showed exports jumped 25 percent last month, while the inflation
rate of 2 percent matched economists’ estimates.  “The economic data show a mild recovery is still under way
and that will continue to support the run-up in stock prices,”
 Wei Wei , an analyst at West China Securities Co. in Shanghai,
said by phone. “Trading is a bit light before the holidays.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index  added 0.6 percent to 2,432.40
at the close for a 0.6 percent gain this week. Trading volumes
were 19 percent lower than the 30-day average, according to
Bloomberg data. The  CSI 300 Index  rose 0.4 percent to 2,771.73
and the  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index  slid 0.4 percent. The
 Bloomberg China-US 55 Index  fell 1.8 percent yesterday and the
iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund sank 2.3 percent.  The Shanghai Composite has risen 24 percent from a three-
year low on Dec. 3 on signs economic growth is accelerating and
as regulators approved more investment quotas for foreign
investors. It’s valued at 13.4 times reported profit, near the
highest level since September 2011,  data  compiled by Bloomberg
show. The 100-day  volatility  was 17.8, compared with 17.5 over
the past year.  Trade Data  China’s exports and imports rose more than estimated in a
January that had five more working days than last year, helping
sustain a growth rebound in the world’s second-biggest economy.  Overseas shipments increased, the customs administration
said, compared with the 17.5 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey. Imports jumped 28.8 percent, exceeding
the 23.5 percent median forecast of analysts.  Inflation rose 2 percent in January from a year earlier,
decelerating from December’s 2.5 percent gain, the statistics
bureau said. That matched the median estimate of 35 analysts in
a Bloomberg survey. Producer prices fell 1.6 percent, narrowing
from a 1.9 percent decline in December, the agency said.  A gauge of consumer-discretionary companies in the CSI 300
added 2.8 percent to the highest level since November 2011.
SAIC, China’s largest carmaker, rose 7.4 percent to 18.46 yuan,
the biggest gain since April 2011. Great Wall Motor, the biggest
pickup truck maker, climbed 5.8 percent to 29.86 yuan.  Auto Sales  Passenger-vehicle sales surged 49 percent from a year
earlier to a monthly record 1.73 million units in January, the
state-backed China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said
in an e-mail yesterday. That compares with the 1.5 million unit
average of six analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Dashang Group surged 7.6 percent to 37.10 yuan. Chongqing
Department Store climbed 7.2 percent to 28.14 yuan.  Yinchuan
Xinhua Commercial (Group) Co.  added 1 percent to 16.18 yuan.  An improving economic outlook is set to give retail sales a
boost during the biggest buying season of the year. The Lunar
New Year is a period when consumers splurge on everything from
beauty products and jewelry to lavish family dinners. China’s
retail sales for January and February may rise 15.4 percent, the
fastest pace in 13 months, according to nine economists surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Financials Slump  Chinese financial companies, led by banks and developers,
fell the most among 10 industry groups on the CSI 300 today and
this week on concern the government may introduce measures to
curb gains in property prices and as valuations jumped since the
start of a bull-market rally two months ago.  The financial gauge slid 0.7 percent today and 2.2 percent
for the week. Still, it has rallied 41 percent since of the
bull-market rally on Dec. 3, the most among 10 industry groups.
The sub-gauge trades at 10.2 times reported earnings, near the
highest level since August 2011.  China Minsheng Banking Corp.  declined 4.4 percent to 10.52
yuan, adding to yesterday’s 6 percent plunge. Gemdale Corp.,
which reported contracted sales of 2.48 billion yuan for last
month, dropped 1.1 percent to 7.93 yuan.  Chinese B shares, created in 1992 for foreign investors,
have soared to a two-year high in Shenzhen on speculation that
more companies will seek to list in Hong Kong, where companies
are awarded higher valuations. Their Shanghai-traded peers,
which have lagged behind, may join the bonanza.  “Shanghai is cheap,”  Hao Hong , Bank of Communications
Co.’s Hong Kong-based China strategist, wrote in a Feb. 5 e-
mail. “The stocks have moved, but not as dramatically as
Shenzhen.”  -- Zhang Shidong . Editors: Allen Wan, Darren Boey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
