Russian investigators are seeking to
place opposition leader  Sergei Udaltsov  under house arrest for
violating travel restrictions after detentions for organizing
protest rallies in Moscow.  Udaltsov “spends a lot of time outside his place of
registration, his mobile phones are frequently off and that
makes it hard to summon him,” the Investigative Committee said
on its website. Udaltsov faces a maximum 10 years in prison
after being charged with conspiring to organize mass unrest,
investigators said Oct. 26.  Udaltsov, 35, has emerged as a protest leader as thousands
have taken to the streets to denounce alleged vote fraud in the
2011 parliamentary elections and the 13-year rule of President
Vladimir Putin.  The Investigative Committee’s charges against Udaltsov
stemmed from a documentary aired on the NTV television channel,
owned by state-controlled OAO Gazprom, in October. The show
accused Udaltsov of meeting with an official from Georgia, the
Caucasus country with which Russia fought an five-day war in
2008, in an effort to raise funding and organize riots in Moscow
and other regions.  The hearing about placing Udaltsov under house arrest will
be held tomorrow, the oppositionist said on his Twitter Inc.
“Let’s guess the result,” he wrote.  Udaltsov said by phone today that he never violated the
travel restrictions. In October, he said he “couldn’t
identify” himself in the NTV broadcast and rejected accusations
of plotting riots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
