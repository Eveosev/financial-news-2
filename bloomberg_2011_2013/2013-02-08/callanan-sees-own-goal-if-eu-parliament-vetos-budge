The European Parliament would harm
its own reputation if it follows through on threats to veto
budget plans in a secret ballot, said  Martin Callanan , a U.K.
Conservative and chairman of the European Conservatives and
Reformists Group of lawmakers.  Callanan predicted the Parliament would vote against the
European Union’s seven-year budget in March, if a two-day summit
in Brussels produces a deal to cut spending as expected. He said
the vote may take place by secret ballot so that lawmakers can
resist pressure from their home nations.  “The’re going to take the biggest vote they’ve taken in a
secret vote, less than a year before the European elections,”
Callanan told reporters in Brussels on the summit sidelines. “I
think it’ll be a massive own goal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
