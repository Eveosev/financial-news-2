(Corrects name of bank in headline, decimal places in
second, fourth paragraphs, date of report in second paragraph.)  The euro may fall to its lowest level
against the pound in two weeks as it breaks into a retracement
phase after its recent high, according to the Royal Bank of
Canada.  The 17-nation currency will target a level between 84.74
pence and 83.99 pence per  euro , the 38.2 percent and 50 percent
Fibonacci retracements of the Feb. 1 high of 87.17,  George Davis,  chief technical analyst for fixed-income and currency
strategy at RBC in Toronto, wrote yesterday in a note to
clients. The shared currency, which has strengthened 6.8 percent
versus the pound during the past three months, will find support
at the 61.8 percent retracement level of 83.24.  “We would be looking for this pullback to materialize over
the next month or so,” Davis wrote in an e-mail.  The euro declined 1.3 percent to 85.26 pence yesterday in
New York, after falling as much as 1.4 percent. The euro last
reached 83.99 on Jan. 24.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  Fibonacci analysis, based on the work of 13th century
mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, is founded
on the theory that prices rise or fall be certain percentages
after reaching a new high or low.  Support refers to an area on a graph where analysts expect
buy orders to be clustered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
