Currency volatility will probably
increase this year as trading volumes climb, Citigroup Inc.
said, citing trading platform and central bank figures.  Combined average daily volume on currency trading platforms
by CME Group Inc., Thomson Reuters Corp. and ICAP Plc was at
$381 billion last month, up from $290 billion in December and
$339 billion a year earlier, according to data compiled by  Greg Anderson , Citigroup’s North American head of Group-of-10
currency in New York.  “The fact that FX volume has accelerated is also a sign
that volatility is likely to remain higher than in 2012,”
Anderson wrote in a note to clients yesterday.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s  Group of Seven Volatility Index ,
based on three-month options on G7 nations’ currencies, closed
at 9.65 percent on Feb. 6, a level last seen in July. The gauge
dropped to a five-year low of 7.09 percent on Dec. 17.  U.K. currency-trading  volumes  fell to an average $1.92
trillion a day in October, 5 percent lower than six months
earlier, the Bank of England said on Jan. 29, citing its semi-
annual surveys. Volumes in the U.S.  declined  to $794 billion a
day in the same period, from $860 billion in the previous survey
in April, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last month.  Average daily  transactions  executed by traders in Canada
totaled $54 billion in October from $62 billion in April,
according to the Canadian Foreign Exchange Committee. Volumes in
Tokyo  climbed  6.3 percent to $301 billion in October versus six
months earlier, Japan’s Foreign Exchange Market Committee said.
Its Singapore counterpart also reported an  increase  of 2.8
percent to $361 billion over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
