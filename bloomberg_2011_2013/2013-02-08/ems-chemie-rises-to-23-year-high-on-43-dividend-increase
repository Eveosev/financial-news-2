EMS-Chemie Holding AG  rose to the
highest in more than 23 years for a second consecutive day as
the Swiss chemical producer said it would raise the dividend 43
percent after high-performance plastics sales bolstered profit.  EMS climbed as much as 4.1 percent to 244.40 Swiss francs,
the highest since at least Oct. 24, 1989, based on closing
prices, and was trading up 1.2 percent at 4:01 p.m. in Zurich.
 Volume  amounted to 53 percent of the three-month daily average.  Full-year earnings before interest and taxes rose 8.4
percent because of “lucrative business” selling polymers for
smartphones like Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy SIII, EMS
Chief Executive Officer  Magdalena Martullo-Blocher  said at a
press conference in Zurich. Herrliberg-based EMS plans a
dividend of 7.50 francs a share and a 2.50-franc extraordinary
dividend, compared with 7 francs a year earlier.  EMS showed “robust margins, rock-solid balance sheet and
top-line growth even in adverse market conditions,”  Patrick Rafaisz , an analyst at Bank Vontobel AG, said in a report to
clients. “Although the shares may react positively today, we
clearly need better earnings growth prospects to justify these
levels,” said Rafaisz, who has a reduce  recommendation  on EMS.  Ebit and net sales will probably rise slightly this year,
Martullo-Blocher said. The company will expand the sales and
development workforce 14 percent and add high-performance
polymer production capacity in 2013, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
