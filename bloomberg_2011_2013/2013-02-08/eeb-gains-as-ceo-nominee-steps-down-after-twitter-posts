Empresa de Energia de Bogota SA , the
Colombian capital’s power utility, gained for the first in five
days as Fernando Gomez turned down a nomination as chief
executive officer following media reports on his Twitter posts.  Gomez, named EEB president on Jan. 31, will be replaced by
Sandra Fonseca, according to a statement on EEB’s website. The
shares rose 1.5 percent to 1,315 pesos at 3:05 p.m. in Bogota.  The stock fell as much as 4.4 percent on Feb. 4 after W
Radio reported on its  website  that Gomez sent posts on his
personal Twitter account about a plan to merge city-controlled
utilities. Gomez also posted jokes about getting drunk,
according to W.  Gomez said in the statement that he turned down the
position so the company “wouldn’t be affected in any way in its
image or its earnings, as a result of the information published
by the media.”  Fonseca runs her own consultancy and formerly worked as a
Colombian energy regulator, according to the statement.  Gomez didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Link to Company News:  To contact the reporter on this story:
