Gold declined on speculation that
haven demand may wane as reports from the U.S. to China signaled
improving growth in the world’s two largest economies. Platinum
dropped for a second day, retreating from the highest since 2011.  Gold for immediate delivery lost as much as 0.2 percent to
$1,668.05 an ounce and traded at $1,671.05 at 10:25 a.m. in
Singapore. Prices are little changed this week after declining
0.4 percent yesterday. Gold for April delivery was little
changed at $1,670.60 an ounce on the Comex in New York.  The metal posted 12th annual gain last year as stimulus
programs in the U.S., Europe and Japan spurred demand for a
hedge against currency debasement and potential inflation. A
report from the U.S. Labor Department yesterday showed that the
number of applications for jobless benefits fell 5,000 to
366,000 in the week to Feb. 2. China’s total exports climbed 25
percent in January from a year earlier, the customs
administration said today, beating estimates. Gold is down 0.3
percent this year, compared with platinum’s 11 percent advance.  “We’re seeing people looking at the broader economy,
particularly the U.S. economy, and feeling relatively positive
and selling gold positions they accumulated when things were
looking less positive,” said  Nick Trevethan , an analyst at
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore. “Some
of the support from physical buying, particularly from China,
that we’ve seen so far this year is likely fading with the
upcoming Lunar New Year.”  China Imports  Imports into mainland China from Hong Kong rose 94 percent
to a record last year. The mainland imported 834,502 kilograms
(834.5 metric tons), including scrap and coins, from about
431,215 kilograms in 2011, Bloomberg calculations based on data
this week from the Census and Statistics Department of the Hong
Kong government. The country’s financial markets will be closed
next week to mark the Lunar New Year holiday.  Spot platinum fell as much as 0.7 percent to $1,706.75 an
ounce and traded at $1,715.75. The price, which is up 1.9
percent this week, reached the highest level since September
2011 yesterday, and investors boosted holdings to a record, on
concern supply may drop in South Africa, the largest producer.  Spot palladium dropped as much as 1.3 percent to $741.75 an
ounce, and was at $745.25, poised for a weekly loss. Silver for
immediate delivery was little changed at $31.50 an ounce, also
poised for a weekly loss.  To contact the reporter for this story:
