Kenya’s shilling gained for the first
time this week as the central bank accepted more bids than it
had offered for repurchase agreements.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy gained as
much as 0.3 percent as the Central Bank of Kenya accepted 3.9
billion shillings ($44 million) of bids for seven-day repurchase
agreements, having offered 2 billion shillings. The bank uses
the repos to reduce total money supply and support the shilling.  “The shilling has gained on tight liquidity as the central
bank continues to remove money from the market,” Joshua Anene,
a currency dealer at Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa
Ltd., said by phone.  The shilling strengthened to as much as 87.35 per dollar
and traded 0.2 percent up at 87.48 as of 3:31 p.m. in Nairobi.
The currency has retreated 0.3 percent this week.  Trading levels today are likely to be around 87.40 per
dollar to 87.80, Nairobi-based NIC Bank Ltd. said in a note to
clients.  Uganda’s currency weakened less than 0.1 percent to
2,651.50 per dollar, while the Tanzanian shilling rallied less
than 0.1 percent to 1,615 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
