Swedish industrial production rose
more than estimated in December as orders jumped.  Industrial production  rose 1.3 percent, after falling a
revised 1.5 percent in November, Stockholm-based Statistics
Sweden said today. Production was  estimated  to rise 0.2 percent,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of seven
economists. Output fell an annual 2.2 percent.  Swedenâ€™s central bank meets next week to decide whether to
cut its main lending rate for a fifth time since December 2011
to boost flagging growth in the export-dependent Nordic economy.  The Swedish economy will stage a slow recovery this year by
expanding 1.1 percent, after growth slowed to 0.9 percent, the
government estimates. Sweden exports about half of its output,
of which about 70 percent go to Europe.  Industrial orders from Swedish companies rose 7.7 percent
in the month and slid 2.8 percent in the year, Statistics Sweden
said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
