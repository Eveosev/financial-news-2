Cadbury Nigeria Plc , a manufacturer
of drinks and food products, rose to the highest in five years
after announcing plans to take full ownership of its Stanmark
Cocoa Processing Co. unit.  Cadbury shares climbed 5 percent to 38.87 naira at the
close in Lagos, the commercial capital, the highest level since
Feb. 15, 2008. About 730,500 shares changed hands, 102 percent
of the three-month daily average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Cadbury proposes to merge the companies to reduce the cost
of running Stanmark as a unit and bolster revenue, Kufre Ekanem,
a spokesman for Cadbury Nigeria, said Feb. 6.  Stanmark  has a
12,500-ton capacity plant that produces cocoa butter, liquor and
powder. It supplies the entire cocoa powder requirements for
Cadbury beverage products while the cocoa butter and liquor are
exported, Ekanem said.  “A 100 percent takeover of Stanmark will entail Cadbury
exercising direct control over its sources of raw materials,
which investors think will be better managed to enhance beverage
production, even increase cocoa exports.”  Raheem Mohammed ,
chief executive officer of Kundila Finance Ltd., said in a
telephone interview from Lagos.  Cadbury Nigeria’s net income for the nine months through
September advanced 34 percent to 2.08 billion naira ($13.2
million) from 1.56 billion naira a year earlier, it said in a
statement on Oct. 31. Revenue declined 2.4 percent to 24.1
billion naira.  The stock has climbed 34 percent this year, compared with a
18 percent gain for the Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-Share Index .  Nigeria is the fourth-largest cocoa producer after Ivory
Coast, Ghana and Indonesia, according to the London-based
International Cocoa Organization’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
