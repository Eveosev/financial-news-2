Treasury 10-year yields  posted  their
biggest weekly drop since November as efforts to trim the
European Union budget added to concern the region’s economy will
struggle to expand, boosting demand for safer assets.  U.S. debt was little changed after gaining earlier today as
German exports grew less than forecast in December, a report
showed. Treasuries declined briefly after a report showed the
U.S. trade deficit narrowed more than forecast in December,
which may indicate the economy expanded last quarter.  “The market is centered around the 2 percent level,”
 Jason Rogan , director of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim
Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage for institutional
investors. “We’re towards the low side of that pivot point. The
concerns over Europe have taken the market up and seem to be the
main driver of yields.”  The benchmark 10-year  yield  was little changed at 1.95
percent at 4:45 p.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. The 1.625 percent note due in November 2022
traded at 97 4/32.  The yield last touched 2 percent on Feb. 6 and reached 1.92
percent on Feb. 1, the least since Jan. 25. It fell seven basis
points this week, the most since the week ended Nov. 24.  Price Swings  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators  increased 
their net-long position in 10-year note futures in the week
ending Feb. 5, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data. Speculative long positions, or bets prices will
rise, gained 10 percent to 46,906 contracts on the Chicago Board
of Trade.  Traders increased bets on declines in 30-year bond futures
by 37 percent to the most since March, while trimming net long
positions 24 percent on five-year note futures, the data show.  Volatility  in Treasuries dropped to the lowest since Jan.
24. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index, which measures
price swings of U.S. government securities based on options, was
59.9 basis points yesterday after rising to 66.4 basis points on
Jan. 30, the most since Nov. 6.  The Federal Reserve bought $1.4 billion in inflation-
indexed debt due from April 2029 to February 2042 as part of its
so-called quantitative easing program to lower borrowing costs
and strengthen economic growth.  Debt Auctions  The Treasury kept next week’s so-called quarterly refunding
auctions at $72 billion, the amount sold since November 2010.
Given the government’s financing needs, it sells three-, 10- and
30-year securities each month in addition to its historical
quarterly offerings.  The U.S. will sell $32 billion in three-year notes on Feb.
12, $24 billion in 10-year notes on Feb. 13, and $16 billion in
30-year bonds on Feb. 14.  “I don’t think people want to set shorts too early in
front of the supply, but it weighs on their psychology a little
bit,” said  Guy Haselmann , an interest-rate strategist at Bank
of Nova Scotia in New York, one of 21 primary dealers that trade
with the Fed. “Markets have a tendency to trade a little heavy
in front of that supply.” A short position is a bet that an
asset will decline in value.  European Union leaders agreed to a seven-year budget that
cuts spending for the first time, bowing to U.K. Prime Minister
David Cameron’s insistence on thrift. The deal, struck after 25
1/2 hours of talks in Brussels, set the budget for 2014-2020 at
960 billion euros ($1.3 trillion), down from an original
proposal of 1.047 trillion euros and less than the 994 billion
euros spent in the current budget cycle.  German Economy  Germany’s exports gained 0.3 percent from November, when
they fell 2.2 percent, the Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden said today. Economists forecast a 1.4 percent
increase, according to the median of 15 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  The U.S. trade gap shrank 20.7 percent to $38.5 billion,
lower than any estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 73 economists
and the least since January 2010, Commerce Department figures
showed today in Washington. The jump in fuel sales to overseas
buyers, combined with purchases of the fewest barrels of
imported crude in almost 16 years, led to the smallest petroleum
deficit since August 2009.  “The trade number was not favorable to Treasuries because
it will add to gross domestic product,” said  David Coard , head
of fixed-income trading in New York at Williams Capital Group, a
brokerage for institutional investors. “It’s probably a
combination of the Dow flirting with 14,000, the trade number
was favorable for the economy and the markets are on the thin
side because a lot of people are out.”  A Commerce Department report on Jan. 30 showed the economy
shrank at a 0.1 percent annual rate in the final three months of
the year. The trade figures probably mean the economy managed to
eke out a gain when revised data are released on Feb 28.  U.S. sovereign debt has returned 0.2 percent this month,
according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. It handed
investors a 1 percent loss in January, the worst start to a year
since 2009 on signs the U.S. economy is improving.  To contact the reporters on this story:
