Zimbabwe’s National Constitutional
Assembly, a civic organization, will call on citizens to reject
a new constitution in a referendum in coming months, Chairman
 Lovemore Madhuku  said.  “The new constitutional proposal still leaves too much
power in the president’s hands,” Madhuku told reporters in
Johannesburg today.  The NCA and the Movement for Democratic Change, led by
Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai , successfully lobbied voters to
reject a constitution 13 years ago. Tsvangirai and President
 Robert Mugabe ’s Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front
have shared power since a disputed election in 2008. The two
leaders agreed last month on a new constitution that must be
approved in a referendum before elections can take place.  “If it was worth rejecting in 2000, why would it be worth
accepting now,” said Madhuku, a law professor based in
Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare. “The president will still appoint
all ministers and cabinet members, including a number who don’t
have to be elected, without any parliamentary approval or over-
sight.”  Zimbabwe may hold elections as soon as July if the
constitution is approved, Finance Minister  Tendai Biti  said Jan.
29. The previous vote was described by observers, including from
the European Union, as being flawed because of violence and
polling irregularities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
