Hong Kong  stocks  rose, with the
city’s benchmark index paring its weekly decline, as China’s
exports beat estimates and inflation slowed. Gaming shares rose
on a report Macau hotels are full for next week’s Lunar New Year
holiday.  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. , a casino operator founded
by billionaire Lui Che-Woo, rose 3.9 percent. China Minsheng
Banking Corp. slumped 2.6 percent after the lender’s 20 billion
yuan ($3.21 billion) convertible-bond sale was approved.
Soundwill Holdings Ltd. jumped 6.1 percent after Daiwa
Securities Group Inc. raised the developer’s target price.  The  Hang Seng Index  added 0.2 percent to 23,215.16 at the
close after falling as much as 0.3 percent. The gauge lost 2.1
percent for the week, the steepest such decline since November.
About two stocks rose for each that fell on the gauge today,
with trading volume about 9.5 percent above the 30-day average
for the time of day. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
mainland companies lost 0.3 percent to 11,649.78.  “Many investors are taking a wait-and-see attitude”
before the Lunar New Year holidays, said Peter Lai, director of
sales at brokerage DBS Vickers Hong Kong Ltd. “China’s economy
is picking up. I’m still bullish on the market for this half of
this year because of fund flows. For the second half, we are not
sure if figures coming from the U.S., China and Europe will be
positive, and Europe’s debt could be a problem again.”  Hong Kong’s market will be shut three days next week for
the Lunar New Year holidays, while markets in mainland China
will be closed all week. The Hang Seng Index surged 22 percent
from the end of August through January, when the gauge capped
its longest monthly winning streak since July 2009. Shares rose
amid signs of recovery in the U.S. and China, and as central
banks around the globe added stimulus.  Inflation Report  China’s consumer prices rose 2 percent from a year earlier,
decelerating from a 2.5 percent gain a month earlier, the
government said. A separate report showed China’s exports rose
25 percent in January from a year earlier, exceeding the 17.5
percent median of economists’ estimates.  Galaxy Entertainment climbed 3.9 percent to HK$33.55. SJM
Holdings Ltd., founded by tycoon Stanley Ho, jumped 7.6 percent
to HK$20.50. Wynn Macau Ltd. added 4.4 percent to HK$20.30.  Seventeen major casino hotels in Macau were fully booked
from Feb. 12 through Feb. 14 for the Chinese holiday, according
to Karen Tang, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Deutsche Bank AG.
The surge may help boost monthly gaming revenue 15 percent from
a year earlier to $27.9 billion patacas ($3.5 billion), she
said.  Soundwill rose 6.1 percent to HK$22.70 after Daiwa
Securities raised the Hong Kong property manager’s  target price 
to HK$28.40 from HK$13.95, while maintaining its buy rating.  Europe’s Recovery  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.1
percent. The gauge yesterday slid 0.2 percent as corporate
earnings reports disappointed and European policy makers warned
the euro’s advance could hamper the region’s recovery.  China Minsheng  dropped 2.6 percent to HK$10.72. The China
Securities Regulatory Commission approved the lender’s
convertible-bond sale, according to a statement to the Shanghai
Stock Exchange yesterday.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index climbed 0.2 percent to
23,242. The  HSI Volatility Index  rose 0.2 percent to 14.25,
indicating traders expect a swing of 4.1 percent for the equity
benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
