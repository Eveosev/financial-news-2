The cost of insuring against default
on  Telecom Italia SpA ’s bonds surged for a fifth week on concern
the company faces a downgrade after missing debt targets.  Credit-default swaps linked to the Milan-based company rose
three basis points to 315 at 10:18 a.m. in London and have risen
25 basis points this week. The contracts are the worst-
performing among companies in Markit’s iTraxx Europe index of
125 investment-grade companies over the week.  Italy’s biggest phone company, whose debt is more than
double its market value, said it cut borrowings to 28.3 billion
euros ($38 billion), compared with a target of 27.5 billion
euros, when it posted a 4.2 percent drop in earnings today.
Telecom Italia and other European former phone monopolies are
suffering as competition and contracting economies crimp sales
and margins.  “It’s highly probable Telecom Italia will be downgraded,”
said  Sam Morton , a credit analyst at Mizuho International Plc.
“The results confirmed the company is struggling to meet
deleveraging targets.”  Telecom Italia has an investment  grade  ranking of BBB at
Standard & Poor’s and an equivalent Baa2 from Moody’s Investors
Service, two steps above junk. The ratings have negative
outlooks.  The company’s 4 percent bond due 2020 fell 0.38 cents on
the euro to 98.76 euro cents, the notes’ first decline since
Jan. 30, Bloomberg prices show.  New Issues  In the new issue market, Anglian Water Services Financing
Plc is selling 200 million pounds ($315 million) of 13-year
secured bonds at 230 basis points to 235 basis points more than
gilts, a person with knowledge of the deal said. It’s the
company’s first bond since April, when it issued 250 million
pounds of 15-year notes, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Edcon (Proprietary) Ltd. is marketing 325 million euros of
high-yield bonds, having dropped plans to sell a dollar-
denominated portion, a person with knowledge of the transaction
said. The sale will be the company’s largest in the currency
since June 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  In credit derivatives markets, the Markit iTraxx Europe
Index fell one basis point to 117, curbing a weekly rise to six
basis points.  The  Markit iTraxx Crossover Index  of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly speculative-grade ratings dropped
five to 452, and is up 21 basis points this week, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of swaps on 25 banks and
insurers declined two basis points to 157, lowering the increase
on the week to 12 basis points.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A basis point on
a contract protecting 10 million euros of debt for five years is
equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
