West Brom said it took an undisclosed
disciplinary action against forward Peter Odemwingie after he
attempted to move to Queens Park Rangers without the permission
of his Premier League soccer club.  “Odemwingie has accepted his punishment,” West Brom said
today in an e-mailed statement. “He will now resume full
training with his teammates and is available for first-team
selection.”  Odemwingie drove to west London Jan. 31, the last day of
the transfer window, to meet with QPR officials without the
approval of the Baggies, who accused the Nigerian of acting
unprofessionally.  QPR turned him away, and the player, who still has 18
months left on his contract, had to return to West Brom, which
stopped him from training with the first team or playing in
matches.  “I understand how my actions have been viewed and want
to apologise to the club and our supporters for any distress I
have caused,” Odemwingie said in the statement. “We have
enjoyed a good season so far and I aim to play my part in
keeping the club as high up the table as possible.”  West Brom is in ninth place in the 20-team Premier League.
QPR is in last place, and coach Harry Redknapp brought in
several players last month in an attempt to move the team up the
standings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
