Linx SA, the Brazilian communications
technology provider, rallied 18.5 percent on its first day of
trading following the country’s first initial public offering
this year.  Shares of Linx, which priced at 27 reais in the IPO, surged
to 32.00 reais at the close of trading in Sao Paulo. The
benchmark Bovespa index rose 0.2 percent.  Linx , which provides communications technology and
management software for retailers, is raising as much as 527.9
million reais ($267.9 million) in the offering, according to a
statement Feb. 6. The company and its underwriters had estimated
the shares would price within a range of 23 to 27 reais,
according to a Jan. 18 prospectus.  “We can say the IPO was a success, as the share move today
reinforces,” Sandro Fernandes, a trader at brokerage Corval,
said by phone from Belo Horizonte, Brazil. “That’s a sign
investors are a little more optimistic about Brazilian stocks.”  Linx sold 12.7 million of new shares and previous investors
including Brazil’s development bank BNDES sold a further 6.84
million. The stock will be listed in Bovespa’s Novo Mercado
section, where only voting shares can trade and at least 25
percent of a company’s stock must be available for trading.  The company’s IPO is Brazil’s first since furniture-maker
 Unicasa Industria de Moveis SA  raised 425.6 million reais in
April 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
