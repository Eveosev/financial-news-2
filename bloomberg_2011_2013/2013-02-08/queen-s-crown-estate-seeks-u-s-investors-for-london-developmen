Britain’s Crown Estate, the property
company that generates income for  Queen Elizabeth II , is seeking
investors from the U.S., Canada and Australia to fund the

Market into offices and shops, spokesman Mike Norris said by
phone. The project will require around 320 million pounds ($507
million) of investment and will create 19,500 square meters
(210,000 square feet) of offices and 4,650 square meters of
shops, he said.  The Crown Estate last month won permission from the
Westminster borough for a 450 million-pound St. James’s

meters, about half of which will be offices and shops.  The Financial Times reported the news earlier today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
