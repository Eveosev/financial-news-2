Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.  beat
Lockheed Martin Corp. to retain its biggest U.S. government
contract, an agreement with the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration valued at as much as $1.93 billion.  The award is for engineering and technology work at Johnson
Space Center in Houston, NASA said today in a statement. It is
for a maximum of nine years.  Jacobs, based in Pasadena, California, has held the
contract since at least 2004, according to a NASA statement.  Michelle Jones , a spokeswoman for Jacobs, didn’t
immediately return a phone call seeking comment.  Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed bid on the contract and
doesn’t plan to protest NASA’s decision, Lindsay Wilson, a
company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  “Although we are disappointed with the decision, Lockheed
Martin remains committed to delivering critical capabilities for
NASA,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
