U.S. soybean supplies before the
next harvest will be 7.4 percent smaller than forecast a
month ago and the smallest since 2004 on rising demand for
last year’s drought-reduced crop, the government said.  Stockpiles  on Aug. 31 will fall to 125 million bushels
(3.4 million metric tons), down from 135 million estimated
in January and 169 million a year earlier, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said today in a report. The
average estimate of 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News
was 130 million. Soybean prices have dropped 17 percent
since a record in September as South American farmers
planted more for a harvest just getting under way.  “This is a signal to the market that prices are not
high enough to slow demand for tightening supplies in the
U.S.,”  James Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Co. in
Fowler, Indiana, said before the report. “It’s going to be
very tough to buy supplies in the U.S. this summer.”  Reduced supplies have cut margins for meat producers
 Tyson Foods Inc.  and Smithfield Foods Inc., which buy soy-
based animal feed. Oilseed processors such as Bunge Ltd.
and  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.  may benefit from an animal-
feed shortage. The central Illinois crush  spread  -- the
difference between the cost of a bushel of soybeans and the
value of the meal and oil it can produce -- is more than 50
percent higher than the average of the past two years.  Futures Rise  Soybean futures for March delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$14.885 a bushel at 9:22 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Soybean meal for March delivery added 0.1 percent to
$438.1 for 2,000 pounds. The high-protein animal feed
surged 34 percent in 2012 and has climbed 4.5 percent this
year.  The  forecast  for U.S. crushings of soybeans into
animal feed and cooking oil in the marketing year that
began Sept. 1 was raised to 1.615 billion bushels, from
1.605 billion estimated in January. The previous year’s
total was 1.703 billion. Sales of soybean meal as of the
end of January were up 43 percent from a year earlier,
while soybean-oil export sales tripled.  The average farm-gate price this year will be a record
$14.30 a bushel, compared with $14.25 estimated a month ago
and $12.50 last year, the USDA said.  World Production  World  soybean  production will total 269.5 million
tons, more than the 269.41 million forecast in January,
according to the report. In the previous year, output was
238.73 million tons.  Brazil is projected to pass the U.S. as the top
producer for the first time. Its output was forecast at a
record 83.5 million tons, up from 82.5 million estimated in
January and 66.5 million a year ago. Analysts expected
production to rise to 82.7 million, on average. The U.S.
crop is forecast at 82.06 million tons.  Argentina, the biggest shipper of soy-based animal
feed and vegetable oil, may harvest 53 million tons, down
from 54 million estimated last month and up from 40.1
million last year, the USDA said. Analysts expected 52.9
million tons.  Global  inventories  of the oilseed on Sept. 30 will be
60.12 million tons, up from 59.46 million forecast in
January, the USDA said. A year earlier, supplies totaled
55.25 million. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected
59.07 million, on average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
