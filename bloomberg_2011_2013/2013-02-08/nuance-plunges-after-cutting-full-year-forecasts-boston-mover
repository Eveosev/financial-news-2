Nuance Communications Inc., a maker
of speech-recognition software, plunged the most in more than
six years after the company lowered its full-year sales and
earnings forecast as new technology curbed use of older
transcription services.  The stock  retreated  19 percent to $20 at the close in New
York, for the biggest decline since August 2006. The stock has
lost 10 percent this year, compared with a 6.7 percent advance
for the Russell 1,000 Index.  Nuance, which specializes in technology for the health care
industry and for mobile devices, cut its fiscal 2013 sales
 forecast  to $2.15 billion to $2.2 billion yesterday, down from a
November projection of $2.17 billion to $2.22 billion. The
Burlington, Massachusetts-based company also lowered its
adjusted earnings forecast to $1.76 to $1.87 a share, from $1.84
to $1.94.  Nuance said that transcription volume is falling as
customers in the health industry transition to electronic
medical records and its new Dragon Medical speech-to-text
software. A contraction in the market for personal-computers,
exacerbated as corporate customers postponed spending to await
the Microsoft Corp.’s new Windows 8 software, also contributed
to the forecast reduction. In Europe, a sluggish economy is also
prompting businesses to curb spending.  “These factors have undermined the bull thesis that Nuance
is riding a secular wave of growth in mobile and health care,
and likely put the stock in the penalty box until growth can
accelerate,”  Mark Murphy , an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos.,
wrote in a research report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
