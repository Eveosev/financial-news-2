European Union carbon permits headed
for their biggest two-week gain since August, as nations weigh
intervening in the market and natural gas and power contracts
advanced.  EU allowances for December rose 7.6 percent to 4.52 euros a
metric ton, taking the weekly increase to 4.2 percent, according
to data from ICE Futures Europe in London. They rose 5.6 percent
last week. United Nations Certified Emission Reduction credits
for December were unchanged at 33 cents at 12:15 p.m.  The EU rescue plan to temporarily limit supply of
allowances in the carbon market is increasingly likely to win
majority support from the European Parliament’s environment
committee, Matthias Groote, chairman of the European
Parliament’s environment committee, said yesterday. The EU draft
strategy to support the carbon market has divided governments,
industry organizations and members of the Parliament.  German power for 2014 rose 1.3 percent to 42.25 euros a
megawatt-hour, according to broker prices compiled by Bloomberg.
U.K. gas for the six months through September advanced 0.7
percent on ICE, extending the contract’s gain since June 22 to
15 percent.  Carbon sometimes tracks natural gas prices as rising costs
boost the appeal of other fuels such as dirtier coal, which
requires twice the amount of emission allowances to burn than
gas. Higher power prices also increase the incentive for
utilities to sell forward and hedge by buying fuel and carbon
contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
