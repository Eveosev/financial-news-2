Canadian housing starts plunged 19
percent in January to their lowest since the end of the 2009
recession as builders scaled back plans for condominiums.  The annual  pace  of work fell to 160,577 in January from
197,118 in December, Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. said in a
 statement  today from Ottawa. Economists forecast a January
reading of 195,000, according to the median of 21 responses to a
Bloomberg News survey.  The country’s housing market is cooling after policy makers
took measures to tighten mortgage lending last year amid concern
that a bubble was building in some markets. Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  tightened rules on government-insured mortgages in July
for the fourth time in four years, while the Office of the
Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the country’s banking
regulator, introduced tougher standards for mortgage lenders.  “Today’s data suggest homebuilding is set to swing from an
economic positive in 2012 to a drag in 2013,”  Emanuella Enenajor , an economist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto, said in
a note to investors.  Multiple-unit starts in urban areas fell 29 percent to
78,816 in January from 110,927 in December. Single-detached home
starts fell 11 percent. Urban housing starts in Ontario plunged
44 percent, and were down 30 percent in Quebec.  To contact the reporter on this story:
