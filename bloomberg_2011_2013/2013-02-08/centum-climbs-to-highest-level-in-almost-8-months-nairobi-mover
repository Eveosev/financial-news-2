Centum Investment Co. , Kenya’s
largest publicly traded investment group, rose to its highest
level in almost eight months.  The stock advanced for a fourth day, gaining 4.7 percent to
14.45 shillings by the close in Nairobi, the highest price since
June 18. About 72 percent of the three-month daily average of
shares traded.  Shares in Centum have climbed 18 percent this year after
dropping 8.5 percent in the 12 months to December, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Last month Centum announced it has
acquired 45 percent of Platcorp Holdings Ltd., a lender in
Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.  “Guys are accumulating the stock following the fall in
price last year and as they look at the future prospects,”
Rufus Mwanyasi, head trader at Nairobi-based Canaan Capital
Ltd., said in a phone interview.  Canaan has a short-term price target of 15.65 shillings and
a buy recommendation, he said.  “The share price is a reflection of investor confidence
after they bought Platcorp,”  Ted Macharia , a research analyst
at Nairobi-based AIB Capital, said by phone today. “The banking
sector has very strong growth and small businesses which cannot
be covered by banks or private equity get financing from micro
finance institutions like Platcorp.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
