SunPower Corp. , the second-largest
U.S. solar manufacturer, declined after slumping prices for
photovoltaic panels contributed to a wider fourth-quarter loss.  SunPower fell 5.6 percent to $7.93 at the close in New
York. Earlier it dropped as much as 10 percent, the most
intraday since Jan. 7.  The fourth-quarter net loss widened to $144.8 million, or
$1.22 a share, from $93 million, or 94 cents a share, a year
earlier, as panel prices plunged, San Jose, California-based
SunPower said yesterday in a statement. The company was expected
to lose 78 cents a share, the average of four analysts’
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  “We look at this as the most overvalued stock in the solar
space,”  Pavel Molchanov , a Raymond James & Associates Inc.
analyst in Houston, said in a note to investors today. Molchanov
reiterated his rating, the equivalent of sell, “in the context
of our generally negative view on the structurally oversupplied
module market.”  SunPower, majority-owned by French oil company Total SA,
and its competitors are contending with a global oversupply that
pulled down panel prices industrywide by  31 percent  last year to
64 cents a watt.  The company produced 153 megawatts of panels in the fourth
quarter and 936 megawatts in all of 2012. It expects to produce
150 megawatts to 170 megawatts in the current quarter.  First Solar, the largest U.S. solar panel manufacturer,
produced 1.36 gigawatts of panels through the third quarter and
 said  Nov. 1 that it expected to ship 1.2 gigawatts of panels for
the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
