Doughty Hanson & Co.  said it will
stop investing in venture capital and real estate following the
death last year of one of the private-equity firm’s founders,
 Nigel Doughty .  Doughty Hanson, which has bought and sold stakes in firms
including celebrity addiction clinic the Priory and watchmaker
TAG Heuer, will continue to invest in private equity, the
London-based company said today in a  statement . Co-founder  Dick Hanson  has resumed his role as head of private equity and
executive chairman, it said.  The private-equity firm is refocusing on its core business
after Doughty’s death in February 2012 and follows a
reorganization of its partnership structure in July, which made
Hanson the joint owner with an employee trust. While the firm
will continue to manage its real estate and technology
investments, it will raise no new funds for the ventures.  “We have spent considerable time speaking with our
investors and reflecting on the future of the business,”
 Stephen Marquardt , Doughty Hanson’s chief executive officer,
said in the statement. “While we have had notable successes in
both real estate and technology ventures, the real heritage of
Doughty Hanson lies in its private-equity business.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
