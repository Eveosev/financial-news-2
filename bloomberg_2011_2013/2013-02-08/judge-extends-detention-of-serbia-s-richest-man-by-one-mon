Miroslav Miskovic , Serbia’s richest
man will remain in detention for another month as an
investigation continues into alleged corruption in the sale of
state road companies, a judge said.  Miskovic, 67, and his son Marko, will be detained for
another 30 days to make sure they do not flee the country, Maja
Kovacevic-Tomic, a judge at the Higher Belgrade Court, said in a
phone interview. Their release could also “disturb the public”
and “interfere with the investigation,” she said.  Miskovic, the owner of closely-held  Delta Holding , and his
son were arrested on Dec. 12 on suspicion of illegally earning
more than 30 million euros ($39 million) in the sale of state
road companies. The government has pledged to step up fight
against corruption.  A company statement in December said “we are absolutely
certain that the activities of Delta Holding and its owner,
Miroslav Miskovic, are in accordance with the law, and we are
fully cooperating with the authorities.”  Judges can keep Miskovic in detention for as much as six
months as part of the investigation process, Kovacevic-Tomic
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
