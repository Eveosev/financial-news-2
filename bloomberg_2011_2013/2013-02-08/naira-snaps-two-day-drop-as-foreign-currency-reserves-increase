The naira gained for the first time
in three days after data from the Central Bank of Nigeria showed
the country’s foreign-currency reserves increased.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer rallied as
much as 0.3 percent, the most since Jan. 25, as the nation’s
 foreign-exchange reserves  advanced to $46.15 billion, according
to data from the Abuja-based central bank, the highest since at
least July 2010.  The increase to external reserves will provide a buffer
against occasional demand pressures on the naira, which is
likely to retain its present strength, analysts at the Lagos-
based Financial Markets Dealers Association wrote in a report on
its website.  The naira traded less than 0.1 percent stronger at 157.25
per dollar as of 2:42 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital,
giving a gain of less than 0.1 percent in the week.  The naira is being supported in part by portfolio inflows,
central bank Governor  Lamido Sanusi  said after the Jan. 21
policy meeting, where the bank held benchmark interest rates at
a record high 12 percent for an eighth straight time. Nigeria’s
bond yields have dropped to record lows as JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
the world’s biggest underwriter of emerging-market debt, added
the securities to its benchmark GBI-EM index in October.
Barclays Plc is adding Nigerian debt to its local-currency
government bond index next month.  Yields Decline  One-year Treasury bill yields fell to the lowest in 16
months at an auction on Feb. 6 as investor inflows pushed the
subscription rate to a record. The regulator sold 117 billion
naira ($744 million) of 364-day bills at a yield of 10.6
percent, the lowest since a Sept. 29, 2011 sale. Bids totaled
342 billion naira, the highest on record.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 declined seven basis points to 10.86 percent in the
secondary market, according to yesterday’s data compiled on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Borrowing costs
on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021 rose one
basis point to 4.109 percent today.  Ghana’s cedi gained less than 0.1 percent to 1.9015 per
dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
