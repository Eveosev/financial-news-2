Robusta coffee, used in instant
drinks and espresso, climbed to the highest level in more than
four months in London as selling from Vietnam, the variety’s
biggest grower, slowed ahead of the Lunar New Year. Sugar rose.  Vietnamese farmers, who have been holding back beans
looking for higher prices, may increase “retention” after Tet,
the festival that celebrates the Lunar New Year, Volcafe, the
coffee unit of commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd., said
in a report e-mailed Jan. 25. Sales prior to the holidays, which
start this weekend and run through Feb. 17, were about 40
percent of the 2012-13 crop compared with 45 percent a year
earlier, the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of eight
traders and shippers published on Feb. 1 showed.  “The principal hedging origin, Vietnam, is now heading
into holiday season,” London-based broker ABN Amro Markets U.K.
Ltd. said in a report e-mailed today. “This does not completely
remove selling but means it may be more sporadic over the next
week or so.”  Robusta coffee for delivery in March climbed 1.2 percent to
$2,123 a metric ton by 12:43 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. The
price touched $2,145 a ton, the highest since Oct. 5. Arabica
coffee for delivery in March gained 0.4 percent to $1.408 a
pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier, it touched
$1.394 a pound, the lowest since June 2010. Trading of arabica
was more than double the average volume of the past 100 days at
this time, according to data on Bloomberg.  Robusta coffee for March delivery was $12 a ton more
expensive than the beans from May, reversing a discount of $10 a
ton in the first trading day of the week. That structure, where
nearby contracts are valued higher than later-dated ones, is
called backwardation and may signal tight supplies.  Stockpiles of robusta coffee in warehouses monitored by
Liffe fell 3 percent to 102,410 tons by Feb. 4 from two weeks
earlier, exchange data yesterday showed. Inventories are down 75
percent from an all-time high of 417,420 tons in July 2011.  Arabica coffee, favored by Starbucks Corp., is fetching the
 smallest premium  over robusta in almost four years as reserves
in ICE-monitored warehouses stood at 2.6 million bags yesterday,
the highest since 2010. The premium touched 43.295 cents a
pound, the lowest since March 17, 2009. A bag of coffee usually
weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  White, or refined, sugar for May delivery was down 0.4
percent at $495 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Raw sugar for delivery in
March gained 0.1 percent to 18.18 cents a pound on ICE.  Cocoa for delivery in March fell 0.5 percent to 1,450
pounds ($2,289) a ton in London. Cocoa for delivery in May was
little changed at $2,233 a ton in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
