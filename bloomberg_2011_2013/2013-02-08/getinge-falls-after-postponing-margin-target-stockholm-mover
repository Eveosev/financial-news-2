Getinge AB , a Swedish maker of
sterilization systems sold in more than 100 countries, fell the
most in more than a week in Stockholm after the company said it
won’t reach its operating margin target this year or in 2014.  The shares declined as much as 3.1 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since Jan. 28, and were down 2.7 percent to 193.70
kronor as of 11:30 a.m. in the Swedish capital, giving the
company a market value of 47.4 billion kronor ($7.39 billion).  Getinge postponed its goal of reaching an margin on
earnings before interest, taxes and amortization of about 22
percent to 2015, due to lower demand, a more challenging
currency situation and higher costs related to a U.S. medical
device tax, according to a statement. Getinge, based in the
Swedish town of the same name, is in the process of
concentrating manufacturing to fewer plants and moving
production to low-cost countries.  “In terms of the profit trend for the current year, growth
is expected to become stronger during the second half of the
year compared with the first six months,” said Getinge, which
is hosting a capital markets day in Stockholm. “Earnings in the
first quarter of 2013 are expected to be lower than in the year-
earlier period.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
