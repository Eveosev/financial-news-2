Romania’s leu weakened for a fifth
day, heading for its worst weekly slide in four months, after
investors’ appetite for the country’s local bonds faded at
yesterday’s debt auction.  The currency headed for its longest stretch of losses from
Jan. 1 after the central bank lifted a limit on the size of its
weekly repurchase agreement auctions on Feb. 4 and demand at the
government’s bond sales plunged. The leu gained 1.8 percent over
the last month as JPMorgan Chase & Co. said it would include
some of Romania’s debt into its emerging-market bond index from
March.  “For now, we remain in a state of very precarious
equilibrium” for the leu,  Mihai Patrulescu , a Bucharest-based
senior economist at UniCredit Tiriac Bank SA wrote in a note
today. “Market interest for leu-denominated bond has cooled
down since January and demand conditions deteriorated.”  The leu declined less than 0.1 percent to 4.3963 per euro
by 3:06 p.m. in Bucharest, bringing its loss this week to 0.6
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Romania raised 500 million lei ($153 million) in five-year
bonds yesterday, with the average yield rising 39 basis points,
or 0.39 percentage point, to 5.79 percent. Demand plunged to 852
million lei from 3.9 billion at a similar-maturity bond auction
on Jan. 17.  The Banca Nationala a Romaniei increased the auction limit
to 10 billion lei ($3.1 billion), from 9 billion lei a week
earlier as commercial banks’ demand for the leu reached a record
38.5 billion lei.  To contact the reporters on this story:
