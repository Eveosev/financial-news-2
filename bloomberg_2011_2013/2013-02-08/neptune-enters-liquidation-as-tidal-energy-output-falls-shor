Neptune Renewable Energy Ltd., a U.K.
maker of tidal-power turbines, will be liquidated after its
products failed to generate enough electricity to be profitable.  “The chosen approach is technically flawed and therefore
not suitable for the development of commercial arrays,” the
company said today in a statement on its  website . “There is no
commercial value in pursuing the project any further.”  Neptune, which deployed its demonstration Proteus turbine
in the River Humber in January 2012, found late last year that
it produced less power than expected. The company’s collapse is
a blow to Britain’s wave and tidal-energy industry as developers
seek funding to turn pilot ventures into marketable businesses.
No commercial-scale projects are currently in operation.  Neptune, set up in North Ferriby, England, in 2005 with
private funds, planned to deploy a tidal stream array in the
Humber in the next two years to supply industrial clients before
expanding to other U.K. sites. It supplied power to The Deep, an
aquarium in Hull, after winning a supply contract last May.  The government has said energy from the waves and tides has
the potential to meet as much as 20 percent of current U.K.
electricity demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
