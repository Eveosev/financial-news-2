CME Group Inc., the world’s largest
futures exchange, raised  margin requirements  on its yen
contracts as part of its normal review process of changes in
volatility to ensure adequate collateral coverage.  Initial margin for Japanese yen futures was raised to
$2,860 for speculators, from $2,475, and increased to $2,600 for
hedgers and CME members, from $2,250. Maintenance margin was
boosted for both speculators and hedgers to $2,600, from $2,250,
Chicago-based CME Group said in a notice on its website. The
changes take effect at the close of business today, it said.  In the spot market, the Japanese currency climbed 1 percent
today to 92.68 per dollar, paring its slide this year to 6.4
percent.  The CME’s yen futures are valued in dollar-per-yen terms as
compared with the cash market, which is yen-per-dollar. The
future has an underlying contract size of 12.5 million yen
($134,815).  Initial margin is the minimum amount of cash or eligible
securities investors must deposit to cover the risk of default.  The CME is adjusting margin requirements, including both
increases and decreases, on 18 different foreign-exchange
contracts from developed nation as well as emerging-nation
currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
