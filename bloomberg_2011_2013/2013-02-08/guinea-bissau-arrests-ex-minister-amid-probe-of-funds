The former finance minister of Guinea
Bissau,  Jose Mario Vaz , was arrested on charges of embezzlement,
according to the attorney-general.  Vaz has been detained in the capital, Bissau, since Feb. 4
while investigations continue “to find out what happened with
$12.5 million donated by the Angolan government for budget
support,”, the office of the attorney-general said in a
document. He is “the only source who can explain where the
money is,” according to the note.  Vaz, who was finance minister from 2009 until a coup in
April last year, will appear before a criminal court, state-run
Radio Difusao Nacional said Feb. 6. Octavio Lopes, a lawyer for
Vaz, told Jornal Digital he won’t comment on the case.  Angola suspended aid and military training to the former
Portuguese colony after the overthrow of interim President
 Raimundo Pereira , who was deposed two weeks before elections
were due to take place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
