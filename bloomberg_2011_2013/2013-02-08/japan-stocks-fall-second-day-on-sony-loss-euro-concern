Japanese  shares  fell, with the Nikkei
225 Stock Average ending its longest streak of weekly wins since
1959, as  Sony Corp.  plunged on an unexpected loss and amid
eurozone recovery concern.  Sony slumped 10 percent, the television maker’s biggest
drop since November 2008.  Nintendo Co. , a maker of game consoles
that gets 34 percent of its sales in Europe, fell 2.7 percent.
Asahi Glass Co. declined 6.9 percent after its earnings forecast
fell short of estimates. Yamada Denki Co. gained 5.8 percent
after the consumer-electronics retailer said operating profit
will beat expectations.  The  Nikkei 225  slid 1.8 percent to close at 11,153.16 in
Tokyo. The gauge fell 0.3 percent this week after rising 12
weeks through Feb. 1. The broader Topix Index slipped 1.2
percent to 957.35, with about four stocks falling for each that
rose. The decline ended a 13-week rally, the longest since 1973,
according to Bloomberg data.  “I think investors are ready to take profit when the
market’s momentum wanes,” said  Ichiro Yamada , general manager
of equities who helps oversee about 300 billion yen ($3.2
billion) at Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance. “Earnings results
don’t impress me. They may be OK until the beginning of the next
fiscal year on the back of a weaker yen, but we don’t know how
they will do after that.”  The Topix has surged about 33 percent since elections were
announced on Nov. 14 amid optimism a new government will take
aggressive steps to weaken the yen and beat deflation. The gauge
is trading at 1.1 times  book value , compared with 2.1 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.4 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index.  Earnings Results  Of the 207 companies on the Topix that have reported
earnings so far this quarter and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 63 percent have exceeded profit expectations. Some 54
percent missed sales projections, the data show.  Sony plunged 10 percent to 1,365 yen after yesterday
posting an eighth straight quarterly loss, and again cut sales
targets for TVs, gaming devices and compact cameras.  Asahi Glass slid 6.9 percent to 617 yen after saying net
income for the year ended Dec. 31 fell 54 percent from a year
earlier.  Yamada Denki added 5.8 percent to 3,625 yen after saying it
expects a 57.3 billion yen operating profit for the fiscal year,
beating an estimate of 52.4 billion.  Fujitsu Ltd. added 5.1 percent to 434 yen after the
computer manufacturer said it will cut 5,000 jobs and merge its
chip business with Panasonic Corp.
      Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. , Japan’s top nickel producer,
jumped 7.1 percent to 1,607 yen as it will slow the pace of
investments in the next three years and shift focus to spending
on raw material assets as competition for resources intensifies.  Current Account  Japan today posted back-to-back monthly current-account
deficits for the first time since at least 1985, highlighting
challenges for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s campaign to revive
the economy. Separately, China reported today its exports rose
more than estimated in January and consumer-price gains slowed
from a year earlier.  Futures on the S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent today. The measure
dropped 0.2 percent yesterday after European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  signaled policy makers are concerned that
the euro’s advance could damp inflation and hamper an economic
recovery.  Nintendo lost 2.7 percent to 8,680 yen and  Canon Inc. , a
camera maker that gets 30 percent of its revenue in Europe, slid
2.3 percent to 3,235 yen.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index  added 4.6 percent
to 27.71, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.9 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Japan’s Nikkei 225
February options settled today at 11,151.92, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
