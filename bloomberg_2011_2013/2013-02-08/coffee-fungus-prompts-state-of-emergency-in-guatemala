Guatemala declared a state of
emergency to address a worsening outbreak of coffee fungus in
Central America’s biggest economy.  President  Otto Perez Molina  said the government will set
aside 40 million quetzales ($5.1 million) to buy pesticides and
provide support to small farmers that represent 55 percent of
the coffee growers in the country. An additional 60 million
quetzales will go to similar projects for larger farmers.  “This is not a problem just for coffee growers, it’s a
social problem that will have side effects and repercussions in
the loss of jobs,” Perez Molina said in a  statement  posted on
the government’s website today.  The Guatemalan National Coffee Association said that rust
disease, known as roya in Spanish, will destroy 15 percent of
the 2012-2013 harvest and as much as 40 percent of next season’s
harvest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
