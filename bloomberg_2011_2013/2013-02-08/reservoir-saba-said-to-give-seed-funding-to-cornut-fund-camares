Reservoir Capital Group LLC and Saba
Capital Management LP plan to back  Antoine Cornut ’s hedge fund
in its debut next month, according to three people with
knowledge of the matter.  Camares Capital LLP will start March 1 with $100 million to
$200 million, said the people, who asked not to be identified as
the matter isn’t public. It will have a staff of about 10
people, two people said.  Cornut resigned in July from Frankfurt-based  Deutsche Bank
AG , where he led flow-credit trading in the Americas and Europe.
 Askin Aziz  and Julien Marie, both former  Deutsche Bank 
employees, join Cornut at Camares Capital as partners.  Cornut declined to comment. The investments were reported
earlier today by Financial News.  Seeders generally invest $100 million to $150 million in a
hedge fund, providing a pool of capital to help the manager
begin trading. In return, the seeding fund gets 15 percent to 25
percent of the fees. Hedge-fund managers typically charge
clients 2 percent of assets and take 20 percent of investment
gains.  The seed money is often locked up in the hedge fund for
three years, and seeders return initial capital to their
investors after about five years. Seeding funds retain their
ownership stake until it’s bought out by the manager or a third
party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
