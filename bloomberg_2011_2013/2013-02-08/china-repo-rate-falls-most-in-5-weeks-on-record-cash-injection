China’s benchmark money-market rate
fell the most in two months after China pumped in a record 860
billion yuan ($138 billion) into the financial system to meet
cash demand before next week’s holidays.  The People’s Bank of China injected 410 billion yuan using
14-day reverse-repurchase contracts yesterday, after adding 450
billion yuan on Feb. 5. The monetary authority pumped in a net
662 billion yuan into the financial system this week. China’s
financial markets will be shut for a week starting Feb. 11 for
the Lunar New Year break.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, declined 57 basis points, the most since
Dec. 4, to 3.53 percent in Shanghai, according to a weighted
average compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. The
rate rose 20 basis points this week.  “The repo rate is finally showing some signs of
stabilization after a record amount of liquidity injection this
week,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a strategist at Societe Generale
SA in Hong Kong. “We expect the seven-day repo rate to
normalize into the 2.50 percent to 3.50 percent range as the
market reopens” after the holidays, he said.  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, dropped two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.13 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It fell five basis points this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
