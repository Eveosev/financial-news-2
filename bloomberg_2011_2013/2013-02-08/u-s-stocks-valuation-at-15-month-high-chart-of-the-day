(Corrects to show S&P 500 valuation at highest in 18
months in first paragraph.)  The U.S. stock-market rally to an
almost-record high has left the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
trading at the most expensive level in 18 months.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that the price-earnings ratio
for the U.S. equity benchmark has increased 25 percent to 14.9
since October 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s still 10 percent cheaper than the average multiple of
16.6 from the past decade.  “Stocks are fairly valued,”  Donald Selkin , who helps
manage about $3 billion as chief market strategist at National
Securities Corp. in New York, said in a phone interview
yesterday. “As long as interest rates stay low, I don’t think
we’re going to get much multiple expansion.”  The S&P 500 is 3.6 percent below the record 1,565.15
reached in October 2007 after lawmakers agreed on a budget
compromise and companies reported better-than-estimated
earnings. The  gauge  has more than doubled from its 12-year low
in 2009 after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near
zero and increased its balance sheet to a record $3 trillion by
buying Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.  The most  expensive stock in the S&P 500 is online retailer
Amazon.com Inc., which trades at 723 times its earnings,
followed by Netflix Inc. with a ratio of 627, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Seagate Technology Plc, which makes hard disk
drives, and Best Buy Co. are the cheapest, with ratios below
4.6.  About 75 percent of the 341 S&P 500 companies that have
released results so far in the reporting season have exceeded
 profit projections,  and 67 percent have beaten sales estimates,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “You have anemic growth,”  Michael Cuggino , who helps
manage about $17 billion at San Francisco-based Pacific Heights
Asset Management, said in a phone interview. “We may be
reaching a point where we’ve maxed out on the efficiencies and
that sort of effect on profits. We need something that’s going
to spur animal spirits to get the economy moving again.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
