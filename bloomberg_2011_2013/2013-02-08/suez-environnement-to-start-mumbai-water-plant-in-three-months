(Corrects capacity in fourth paragraph.)  Suez Environnement , Europe’s second-
biggest water company, will begin operating a treatment plant in
Mumbai within three months as the country’s growing urban
centers increase consumption.  “Considering India’s population and rising demand for
water, we expect business to grow, especially in mid-sized
cities,” Shyam Bhan, the utility’s chief operating officer in
India, said by telephone from Gurgaon, near New Delhi.  Rapid urbanization has boosted demand for water treatment
in India, where Suez Environnement, larger European competitor
 Veolia Environnement  and  Va Tech Wabag Ltd.  are competing for
contracts. Emerging Asian markets represent growth for Paris-
based Suez which, like peers at home, is grappling with slower
demand for industrial waste collection in Europe after factories
were suspended to survive the economic slowdown.  The 3 billion-rupee ($56 million) Indian project, awarded
by the Mumbai municipality, adds capacity to an existing 2.1
billion-liter-a-day plant at Bhandup in Mumbai. The facility,
operated by Suez’s Degremont India unit since 1981, will expand
to process an extra 1 billion liters a day, becoming the
nation’s single largest treated-drinking-water project, Bhan
said.  India’s demand for clean water may exceed supply by 50
percent by 2030, while pollution is making what’s available
unfit for human, industrial or agricultural consumption,
according to McKinsey & Co. and the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
