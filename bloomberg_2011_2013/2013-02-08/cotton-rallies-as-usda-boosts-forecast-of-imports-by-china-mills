Cotton futures rallied the most in a
week after the U.S. Department of Agriculture boosted its
forecast of imports by China, the world’s largest user.  China will import 14 million bales in the year ending July
31, or 12 increase more than the 12.5 million expected in
January, the USDA said today in a report. A bale of cotton
weighs 480 pounds. Prices that tumbled last year to a 32-month
low have gained 10 percent this year on signs of improved demand
and smaller global crops, including in the U.S.  “Higher Chinese imports mean cheaper stocks in the rest of
the world have become a lot tighter, which is bullish,”  Peter Egli , the director at Chicago-based Plexus Cotton Ltd., said
today by telephone.  Cotton for March delivery rose 1.6 percent to settle at
82.67 cents a pound at 2:30 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, the biggest gain since Jan. 29.  Prices fell 1.9 percent this week through yesterday on
signs of slowing demand for supplies from the U.S., the world’s
largest exporter. Cotton has slumped 62 percent since reaching a
record $2.197 on March 7, 2011.  “The USDA forecasts suggest Chinese import pace will not
fall off, and this is a key supportive factor for old-crop
prices,” analysts at Rabobank including  Luke Chandler  said in
an e-mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
