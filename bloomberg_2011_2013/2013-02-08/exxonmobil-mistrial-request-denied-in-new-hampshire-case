ExxonMobil Corp.â€™s request for a
mistrial in a lawsuit brought by New Hampshire over the gasoline
additive MTBE was denied by the trial judge in Concord,
according to a court filing.  ExxonMobil alleged a witness for the state made comments
about a cleanup fund in front of the jury in violation of a
previous court order.  To contact the reporter on this story:
