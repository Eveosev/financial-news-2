The Canadian dollar fell against the
majority of its most-traded peers before a report forecast to
show job creation slowed even as strong trade data from China
buoyed the currencies of other commodity exporters.  The Canadian currency traded in its tightest range this
year versus the greenback. The economy probably created 5,000
jobs in January, down from a revised 31,200 the month before,
according to a Bloomberg survey of 23 economists. The currency
fell against the Australian and New Zealand dollars, fellow so-
called commodity currencies, after China’s government said
exports gained 25 percent from a year earlier and imports rose
28.8 percent. Crude oil, Canada’s largest export, rose.  “We saw some good data coming out of China, certainly that
boosted risk appetite,” said  Sebastien Galy  a senior foreign-
exchange strategist at Societe Generale SA in New York, in a
telephone interview. “The problem for the Canadian dollar is
expectations are somewhat subdued, people focus a lot on the bad
fundamentals in Canada, mainly the high levels of consumer debt.
That’s an old story that’s come to the fore. The Canadian dollar
has difficulty outperforming when it should outperform.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, was little changed against
its U.S. counterpart at 99.88 cents per U.S. dollar at 7:58 a.m.
in Toronto. One loonie buys $1.0012.  Canadian household debt rose to 165 percent of disposable
income in the third quarter, compared with 163 percent in the
prior three-month period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
