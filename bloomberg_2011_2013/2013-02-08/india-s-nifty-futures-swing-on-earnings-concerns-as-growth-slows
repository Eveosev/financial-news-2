Indian  stock futures swung between
gains and losses amid concern corporate earnings growth may
weaken as the economy expands at the slowest pace in a decade.  SGX S&P CNX Nifty Index futures  for February delivery added
less than 0.1 percent to 5.965 at 10:05 a.m. in Singapore after
dropping as much as 0.9 percent. The underlying S&P CNX  Nifty 
Index fell 0.3 percent to 5,938.80 yesterday. The BSE India
 Sensitive Index , or Sensex, declined 0.3 percent to 19,580.32.
 The Bank  of New York Mellon India ADR Index of U.S.-traded
shares slumped 1.3 percent to the lowest since Jan. 10.  About 30 percent of Sensex companies that have reported
December-quarter  earnings  have missed forecasts, compared with
40 percent in the previous two quarters. India forecast gross
domestic product will expand 5 percent in the year ending March
31, the least since 2003, as subdued investment and one of the
highest inflation levels among major emerging nations add
pressure on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to extend his economic
reform agenda.  “There are no real signs of earnings recovery based on
third-quarter numbers,”  Sanjeev Prasad , senior executive
director of Kotak Institutional Equities, told Bloomberg TV
India yesterday. “Unless and until the reforms process starts
impacting earnings, I don’t think the markets will really
perform.”  Weaker Position  India’s economy is in a weaker position than before the
global financial crisis and the Reserve Bank must refrain from
cutting borrowing costs further until inflation is contained,
the International Monetary Fund said on Feb. 6.  India became the first major Asian economy to ease
borrowing costs in 2013, when the Reserve Bank of India cut its
key  repurchase rate  by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent on Jan.
29, the first reduction since April 2012.  The Sensex has climbed 0.8 percent in 2013, erasing most of
this year’s gains. The gauge trades at 13.6 times  estimated
earnings  for the year ending March 2014, near the highest level
since February 2012. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is valued
at 9.4 times, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The benchmark index jumped 26 percent last year, the most
in three years, as foreign funds bought shares amid government
efforts to reduce subsidies, allow higher foreign investment in
retailing and aviation, and hasten infrastructure projects in a
bid to revive  economic growth .  Overseas funds were net buyers of $252.3 million of Indian
stocks on Feb. 6, extending this year’s net purchases to a net
$5.94 billion. That’s a record for the period, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd .,  Sun Pharmaceutical Industries
Ltd . and  Hindalco Industries Ltd . are among companies scheduled
to post third-quarter earnings today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
