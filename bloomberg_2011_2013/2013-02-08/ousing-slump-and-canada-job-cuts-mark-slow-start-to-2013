Canadian employers unexpectedly cut
jobs in January while home builders slowed the pace of new
construction to the least since 2009, suggesting a languid start
to the new year for the country’s economy.  Employment  fell by 21,900 in January on declines in
manufacturing and education, Statistics Canada reported today.
It also reported exports and imports fell in December.
Separately, Canada’s housing agency reported the annual pace of
home starts plunged 19 percent in January from a month earlier.
 Doug Porter  of BMO Capital Markets said the data marked “a day
of infamy for Canadian economic stats.”  The world’s 11th-largest economy probably had its worst
six-month performance since the end of the 2009 recession in the
second half of last year, as exports declined and concerns about
the global expansion prompted businesses to curb spending,
leading economists and policy makers to scale back their
expectations for 2013. The Bank of Canada, alone among Group of
Seven central banks with a tightening bias, said on Jan. 23 that
the need to raise rates is less urgent.  “Domestically, we’ve had a spate of weaker-than-expected
numbers,” said  Mark Chandler , chief fixed-income strategist at
Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto. “We’re definitely lagging the
improvement we’re seeing elsewhere” in the world.  The Canadian dollar depreciated 0.4 percent to C$1.0020 per
U.S. dollar at 12:02 p.m. in Toronto, weakening through parity.
Canadian 10-year bond yields fell to 1.97 percent from 1.99
percent yesterday.  Trading in overnight index swaps show investors are pricing
in a 1.3 basis point increase in the Bank of Canda’s benchmark
rate by October. That’s down from 9 basis points yesterday.  Weakness Signs  Today’s reports mirror other recent signs of weaknesses.
Canada’s inflation rate was 0.8 percent in December and
November, a three-year low that is beneath the bottom of the
central bank’s target bank for price increases. The Citigroup
 Economic Surprise Index  for Canada fell to its lowest since
Sept. 27 today.  Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney pared his 2013 growth
forecast to 2 percent on Jan. 23 from an  October  prediction of
2.3 percent. The economy will reach full output in the second
half of 2014 instead of the end of 2013, he said, as growth
accelerates to 2.7 percent next year.  Statistics Canada said today full-time employment fell by
20,600 in January and part-time positions by 1,400.  The labor force shrank by 57,500 in January, the largest
drop since April 1995, and the participation rate fell to 66.6
percent from 66.8 percent.  Biggest Losses  The biggest job losses by industry were a 30,900 drop in
education and 21,600 in manufacturing. The losses were partly
offset by gains of 17,100 new jobs in construction and 17,200 in
professional, scientific and technical services.  Private companies cut 18,800 workers and public-sector
employment dropped by 27,000 in January. The federal government
has been reducing its workforce as part of efforts to eliminate
its budget deficit. The data ends a five-month string of job
gains which saw employment increase by 184,000.  “I was more surprised by the resilience of the labor
market and anticipated as we turned to this year the employment
numbers were going to catch up with the rest of the economy,”
said  David Watt , chief economist at HSBC Bank Canada.  Ted Menzies , Canada’s junior finance minister, told
reporters in Calgary today the trend is still strong.  ‘Ups and Downs’  “We’ll see ups and downs, but the overall trajectory is in
the right direction,” Menzies said. “We’re still looking at
the strongest job growth record in all the Group-of-Seven
countries.”  Canada’s statistics agency also reported the country’s
 deficit  narrowed to C$901 million ($900 million) in December
from C$1.67 billion in November. The decline was due to a 2.8
percent drop in imports, which outpaced a 0.9 percent fall in
exports.  Separately, Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp. reported the
annual pace of home starts fell to 160,577 in January, the
slowest since July 2009.  Multiple-unit  starts in urban areas fell 29 percent to
78,816 in January from 110,927 in December. Single-detached home
starts fell 11 percent. Urban housing starts in Ontario plunged
44 percent, and were down 30 percent in Quebec.  “Combined with the steep drop in housing starts as well as
the still-wide trade deficit, the jobs report rounds out a day
of infamy for Canadian economic stats,” Porter, chief economist
at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, said in a note to investors.  “With housing softening notably, and consumers and
governments not in much mood or ability to spend, the economy
will need a major helping hand from a stronger U.S. performance
in the year ahead to help generate renewed job gains,” Porter
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
