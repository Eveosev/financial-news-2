(Corrects spelling of Champaign, Illinois, in second
paragraph.)  Tyler Griffey made a layup with two
seconds remaining to give the University of Illinois a 74-72
victory against top-ranked Indiana University in men’s college
basketball.  Also last night, No. 4 Duke defeated North Carolina State
98-85 in an Atlantic Coast Conference contest.  The Illini rallied from a 41-29 halftime deficit at
Assembly Hall in Champaign, Illinois, to improve to 16-8 and 3-7
in Big Ten Conference play. D.J. Richardson scored 23 points,
Brandon Paul added 21 and Griffey came off the bench to score 14
for Illinois.  Cody Zeller had 14 points and nine rebounds, and reserve
Will Sheehey scored 13 for the Hoosiers, who fell to 20-3 and 8-
2 in the Big Ten.  It’s the fifth straight week that the No. 1 team has lost.
Indiana also lost by two points as the top-ranked team on Dec.
15 to Butler, 88-86 in overtime.  At Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham, North Carolina, Mason
Plumlee scored 30 points, Seth Curry had 26 and Quinn Cook
contributed 21 for the Blue Devils, who had a 58-37 halftime
advantage.  Duke improved to 20-2 overall and 7-2 in the ACC, where it
is second behind Miami (18-3, 9-0 ACC).  Richard Howell tallied 23 points and C.J. Leslie added 16
for the Wolfpack, who fell to 16-7 overall and 5-5 in the ACC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
