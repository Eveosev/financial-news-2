Spain’s bad bank turned down an offer
by three private-equity firms including Cerberus Capital
Management LP to invest in its shares because they sought
preferential terms, a person familiar with the information said.  The decision to turn down the investment proposal by
Cerberus, Centerbridge Partners LP and Fortress Investment Group
LLC had the support of the so-called troika, or European
Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary
Fund, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the information isn’t public.  Spain set up a so-called bad bank known as Sareb under the
terms of a European bailout for its banking system to absorb the
soured real estate assets of nationalized lenders such as the
Bankia group. Sareb, which took on 37 billion euros ($49.4
billion) of assets in December, is seeking an annual return on
equity of as much as 15 percent as it buys foreclosed real
estate at an average discount of 63 percent.  Tim Price , a spokesman for Cerberus, wasn’t immediately
available for comment when contacted by telephone by Bloomberg
News. Officials at Fortress and Centerbridge didn’t immediately
respond to messages.  News of the rebuff was reported earlier today by Spanish
newspaper Expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
