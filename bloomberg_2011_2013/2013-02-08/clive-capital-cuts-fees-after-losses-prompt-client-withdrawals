Clive Capital LLP, Europe’s biggest
commodity hedge fund, will cut its fees after posting two
consecutive years of losses, according to a letter sent to
clients today.  Clive will start charging investors in its class B shares a
2 percent management fee and a 20 percent performance fee from
April, down from 2.5 percent and 25 percent respectively, the
London-based hedge fund said in the letter, which was obtained
by Bloomberg News. The decision comes after client withdrawals
and investment losses prompted assets under management to shrink
46 percent to $1.95 billion.  “As a result of two challenging years for the fund, we
have decided to lower our Class B fees,” Clive said in the
letter. “We are positive about the opportunities in commodity
markets in 2013 and optimistic on performance going forward.”  Elizabeth Holstein , who oversees investor relations at
Clive in London, declined to comment on the fee reduction.  Commodity hedge funds have struggled to make money over the
past two years, whipsawed by announcements by government
officials that spurred price swings in markets from oil to
wheat. Clive, which was founded by former Moore Capital
Management LLC trader  Chris Levett , slumped 8.8 percent last
year after falling 9.9 percent in 2011.  The reduction in fees will bring Clive in line with the
broader hedge-fund industry, which typically charges 2 percent
to oversee client money and 20 percent of any investment gains.  Investors had been willing to pay a premium to Clive after
it outperformed rivals in previous years, gaining 44 percent in
2008, 17 percent in 2009 and 20 percent in 2010. The Newedge
Commodity Trading Index, which tracks the performance of the
biggest commodity hedge funds, fell 7.8 percent in 2008 before
gaining 11 percent in 2009 and 10 percent in 2010.  Clive said it will continue to manage its business
“efficiently” so that the reduced fees won’t affect its
operations, according to the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
