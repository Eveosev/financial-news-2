Westway Group Inc. , a provider of
bulk liquid storage, set the rate it will pay on a $270 million
term loan B to back its buyout by EQT Partners AB, according to
a person with knowledge of the transaction.  The seven-year debt will pay interest at 4 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the information
is private. Libor, a rate banks say they can borrow in dollars
from each other, will have a 1 percent floor.  Westway is proposing to sell the loan at 99 cents on the
dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the company and
boosting the yield to investors.  Lenders are being offered one-year soft-call protection of
101 cents, meaning the company would have to pay 1 cent more
than face value to refinance the debt during the first year, the
person said.  Royal Bank of Canada is arranging the financing, which also
includes a $30 million, five-year revolving line of credit,
according to the person. Investors have until Feb. 20 to let the
bank know whether they will participate in the deal.  EQT Partners purchased the New Orleans-based company for
approximately $266 million, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Thomas Masilla, chief financial officer of Westway Group,
didnâ€™t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
