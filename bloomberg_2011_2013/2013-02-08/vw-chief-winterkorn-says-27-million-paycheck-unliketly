Volkswagen AG  Chief Executive Officer
 Martin Winterkorn , the highest-paid top manager among Germany’s
biggest companies, expects to earn less as the carmaker
considers limiting compensation packages.  Compensation amounting to 20 million euros ($27 million)
would be difficult to explain, and it would be understandable
for the supervisory board to change terms of executives’ pay,
Der Spiegel magazine cited Winterkorn as saying an  interview .
 Michael Brendel , a spokesman at Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW,
confirmed the comments.  Winterkorn  earned  17.5 million euros in 2011, the most of
any CEO of companies on Germany’s benchmark  DAX Index . The IG
Metall labor union called in March for limits on top managers’
pay packages, and  Bernd Osterloh , the top labor representative
at VW, said last year that the supervisory board is considering
revising criteria for salary and benefits.  Winterkorn reiterated that VW, Europe’s biggest carmaker,
is considering producing a budget-priced vehicle, costing 6,000
euros to 7,000 euros, that it would build with one of its
Chinese partners starting in 2015, Spiegel reported.  Working to bring down costs on the vehicle without losing
 Volkswagen ’s quality standards will be very demanding,
Winterkorn said at the Detroit motor show last month.  Volkswagen aims to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions across
its fleet to 95 grams per kilometer by 2020 to comply with
possible European Union environmental standards, Winterkorn
said, according to Spiegel. That would equal fuel consumption of
about four liters of gasoline per 100 kilometers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
