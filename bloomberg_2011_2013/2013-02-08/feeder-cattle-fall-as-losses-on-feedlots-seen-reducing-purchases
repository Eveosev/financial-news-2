Feeder-cattle futures dropped for the
sixth straight session on speculation that demand will slow as
high U.S. feed costs discourage purchases of the animals. Cattle
and hog futures were little changed.  Feedlots , which buy cattle and raise them on mostly grain
until they are fat enough to sell to beef processors, will have
“slightly negative” profit margins in 2013 because of high
feed costs,  Michael Swanson , an agricultural economist at Wells
Fargo & Co., said on Feb. 6. Beef demand is expected to drop 2
percent this year, partly on lower income, Cattlefax said today.  “With the feeders losing money, they’re sick of paying up
for the feeder cattle,”  Lane Broadbent , a vice president at KIS
Futures Inc. in Oklahoma City, said by telephone today. “They
also know there’s going to be some cattle coming in off of
pastures soon.”  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement fell 0.7 percent
to $1.46225 a pound at 10:54 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price through yesterday dropped 1.6 percent this
month.  Cattle futures for April delivery were down 0.1 percent at
$1.3135 a pound on the CME. Hog futures for April settlement
fell 0.1 percent to 86.4 cents a pound in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
