China’s January coal imports rose 56
percent from a year ago, according to data released by the
Beijing-based General Administration of Customs.  China, the world’s biggest energy user, brought in 30.55
million metric tons of coal last month, the customs data showed
today. The country purchased a  record  35.11 million tons from
overseas in December.  China has boosted coal imports as the government shuts
domestic mines to improve safety. Accidents killed 1,973 people
in 2011 and 2,433 in 2010, according to the State Administration
of Work Safety. That compares with 48 deaths in 2010 in the
U.S., the world’s second-biggest coal producer. Regulators will
close about 5,000 mines this year, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported yesterday, citing the safety bureau.  “Recent intensive coal mine accidents are the direct
reason for a boost in imports,” Liu Dongna, a coal analyst with
Shandong-based energy consultancy Chem99, said by phone today.
“This led to a halt of production in major coal mines,
interfering with local supply.”  There have been five accidents in Shanxi Province, two in
Heilongjiang and one in Guizhou as well as one in Southwest
China in January, said Liu.  Today’s data didn’t specify the categories of coal. China
started to include lignite in its customs statistics for the
fuel imports in January 2012.  Stockpiles at Qinhuangdao, China’s biggest port for
transporting coal, rose to 7.89 million tons as of Feb. 3,
according to the China Coal Transport and Distribution
Association. The price of benchmark power-station coal with an
energy value of 5,500 kilocalories per kilogram was at 620 yuan
($99.41) to 630 yuan a ton, unchanged for a sixth week, the
association’s data shows.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
