Honeywell International Inc.  is
evaluating about 100 companies as potential acquisition targets,
with a focus on deals of less than $1 billion because they are
easier to assimilate, Chief Executive Officer  Dave Cote  said.  While the prospects are valued at as much as $20 billion,
Honeywell is unlikely to buy anything that big because it would
risk integration challenges and paying too much, Cote said
yesterday in an interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters office in
New York.  “Stuff over $1 billion, then I start to get queasy,” said
Cote, 60. “I like to  acquire  at a size that we can immediately
Honeywell-ize it.”  Since becoming CEO in 2002, Cote has acquired about 75
companies for $10 billion and sold $6 billion of unwanted
businesses at Honeywell, whose products include thermostats and
aircraft cockpit controls. Having a large pool of potential
takeover targets gives the Morris Township, New Jersey-based
company the discipline to walk away from deals, he said.  Honeywell rose 0.2 percent to $70.53 at 4:02 p.m. in New
York. The shares have gained 11 percent this year,  outpacing  a
6.4 percent increase by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Flawed deal-making, including the merger of Honeywell with
Allied Signal Inc. in 1999 and the purchase of Pittway Corp. in
2000, led to company infighting, Cote said. Honeywell had large
writedowns a decade ago.  “Investors when I first got there used to say, ‘Are you
going to blow the money?’” Cote said. “We’ve gotten to the
point where they say, ‘Geez, you guys are good at capital
deployment and we trust the acquisitions that you do.’”  Honeywell in October completed the purchase of a 70 percent
stake in Thomas Russell Co., a seller of natural gas processing
equipment, for $525 million and announced in December it will
pay about $600 million for Intermec Inc., a maker of handheld
devices used in warehousing and field service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
