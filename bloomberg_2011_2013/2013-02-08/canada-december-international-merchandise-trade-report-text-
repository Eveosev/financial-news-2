The following is the text of
Canada’s international merchandise trade report for December
from Statistics Canada.  Canada’s merchandise imports fell 2.8% in December and
merchandise exports declined 0.9%. As a result, Canada’s trade
deficit with the world decreased from $1.7 billion in November
to $901 million in December.  Volumes largely accounted for the declines in imports and
exports.  Imports fell to $38.5 billion, as volumes decreased 2.7%.
Imports were down in most sections with the largest decrease in
basic and industrial chemical, plastic and rubber products.  Exports declined to $37.6 billion as volumes fell 2.1%,
while prices rose 1.2%. Decreases in exports of energy products
as well as motor vehicles and parts were partly offset by an
increase in metal ores and non-metallic minerals.  Exports to the United States fell 4.0% to $27.6 billion,
mainly on lower exports of motor vehicles and parts. Imports
from the United States decreased 3.3% to $24.1 billion.
Consequently, Canada’s trade surplus with the United States
narrowed from $3.8 billion in November to $3.5 billion in
December.  Exports to countries other than the United States rose 8.5%
to $10.0 billion while imports declined 2.0% to $14.5 billion.
As a result, Canada’s trade deficit with countries other than
the United States decreased from $5.5 billion in November to
$4.4 billion in December.  Widespread declines in import volumes  Imports of basic and industrial chemical, plastic and
rubber products fell 9.7% to $2.9 billion in December, as
widespread declines in volumes occurred throughout the section.
The main contributor to the overall decrease was imports of
lubricants and other petroleum refinery products, which fell
43.8% on lower volumes.  Imports of motor vehicles and parts declined 3.9% to $6.6
billion, as the holiday season plant shutdowns were longer than
in previous years. Motor vehicle engines and motor vehicle parts
fell 8.6% to $2.7 billion, the largest decrease in the section,
as volumes declined 8.0%.  Imports of industrial machinery, equipment and parts
decreased 6.8% to $3.4 billion as volumes were down 6.5%.
Contributing the most to the decline were imports of logging,
mining and construction machinery, which fell 18.9%. This was
the sixth consecutive monthly decrease for this group following
a record high in June.  Metal ores and non-metallic minerals fell 19.0% to $786
million in December, after three consecutive monthly increases.
This decline was led by a 20.5% decrease in imports of metal
ores and concentrates, primarily lead and zinc ores and
concentrates. Overall, volumes of metal ores and non-metallic
minerals declined 18.0%.  An increase in volumes and prices pushed imports of energy
products up 5.1% to $3.8 billion. Crude oil and crude bitumen
was the main contributor to the gain, rising 7.4% to $2.6
billion.  Energy products leads decline in exports  Following four consecutive monthly increases, exports of
energy products fell 6.9% to $8.0 billion in December as volumes
fell 10.0%. Overall, the main contributor to the decline was
crude oil and crude bitumen, followed by natural gas, and other
energy products, primarily coal.  Exports of motor vehicles and parts decreased 6.8% to $5.6
billion, largely the result of lower volumes. Exports of
passenger cars and light trucks, which fell 10.5% to $3.8
billion, accounted for the majority of the decrease.  Exports of metal ores and non-metallic minerals rose 26.3%
to $1.7 billion. Leading the gain were exports of copper ores
and concentrates, as well as potash, the result of higher
volumes.  Metal and non-metallic mineral products increased 7.7% to
$4.6 billion. Gains were widespread throughout the section.
Exports of unwrought precious metals and precious metal alloys
rose 15.3% to $1.5 billion on higher volumes.  Note to readers  Merchandise trade is one component of Canada’s
international balance of payments (BOP), which also includes
trade in services, investment income, current transfers as well
as capital and financial flows.  International merchandise trade data by country are
available on both a BOP and a customs basis for the United
States, Japan and the United Kingdom. Trade data for all other
individual countries are available on a customs basis only. BOP
data are derived from customs data by making adjustments for
factors such as valuation, coverage, timing and residency. These
adjustments are made to conform to the concepts and definitions
of the Canadian System of National Accounts.  Data in this release are on a BOP basis, seasonally
adjusted and in current dollars. Constant dollars are calculated
using the Laspeyres volume formula (2007=100).  For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal
adjustment and identifying economic trends
( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/colc-cel?catno=11-010 -
X201000311141&amp;lang=fra) .  Beginning with the release of the January 2013 reference
month, the Canadian international merchandise trade data will be
made available on average 35 days after the end of the reference
month, 5 days earlier than previously. For further information,
consult the release date calendar
( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/release-diffusion/2013-eng.htm#a6 ) .  Revisions  In general, merchandise trade data are revised on an
ongoing basis for each month of the current year. Current year
revisions are reflected in both the customs and BOP based data.  The previous year’s customs data are revised with the
release of the January and February reference months as well as
on a quarterly basis. The previous two years of customs based
data are revised annually and are released in February with the
December reference month.  The previous year’s BOP based data are revised with the
release of the January, February and March reference months.
Revisions to BOP based data for the previous three years are
released annually in June with the April reference month.  Factors influencing revisions include late receipt of
import and export documentation, incorrect information on
customs forms, replacement of estimates produced for the energy
section with actual figures, changes in classification of
merchandise based on more current information, and changes to
seasonal adjustment factors.  Revised data are available in the appropriate CANSIM tables.  To contact the reporter on this story:
