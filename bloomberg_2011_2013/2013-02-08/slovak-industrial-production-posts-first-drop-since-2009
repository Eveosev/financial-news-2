Slovak  industrial production  fell for
the first time in more than three years in December as carmakers
reduced output.  Output declined 4.4 percent from a year earlier, the first
contraction since October 2009, after increasing 5.2 percent in
November, the Slovak Statistical Office said in Bratislava, the
capital. Production of cars, a key export, dropped 10 percent.  Slovakiaâ€™s export-dependent economy has been hurt by waning
demand from the 17-nation euro area, which the country joined in
2009. The government last month cut its forecast for economic
growth this year to 1.2 percent from previously a estimated 2.1
percent.  The trade  surplus  narrowed to 130.9 million euros ($175.6
million) in December from 315.7 million euros in the previous
month, the statistics office also said today. The full-year
surplus rose to a record 3.64 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
