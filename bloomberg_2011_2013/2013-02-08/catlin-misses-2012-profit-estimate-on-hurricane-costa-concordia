Catlin Group Ltd. , the second-largest
Lloyd’s of London insurer by market value, reported lower-than-
estimated pretax profit for 2012 on claims related to Hurricane
Sandy and the shipwrecked Costa Concordia.  Pretax profit rose to $339 million from $71 million in
2011, which was the most costly year for natural disasters on
record, the Hamilton, Bermuda-based firm said in a statement
today. That missed the median estimate of $383 million of 17
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Catlin increased loss estimates for Hurricane Sandy, which
struck New York and New Jersey in October, by $25 million to
$225 million and for the Costa Concordia cruise ship, which ran
aground off the coast of Italy, by $16 million to $51 million.
As a result, the firm’s return on equity was 11.3 percent for
the year, compared with rival  Beazley Plc ’s 19 percent.  “A somewhat frustrating slippage,”  Eamonn Flanagan , a
Liverpool, England-based analyst at Shore Capital Group Ltd.
with a hold rating on shares, wrote in a note to clients today,
referring to the increased loss estimates. “The shares have had
a terrific run in the past six months, up 20 percent, but to us
they have travelled far enough for now.”  The shares dropped 3.8 percent to 518 pence in London
trading. They have gained 17.5 percent over the past year,
giving the company a market value of about 1.9 billion pounds
($3 billion).  Higher-than-estimated claims from damaged ships were among
the main reasons for the increased loss estimates for Hurricane
Sandy, while the Italian government’s decision to require the
Costa Concordia to be removed whole rather than in parts also
had an impact,  Paul Jardine , Catlin’s chief operating officer,
said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
