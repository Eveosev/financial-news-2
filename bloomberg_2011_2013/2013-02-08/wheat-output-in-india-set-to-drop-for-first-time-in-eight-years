Wheat  output in India, the world’s
second-largest producer, will drop for the first time in eight
years and rice harvest will fall from a record after a below-
average monsoon, the Agriculture Ministry said today.  The wheat harvest may decline to 92.3 million metric tons
in the year ending June 30 from a record 94.9 million tons, the
ministry said in a statement in New Delhi today. That would be
the first drop since 2004-2005. The rice crop may fall 3.3
percent to 101.8 million tons from 105.3 million tons, while
total food grains production will slide 3.5 percent to 250.1
million tons from 259.3 million, it said.  Seven years of record crops have expanded state wheat
stockpiles to about 31 million tons as of Feb. 1, spurring the
government to increase  exports  to empty warehouses for the new
harvest starting March. The drop in output may not alter the
government’s free-export policy, Ramesh Chand, director of the
New Delhi-based National Centre for Agricultural Economics and
Policy Research, said last month.  State reserves of rice and wheat were 66.3 million tons as
of Feb. 1, compared with the government’s requirement of 25
million tons as of Jan. 1, according to the Food Corp. of India.
Exports may reach 10 million tons in the year starting April 1,
according to Chand. The government has allowed shipment of 4.5
million tons by state companies since July. The cabinet may soon
consider additional sales from state stockpiles, Food Minister
K.V. Thomas said yesterday.  Winter Rice  Farmers planted wheat on 29.8 million hectares (73.6
million acres) as of Feb. 1, compared with 29.9 million hectares
a year earlier, according to the farm ministry. Winter-sown rice
was planted on 1.48 million hectares, down from 2.04 million
hectares, it said.  About half of the country’s food grains are sown during the
monsoon and harvested from October, according to the farm
ministry. The grains include rice, corn and lentils. Harvesting
of wheat, the biggest winter-sown crop, usually begins in March.  Monsoon rainfall this year was deficient in parts of
Maharashtra, Karnataka and Gujarat states, reducing rice area
and yield, according to the farm ministry.  Sugar  cane output will drop 7.3 percent to 334.5 million
tons this year, while cotton harvest may fall 4 percent to 33.8
million bales of 170 kilograms each, the ministry said. Oilseed
output, including soybeans and mustard, will be little changed
at 29.5 million tons from 29.8 million in 2011-2012, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
