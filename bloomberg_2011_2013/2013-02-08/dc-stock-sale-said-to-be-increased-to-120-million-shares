A stock sale in TDC A/S has been
increased to 120 million shares from 80 million yesterday,
according to a person close to the offer.  UBS AG, which is managing the sale, has enough demand to
cover the offer, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the deal is private. NTC Holding is the selling
shareholder.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
