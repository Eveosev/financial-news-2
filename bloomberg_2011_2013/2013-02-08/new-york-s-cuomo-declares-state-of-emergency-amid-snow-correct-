(Corrects governor’s first name in first paragraph.)  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo
declared a state of emergency as a powerful snowstorm raked the
East Coast.  Kennedy International Airport in Queens will close due to
the storm at 6 p.m. local time, Cuomo said today in a news
briefing.  New York City subway lines may suspend surface operations
after 8 p.m., said Thomas Prendergast, acting executive director
of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
