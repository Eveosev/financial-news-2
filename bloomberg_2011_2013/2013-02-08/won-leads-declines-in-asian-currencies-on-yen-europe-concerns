Asian currencies fell for a third
week amid concern the yen’s slump will trigger a currency war,
and after the European Central Bank said the euro’s strength
could hamper an economic recovery.  India’s rupee completed its worst week in 2013 after the
government predicted the slowest economic growth in a decade.
Taiwan’s dollar slid to a five-month low and South Korea’s won
pared a weekly gain after the yen’s plunge to the weakest level
since May 2010 fueled speculation policy makers will rein in
exchange rates to support exports. ECB President  Mario Draghi 
said the euro’s rally in January may slow growth and a Bank of
Japan board member said this week more initiatives are needed to
attain its goal of boosting inflation to 2 percent.  “It’s a risk-off situation as we can expect more verbal
warning about the yen-Asia crosses given recent statements in
Japan,” said  Wong Chee Seng , a currency strategist in Kuala
Lumpur at Ambank Group. “Concerns about the euro’s strength and
debt issues in major economies are also back on the radar.”  The rupee weakened 0.6 percent this week to 53.5050 per
dollar in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Taiwan’s dollar slumped 0.3 percent to NT$29.75, the weakest
since Sept. 11. The baht was little changed at 29.79, after
erasing a weekly gain. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index,
which tracks the region’s 10 most-active currencies excluding
the yen, dropped 0.1 percent, a third weekly decline.  India’s Growth  India’s economy will expand 5 percent in the year through
March 31, the Central Statistical Office said Feb 7. The
nation’s current-account deficit widened to a record in the
quarter ended Sept. 30 and its budget shortfall is the widest in
the largest emerging markets.  The economic projection is “raising concerns about how the
government would fund its twin deficits,” analysts at Edelweiss
Financial Advisors Ltd., including Mumbai-based  Vinay Khattar ,
wrote in a research report yesterday.  The won fell 0.7 percent yesterday, the most in a week, to
1,095.80 per dollar. That pared its appreciation in the week to
0.1 percent. Foreign funds pulled 1.9 trillion won ($1.7
billion) from its stock market in January, the most since May.
The government is “all ready” to intervene as the won rallied
17 percent versus the yen in the past three months, South Korean
Finance Minister  Bahk Jae-Wan  said Jan. 23.  “The currency retreated amid concern that the authorities
in countries with high dependence on exports may take actions to
slow gains,” said  Tohru Nishihama , an economist at Dai-ichi
Life Research Institute Inc. in Tokyo.  Yuan Weakens  China’s yuan fell for a third week, losing 0.09 percent
from Feb. 1, to 6.2325 per dollar, according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System. It touched an eight-week low of
6.2417 earlier. Local financial markets close from Feb. 11 for a
weeklong Lunar New Year holiday.  The People’s Bank of China strengthened its central parity
rate at yesterday’s fixing by 0.17 percent, the biggest increase
since Oct. 15. Annual inflation eased to 2 percent in January
from 2.5 percent in December, official data showed yesterday.  Elsewhere, Malaysia’s ringgit rose 0.2 percent to 3.1005
per dollar from Jan. 31, Indonesia’s rupiah gained 0.5 percent
this week to 9,667 and the Philippine peso was up 0.1 percent at
40.677.  To contact the reporter on this story:
