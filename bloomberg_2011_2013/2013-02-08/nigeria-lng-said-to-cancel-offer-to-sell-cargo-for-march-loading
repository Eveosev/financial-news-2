Nigeria LNG late Thursday canceled an
offer to sell a cargo of liquefied natural gas, according to two
people with knowledge of the tender who asked not to be
identified because they arenâ€™t authorized to speak to the media.  The offer for a 140,000 cubic meter cargo loading March 1
to March 3 opened Feb. 4 and would have closed Feb. 11.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc  declared force majeure on gas
supplies to Nigeria LNG as of Feb. 5 after a leak on a pipeline
serving two processing plants, according to a statement from the
company e-mailed today. Force majeure is a clause companies use
when they miss shipments because of circumstances beyond their
control.  To contact the reporter on this story:
