Maria Hoefl-Riesch beat World Cup
leader  Tina Maze  to win the women’s super-combined title at the
world skiing championships in Austria.  Hoefl-Riesch, the reigning Olympic champion, had a time of
2 minutes, 39.92 seconds over two runs on the Streicher course
in Schladming to beat Maze of Slovenia by 0.46 seconds.
Austria’s  Nicole Hosp  finished third, one second off the pace.  Hoefl-Riesch, 28, was tied for fourth place after the
downhill portion of the race, 0.20 seconds behind Maze and
defending champion Anna Fenninger of Austria. The German then
took the lead with a time of 50.71 seconds in the slalom run,
with the co-leaders yet to come.  Fenninger, seeking to become the fifth woman to defend her
world title, didn’t finish after straddling a gate on the top
portion of the course. Maze, who won the super-G world title
three days ago, was then unable to hold a slight lead she built
early in her run and settled for the silver medal.  It’s the second world title for Hoefl-Riesch, who captured
the slalom at the 2009 championships in Italy.  Hosp had the fastest slalom time of 49.93 seconds to move
up from ninth to third place. Austria’s Michaela Kirchgasser,
Kathrin Zettel and  Elisabeth Goergl  took the next three spots.  American Lindsey Vonn, who won the last three super-combined
World Cup titles, badly injured her knee earlier in the week and
will miss the rest of the season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
