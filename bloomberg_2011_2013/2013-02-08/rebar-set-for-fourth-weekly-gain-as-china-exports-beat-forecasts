Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai climbed, poised for a fourth weekly gain, before week-
long Lunar New Year holidays and as China’s exports rose more
than estimated in January.  Rebar for delivery in October, the most-active contract by
volume, rose as much as 0.9 percent at 4,293 yuan ($689) a
metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange and traded at 4,286
yuan at 11:22 a.m. local time. Futures have gained 1.5 percent
this week. The contract for delivery in May, which had the most
open interest, rose 0.2 percent to 4,131 yuan.  Overseas shipments increased 25 percent from a year earlier,
the customs administration said on its website today. That’s
higher than the 17.5 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 33 economists. Imports rose 28.8 percent, leaving a
trade surplus of $29.15 billion.  “Strong economic data fueled expectations for rebar
demand,” Long Qingqing, analyst at Huatai Great Wall Futures
Co., said in a report today.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery was unchanged at $155.10 a
ton yesterday, according to a price index compiled by The Steel
Index Ltd. The average spot  price  for rebar was little changed
at 3,790 yuan a ton on Feb. 6, according to data from Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
