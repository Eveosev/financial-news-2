Argentina’s central bank ordered
foreign exchange brokers in the Electronic Currency Market to
trade no more than $3 million per day, a 70 percent reduction
from current volumes, newspaper Cronista Comercial reported,
citing agents present in the meeting.  Policy makers are seeking to drive trading into the Open
Electronic Market, which can be monitored by central bank
officials in real time, the Buenos Aires-based paper said.  The goal is to have greater control over the supply and
demand of dollars after the bank’s international reserves
dropped about $700 million this year, Cronista said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
