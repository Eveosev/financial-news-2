Azerbaijanâ€™s central  bank  lowered the
benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, a second cut in
about two months, to help stimulate growth beyond the oil
industry where production has fallen.  The Baku-based regulator cut the rate to 4.75 percent
effective Feb. 11, from 5 percent, it said by e-mail today. The
rate was reduced to 5 percent from 5.25 percent on Dec. 10.  The third-largest oil producer in the former Soviet Union
saw crude output decline for a second year in 2012 to 43 million
metric tons. The non-oil economy expanded 9.7 percent last year,
and the government plans to double the share of industries other
than oil and natural gas in the economy in the next 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
