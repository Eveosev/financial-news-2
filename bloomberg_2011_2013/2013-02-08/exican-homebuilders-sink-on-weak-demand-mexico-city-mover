Desarrolladora Homex SAB  and  Sare
Holding SAB  led Mexican homebuilders to their biggest weekly
decline since August as analysts cut fourth-quarter earnings
estimates on signs that sales slowed late last year.  Homex, the largest Mexican homebuilder, fell 1.9 percent to
28.18 pesos at 2:51 p.m. in Mexico City. It was the fourth
straight drop, leaving the stock down 8.7 percent on the week.
Sare plunged 9.1 percent, while  Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos SAB 
fell 6.6 percent and  Corp. Geo SAB  lost 4.9 percent.  Mortgages on new homes from the state-controlled lender
Infonavit declined 33 percent in the fourth quarter from a year
earlier, according to  Javier Gayol , an analyst with Corporativo
GBM SAB. “Those numbers are not promising for the industry,”
he said.  The  Mexico Habita Index , which tracks six homebuilders in
the country, fell 6 percent this week.  Analysts have been cutting their estimates for
homebuilder’s fourth-quarter earnings, said  Carlos Hermosillo  of
Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB in Mexico City. He has a buy rating
on Culiacan-based Homex.  “Investors are looking for signs of improvement in
companies’ results and are learning the results will not be that
good,” Hermosillo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
