Moody’s Investors Service , Standard &
Poor’s and Fitch Ratings are being investigated by the New York
Attorney General over whether they breached a 2008 settlement
with the state, a person familiar with the matter said.  The companies reached an agreement with then Attorney
General  Andrew Cuomo  that required them to adopt changes to
their operations.  Eric Schneiderman , the current attorney
general, is probing whether they complied with the agreement,
said the person, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about
the probe and asked not to be identified.  The U.S. Justice Department and state attorneys general
this week sued S&P, accusing the company of inflating ratings on
mortgage-backed securities during the housing bubble. New York
wasn’t one of the states that sued.  Michael Adler , a Moody’s spokesman, and  Dan Noonan , a Fitch
spokesman, didn’t immediately respond to e-mails yesterday after
regular business hours seeking comment about the New York probe.  Catherine Mathis , a spokeswoman for  McGraw-Hill Cos .’ S&P
unit, declined to comment on the probe.  New York’s investigation was reported yesterday by the Wall
Street Journal.  In the 2008 deal with Cuomo, the companies agreed to change
the way they were paid to rate mortgage-backed securities and to
disclose more information about their process, including whether
an issuer sought, and then decided not to use, ratings from a
certain company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
