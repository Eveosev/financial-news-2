Sasol Ltd. , the world’s largest
producer of motor fuel from coal, said profit for the six months
through December will be affected by a writedown in the value of
its Iranian unit.  Earnings per share will probably decrease by 10 percent to
20 percent compared with a year earlier after the Johannesburg-
based company cut the value of its 50 percent stake in Arya
Sasol Polymers Co. by 1.97 billion rand ($220 million).  “We continue to actively engage with interested parties to
divest from our share in Arya Sasol Polymers Company,” it said.
Sasol co-owns Arya with Pars Petrochemical Co. of Iran, a unit
of National Petrochemical. Arya contributes about 3 percent to
the South African company’s operating profit.  The U.S. and European Union are pressuring Iran to curtail
its nuclear program, which they say is aimed at developing an
atomic weapon. Iran denies it is trying to make atomic weapons,
saying its nuclear research is for civilian use.  To contact the reporter on this story:
