Soybean futures fell the most in
seven weeks after the U.S. government said bigger crops in South
America will boost global inventories before the Northern
Hemisphere harvests. Corn rose.  World  soybean  production will total a record 269.5 million
metric tons, more than the 269.41 million forecast in January,
and up 13 percent from a year ago, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said today in a report. Combined production in
Brazil and Argentina will rise 28 percent to a record 136.5
million, the agency said.  Inventories  on Oct. 1 were estimated
at 60.1 million tons, up from 55.25 million a year earlier.  “There is no shortage of soybeans,”  Dale Durchholz , the
senior market analyst at AgriVisor LLC in Bloomington, Illinois
said in a telephone interview. “‘People are less inclined to
buy with bigger crops projected in South America and rain in the
forecasts for the next week.”  Soybean futures for March delivery tumbled 2 percent to
$14.5675 a bushel at 1:02 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. A
close at that price would mark the biggest drop for a most-
active contract since Dec. 19. The oilseed headed for a weekly
decline, snapping a four-week rally.  Through yesterday, futures gained 21 percent in the past 12
months after the most-severe drought in 70 years cut U.S.
inventories to a nine-year low.  Corn futures for March delivery rose less than 0.1 percent
to $7.11 bushel. The price dropped in the previous five
sessions, the longest slump in eight weeks.  U.S. stockpiles before the next harvest will be 5 percent
larger than forecast a month ago, the government said today.
Worldwide  inventories  on Oct. 1 will be 118.04 million tons, up
from 115.99 million predicted a month earlier.  Corn is the biggest crop, valued at $76.5 billion in 2011,
followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
