The New York Mets have signed right-
handed relief pitcher  Brandon Lyon  to a one-year contract.  The Major League Baseball team did not give financial terms
of the deal today in an e-mailed release announcing the
agreement.  Lyon, 33, was 4-2 with a 3.10 earned run average in 67
games last year with the Houston Astros and Toronto Blue Jays.
It was his first season since undergoing shoulder surgery to
repair tears in his right rotator cuff and labrum.  Lyon has saved at least 20 games twice in his 11-year
career -- with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2008 and the Astros
in 2010. He also has pitched for the Boston Red Sox and Detroit
Tigers.  Frank Francisco, 33, led the Mets with 23 saves last
season.  -- Editor: Rob Gloster  To contact the reporter on this story:
