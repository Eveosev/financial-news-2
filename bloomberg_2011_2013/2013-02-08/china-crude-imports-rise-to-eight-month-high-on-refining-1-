China’s  crude oil imports  rose to the
highest level in eight months in January as refineries boosted
runs amid signs of an economic recovery.  China bought 24.87 million metric tons of crude more than
it exported last month, according to  figures  released on the
website of the Beijing-based General Administration of Customs
today. That’s equivalent to 5.88 million barrels a day, the most
since May, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The nation’s exports of all goods increased 25 percent from
a year earlier, beating the 17.5 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists, the customs data also
showed. China’s major refineries raised their average
utilization rate by 0.48 percentage points to 87.23 percent as
of Jan. 31 from two weeks earlier, Oilchem.net  reported  Feb. 1.
The rate will probably remain in a range of 86 percent to 88
percent this month, Oilchem said.  “Refineries are running at high processing rates, boosting
demand for crude,” Gong Jinshuang, a Beijing-based senior
engineer at China National Petroleum Corp., the nation’s biggest
oil company, said by phone today. “Meanwhile, crude stockpiles
are rather low.”  China’s commercial crude inventories dropped 3.6 percent at
the end of December from a month earlier, Xinhua’s China Oil,
Gas & Petrochemicals newsletter reported Jan. 21. That means
crude supplies, excluding emergency reserves, shrank to 29.15
million tons, the lowest level since March, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The nation’s crude imports last month rose 7.4 percent from
a year ago to 25.15 million tons, today’s data show. That’s up
6.3 percent from December. Overseas sales slid 10 percent from a
year ago to 280,000 tons. China remained a net importer of
refined products with 3.91 million tons of purchases and 2.43
million tons of exports.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
