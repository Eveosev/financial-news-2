Latvian consumer prices advanced less
than analysts forecast in January as communications and clothing
costs fell.  Prices rose 0.6 percent from a year earlier, the slowest
pace in 28 months, compared with a 1.6 percent increase in
December, the  statistics office , based in the capital, Riga,
said today in by e-mail. Thatâ€™s below the 1.2 percent median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of seven economists. Prices fell
0.2 percent from the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
