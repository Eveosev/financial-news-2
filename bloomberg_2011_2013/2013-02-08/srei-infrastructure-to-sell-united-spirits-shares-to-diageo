  Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd. , an
Indian lender to road and power projects, plans to sell shares
of United Spirits Ltd. it got as collateral for lending to
Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. to Diageo Plc.  Diageo on Nov. 9 said it will buy a controlling stake in
United Spirits for $2.04 billion. The maker of Johnny Walker
whiskey said it will acquire 27.4 percent of India’s largest
distiller at 1,440 rupees a share and will make a tender offer
for 26 percent of the balance.  Once the regulators approve the transaction “then we get
our money from Diageo,” Srei Vice Chairman  Sunil Kanoria  said
in an interview on Feb. 7. “We get our money, we go home.”  Srei acquired 4.9 million shares of United Spirits after
buying a 4.4 billion-rupee ($82 million) loan advanced to
grounded carrier Kingfisher Airlines by ICICI Bank Ltd. United
Spirits  shares  have risen 41 percent since Nov. 9 and are
trading 33 percent higher than Diageo’s offer price. Kanoria
didn’t explain why he isn’t selling at the market rate that
values Srei’s stake higher at 9.3 billion rupees.  The Kolkata-based Srei had also lent about 700 million
rupees to Kingfisher, Kanoria said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
