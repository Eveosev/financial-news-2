U.S. corn  stockpiles  before the next
harvest will be 5 percent larger than forecast a month ago, and
more than analysts expected, as demand slows, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said.  Inventories will total 632 million bushels (16.06 million
metric tons) on Aug. 31, up from 602 million forecast in
January and less than 989 million bushels a year earlier, the
USDA said today in a  report . The average estimate of 31
analysts in a Bloomberg survey was 616 million. Corn futures
have plunged 16 percent since reaching a record in August as
global supplies improved and high prices slowed demand for U.S.
exports and ethanol.  Larger inventories may reduce costs for hog processor
 Smithfield Foods Inc.  and poultry producer Sanderson Farms
Inc., which say corn-based animal feed is their biggest
expense. Ethanol producers such as Poet LLC and Archer-Daniels-
Midland Co. may also see lower expenses. Last year, about 41
percent of the crop was used to make fuel, topping the amount
turned into animal feed -- 37 percent -- for a second straight
year.  “Corn demand has slowed, and the USDA consumption
forecast is probably still too high,”  Randy Mittelstaedt , the
director of research for R.J. O’Brien & Associates in Chicago,
said before the report. “Prices will have to fall to improve
margins for livestock and ethanol producers,” especially with
the plentiful supplies of cheaper grains available overseas, he
said.  Futures Rise  Corn futures for March delivery rose 0.2 percent to $7.12
a bushel at 9:23 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. On Feb. 1,
the grain reached $7.4625, the highest since Dec. 7.  U.S. exporters will sell 900 million bushels of corn in
the year that ends Aug. 31, down from 950 million forecast last
month and the lowest since 1972. Last year, exporters shipped
1.543 billion bushels.  Sales  since Sept. 1 are 52 percent
behind a year earlier, USDA data show.  An estimated 4.5 billion bushels will be used to produce
ethanol, unchanged from the January forecast and less than
5.011 billion in the previous year, the USDA said. Feed demand
was forecast at 4.45 billion bushels, also unchanged from a
month ago and down from 4.548 billion a year earlier.  The farm-gate price in the current marketing year will
average $7.20 a bushel, compared with $7.40 estimated a month
ago and $6.22 last year, the USDA said.  World  output  in the crop year that began Oct. 1 will be
854.38 million tons, up from 852.3 million forecast a month ago
and down from 882.47 million last year, the USDA said. Global
consumption is forecast to fall to 867.34 million tons from
879.39 million last year.  Worldwide  inventories  at the end of the marketing year
will be 118.04 million tons, up from 115.99 million predicted a
month ago, and down from 131.01 million a year earlier, the
USDA said. Analysts expected 115.57 million, on average.  To contact the reporter on this story: Jeff Wilson in Chicago
