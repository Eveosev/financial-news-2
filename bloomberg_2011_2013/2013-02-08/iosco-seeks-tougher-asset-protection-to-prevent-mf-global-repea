Banks  and investment companies may
face tougher scrutiny from regulators over how they safeguard
clients’ assets in a bid to prevent any repeat of losses such as
those caused by the bankruptcy of MF Global Holdings Ltd.  Global regulators are seeking to address “risks to client
assets” held by financial intermediaries and how they should be
returned “in default, resolution or insolvency scenarios,” the
International Organization of Securities Commissions, said in a
statement on its  website.   The group, which brings together markets regulators from
more than 100 nations, said it has issued guidance to
authorities on how to enhance their supervision of so-called
financial intermediaries that hold client assets.  MF Global in 2011 filed the eighth-largest U.S. bankruptcy
after getting margin calls and bank demands for money at its
brokerage following its investment in the debt of troubled
European economies. Legal disputes between the U.K. and U.S.
units initially tied up assets worth more than $1 billion and
hindered repayment of the brokerage’s clients and creditors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
