U.S. loan funds recorded their
highest weekly inflow as their streak of gains increased to
eight months, according to Bank of America Corp.  Investors this week added $1.3 billion into funds that
purchase floating-rate debt, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based
bank said in a report yesterday, surpassing the $930 million
record set in the prior week. It marked the 34th straight week
of growth in the asset class, which has resulted in more than
$12 billion of deposits.  The inflows have enabled the busiest start in loans made to
the neediest U.S. companies. The average  yield  of 6.1 percent on
loans was  9 basis points  less than those on U.S. speculative-
grade bonds, after having yielded more than junk debt through
January, JPMorgan Chase & Co. data show.  Private-equity firms from Carlyle Group LP to Bain Capital
Partners LLC obtained $26.7 billion of the debt last month from
non-bank lenders to support takeovers and refinance borrowings,
according to JPMorgan. That’s the most for any January since
2007, when $32 billion of the loans were made.  Leveraged loans are a form of high-risk debt that carries
ratings of less than Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and below
BBB- by Standard & Poor’s. Outflows from U.S. high yield funds
accelerated to $1.3 billion, the most in three months, according
to the Bank of America report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
