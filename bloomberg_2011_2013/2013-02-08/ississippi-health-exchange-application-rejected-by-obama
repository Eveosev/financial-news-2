Mississippi’s application to run its
own health-insurance exchange was denied by the Obama
administration, which cited a dispute between the state’s
insurance commissioner and governor over the federal Affordable
Care Act.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will
reject the application and encourage the state to instead join a
federal partnership for running the exchanges, an agency
official said in an e-mail.  “With a lack of support from your governor and no formal
commitment to coordinate from other state agencies, we do not
see a feasible pathway to conditionally approving a state-based
exchange,”  Gary Cohen , director of the department’s Center for
Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, said in a letter
to Mississippi Insurance Commissioner  Mike Chaney .  Chaney had submitted a bid to build one of the insurance
markets as part of the Affordable Care Act without the support
of Governor  Phil Bryant , who opposes the health law and didn’t
want to help enact it. Chaney and Bryant are both Republicans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
