Rubber futures in Tokyo declined for
a second day, paring a second weekly advance, on concern that
stockpiles in China, the largest consumer, may increase.  The contract for delivery in July dropped as much as 1.2
percent to 328.9 yen a kilogram ($3,516 a metric ton) before
trading at 331 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange at 11:21 a.m.
Futures have gained 2.3 percent this week, the ninth advance in
10 weeks, and are up 9.4 percent this year.  Stockpiles  monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose
0.8 percent to 98,814 tons last week, nearing an almost three-
year high reached in January, data from the bourse showed. The
figure will be updated today. Inventories may climb further as
China’s raw-material purchases slowed before holidays next week,
said  Hideshi Matsunaga , an analyst at broker ACE Koeki Co.  “A slowdown in Chinese buying has put a brake on rubber
prices,” Matsunaga said by phone today in Tokyo.  China’s markets are closed next week for the Lunar New Year
holiday. Imports by members of the Association of Natural Rubber
Producing Countries, representing 57 percent of global demand,
may drop 16 percent in February, the group said in a monthly
report. Key members include China, India and Malaysia.  On the Shanghai Futures Exchange, rubber for delivery in
September added 0.4 percent to 27,140 yuan ($4,355) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board dropped 0.8 percent to 98.65 baht ($3.31) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the country’s Rubber Research
Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
