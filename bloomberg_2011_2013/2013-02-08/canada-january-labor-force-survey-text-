Following is the text of Canada’s
labor force survey released by Statistics Canada.  Following two months of gains, employment decreased
slightly in January (-22,000). A decline in the number of people
looking for work pushed the unemployment rate down 0.1
percentage points to 7.0%.  Compared with 12 months earlier, employment increased by
1.6% or 286,000, all in full-time work. Over the same period,
the total number of hours worked rose 1.7%.  In January, employment declined in Ontario and British
Columbia. At the same time, there were increases in Alberta,
Saskatchewan and New Brunswick.  Public sector employment fell by 27,000 in January, while
self-employment was up slightly and the number of private sector
employees was little changed. Compared with 12 months earlier,
the number of private sector employees increased by 1.9% or
210,000, while the number of public sector employees and self-
employed was little changed.  There were fewer workers in educational services and
manufacturing in January, while employment rose in construction
and public administration.  After gains in recent months, employment among men aged 25
to 54 declined in January. Employment rose among men aged 55 and
over and edged up among youths.  Employment down in Ontario and British Columbia  Following two months of increases, employment in Ontario
declined by 31,000 in January, all in full-time work. With fewer
people searching for work, the unemployment rate fell 0.2
percentage points to 7.7%. On a year-over-year basis, employment
in the province was up 1.2%.  Employment in British Columbia fell by 16,000 in January,
and the unemployment rate was 6.3%. With this decline,
employment in the province returned to a level similar to that
of 12 months earlier.  In Alberta, the number of workers increased by 9,700 in
January. However, the unemployment rate remained at 4.5% as more
people participated in the labour force. Compared with 12 months
earlier, employment in the province was up 1.9%.  Employment in Saskatchewan increased for the second
consecutive month, up 7,300 in January. With this gain, the
unemployment rate declined 0.6 percentage points to 4.0%, the
lowest among the provinces and lowest in Saskatchewan since
November 2008. On a year-over-year basis, employment in the
province rose by 4.1%, the highest growth in the country.  Employment rose by 2,700 in New Brunswick in January. At
the same time, the number of people searching for work increased,
pushing the unemployment rate up 0.5 percentage points to 11.3%.
Compared with 12 months earlier, employment in the province
declined by 1.4%.  Employment in Quebec remained little changed for the second
consecutive month, and the unemployment rate was 7.1%. Over the
12 months to January, employment increased by 3.3%.  Industry perspective  In January, employment in educational services declined by
31,000. Despite this loss, employment in the industry was up
3.7% from 12 months earlier.  In manufacturing, the number of workers was down 22,000,
bringing employment in the industry back to a level similar to
that of 12 months earlier.  The number of construction workers increased for the second
consecutive month, up 17,000 in January. With this increase,
year-over-year employment gains were 2.6% for the industry.  Employment in public administration rose 15,000, offsetting
a decline in the previous month. Compared with 12 months earlier,
employment in the industry was little changed.  Employment down among people aged 25 to 54  Following gains over the previous four months, employment
in January declined by 58,000 among people aged 25 to 54 (core-
age group), predominantly men. Compared with 12 months earlier,
employment among people of core working-age rose 0.9%.  In January, employment increased by 22,000 among people
aged 55 and over, mostly men. Year-over-year employment gains
for people aged 55 and over were 5.2%, partly a result of
population ageing.  Employment edged up among youths aged 15 to 24. The
unemployment rate for this group fell 0.6 percentage points to
13.5%.  Note to readers  Each year, the Labour Force Survey (LFS) revises its
estimates for the previous three years, using the latest
seasonal factors. These revised estimates became available in
CANSIM on February 1, 2013 (tables 282-0087 to 282-0089, 282-
0092 to 282-0094, 282-0100, 282-0116 and 282-0117).  The LFS estimates are based on a sample and are therefore
subject to sampling variability. As a result, monthly estimates
will show more variability than trends observed over longer time
periods. Estimates for smaller geographic areas or industries
also have more variability. For an explanation of sampling
variability of estimates and how to use standard errors to
assess this variability, consult the ‘Estimates quality’ section
of the publication Labour Force Information (71-001-X).  The employment rate is the number of employed persons as a
percentage of the population 15 years of age and over. The rate
for a particular group (for example, youth aged 15 to 24) is the
number employed in that group as a percentage of the population
for that group.  The unemployment rate is the number unemployed as a
percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed).  The participation rate is the number of employed and
unemployed as a percentage of the population. For more detailed
information, see the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (71-543-G).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally
adjusted estimates, which facilitates comparisons by removing
the effects of seasonal variations. For more information on
seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal adjustment and identifying
