Brent crude surged to a nine-month
high in London while oil in New York slipped after stronger-
than-expected trade data from China signaled increased fuel
demand in the world’s second-biggest consuming country.  The European benchmark grade’s premium to West Texas
Intermediate oil in New York strengthened for an eighth day.
China’s exports rose 25 percent in January from a year earlier
and  crude imports  increased to an eight-month high, customs
figures showed.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  said oil markets will
“remain tight” in the first quarter and may push prices above
its forecasts.  “Speculation that physical markets in Asia are tight and
will get tighter is having a much bigger impact on Brent than
WTI,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at
Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “The strong oil
import data out of China was very supportive.”  Brent oil for March settlement rose $1.66, or 1.4 percent,
to end the session at $118.90 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange, the highest closing price since May 1.
The volume of all futures traded was 38 percent higher than the
100-day average.  WTI crude oil for March delivery dropped 11 cents to settle
at $95.72 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Volume
was 31 percent more than the 100-day average. The contract fell
2.1 percent this week, after advancing 14 percent over the
previous eight.  Widening Spread  The European benchmark grade’s premium to WTI strengthened
to $23.17, the most since Nov. 26. The Brent-WTI spread has
widened since Enterprise Product Partners LP said Jan. 31 that
capacity will be limited until late 2013 on its Seaway pipeline
to the Gulf Coast from Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for
the New York contract.  “The WTI-Brent spread has widened every day since the
Enterprise announcement,” Armstrong said. “The spread had been
shrinking on speculation that Seaway would be operating at full
capacity but now those bets have to be wound down.”  Brent’s gain has been driven by improving fundamentals not
an increasing risk premium,  Stefan Wieler , an analyst at Goldman
Sachs in New York, said in a report dated yesterday. Prices may
exceed the bank’s forecasts, which for Brent futures are at $110
a barrel for the next three to six months, and at $105 in 12
months. For WTI, Goldman projects a level of $102.50 in three
months, $105 in six and $97 in 12 months.  Chinese Imports  China bought 24.87 million metric tons of crude more than
it exported last month, data published today on the website of
the Beijing-based General Administration of Customs showed.
That’s equivalent to 5.88 million barrels a day, the most since
May, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  U.S.  crude inventories  gained 2.62 million barrels to 371.7
million last week, the Energy Information Administration said
Feb. 6.  Production  advanced 4,000 barrels a day to 7 million in
the week ended Feb. 1, 21 percent higher than a year earlier.  “Brent is the more dynamic market right now because the
U.S. remains very well supplied,” said  Tim Evans , an energy
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York.  Record fuel exports helped shrink the U.S. trade deficit to
a two-year low as America moves closer to achieving energy  self-
sufficiency . The  gap  shrank 20.7 percent to $38.5 billion, the
least since January 2010, the Commerce Department said today.
The jump in petroleum exports came as the number of imported
crude barrels fell to the lowest in almost 16 years.  ‘Abundant’ Supply  “The Brent-WTI spread should drop soon because abundant
U.S. supply is finding its way onto the world market,” Evans
said. “U.S. crude imports fell to the lowest level since 1997,
which is making additional barrels available elsewhere. Fuel
exports are surging, another way the U.S. abundance is being
shared.”  U.S. fuel prices advanced more than WTI on speculation that
a snowstorm in the Northeast will boost heating oil use. This
sent refinery profit margins, as expressed by the so-called
 crack spread , rising to the highest level in almost four months.  The gain from processing three barrels of crude into two of
gasoline and one of heating oil, based on New York futures
settlement prices, increased $2.3038 to $35.264 a barrel, the
highest level since October.  Heating oil for March delivery increased 3.89 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $3.2384 a gallon, the highest settlement since Oct.
11. Gasoline for March delivery advanced 5.89 cents, or 2
percent, to $3.0588, the highest close since Sept. 28.  Price Outlook  WTI may fall next week as technical indicators signal that
prices rose too quickly, a Bloomberg survey showed. Eighteen of
37 analysts and traders, or 49 percent, forecast crude will
decline. Twelve respondents, or 32 percent, predicted an
increase and seven forecast little change.  The relative-strength index of front-month oil futures rose
above 74 at settlement on Jan. 30, the highest level since Feb.
24, 2012. The RSI was at 55 today.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 608,627
contracts as of 3:29 p.m. It totaled 770,907 contracts
yesterday, 48 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.62 million, the highest since Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
