Midlevel  San Bernardino , California,
officials asked a judge to let them sue the insolvent city,
claiming it is abusing federal bankruptcy rules to bypass labor
laws and force concessions on workers.  The union representing about 54 public employees claims the
city made a token attempt to negotiate before imposing cuts to
the workers’ pension and other changes to their labor contract.  “The city has engaged in surface bargaining by ‘going
through the motions’” the San Bernardino Public Employees
Association said today in court papers filed in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Riverside, California. The group asked the judge
overseeing the city’s bankruptcy to allow it to file a case
against the city with the Public Employment Relations Board.  The union represents mid-management city workers.  San Bernardino, a city of about 213,000 people about
60 miles (97 kilometers) east of Los Angeles, filed bankruptcy
on Aug. 1. Since then it has fought with its unions to cut costs
and with the California Public Employees’ Retirement System to
reduce pension payments.  The city says it’s so strapped for cash that it must put
off $13 million in payments to Calpers or risk public safety.  The case is In re San Bernardino, 12-28006, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Central District of California (Riverside).  To contact the reporter on this story:
