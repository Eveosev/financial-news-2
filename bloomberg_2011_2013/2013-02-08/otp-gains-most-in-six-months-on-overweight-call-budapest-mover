OTP Bank Nyrt. , Hungary’s largest
lender, advanced the most in more than six months after Morgan
Stanley raised its recommendation to overweight from equal
weight.  Morgan Stanley increased its price target for the stock by
26 percent to 5,400 forint,  Magdalena Stoklosa  and  Samuel Goodacre , London-based analysts at the bank, wrote in a research
report yesterday. The shares rose 4.2 percent to 4,671 forint at
the close in Budapest, the biggest jump since Aug. 6. The
benchmark BUX stock index fell 0.4 percent.  Narrowing credit risk in Hungary and Bulgaria is helping to
support OTP’s  return on equity , the Morgan Stanley analysts
wrote. The cost of insuring against default on Hungary’s debt
with credit-default swaps has fallen to 296 basis points from a
record 753 in January 2012. OTP’s shares rose 29 percent last
year following a 36 percent plunge in 2011.  “After last year’s share price performance, which was so
sensitive to narrowing Hungarian sovereign risk, we now see
return on equity expansion over the next three years,” the
Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.  OTP will see “low single-digit” growth in lending in 2013
as bad loan provisions decline and economies in central and
eastern Europe “marginally” improve, Chief Financial Officer
Laszlo Bencsik said in an interview on Nov. 15 when the bank
posted a 21 percent jump in third-quarter  net income . OTP is due
to publish fourth-quarter results next month.  “Our analysis points to the flow of new non-performing
loans stabilizing, even declining” in the retail market, the
Morgan Stanley analysts said. “Despite near-term pressure, we
expect OTP’s operating margin to expand in 2014-15.”  The CDS contracts for Bulgaria, where OTP operates its DSK
subsidiary, fell to 105 basis points from 445 in November 2011
and as high as 714 in 2009.  OTP may turn into “one of the most interesting stories”
in banks in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the analysts
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
