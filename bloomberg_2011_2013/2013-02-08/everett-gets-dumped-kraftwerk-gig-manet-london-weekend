The cops are at the door, and all
 Rupert Everett  can think of is the lobster plate the butler just
carted in.  “I have always had a low opinion of what is called action,”
sighs Everett, perfectly cast as  Oscar Wilde  in “Judas Kiss” (by
 David Hare ), which shows the before-and-after of Wilde’s
imprisonment for gross indecency. Despite the low-budget sets
and costumes, and Everett’s ill-fitting fat suit, the play is on
every critic’s current recommendation list.  A high point takes place in Naples, where Wilde walks in on
Bosie (Freddie Fox) and a naked Italian who, he’s told, is
called Galileo. “Ah!” comes the reply. “See stars, did you?”  At Duke of York’s Theatre, St. Martin’s Lane, WC2N 4BG.

can see her fully clothed and looking much more demure in a
blockbuster show at the Royal Academy.  “Manet: Portraying Life” is an intriguing look at the
artist’s habit of making friends and family pose as if they were
strangers on a Paris boulevard.  “Olympia” model Victorine Meurent alternates as a street
singer and a little girl’s chaperone. Young Leon, possibly
Manet’s own son, blows bubbles in one picture and leans
languidly on a lunch table in another.  Through April 14 at the Royal Academy, Burlington House,
Piccadilly, W1J 0BD. Information:  http://www.royalacademy.org.uk 
or +44-20-7300-8000.  Nopi, an all-day restaurant near the Royal Academy, is
popular for its small plates of healthy food. Executive chef
Yotam Ottolenghi also serves a pre-theater menu costing 21.50
pounds ($33.68), or 25.50 pounds with dessert. Information:

fire rhymes, two albums and one film. Ben Drew’s manic tour of
Britain brings him to the O2 for his biggest show yet, featuring
songs from the “Ill Manors” soundtrack.  O2, Peninsula Sq., SE10 0DX. Information: +44-20-8463-2000

a week of concerts featuring its albums in full. Today is
devoted to “Radio-Activity;” tomorrow has “Trans Europe
Express.” Score tickets if you can or beg friends: the shows --
also heard in New York last year and Germany last month -- sold
out fast and have prices of about 200 pounds online.

71, stars in a Sotheby’s preview show where you can also see
works by  Andy Warhol ,  Gerhard Richter , and  Jean-Michel Basquiat .
