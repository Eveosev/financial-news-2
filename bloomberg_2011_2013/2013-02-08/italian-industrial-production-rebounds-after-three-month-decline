Italian industrial  output  rose more
than forecast in December for the first time in four months.  Output increased 0.4 percent from November, when it dropped
a revised 1.1 percent and fell 2.2 percent in the three months
through December, national statistics office  Istat  said in Rome
today. Economists forecast a monthly rise of 0.3 percent,
according to the median of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Italy is mired in its fourth recession since 2001 as Prime
Minister  Mario Monti ’s efforts to contain the budget deficit
curbed domestic demand. Unemployment was at the highest in more
than 13 years in December and consumer confidence fell in
January to the lowest level since at least 1996. Both the
government and the central bank expect a return to economic
growth in the second half of 2013 as export gain.  On Jan. 28, business lobby Confindustria forecast that the
country’s gross domestic product declined “at least 0.6
percent” in the final three months of 2012. Istat will release
its preliminary report on fourth quarter gross domestic product
on Feb. 14.  The monthly increase in industrial output was led by gains
in production of chemical products and transport vehicles,
today’s report showed. Output fell an annual 6.6 percent on a
workday-adjusted basis, Istat said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
