CBOE Holdings Inc . said it’s in
settlement talks over a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
investigation and has set aside $5 million to cover the
resolution.  The biggest U.S. options market by volume said a year ago
that regulators were probing whether the company complied with
its obligations as a self-regulatory organization. American
exchanges are required to write rules for their markets, monitor
trading and seek to ensure that they and their customers aren’t
breaking securities laws.  “We’re engaged in ongoing settlement discussions with the
SEC staff on the resolution of this matter,” Chief Financial
Officer  Alan Dean  said on a conference call with analysts.  “No
agreement has been reached.”  John Nester , a SEC spokesman declined to comment.  Gail Osten , a spokeswoman for CBOE, declined to provide more
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
