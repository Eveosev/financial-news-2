Ex- Jefferies & Co.  managing director
 Jesse C. Litvak  will go on trial April 1 on charges that he
defrauded customers of more than $2 million on trades of
residential mortgage-backed securities.  Litvak, 38, of New York, was arrested Jan. 28 and charged
with 16 counts including securities fraud, fraud connected with
the Troubled Asset Relief Program and making false statements to
the federal government.  Alleged victims include “numerous” investment funds,
among them six established by the U.S. Treasury Department in
2009 as part of its response to the financial crisis, according
to Connecticut U.S. Attorney  David Fein . Litvak, who has also
been sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, is
also accused of defrauding private investment funds.  Jury selection in the case is scheduled to begin at 8:30
a.m. before U.S. District Judge  Janet C. Hall  in New Haven,
Connecticut, according to a Feb. 6 court filing. Litvak pleaded
not guilty and is free on $1 million bond. He faces as much as
20 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charges.  The criminal case is USA v. Litvak, 3:13-cr-00019-JCH-1,
and the civil case is SEC v. Litvak, 13-132, U.S. District
Court, District of Connecticut (New Haven).  To contact the reporters on this story:
