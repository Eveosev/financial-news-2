South Korea’s fell the most in a week
after the European Central Bank said the euro’s strength could
hamper an economic recovery, deterring risk-taking.  ECB President Mario Draghi said yesterday recent currency
gains may slow inflation and economic growth after the euro
strengthened almost 3 percent against the dollar in January.
European Union leaders meet today to consider a 2014-2020
spending ceiling of 960 billion euros ($1.3 trillion), down from
an original proposal of 1.047 trillion euros.  “The won is under the selling pressure as Draghi’s
comments damp sentiment,” said  Jeon Seung Ji , a Seoul-based
currency analyst at Samsung Futures Inc. “Losses may be
countered by some banks converting the dollar into the local
currency ahead of the Lunar New Year.”  The won weakened 0.7 percent to 1,095.80 per dollar in
Seoul, paring this week’s advance to 0.1 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. South Korea’s financial markets will
be shut on Feb. 11 for the Lunar New Year holiday. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange
rates used to price options, fell one basis point to 7.78
percent.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due September
2017 dropped five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, this
week to 2.85 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. The rate
added one basis point today. The one-year interest-rate swap was
at 2.74 percent, unchanged from yesterday and down three basis
points from a week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
