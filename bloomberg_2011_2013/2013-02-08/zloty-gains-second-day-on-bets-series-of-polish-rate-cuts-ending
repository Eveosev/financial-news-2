The zloty strengthened for a second
day on speculation the Polish central bank is close to ending
its cycle of interest-rate cuts.  Traders pushed the currency toward its highest level in a
week as central bank Governor  Marek Belka ’s said on Feb. 6
policy makers will have to “reconsider what we’ve done so far”
at next month’s meeting after four reductions since November.
“All options are open,” he said on the same day. Investor
expectations for further easing fell to their lowest level in
almost eight months, according to interest-rate derivatives data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The switch to a more moderate bias toward further cuts in
the coming months is helping support the zloty,” Jaroslaw
Kosaty, an analyst at PKO Bank Polski SA, Poland’s biggest
lender, said in an e-mailed note today.  The zloty gained 0.2 percent to 4.1649 per euro at 11:24
a.m. in Warsaw.  Twelve-month forward rate agreements traded 57 basis points
below Warsaw Interbank Offered Rate, the smallest gap since June
20, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on 10-year notes fell two basis points to 3.98
percent, paring this week’s increase to nine basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
