Lithuania’s trade deficit narrowed to
the smallest since 2009 last year as exports to Russia surged
and the U.K. imported 80 percent more fuel, food and furniture
from the Baltic nation.  The gap shrank by a quarter to 6.9 billion litai ($2.7
billion), falling to its lowest monthly level since 1995 in
December, the statistics office in the capital, Vilnius, said
today on its website. Exports grew 14.5 percent to 79.6 billion
litai, while imports rose 9.9 percent to 86.6 billion litai, it
said.  Sales to Russia helped Lithuania’s economy grow 3.6 percent
last year as the debt-ridden euro area slipped into recession.
Russia’s share of Lithuanian exports was 18.9 percent in 2012,
up from 16.6 percent in 2011, while the U.K. rose from eighth
place to fifth among Lithuanian export destinations after
Russia, Latvia, Estonia and Germany, the statistics office said.  A quarter of U.K. imports from Lithuania are oil products
from PKN Orlen’s Lithuanian refinery, according to the  website 
of the British Chamber of Commerce in Vilnius. The rest are
fertilizers, furniture and food, such as the  Zemaitijos Pienas 
Pik-Nik brand cheese sticks sold at supermarket chains including
Tesco Plc and J Sainsbury Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
