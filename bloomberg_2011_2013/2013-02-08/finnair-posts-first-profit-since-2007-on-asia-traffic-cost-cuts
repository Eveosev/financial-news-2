Finnair Oyj  snapped a four-year run
of annual losses in 2012 as it boosted ticket sales between
western Europe and Asia via its Helsinki hub while trimming
wage, maintenance and fleet expenses more than anticipated.  The Vantaa-based airline posted net income of 11.8 million
euros ($16 million), versus an 87.5 million-euro year-earlier
loss, it said today in a statement. Earnings were aided by 100
million euros of savings, 25 percent higher than targeted.  Finnair is building its home base into a hub for travel to
Japan, South Korea and China, where it began flying to Chongqing
in Sichuan province in 2012 and will add Shiyan in neighboring
Hubei this year, together with Hanoi in Vietnam. The carrier has
been struggling to post a profit as sluggish European economies
and competition from low-cost carriers including  Norwegian Air
Shuttle AS  squeeze margins on its short-haul operations.  “We’ve been able to increase our business and market share
with Europe and Asia,” Chief Executive Officer  Mika Vehvilaeinen , who is leaving after three years in the job on
Feb. 28, said in a phone interview. “There’s still room for
improved efficiency. The aim is to question existing practices
and to rethink in what ways we could improve our profitability.”  Finnair is seeking to pare expenses by a total of 140
million euros through the end of this year and 200 million euros
by the end of 2014 as part of a program that it began in 2011.  The member of the British Airways-led Oneworld alliance
boosted its passenger total 9.5 percent to 8.77 million people
in 2012 as sales rose 8.5 percent to 2.45 billion euros. It flew
683,600 people in January, 7.2 percent more than a year earlier.  Finnair said Jan. 28 that Vehvilaeinen was leaving to
become CEO of Helsinki-based crane and forklift manufacturer
Cargotec Oyj. The carrier appointed Chief Operating Officer
 Ville Iho  as interim chief until a successor is appointed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
