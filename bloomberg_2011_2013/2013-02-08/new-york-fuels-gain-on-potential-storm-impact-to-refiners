New York Harbor fuels strengthened
versus futures on speculation a winter storm on the U.S. East
Coast may slow refinery and terminal operations, and increase
demand for distillates.  The winter storm, which has caused at least 4,000 U.S.
flights to be canceled, may leave thousands without power and
will probably drop snow by the foot across the Northeast,
according to the National Weather Service and FlightAware.com.
Blizzard warnings stretched from Maine to New Jersey, and winter
storm advisories reached south to Virginia and west to Michigan.  “There’s concern that the storm might impact refinery
operations in the Northeast,” said  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Reformulated,  84-octane gasoline , or RBOB, in the New York
Harbor, strengthened 0.25 cent to 4 cents a gallon below futures
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:25 p.m.  Ultra-low-
sulfur  diesel in the region advanced 0.25 cent to trade at a
premium of 6.63 cents versus heating oil futures.  New Jersey refineries including  Phillips 66 ’s  238,000-
barrel-a-day  Bayway refinery and Hess Corp.’s 70,000-barrel-a-
day  Port Reading plant  are monitoring storm conditions, the
companies said today. No restrictions on traffic have been put
on ports in New Jersey or New York, according to the Coast
Guard.  Supplies of the motor fuel in the  Central Atlantic  region
including the New York Harbor rose to 32.4 million last week,
while distillate  stockpiles  slipped to 23.5 million, the Energy
Information Administration reported. Distillates include diesel
fuel and heating oil.  Refinery Margins  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York, based on Brent oil in
Europe, rose $1.1324 to $12.4174 a barrel. The 3-2-1 spread on
the U.S.  Gulf Coast , measured using West Texas Intermediate in
Cushing, Oklahoma, gained $2.697 to $30.477 a barrel, while the
same spread for Light Louisiana Sweet oil increased $1.3297 to
$8.7924 a barrel.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline on the Gulf strengthened
1.75 cents to 15.5 cents below futures. Ultra-low sulfur diesel
in the region advanced 0.12 cent to 2.5 cents above heating oil
futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
