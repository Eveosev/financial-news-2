Brazilâ€™s real erased its gain and
declined after the central bank said it would auction 37,000
reverse currency swaps.  The real earlier rallied as much as 0.8 percent after
Finance Minister Guido Mantega said in an interview with Reuters
that the government will intervene to stop gains if the currency
reaches 1.85 per dollar, a level last seen in April.  The real fell 0.2 percent to 1.9704 per dollar at 11:45
a.m. in Sao Paulo. Swap rates due in January 2015 rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.21 percent.  The central bank said in a statement that it will release
results of its auction after 11:55 a.m. in Sao Paulo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
