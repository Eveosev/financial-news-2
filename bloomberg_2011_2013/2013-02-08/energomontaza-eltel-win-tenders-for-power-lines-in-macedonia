Energomontaza AD , a Serbian builder
of power lines, said it won two contracts with Macedonia’s
national grid operator worth 13.5 million euros ($18 million) in
projects backed by the World Bank.  The Belgrade-based company, part of  Kodar Group , will
develop a 400-kilovolt line between the central Macedonian city
of Stip and the Serbian border, and a 100-kilovolt line from the
capital Skopje to Tetovo in the northwest, Energomontaza said in
an-emailed statement today.  The “turn-key contracts” were signed with Mepso AD,
Macedonia’s state-owned grid operator, together with project
partners including a unit of Finland’s  Eltel Group Oy  and
Belgrade-based Montprojekt DOO, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
