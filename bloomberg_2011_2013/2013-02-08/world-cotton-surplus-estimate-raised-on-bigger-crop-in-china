Global cotton inventories at the
end of the marketing year will be 0.2 percent higher than
forecast a month ago, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
said.  Stockpiles as of July 31 will total 81.86 million
bales, up from the January estimate of 81.72 million, the
USDA said today in a report. World production will be
118.95 million bales, up from 118.83 million projected last
month. Global use during the year will be 106.24 million
bales, up from 106.06 million forecast last month, the
department said.  The agency raised its output estimate for China, the
world’s largest grower, to 34 million bales from 33.5
million. The forecast for the nation’s imports was raised
12 percent, to 14 million bales from 12.5 million last
month. China’s inventories will be 42.61 million bales at
the end of the season, up 4.9 percent from 40.61 million
estimated in January, the USDA said.  The U.S. crop was 17.01 million bales in the harvest
that started late last year, unchanged from last month’s
forecast, the USDA said. The average estimate of nine
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News was 17 million. The
previous crop was 15.57 million bales, each weighing 480
pounds, or 218 kilograms.  U.S. growers will export 12.5 million bales in the
marketing year that began Aug. 1, up 2.5 percent from 12.2
million estimated in January. Shipments reached 11.71
million in the previous 12 months, the USDA said.  Unsold supplies at the end of the year will reach 4.5
million bales, down 6.3 percent from 4.8 million projected
in January, according to the report. A year earlier, the
surplus totaled 3.35 million bales. Yields in the U.S.
averaged 866 pounds per acre, unchanged from last month,
the USDA said. The figure was 790 pounds in the previous
crop.  The agency previously reduced estimates after farmers
in Texas, the country’s biggest grower, abandoned crops
because of drought.  Through yesterday, cotton has slumped 63 percent since
reaching a record $2.197 a pound on March 7, 2012, as the
high prices encouraged growers to boost production, while
the slowing global economy eroded demand. The fiber for
March delivery fell 0.3 percent to 81.15 cents at 8:25 a.m.
