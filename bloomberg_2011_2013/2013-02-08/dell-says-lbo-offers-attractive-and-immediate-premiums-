Dell Inc.  responded to its biggest
outside shareholder by arguing that its leveraged buyout deal
offers shareholders “an attractive and immediate premium,”
after Southeastern Asset Management Inc. said the proposal
undervalued the personal-computer maker.  The $13.65-a-share buyout offer by Chief Executive Officer
 Michael Dell  and private equity firm Silver Lake Management LLC
“shifts the risks facing the business to the buyer group” and
is “in the best interests of stockholders,”  David Frink , a
spokesman for Dell, said in an e-mail.  “In the course of its deliberations, the special committee
of Dell’s board considered an array of strategic alternatives,”
Frink said. “In addition to working through financial and
capital-allocation issues with its independent financial
advisors, the committee retained a prominent management
consultant to help it assess the company’s strategic position.”  Dell’s response came after Southeastern, which owns 8.5
percent of Dell’s outstanding shares, today sent a letter to
Dell’s board expressing “extreme disappointment” with the
$24.4 billion buyout offer announced on Feb. 5. Based on an
analysis included in the letter, Memphis, Tennessee-based
Southeastern said Dell should be worth as much as $24 a share.  To contact the reporters on this story:
