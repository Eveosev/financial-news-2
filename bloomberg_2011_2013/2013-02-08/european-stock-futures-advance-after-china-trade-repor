European  stocks advanced the most in
a month, paring a weekly decline, as trade data from China
exceeded estimates and European Union leaders agreed the first-
ever cuts to the bloc’s budget.  Software AG, Germany’s second-biggest software maker, rose
2.7 percent after saying it will buy back shares. Credit
Agricole SA jumped the most in more than four months after Exane
BNP Paribas SA raised its recommendation on the stock. Telecom
Italia SpA declined to a six-month low after posting full-year
earnings below analysts’ projections.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  climbed 1.2 percent to 287.34 at
the close of trading, the most since Jan. 2, paring the week’s
drop to 0.3 percent. It has still gained 2.7 percent so far this
year as U.S. lawmakers agreed on a budget preventing spending
cuts and tax increases that had threatened to push the world’s
biggest economy into recession.  “The improvement in China’s data is a positive for
European equities,”  Richard Scrope , who helps manage 100
million pounds ($159 million) as fund manager at Oriel Asset
Management LLP in London, said in a phone interview. “The
European Union’s decision to cut the budget is a prudent one. A
prioritization of where money should be spent is better than
simply increasing spending on everything.”  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the Stoxx 600 was 6 percent lower than the average over the past
30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China Trade  China’s exports and imports rose more than estimated in a
January that had five working days more than last year, a report
showed.  Exports  increased 25 percent from a year earlier, the
customs administration said, compared with economists’
projection of 17.5 percent. Imports climbed 28.8 percent,
exceeding the 23.5 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey.  EU leaders agreed to a seven-year budget that cuts spending
for the first time, bowing to U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s insistence on thrift.  The deal was struck after 25 1/2 hours of talks in
Brussels, according to a post on Twitter by EU President Herman Van Rompuy  today. While he didn’t disclose a figure, the final
draft blueprint for 2014-2020 included a spending ceiling of 960
billion euros ($1.3 trillion), down from an original proposal of
1.047 trillion euros and less than the 994 billion euros spent
in the current budget cycle.  European Earnings  Of the 108 companies in the Stoxx 600 that have reported
since Jan. 8, 50 percent exceeded analysts’ profit estimates,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings for 2012 at
companies in the index will drop 1.2 percent, estimates compiled
by Bloomberg show.  National benchmark indexes advanced in all of the 18
western European markets except Greece. The U.K.’s FTSE 100
gained 0.6 percent, France’s CAC 40 rose 1.4 percent and
Germany’s DAX added 0.8 percent.  Software AG  advanced 76 cents to 29.23 euros. Germany’s
second-biggest software maker said late yesterday it will spend
as much as 180 million euros buying back shares.  Credit Agricole  rallied 6.9 percent to 7.35 euros, the most
since Oct. 1. BNP Paribas raised its recommendation on France’s
third-largest bank to buy from hold, citing the improved
credibility of management and higher solvency than estimated.  BNP Paribas  added 2.4 percent to 44.60 euros after Bank of
America advised buying the shares, saying the lender’s results
should confirm it has enough capital to support growth.  Betting Gains  Bwin.Party Digital Entertainment Plc  jumped 16 percent to
136 pence, the most since December 2011, while  888 Holdings Plc 
surged 17 percent to 135 pence, its highest price since
September 2008.  The British betting companies climbed after New Jersey
Governor Chris Christie, who vetoed Internet gambling in 2011,
said yesterday he would allow a 10-year trial period of online
wagers for games conducted in Atlantic City casinos.  Telecom Italia  slipped 1.3 percent to 66 euro cents, its
lowest price since August, after reporting 2012 earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 11.7 billion
euros. Analysts on average had estimated 11.8 billion euros.  TDC A/S  retreated 2 percent to 40.15 kroner after a person
familiar with the matter said a stock sale in Denmark’s biggest
phone company has been increased to 120 million shares from 80
million yesterday. UBS AG, which is managing the sale, has
enough demand to cover the offer, said the person, who asked not
to be identified because the deal is private.  Getinge AB  tumbled 4.8 percent to 189.4 kronor after the
Swedish maker of sterilization systems said it won’t reach its
operating margin target this year or in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
