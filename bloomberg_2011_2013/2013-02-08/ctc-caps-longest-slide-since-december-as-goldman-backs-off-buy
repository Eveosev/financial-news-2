  CTC Media Inc.  fell a sixth day,
the longest losing streak since December, after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. downgraded the Russian television company less than a
month after recommending investors buy the stock.  Shares of CTC traded on the  Nasdaq Composite Index  dropped
0.9 percent to $10.08 in New York today, the lowest close since
Jan. 24. Trading volume exceeded the daily average for the past
three months by 52 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
This week’s 5.4 percent slump trimmed CTC’s advance in 2013 to
30 percent. The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index  of the most-
traded Russian stocks in the U.S. added 0.4 percent today to
104.29.  The recent rally in CTC’s shares -- it is the best
performer on the Russia-US gauge this year -- and a slowdown in
Russian advertising will curb further gains in the stock,
 Alexander Balakhnin , a Moscow-based Goldman analyst, wrote in a
report dated yesterday that  downgraded  CTC to neutral.  Goldman rated CTC shares a buy Jan. 11 on prospects a focus
on younger viewers will stoke revenue growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
