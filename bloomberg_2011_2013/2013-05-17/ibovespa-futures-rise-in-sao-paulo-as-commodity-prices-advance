Ibovespa futures  advanced, a sign
that the stock gauge may pare a second weekly drop, as higher
commodities prices boosted the outlook for raw-material
producers in  Brazil .  Port operator Santos Brasil Participacoes SA may move as
Brazil’s Congress passed a bill late yesterday changing labor
regulations for the industry and setting new rules for those
seeking license renewals. Insurer Sul America SA may be active
after saying shareholder ING Groep NV sold a stake to the World
Bank’s private-lending arm International Finance Corp.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in June advanced 0.8
percent to 55,120 at 9:13 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real weakened
0.1 percent to 2.0290 per dollar, depreciating for a fourth day.
The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials added 0.6
percent, a second day of gains. Commodities producers have a 42
percent  weighting  in Ibovespa.  The gauge has declined 10 percent this year, the most among
19 major  emerging markets , data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Brazil’s benchmark equity index  trades  at 12.1 times analysts’
earnings estimates for the next four quarters, compared with a
multiple of 10.9 for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index of 21
developing nations’ equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume for stocks in  Sao Paulo  was 7.87 billion
