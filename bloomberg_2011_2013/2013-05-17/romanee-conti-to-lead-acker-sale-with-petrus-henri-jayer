A case of Romanee-Conti 1996 Domaine
de la Romanee-Conti Burgundy carrying an upper estimate of
$40,000 is top lot at Acker Merrall & Condit’s  New York  auction
this week, along with wines from  Chateau Petrus  and Henri Jayer.  Leading Burgundies include 12 bottles of La Romanee 2009
Comte Liger-Belair, priced by the auction house to fetch as much
as $32,000, and three bottles of Romanee-Conti 2004 DRC with a
price tag of as much as $30,000 at the sale on May 22.  Investor demand has revived this year after a 17-month
price slide which started in July 2011, boosting the Liv-ex Fine
Wine 50 Index by 9 percent since November. The index, which fell
in April after posting four straight monthly gains, has still
risen more than 5 percent since the start of January. The Liv-ex
Fine Wine 100 Index, calculated monthly, is up 5.9 percent.  “Secondary market trading softened a little in April
following four positive months as focus turned to the release of
the 2012 vintage” in Bordeaux, according to a monthly report
from London-based Wine Asset Managers LLP, which has $20 million
under management. “The downside remains very limited.”  Two half-cases of Petrus 2005 Pomerol are priced at as much
as $24,000 each in the Acker sale, while six bottles of Vosne
Romanee 1996 Cros Parantoux from Henri Jayer are similarly
estimated to fetch as much as $24,000.  At a  Sotheby’s (BID)  sale in London the same day, eleven lots of
1982 Bordeaux, including eight cases of  Chateau Latour  and three
double magnums of Chateau Petrus, are estimated to fetch as much
as 12,000 pounds ($18,600) each.  A single bottle of Romanee-Conti 2005 DRC carries a price
tag of as much as 8,000 pounds, while a similar one from 2009 is
estimated at as much as 7,500 pounds, according to the Sotheby’s
online catalog. Eight cases of Chateau Latour 1996 are estimated
at as much as 4,400 pounds each.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
