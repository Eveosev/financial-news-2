General Motors Co. (GM) , poised to rejoin
the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) , topped its $33 initial public
offering price for the first time in more than two years as the
automaker prepares to introduce redesigned full-size pickups.  GM rose 3.2 percent to $33.42 at the close in New York
after touching $33.77. The shares peaked at $38.98 at the close
on Jan. 7, 2011, less than two months after its November 2010
IPO. They slid below the IPO price in March 2011, and reached a
low closing price of $18.80 in July 2012.  Confidence in Detroit-based GM is growing as the  U.S.
Treasury  sells down its  stake , helping facilitate a return to
the  S&P 500 . The automaker also plans to introduce about 20 new
vehicles in the U.S. this year, including profitable Chevrolet
Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups, as it seeks to rebound from an
88-year-low market share in 2012.  “The turnaround story that they’ve been outlining, it’s
really starting to come together,” David Whiston, an equity
analyst with  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  in Chicago, said today in a
telephone interview. “Especially next year, I think, is going
to be fantastic for them” as sales of the new trucks take hold.  GM’s share price may also be a milestone in the political
debate whether the U.S. should have provided a $49.5 billion
bailout in 2009. Critics dubbed GM “Government Motors.”
Republican 2012 challenger  Mitt Romney  attacked President  Barack
Obama  on the issue.  The automaker has said it expects modest improvement this
year compared with 2012, when it earned  $6.19 billion , the third
profitable year since emerging from its 2009 U.S.-backed
bankruptcy reorganization.  Rebound Begins  Shares began to slowly rebound in August as GM held talks
with labor unions about cutting work hours at its main factory
in  Germany  to lower production. The company later in the year
also discussed its new product lineup for 2013, including
Silverado, GM’s top-selling vehicle in the U.S. Full-size
pickups are the main source of profit for GM as well as its
U.S.-based competitors  Ford Motor Co. (F)  and Chrysler Group LLC.  GM shares in December reached their highest price in 10
months after GM announced it would spend $5.5 billion to buy 200
million shares back from the U.S. Treasury, and the government
said it would sell the rest of the holding within 15 months. As
of April 1, the Treasury held 241.7 million shares, representing
a 16.4 percent stake, according to GM’s proxy statement.  GM joined Ford and Chrysler in gaining U.S. market share in
the first quarter for the first time in 20 years, fueled by
their most competitive lineup from top to bottom in a
generation.  “There are some things that have improved” since July,
said Christian Mayes, an analyst with  Edward Jones . “You’re
seeing more interest from fund managers and that type of
investor.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
