Jockey Joel Rosario, who will be
aboard Preakness Stakes favorite Orb today, rode filly
Fiftyshadesofhay to victory yesterday in the Black-Eyed Susan
Stakes.  The winner, trained by  Bob Baffert , surged in the stretch
yesterday to overtake Marathon Lady and win by a neck.
Fiftyshadesofhay ran the 1 1/8 mile in one minute, 52.73 seconds.
Toasting was third.  If Rosario guides Orb to victory today at Pimlico Race
Course in Baltimore, the colt will become the 34th 3-year-old to
win the Derby and Preakness, the first two legs of the Triple
Crown. Eleven have gone on to capture the Belmont Stakes, the
finale of the series, scheduled this year on June 8.  “I wasn’t sure turning for home because I told Rosario
that she usually runs 1-2-3, but ride her the way you feel you
should ride her,” Baffert said in a statement. “Rosario sort
of did his own thing today, but it was the right thing.”  Fiftyshadesofhay’s victory gives Baffert a chance at a
weekend Pimlico sweep of the Black-Eyed Susan and Preakness with
a win today by Govenor Charlie, who leaves from the eighth post
position in the nine-horse field with early odds of 16-1.  Fiftyshadesofhay paid $6.60 to win on a $2 bet, $3.80 to
place and $3 to show. Marathon Lady returned $8.40 and $4.80 and
Toasting paid $5.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
