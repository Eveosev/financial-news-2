A Moscow court today put the head of
 Societe Generale SA (GLE) ’s Russian unit under house arrest for two
months on charges of commercial bribery, his lawyer Dmitry
Kharitonov said by phone.  OAO Rosbank Chief Executive Officer Vladimir Golubkov was
caught in a sting operation with cash on his desk allegedly from
a client seeking to modify the terms of a loan. He faces as long
as seven years in prison if convicted, according to Kharitonov.  Golubkov, who denies any wrongdoing, had requested to be
released on bail of 45 million rubles ($1.4 million), the lawyer
said. His former boss at Rosbank, billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov ,
sent a request to the court asking for Golubkov, who he said
“had always been an honest and professional person,” not to be
held in detention.  Golubkov is one of the most senior bankers ever arrested
for bribery in Russia, according to the  Interior Ministry . When
his office was raided, the CEO had 5 million rubles ($159,000)
of the $1.5 million he demanded from a company to prolong a loan
and reduce its  interest rate , according to police.  Golubkov joined Rosbank in 1999 and became CEO in September
2008 after Paris-based Societe Generale, France’s second-biggest
lender, gained control, according to Rosbank’s website. Born in
1966, he graduated from Moscow State Technical University in
1990.  After the sting operation,  Rosbank (ROSB)  named First Deputy CEO
Igor Antonov as interim chief.  To contact the reporters on this story:
