Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures gained,
signaling benchmark indexes may extend a rally after climbing to
the highest since November 2010 yesterday, as overseas funds
continued record purchases of local shares.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for May delivery rose 0.5
percent to 6,203 at 10:13 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying CNX
 Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. rose
0.4 percent to 6,169.90 yesterday. The S&P BSE Sensex index
advanced 0.2 percent. The Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR
Index of U.S.-traded shares fell 0.4 percent.  Foreigners bought a net $311 million of Indian stocks on
May 15, the most since Feb. 7, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That takes this year’s net investment to $13.1
billion, an all-time high for the period, the data show.  “Foreign funds are likely to increase their India
allocation compared with other  emerging markets ,” Anita Gandhi,
a director at Arihant Capital Markets Ltd. in Mumbai, said by
phone yesterday.  The Sensex has rallied 11 percent since sinking to a seven-month low on April 9, as foreign funds extended  purchases  amid
monetary easing by global central banks, and as slowing
inflation and weakening economic growth prompted the central
bank to cut  interest rates  on May 3 for a third time this year.  The gauge is valued at 13.9 times  forecast 12-month
profits , the most expensive since October, compared with the
MSCI Emerging Markets Index’s 10.6 times.  ITC Ltd. (ITC) , India’s largest cigarette maker, may report today
fourth-quarter net income of 18.97 billion rupees ($346
million), according to the median estimate of 31 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  Profits at just two of the 15 Sensex companies that have
reported March-quarter earnings have  trailed  estimates, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with about 43 percent
that missed forecasts in the three months ended Dec. 31, and 40
percent in the previous two quarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
