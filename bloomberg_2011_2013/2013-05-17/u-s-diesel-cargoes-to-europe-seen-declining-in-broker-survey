Shipments of  diesel  to Europe from
the U.S. Gulf Coast are poised to decline over the next two
weeks, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Traders will charter nine Medium Range tankers for loading
to May 29, the average estimates of four shipbrokers
specializing in the trade showed. That’s two fewer ships than in
last week’s corresponding survey. Each vessel would normally
carry about 38,000 metric tons of the fuel.  The survey is based on the Houston-to-Amsterdam route, a
benchmark for the trade that takes about 17 days at 12.5 knots,
according to the sea-distances.com website. Costs to haul
refined products to Europe climbed 28 percent this month to
96.79 industry-standard Worldscale points, according to the
Baltic Exchange in  London .  Six of the projected bookings have been arranged and the
rest are anticipated, the latest survey showed. Twenty-nine
tankers will be seeking cargoes, four more than last week,
according to the shipbrokers.  The table below details numbers of ships booked, likely to
be hired and available for charter for the two weeks from the
stated dates.  *T                             May 15      May 8      Change
