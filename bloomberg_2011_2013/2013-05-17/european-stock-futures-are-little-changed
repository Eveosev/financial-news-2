European stocks climbed to their
highest level in almost five years as a report showed that U.S.
 consumer confidence  rose more than economists had predicted,
while banks and carmakers increased.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  climbed above the price at which
the U.K. government has said it will break even on its 39
percent stake in the lender. European carmakers rose to their
highest level since November 2007 as vehicle sales in the region
increased for the first time in 19 months. FLSmidth & Co. A/S
sank 9.7 percent after  Europe ’s biggest maker of cement-production lines said it signed fewer large orders.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.2 percent to 308.72 at
the close of trading, its highest level since June 2008. The
equity benchmark has climbed 1.2 percent this week, completing a
fourth week of gains.  “U.S. consumers -- customer number one for the global
economy -- are continuing to spend and this is making us more
relaxed about the prospects for the global economy,”   Kevin Gardiner , head of investment strategy for Barclays Plc’s wealth-management unit in  London , told Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg
Television. “People think that central banks are providing a
lifeline for the economy, but we’re past that phase now and I
think the economy can increasingly stand on its own two feet.”  In the U.S., the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan
preliminary index of  consumer sentiment  rose to 83.7 in May from
76.4 in April, a report today showed. The  median projection  in a
Bloomberg survey had called for a gain to 77.9. The forecasts
ranged from 74 to 82.5.  Leading Indicators  A separate release showed that an index of U.S. leading
indicators climbed 0.6 percent in April. That exceeded the 0.2
percent median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the Stoxx 600 was 17 greater than the average of the past 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  National benchmark indexes advanced in 15 of the 17
western-European markets that opened today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100
rose 0.5 percent and  Germany ’s DAX Index added 0.3 percent.
 France ’s CAC 40 Index climbed 0.6 percent to its highest level
since July 2011. Markets in  Norway  were closed today for the
Constitution Day public holiday.  Lloyds gained 3.2 percent to 62.84 pence, its highest price
in more than two years. The U.K.’s largest mortgage lender
exceeded the 61 pence threshold below which the Treasury has
said it would recognize a loss from selling its  shares . The
state paid more than $30 billion to rescue the lender in 2008.  Carmakers Rally  European carmakers, which have rallied 21 percent in the
past four weeks, were the best-performing industry group on the
Stoxx 600. PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault SA jumped 10 percent
to 7.14 euros and 3.6 percent to 61.29 euros, respectively,
after a report showed car sales increased 1.8 percent in April.
Registrations rebounded in Germany and  Spain .  A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S gained 1.5 percent to 41,840
kroner. The company’s Maersk Line unit posted profit of $204
million in the first quarter, more than the $160 million average
analyst prediction. The  container-shipping business  said freight
rates recovered in the three-month period as it helped to limit
overcapacity by slowing the speed of its ships and reducing the
size of its fleet.  Ocado Group Plc surged 36 percent to 274.1 pence, the most
since its initial public offering in July 2010. Wm Morrison
Supermarkets Plc said it will pay the Internet grocer as much as
170 million pounds ($258 million) for a 25-year online
partnership. Trading volume was nine times the daily average of
the past three months, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  FLSmidth, Intertek  FLSmidth sank 9.7 percent to 302 kroner after posting  net
income  of 37 million kroner ($6.4 million) in the first quarter,
less than the 231 million-krone  average estimate  in a Bloomberg
survey. Sales of 5.65 billion kroner also missed  analysts’
predictions  for revenue of 5.89 billion kroner.  Intertek Group Plc slid 1.9 percent to 3,385 pence, its
biggest decline in almost two months. The consumer-goods testing
company said that its operating-profit margin has narrowed from
a year earlier as net income at its minerals unit declined.
Profit at the minerals business will continue to drop into the
second half of the year, the company forecast.  Coca-Cola HBC AG, the bottling company that moved its
primary listing to London from  Athens  last month, slumped 5.3
percent to 1,775 pence. Credit Suisse Group AG is placing 6.4
million shares of the company, equivalent to a stake of about
1.7 percent, according to terms obtained by  Bloomberg News .  To contact the reporter on this story:
