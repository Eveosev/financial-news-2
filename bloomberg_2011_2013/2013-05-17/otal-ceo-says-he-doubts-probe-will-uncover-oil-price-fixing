Total SA (FP) ’s chief executive officer
said he would be “very surprised” if a European investigation
uncovered price-fixing in the crude and oil-products markets.  “Knowing the companies that are named, I would be very
surprised if they contributed to manipulation of prices,”
Christophe De Margerie told reporters today in Paris after the
annual general meeting of Europe’s third-biggest oil company. De
Margerie denied that Total had lodged a complaint with the
European Commission that may have sparked the probe.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc and Statoil, three of
Europe’s biggest oil explorers, are being investigated by EC
officials about potential manipulation of prices in the $3.4
trillion-a-year global crude market. Platts, owned by  McGraw
Hill Financial Inc. (MHFI) , is also a target.  “I know Statoil and I can’t imagine that company
manipulating prices,” de Margerie said. “I know their ethics.
I don’t see a big scandal.”  Statoil Chief Executive Officer Helge Lund has said the
company doesn’t tolerate violations of European Union laws.  Total SA has estimated that as much as 80 percent of all
crude and oil-product transactions are linked to reference
prices such as those published by Platts, while as much as 20
percent are linked to exchange-traded futures on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange and ICE Futures Europe.  “The system isn’t perfect but that doesn’t mean there’s
price fixing,” de Margerie said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
