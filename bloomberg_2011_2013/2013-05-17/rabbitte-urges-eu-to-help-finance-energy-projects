The European Commission should do
more to help European Union member states come up with financing
for energy-efficiency projects, Irish Energy Minister Pat Rabbitte said.  The commission could go further to help countries create
new financing vehicles by securing preferential debt-accounting
treatment from Eurostat, the EU’s statistics office, Rabbitte
told reporters in Brussels today. As an example, he cited
Ireland’s use of 35 million euros ($45 million) in public funds
to attract private-sector financing for efficiency projects in
public and commercial buildings.  “In Ireland, we’ve had direct experience of trying to be
creative in terms of new vehicles that might facilitate and
accelerate the energy efficiency drive,” Rabbitte said. “We’re
finding it difficult to navigate those measures through the
commission.”  EU leaders are set to discuss energy prices and efficiency-project financing when they meet May 22 in Brussels. Rabbitte
said the 27-nation bloc also should consider the effects of the
U.S. becoming more self-sufficient because of new shale gas
energy sources.  “The implications of the shale gas revolution in the
 United States  have been dramatic,” Rabbitte said. “There are
competitiveness issues here raised for  Europe .”  Shale-gas production has contributed to a widening gap
between U.S. and EU industrial prices for energy, according to a
commission report prepared for next week’s summit. “In 2012,
industry gas prices were more than four times lower in the U.S.
than in Europe,” the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
