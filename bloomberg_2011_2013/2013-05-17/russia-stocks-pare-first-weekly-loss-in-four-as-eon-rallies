Russian  equities  pared their first
weekly drop in four as crude oil fluctuated and EON  Russia , a
unit of  Germany ’s largest utility, surged after its board
recommended boosting dividends to 100 percent of profit.  The Micex  gauge  added less than 0.1 percent to 1,374.38 by
11:10 a.m. in Moscow, poised for a 3.7 percent fall in the week.  Crude oil, Russia’s chief export earner, swung between
gains and losses before trading down 0.2 percent at $95.02 a
barrel in  New York . The oil and natural gas industries account
for about half of Russia’s budget revenue. EON Russia jumped as
much as 9.4 percent, trading up 7.5 percent at 2.7599 rubles.
The company’s board recommended paying 29 kopeks a share in 2012
dividends, General Director Maxim Shirokov said today in Moscow.  “The investment case for the Russian utilities universe
has now narrowed to this particular stock,” Vladimir Sklyar, an
analyst at  Renaissance Capital , said in an e-mailed note,
reiterating a buy recommendation.  OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s biggest coking-coal producer, declined
0.4 percent to 112.70 rubles, poised for the lowest since
February 2009. Preferred shares sank 1.6 percent to 56.89
rubles. The American depositary receipts lost 4.4 percent to
$3.52 yesterday. MSCI Inc. cut the company’s depositary receipts
from its Russia Index, according to a statement on May 15.  OAO Novolipetsk Steel fell 1 percent to 45 rubles. The
steelmaker’s Global Depositary Receipts slipped 4.7 percent to
$14.50 yesterday as MSCI excluded the GDRs from its Russia index
along with Mechel’s ADRs and OAO Russian Grids. Funds that track
MSCI indexes readjust their portfolios based on the changes
before the rebalancing takes effect on June 3.  Cheapest Stocks  VTB Group, Russia’s second-biggest lender, retreated 1
percent to 4.38 kopeks. The pre-emptive rights offering for
VTB’s local shares closes today.  The volume of shares traded on the Micex was 16 percent
above the gauge’s 30-day average, while the index’s 10-day price
swings plunged to 12.65.  Russian equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
 emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg. The Micex trades at 5.1
times its 12-month estimated earnings and has lost 6.8 percent
this year, compared with a 10.6 multiple for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index, which has dropped 1.1 percent in the period.  The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  fell 0.2 percent to
1,378.32. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in  stock futures , added 0.1 percent to 21.72. The
Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded Russian
companies in the U.S. slipped 1.3 percent to 92.58 yesterday.
The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated Russian
exchange-traded fund, tumbled 2 percent to 26.54 in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
