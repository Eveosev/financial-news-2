Douglas Shulman, the former
commissioner of the  Internal Revenue Service , will testify
before Congress May 22, said Ali Ahmad, spokesman for the House
Oversight and Government Reform Committee.  Shulman, whose term ended in November 2012, hasn’t spoken
publicly since it was disclosed on May 10 that the IRS had
applied tougher scrutiny to Tea Party groups seeking tax-exempt
status.  The former IRS commissioner told a House Ways and Means
subcommittee in March 2012 that the agency didn’t engage in
targeting based on ideology. The IRS has said Shulman didn’t
know all the facts at the time.  Lois Lerner, who oversees tax-exempt organizations for the
IRS, hasn’t told the committee whether she will testify.  CBS
News  reported that Lerner’s lawyer told lawmakers she is in
 Montreal . Ahmad said that report is correct.  To contact the reporter on this story:
