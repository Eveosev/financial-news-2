Allied Electronics Corp. (ATN) , a maker of
pay-television set-top boxes, offered to buy the shares it
doesn’t already own in  Allied Technologies (ALT)  Ltd. to simplify the
structure of the two companies and make savings.  Allied Electronics, also known as Altron, will offer 47.50
rand in cash for each Allied Technologies share, the
Johannesburg-based company said in a statement today. That
values Altech at 5.04 billion rand ($532 million), according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The offer equates to a 32 percent premium to Altech’s
closing price of 35.96 rand on March 20, the last trading day
before the company said it was in talks that could materially
affect the share price.  Altron already owns 61 percent of Altech’s shares, it said
in the statement.  “From the Altron shareholders side it’s probably not the
greatest deal especially given that they are offering quite a
premium for the shares,” Dirk Noeth, electronics analyst at
Avior Research Pty Ltd, said in a telephone interview from  Cape
Town .  Altech  shares  rose 30 percent to 44.60 rand at the close of
trading in Johannesburg, giving the company a market value of
4.7 billion rand ($500 million). Altron shares were unchanged at
20.50 rand.  The transaction will “simplify the corporate and operating
structure of the Altron Group” and “enable the maximisation of
synergies”, Altron said in the statement today. Altron Chief
Executive Officer Robert Venter is the brother of Altech
counterpart Craig.  Altech shareholders may receive 2.22 Altron shares for each
Altech share they own instead of cash, Altron said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
