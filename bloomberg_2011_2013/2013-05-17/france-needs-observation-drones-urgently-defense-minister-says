France  is looking to buy unmanned
surveillance aircraft to strengthen its reconnaissance
capabilities, the country’s Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian
said today at a news conference in a Washington.  Le Drian, who was in Washington to meet U.S. Defense
Secretary Chuck Hagel as well as lawmakers and White House
officials, said France had an “urgent need” for such drones.  The lack of remotely piloted observation planes was evident
during the French military operation in Mali, Le Drian said. Le
Drian said he had discussed France’s need with U.S. officials.
The talks are continuing and no sales were concluded, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
