Officials from  Bangladesh  are
lobbying U.S. President  Barack Obama ’s administration not to
revoke trade preferences as it reviews worker-safety conditions
in the Asian nation.  A delegation from Bangladesh met with officials from the
U.S. Trade Representative’s office on May 15 to discuss the
agency’s study of the trade benefits, agency spokeswoman Kate
Villarreal said today in an e-mail.  The April 24 collapse of a garment factory in Bangladesh,
which killed more than 1,000 people, has highlighted the
nation’s worker-safety conditions.  The trade representative’s office said in a Jan. 8  notice 
in the Federal Register that “the lack of progress by the
government of Bangladesh in addressing worker rights issues in
the country warrants consideration of possible withdrawal,
suspension or limitation Bangladesh’s trade benefits.”  The agency is scheduled to decide in June whether to pursue
the matter further.  Bangladesh participates in a U.S. program known as the
Generalized System of Preferences, which allows zero or reduced
tariffs on some products imported into the U.S. from  developing
countries .  Officials from Bangladesh met with officials from the trade
office and other U.S. agencies on the trade-preference review,
Villarreal said.  “The information provided by the Bangladeshi delegation
will be taken into account as the administration considers next
steps in the GSP review,” she said.  Officials from the Bangladeshi Embassy in  Washington  didn’t
immediately respond to a request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
