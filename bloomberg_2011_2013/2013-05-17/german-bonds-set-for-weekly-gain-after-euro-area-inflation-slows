Spanish and Italian  government bonds 
gained for a third day after successful debt sales by the two
nations this week and a report yesterday showing  inflation  in
the euro area slowed boosted demand for fixed-income assets.  Spain ’s  10-year yield  dropped the most in two weeks on
speculation investors’ view of the country is recovering after
it sold 7 billion euros ($8.97 billion) of 10-year bonds through
banks on May 14. Italy allotted 6 billion euros of 30-year debt
the following day. Austrian, Belgian and French bonds also rose
as European Central Bank Executive Board Member Joerg Asmussen
said he doesn’t see inflation pressure and policy will remain
expansive as long as needed. German bunds were little changed.  “The syndicated sales show that it’s not really much of an
issue to even place 30-year Italian bonds with investors, and
they don’t seem that averse to duration exposure,” said
Christian Lenk, a fixed-income analyst at DZ Bank AG in
 Frankfurt , referring to investors holding longer-maturity debt.
“In the first half of May we saw some spread widening and this
profit-taking seems to have found the end for now.”  Spain’s 10-year yield fell 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 4.21 percent at the 5 p.m. close in  London ,
the biggest decline since May 2. The 5.4 percent bond due in
September 2023 rose 0.835, or 8.35 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 109.325.  Italy’s 10-year yield dropped eight basis points to 3.90
percent, also the biggest decline since May 2.  Successful Sales  Spain’s syndication attracted bids for more than 21 billion
euros of debt, according to a person with knowledge of the deal
who asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to
speak about it. Italy garnered 12.7 billion euros of bids for
its 30-year bonds, a person close to the transaction said.  Annual consumer-price inflation in the euro area slowed to
1.2 percent in April from 1.7 percent this previous month, the
European Union Statistics Office said yesterday. Prices dropped
0.1 percent from March. Slower inflation enhances the purchasing
power of the fixed payments from bonds.  Austria’s  10-year yield  fell two basis points to 1.69
percent, while similar-maturity Belgian yields dropped two basis
points to 2 percent and  France ’s declined two basis points to
1.86 percent.  The ECB doesn’t see any inflation pressures at present and
inflation expectations are “firmly anchored,” Asmussen said in
Berlin. The German economy is robust at the moment and the
second quarter is likely to be better than the first, he said.  Germany ’s 10-year yield was little changed at 1.33 percent
after dropping to 1.29 percent, the lowest since May 10. The
 two-year rate  declined two basis points to minus 0.029 percent.
A negative yield means investors who hold the security until it
matures will receive less than they paid to buy it.  Greek Bonds  Greek  10-year bonds  advanced for a fourth day, with the
yield dropping 26 basis points to 8.29 percent after falling to
8.11 percent, the lowest since June 2010.  Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said in Beijing the
nation’s future is linked to the euro zone and the country
forecasts a primary surplus in 2013. He is visiting  China  in an
attempt to lure foreign investors to help revive an economy
after 19 straight quarters of contraction.  The  extra yield  that investors demand to hold Greek 10-year
securities instead of similar-maturity German bunds shrank 26
basis points to 6.96 percentage points after narrowing below
seven percentage points on May 15 for the first time since
October 2010.  Volatility on Portuguese bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Spain and Germany, according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Spanish bonds returned 7.4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italy’s
securities gained 4.5 percent, and Germany’s rose 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
