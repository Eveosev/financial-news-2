Cementos Argos SA (CEMARGOS)  fell the most in a
week as traders discounted the Colombian cement maker’s common
stock on the first day of trading for its new preferred shares,
which pay a higher dividend.  The  common shares  fell 0.7 percent to 8,120 pesos at the
close in Bogota, the biggest drop since May 10. The preferred
shares, sold last week for 7,700 apiece, advanced 6 percent to
8,160 pesos. The preferred shares were the most heavily traded
securities today on  Colombia ’s stock exchange, where the
benchmark Colcap index gained 0.2 percent.  The common shares should carry a price roughly 145 pesos
below that for the preferred shares, Juliana Valencia, an
analyst at Credicorp Capital’s Colombia unit, said in a
telephone interview. The gap between the two is about 40 pesos
at the current  price levels .  “The market was expecting a big gain for the preferred
immediately,” Valencia said.  The Medellin-based company raised 1.4 trillion pesos ($760
million) through the preferred sale.  Cemargos will use the funds “to increase financial
flexibility mainly to search for growth options,” including
potential acquisitions and capacity expansion, Chief Executive
Officer Jorge Mario Velasquez said today at an event in Bogota.  To contact the reporter on this story:
