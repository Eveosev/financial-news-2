Aruba Networks Inc. (ARUN)  fell the most in
in more than five years after the maker of wireless-network
equipment forecast quarterly results that trailed analysts’
estimates amid increased competition from  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)   The  shares  sank 26 percent to $13.10 at the close in New
York, for the biggest one-day drop since February 2008. The
stock has declined 37 percent this year, as the Russell 2000
Index gained 17 percent.  Aruba Networks gave the forecast yesterday and said on a
conference call that it expects a “heightened level of
competition.” Cisco, its biggest rival, is affecting the timing
of the Sunnyvale, California-based company’s deal closings, Tim Long, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets Group in New York, wrote
in an investor note today.  “Cisco bundling or cutting prices will likely lead to
further share gains for them, and a tougher time for the smaller
players,” said Long, who rates shares of Aruba Networks market
perform.  Profit excluding some items will be 10 cents to 12 cents
for the fiscal fourth quarter that ends in July, Aruba Networks
said on the call. The company forecast revenue of as much as
$150 million. The averages of analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg were for earnings of 16 cents and sales of $152.8
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
