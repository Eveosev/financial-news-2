Empresas ICA SAB (ICA*) ’s credit rating was
cut one level by Moody’s Investors Service amid declining
earnings at Mexico’s largest construction company and delays in
public-works spending by President Enrique Pena Nieto.  The Mexico City-based builder’s corporate-family rating was
lowered to B2, or five levels below investment grade, from B1.
Moody’s said it may lower the rating further.  Revenue in the construction unit fell 41 percent in the
first quarter from a year earlier and the backlog of contracts
dropped 7 percent from Dec. 31, ICA said last month. Earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization slid 21
percent to 1.11 billion pesos ($90 million), the lowest level in
two years.  “The downgrade on ICA’s ratings was based on the company’s
weaker-than-expected credit metrics, especially the very high
leverage and modest interest coverage, as well as its weak
liquidity,” Nymia Almeida, a Moody’s analyst, said in a report.  The new government, which took office in December, has yet
to announce detailed infrastructure spending plans and has been
slow to award new projects, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
