Jon Brod, chief executive officer of
 AOL Inc. (AOL) ’s local-news division Patch, is stepping down from the
role and will return to AOL Ventures, the investment arm.  Steve Kalin, Patch’s chief operating officer, will replace
Brod, according to an internal memo from AOL CEO  Tim Armstrong 
that was obtained by  Bloomberg News . AOL is also cutting 40 of
its 1,400 jobs, according to a person with knowledge of the
plans who asked not be identified because the matter is still
private.  The Patch personnel moves are part of a series of executive
changes by Armstrong as he seeks to transform the dial-up
Internet company into an advertising-driven content publisher.
Earlier this year, he appointed Susan Lyne head of the company’s
brand division, which comprises Patch as well as the business
operations of TechCrunch and the Huffington Post.  AOL, based in New York, has spent more than $300 million to
develop Patch, which generated less than $40 million last year,
missing its sales target by about 25 percent, according to
Armstrong.  Hurricane Sandy  affected ad sales in several hundred
towns Patch covers.  The executive changes were reported earlier by  AllThingsD .  To contact the reporter on this story:
