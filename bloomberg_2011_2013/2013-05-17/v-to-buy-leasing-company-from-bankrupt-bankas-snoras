LHV Pank AS , an Estonian banking
group, and RAZFin of  Lithuania  agreed to buy leasing company
Snoro Lizingas UAB from bankrupt Lithuanian lender Bankas Snoras
AB for 74 million litai ($28 million).  The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and
should be completed by the end of July, Vilnius-based Snoras
said in an e-mailed statement today, citing bankruptcy
administrator Neil Cooper.  Snoras, once Lithuania’s third-biggest bank by deposits,
was declared bankrupt and taken over by the central bank in
November 2011 after assets were discovered missing from its
balance sheet.  “We’ve long sought expansion options in the Baltic region,
but with trustworthy partners and a business of reasonable
size,” LHV Chief Executive Officer Erki Kilu said in a separate
e-mailed statement. “Snoras Leasing has a loan portfolio that
makes up 6 percent of LHV Pank’s balance sheet. This is a
suitable size to start with.”  RAZFin is a Lithuanian  investment company  controlled
jointly by the  Zabolis Partners  private equity firm and the
Rakauskas family, Snoras said in its statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
