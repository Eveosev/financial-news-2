Colombian  industrial output 
contracted more than twice as much as analysts had expected in
March, led by a slump in vehicle sales.  Industrial production shrank 11.5 percent in March from a
year earlier, the national statistics agency said today in a
report, the biggest drop since April 2009. The result was worse
than all 21 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey, whose median
forecast was for a 4.5 percent contraction.  Manufacturers have been hit by a rally in the peso and the
weak global economy, according to the central bank. Policy
makers will discuss whether to extend a dollar purchase program
at the central bank’s May policy meeting, Finance Minister
 Mauricio Cardenas  said in a radio interview today.  Cardenas told RCN Radio that the strong currency is the
“mother of all problems” for Colombian industry and
agriculture.  The peso has rallied 22 percent since 2008, the biggest
rally among 24 major emerging market tracked by Bloomberg after
the Chilean peso. The central bank said in January that it would
buy at least $30 million per day between February and May.  Retail sales rose 0.9 percent, higher than the -0.1 percent
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  The vehicle industry contracted 31 percent, while paper and
card output fell 18 percent. Oil refining rose 9.8 percent from
a year earlier.  The result was distorted by the Easter holidays falling in
March, Hector Suescun, an analyst at Banco de Bogota, said in a
phone interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
