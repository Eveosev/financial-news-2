Wheat slid, capping the biggest
weekly drop since March, on signs that global production will
rise to a record as exports lag behind last year’s pace in the
U.S., the world’s top shipper.  World output will surge to 701.1 million metric tons in the
year that starts June 1, with gains of 48 percent in Russia and
40 percent in Ukraine, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
May 10. U.S. exporters through May 9 shipped 24.6 million tons
since the start of the marketing year on June 1, down 2 percent
from a year earlier, government data show. Prices have tumbled
28 percent since reaching a four-year high in July.  “When you look around the world, there aren’t many
problems with production,”  Larry Glenn , an analyst at Frontier
Ag in Quinter,  Kansas , said in a telephone interview. “We don’t
have the exports. They’ve been slow because we’ve lost some
business to other countries.”  Wheat futures for July delivery fell 0.7 percent to close
at $6.8325 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
The grain fell 3 percent this week, the biggest decline since
March 29. The commodity has dropped 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
