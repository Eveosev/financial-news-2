Rains in the Black Sea region
yesterday were insufficient to reverse a topsoil moisture
deficit that’s raising concerns for grain crops there, said
French farm adviser Agritel, which has an office in Kiev.  The rain in Ukraine and  Russia ’s far south was enough to
dissolve fertilizer, without being able to moisten seedbeds
throughout, the Paris-based company wrote on its  website  today.
Southern Russia received between 0.25 inch (6 millimeters) and
0.5 inch of rain, Agritel said.  Dryness “is hindering proper establishment of the latest
sown crops, as well as the good development of the crops that
already sprouted,” Agritel said. “Nevertheless, the  weather
forecasts  allow for the possibility of rain over the weekend.”  Soil-moisture levels across most of central and southern
Ukraine dropped to between 60 percent and 70 percent in the
first 10 days of May, from between 70 percent and 80 percent in
the previous 10-day period,  satellite data  published by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
