Mexico’s peso fell, heading for its
worst week since June, as slower-than-forecast economic growth
added to speculation the central bank will cut borrowing costs
and on concern the  Federal Reserve  will reduce stimulus.  The currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 12.3170 per  U.S.
dollar  at 10:37 a.m. in Mexico City, extending its decline this
week to 1.9 percent, the biggest since the five days ended June
1, 2012. The peso has rallied 4.4 percent this year, the biggest
gain among major dollar counterparts.  Nine-month  interest-rate swaps  have have fallen three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, this week to 4.10 percent,
signaling the market projects a 96 percent probability of a rate
cut in that period.  Gross domestic product  rose 0.8 percent in
the first quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace since
the end of 2009, the government reported today.  “The expectation of another cut has increased,” Javier Belaunzaran, who helps manage about $5 billion at Grupo
Financiero Interacciones SA in  Mexico  City, said in a telephone
interview. “It’s not yet a consensus, but I’m hearing more and
more people talking about it.”  The central bank unexpectedly reduced its target lending
rate by a half-percentage point to a record low 4 percent on
March 8 as growth slowed. Policy makers left the benchmark
unchanged at their meeting on April 26.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 4.64 percent today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.23 centavo to 148.03
centavos per peso.  The peso dropped against the dollar along with all of the
other major currencies tracked by Bloomberg on speculation the
Fed is moving closer to ending asset purchases that sent a flood
of investment into higher-yielding emerging-market assets
including Mexico’s bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
