Atlantis the Palm, the hotel owned by
Dubai World Corp. unit Istithmar World PJSC, is seeking an $850
million loan to refinance debt due in 2017, according to two
people with knowledge of the matter.  The resort, which spent $20 million on its launch party in
2008, has hired Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC, Barclays Plc,
Commercial Bank of Dubai PSC, HSBC Holdings Plc, National Bank
of Abu Dhabi PJSC, and Union National Bank PJSC to arrange the
facility, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the deal is private. The banks are marketing the loan to
a wider group of lenders.  It would replace a $700 million 12-year  term loan  raised in
2005 to fund construction of Atlantis, said the people. Barclays
and HSBC were bookrunners on the existing deal, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Istithmar, which owned a 50 percent stake in Atlantis,
bought the other half from former partners Kerzner International
Holdings Ltd. for $250 million last year. The $1.5 billion
 resort  opened on an outer frond of Dubai’s man-made, palm-shaped
island at the peak of the global financial crisis in 2008.  Officials at Istithmar didn’t immediately reply to an e-mail seeking comment on the financing outside of normal working
hours.  Dubai World, one of the sheikhdom’s three main holding
companies, reached an agreement with about 80 banks in March
2011 to repay about $15 billion of loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
