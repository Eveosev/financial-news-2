SSE Plc (SSE) , the U.K.’s second-biggest
energy supplier, agreed to buy a Scottish wind farm from
Britain’s Renewable Energy Systems Ltd. requiring total 200
million pounds ($304 million) investment.  That sum includes the acquisition, development and capital
costs for the 99-megawatt Dunmaglass wind project, the Perth,
Scotland-based utility said today in a statement.  SSE plans to start building the venture near Loch Mhor, 25
kilometers (15.5 miles) south of Inverness, later this year with
completion in early 2016. The project, which received planning
consent in December 2010, will use 33 turbines, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
