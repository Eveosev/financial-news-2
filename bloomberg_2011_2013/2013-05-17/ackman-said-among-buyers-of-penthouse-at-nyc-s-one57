Hedge-fund manager  Bill Ackman  is
among a group of investors who agreed to pay more than $90
million for a duplex penthouse at  Manhattan ’s One57 condominium
tower, a person with knowledge of the deal said.  Upon its completion in 2014, the purchase would be one of
two at the West 57th Street property that would top the highest
price paid for a single Manhattan residence. Another penthouse
at One57, under construction by Extell Development Co., is also
under contract to be sold for more than $90 million.  Ackman, 47, the founder of Pershing Square Capital
Management LP, bought the unit with others as a personal
investment and doesn’t intend to live there, the person said.  The apartment, spanning the 75th and 76th floors of the 90-story skyscraper, was last listed for sale at $115 million,
according to documents filed at the office of  New York  State
Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, which reviews details of
condo plans. The 13,500-square-foot (1,300-square-meter) unit,
known as the “winter garden duplex,” was originally offered at
$98.5 million. Extell increased the price after the penthouse on
the 89th and 90th floors sold for more than $90 million.  The winter garden duplex includes room for either a 2,500-square-foot, glass-enclosed garden or a swimming pool, Extell
President  Gary Barnett  said in an interview last year, after
sales at the tower reached $1 billion.  A message left with Barnett’s assistant, Hepzi Schechter,
seeking comment on the purchase wasn’t immediately returned.
Ackman said he couldn’t comment. His involvement was reported
yesterday on the website of the Wall Street Journal.  Helicopter Views  Buyers at One57 have been putting in deposits based on
floor plans, a model apartment in the 6,000-square-foot offsite
sales office and sample apartment views photographed by a camera
mounted on a drone helicopter that snapped pictures at different
elevations.  The current record for the most expensive residence in
Manhattan was set in February 2012, when former Citigroup Inc.
Chairman Sanford Weill’s full-floor penthouse at 15 Central Park
West sold for $88 million. It was purchased for the daughter of
Russian billionaire  Dmitry Rybolovlev .  To contact the reporter on this story:
