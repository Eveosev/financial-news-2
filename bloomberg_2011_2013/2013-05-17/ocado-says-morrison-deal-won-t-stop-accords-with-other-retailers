Ocado Group Plc’s (OCDO)  deal to help
 William Morrison Supermarkets Plc (MRW)  enter the online grocery
market won’t prevent the Internet merchant striking similar
deals with non-food retailers in the U.K. or international
peers, according to Chief Executive Officer Tim Steiner.  “We can do other deals outside of grocery in the U.K., we
can do any deal we want outside the U.K.,” Steiner said in an
interview today. “We can operate a business with somebody else
if we wanted, most importantly we can do this internationally.”  Ocado surged as much as 47 percent to a record in London
after unveiling a partnership with Morrison that will boost its
coffers by 170 million pounds ($259 million). The deal ties in
with Ocado’s long-stated ambition that it is as much a
technology company as a grocer and that it can make money by
licensing Web shopping technology to other retailers.  For now, Ocado is not in negotiations with other retailers
“but we do talk to people a lot,” Steiner said.  The 25-year agreement with Morrison will help assure
Ocado’s profitability next year and give the company “net cash
on the balance sheet by the end of the year,” said Chief
Financial Officer Duncan Tatton-Brown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
