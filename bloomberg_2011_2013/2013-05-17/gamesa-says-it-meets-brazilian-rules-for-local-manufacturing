Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA,  Spain ’s
biggest wind turbine maker, said it meets  Brazil ’s rules for
local manufacturing, enabling projects using its machines to get
funds from the Banco Nacional de Desarrollo Economico & Social.  Gamesa has a nacelle and hub assembly plant in Camacari,
Bahia state, and its work with local suppliers of towers and
blades led BNDES to certify that the Zamudio-based manufacturer
meets the new requirements, the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  “Brazil is one of our priority markets for the short and
medium term,” Edgard Corrochano, Gamesa’s regional director,
said in the statement. “Our strategy for consolidating the
company as one of the leading turbine makers in Brazil is
underpinned by the combination of our global technological
prowess with local know-how.”  Under the rules introduced four months ago, Brazil requires
gradually higher proportions of locally produced parts to be
included in  wind turbines  between now and 2016, according to
Gamesa. Initial certification required production of at least
three of the following four parts to be made in Brazil: the
tower, the blades, the hub and the nacelle. The rules will be
tightened every six months, Gamesa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
