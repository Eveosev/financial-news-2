The following table details the expected
annual year-over-year share-weighted earnings growth for industry
groups in the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 Index.  Percentages are calculated using Bloomberg earnings estimates
for the current period compared with actual figures from a year ago.
Companies are then grouped together by industry and summed for each
period to calculate the percentage growth.  
NM -- The calculations of percentage changes between profit and loss
and vice versa are not meaningful, hence not calculated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
