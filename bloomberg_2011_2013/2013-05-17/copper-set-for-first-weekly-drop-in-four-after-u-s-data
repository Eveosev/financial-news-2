Copper declined, poised for the first
weekly drop in four, after data showed U.S. jobless claims rose
and housing starts slumped, raising concern that demand from the
second-biggest user is slowing.  Metal for delivery in three months fell as much as 0.6
percent to $7,234 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and
was at $7,254 at 9:44 a.m. in  Shanghai . Copper has retreated 1.7
percent this week, the first drop since the week ended April 19.  More Americans than projected filed claims for jobless
benefits last week and manufacturing in the Philadelphia region
unexpectedly shrank in May, yesterday’s data showed.  “U.S. data overnight weighed on  market sentiment ,” He
Shan, an analyst at Galaxy Futures Co., said by phone from
Beijing. “Now that we’re in the middle of the second quarter, a
seasonal consumption boom in China may be behind us.”  The September futures contract on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 0.5 percent to 52,390  yuan  ($8,534) a ton, as July
futures on the Comex in New York traded little changed at
$3.2910 a pound.  On the LME, zinc and nickel gained.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
