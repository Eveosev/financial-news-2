Accenture Plc (ACN) , the world’s second-largest technology-consulting company, said it will buy  Acquity
Group Ltd. (AQ)  for $316 million to add tools for digital marketing.  The offer of $13 a share is more than double Acquity’s
closing price yesterday of $5.96. The acquisition would help
Accenture boost sales to clients’ marketing divisions, the
company said in a statement yesterday. Acquity had $141 million
in revenue in 2012.  Acquity, based in Hong Kong, would be combined with
Accenture Interactive, a division started four years ago to
cater to chief marketing officers’ need to measure performance
and develop Internet plans.  “It’s a very important strategic initiative for Accenture
to be delivering to the CMO,” said Glen Hartman, who runs the
interactive division, in an interview. “The CMO may even help
pace technology spending in the next five years. Our clients
asked us to get into this business.”  Accenture, incorporated in Dublin, gained 2 percent to
$82.24 yesterday in  New York . The shares have gained 24 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
