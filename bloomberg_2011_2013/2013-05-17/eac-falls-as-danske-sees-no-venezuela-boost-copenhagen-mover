EAC A/S (EAC) ,  Venezuela ’s biggest meat
producer, fell to the lowest price in 11 weeks in Copenhagen
after Danske Bank A/S said a change of political leadership
isn’t improving conditions in the South American country.  EAC fell as much as 3.1 percent to 95 kroner, the lowest
since Feb. 27. The stock declined 2.6 percent to 95.50 kroner at
10:28 a.m. in the Danish capital, with trading volume at 33
percent of the three-month daily average.  EAC gained 5.8 percent in the first quarter as President
 Hugo Chavez ’s reign, which included currency controls and the
seizure of more than 1,000 companies, came to an end. Nicolas
Maduro, whom Chavez mentored, won the April 14 elections, which
were followed by protests and threats against Spanish companies
including Repsol SA. Opposition leader Henrique Capriles
Radonski is contesting the results in court.  Danske has “abandoned the inclusion of a more benign
Venezuelan scenario after the presidential election,” the bank
said today in a note to client. The Copenhagen-based lender
lowered its recommendation on the share to sell from hold, and
cut its price estimate to 85 kroner from 105 kroner.  Danske also cited poor performance by Copenhagen-based
EAC’s moving division in the first quarter for its lower
recommendation. The unit reported a loss before interest and tax
of 4 million kroner ($0.7 million) compared with a profit by the
same measure of 16 million kroner a year earlier, according to a
statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
