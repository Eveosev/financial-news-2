Copper futures rose for the second
straight day after inventories dropped to a seven-month low in
 China , the world’s biggest consumer of industrial metal, while
U.S.  consumer confidence  rose to the highest since 2007.  Stockpiles of refined copper monitored by the Shanghai
Futures Exchange fell to 190,330 metric tons, the lowest since
October, data showed today. The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan sentiment index rose to 83.7 in May, compared with 76.4
in April and the 77.9 median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
economists. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of equities climbed
to a record.  “If inventories are going down, that’s a good sign,” Matt Zeman, a strategist at Kingsview Financial in  Chicago , said in a
telephone interview. “It looks like the market may have
bottomed, and some of the enthusiasm from equities is spilling
over into copper.”  Copper futures for July delivery climbed 0.9 percent to
settle at $3.323 a pound at 1:11 p.m. on the Comex in  New York ,
capping a two-day rally of 1.8 percent. The U.S. is the second-biggest consumer of the metal.  This week, the price declined 0.9 percent, ending a three-week advance. Futures have dropped 9 percent this year.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose 0.3 percent to $7,305 a ton ($3.31 a pound). Zinc,
tin and lead gained, while aluminum and nickel dropped.  To contact the reporters on this story:
