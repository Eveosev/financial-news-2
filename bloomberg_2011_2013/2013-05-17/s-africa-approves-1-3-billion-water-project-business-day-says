South Africa  approved the 12 billion
rand ($1.3 billion) second phase of the  Lesotho  Highlands Water
Project to boost supplies and generate hydropower, Water and
Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa told  Business Day .  The expansion will supply an extra 45.5 cubic meters (1,600
cubic feet) of water a second to South Africa, from 24.6 cubic
meters now, and generate 1,000 megawatts of electricity for
Lesotho, the newspaper cited the ministry as saying. The project
is scheduled to be completed by August 2020, Business Day said.  The extra water will be used for development including new
mines in Lephalale, the largest municipality in South Africaâ€™s
Limpopo province, and infrastructure projects in Steelpoort in
the same region, Molewa told Business Day. Tenders for work on
the project are expected in late 2013 or early 2014, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
