Canada  registered a 5.2 magnitude
earthquake in southwestern  Quebec  today that swayed buildings
420 kilometers (261 miles) away in Toronto.  The earthquake struck Shawville, Quebec, about 80
kilometers west of the nation’s capital Ottawa, at 9:43 a.m.,
Natural Resources Canada  said  on its website. An aftershock of
4.1 magnitude struck nearby Braeside, Ontario about 10 minutes
later.  “I could feel my computer moving and the floor was
moving,” said Anish Chopra, a  fund manager  with TD Asset
Management Ltd. in Toronto who helps manage C$204 billion ($198
billion) with the firm. Chopra works on the 33rd floor of
Brookfield Place in Toronto.  John Adams , a seismologist with Earthquakes Canada in
Ottawa, said he received reports of tremors as far away as
Waterloo, Ontario and in Ohio.  “This is a moderate quake,” Adams said on the phone from
Ottawa. “We wouldn’t expect damage from this unless you were
right on top of it, and even then only minor damage, like
cracked plaster.”  A 6.0 magnitude quake, by comparison, is about 30 times the
energy and 10 times the sideways motion, he said.  There is about a 2 percent chance that this earthquake
could signal a further, larger event, Adams said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
