Lanxess AG (LXS) , the chemical maker that
joined Germany’s benchmark DAX index in September, jumped the
most in more than five weeks after  Michelin & Cie. (ML)  said European
demand for tires expanded in April.  Lanxess rose as much as 6.2 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since April 10, to 56.99 euros. Industrywide passenger-car
tire volume rose 3 percent from a year earlier for original
equipment and 5 percent for replacement products, Clermont-Ferrand, France-based Michelin, the region’s biggest tiremaker,
said today in an online statement.  The tire and auto industries  generate  40 percent of sales
at Leverkusen, Germany-based Lanxess, whose products include
synthetic rubber. European car sales rose for the first time in
19 months in April, propelled by rebounds in  Germany  and  Spain ,
according to industry figures published today.  The chemical maker’s first-quarter profit dropped 53
percent after European car sales slid to a 20-year low in the
period. Lanxess stock reached a 14-month  trough  last month after
the company predicted a drop in profit that was steeper than the
decline estimated by analysts, and announced the idling of two
factories for a period of several weeks.  Lanxess was trading up 5.5 percent at 56.60 euros at 1:07
p.m. in Frankfurt. The amount of shares exceeded the three-month
daily volume by 37 percent. The company has a market value of
4.71 billion euros ($6.06 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
