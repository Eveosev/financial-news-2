One of the dumbest corporate governance issues is whether to split the roles of Board Chair and CEO. That debate is now playing out on the front pages of business sections (print and online) as shareholders will decide next week in a  nonbinding vote  whether to take the chairman of the board title away from JP Morgan CEO  Jamie Dimon . This is a reprise, for the zillionth time, of the pointless push by governance types to call the senior director "chairman of the board" rather than "lead" or "presiding" director and to deny the CEO the chairman of the board title. (Dimon, of course, is today Chairman of the Board and CEO of JP Morgan;  Lee Raymond  is JPM's "lead" director.) 
What is lost in virtually all  stories  and commentary hyping the Dimon election is an answer to the basic question: what is the function of the lead director? It is this issue of function, not form (i.e., what title that senior director carries), which is crucial. 
It has been a governance verity, if not always a reality, that a strong board should provide oversight and constructive criticism to the CEO and other company leaders. 
Since Enron, this basic principle has been implemented in most companies by designating one director to be first among equals, whatever her title. That director performs at least the following core roles (as I have discussed in detail  elsewhere ): If these are the core functions of the director as first among equals, then whether that director is called "Chairman of the Board" or "Lead Director" or "Presiding Director" doesn't matter. This is a critical  internal  position, not an  external  one. And if the top director needs to speak or meet in public on rare occasions, the  role  of senior director, not the title, provides foundational credibility. Function, not form, is what matters. What also matters, of course, is  who  the director is in that lead role. Does she have the respect of the board? Does she have the respect of the CEO and top business leaders? Does he have the skills to carry out the functions to provide proper oversight and guidance without micro-managing? The wrong director as  "chairman of the board" won't carry out the key functions properly. The right person as "lead director" (who actually  leads ) will discharge the functions effectively. The personal qualities of that senior director, not her title, are everything. Any substantive issues with CEO Dimon or current JPM lead director Lee Raymond aren't going to be fixed by changing Raymond's title to Chairman of the Board, and taking that title away from Dimon. The vote on the shareholder proposal to strip Dimon of the Chairman tile may be an indirect way of chastising him for past mistakes (most prominently the losses due to the trades of the  "London Whale" ), but it has nothing to do with the proper functions of the senior director in the future. Indeed, this dust-up symbolizes one of the failings of the governance movement: a tendency to focus on formalism rather than  substance.
