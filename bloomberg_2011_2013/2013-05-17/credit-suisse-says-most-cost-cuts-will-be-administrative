Credit Suisse Group AG’s job cuts
have created a “sustainable business model” and future cost
savings will be sought in “our shared services and platform-type costs,” Chief Executive Officer  Brady Dougan  said.  Those areas, which include administrative functions and
technology, are “where the bulk of the cost reductions going
forward will come from,” Dougan said today in an interview on
CNBC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
