Hedge-fund managers and other  large
speculators  held a net-short position in 10-year note futures
for the first time in almost two months amid speculation Federal
Reserve officials may taper the pace of asset purchases.  They moved to the bearish wagers in the week ending May 14
for the first time since March 22, according to U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data. Speculative short positions, or
bets prices will fall, outnumbered long positions by 11,153
contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade. The previous week,
traders were net-long 37,956 contracts.  “There’s a lot of talk right now of tapering starting
sooner than later,” said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate
strategist in New York at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, one of 21
primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “If the Fed does come
out and say they will be tapering, the first reaction would be
higher yields.”  The Fed said after a policy meeting on May 1 it will
maintain stimulus as long as the outlook for inflation doesn’t
exceed 2.5 percent and as unemployment remains above 6.5
percent. Fed policy makers meet on June 18-19. The central bank
will release minutes of the April 30 to May 1 policy makers
meeting on May 22.  The yield on the 10-year note has risen for three
consecutive weeks, from 1.66 percent on April 26, in the longest
stretch of increases since December. The yield rose seven basis
points today to 1.95 percent in  New York .  To contact the reporters on this story:
