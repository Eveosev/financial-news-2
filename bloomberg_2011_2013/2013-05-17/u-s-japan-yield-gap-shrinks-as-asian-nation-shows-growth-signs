The extra yield investors demand to
hold 10-year notes in the U.S. instead of  Japan  was within one
basis point of the narrowest level since January as the Asian
nation’s economy expands faster than analyst expected.  The  difference  was 1.0409 percentage points, versus 1.0398
percentage points earlier this month, which was the smallest
spread since Jan. 14. Japan’s  machine orders  rose 14.2 percent
in March from February, versus a gain of 3.5 percent projected
by a Bloomberg News survey of economists, data today showed.
Gross domestic product rose 3.5 percent at an annualized pace in
the first quarter, the most in a year, figures showed yesterday.  “The Japanese economy is awakening,” said Kazuaki Oh’e, a
debt salesman in  Tokyo  at CIBC World Markets Japan Inc., a unit
of  Canada ’s fifth-largest lender. “Yields are up. The U.S.
inflation rate is very low. Rates are going to be stable.”  U.S. 10-year  rates  were little changed at 1.88 percent as
of 10:19 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data.
The price of the 1.75 percent security due in May 2023 was 98
26/32.  Japan’s 10-year yield fell as much as three basis points
today to 0.81 percent. It was as high as 0.92 percent earlier in
the week. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Treasuries rose yesterday, pushing yields lower, as
government and Federal Reserve reports pointed to a weakening
economy and slower inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
