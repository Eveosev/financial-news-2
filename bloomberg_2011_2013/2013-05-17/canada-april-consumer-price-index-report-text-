The following is the text of
Canada’s  consumer price index  report for April released
by  Statistics Canada .  The Consumer  Price Index  (CPI) rose 0.4% in the 12 months
to April, following a 1.0% increase in March. Declining gasoline
prices were largely responsible for the 0.6 percentage point
difference in the 12-month change in the CPI. Price decreases
for the purchase of passenger vehicles were also a factor.  Gasoline prices decreased 6.0% on a year-over-year basis in
April, after falling 0.3% in March. The decrease in April was
the largest year-over-year decline in gasoline prices since
October 2009.  Excluding gasoline, the CPI rose 0.8% in the 12 months to
April, following a 1.1% increase in March.  12-month change in the major components  The shelter and food components were the main upward
contributors to the rise in the CPI, while the transportation
component was the main downward contributor.  Shelter costs increased 1.3% in the 12 months to April,
following a 1.1% rise in March. Electricity prices and rent
advanced year over year, while mortgage interest cost decreased
4.3%.  Food prices increased 1.5% on a year-over-year basis in
April, after increasing 1.8% in March. Consumers paid more for
food purchased from stores, as prices for meat rose 3.2%. In
contrast, prices for sugar and confectionery declined 2.8%.  Consumers paid 1.2% more for food purchased from
restaurants in the 12 months to April, following a 2.2% increase
in March. The smaller increase in April compared with March was
largely attributable to price declines in British Columbia.  Transportation costs declined 2.1% in the 12 months to
April, after posting no change the previous month. In addition
to price decreases for gasoline, prices for the purchase of
passenger vehicles declined 0.7% year over year in April, after
rising 0.8% in March.  12-month change in the provinces  Consumer prices rose in eight provinces in the 12 months to
April. The exceptions were New Brunswick and British Columbia,
where consumer prices declined. The largest increases were
registered in Prince  Edward Island  and Manitoba.  Chart: Consumer prices increase the most in Prince Edward Island

price decreases were posted in Newfoundland and Labrador and
 Nova Scotia  (both -9.3%), while the smallest were recorded in
Manitoba (-0.4%) and Prince Edward Island (-2.7%).  On April 1, 2013, the Harmonized Sales Tax came into effect
in Prince Edward Island, while British Columbia returned to the
Provincial Sales Tax and the Goods and Services Tax.  In Prince Edward Island, consumer prices rose 1.8% in the
12 months to April, after registering a 1.2% advance in March.

increase among the provinces for clothing.  Prices in British Columbia fell 0.8% in the 12 months to
April, after rising 0.5% in March. Consumers paid 4.3% less for
food purchased from restaurants.  Consumer prices in Manitoba rose 1.8% on a year-over-year
basis in April, following a 2.3% increase in March. Manitoba had
the smallest year-over-year decrease in gasoline prices among
the provinces.  In  New Brunswick , consumer prices decreased 0.2% year over
year in April, following a 0.8% increase the previous month.
