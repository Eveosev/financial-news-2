Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said his nation has reservations that prevent an
imminent conclusion of an updated European Union savings tax
accord, signalling EU leaders may not be ready to secure more
commitments on anti-tax-evasion efforts at a May 22 summit.  Juncker said Luxembourg already has taken a big step by
agreeing to introduce automatic tax information exchange in
2015, a move that it had long resisted. Luxembourg also signed
on to last week’s agreement by finance ministers to pursue talks
with Switzerland and four other nations, while saying it
couldn’t approve the updated savings tax deal until after talks
with the five countries conclude.  “We won’t go beyond that line next week,” Juncker said in
an interview with RTL radio, according to a transcript published
on the Luxembourg government website today.  He said pressure to move more quickly was coming from
France and that he planned to speak with French President
 Francois Hollande  ahead of next week’s summit in Brussels.  To contact the reporters on this story:
