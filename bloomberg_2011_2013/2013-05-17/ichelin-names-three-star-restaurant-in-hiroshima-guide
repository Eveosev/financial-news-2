Michelin (ML)  awarded three stars to
Nakashima restaurant in Hiroshima in the inaugural guide to the
city and neighboring area in western  Japan .  There were two stars for five establishments: Ajiyoshi,
Kodama, Sazanka, Tenko Honten and Tokaan. Another 24 restaurants
won a single star. The inspectors said cooking standards in
Hiroshima were high and based on top-quality ingredients.  “Their travels enabled them to discover gastronomy that is
rooted in Japanese tradition as well as local culinary
specialties like anago (salt-water eels) and okonomiyaki
(Japanese crepe),” Michelin said today in an e-mailed release.  Michelin is generous with its stars in Japan, with Tokyo
outstripping Paris for three-star establishments. The new guide
follows separate volumes for the  Tokyo  and Osaka regions.  Three stars mean exceptional cuisine, worth a special
journey; two are for excellent cooking, worth a detour; one
denotes a very good restaurant in its category. The tire maker
has produced restaurant and hotel guides since 1900. They were
originally intended for chauffeurs and included motoring tips.  (Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
