Andy Warhol ’s 1962 silkscreen
painting “Four Marilyns” sold for $38.2 million at Phillips in
New York Thursday night, the top price in a $78.6 contemporary-art sale that concluded two weeks of semi-annual evening
auctions.  The tally for the auction barely exceeded its presale low
estimate of $77.5 million and was well below the high target of
$105.5 million; last May’s tally was $86.9 million.  Seven of the 37 lots failed to find buyers. A dozen lots
were guaranteed to sell by Phillips, a third party or a
combination thereof.  “The sale was measured,” said New York art adviser Mary
Hoeveler. “People spent a lot of money in the preceding
auctions.”  Christie’s recorded the highest auction tally in history
the night before with $495 million and set 12 artist records,
including milestones for  Jackson Pollock ,  Roy Lichtenstein  and
 Jean-Michel Basquiat .  Earlier in the week,  Sotheby’s (BID)  sold about $300 million of
art, establishing records for Barnett Newman and  Gerhard Richter .  No artist records were set at Phillips, which is owned by
the Russian retailer Mercury Group. Many seats were empty in the
muted Manhattan salesroom.  Simon de Pury, the company’s theatrical co-founder and
longtime chief auctioneer, left the firm last year. His place
was taken by a youthful Alexander Gilkes, co-founder of  Paddle8 ,
who steered things along at a brisk pace, wrapping up the sale
in less than an hour.  Shifting Estimate  “Four Marilyns” was consigned by an anonymous collector.
The estimate -- offered upon request -- was $35 million to $50
million, according to  Michael McGinnis , Phillips’s chief
executive officer. The high end of the range was later changed
to $45 million.  “It’s a fluid thing, the estimate upon request,” he said
after the auction.  Three bidders vied for the painting by Warhol, whose
auction record of $71.7 million was set in 2007. The winner was
Victoria Gelfand-Magalhaes of  Gagosian  gallery, who was bidding
for a client on the phone.  The 29-by-21-inch canvas depicts four almost identical
Marilyn Monroe heads: two on the top, two on the bottom. The
images are set against a cadmium-orange background and depict
the actress with lavender skin, turquoise eye-shadow and yellow
hair.  The image was based on a 1952 publicity still promoting the
film “Niagara.” Underlying the painting’s iconic quality is
the fact that it was done shortly after the star’s death.  The same work sold for $2.3 million in 1998 at Sotheby’s in
New York. In 1992, it sold for $955,399 at Sotheby’s  London .  Few Blockbusters  “Four Marilyns” was the most expensive Warhol of this
season, which saw fewer blockbuster pieces by the late Pop
artist than previous years. Warhol ranked first among the top 25
artists by auction revenue in 2012. His works sold for a total
of $380.3 million last year, according to  Artnet .  Few lots surpassed their high estimates at the Phillips
sale.  Jeff Koons ’s 1986 sculpture “ Jim Beam  -- Observation
Car,” made with stainless steel and bourbon, sold for $1.6
million, short of the $1.8 million target. Elsworth Kelly’s 1968
painting “Green Black” went for $2.9 million, also shy of the
high estimate of $3.5 million.  Lichtenstein’s 1972 “Still Life,” depicting a bowl with
grapes and an apple, fetched $4.1 million, just squeezing past
the low estimate of $4 million. Prices include the buyer’s
premium; estimates do not.  Nate Lowman’s “Escalade” (2005-2007) sold for $545,000
against the estimate of $400,000 to $600,000. Earlier this week,
a similar piece sold for $665,000 at Sotheby’s, setting an
auction record for the artist.  The biggest casualty was a 1983-84 painting and collage on
canvas, “Untitled (Soap)” by Basquiat. Estimated at $5 million
to $7 million, it failed to attract a single bid.  “I am sad the Basquiat didn’t sell,” said Courtney Love,
pulling out a pack of cigarettes after the auction. “Marilyn
was a little overrated.”  She declined to say whether she bought anything.  “I collect sporadically and mostly women artists,” said
the rocker, dressed in a skin-toned and skin-tight Roland Mouret
dress. “Generally I bid by phone.”  Muse highlights include Farah Nayeri on Cannes  films ,
 Richard Vines  on dining.  To contact the reporters of this story:
