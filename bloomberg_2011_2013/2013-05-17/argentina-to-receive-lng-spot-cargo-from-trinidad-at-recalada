Argentina , which has no long-term
contracts to import liquefied natural gas, is scheduled to
receive a spot cargo of the fuel from Trinidad & Tobago today,
according to ship-tracking data.  The SCF Polar, with a capacity of about 71,500 cubic
meters, will arrive at the port of Recalada near Buenos Aires,
according to ship transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on
Bloomberg. The vessel sailed from Atlantic LNG Co.’s Point
Fortin terminal, where it loaded the supercooled natural gas and
departed May 5, the data show.  Argentina imports LNG through YPF SA, the country’s largest
energy company, and state-run Energia Argentina SA, known as
Enarsa. Nobody answered two calls to YPF’s main switchboard in
 Buenos Aires  outside normal business hours, and Enarsa officials
didn’t respond to e-mails seeking comment.  Two calls to Atlantic LNG’s main switchboard in Port of
Spain weren’t answered outside normal working hours.  YPF last week closed a tender to buy seven LNG cargoes for
delivery to Bahia Blanca. Enarsa and YPF have issued seven spot
purchase tenders seeking as many as 150 shipments since
December.  Latin America’s LNG import capacity will increase to 49.2
million metric tons a year in 2020 from a projected 30 million
this year, Anton Safronov,  Total SA’s (FP)  LNG origination director,
said May 9 in Singapore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
