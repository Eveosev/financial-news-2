Diamond prices will rise an average 6
percent a year through 2020 as tight supply is unable to meet
growing demand in  China  and  India , BMO Capital Markets said.  While output is rising, it’s unlikely to surpass the peak
of about 160 million carats a year attained before the world
financial crisis, BMO analyst Edward Sterck said in a report.  “The primary constraint on supply growth is the lack of
new discoveries that match the scale of existing operations in
 Botswana  and  Russia ,” Sterck said. “Given expanding demand and
constrained supply, diamond prices are likely to increase as
consumers compete for an increasingly scarce commodity.”  Producers have struggled to find large new mines. Output at
many of the biggest mines is falling as supplies of accessible
diamonds near the surface are depleted. De Beers, the largest
producer by revenue, opened the Orapa mine in Botswana in 1971,
and its Jwaneng project, the largest diamond mine by production
value, and Rio Tinto Group’s Argyle started up in 1982.  The last major mine to start up was Rio’s Diavik in 2003.  China surpassed  Japan  in 2011 to become the biggest diamond
consuming nation behind the U.S, while sales in India gained 17
percent. Buyers in China and India made up about 20 percent of
global demand in 2011 and that will rise to 28 percent in 2016
as the market grows to $31 billion from $23 billion, according
to  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , owner of De Beers.  Rough diamond prices, up about 9 percent this year, will
stay at current levels for the rest of 2013 before beginning to
increase next year, BMO said. Prices fell 16 percent last year
after three straight gains of more than 20 percent, according to
data compiled by WWW International Diamond Consultants Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
