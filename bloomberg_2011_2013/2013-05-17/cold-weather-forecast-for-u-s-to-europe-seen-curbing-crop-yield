The U.S. and Europe may see colder
and wetter conditions for the next 25 to 30 years, curbing
yields for grain farmers, said Piers Corbyn, managing director
of London-based WeatherAction.  Western Europe will be “largely wet and cold and lousy”
through September, Corbyn said today at a Grain & Feed Trade
Association conference in Geneva. The U.S. may see wetter-than-normal conditions in June before the Midwest and eastern U.S.
get extreme heat in July and August, preliminary forecasts show,
he said. Solar activity and movements in the jet stream mean a
“mini ice age” is beginning, similar to a weather pattern
experienced in the early 1800s, he said.  Long term “the whole Northern Hemisphere will see longer
winters with more snow, and more severe storms,” Corbyn said in
an interview after his speech. “There will be shorter summers
and late, cold springs. The growing implications are that
farmers will start to plant more root crops, and there will be
lower yields for people who do stick with grains.”  The U.K. had its second-coldest year on record last year,
according to the Met Office, spurring a 13 percent drop in the
country’s wheat production. The U.S. had its worst drought since
the 1930s. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has predicted  corn 
production from the next harvest will jump 31 percent from last
year to a record 14.14 billion bushels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
