Rubber climbed as European car sales
expanded for the first time in 19 months, easing concern that
ailing economies in the region will curb demand for the
commodity used in tires.  Rubber for delivery in October gained 2 percent to settle
at 287.8 yen a kilogram ($2,807 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange, reversing an earlier decline of as much as
1.8 percent. The rally pared this week’s losses for the most-active contract to 2 percent.  Car registrations in April increased 1.8 percent to 1.08
million vehicles from 1.06 million cars a year earlier, the
Brussels-based European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association,
or ACEA, said today in a statement. Four-month sales fell 7
percent to 4.18 million vehicles.  “Expanding auto sales will support demand for rubber,”
said Takaki Shigemoto, analyst at research company JSC Corp.  Car sales in  Europe  last month rose the most at Daimler AG,
with an 11 percent jump propelled by a 13 percent increase at
the Mercedes-Benz luxury brand.  Thai rubber free-on-board dropped 0.2 percent to 88.85 baht
($2.98) a kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand . The nation, the biggest producer and
exporter, is targeting a price of 110 baht a kilogram for this
year and 2014, according to Thai Agriculture and Agricultural
Cooperatives agency.  Rubber for delivery in September on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 3.1 percent to 20,595  yuan  ($3,353) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
