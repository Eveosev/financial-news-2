The Pentagon cleared  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
devices for use on its networks, setting the stage for the maker
of iPhones and iPads to compete with Samsung Electronics Co. and
BlackBerry for military sales.  The Defense Department today approved the use of Cupertino,
California-based Apple’s products running a version of the iOS 6
mobile platform.  The decision eventually may spur a three-way fight for a
market long dominated by Waterloo, Ontario-based BlackBerry. The
Pentagon on May 2 approved Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung’s
devices, as well as BlackBerry 10 smartphones and BlackBerry
PlayBook tablets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
