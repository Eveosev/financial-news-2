Eurasian Natural Resources Corp.’s
three founding shareholders sent a letter with details of a
planned bid for the company at a price of less than 300 pence a
share to its independent committee of directors, according to
people familiar with the matter.  The founders, who said April 19 they have formed a group
with the Kazakh government to consider a takeover, will probably
seek an extension of the deadline for making a formal proposal,
the people said, asking not to be identified because the
information isn’t public.  ENRC founders  Alexander Machkevitch , Patokh Chodiev and
Alijan Ibragimov, together with the Kazakh government, are
considering taking the company private, Machkevitch said last
month. The group, which owns 54 percent of ENRC, was given until
today to make a formal proposal.  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ) , Kazakhstan’s
biggest copper producer, owns 26 percent of ENRC.  Representatives of the bidder group, ENRC and the
independent committee of directors all declined to comment.  ENRC’s assets include  iron ore , ferroalloy and power
production operations in Kazakhstan, copper and cobalt
businesses in Africa and a Brazilian iron ore project.  The company traces its roots to the founders’ participation
in the 1990s privatizations of Kazakh state assets, which were
gradually combined into a single group of companies and listed
in  London  in 2007.  To contact the reporters on this story:
