Keegan Bradley holds a two-shot lead
during today’s second round of the U.S. PGA Tour’s Byron Nelson
Championship, a day after setting a course record with a 10-under-par 60.  Tom Gillis is at 8-under after a second-round score of 63,
which included eight birdies and a bogey today at the TPC Four
Seasons Resort in Las Colinas,  Texas . Gillis, who shot 1-under
69 in the first round, had a chance to tie Bradley for the lead
with a birdie on his final hole. Instead, he three-putted from 9
feet away for his lone bogey.  Bradley, 26, became the second player this year to shoot 60
in a PGA Tour event, after  Phil Mickelson  in the first round of
the Phoenix event on Jan. 31. He’s the 28th player to achieve
the feat in tour history. Five golfers have shot 59 in a PGA
Tour event.  Bradley, who begins his second round this afternoon, beat
the previous course record by one shot. The American won in his
first visit to the Byron Nelson Championship in 2011 and is
seeking his fourth PGA Tour title after also winning the 2011
 PGA Championship  and the Bridgestone Invitational, a World Golf
Championships event, last year.  Charl Schwartzel, the 2011 Masters Tournament winner from
 South Africa , is tied with John Huh of the U.S. for third at 7
under. Huh is 6 under today through 15 holes, while Schwartzel
resumes play this afternoon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
