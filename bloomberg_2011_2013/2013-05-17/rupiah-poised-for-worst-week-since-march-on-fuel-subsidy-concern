  Indonesia ’s bonds fell this week,
pushing the 10-year yield up by the most since August, and the
rupiah declined on speculation the nation’s lack of progress in
cutting fuel subsidies will spur outflows.  President  Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  on April 30 made an
increase in the gasoline price contingent on parliament
approving a compensation package for the poor, which still
hasn’t been submitted. The current-account  shortfall  narrowed to
$5.27 billion last quarter, from $7.65 billion in the previous
period, as the economy expanded by the least in more than two
years, central bank data show.  “The current-account deficit narrowed for the wrong reason,
which is slowing growth,” said Leo Rinaldy, a Jakarta-based
economist at PT Mandiri Sekuritas, a unit of the nation’s
largest lender by assets. “The market will punish Indonesia if
it fails to hike fuel prices, which would improve the current
account in a structural way and for the right reasons.”  The yield on sovereign notes due May 2023 climbed 14 basis
points, or 0.14 percentage point, this week to 5.58 percent as
of 4:15 p.m. in Jakarta, the most since the five days ended Aug.
31, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show. The
rate gained three basis points today.  Pictet Asset Management and PT Manulife Asset Management
Indonesia said this week they are bracing for declines in the
nation’s bonds as elections next year limit the chance of the
government increasing subsidized-fuel prices.  The rupiah fell 0.2 percent this week to 9,757 per dollar,
the most since the five days ended April 5, prices from local
banks compiled by Bloomberg show. It reached 9,845 earlier, the
weakest level since Jan. 10, and advanced 0.4 percent today.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose 54 basis points
this week to 6.56 percent. It gained 15 basis points today and
touched 7.21 percent earlier, the highest since Sept. 4, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
