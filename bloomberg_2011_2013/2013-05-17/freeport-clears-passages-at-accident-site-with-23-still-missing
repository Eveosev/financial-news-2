(Corrects date of accident in second paragraph.)  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) 
said it has cleared two passages to allow heavy machinery access
to the site of a mining accident in Indonesia where 23 workers
are still missing.  Five people were killed in the May 14 collapse of a tunnel
at the Grasberg complex in Papua province. Ten survivors are in
stable condition, Phoenix-based Freeport’s Indonesian unit said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Work at Grasberg, the world’s second-largest copper mine,
has been halted. Freeport said it doesn’t expect a
“significant” impact from the accident on its operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
