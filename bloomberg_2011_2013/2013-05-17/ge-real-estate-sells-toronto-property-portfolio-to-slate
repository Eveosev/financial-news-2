GE Capital  Real Estate, a unit of
General Electric Co., sold 79 factories and office buildings in
Toronto, encompassing all of its real estate in the city, to
closely held Slate Properties Inc.  “The sale is consistent with our strategy to optimize our
equity portfolio and to sell into strong markets,” Nancy
Nyikes, a spokeswoman for GE Capital Real Estate, said in a
telephone interview from  St. Louis . She declined to disclose the
sale price. The purchase by  Slate , a Toronto-based real estate
investor, was completed on May 15, she said.  GE Capital Real Estate, based in Norwalk,  Connecticut , is
expanding its debt business and reducing the size of its equity
holdings, Nyikes said. The unit has a $2 billion mortgage
portfolio and plans to originate $1 billion in  Canada  this year,
she said. This month, it sold seven Australian office properties
to Sydney-based Mirvac Group.  The Toronto buildings have 6.2 million square feet (576,000
square meters) of space. GE Capital Real Estate has 22 buildings
remaining in Canada, according to Nyikes.  GE Capital’s real estate holdings contributed $1.66 billion
to its first-quarter revenue, up 98 percent from a year earlier,
General Electric said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
