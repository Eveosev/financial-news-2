Cielo SA (CIEL3) ,  Brazil ’s biggest processor
of credit-card payments, declined the most in seven months after
a lawmaker proposed a bill to curb fees that the industry
charges.  The shares dropped 4.4 percent to 52.70 reais at the close
of trading in Sao Paulo, the biggest one-day slump since Oct.
23. Trading volume was 3.7 times the three-month daily average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the worst
performer on Brazil’s benchmark  Ibovespa (IBOV)  index, which added 0.7
percent.  Lawmaker Aloysio Nunes Ferreira of Sao Paulo, senate leader
of Brazil’s biggest opposition party, proposed on May 15 a bill
that would limit charges by card processors and allows retailers
to offer discounts to clients who pay with cash instead of
plastic.  “We believe any changes proposed from such bill are remote
in the short- to medium-term,”  Mario Pierry , an analyst at
Deutsche Bank AG, wrote in a note to clients today.
“Nonetheless, it reinforces our views that regulatory risks in
the industry are high and should not be ignored.”  The proposal is awaiting the designation of a sponsor who
can present the bill to the committee responsible for economic
matters, according to the senator’s website.  Today’s decline pared Cielo’s advance this year to 11
percent, compared with an 9.5 percent drop in the Ibovespa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
