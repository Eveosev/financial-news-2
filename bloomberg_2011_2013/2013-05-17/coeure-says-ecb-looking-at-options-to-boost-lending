European Central Bank Executive Board
member Benoit Coeure said while the ECB is looking at options to
spur lending to smaller companies it shouldn’t artificially
change risk premiums paid by such firms.  “The ECB is today exploring options to further strengthen
lending to the real economy and, in particular, to small and
medium-sized enterprises,” Coeure said in a speech in Orleans,
 France , today. At the same time, “seeking to artificially
eliminate differences in financing costs arising from different
risk environment or from insufficient capital would amount to
substituting actions not taken by other actors,” he said.  The Frankfurt-based central bank on May 2 cut its  benchmark
interest rate  to a record low of 0.5 percent and President Mario Draghi said the ECB is exploring options to rekindle the market
for asset-backed securities to support lending to smaller
companies. Still, policy makers are “far from reaching any
conclusion,” he said.  “The ECB can only act within its mandate,” Coeure said.
Reducing risk premiums or assuming non-profitable assets from
banks’ balance sheets “would be to the detriment of the central
bank’s independence and freedom of action,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
