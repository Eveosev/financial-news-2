Japan ’s  Topix Index (TPX)  closed at its
highest since August 2008, led by leasing companies on a report
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will encourage the practice as part of
his growth strategy.  Orix Corp. (8591) , which provides leasing and loans, jumped 9.2
percent. Mizuno Corp. soared 18 percent after the sportswear
company more than doubled its net-income forecast. A gauge
tracking agricultural stocks climbed to the highest since 2008
on a separate report that Abe plans to double the industry’s
income in a decade.  Sony Corp. (6758)  dropped 1.7 percent after Japan’s
biggest exporter of consumer electronics surged 19 percent over
the past five trading days.  The Topix added 0.6 percent to close at 1,253.24 in Tokyo,
the highest since Aug. 29, 2008, after falling as much as 0.7
percent. The gauge capped a 3.5 percent gain this week. The
 Nikkei 225  Stock Average rose 0.7 percent to 15,138.12 today.
Gains were limited amid signs the market may be overheating.  “Leasing companies continue to draw attention as they
surge on a report about the government’s growth strategy,” said
Takashi Aoki, a Tokyo-based  fund manager  at Mizuho Asset
Management Co., which oversees about 3.4 trillion yen ($33
billion). “The market is trading in a tight range as profit-taking takes place while investors buy on dips.”  The Topix has risen 46 percent this year, outperforming all
major equity indexes amid unprecedented easing from the  Bank of
Japan . The gauge traded at 1.3 times book value, compared with
about 2.4 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.7 for the
Stoxx  Europe  600 Index.  Abe Strategy  Abe will encourage leasing to revive  capital spending  to a
level last seen before the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., the Nikkei newspaper said without citing anyone. The prime
minister will outline a growth plan in a speech today after the
market close.  Orix jumped 9.2 percent to 1,638 yen. Mitsubishi UFJ Lease
& Finance Co. surged 17 percent to 597 yen.  Abe’s growth strategies will also include boosting the
agricultural industry and tripling infrastructure exports to
about 30 trillion yen by 2020, public broadcaster NHK reported.  The Topix Fishery, Agriculture & Forestry Index rose 3.5
percent, the biggest gain since Feb. 26. Nippon Suisan Kaisha
Ltd., a maker of seafood products, added 6.3 percent to 219 yen.
Sakata Seed Corp. gained 6.1 percent to 1,530 yen.  Investors are more confident in a Japanese leader than at
any time since at least September 2010. Abe’s policies are
perceived more optimistically than those of his counterparts in
the U.S., Europe and  China , according to a worldwide poll of
investors, analysts and traders who are Bloomberg subscribers.  Overheating Signs  Shares opened lower today after the 14-day  relative
strength index , a measure of trading momentum, held above 70 for
both the Topix and the Nikkei 225 for the past six days. That’s
a level some traders say signals a sell-off.  Sony slid 1.7 percent to 2,046 yen after its 14-day RSI
climbed to 81 yesterday.  Futures on the  S&P 500  added 0.2 percent today. The equity
gauge fell 0.5 percent in  New York  yesterday, halting four days
of record gains. A report showed jobless claims jumped by 32,000
to 360,000 last week, the most since the end of March. Housing
starts slumped 16.5 percent in April, the most since February
2011.  Of the 803 companies on the Topix that have reported full-year earnings since April 1, and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 482 beat analysts’ projections.  Mizuno soared 18 percent to 505 yen, the biggest gain since
1999, after saying net income will more than double to 4.2
billion yen in the current fiscal year.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index fell 0.5 percent
to 26.53, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.6 percent
on the benchmark gauge during the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
