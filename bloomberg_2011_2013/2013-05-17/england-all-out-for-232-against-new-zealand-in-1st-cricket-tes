New Zealand  trails England by 79 runs
in its first innings of the opening Test after reaching 153-4
when bad light stopped play at Lord’s Cricket Ground in London.  Kane Williamson, on 44, and Brendon McCullum, on 1, were
batting when the umpires took the players off on an overcast
day.  Ross Taylor  hit 66 off of 72 balls before he was caught leg
before wicket by  James Anderson , who surpassed 300 career
wickets by going 3-32.  England batted first and slumped to 232 all out as Tim
Southee claimed 4-58. The 24-year-old caught and bowled
England’s top scorer Jonny Bairstow on 41 to end the innings.  England, which started the day on 160-4, lost the wickets
of Joe Root, Matt Prior,  Stuart Broad  and Graeme Swann in the
morning session, with Prior and Broad out without scoring.
Anderson was not out for 7.  New Zealand lost opening batsmen Peter Fulton, caught by
Swann on 2, and Hamish Rutherford, caught by  Alastair Cook  on 4,
cheaply before Taylor and Williamson combined for 93 runs.  The visitors are trying to win their first Test series in
England since 1999, which is also the last time they won at
Lord’s. Neil Wagner took 3-70 for New Zealand, which was also
boosted by two wickets from Trent Boult.  The two-match series continues at Leeds on May 24. The
teams drew 0-0 in their three-match series in New Zealand. They
also will play three one-day Internationals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
