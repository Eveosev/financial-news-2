U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
urged Congress to take action as soon as possible to raise the
debt limit and “remove the threat of default.”  “Congress should act sooner rather than later to protect
America’s good credit and avoid the potentially catastrophic
consequences of failing to act until it is too late,” Lew said
in a letter to Congressional leaders today.  The debt limit has been suspended by Congress until May 18.
The Treasury is implementing extraordinary measures to allow the
U.S. to pay its bills beyond that date, Lew said in the letter.
The maneuvers mean that the limit will not be reached until
after the U.S. Labor Day holiday, which this year falls on Sept.
2, Lew said in the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
