Wesfarmers Ltd. (WES) ,  Australia ’s largest
private-sector employer, fell the most in more than two years in
Sydney trading after it said earnings from its Target department
stores would drop as much as 43 percent from a year earlier.  The  stock  declined 2.9 percent, the most since February
2011, to close at A$42.93. The Perth-based company forecast that
the unit would report earnings before interest and tax of A$140
million ($136 million) to A$160 million in the 12 months ending
June. The business posted Ebit of  A$244 million  in the previous
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Australia’s retail industry has struggled as the strength
of the currency has driven down the cost of imported goods. The
country’s central bank has cut  interest rates  to a record low
2.75 percent amid unemployment that’s risen by  half a percentage
point  to 5.5 percent over the past year. Target had seen poor
sales performance in the second half and higher levels of
shoplifting and stock loss, the company said.  “While Target’s earnings for the current year will be
disappointing, appropriate action has been taken,” Wesfarmers
said in a statement attributed to managing director Richard Goyder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
