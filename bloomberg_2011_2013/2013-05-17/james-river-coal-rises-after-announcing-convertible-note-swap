James River Coal Co. (JRCC) , a producer of
the fuel in the Midwest and Central Appalachia, reached a two-month high after the company agreed to exchange about $243.4
million of convertible bonds for $123.3 million of new notes due
in 2018.  James River gained 9.9 percent to $2.44 at the close in  New
York , the highest since March 15.  The company will exchange $90 million of 4.5 percent notes
due 2015 and $153.4 million 3.125 percent notes due 2018 for new
10 percent senior convertible notes, the Richmond, Virginia-based company said today in a statement.  “The company reduced its 2015 maturities and, given the
challenging coal markets, that’s quite a plus,” Lucas Pipes, a
New York-based analyst at Brean Capital LLC, said by phone.
“The swap essentially gives them additional time to weather out
this current weakness.”  James River  idled five underground mines and reduced output
at other operations after U.S. demand slowed, the company said
March 7. Consumption of the fuel slumped amid mild weather and
competition from natural gas.  James River, which has reported a net loss for the last
seven quarters, had net debt of $451.9 million as of March 31.
The company said May 1 it was evaluating a “wide variety” of
options to improve liquidity and strengthen its balance sheet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
