Asian stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark index advancing for a second week, as  Japan ’s Nikkei
225 Stock Average closed above 15,000 for the first time since
2007 after the yen touched a 4 1/2-year low against the dollar.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker, advanced
6.9 percent, extending its gain for the year to 62 percent. Sony
Corp. jumped 15 percent as activist investor Daniel Loeb pushed
for a partial spinoff of the electronics maker’s entertainment
unit. Tokyo Electric Power Co. soared 40 percent, the biggest
gain on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, on optimism Japan’s nuclear
plants will be restarted. Singapore Airlines Ltd. slumped 4
percent after its fourth-quarter operating loss widened on lower
passenger and cargo fares.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.5 percent to 142.51
this week, its highest weekly close since June 6, 2008. The
measure has risen more than 10 percent this year as the Bank of
Japan started unprecedented monetary easing and policy makers in
the U.S. showed willingness to add stimulus. The  MSCI Asia
Pacific Index excluding Japan  lost 1.1 percent this week.  “The rally, particularly in Japan, may continue as
earnings recover,” said  Daphne Roth , Singapore-based head of
Asia equity research at ABN Amro Private Bank, which oversees
about $207 billion. “I don’t think there’s overheating in the
market. Central banks are still pursuing quantitative easing,
and that’s going to support further gains.”  Technical Indicators  While the MSCI Asia Pacific Index is trading at about 3.8
percent higher than its 50-day  moving average , its 14-day
relative strength index is at 62, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, below the 70 level some investors consider as a sign
the market has risen too far, too fast.  The regional benchmark gauge trades at 14.3 times  estimated
earnings , compared with about 15.1 for the  Standard and Poor’s
500 Index  and 13.5 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan’s  Topix Index (TPX) , the broadest measure of Japanese
stocks, rose 3.5 percent this week to close at a 4 1/2 year high,
while the Nikkei 225 climbed 3.6 percent. Data showed first-quarter gross domestic product and March machinery orders
exceeded estimates.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index slipped 0.5 percent, while
South Korea’s Kospi Index increased 2.2 percent.  The Shanghai Composite Index gained 1.6 percent. Hong
Kong’s Hang Seng Index, which was closed yesterday for a holiday,
lost 1 percent this week. China’s industrial output and fixed-asset investment missed estimates this week, suggesting growth
in the world’s No. 2 economy is slowing.  Japanese Exporters  The yen weakened 1 percent this week, passing 102 against
the dollar. The currency slid after G-7 policy makers signaled
tolerance of its depreciation and economic data suggested
stimulus measures are boosting the economy. The BOJ unveiled a
plan on April 4 to double the amount of currency in circulation
to achieve 2 percent inflation within two years.  Toyota, which gets about 31 percent of revenue from North
America, gained 6.9 percent to 6,470 yen. Canon Inc., the
world’s biggest camera maker, climbed 6.3 percent to 3,780 yen.  Sony surged 15 percent to 2,046 yen, jumping as much as 10
percent on May 15 on reports that Loeb, the company’s biggest
shareholder, proposed taking public part of Sony’s profitable
entertainment unit and focusing on improving the electronics
business.  Tokyo Electric surged 40 percent to 626 yen after Nomura
Holdings Inc. raised ratings and price targets on some of
Japan’s utilities amid expectations idled nuclear plants will be
restarted. The Yomiuri newspaper cited Abe as saying the
nation’s No. 1 utility shouldn’t take full blame for the
Fukushima meltdowns.  Confident in Abe  Investors are more confident in a Japanese leader than at
any time since at least September 2010. Abe’s policies are
perceived more optimistically than those of his counterparts in
the U.S., Europe and  China , according to a worldwide poll of
investors, analysts and traders who are Bloomberg subscribers.  Among declining shares, Singapore Airlines lost 4 percent
to S$10.93 after its operating loss widened to S$44.2 million
($35 million) in the three months ended March from S$5.2 million
a year earlier. The airline said passenger yields will probably
remain under pressure and forward bookings for the next few
months are “almost flat.”  In Sydney, WorleyParsons Ltd. tumbled 19 percent to A$19.50,
the biggest single drop on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index this week.
Australia’s largest oil and gas engineering company forecast
annual net income of A$320 million to A$340 million on softening
demand for resource infrastructure. The projection missed the
A$372 million profit estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Of the 495 companies on the Asia-Pacific gauge that have
reported quarterly earnings since the beginning of April and for
which Bloomberg has estimates, 53 percent beat projections.  To contact the reporters on this story:
