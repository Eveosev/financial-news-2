Carmelo Anthony had 28 points and the
 New York Knicks  stayed alive in the National Basketball
Association playoffs with an 85-75 home win against the  Indiana
Pacers .  J.R. Smith and Chris Copeland each added 13 points for the
Knicks, who never trailed in front of a sold-out crowd of 19,033
at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. Indiana’s 75 points were
the fewest New York allowed in the series.  “Our backs were against the wall and we weren’t ready to
go home,” Anthony said in a televised interview after the game.
“We’re taking it one day at a time. We have faith, we
believe.”  The Knicks now trail three-games-to-two in the best-of-seven second-round series. Game 6 is set for May 18 at
Indianapolis, where the Pacers are 5-0 this postseason and 4-0
against this Knicks this year. If the Knicks also win that game,
a decisive seventh game would be played in New York on May 20.  The series winner will face the defending champion Miami
Heat in the Eastern Conference finals. The Heat eliminated the
 Chicago Bulls  in five games in the second round.  Later tonight in Oakland, California, the  Golden State
Warriors  will try to even their series against the San Antonio
Spurs at 3-3. The winner of that series will play the Memphis
Grizzlies in the Western Conference finals.  Pacers Tallies  Paul George  scored 23 points to lead the Pacers, while
 David West  added 17 points and 10 rebounds. Indiana played
without point guard  George Hill , who suffered a concussion in
the first half of Game 4, when he scored 26 points.  Hill, who has averaged 16 points per game in the playoffs
and led the Pacers with 26 points in Game 4, was sidelined by a
concussion and was listed as day to day.  The Knicks held a 40-34 lead at halftime, their largest
first-half point total in three games. After being out-rebounded
by 30 in the past two games combined, the Knicks had 40 rebounds
to Indiana’s 43.  Knicks guard  Jason Kidd  continued his postseason woes,
playing less than six minutes, his fewest in a game these
playoffs. A 10-time All-Star, he is scoreless in his last nine
games, going 0-17 from the floor and 0-10 from three-point range
in 182 minutes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
