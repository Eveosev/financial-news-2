U.S. feedlots increased the
number of cattle added to their herds by 15.1 percent in
April as dry conditions encouraged ranchers to move animals
off of pastures.  About 1.750 million  head  of cattle were moved into
feedlots last month, up from 1.521 million in April 2012,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a report.
Eleven analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News  projected a 12
percent gain, on average. The feedlot herd totaled 10.735
million as of May 1, down 3.4 percent from a year earlier.
Analysts expected a 3.7 percent decline.  More than 65 percent of the High Plains was in
 “severe drought”  as of May 14, a  category  that the
Lincoln, Nebraska-based U.S. Drought Monitor says indicates
that pasture losses are likely and water shortages are
common. In the week ended May 12, 33 percent of pasture and
range conditions in 48 states were rated “poor” or “very
poor,” compared with 17 percent a year earlier, a USDA
 report  on May 13 showed.  “April of last year was a relatively low cattle-placement month,” Tim Petry, a livestock economist at
North Dakota State University in Fargo, said in an e-mail
before the report. “Due to dry pastures in parts of the
southern and northern Plains, quite a few cattle were moved
off from pastures early and into feedlots” last month, he
said.  Year Old  Feedlot operators typically buy year-old cattle that
weigh about 500 pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds,
called feeders. The animals are fattened on corn until they
weigh about 1,300 pounds, when they are sold to
meatpackers.  Feedlots sold about 1.855 million animals to
meatpackers last month, up 2.2 percent from a year earlier,
the USDA said. Analysts expected a 2.8 percent gain, on
average.  Cattle futures for August delivery fell 0.3 percent to
$1.1935 a pound at 9:51 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price was down 9.5 percent this year through
yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement fell 0.3
percent to $1.4467 a pound, and the commodity dropped 5.9
percent this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
