BP Plc (BP/)  failed to buy Russian Urals
crude at a higher price than yesterday. No bids or offers were
made for  North Sea  Forties crude.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  yesterday shut its U.K. Shearwater
oil and natural gas field for unplanned maintenance, Jonathan French, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail today.  North Sea  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days fell by 3 cents to a premium of 20 cents a barrel
to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for July settlement traded at $104.05 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window, compared
with $104.15 yesterday. The August contract was at $103.91 at
the same time today, a discount of 14 cents to July.  Shell expects the Shearwater field to “be back on stream
shortly,” French said.  Oil export capacity from the field is as much as 90,000
barrels a day, according to Shell’s website. It is linked to the
Forties Pipeline System.  Mediterranean/Urals  BP failed to buy 100,000 metric tons of Urals for June 1 to
June 5 loading at 50 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent on a
delivered basis to Rotterdam, 25 cents higher than its bid
yesterday, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window.  Total SA didn’t manage to buy Urals for May 27 to May 31 at
the same discount in northwest  Europe , the survey showed.  Urals in the Mediterranean rose by 2 cents to a discount of
6 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was at 71 cents a
barrel to the benchmark, compared with 79 cents yesterday.  OAO Surgutneftegas issued a tender to sell two cargoes of
Urals for loading from two Baltic ports, said two traders with
knowledge of the matter.  The company is offering one lot for June 3 to June 4 from
Primorsk, and one for June 4 to June 5 from Ust-Luga, the people
said, asking not to be identified because the information is
confidential. The tender closes on May 20. Each consignment is
100,000 tons.  Itochu Corp. (8001)  was unable to buy 600,000 barrels of Azeri
Light for June 3 to June 10 loading at $3.05 a barrel more than
Dated Brent, according to the survey.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend fell by 5 cents to $3.02
a barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg
