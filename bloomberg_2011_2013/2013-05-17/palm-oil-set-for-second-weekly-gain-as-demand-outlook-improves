Palm oil headed for a second weekly
advance on speculation that exports from  Malaysia , the world’s
second-largest producer, may rebound and trim stockpiles.  The contract for August delivery, the most active by
volume, gained as much as 1 percent to 2,338 ringgit ($775) a
metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives and was at 2,331
ringgit at 11:55 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur. Futures are 0.5 percent
higher this week.  Consumption usually rises during the Muslim fasting month
of Ramadan, boosting purchases from the Middle East to South
Asia including  India , the world’s biggest buyer. Reserves in
Malaysia fell 11 percent to 1.93 million tons in April, the
lowest level since June and down from a record 2.63 million tons
in December, the nation’s Palm Oil Board said May 10.  “Market players are positive on palm oil because they are
anticipating demand to improve going ahead and inventories to
draw down in May,” said Donny Khor, deputy director of futures
and commodities at RHB Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur.
Gains in soybean futures also boosted palm oil, he said.  Refined palm oil for September delivery gained 0.5 percent
to 6,072  yuan  ($989) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange,
while soybean oil increased 0.8 percent to 7,470 yuan. On the
Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans for July delivery rose 0.5
percent to $14.3475 a bushel and soybean oil for the same month
advanced 0.6 percent to 49.79 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
