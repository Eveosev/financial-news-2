Sacramento Mayor  Kevin Johnson  said
an investment group led by Vivek Ranadive has signed a contract
and wired money to purchase the National Basketball
Association’s Sacramento Kings, the  Sacramento Bee  reported.  Johnson, speaking this morning, said the deal still has to
close, but that he didn’t see any difficulties ahead, according
to the Bee.  The agreement values the  Kings  franchise at $535 million.
Ranadive, a part-owner of the  Golden State Warriors , will have
to sell his stake in the team.  Johnson has scheduled a 10 a.m. Sacramento time press
conference to discuss the agreement that will keep the franchise
in the city. NBA owners this week rejected the team’s proposed
move to Seattle and $625 million sale to Valiant Capital founder
Chris Hansen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
