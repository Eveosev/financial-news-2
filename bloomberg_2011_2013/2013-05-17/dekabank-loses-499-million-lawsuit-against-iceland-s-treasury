DekaBank Deutsche Girozentrale, the
third-biggest creditor in failed  Glitnir Bank hf , lost a 388
million-euro ($499 million) lawsuit against Iceland’s Treasury
in a ruling by the island nation’s  Supreme Court .  DekaBank, based in  Frankfurt , demanded damages from the
Treasury for imposing emergency legislation that allowed the
government to take over Glitnir in October 2008, and for failing
to properly monitor financial institutions in the north Atlantic
country.  “It’s absolutely clear that the circumstances in the
Icelandic financial markets in the fall of 2008 permitted” that
emergency legislation would be imposed by the authorities,
according to the  ruling  posted on the court’s website yesterday.
“It has not been proven that the action taken was more
inflictive than necessary.”  Glitnir,  Kaupthing Bank hf  and  Landsbanki Islands hf  all
failed within days of each other in October 2008. That left
creditors struggling to recover $85 billion in debt. DekaBank is
owed 67.6 billion kronur, according to a  written answer  to
parliament by former Economy Minister Gylfi Magnusson.  To contact the reporter on this story:
