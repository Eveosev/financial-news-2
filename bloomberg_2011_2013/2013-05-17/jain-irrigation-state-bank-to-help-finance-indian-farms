Indiaâ€™s biggest lender,  State Bank of
India , plans to work with  Jain Irrigation Systems Ltd. (JI) , the
largest irrigation-equipment maker in Asia, to help farmers
reduce water usage and increase productivity.  Jain, based in Jalgaon, India, will help the bank identify
Indian farmers in need of financing for micro-irrigation
systems,  State Bank  said in an e-mailed statement.  Drip and sprinkler irrigation systems increase the
profitability of farms by allowing more land to be irrigated
with less water and help boost yields, according to the
statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
