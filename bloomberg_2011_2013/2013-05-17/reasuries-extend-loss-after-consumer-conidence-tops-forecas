Treasuries  declined  after a measure
of  consumer confidence  in May reached an almost six-year high
and an index of leading economic indicators topped forecasts, as
Federal Reserve officials debate the pace of asset purchases.  The yield on the 10-year note climbed from almost the
lowest level in a week as Fed Bank of San Francisco President
 John Williams  said yesterday the central bank may begin to slow
bond purchases as early as this summer. The difference between
yields on 10-year notes and similar-maturity inflation-indexed
debt shrank to the lowest level since August, indicating reduced
concern about rising prices. Hedge-fund managers and other large
speculators held a net-short position in 10-year note futures
for the first time in almost two months.  “The Fed is going to continue its public debate about when
to taper, without actually tapering,” said Steven Ricchiuto,
chief economist in New York at Mizuho Securities USA Inc., one
of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “The 10-year
note could gradually move back to the lows. We’re right now from
1.85 to 1.98 percent.”  U.S. 10-year yields rose seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 1.95 percent as of 5 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 1.75
percent note due in May 2023 fell 20/32, or $6.25 per $1,000
face amount, to 98 6/32. The yield touched 1.86 percent
yesterday, the lowest level since May 10. It increased five
basis points on the week.  Ten-year yields have risen for three consecutive weeks,
from 1.66 percent on April 26, in the longest stretch of
increases since December.  Futures Bets  Volatility rose to the highest level since March. Bank of
America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index measuring price swings in
Treasuries increased to 61.33 basis points, the highest level
since March 22. The index fell to an all-time low of 48.87 basis
points on May 9. The measure averaged 62.5 basis points during
the past 12 months.  Investors reversed from a net-long position to a net-short
position in 10-year note futures in the week ending May 14, the
first time in a net-short position since March 22, according to
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  Speculative short positions, or bets prices will fall,
outnumbered long positions by 11,153 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade.  Last week, traders were net-long 37,956
contracts.  Meanwhile, in 30-year  bond futures , speculative long
positions, or bets prices will rise, outnumbered short positions
by 14,638 contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade. Net-long
positions rose by 7,149 contracts, or 95 percent, from a week
earlier.  Issuance of Treasury notes, bonds and TIPS could plunge if
the  Congressional Budget Office ’s estimate of smaller federal
deficits proves accurate, wrote  Michael Schumacher , head of
global rates strategy at UBS AG, in a report dated yesterday.
Net issuance totaled $667 billion between Oct. 1 and April 30,
exceeding the CBO’s predicted budget deficit with five months
remaining in the fiscal year, he wrote.  Budget Update  A report May 14 showed the  U.S. budget deficit  will shrink
this fiscal year to $642 billion, the smallest shortfall in five
years, according to the nonpartisan CBO. The agency reduced its
estimate of the likely deficit, citing stronger-than-expected
tax receipts. In February, it had projected a $845 billion
deficit for the 2013 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. Last
year’s deficit was $1.1 trillion.  Net issuance was $364 billion in the first four months of
calendar 2013, suggesting that Treasury needs another $176
billion of net issuance this year, the UBS strategist, noting
that amounts to a 21 percent decrease in gross issuance.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and similar-maturity TIPS shrank to 2.23 percentage points, the least since
Aug. 9, according to Bloomberg data. The  consumer price index 
decreased 0.4 percent, the biggest decline since December 2008,
after falling 0.2 percent in March, according to Labor
Department figures released yesterday.  TIPS Sale  The Treasury announced yesterday it will sell $13 billion
in 10-year TIPS on May 23. It sold an equal amount of the
securities on March 21 at a yield of negative 0.602 percent.  TIPS handed investors a loss of 1.9 percent in May through
yesterday, already making this month the worst since December
2009, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.
Treasuries overall have declined 0.7 percent.  Ten-year note yields rose to 1.98 percent on May 15, the
highest since March 15, as U.S. officials weighed whether the
economy is strong enough for them to curtail their monthly
purchases of $85 billion of government and mortgage debt. The
average for the year to date is 1.87 percent.  “They are going to taper, but we don’t know when or the
makeup,” said  David Ader , head of U.S. government bond strategy
at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “That
question and uncertainty will remain with the market for several
months further.”  Fed Policy  The Fed said after a policy meeting on May 1 it will
maintain stimulus as long as the outlook for inflation doesn’t
exceed 2.5 percent and as unemployment remains above 6.5
percent. The central bank will release minutes of the April 30
to May 1 policy makers meeting on May 22.  The central bank bought $5.5 billion of securities maturing
between February 2018 and February 2019 today, according to the
New York Fed’s website.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer sentiment rose to 83.7 in May, the highest
since July 2007, from 76.4 the prior month, a report today
showed.  The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for a
gain to 77.9.  The Conference Board’s gauge of the outlook for the next
three to six months climbed 0.6 percent in April after falling a
revised 0.2 percent in March that was steeper than previously
reported, the New York-based group said today. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 0.2
percent increase.  “There’s this ongoing debate about Fed exit strategy and
how it’s going to be handled,” said Dan Mulholland, head of
U.S. Treasury trading in the capital-markets unit of BNY Mellon
Corp. in New York. “We need to see further employment growth.
There are a lot of other things that need to happen” for
tapering to occur.  To contact the reporters on this story:
