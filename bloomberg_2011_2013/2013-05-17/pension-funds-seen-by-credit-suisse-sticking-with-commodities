Pension funds are keeping money in
commodities, which make up less than 3 percent of the average
portfolio, according to  Credit Suisse Group AG. (CSGN)   The size of the allocation “alleviates some of the pain”
from lower prices, according to the Zurich-based company. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of raw materials fell 2.4 percent
this year, led by silver and gold.  Following are comments from Kamal Naqvi, London-based head
of commodities sales for Europe, Middle East and  Africa  at
Credit Suisse. He spoke to reporters in the city yesterday.  “For people in commodities, index money is hugely
important, but for pension funds, this is only a very small part
of their portfolio. Their allocations to bonds and stocks are
far more important. This alleviates some of the pain of poor
performance.  “There is no evidence at all of pension funds getting out
of commodities.  “The feedback from pension funds and consultants is that
they still believe in the asset class, but they are changing
ways of exposure. Plain beta length is severely challenged, and
there is a clear move toward being more active. This is both
active length and also absolute return. The line between some
real-money investors and hedge funds is increasingly blurred.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
