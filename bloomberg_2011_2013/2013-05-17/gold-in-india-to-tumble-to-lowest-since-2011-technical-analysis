Gold futures in Mumbai are poised to
extend declines to the lowest level since August 2011 as a
falling trend channel signals further losses, according to a
technical analysis by Motilal Oswal Commodity Broker Pvt.  Futures may drop 8 percent to 24,000 rupees ($438) per 10
grams on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd. in the next
month, said  Kishore Narne , head of commodity and currency at the
Mumbai-based brokerage. That would be the lowest intraday price
since Aug. 4, 2011.  Bullion in  London  entered a  bear market  last month and is
off to its worst start to the year since 1982, losing 18
percent, as investors sold the metal in favor of riskier assets
on speculation that the global economy was recovering. Futures
have lost 20 percent in Mumbai since reaching an all-time high
of 32,464 rupees in November. The contract for June delivery
fell 0.3 percent to 26,047 rupees today.  “The falling channel has been on for a long time and once
the channel breaks, it repeats exactly on the bottom side,”
Narne said in an interview. “There is a range shift that has
happened and we are now into the lower range.”  A falling channel is a continuation pattern where prices
show bearish signals along a channel marked by two parallel
lines. The falling channel continues until the prices move to
break through the upper or lower end of the channel accompanied
by high volume. In  technical analysis , investors and analysts
study charts of trading patterns and prices to predict changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
