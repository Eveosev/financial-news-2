Richard Kovacevich, the former
chairman and chief executive officer at  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , said
less than two dozen institutions caused the financial crisis and
new regulations are hurting innocent commercial banks.  “Twenty financial institutions were the primary ones
involved in the financial crisis,” Kovacevich, 69, said today
in a Bloomberg Television interview with  Erik Schatzker  and Sara Eisen. “About half of those were S&Ls. The other 10 were
basically investment banks, not commercial banks,” he said,
referring to savings and loan institutions. There are more than
7,000 other U.S. banks “that are being punished that did
nothing wrong,” he said.  Wells Fargo is the biggest U.S. home lender. The company is
based in San Francisco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
