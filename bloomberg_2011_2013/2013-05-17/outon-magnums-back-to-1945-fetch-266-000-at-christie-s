Sixty-six magnums of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild spanning the period from 1945 to 2008 fetched 257,400
Swiss francs ($266,000) at a Christie’s International Plc wine
auction in Geneva this week which raised $3.96 million.  The collection of magnums from the Pauillac first-growth
estate included one from each of the 64 vintages and two each
from 1978 and 1993. Other lots included a case of Vosne-Romanee
Cros Parantoux 2000 Henri Jayer, which sold for 64,350 francs,
and 12 bottles of Le Pin 1989 Pomerol, which fetched $46,800.  An 11 percent gain in the four months to mid-March on the
Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has been followed by a 3 percent
decline since then as investors have focused on the pricing of
Bordeaux 2012 wine futures. The index on the London-based market
is still up 5 percent since the start of this year.  Last month “the fine wine market saw a pause in its
recovery as it waited for, and then reacted to, the latest en
primeur releases from Bordeaux,” The Wine Investment Fund said
in its monthly report. The London-based fund invests in Bordeaux
and has about $50 million under management.  Three magnums of Cros Parantoux 1995 Henri Jayer sold for
37,440 francs at the Christie’s auction, while a Domaine de la
Romanee-Conti assortment case from each of the years 1985 and
1996 sold for 35,100 francs and 30,420 francs respectively,
according to Christie’s online auction results.  Following is a table of major wine auctions held so far
this year, with the total sold. Links are to auction websites or
