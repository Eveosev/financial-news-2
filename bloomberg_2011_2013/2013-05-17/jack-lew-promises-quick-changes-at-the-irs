U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
said there will be quick results on any reshaping of the
 Internal Revenue Service . Acting Commissioner Daniel Werfel will
“get started full-bore next Wednesday and within 30 days he will
report to me and we will report to the president on actions
taken,” Lew told me on Bloomberg Television today.  Werfel is going to look into whether there is a “systemic”
problem at the tax agency, Lew said, and whether additional
people are going to be held accountable and any failures in
management corrected.  This follows revelations that the IRS has targeted
conservative organizations for special scrutiny for tax-exempt
status.  In our interview, Lew said that he was briefed on the
general inquiry, without any specifics, when he became secretary
in March. But like President  Barack Obama , Lew says he didn’t
know the details until a week ago. He says he has no tolerance
for this type of behavior.  Lew, who was White House chief of staff before moving to
Treasury, ducked a question on why the administration has not
yet nominated anyone to be head of the IRS.  ( Albert R. Hunt  is a Bloomberg View columnist.  Follow  him
