Cattle futures declined to a 10-month
low on speculation that consumers may balk at rising U.S. beef
prices. Hog prices were little changed.  Wholesale  beef  has surged 10 percent since the end of March
to $2.0877 a pound yesterday, the highest since at least January
2004, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Meatpackers
processed 496,000 head of cattle in the first four days of this
week, down 1.8 percent from a year earlier, government data
show.  Beef prices are “probably going to get to levels where
consumer demand will slow down,” Chad Henderson, the president
of Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield,  Wisconsin ,
said in a telephone interview.  Cattle futures for August delivery dropped 0.3 percent to
$1.1935 a pound at 10:02 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after touching $1.19275, the lowest for the most-active contract since July 12.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement declined 0.3
percent to $1.4465 a pound.  Hog futures for July settlement rose less than 0.1 percent
to 92.575 cents on the CME. The July contract is down 5 percent
this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
