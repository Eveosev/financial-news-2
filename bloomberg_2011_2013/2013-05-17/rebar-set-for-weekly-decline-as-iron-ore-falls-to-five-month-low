Steel reinforcement-bar futures
headed for a weekly loss as the price of  iron ore , the main
ingredient in steelmaking, fell to the lowest in five months.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 0.6 percent to 3,529 ($575) a metric
ton and was at 3,531 at 10:15 a.m. local time. Futures have
declined 3 percent this week, the most since the week ended
April 19.  Iron-ore prices extended losses for a fifth day yesterday
as weak Chinese demand fueled concern that they are drawing on
stockpiles rather than purchasing shipments for the raw material,
according to  Macquarie Research . Ore with 62 percent iron
content at the port of Tianjin fell 1.1 percent to $125 a dry
ton yesterday, according to The Steel Index Ltd.  “The view that iron ore prices will continue to decline is
becoming more convincing, which leads to expectations for lower
steel-products prices in the second half,” Zhang Lei, analyst
at Nanhua Futures Co., said by phone from Shenyang today.  Ore stockpiles at Chinese ports are at a record low, and
those at small  steel mills  fell to 20 days of use, Macquarie
said in an e-mailed report today. Declining steel prices are
squeezing mills’ margins, and June maintenance will probably
lead prices lower before July, while supplies will also expand
in the second half of the year, according to the report.  The average  spot price  for rebar fell 0.3 percent to 3,568
 yuan  a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
