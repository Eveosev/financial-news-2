EON  Russia , controlled by  Germany ’s
biggest utility, rose the most in 16 months in Moscow trading
over plans to pay out all of last year’s profit as dividends.  The shares gained as much as 9.4 percent, the most since
Jan. 25, 2012. EON Russia recommended paying 29 kopeks a share
for 2012, all of net income prepared to international standards,
and 40 percent to 60 percent of earnings in coming years.  “This is on par with the German controlling shareholder’s
policy and is the most generous profit distribution scheme we
have seen among Russian utilities so far,” Vladimir Sklyar, an
analyst at  Renaissance Capital , wrote today in a note.  The 2012 dividend means an 11.3 percent yield on the stock
at yesterday’s close, Sklyar said. The record day is today and
shareholders are due to vote on the plan on June 27.  The stock rose 7.1 percent to 2.75 rubles by 1:20 p.m. in
Moscow. Volume on the Micex was 2.6 times the 30-day average and
10-day volatility rose to 53.73, the highest since June 2012.  The 2012 payout will be 18.3 billion rubles ($583 million),
 EON Russia (EONR)  General Director Maxim Shirokov told reporters. The
future dividend policy is a guide, with final percentages
depending on financial results at the time, the company said.  The completion of most obligations to invest in plants and
a “strong” cash balance allows for “significant” dividends
for the first time, EON Russia said in a presentation. Its
installed capacity rose 20 percent from 2007 and its investment
program will be completed by 2015, on time and within budget.  EON Russia’s “$1 billion cash pile and ongoing operating
cash flow is more than sufficient to complete the last
investment project” at Berezovskaya power plant, Sklyar said.  “We are impressed that EON Russia has not followed, and
might have even broken, the Russian utilities sector imperative
of invest now, forget about the dividends,” Mikhail Rasstrigin
and Alexander Seleznev, VTB Capital analysts, said in a note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
