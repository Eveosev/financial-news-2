U.S. stocks  rallied for a fourth
straight week, sending benchmark indexes to record highs, as
data showing confidence improved among consumers and small
businesses fueled optimism in the world’s largest economy.  All  10 groups  in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced
during the week as financial, industrial and technology stocks
led gains. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. rose more
than 5.5 percent as hedge-fund manager David Tepper called U.S.
banks “a good sector.”  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  surged 15 percent
for the biggest increase in the Dow Jones Industrial Average
after reporting profit that topped estimates.  The S&P 500 jumped 2.1 percent to 1,667.47 over the five
days. The benchmark equity gauge has advanced every week since
April 19 and is up 17 percent this year. The Dow added 235.91
points, or 1.6 percent, to 15,354.40.  “The near-term evidence is that if we have a slowdown,
it’s not going to be as severe as in the last two years,”
Cameron Hinds, the Lincoln, Nebraska-based regional chief
investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank, which has about
$170 billion under management, said by telephone. “We had
 consumer confidence  come out and it was very strong. It’s a
reflection of what we’ve seen in the market this week and the
past few weeks.”  Americans’  confidence  in the economy climbed in May to the
highest level in almost six years, according to an index of
consumer sentiment. Separate data showed confidence among small
businesses climbed in April to a six-month high. Retail sales
and an index of U.S. leading indicators also rose, overshadowing
reports showing weakness in manufacturing.  Still Bullish  Stocks also rose after Tepper, co-founder and owner of
Appaloosa Management LP, said in an interview on CNBC that he is
still bullish and the economy is getting better. Tepper, who led
Institutional Investor’s ranking of the top earners in hedge
funds last year with $2.2 billion, said in January in a
Bloomberg Television interview that the U.S. “is on the verge
of an explosion of greatness.”  The U.S. bull market has entered its fifth year. The  S&P
500 (SPX)  has surged 146 percent from a 12-year low in 2009, driven by
better-than-estimated  corporate earnings  and three rounds of
bond purchases from the Federal Reserve.  U.S. equities retreated on May 16 after Fed Bank of San
Francisco President John Williams said the central bank may
begin slowing the pace of its $85 billion in monthly bond-buying
amid signs the economy is gradually gaining strength. Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke has said he would continue unprecedented
stimulus until the  jobless rate  falls to 6.5 percent or
inflation rises above 2.5 percent.  ‘Tapering Off’  “Everybody’s talking about how the Fed is going to message
the tapering off of quantitative easing,” Wells Fargo’s Hinds
said. “When you get the various Fed presidents talking, the
market seems to lean on that, but I think you have to pay
attention to what the official news is and what Bernanke is
saying.”  The S&P 500 has rallied 6.3 percent during the second
quarter. The period has historically meant losses for equities.
The S&P 500 slumped as much as 9.9 percent from April through
June last year. It erased 19 percent from April through October
in 2011 and 16 percent from April to July in 2010.  The benchmark gauge has dropped only four times in the past
21 days and is up 4.4 percent in May, heading for the seventh
straight month of gains.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or
 VIX (VIX) , slumped 1.1 percent to 12.45 for the week. The benchmark
gauge for options, which moves in the opposite direction to the
S&P 500 about 80 percent of the time, has fallen 31 percent this
year.  90 Percent  About 90 percent of S&P 500 stocks traded above their
average prices from the past 50 days, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That’s near the highest level in three months,
while below the two-year high of 93 percent in January.  Financial companies increased the most among 10 industries
in the S&P 500 during the week, rising 3.7 percent.  JPMorgan
Chase (JPM)  added 6.8 percent to $52.30 for the second-biggest
increase in the Dow. All 24 lenders in the KBW  Bank Index (BKX) 
rallied this week, as the gauge climbed 4.4 percent.  Tepper said his firm still owns Citigroup and other U.S.
banks. The third-largest lender in the country rose 5.5 percent
to $51.45.  Industrial stocks advanced 2.2 percent as a group, while
technology companies jumped 2 percent.  Data Delivery  Cisco surged 15 percent, the largest one-week gain since
2002, to $24.24. The biggest maker of networking equipment
reported earnings that  exceeded  analysts’ estimates as
businesses spent more to meet surging demand for data delivery
via the Web.  Education companies climbed as investors who had expected
declines in  Apollo Group Inc. (APOL)  and ITT Educational Services Inc.
were forced to buy back shares as the market rallied.  Apollo, the largest U.S. for-profit college chain, jumped
14 percent to $21.35. The stock’s short interest reached 15
percent of its shares available for trading in April, the
highest level since at least 2006, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg and Markit, a London-based research firm. The ratio
has since fallen to 13.6 percent as of May 15.  ITT Educational, whose short interest climbed to 30.5
percent from a low of 18.5 percent in January, soared 24 percent
to $25.75.  Ford, Tesla  Automaker shares jumped 5.7 percent as a group, the most
among 24 S&P 500 industries. European Union car sales rose in
April for the first time since September 2011, the Brussels-based European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association said.
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. rallied 15 percent to $14.74. Ford
Motor Co. increased 6.9 percent to $15.08.  Tesla Motors Inc. surged 19 percent to $91.50. The
electric-car maker led by billionaire Elon Musk increased the
size of its equity and debt offerings by 30 percent to repay its
U.S. loan and build up cash reserves. Tesla said it intends to
sell as many as 3.9 million shares for $92.24 apiece. Musk, 41,
is to purchase 1.08 million shares for about $100 million and
convertible notes may raise as much as $648 million. The company
on May 10 reported its first quarterly profit.  Macy’s Inc. (M)  added 3.1 percent to $48.67. The second-largest
U.S. department-store chain reported fiscal  first-quarter profit 
that beat analysts’ estimates and increased its share buyback
program by $1.5 billion.  ‘Arrested Development’  Netflix Inc. increased 9.8 percent to $239. The dominant
subscription video-streaming service said its revival of the
cult TV show “Arrested Development” could help second-quarter
results.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  slumped 4.4 percent to $433.26. Appaloosa’s
Tepper said he cut his  stake  in the iPhone maker at the start of
the year as the world’s most valuable technology company hasn’t
been “evolutionary” or “revolutionary” recently. Birinyi
Associates Inc. also trimmed its holdings in the company, while
David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital Inc. added to its Apple
position, according to separate filings.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. lost 1.3 percent to $77.87 after the
world’s largest retailer forecast second-quarter profit that was
less than analysts estimated. First-quarter sales at U.S. Wal-Mart stores open at least 12 months fell 1.4 percent, the first
drop after six straight gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
