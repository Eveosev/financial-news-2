Sierra Leone , the African nation
rebuilding its economy a decade after the end of a civil war, is
benefiting from slower inflation and a stable currency as
borrowing costs tumble and growth accelerates.  Yields on 91-day notes fell 128 basis points, or 1.28
percentage point, to a record 6.42 percent at the last central
bank auction May 9, 134 basis points higher than South African
yields and down from 19.1 percent in December after the central
bank cut  interest rates . The Finance Ministry forecasts growth
in the $3 billion economy of 15.1 percent in 2013 after last
year’s 21.3 percent, which was bolstered by the start of iron-ore exports and construction including the expansion of the
airport serving Freetown, the capital.  The improvement coincides with the government seeking to
reduce domestic borrowing by half this year after debt rose to
1.14 trillion leones ($264 million) in 2012, the ministry said
in a report published April 22. Lower bill yields should prompt
banks to cut their own rates and boost lending to companies to
support economic growth, Finance Minister Kaifala Marah said in
an e-mail April 23. The International Monetary Fund forecasts
inflation will slow to 9 percent this year from 12 percent.  “The government should not crowd out the private sector by
being the biggest single borrower in the domestic  bond market ,
driving up interest rates,” Marah said in the e-mail. “We want
the private sector to continue to participate in the economy,
and we would not achieve that if our appetite for borrowing
continues unabated.”  Lending Rate  The amount of bills sold by the Bank of Sierra Leone in the
first quarter dropped 18 percent from the previous three months
to 489 billion leones, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Debt rose as  government spending  climbed on borrowing to spend
on infrastructure projects including roads and power output.  Debt to gross domestic product will slow to 40 percent this
year from 44 percent in 2012 after climbing as high as 162
percent in 2003, according to IMF estimates and data.  The government wants to cut debt by at least 50 percent in
2013, Joseph Thullah, an economist in the ministry’s public debt
management department, said in an interview May 7. Any financing
shortfalls will be made up by seeking donor funds, he said.  The Bank of Sierra Leone lowered its key lending rate by
300 basis points to 17 percent on April 11, saying concern about
inflation pressure from prices for imported food and fuel “may
be cushioned by the relative stability in the  exchange rate .”  Civil War  The leone is the fifth-best performer among African
currencies tracked by Bloomberg this year, rising 0.3 percent
against the dollar. It traded at 4,322.58 by 4:45 p.m. in
Freetown yesterday.  Sierra Leone is spending on infrastructure and luring
investment from mining companies after the 2002 end of a civil
war that left 50,000 people dead and displaced 2 million. The
Revolutionary United Front guerrillas gained notoriety for
amputating the limbs of their victims and using children as
soldiers.  African Minerals Inc. and  London  Mining Plc, both based in
London, began iron-ore exports in late 2011,  Koidu Holdings SA 
plans to boost diamond exports and  Sierra Rutile Inc. (SRX)  is
increasing output of the material used in paint and ceramics.
 Oil companies  including Moscow-based OAO Lukoil have stakes in
offshore blocks  The deficit in Sierra Leone’s current account, the broadest
measure of trade in goods and services, may narrow to 9.7
percent of gross domestic product this year from 20.8 percent in
2012, according to the IMF.  Yields Retreat  With Sierra Leone’s improving current account and
“inflation having stabilized in low double digits, the
incentive to keep T-bill yields at substantially elevated levels
has dissipated,”  Samir Gadio , an emerging-markets strategist at
Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s London unit, said in an e-mailed
response to questions on May 15.  Yields on 182-day notes fell to 9.74 percent on May 10,
down almost 16 percentage points since the last sale of 2012.
Debt with 364-day maturities have retreated 14 percent to 11.4
percent last week. Sierra Leone sells bills on Thursdays and
offers 1-year debt at irregular intervals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
