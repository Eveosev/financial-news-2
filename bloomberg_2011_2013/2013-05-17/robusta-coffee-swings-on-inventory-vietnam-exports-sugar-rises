Robusta coffee swung between losses
and gains in London as traders weighed a gain in stockpiles
against falling exports from leading producer  Vietnam  and slow
bean arrivals in  Indonesia . Sugar advanced.  Bean stockpiles with a valid grading certificate in
warehouses monitored by NYSE Liffe rose to 127,270 metric tons
as of May 13, up from 126,100 tons two weeks earlier, according
to exchange data published yesterday. Shipments from Vietnam
dropped 30 percent in April from a month earlier, customs data
showed. A lack of sunshine in Indonesia is delaying bean drying
and slowing deliveries from farms, said Nedcoffee BV.  Robusta “will likely continue to outperform arabica for
the remainder of 2013 due to slow Indonesian arrivals and
difficulties in obtaining Vietnamese robusta,” Kona Haque, an
analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd., said in a report e-mailed today  Robusta coffee futures for July delivery gained 0.1 percent
to $2,048 a ton by 10:57 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London . Prices
rose and retreated as much as 0.2 percent earlier today. Arabica
coffee futures for July delivery advanced 0.9 percent to $1.411
a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  Coffee exports from Vietnam totaled 110,818 tons in April,
according to the country’s customs department. Shipments from
January to April were down 16 percent from a year earlier, the
data showed. Bean deliveries to Bandar Lampung, where
Indonesia’s main coffee export port is located, are about 34
percent lower since the season started last month than the same
period a year earlier, Amsterdam-based trader Nedcoffee said on
May 15.  Vietnam Beans  Lower availability of robusta beans is lifting the premium
buyers need to pay to obtain coffee from Vietnam, Nguyen Chi Cuong, chief executive officer at trading company NC Group Ltd.,
which has offices in  Ho Chi Minh City , said in an e-mail on May
15. Vietnamese beans are trading at a premium of $70 a ton to
the exchange price, up $20 a ton from a week earlier, he said.  Arabica is grown mostly in  Latin America  and favored for
specialty drinks, while robusta comes mainly from  Asia  and parts
of  Africa  and is used in instant coffee and espresso. Roasters
use both beans in some blends.  White, or refined, sugar for delivery in August was up 0.5
percent to $478.70 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Raw sugar for delivery
in July rose 0.9 percent to 16.98 cents a pound on ICE.  Cocoa for delivery in July gained 0.2 percent to 1,532
pounds ($2,335) a ton in London. Cocoa for July delivery slid
0.2 percent to $2,289 a ton in New York. Futures trading volumes
in New York were more than double the average for the past 100
days for this time of day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
