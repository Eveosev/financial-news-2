Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  Chief Executive Officer
Marissa Mayer will unveil updates to the company’s Flickr photo-sharing site at a press event in New York scheduled for May 20,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  Invitations for the briefing were sent to media outlets
yesterday. The person declined to be identified because the
information is private.  Mayer has spent much of her first year at the helm of the
biggest U.S. Web portal revamping popular services -- including
Yahoo’s home page, e-mail and weather -- with sleek designs and
mobile applications. Investing in Flickr, a site with more than
80 million monthly users, may help Mayer compete with rival
photo services offered by  Facebook Inc. (FB)  and Twitter Inc.  Anne Espiritu, a spokeswoman for Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo, declined to provide more details about next week’s
event.  Yahoo unveiled an e-mail app last month for tablet
computers that lets users manage their inbox by swiping messages
into groups organized by sender, as well as a new program for
checking weather forecasts on smartphones. An upgraded version
of Yahoo’s Flickr app for  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone was released in
December, letting users edit, crop and apply color filters to
photos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
