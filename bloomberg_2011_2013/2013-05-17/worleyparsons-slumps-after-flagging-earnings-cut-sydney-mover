WorleyParsons Ltd. (WOR) ,  Australia ’s
largest oil and gas engineering company, plunged the most in
four and a half years after cutting its earnings forecast
following lower resource spending in Australia and  Canada .  The stock  slumped  14 percent to A$19.20 at 11:09 a.m. in
Sydney, its sharpest decline since October 2008. It earlier
plunged as much as 15 percent to A$18.89, the lowest since May
2009. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.4 percent.  Underlying earnings for the year ended June 30 will be
between A$320 million ($314 million) and A$340 million as
clients in  Western Australia  defer major projects and the
company sees less than expected construction growth in the
Canadian oil sands market, the Sydney-based company said today
in a statement. The company had  forecast  in February that
underlying earnings would exceed last year’s A$345.6 million.  “Despite weaker than anticipated market conditions
impacting the second half result we continue to have confidence
in the medium and long term growth prospects of our business,”
Chief Executive Officer  Andrew Wood  said in the statement.  Resources companies including BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio
Tinto Group are reducing costs and delaying new operations as
lower commodity prices crimp revenue. Ausdrill Ltd., an
Australian mining services provider, last month cut profit
expectations by as much as 20 percent as a result of the
slowdown in the mining sector.  To contact the reporter on this story:
