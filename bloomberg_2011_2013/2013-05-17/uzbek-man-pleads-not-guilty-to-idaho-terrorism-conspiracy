An Uzbek national charged by the U.S.
with conspiring to aid an Islamic terrorist group in his native
country pleaded not guilty in federal court in Boise,  Idaho .  Fazliddin Kubranov, 30, a Boise resident, was arrested
yesterday on federal charges filed there and in Salt Lake City,
according to the Justice Department. In Idaho he’s charged with
conspiring to provide material support to the Islamic  Movement
of Uzbekistan , and in Utah, he’s charged with giving
instructions on how to build improvised explosive devices.  Kubranov, dressed in a yellow-and-white-striped Ada County
Jail jumpsuit and speaking through an interpreter, pleaded not
guilty to all charges during the 15-minute arraignment before
U.S. District Judge Mikel H. Williams.  Kubranov, represented by Idaho Federal Public Defender Dick
Rubin, asked for a bail hearing, which Williams scheduled for
May 21 before U.S. Magistrate Judge Larry Boyle. He was also
given trial date of July 2.  If convicted, Kubranov faces a possible sentence of 45
years in prison on the Idaho charges and 20 years in the  Utah 
case.  Idaho U.S. Attorney Wendy Olson said after the hearing that
Kubranov will be extradited to Utah following proceedings in
Boise.  The Idaho case is U.S. v. Kurbanov, 13-0120, U.S. District
Court, District of Idaho (Boise).  To contact the reporter on this story:
