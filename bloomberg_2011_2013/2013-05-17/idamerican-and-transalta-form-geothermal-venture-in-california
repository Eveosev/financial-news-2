MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. and
 TransAlta Corp. (TA)  formed CalEnergy LLC, a joint venture to market
electricity from 10 aging geothermal power plants they own in
 Southern California .  The companies are planning capital improvements designed to
extend the life of the plants, according to a statement today.
The geothermal facilities were originally designed to run for 30
years and eight will reach that limit in the next three to seven
years.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
