With the Allies intensifying their
bombing campaign in  Germany  and the Soviets marching on Berlin,
Hitler’s charismatic rants could no longer keep the Nazi inner
circle mesmerized. Most now fled the bunker -- “a rare case of
the sinking ship leaving the rat,” observed Professor Ian
Kershaw.  (To listen to the podcast, click here.)  On April 23, Heinrich Himmler told a Swedish diplomat the
Germans would surrender to the Allies, but not to the Red Army.
The Fuehrer was outraged by this betrayal from his “loyal
Heinrich.”  Realizing the end was near, Hitler dictated a statement
that blamed Jews for all of the world’s problems and emphasized
his own innocence: He’d always been motivated by “love and
loyalty to my people.”  Not trusting his aide any longer, Hitler tested the
Himmler-supplied cyanide on his own favorite dog, Blondi. The
animal died.  On April 30, Hitler ingested Himmler’s poison and shot
himself in the head.  I spoke with Laurence Rees, author of “Hitler’s Charisma:
Leading Millions Into the Abyss,” on the following topics:  1. Power of Hatred  2. Fear of Communism  3. Jewish Conspiracy  4. Visions, Not Policies  5. Failure at Stalingrad  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
