Malaysia’s ringgit was poised to snap
an eight-week winning streak after the country reported the
slowest economic growth since 2009, and the dollar advanced
against global currencies.  The Southeast Asian nation’s first-quarter  gross domestic
product  rose 4.1 percent from a year earlier, less than a 6.5
percent increase in the preceding period and the 5.5 percent
forecast in a Bloomberg survey, data showed May 15. The Dollar
 Index (DXY) , which measures the greenback against the currencies of
six U.S. trade partners, rose 0.9 percent this week.  “The ringgit, like most Asian currencies, is softer
because of the dollar strength,” said  Vishnu Varathan , a
Singapore-based economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. “The
fact that Malaysia’s first quarter GDP came in weaker than
expected despite election spending means that it will take a lot
more work to hold up investment in the nation.”  The ringgit dropped 0.7 percent this week to 3.0149 per
dollar as of 9:25 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur  and was little changed
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
rallied 4.4 percent in the previous eight weeks, the longest
winning streak since November 2007.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, climbed 37 basis points, or 0.37
percentage point, to 7.41 for the week. It increased four basis
points today.  The  Federal Reserve  may trim its $85 billion in monthly
bond-buying as early as this U.S. summer amid signs the economy
is gaining strength, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco
President  John Williams  said yesterday. Chinese Premier  Li
Keqiang  signaled this week that policy makers are reluctant to
use stimulus to counter a slowdown, saying Asia’s largest
economy must rely on market mechanisms to aid growth.  Government bonds advanced. The yield on the 3.48 percent
notes due March 2023 declined seven basis points to 3.07 percent
this week and was steady today, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
