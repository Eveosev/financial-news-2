Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  equities chief
Timothy O’Hara said the slide in U.S. stock trading volume is
over.  “Equity volumes have really ended what had been a multi-year trend of pretty steady declines,” he told CNBC in an
interview today. “In the U.S., where we haven’t seen the same
kind of enthusiasm around equities and equity volumes, they’re
still up 10 percent to 15 percent off of the lows of last
year.”  Average daily volume for U.S. equities has fallen more than
8 percent each of the past three years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Volume bottomed in the third quarter of
last year at 5.97 billion shares a day, about half the 10.9
billion average in the first quarter of 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
