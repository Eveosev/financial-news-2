The following is the text
of  Canada ’s wholesale trade report for March from
 Statistics Canada .  Wholesale sales advanced by 0.3% in March to $49.1 billion.
The increase was mainly due to higher sales in the motor vehicle
industry. Since May 2012, wholesale sales have been relatively
flat.  In volume terms, wholesale sales were up 0.1% in March.  Gain led by the motor vehicle industry  In March, four of the seven subsectors reported gains,
accounting for about two-thirds of wholesale sales. Excluding
the motor vehicle and parts subsector, wholesale sales were
unchanged.  Sales in the motor vehicle and parts subsector rose 2.0% to
$8.5 billion in March, its second consecutive increase. The
advance in March largely reflected higher sales in the motor
vehicle industry (+3.9%), which represents about three-quarters
of this subsector.  In the miscellaneous subsector, sales rose by 1.4%. The
increase was largely driven by a 7.8% gain in the agricultural
supplies industry, the fifth increase in six months.  Sales in the building materials and supplies subsector rose
by 0.6%. All three industries in this subsector posted higher
sales, with the majority of the increase coming from the
electrical, plumbing, heating and air-conditioning equipment and
supplies industry.  The largest decline in dollar terms was in the personal and
household goods subsector (-0.9%), mainly as a result of a 2.4%
decrease in the pharmaceuticals and pharmacy supplies industry.  Ontario and Saskatchewan post the largest increases  Wholesalers in three provinces reported increases in sales
for March.  Ontario posted a 1.4% increase, offsetting February’s
decline. Wholesalers in the province benefited mainly from
higher sales in the motor vehicle industry.  The 6.6% increase in Saskatchewan was primarily due to the
agricultural supplies industry, which represented over one-third
of the province’s sales.  In British Columbia, sales increased by 0.5%.  These gains were partially offset by the 3.5% decline in
 Alberta , the province’s first decrease in three months. The
decline was largely due to weakness in the building material and
supplies subsector within the province.  The declines in the remaining provinces largely reflect the
weakness of sales in the machinery, equipment and supplies
subsector and the personal and household goods subsector.  Slight increase in inventories  Wholesale inventories rose 0.1% in March to $61.8 billion.
Inventories were up in two of the seven subsectors.  The increases were in the inventories of the motor vehicle
and parts subsector (+1.1%) and the building materials and
supplies subsector (+0.5%).  The inventory-to-sales ratio was unchanged at 1.26 in March.  The inventory-to-sales ratio is a measure of the time in
months required to exhaust inventories if sales were to remain
at their current level.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and in
