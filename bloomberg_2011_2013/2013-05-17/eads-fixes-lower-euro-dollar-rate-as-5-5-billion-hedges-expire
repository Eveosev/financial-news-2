European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co. (EAD) ,  Europe ’s biggest aerospace and defense company, and  Safran
SA (SAF)  used currency hedges to lock in lower exchange rates for the
next four years after the euro weakened, filings show.  EADS, the parent of Airbus SAS, said on May 15 the Blagnac,
France-based company would be able to boost profitability as
legacy currency contracts expired. Safran, Europe’s second-biggest maker of  aircraft engines , also said last month it
exploited the weaker euro to purchase longer-dated hedging
contracts.  “During the first quarter, we implemented $4.9 billion of
new hedge contracts at an average of $1.33, which is
significantly more favorable than the average rates maturing
this quarter,” EADS Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm said
on a call with analysts. “During the first quarter of 2013,
$5.5 billion of forward contracts matured at an average of
$1.38.”  Currency hedging is important to EADS and Safran because
the bulk of their sales are denominated in dollars and come from
outside Europe, while their costs are incurred in euros.  Safran implemented a “significant increase” in its 2016
hedging at $1.25, CFO Ross McInnes said on an April 23 earnings
call. “Our target here remains to be below $1.26, which should
continue to deliver some tailwind over the next few years in our
foreign exchange,” McInnes said.  Contract Losses  The euro traded at $1.2823 as of 9:07 a.m.  New York  time, a
6 percent decline from its Feb. 1 peak of $1.3711. For hedges
entered into when the euro was stronger, that results in mark-to-market losses on the contracts.  “At the end of March, the mark-to-market for our hedge
book portfolio was negative at around 2.5 billion euros before
tax, compared to a negative 500 million euros at the end of
2012,” EADS’s Wilhelm said. “This movement is mainly driven by
the evolution of the closing spot from $1.32 in December to
$1.27 by the end of March.”  That loss “won’t affect EADS’s liquidity because the
company doesn’t collateralize forward foreign exchange
contracts,” Rod Stone, a Paris-based spokesman for EADS, said
in an e-mailed statement.  Position Shifts  EADS and Safran kept the total size of their foreign-exchange derivative books little changed during the quarter, as
old hedges rolled off and new ones were added. EADS reduced its
hedges by $600 million to a notional $83 billion, while Safran
increased outstanding contacts by $100 million to $15.12
billion, earnings reports show.  Safran has an average rate of $1.29 in 2013 and has used
accumulator options to reduce the target exchange rate in 2015
and 2016 to $1.26. Accumulator notes allow the company to
increase firm hedging at a pre-defined rate as long as the spot
currency rate remains under a pre-defined barrier.  Should the spot rate move above the barrier, the
accumulator stops but the accrued accumulation-to-date remains.
If the spot rate moves back below the barrier, the accumulation
resumes.  “We have continued our hedging program for 2016, and that
applies as long as the euro-dollar rate remains below $1.39 for
the bulk of 2014,” Safran’s McInnes said, referring to the
barrier feature.  To contact the reporter on this story:
