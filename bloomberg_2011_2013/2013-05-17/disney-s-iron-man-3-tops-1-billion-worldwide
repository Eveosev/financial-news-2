Walt Disney ’s Co.’s super-hero movie
“Iron Man 3” passed $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales, the
company said today in an e-mailed statement.  The film from Disney’s Marvel unit had grossed $302 million
domestically through yesterday, its 14th day of release, and
$699 million overseas in 23 days of showings, the company said.
The biggest international market was  China  with $104 million
in sales.  Disney, the world’s largest entertainment company, has cut
back on the number of films it releases to focus on ones with
global appeal and the potential to be parlayed into other
businesses. This week the Burbank, California-based firm
announced that a “Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” television
show, based on its comic book characters, would debut on the
company’s ABC network.  Disney shares fell less than 1 percent to $65.96 at 12:14
p.m. in New York. The stock is up 34 percent this year through
yesterday, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has added 16
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
