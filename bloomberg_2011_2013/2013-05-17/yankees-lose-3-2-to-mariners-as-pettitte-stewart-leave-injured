Pitcher  Andy Pettitte  and catcher
Chris Stewart were the latest New York Yankees to sustain
injuries as the team lost 3-2 to the Seattle Mariners.  Pettitte (4-3) allowed two runs on four hits in 4 2/3
innings at Yankee Stadium before exiting the game with a tight
back muscle near his left shoulder, the team said.  Stewart, who became the Yankees’ starting catcher when
 Francisco Cervelli  broke his hand in late April, underwent a
scan of his left groin area after leaving the Major League
Baseball game following the seventh inning.  The team didn’t disclose the prognosis for either player.  The Yankees (25-16), who have lost two games in a row, lead
the American League East division by one game over the Boston
Red Sox (24-17), who beat the Tampa Bay Rays 4-3.  In addition to Cervelli, shortstop Derek Jeter, first
baseman Mark Teixeira, third baseman  Alex Rodriguez  and
infielders Kevin Youkilis and Eduardo Nunez are on New York’s
disabled list.  To contact the reporter on this story:
