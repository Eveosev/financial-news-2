Andy Warhol ’s 1962 silkscreen
painting “Four Marilyns” sold for $38.2 million at Phillips
tonight as two weeks of semi-annual evening art auctions were
coming to a close in  New York .  Estimated at $35 million to $50 million and consigned by an
anonymous collector, the work had three bidders vying for it.
The winner was Victoria Gelfand-Magalhaes of Gagosian gallery,
who was bidding for a client on the phone.  The 29-by-21-inch canvas depicts four almost identical
Marilyn Monroe heads: two on the top, two on the bottom. The
images are set against a cadmium-orange background and depict
the actress with lavender skin, turquoise eye-shadow and yellow
hair.  The image was based on a 1952 publicity still promoting the
film “Niagara.” Underlying the painting’s iconic quality is
the fact that it was done shortly after the star’s death.  The same work sold for $2.3 million in 1998 at  Sotheby’s (BID)  in
New York. In 1992, it sold for $955,399 at Sotheby’s  London .  “Four Marilyns” was the most expensive Warhol of this
season, which saw fewer blockbuster pieces by the late Pop
artist than previous years. Warhol ranked first among 25 top
artists by auction revenue in 2012. His works sold for a total
of $380.3 million last year, according to  Artnet .  Muse highlights include Farah Nayeri on Cannes  films ,
 Richard Vines  on dining.  To contact the reporters of this story:
