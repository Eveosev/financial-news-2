Investors poured $870 million this
week into funds that purchase bank loans, according to  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)   The increase brought deposits this year to about $25
billion, pushing the asset’s gains to more than 32 percent, the
 Charlotte , North Carolina-based bank said in a report yesterday.
 Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) ’s PowerShares Senior Loan fund, started two years
ago as the first loan ETF, reported the  creation  of 8.1 million
shares this week, valued at more than $200 million.  Loan inflows matched the weekly pace seen through this year
even as U.S. high-yield funds recorded their second-highest
outflow of 2013, Bank of America said. Investors pulled $400
million from high-yield funds, on the back of about $520 million
of redemptions from junk-bond exchange-traded funds, according
to the report.  Speculative-grade bond yields, which had dipped 54 basis
points below those on leveraged loan, have contracted to 25
basis points less than loans this week, according to  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The price of leveraged loans was at 98.85 cents on the
dollar yesterday, about the highest since July 2007, according
to the Standard & Poor’s/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index. The
average  yield  of 5.53 percent on loans has dropped 3 basis
points this week.  Leveraged loans are a form of high-risk debt that carry
ratings of less than Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and below
BBB- at S&P.  The floating-rate debt has  gained  3.2 percent this year,
S&P/LSTA index data show.  Junk bonds  have returned 5.3 percent,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch Index data show.  Barclays Plc. strategists raised their forecast on junk-bond returns to a range of 6 percent to 8 percent, up from an
earlier forecast of 4 percent to 6 percent. The increase was
prompted by signs of greater “reach for yield” and estimates
that Treasuries will be little changed at year-end, the
strategists led by Brad Rogoff and Jeffrey Meli, wrote in the
report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
