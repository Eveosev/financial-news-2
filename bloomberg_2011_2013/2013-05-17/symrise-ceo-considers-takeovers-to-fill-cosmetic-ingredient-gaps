Symrise AG (SY1)  Chief Executive Officer
Heinz-Juergen Bertram said he has found gaps in the company’s
range of cosmetic ingredients that he may fill with acquisitions
or tie-ups as he expands further beyond flavors and fragrances.  Bertram identified areas where Symrise is keen to develop
when he attended the  In-Cosmetics  trade show in Paris in April.
These are based on active ingredients for cosmetics rather than
bulk products and overlap with Symrise’s existing fragrance
operations, the CEO said in a phone interview yesterday,
declining to be more specific.  Symrise took a 15 percent stake in Probi AB at the end of
last year, helping to lay claim to the Swedish company’s
probiotics that can be used in oral-health products. Holzminden,
Germany-based Symrise is seeking to advance on the domain of
 Croda International Plc (CRDA)  and  BASF SE (BAS) ’s Cognis.  “The emulsifiers, the bulky stuff is not the turf where we
want to play,” Bertram said. “If you don’t have a good, well-maintained product pipeline, you run the risk of commoditized
product lines.”  Symrise outperformed  Givaudan SA (GIVN)  and  International Flavors
& Fragrances Inc. (IFF)  in the first quarter, with 8 percent sales
growth in local currencies, about double the pace of its rivals.  Bertram said the company is gaining market share. By
contrast, IFF is merging sites and cutting costs after
conducting a strategic review of its fragrance ingredients to
improve profitability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
