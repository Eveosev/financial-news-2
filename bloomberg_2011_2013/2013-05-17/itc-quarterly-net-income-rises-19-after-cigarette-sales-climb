ITC Ltd. (ITC) , Asia’s second-biggest
tobacco company by market value, reported fourth-quarter profit
climbed 19 percent as cigarette sales increased.  Net income  for the maker of Wills cigarettes and Bingo
snacks rose to 19.3 billion rupees ($352 million) in the three
months ended March from 16.1 billion rupees a year earlier, the
Kolkata-based company said in a statement. That compares with
the 19 billion-rupee median of 31  analysts’ estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg.  ITC, which is 31 percent owned by  British American Tobacco
Plc (BATS) , raised some cigarette prices in the quarter after excise
taxes were increased in India’s annual budget unveiled in
February. Chairman Yogesh Deveshwar has for more than a decade
been expanding into businesses such as personal care products,
food, apparel and agricultural products to cut dependence on
cigarettes.  Net sales increased to 81.8 billion rupees from 68.6
billion rupees. That compares with the 79.9 billion-rupee median
of 29 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares were little changed at 337.10 rupees as of 1:37 p.m.
in Mumbai trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
