Ethanol strengthened against gasoline
for the first time in four days as the summer driving season
neared while production costs rose.  The spread, or price difference, narrowed 1.83 cents to
23.59 cents a gallon on concern that corn, the primary U.S.
feedstock for the biofuel, will be more difficult to obtain as
farmers hold supplies while planting. Renewable Information
Numbers were mixed.  “The farmers are getting in the fields and not willing to
let go of corn,” said  Shawn McCambridge , senior grain analyst
at Jefferies Bache LLC in  Chicago . “From the ethanol
perspective, with the spread to unleaded gasoline we should see
added demand strength.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery rose 4.3 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $2.671 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 22 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for June delivery advanced 2.47 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.9069 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for July delivery climbed 11.25 cents, or 1.8 percent,
to $6.5275 a bushel in Chicago.  McCambridge said ethanol will get a boost when the U.S.
summer vacation season begins with next weekend’s Memorial Day
Holiday. Lower supplies of the fuel will aid gains, he said.  Supply Decline  Ethanol  stockpiles  last week fell 2.5 percent to 16.4
million barrels, the lowest since December 2010, a May 15 Energy
Information Administration report showed.  Production was down 5.2 percent to 857,000 barrels a day in
the week ended May 10 from a year earlier, said the EIA, the
Energy Department’s analytical arm.  Companies across the Midwest shuttered operations or
reduced output as they dealt with higher corn costs caused by
last summer’s drought, the worst since the 1930s.  U.S. farmers plan to plant 97.3 million acres of corn this
year, the most since 1936, the Agriculture Department said in a
March 28  forecast .  The corn crush spread for July was 17 cents, down from 18
cents yesterday. The spread was minus 35 cents on Dec. 31. The
amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can
be fed to livestock.  Corn-based ethanol Renewable Identification Numbers  for
2013, or RINs, climbed 0.2 percent to 83.76 cents as of 4:37
p.m.  New York  time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced
RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based
ethanol, fell 0.3 percent to 89.88 cents.  Spot Market  In cash market trading, ethanol rose 14.5 cents to $2.83
cents a gallon on the  Gulf Coast , 6.5 cents to $2.81 in New
York, 6 cents to $2.815 on the West Coast and 5.5 cents to
$2.685 a gallon in Chicago, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Gulf Coast ethanol gained 8.5 cents to trade 1.5 cents
above the West Coast, the first premium since Jan. 18, 2012,
while Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor expanded 1 cent to
12.5 cents.  U.S. refiners haven’t made any  foreign purchases  of the
biofuel since April 19, the longest such stretch since the
period ended March 2, 2012, EIA data show.  Ethanol in  Sao Paulo  cost $2.59 a gallon last week, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
