As the editor in chief of  Condé Nast Traveler  and a parent, I'm always being asked, especially by relatively new parents, "What was your first trip abroad with your kids?" They seem apprehensive, there's sometimes a touch of dread in the question. But I've always found children to be eminently portable and adaptable people, and travel with them pure joy. OK, with one exception. I took my 3-month-old daughter to Tortola—that was technically her first trip abroad. And it was not an unmitigated success. There were bats—yes, bats—in the duplex room we'd booked. Getting up for a nighttime feeding, I discovered them swooping above the crib. Scary. The weather was weirdly chilly—not for a day, but for the entire week. My daughter developed an ear infection—and she screamed the entire flight home. I've mostly repressed the memory. Our real "starter trip" was to Italy, where we went for eleven days one August when my daughter was almost six and my son almost four. We flew into Rome, then headed out for the Chianti region of Tuscany. It was perfect—and I now always recommend Italy for families with young children. Why? Because of five things you routinely find in Italy (in addition, of course, to a family-friendly culture and ubiquitous beauty): gelato, pools, pasta, traffic-less piazzas, and fountains. The fountains were a real life-saver. From the very first night. We were checked into the  Albergo de Senato , on the Piazza de la Rotonda, with a magnificent view of the Pantheon (whose giant columns are not only architectural marvels, but great to run around). And immediately to the right of those columns was the fountain of the Piazza de la Rotonda. We'd arrived that afternoon, and my husband and I were desperate for sleep. The kids' internal clocks, however, said "late afternoon"—and there was nothing we could do about it. At around midnight, we finally surrendered—got dressed again, and went out. The piazza was abuzz, the cafes were still open, and the illuminated fountain was the most delightful and wildly entertaining thing S. and A. had ever seen. An hour or so later, finally tired out—all that splashing, running, laughing, trying to fall in—they were ready for sleep. Bliss. The nighttime fountain became our Roman ritual—not only a fool-proof cure for jet lag, but more importantly, a great memory. And isn't that really the point of family travel—of all travel?
