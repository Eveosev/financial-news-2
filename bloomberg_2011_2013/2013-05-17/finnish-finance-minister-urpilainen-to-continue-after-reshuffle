Finland ’s Finance Minister Jutta Urpilainen said she will continue in her job after switching
three ministerial posts in her Social Democrat party’s first
reshuffle since joining the government in 2011.  Urpilainen, who leads the Social Democrats inside Finland’s
six-party ruling coalition, said Housing and Communications
Minister Krista Kiuru will become education minister to replace
Jukka Gustafsson. Susanna Huovinen will take over from Maria Guzenina-Richardson as minister for social services and health.
Pia Viitanen will become housing and communications minister,
Urpilainen said.  “I intend to continue these rhythm changes, this is an
important first step,” she told reporters in Helsinki today.
“Next we’ll draw up a new party strategy, which will outline
our future.”  Urpilainen led Finland’s demands that it receive collateral
in exchange for contributing to  Greece ’s second bailout and
Spain’s bank rescue. She said she welcomed a May 14 ruling by
Finland’s Supreme Administrative Court requiring the government
of Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen to reveal details of the
collateral deal with Greece.  Urpilainen described today’s reshuffle as something that
will bring a “lot of female energy” into the government. The
rotation in ministerial posts is no reflection of “distrust”
in her cabinet members, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
