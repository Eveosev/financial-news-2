England slumped to 209-8 at lunch of
the second day of the opening Test against New Zealand, losing
four wickets this morning at Lord’s Cricket Ground in London.  England, which started the day on 160-4, lost the wickets
of Joe Root, Matt Prior,  Stuart Broad  and  Graeme Swann , with
Prior and Broad out without scoring. Jonny Bairstow, on 29, and
 Steven Finn , on 2, were batting at the break.  The visitors are trying to win their first Test series in
England since 1999, which is also the last time they won at
Lord’s. Neil Wagner took 3-70 for New Zealand, which was also
boosted by two wickets each from Trent Boult and Tim Southee.  The two-match series continues at Leeds on May 24. The
teams drew 0-0 in their three-match series in New Zealand. They
also will play three one-day Internationals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
