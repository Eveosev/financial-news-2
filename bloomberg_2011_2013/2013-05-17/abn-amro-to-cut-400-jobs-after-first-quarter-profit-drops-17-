ABN Amro  Group NV, the third-biggest
Dutch lender, plans to cut about 400 additional jobs after
first-quarter profit tumbled 17 percent.  Net income fell to 415 million euros ($534 million) from
503 million euros a year earlier, the Amsterdam-based bank said
today. Results were boosted by a 223 million-euro release on
impaired Greek government-backed corporate loans. Operating
profit slid 34 percent to 539 million euros.  ABN Amro is seeking to cut costs, reduce reliance on its
home market and bolster earnings by expanding operations such as
private banking and energy and commodities finance. The state-owned bank said today it plans to eliminate positions in its
commercial and merchant-banking unit on top of an earlier
announced 2,350 job reductions.  “The first quarter of 2013 can be qualified as a difficult
quarter,” Chairman Gerrit Zalm said in the statement. “As
unemployment is still on the rise and no economic growth in the
Netherlands is expected for 2013, we remain cautious for the
remainder of the year.”  The lender plans to implement its latest round of job cuts
by the end of 2015, said Arien Bikker, a spokesman for ABN Amro.
The reductions are the last related to the integration of ABN
Amro and Fortis’s former Dutch banking assets after the Dutch
state took control of the businesses in 2008, Chief Financial
Officer Jan van Rutte told reporters today.  Fewer Jobs  The lender expects job numbers to drop by 1 percent to 3
percent a year structurally as it modernizes  information
technology  and as clients increasingly switch to banking by
Internet or mobile phone, it said in its 2012 annual report. ABN
Amro had 22,926 employees at the end of the first quarter.  ABN Amro’s net interest income increased by 5 percent to
1.31 billion euros from the year-ago period, while fee and
commission income rose 2 percent to 412 million euros. Other
non-interest income, including earnings from markets, derivative
transactions and hedging, swung to a loss of 8 million euros
from a positive 275 million euros a year earlier.  Impairments, excluding the release on Greek bonds, rose by
39 percent to 259 million euros, mainly on mortgage, consumer
and small business loan portfolios. Impairments on home loans
increased to 21 basis points from 10 basis points in the first
quarter of 2012, ABN said.  The Dutch economy contracted for a third straight quarter
in the three months through March, extending a recession, the
Dutch statistics bureau said earlier this week. The jobless rate
rose to 8.2 percent in April, the highest in at least a decade,
from 8.1 percent in the previous month.  Falling Prices  House prices  have plunged by about 20 percent since 2008.
They might not start to recover until 2014, according to ABN
Amro estimates. Mortgage lending by Dutch banks is equivalent to
about 90 percent of the country’s economy,  double the average  in
the euro area, the central bank said in April.  ABN Amro had 153 billion euros in  mortgage loans  in the
first quarter, with an average loan-to-value ratio of 82
percent. That was unchanged from year-end as the declining house
prices were offset by additional repayments by customers with
increased risk awareness. Loans exceeded property values in 21
percent of the outstanding mortgage values as of March 31, ABN
Amro said.  Impairments in 2013 will probably remain higher the rest of
the year, and may equal the 1.3 billion euros reported last
year, Chief Risk Officer Wietze Reehoorn said today.  The bank’s core Tier 1 ratio, a measure of financial
strength, was at 11.6 percent at the end of the first quarter,
down from 12.1 percent in the previous quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
