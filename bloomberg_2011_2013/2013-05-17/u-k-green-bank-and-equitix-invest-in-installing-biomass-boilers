Equitix Ltd., a London-based
 investment company , is investing 10 million pounds ($15 million)
in a project to replace inefficient heating systems in public
and private facilities with wood-powered boilers.  Equitix is investing 4.9 million pounds through its Energy
Saving Investments fund, whose investors include the U.K. Green
Investment Bank, it said today in an e-mailed statement. It’s
sourcing a further 5.1 million pounds from its Energy Efficiency
Fund. The plan may support as many as 60 projects that will cut
bills by as much as 30 percent and carbon-dioxide emissions.  The project will provide “a low-cost and straightforward
way for a range of organizations like schools, leisure centers
and local businesses to switch their old, inefficient and high
emission boilers for new energy-efficient biomass ones; saving
energy, cutting emissions and saving them money,” GIB Chief
Executive Officer Shaun Kingsbury said in the statement.  The investment is being made through Roundwood Energy Ltd.,
which will fund, install, maintain and fuel the heating systems
for as long as 20 years. It’s working with Woodpecker Energy
Ltd., a maker of wood pellet and wood chip biomass boilers.  Energy efficiency is a priority of the GIB, which started
in November with 3 billion pounds of funding. It’s channeling 50
million pounds into efficiency through the Equitix fund, which
will be matched by private investors. Only projects valued at
less than 30 million pounds are eligible for funding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
