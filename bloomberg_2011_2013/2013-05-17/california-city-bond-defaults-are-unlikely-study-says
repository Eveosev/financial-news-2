California , the most populous U.S.
state, isn’t likely to see a wave of cities defaulting on
payments to municipal bond holders, according to a study sought
by Treasurer Bill Lockyer’s debt and advisory commission.  The research by a San Jose State University economics
professor and private consultant found that of the 261 cities
with a population of more than 25,000, just six had greater than
a 2 percent chance of defaulting and none had a probability of
more than 4.6 percent.  Lockyer asked for the research after Meredith Whitney
incorrectly predicted in December 2010 “hundreds of billions of
dollars” of municipal defaults within a year and then three
California cities, Stockton, San Bernardino and Mammoth Lakes,
all sought bankruptcy protection last year.  “ California  local agencies have faced substantial fiscal
stress in the aftermath of the financial crisis,” the study’s
authors, Marc Joffe of Public Sector Credit Solutions and
Matthew Holian of San Jose State University, said in their
report. “However, the vast majority of California local bond
issuers continue to perform on their obligations.”  Publicity over the fiscal difficulties of some government
entities reinforced “dire predictions from high profile
analysts that a municipal market crisis is imminent,” according
to the report.  “As a result, bondholders may be dissuaded from investing
in the obligations of all municipal bond issuers -- even those
that are relatively healthy,” the report said. “This
phenomenon threatens to exacerbate municipal bond market
illiquidity.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
