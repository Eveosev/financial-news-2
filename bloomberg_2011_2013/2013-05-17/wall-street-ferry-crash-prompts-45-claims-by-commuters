The owner of SeaStreak  Wall Street , a
commuter ferry that crashed in  Manhattan ’s financial district on
Jan. 9, faces at least 45 passenger claims for damages,
according to a court filing.  The claims are pending in federal court in  Newark ,  New
Jersey , where SeaStreak sued under admiralty law on Jan. 16 and
asked a judge to limit the company’s liability to $7.6 million.
U.S. District Judge William Martini gave the passengers until
yesterday to make claims.  “There are presently more than 45 claims filed in the
case, with a total claimed amount in excess of $75 million,”
SeaStreak LLC’s lawyers wrote in a letter filed yesterday.
“SeaStreak has settled more than 35 personal injury and
property loss/damage claims that were submitted directly to
SeaStreak.”  The ferry had 326 people aboard when it left Atlantic
Highlands, New Jersey, at 8 a.m. on Jan. 9 and slammed into a
docking barge at 8:43 a.m., authorities said at the time. The
 National Transportation Safety Board  is investigating the crash.  SeaStreak has reached settlements ranging from free monthly
tickets to $265,000, according to the filing yesterday. The
company also has begun repairing the docking barge, which is
estimated to cost $350,000.  SeaStreak attorney Jeremy J.O. Harwood of Blank Rome LLP
didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.  One attorney for claimants, Edward Petkevis, said they will
argue that Martini should defeat SeaStreak’s attempt to limit
liability in the case.  ‘Devastating Effect’  “If SeaStreak is successful in their limitation complaint,
it would have a devastating effect upon the claims of the
injured passengers,” Petkevis said. “I am as confident as I
can be that limitation will be defeated and the claimants will
be able to pursue the full value of their claims.”  SeaStreak operates five vessels between central New Jersey
and Manhattan, and two between  New Bedford  and  Martha’s Vineyard 
in  Massachusetts , according to the company’s website.  SeaStreak is a sister company of Moran Towing Co., the
Interlake Steamship Co. and Mormac Marine Group Inc., according
to the website. SeaStreak and its sister companies are owned by
the Barker and Tregurtha families. James R. Barker acts as
chairman of SeaStreak and Paul R. Tregurtha is chairman and
chief executive officer of Moran Towing, according to the
website.  The case is In re SeaStreak LLC, 13-cv-00315, U.S. District
Court, District of New Jersey (Newark).  To contact the reporter on this story:
