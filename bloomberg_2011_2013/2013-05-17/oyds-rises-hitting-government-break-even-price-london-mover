Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  advanced in
 London  trading, exceeding the price at which the government says
it will break even on its holding after providing a 20 billion-pound ($30.5 billion) rescue almost five years ago.  The stock gained 1.9 percent to 62.09 pence as of 11:13
a.m. in London, surpassing the government’s 61 pence break-even
price. The stock has more than doubled in the past 12 months.  The gain puts Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  in
a position to start reducing the government’s 39 percent stake
in the lender. Lloyds Chief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio told shareholders at the U.K. lender’s annual general
meeting in Edinburgh yesterday he expects the bank will return
to profitability this year, allowing the taxpayers to start
getting their money back.  The government originally paid about 73.6 pence for its
shares when it rescued London-based Lloyds after its takeover of
mortgage lender HBOS Plc. Earlier this year, the Treasury
reduced the price below which it would recognize a loss from
selling its stakes in Lloyds and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc  to take into account fees the companies have paid the state,
officials with knowledge of the matter said in March.  Osborne, whose Conservatives trail behind the  Labour Party 
in opinion polls, could use the proceeds of the sale to fund tax
cuts or more spending before the general election, due in 2015.  Lloyds posted a near threefold gain in first-quarter profit
as impairments for bad loans declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
