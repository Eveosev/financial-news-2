Natural gas will trade below $4 per
million British thermal units for the rest of the year,
according to a KPMG LLP Global Energy Institute survey of U.S.
energy executives.  The survey showed 73 percent forecast that the price will
range from $3 to $4 in 2013. Gas for June delivery settled at
$3.932 yesterday, down 12 percent from the 2013 high of $4.444
in intraday trading on May 1.  “Greater assurance of supply appears to be stabilizing
commodity price environments and enabling large investments,”
said Regina Mayor, Houston-based oil and gas sector leader for
KPMG. “At the same time, marginal production remains shut in
which could quickly be reinstated.”  Natural gas stockpiles  rose 99 billion cubic feet last week
to 1.964 trillion, the U.S. Energy Information Administration
said yesterday. A deficit to the five-year average narrowed to
4.1 percent from 5 percent the previous week.  About 62 percent of the executives surveyed said the U.S.
can attain energy independence by 2030, up from 52 percent last
year. About a quarter said independence is possible by 2020.  The U.S. produced 84 percent of its own energy last year,
the most since 1991, according to data from the EIA.  U.S. oil
production  reached a 23-year high of 7.37 million barrels a day
in the week ended May 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
