Lesotho reached an accord with  South
Africa  to proceed with the 12 billion rand ($1.3 billion) second
phase of a hydropower project that will supply power and water,
according to Lesotho Prime Minister Thomas Thabane.  The two sides agreed May 13 to expand the Lesotho Highlands
Water Project in the kingdom, which is bordered by South Africa
on all sides, Thabane told reporters in the capital of Maseru.  South Africa will construct the Polihali dam and connecting
tunnels, while Lesotho will build other structures feeding the
current Katse dam, South African Water and Environmental Affairs
Minister Edna Molewa told  Business Day . Tenders will be issued
in late 2013 or early 2014, with completion scheduled for August
2020, Molewa said. The project supplies water to South Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
