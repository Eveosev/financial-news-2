Bonds of Transocean Ltd. rose after
shareholders rejected a dividend proposal brought by billionaire
investor  Carl Icahn , instead approving a smaller payout from the
world’s largest offshore oil rig contractor.  Transocean’s $1 billion of 6.8 percent bonds due March 2038
jumped 2.1 cents to 119.91 cents on the dollar to yield 5.34
percent, or 219.8 basis points more than Treasuries, as of 12:43
p.m. in  New York , according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The debt
traded as low as 110.59 cents in March to yield 5.98 percent.  Shareholders approved the company’s proposed $2.24-a-share
dividend, rejecting Icahn’s proposed annual payout of $4.
Transocean Chief Executive Officer Steve Newman said on a May 9
earnings call that Icahn’s proposal “is shortsighted,
irresponsible and ignores the uncertainties the company
currently faces.”  Icahn, the largest shareholder that reports its holdings in
Transocean with a 5.6 percent stake, began pushing for the
dividend and potential board changes in January.  Shareholders (RIG) 
voted in favor of one of his three board nominees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
