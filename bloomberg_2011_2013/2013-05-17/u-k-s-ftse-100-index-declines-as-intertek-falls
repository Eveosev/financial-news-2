U.K. stocks  climbed to a five-year
high, extending the benchmark  FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index’s fourth straight
weekly advance, as banks and mining companies rallied and U.S.
 consumer confidence  topped forecasts.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc rose 3.2 percent, climbing above
the level the government expects to break even on its holdings
in the lender.  Anglo American (AAL)  Plc and  Lonmin Plc (LMI)  gained after
operations in  South Africa  returned to normal following strikes.
 Intertek Group Plc (ITRK)  lost 1.9 percent after forecasting its
minerals business will hurt profitability.  The FTSE 100 added 35.26 points, or 0.5 percent, to
6,723.06 at the close in London, the highest since October 2007.
The gauge has climbed 1.5 percent this week and has  surged 14
percent  this year, boosted by central-bank stimulus.  “Equities are still very attractive, but you have to be
mindful that they have gone a long way without a meaningful
correction,” said Lars Kreckel, an equity strategist at Legal &
General Investment Management in  London , which oversees $617
billion. “If you look at sentiment and positioning, some of the
usual warning signs are not really there.”  The broader FTSE All-Share Index rose 0.6 percent today for
a 12th straight advance, its longest winning streak since 1987.
Ireland’s ISEQ Index increased 0.2 percent.  Consumer confidence in the U.S. advanced to the highest
level in almost six years in May. The Thomson Reuters/University
of Michigan preliminary  index of consumer sentiment  climbed to
83.7 in May, the highest since July 2007, from 76.4 the prior
month, a report today showed. The median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey was for a gain to 77.9.  Fed Stimulus  Gains were limited in  Europe  today after Federal Reserve
Bank of San Francisco President  John Williams  said quickening
economic growth and an improving job market may prompt the U.S.
central bank to reduce its $85 billion of monthly bond purchases
in the next few months. Williams, who doesn’t vote on policy
this year, spoke in  Portland ,  Oregon , late yesterday.  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100 companies
was 24 percent higher than the average of the past 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Lloyds rose 3.2 percent to 62.84 pence, climbing above the
61 pence price the U.K. government set to break even on its
holdings after bailing out the bank out in 2008.  The government had reduced the price below which it would
recognize a loss from selling its stakes in  Lloyds (LLOY)  and  Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  to take into account fees the lenders
paid the Treasury, officials with knowledge of the matter said
in March.  Lloyds Stake  The government originally paid about 73.6 pence for its
Lloyds shares when it provided a 20 billion-pound ($31 billion)
bailout in 2008. Shares of RBS gained 5.7 percent to 336.8
pence, the highest since February.  Anglo American rose 1.4 percent to 1,570 pence and Lonmin
gained 1.3 percent to 274.1 pence.  Anglo American’s platinum unit, the biggest producer of the
metal, said its mines are running normally after a group of
workers threatened to strike over job cuts. Lonmin also said
workers had returned to work following a two-day strike.  Ocado Group Plc (OCDO)  soared 36 percent to 274.1 pence, the
biggest jump since it sold shares in 2010, after unveiling a
partnership with William Morrison Supermarkets Plc that will
boost the online grocer’s coffers by 170 million pounds.  The 25-year agreement paves the way for Morrison to make a
belated entry to the U.K. online grocery market. The supermarket
chain will acquire the lease of Ocado’s new distribution center
in central  England  as part of a total investment of 216 million
pounds, it said today. Morrison rose 1.4 percent to 286.5 pence.  Intertek Sinks  Intertek fell 1.9 percent to 3,385 pence after the
consumer-goods testing company said declines in its minerals
business this year have trimmed its earnings margin and will
continue to be a drag on profitability this year.  Associated British Foods Plc (ABF) , the owner of Twinings tea and
Ovaltine malt drink, slid 2 percent to 1,886 pence as
strategists at Credit Suisse Group AG and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. downgraded food companies to underweight, the equivalent of
a sell recommendation. Tate & Lyle Group Plc, the maker of low-calorie sweetener Splenda, slid 1.3 percent to 850 pence.  Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. dropped 8 percent to 371.6
pence for the biggest decline in nine months. The mining
company’s three founding shareholders sent a letter to its
independent committee of directors with details of a planned bid
for the firm at a price of less than 300 pence a share,
according to people familiar with the matter.  The founders, who said April 19 they formed a group with
the Kazakh government to consider a takeover, will probably seek
an extension of the deadline for a formal proposal, the people
said, asking not to be identified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
