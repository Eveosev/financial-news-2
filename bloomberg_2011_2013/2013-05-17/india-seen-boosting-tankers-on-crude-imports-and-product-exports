India  will add demand for tankers as
the country imports more crude oil and exports more refined
products, according to E.A. Gibson Shipbrokers Ltd.  The south Asian nation has replaced the U.S. as the biggest
importer of Nigerian crude, lengthening transport distances as
India replaces supply from  Iran , the London-based shipbroker
said in an e-mailed report today. India is also building the
first stage of a 145 million-barrel crude reserve, with 40
million barrels of storage expected to be added by April 2014,
according to the report. Refining capacity already at a surplus
is expanding further, Gibson said.  “Indian oil demand is forecast to rise at relatively
strong levels, but refinery expansions are expected to even
exceed this over the next few years,” Gibson said in the
report. “This is a perfect scenario for tanker owners: more
crude in and more products out.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
