From the new film interpretation of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic to Tiffany’s Gatsby-inspired “Jazz Age Glamour” collection — the Roaring ’20s are everywhere. The home is no exception. Art deco interiors, marked by geometric patterns, metallic finishes and luxury elements, are a huge trend and it’s not just because of the new movie release. Pieces from the era are seen as classic designs earning a place in the home, whether mid-century modern or firmly traditional. What is art deco? Despite its gilded and luxe feeling, art deco is “sleek” and exquisitely detailed, says  designer David Scott . “I prefer to use plain-lined, sumptuous furniture made of luxe, unusual materials that are exotic and glamorous,” he said. Art deco emphasizes graphic and geometric designs in classic black and white, usually found in pattern rugs, wallpaper or pillows. In the 1920s, luxury was embodied in touches of metallics — gold and silver accents — and other pops of glitz in mirrored or gilded pieces. Add art deco to your home There are a few pieces you can work into any space that give a nod to the richness of the ’20s: Printed wallpaper or pillows Chevron, rays and other stark graphic prints are the hallmark of art deco design. Placed on a wallpaper, the effect is elegant. Mirrored & chrome furniture Mirrored furniture combines art deco’s emphasis on clean lines yet undeniable elegance. Just adding one piece to a room is enough to make a statement. Sunburst accents The classic sunburst shape became popular during the reign of French King Louis XVI and regained popularity during the 1920s, and again in ’60s. Mirrors, in general, are a great way to accent a space, whether it’s an iconic sunburst frame or another eye-catching shape. Bar elements “Nothing says the Jazz Age like a beautiful bar setup with a martini shaker, ice bucket and decanters filled with spirits. [It's] timeless and welcoming,” said Scott. Even if you don’t have a lot of room, a bar cart with some accoutrements can be the exact touch to finish a Roaring ’20s space. Related:
