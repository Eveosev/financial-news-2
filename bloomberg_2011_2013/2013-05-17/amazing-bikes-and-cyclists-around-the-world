At  Condé Nast Traveler,  we've been encouraging readers to use bicycles as a means of transport in cities as varied as  Doha ,  Paris  and  Berlin . Bicycling is more than appreciating the scenery while keeping fit and reducing one's carbon footprint. Understanding why and how people use bikes opens your eyes to local culture, economies, and issues of governance. Need proof? Just check out a sampling of the cyclists and bicycles I've spotted in my travels. A mountain bike, loaned to guests by  Blanket Bay Lodge , on the shore of Lake Wakatipu, New Zealand. Tip: In the winter, watch out for early morning hoarfrost, which makes roads treacherous. Before I travel to a new destination I'll read  bicycle blogs  and email bicycle shops for ideas about where and when to ride. For a long stay I might bring a  Brompton  folding bike—pictured above on the Pont des Arts in Paris—which packs into its own airline checkable suitcase. Or, I'll buy a used bike that I'll give away when it's time to go home. On a short trip I'll try to book a hotel that loans good quality bikes to guests. In rural Cambodia, where few people own cars or can afford public transportation, the bicycle is the major form of transportation for students and working adults alike. Siem Reap during the dry season, in particular, is a wonderful destination for cycling: It has flat terrain, few cars, and proximity of dozens of temples, including Angkor Wat. In the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, people make bicycle–scooter hybrids from scratch using Eucalyptus wood and recycled tires. They're strong, too: People use them to transport heavy loads of charcoal, potatoes, handmade furniture, and other commodities. New York bicycle messengers have nothing on the  bread delivery men of Cairo , who balance huge loads of fresh-baked baladi bread on wooden boards as they cycle traffic-choked roads or narrow alleys to feed the city of 18 million. Claude Marthaler, a Swiss cycling enthusiast who has traveled much of the world by bike, befriended and pedaled alongside one father of two who has been delivering bread by bike for more than 14 years. Watch Marthaler's amazing short film  here . .If you've ever traveled to Rwanda, you know how hilly the country is and how formidably fit people who regularly cycle that terrain must be. To see even more inspiring bike heroes, try to catch  Rising from the Ashes,  a new documentary narrated by Forrest Whitaker about Rwanda genocide survivors who formed the African nation's first bicycle racing team and one member's  2012 Olympic bid .
