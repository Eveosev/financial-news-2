Argentina , which has no long-term
contracts to import liquefied natural gas, is scheduled to
receive a spot cargo of the fuel from  Belgium  today, according
to ship-tracking data.  The Golar Viking, with a capacity of about 138,000 cubic
meters, will arrive at the port of Bahia Blanca southwest of
 Buenos Aires , according to ship transmissions captured by IHS
Fairplay on Bloomberg. The vessel sailed from Belgium’s LNG
terminal in Zeebrugge, where it loaded the supercooled natural
gas and departed April 27, the data show.  Argentina imports LNG through YPF SA, the country’s biggest
energy company, and state-run Energia Argentina SA, known as
Enarsa. Nobody answered two calls to YPF’s main switchboard in
Buenos Aires outside normal business hours, and Enarsa officials
didn’t immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment.  Officials from  Fluxys (FLUX) , the company that owns and operates
the Zeebrugge terminal, didn’t respond to a phone call to their
Brussels office. The facility is used by traders to store and
export cargoes as Belgium doesn’t produce its own LNG.  YPF last week closed a tender to buy seven LNG cargoes for
delivery to  Bahia Blanca . Enarsa and YPF have issued seven spot
purchase tenders seeking as many as 150 shipments since
December.  Latin America’s LNG import capacity will increase to 49.2
million metric tons a year in 2020 from a projected 30 million
this year, Anton Safronov, Total SA’s LNG origination director,
said May 9 in Singapore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
