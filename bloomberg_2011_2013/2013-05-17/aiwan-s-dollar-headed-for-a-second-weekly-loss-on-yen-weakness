Taiwan ’s dollar headed for a second
weekly loss on speculation Asian policy makers will allow their
currencies to weaken to safeguard exports after the yen fell to
the lowest since 2008.  The yen touched 102.76 versus the  U.S. dollar  on May 15,
the weakest level since October 2008, before a  Bank of Japan 
meeting next week. The BOJ unveiled a plan on April 4 to
purchase more than 7 trillion yen ($68.4 billion) of government
debt a month to achieve 2 percent inflation within two years.
Taiwan’s technology companies compete with Japan’s Sony Corp.
and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. in global markets.  “The yen will probably weaken to as low as 120 per dollar
this year,” said Tarsicio Tong, a currency trader at  Union Bank
of Taiwan (2838)  in Taipei. “Currencies like the  Taiwan dollar  and the
won will follow the trend.”  The Taiwan dollar fell 0.6 percent to NT$29.978 against its
U.S. counterpart as of 10:18 a.m. in Taipei, Taipei Forex Inc.
prices show. The currency rose 0.2 percent today, after touching
NT$30.065 earlier, the weakest level since April 9.  The local dollar was trading 0.3 percent stronger one
minute before the 4 p.m. close yesterday and finished 0.1
percent weaker. The central bank has sold the currency in the
run-up to the close on most days in the past year, according to
traders who asked not to be identified.  One-month non-deliverable forwards retreated 1 percent to
NT$30.040 against the greenback during the five-day period and
were up 0.1 percent today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected
moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, surged 84
basis points to 4.94 percent from the end of last week.  Government bonds  fell. The yield on the 0.875 percent notes
due January 2018 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, this week to 0.921 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market prices.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was steady at 0.388
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
