Corn jumped for the first time in
four days on signs that buyers will compete for tightening
inventories in the U.S., the world’s largest grower, before
farmers harvest a record crop in September. Soybeans also rose.  Stockpiles  will total 19.29 million metric tons in the year
that ends Aug. 31, down 23 percent from a year earlier, after
the worst U.S. drought since the 1930s cut output last year by
13 percent, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Global
reserves will fall 5.1 percent, the USDA said May 10. Corn for
delivery in July, before the harvest, is trading at the widest
premium to December futures in seven weeks.  “We’re coming off a short crop, so supplies are tight,”
Joseph Vaclavik, the president of Standard Grain Inc. in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “It seems like old-crop
futures will just not be taken down.”  Corn futures for July delivery rose 1.8 percent to close at
$6.5275 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
marking a weekly gain of 2.6 percent. The contract for December
delivery fell 0.9 percent to $5.195, widening the spread with
July futures to $1.3325, the most since March 28.  Production in the U.S. is forecast by the USDA to rebound
this year, with farmers expected to collect 359.2 million tons,
a jump of 31 percent. The increase will more than double
domestic stockpiles before the 2014 harvest to 50.91 million
tons.  Soybean futures for July delivery gained 1.5 percent to
$14.485 a bushel. Prices rose 3.5 percent this week, the third
straight gain. That’s the longest rally since February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
