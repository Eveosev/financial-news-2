A judge ruled that some evidence at
an inquest into the death of former Russian spy  Alexander Litvinenko  will be heard in secret, compromising his ability to
hold a “full, fair” investigation.  Judge Robert Owen said information relating to the Russian
state’s possible involvement and what U.K. authorities knew
about the risk to Litvinenko’s life won’t be discussed at public
hearings.  Lawyers representing the British government had applied for
a so-called public immunity certificate at a hearing in February
saying the release of the information would risk “serious harm
to the public.”  Litvinenko, a critic of the Kremlin who lived in London,
died in November 2006 about three weeks after being exposed to
radioactive polonium hidden in a pot of tea. British prosecutors
said in 2007 that another former Russian intelligence officer,
 Andrei Lugovoi , should be charged with murder. There is evidence
indicating the Russian government was also involved, lawyers
working on the inquest said in December.  “The inevitable consequence of my decision to uphold the
certificate in relation to the material relevant to this issue
is that it will have to be withdrawn from the scope of the
inquest,” Owen said in his written ruling today. “My duty to
carry out a full, fair and fearless investigation,” will be
compromised as a result.  U.K. inquests can’t be held in private without all parties
present, he said. One option open to the inquest is asking the
U.K. government to hold a closed inquiry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
