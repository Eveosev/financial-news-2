Toshiba Corp. (6502) , the Japanese maker of
flash-memory chips, elevators and steam turbines, has begun
production of power transformers at a new plant in  Brazil .  Toshiba Infrastructure South America Ltd., a Brazilian unit
of the Tokyo-based company, opened the 6 billion yen ($59
million) factory in Betim, Minas Gerais state, Toshiba said in a
statement today. It’s the second factory to make power
transformers for the Brazilian unit.  The Betim factory will make medium- to large-capacity
transformers while the factory in Contagem will focus on small-capacity units, according to the statement.  “Many South American countries are upgrading their social
infrastructure and planning to promote development of smart
grids,” Toshiba said in the statement.  The power transformer market in South America is forecast
to expand to $250 billion in 2015 from $210 billion in 2012,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
