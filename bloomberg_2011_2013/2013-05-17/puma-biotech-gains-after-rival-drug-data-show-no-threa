Puma Biotechnology Inc. (PBYI) , the maker of
an experimental cancer drug, had its biggest two-day gain in
seven months after data on a competitor medicine did nothing to
diminish analysts’ expectations.  Puma gained 7.4 percent to $37.36 at 4:01 p.m.  New York 
time, and has increased 17 percent in the last two days, the
most since October. The shares of the Los Angeles-based
biotechnology company have risen 99 percent this year.  Puma will start late-stage testing in the second quarter of
its experimental breast-cancer drug neratinib and also is
studying the therapy in non-small cell lung cancer, the company
said in a May 9 statement. Chief Executive Officer Alan H. Auerbach sold his previous company, Cougar Biotechnology Inc.,
for about $1 billion to Johnson & Johnson before gaining
approval of a prostate cancer medicine.  Today’s gain follows an increase of 8.5 percent yesterday
after data from the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology
meeting were released May 15 after the markets closed. Results
on  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) ’s Tykerb, a potential competitor if
Puma’s neratinib gains regulatory approval, were among the study
abstracts released for the cancer meeting, which begins May 31
in  Chicago .  “Tykerb data keeps neratinib prospects in neoadjuvant
breast cancer setting at status quo,” Joel Sendek, an analyst
at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., wrote in a research note. “We
continue to view neratinib as more active than Tykerb.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
