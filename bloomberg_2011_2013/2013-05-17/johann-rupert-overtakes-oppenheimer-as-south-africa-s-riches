Cie. Financiere Richemont SA (CFR)  Chairman
Johann Rupert, who said yesterday he will take a 12-month
sabbatical after leading the company for 25 years, has overtaken
Nicky Oppenheimeras the richest South African.  Rupert is worth $8.2 billion, according to the  Bloomberg
Billionaires Index , a daily ranking of the world’s richest
people updated yesterday at 5:30 p.m. in New York. Oppenheimer’s
wealth is estimated at $7.4 billion.  Rupert, born in Johannesburg, is the oldest son of
billionaire industrialist Anton Rupert, who founded the tobacco
company Rembrandt Group in 1948. Richemont, based in Geneva, is
the world’s second-biggest luxury-goods company with brands
including Montblanc pens and Chloe fashion.  “There are things I want to see and want to do,” Rupert,
62, said in a call with reporters about his one year leave. He
said he may travel to Antarctica and had a list of 50 books he’d
like to read. Rupert said he’ll return after the year off.  Oppenheimer, 67, is the third generation of a mining
dynasty started by his grandfather, Ernest Oppenheimer, who
founded Anglo American in 1917. Twelve years later he took
control of  De Beers , building it into the world’s biggest
diamond business.  Nicky Oppenheimer sold his family’s 40 percent stake in De
Beers to  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  for $5.1 billion last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
