Modern Times Group AB (MTGB) , the Swedish
broadcaster with operations in 36 countries, advanced the most
in 10 days in Stockholm trading after Svenska Handelsbanken AB
recommended clients to buy the shares.  MTG’s  stock  rose as much as 1.6 percent, the steepest gain
since May 7, and was 1 percent higher at 271.7 kronor at 12:34
p.m. local time. The stock has gained 20 percent this year,
valuing the company at 18.4 billion kronor ($2.8 billion). The
shares fell 31 percent last year.  “We estimate MTG’s revenue potential in  Russia , where
Viaplay launched in the second quarter of 2012, to be $600
million to $900 million, but are convinced that further markets
will be targeted ahead,” Rasmus Engberg, an analyst at
Handelsbanken in  Stockholm , said in note to clients today. He
raised his rating on the share from reduce.  MTG tumbled last year as the broadcaster’s third-quarter
profit missed estimates and it said it was increasing investment
in Nordic pay-TV content, premium channels and its online pay-TV
service. Handelsbanken said MTG is now back on its historical
path of “delivering growth and solid cash flow to reinvest in
long-term growth drivers elsewhere.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
