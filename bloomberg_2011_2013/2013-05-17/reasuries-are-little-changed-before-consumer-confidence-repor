Treasury 10-year note yields traded
at almost the lowest level in almost a week as Federal Reserve
officials debated the pace of asset purchases amid mixed
economic data.  The benchmark notes were little changed before a report
that economists project will show U.S.  consumer confidence  rose.
Reports yesterday had shown housing starts fell and initial
claims for jobless insurance climbed. Fed Bank of San Francisco
President  John Williams  said yesterday the central bank may
begin to slow bond purchases as early as this summer. The
 difference  between yields on 10-year notes and similar-maturity
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities reached the lowest level
since August, indicating reduced concern about rising prices.  “There’s this ongoing debate about Fed exit strategy and
how it’s going to be handled,” said Dan Mulholland, head of
U.S. Treasury trading in the capital-markets unit of BNY Mellon
Corp. in New York. “We need to see further employment growth.
There are a lot of other things that need to happen” for
tapering to occur.  U.S. 10-year  yields  rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.89 percent as of 8:57 a.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 1.75
percent note due in May 2023 fell 2/32, or 63 cents per $1,000
face amount, to 98 3/4. The yield touched 1.86 percent
yesterday, the lowest level since May 10.  Inflation Outlook  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and similar-maturity TIPS reached 2.23 percentage points, the least since
Aug. 9 according to Bloomberg data. The  consumer price index 
decreased 0.4 percent, the biggest decrease since December 2008,
after falling 0.2 percent in March, according to Labor
Department figures released yesterday.  The Treasury announced yesterday it will sell $13 billion
in 10-year TIPS on May 23. It sold an equal amount of the
securities on March 21 at a yield of negative 0.602 percent.  TIPS handed investors a loss of 1.9 percent in May through
yesterday, already making this month the worst since the
December 2009, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes. Treasuries overall have declined 0.7 percent.  Ten-year note yields rose to 1.98 percent on May 15, the
highest since March 15, as U.S. officials weighed whether the
economy is strong enough for them to curtail their monthly
purchases of $85 billion of government and mortgage debt. The
average for the year to date is 1.87 percent.  Data Read  “The data are a bit weak at the moment so although there
is a lot of talk about tapering, it is premature,” said  Philip Marey , a senior market economist at Rabobank Groep in Utrecht,
the Netherlands. “Treasuries will move more or less sideways in
the next few months.”  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of
consumer sentiment advanced to 77.9 in May from 76.4 in April, a
separate survey shows. The index of U.S. leading indicators, a
gauge of the outlook for the next three to six months, rose 0.2
percent in April after declining 0.1 percent a month earlier,
according to the median estimate of economists in a survey
before today’s report.  The Fed said after a policy meeting on May 1 it will keep
buying bonds as long as the outlook for inflation doesn’t exceed
2.5 percent and as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent.  Fed Governor  Sarah Bloom Raskin  said yesterday income
inequality and government cutbacks may slow economic growth for
years. Three regional central-bank presidents called for phasing
out the purchases of mortgage-backed securities as the housing
market strengthens.  The central bank plans to purchase as much as $5.75
billion of securities maturing between February 2018 and
February 2019 today, according to the New York Fed’s website.
The Fed will release minutes of the April 30 to May 1 policy
makers meeting on May 22.  Treasuries have dropped 1.1 percent this month as of
yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.
The debt has lost 0.3 percent this year after gaining 2.2
percent in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
