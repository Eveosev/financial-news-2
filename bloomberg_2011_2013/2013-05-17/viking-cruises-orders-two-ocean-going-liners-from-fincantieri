Viking Cruises Ltd. ordered two
vessels to start an ocean cruise business, a first for the
company, which has focused on river voyages, Chairman Torstein Hagen said.  The 928-passenger ships are being built by Fincantieri
Cantieri Navali Italiani Spa and will sail beginning in 2015 and
2016, respectively, on European itineraries, Hagen, who leads
 Woodland Hills , California-based Viking, said yesterday in an
interview. The company may order as many as four more, he said.  Viking, founded by Hagen in 1997, operates river cruises in
 Europe  on vessels with fewer than 200 passengers. In addition to
sailing smaller ships, the company aims to give passengers more
time at ports, an average of 12 hours per day, and less on the
water.  “Most everyone has forgotten about the destination,”
Hagen said. “We want our passengers to be able to see the
Sistine Chapel at night.”  The 37-vessel company has been in expansion mode,
introducing 16 ships in the past two years, with 12 more to come
in 2014, Hagen said. Passenger volumes have climbed 35 percent
annually over the past four years.  Viking is planning its first U.S. river cruise and may sell
shares to the public, Hagen said. Its smaller vessels are built
by Neptun Werft Gmbh in Rostock,  Germany .  To contact the reporter on this story:
