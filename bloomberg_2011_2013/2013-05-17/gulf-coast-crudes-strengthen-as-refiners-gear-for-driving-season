Oils produced on the U.S.  Gulf Coast 
gained against domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate as
refiners increased runs before the summer driving season.  Gross  inputs  to refineries in the PADD 3 region, the Gulf
Coast, increased by 327,000 barrels a day to 8.41 million last
week, the highest level since Dec. 14, according to data from
the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  “Runs are still on the upswing,” said  Andrew Lebow , a
senior vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in New York.
“You’re probably seeing the seasonal uptick in wholesale
demand, which is in turn supporting crude demand. We are heading
towards the traditional kickoff of the summer season.”  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI increased by $1 to
$10 a barrel in Cushing,  Oklahoma  at 2:05 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet oil
strengthened by 50 cents to $10.80 a barrel more than WTI.  The premium for crude from the Southern Green Canyon
increased by 90 cents to $2.50.  Thunder Horse ’s premium was
unchanged at $7.30.  Mars Blend weakened 30 cents to $5 a barrel more than WTI.
Poseidon fell 25 cents to a premium of $4.65 over WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
