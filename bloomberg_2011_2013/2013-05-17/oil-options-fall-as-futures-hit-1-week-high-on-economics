Crude oil options volatility fell as
the underlying futures advanced to a one-week high on signals
that global economic growth will accelerate, boosting
consumption of fuel.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 20.28 percent at 3:45 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 21.64 yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery increased
86 cents to settle at $96.02 a barrel on the Nymex, the highest
since May 10. Judy-delivery WTI gained 84 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $96.29.  Futures rose as the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan
 preliminary index  of consumer sentiment climbed to 83.7 in May,
more than any projection in a Bloomberg survey. A government
report showed yesterday that Japanese  gross domestic product 
grew 3.5 percent at an annualized pace, the most in a year.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
July $90 puts on volume of 4,906 lots. They fell 19 cents to 64
cents a barrel at 3:50 p.m. in  New York . July $100 calls were
the second-most active, increasing 6 cents to 79 cents a barrel
as 2,424 lots exchanged hands.  Puts, or bets that prices would fall, made up 54 percent of
volume in electronic trading today. Puts made up 55 percent of
yesterdayâ€™s volume of 119,029 contracts.  July $75 puts were the most-active options traded in the
previous session, with 5,945 contracts changing hands. They
slipped 1 cent to 4 cents a barrel. July $90 puts fell 16 cents
to 83 cents a barrel on volume of 4,949 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $105 calls with
38,001 contracts. Next were July $90 puts with 34,639 lots and
December $110 calls with 33,874.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
