Electric-car maker  Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) 
sold $600 million of convertible notes to help repay a U.S.
loan, tapping the bond market for the first time.  The carmaker run by billionaire Elon Musk issued 1.5
percent securities that can be swapped for shares at $124.52
each by June 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
stock traded at $92.51 at 10:21 a.m. in New York after almost
 tripling  in price this year.  About $452.4 million of the net proceeds from the
convertible sale and a simultaneous stock offering will be used
to repay the company’s Energy Department loan, according to a
regulatory filing from Tesla today. The Palo Alto, California-based company plans to sell as many as 3.9 million shares for
$92.24 apiece, and Musk is due to purchase 1.08 million shares
for about $100 million, the filing shows.  The convertible offering was raised from an initial $450
million, filings show.  Loans for Tesla, Ford Motor Co., Nissan Motor Co. and
Fisker Automotive Inc. were awarded in 2009 under a program
implemented by President  Barack Obama . The carmaker arranged in
March to repay its Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing
loan in five years, rather than the original 10-year period.  Tesla’s funding plan comes after the company last week
reported its first quarterly  profit .  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase
& Co. managed the offering, the filing shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
