Record palm-oil exports from
 Indonesia , the world’s largest producer, in the first five
months this year indicated “sharply higher world import
requirements,” according to Oil World.  Shipments increased 28 percent to 9.1 million metric tons
as low prices spurred demand from consumers in the food and
energy industries, the Hamburg-based research company said in a
report. Palm oil prices have fallen 21 percent in the past year
as global supplies beat demand.  “Indonesian palm oil exports were surprisingly large,”
Oil World said. “The substantial increase in palm oil exports
is an indication that Indonesian stocks of palm oil declined
significantly from the unusually high level registered at the
end of 2012.”  In  Malaysia , the world’s second-largest producer, crude
palm oil output was a record 10.07 million tons this year
through July, up 5.9 percent from the same period last year as
exports climbed 10 percent in July alone from a year earlier,
Oil World said. Buyers included  China , Singapore, Vietnam,
Russia and Egypt, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
