Copper and nickel declined for a
second day on concern that the  Federal Reserve  may begin to
reduce its bond purchases this year, eroding demand prospects
for raw materials.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange fell 0.3 percent to $7,285.50 a metric ton by 1:55 p.m.
in Tokyo, reversing an earlier gain of as much as 0.4 percent.
The price slumped 1.3 percent yesterday after touching a 10-week
high on Aug. 16. Nickel sank 0.8 percent to $14,686 a ton.  The Federal Reserve, which will publish minutes of its July
meeting tomorrow, will probably start reducing bond purchases in
September, according to 65 percent of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The bond purchases were intended to boost economic
growth in the U.S., the world’s second-biggest copper consumer.  “Sentiment for copper remained subdued on concern over the
Fed’s stimulus view,” said  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at
commodities broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo. “Investors remain on
the sidelines before manufacturing data in China this week.”  HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics will release on Aug.
22 a preliminary reading for China on a manufacturing purchasing
managers’ index for August, which is expected to come in at 48.1
from 47.7 in July, according to a Bloomberg survey. A reading
below 50 indicates contraction.  Futures for delivery in December on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange declined 0.7 percent at 52,380  yuan  ($8,557) a ton.
Metal for delivery in December fell 0.4 percent at $3.323 a
pound on the Comex in  New York .  On the LME, aluminum, lead, zinc and tin also dropped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
