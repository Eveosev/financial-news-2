New York Giants wide receiver  Victor Cruz  probably won’t play again during the preseason after
injuring his foot two days ago, the New York Daily News
reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the team’s
plans.  Cruz, 26, bruised his left heel in the team’s second
preseason game against the Indianapolis Colts, coach  Tom Coughlin  said yesterday on a conference call. Cruz probably
won’t practice today and will be re-evaluated later in the week,
according to Coughlin.  Giants spokesman Pat Hanlon declined in an e-mail to
comment on the Daily News  report , which said the team will be
cautious with the 2012 Pro Bowl selection, who signed a six-year, $46 million contract this offseason. Cruz wore a
protective boot last night, according to the newspaper.  Undrafted out of the  University of Massachusetts  and signed
by the Giants in 2010, Cruz had a team-leading 1,092 yards
receiving and 10 touchdown catches last season. He didn’t attend
the team’s offseason conditioning program or June minicamp as he
negotiated his new contract.  New York’s first-team offense has scored one touchdown this
preseason, a 57-yard pass from Eli Manning to Cruz.  Center David Baas is also considered week-to-week after
injuring a ligament in his knee against the Colts, Coughlin
said.  The Giants face the New York Jets on Aug. 24, and finish
the four-game National Football League exhibition schedule
against the  New England Patriots  on Aug. 29. They open the
regular season on Sept. 8 against the division-rival  Dallas
Cowboys .  To contact the reporters on this story:
