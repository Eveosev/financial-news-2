European stocks  fell for a second
day, following Asian shares lower, amid speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will curb its bond-buying program as soon as next month.  BHP Billiton  Ltd. lost 1.7 percent after posting full-year
net income that missed analyst forecasts.  Glencore Xstrata (GLEN)  Plc
slid 1.6 percent after writing down $7.7 billion of assets, even
as it posted first-half adjusted net income that beat analyst
predictions.  Lindt (LISN)  & Spruengli AG rose to its highest price
since November 2007 as the world’s largest maker of premium
chocolate reported earnings before interest and taxes that
exceeded estimates.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.8 percent to 302.25 at
the close of trading, its lowest level since July 31. The equity
benchmark has  fallen 2.7 percent  from its peak this year on May
22 as Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S. central bank
could pare stimulus measures if the economy improves in line
with its forecasts.  “Markets are definitely more jittery and it seems to be a
regurgitation of the Fed tapering concerns,” James Butterfill,
who helps manage about $44 billion as head of global equity
strategy at Coutts & Co. in  London , said in a telephone
interview. “We’ve got the Fed minutes tomorrow. The balance of
probabilities is swinging towards a tapering announcement in
September rather than December but the timing still remains
inconclusive in our view.”  Investors will study the minutes of the Federal Open Market
Committee’s July 30-31 meeting for signs of when it will begin
to reduce the $85 billion pace of monthly bond purchases. The
minutes may also describe the risks from inflation staying below
the central bank’s 2 percent goal.  Reduce Stimulus  Officials will probably begin to reduce the buying next
month, according to 65 percent of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg on Aug. 9-13. The FOMC holds its next two-day meeting
on Sept. 17-18.  Stocks in  Asia   slid , with the regional benchmark gauge
falling to its lowest level in six weeks after metals prices
declined for the first time in five days. All 10 industry groups
on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell.  “Asian markets are concerned that the Fed stimulus package
will be phased out, which led to a strong decline in the markets
today,” Roger Peeters, chief executive officer at Close
Brothers Seydler Research in  Frankfurt , wrote in an e-mail.  The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600 companies
was 9.4 percent higher than the 30-day average, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  National benchmark indexes dropped in 17 of the 18 western
European markets.  France ’s CAC 40 Index slipped 1.4 percent,
 Germany ’s DAX Index lost 0.8 percent and the U.K.’s FTSE 100
Index fell 0.2 percent.  BHP Misses  BHP Billiton (BHP)  retreated 1.7 percent to 1,923.5 pence. The
world’s biggest mining company said full-year profit slumped 30
percent after prices declined.  Net income  dropped to $10.9
billion in the year to June 30 from $15.4 billion a year ago.
Profit, excluding one-time items, of $11.8 billion missed the
$12.7 billion median forecast of analyst surveyed by Bloomberg.  Glencore Xstrata dropped 1.6 percent to 297.15 pence. The
world’s biggest exporter of power station coal said first-half
profit slid 39 percent and it wrote down the value of assets
acquired in the Xstrata Plc takeover by $7.7 billion.  Adjusted net income fell to $2.04 billion from $3.36
billion a year earlier, Glencore said. That still beat the $1.87
billion average estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Building-material companies fell as CRH Plc cut its
earnings forecast.  CRH declined 2.2 percent to 1,394 pence in London. The
construction-materials company said it expects second-half
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
to be in line with last year. In May, it forecast earnings to
beat last year’s.  Holcim, HeidelbergCement  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the world’s largest maker of cement, dropped
2.1 percent to 66.30 Swiss francs. HeidelbergCement AG, the
third biggest, slid 2.5 percent to 54.42 euros.  Deutsche Wohnen AG (DWNI)  slipped 4.7 percent to 13.49 euros after
it offered to buy GSW Immobilien AG in an all-share transaction
that would create the second-largest owner of German homes. GSW
jumped 6.3 percent to 33.45 euros, its highest price in almost
three months.  Lindt gained 2.2 percent to 43,160 Swiss francs. The
chocolate maker raised its profitability forecast after
reporting first-half earnings that beat estimates as improving
economic growth boosted consumption.  The operating-margin increase this year will be near the
upper end of a targeted 0.2 percentage-point to 0.4 percentage-point range. First-half net income rose 40 percent to 48.8
million Swiss francs ($53 million), beating the 44.3 million-franc average of five analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Straumann Earnings  Straumann Holding AG (STMN)  climbed 8.5 percent to 166 francs, its
highest price since February 2012, after it said it doesn’t
expect full-year revenue to exceed last year’s level. The
world’s biggest manufacturer of dental implants reported Ebit
for the first half of this year of 56.8 million francs compared
with 54.6 million francs a year earlier.  Ladbrokes Plc (LAD)  advanced 3.1 percent to 197.5 pence after
Deutsche Bank AG upgraded the U.K. gambling operator to buy from
hold. The company has addressed operational issues including
inadequate sports trading capabilities and weak client risk
management, according to Deutsche Bank, which forecast medium-term online-market gains, strong cash generation and a recovery
in group earnings before interest and taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
