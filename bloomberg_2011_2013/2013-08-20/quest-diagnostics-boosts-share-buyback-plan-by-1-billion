Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX) , the biggest
U.S. operator of medical labs, said its board increased a
company share repurchase plan by $1 billion.  The buyback “is consistent with our long-term disciplined
capital deployment strategy, which includes returning the
majority of our free  cash flow  to shareholders,”  Steve Rusckowski , chief executive officer of the Madison, New Jersey-based company, said today in a statement.  Quest also will use $300 million in net proceeds from the
sale of royalty rights to an experimental cancer drug as part of
the share buyback program. The company said July 18 it had sold
royalty rights for the drug, ibrutinib, for $485 million in cash
to Royalty Pharma.  Quest shares gained 1.7 percent to $59.76 in extended
trading at 4:41 p.m. New York time. The company has declined 3.4
percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
