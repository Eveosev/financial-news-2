The number of Americans traveling
for the Labor Day holiday weekend will climb to the most in five
years as  consumer confidence  boosts spending, AAA forecast.  People taking trips of 50 miles (80 kilometers) or more
from home will increase to 34.1 million from 32.7 million last
year,  AAA , the biggest U.S. motoring organization, said in its
annual outlook. That’s the highest level since a record 45.1
million travelers five years ago. The long weekend runs from
Aug. 29 to Sept. 2.  “Consumers are the most upbeat they have been since early
2008,” according to AAA, which cited economic optimism fueled
in part by a strengthening housing market.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan  index of
consumer sentiment  in the U.S. hit a six-year high in July. New-home construction climbed 5.9 percent to an 896,000 annualized
rate that same month, and the S&P/Case-Shiller index of property
values in 20 cities rose 12.2 percent in May from a year
earlier, the biggest 12-month gain since March 2006.  The expected gain in Labor Day travel is driven by “the
increasingly positive economic outlook and optimism in the
housing market,” Robert L. Darbelnet, chief executive officer
of Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said in a statement. “As  home
prices  improve in many parts of the country, more families are
feeling comfortable about traveling this Labor Day holiday.”  Travel by automobile will rise 4.3 percent to 29.2 million
travelers from 28 million a year ago. The number of air
travelers during the holiday will increase 2.8 percent to 2.61
million from 2.54 million a year ago, making up 8 percent of
travel, according to AAA.  Retail Gasoline  As of mid-August, retail gasoline prices were about 2.7
percent lower than the same time a year ago, AAA said. The price
at the pump last Labor Day averaged $3.83 a gallon, a record
high for the holiday.  Retail gasoline , averaged nationwide, fell
0.1 cent yesterday to $3.537 a gallon, AAA said today on its
website, the lowest level since July 10.  “AAA forecasts gas prices to remain less expensive than
last year based on current trends through the middle of August,
but there remains the potential for late-summer hurricanes and
refinery problems that could send prices higher,” the group
said.  The average distance traveled during the holiday will be
594 miles, down from 626 miles a year earlier, while spending
will rise to $804 from $749 per trip, AAA said, based on the
median estimate.  The projections by AAA are based on research and forecasts
from IHS Global Insight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
