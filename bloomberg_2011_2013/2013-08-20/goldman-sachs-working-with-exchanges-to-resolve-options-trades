Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is working
with exchanges to resolve faulty options trades that roiled
markets this morning and any losses “would not be material to
the financial condition of the firm,” according to an e-mail
from spokesman  David Wells .  At least three operators of U.S. options exchanges are
reviewing trades that took place at the beginning of the day and
NYSE Amex Options said most of the transactions may be canceled.  A “large number” of trades in tickers beginning with
letters H through L in the first 17 minutes are being examined
by NYSE Amex Options, it said in a statement. CBOE Holdings, the
largest venue, said it is examining trades between 9:30 and 9:41
a.m. Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. is reviewing options transactions
from 9:30 to 9:47 a.m., according to its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
