German stocks  fell for a second day
amid speculation the Federal Reserve will ease its bond-buying
program as soon as next month.  Salzgitter AG (SZG)  slid 3.8 percent as Morgan Stanley and
Citigroup Inc. cut their recommendations on the steelmaker.
 Continental AG (CON)  retreated 1.3 percent after MainFirst Bank AG
downgraded the tiremaker’s shares.  GSW Immobilien AG (GIB)  surged by a
record after  Deutsche Wohnen AG (DWNI)  offered to buy Berlin’s biggest
publicly traded residential landlord in an all-share
transaction. Deutsche Wohnen lost 4.7 percent.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  sank 0.8 percent to 8,300.03 at the close of
trading in Frankfurt. The benchmark gauge has  fallen 2.7 percent 
from its all-time high on May 22 as Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said the U.S. central bank could pare stimulus measures if the
world’s largest economy improves in line with forecasts. The
broader HDAX Index also declined 0.8 percent today.  “Momentum is fading on stocks today as tapering in the
U.S., growth concerns in Asia and a stagnant economy in Europe
are on the minds of equity investors,” Daniel Weston, a
portfolio manager at Aimed Capital GmbH in Munich, wrote in an
e-mail.  Minutes of the Fed’s July 30-31 meeting to be released
tomorrow may indicate when central bankers plan to trim
purchases of $85 billion of debt a month. Officials will
probably begin to reduce the buying next month, according to 65
percent of economists surveyed by Bloomberg on Aug. 9-13.  Salzgitter Downgrade  Salzgitter, Germany’s second-biggest steelmaker, lost 3.8
percent to 28.34 euros. Citigroup downgraded the shares to
neutral from buy, citing overcapacity that may limit price
increases. Morgan Stanley cut the stock to underweight, similar
to a sell rating, from equal weight, saying the shares have
“run materially ahead of fundamentals.”  Continental, Europe’s second-largest auto-parts maker, lost
1.3 percent to 117.65 euros as MainFirst downgraded the shares
to underperform from outperform.  Preferred shares of Volkswagen AG led automakers lower,
falling 1.8 percent to 180.70 euros. Porsche SE slid 2.3 percent
to 66.16 euros.  Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s third-biggest luxury-vehicle maker, declined 1 percent to 54.59 euros. Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG slid 1.3 percent to 74.05 euros.  HeidelbergCement AG (HEI) , the third-largest maker of cement,
lost 2.5 percent to 54.42 euros. Industry peer CRH Plc pared its
second-half earnings guidance, citing weak demand from the euro
region. HeidelbergCement slid 4 percent yesterday as UBS AG
downgraded Swiss rival Holcim Ltd.  GSW Gains  GSW Immobilien surged 6.3 percent to 33.45 euros, the
biggest gain since its initial public offering in April 2011.
Deutsche Wohnen will offer 51 new shares for every 20 GSW
shares, valuing GSW’s equity at about 1.75 billion euros ($2.3
billion), according to a statement today.  Deutsche Wohnen said GSW will own about 43 percent of the
combined company if all shareholders accept the offer. Shares in
Deutsche Wohnen, which has 90,000 apartments across  Germany ,
tumbled 4.7 percent to 13.49 euros, its biggest decline since
May 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
