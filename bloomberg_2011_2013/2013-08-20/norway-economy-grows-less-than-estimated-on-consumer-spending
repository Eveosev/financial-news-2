Norway ’s krone slumped after a
report showed the economy expanded less than estimated in the
second quarter, boosting speculation the central bank will lower
 interest rates .  The currency dropped as much as 1.4 percent to 8.0023 per
euro, and traded at 7.9857 as of 10:33 a.m. in Oslo. It fell as
much as 1.3 percent to 5.9825 per dollar. The krone was the
biggest loser after the  New Zealand dollar  against the two
currencies among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Gross domestic product, excluding oil, gas and shipping,
increased 0.2 percent, after expanding a revised 0.6 percent the
prior quarter, Oslo-based  Statistics Norway  said today. Growth
was seen at 0.7 percent, according to median estimate in a
survey of 13 economists by Bloomberg. Total output expanded 0.8
percent, missing an estimate for 1 percent growth.  “After this number, a rate cut is not out of the question
anymore, as some have argued,” Kjersti Haugland, an analyst at
DNB ASA, said by phone. “We do, however, see that since the
inflation figure was released the probability of a rate cut in
September is significantly lower.”  Norway’s central bank kept its benchmark interest rate at
1.5 percent in June and signaled an increased chance for a rate
cut next month to support growth and prevent inflation from
slowing further. Data had since revealed a strengthening
economy, including higher-than-estimated industrial production,
retail sales and inflation, damping expectations of a reduction.  Consumer spending  grew 0.2 percent in the quarter, while
investment gained 5.1 percent. Exports rose 2.2 percent.
Petroleum and shipping increased 3.5 percent and final domestic
use of goods and services rose 0.3 percent in the period.  Policy makers have kept borrowing costs unchanged since
March 2011 to limit gains in the krone, which emerged as a haven
from the euro crisis. A report last week showed the euro area
surfaced from its record-long recession, promising to support
exports from Norway.  Norges Bank predicts Norway’s mainland economic will grow
2.5 percent this year and 2.75 percent in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
