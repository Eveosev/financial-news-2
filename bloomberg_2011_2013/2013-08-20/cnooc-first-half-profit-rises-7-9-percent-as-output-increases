Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest offshore
oil and gas explorer, posted a better-than-estimated 7.9 percent
increase in first-half profit as rising output helped counter
higher costs, including at unit Nexen Inc. The shares advanced
the most in 19 months.  Net income rose to 34.38 billion  yuan  ($5.6 billion), or
0.77 yuan a share, from 31.87 billion yuan, or 0.71 yuan, a year
earlier, Cnooc said in a  statement  yesterday. That compared with
the 30.25 billion yuan median estimate of eight analysts,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nexen, a Canadian  oil company  Cnooc bought earlier this
year for $15.1 billion in China’s biggest overseas acquisition,
contributed about 0.5 percent to profit, even as its output
accounted for 13 percent of the Chinese company’s total. Cnooc’s
net production in the period rose 23 percent to 198.10 million
barrels of oil equivalent, according to the statement.  “Operation cost at Nexen was a bit high but the
acquisition provided exactly what the company had expected,” Li Fanrong, Cnooc’s chief executive officer, said at a press
conference in  Hong Kong  yesterday. “In the longer term, the
rich unconventional oil and gas reserves at Nexen will provide
Cnooc the kind of resources to achieve consistent and solid
growth.”  Cnooc’s production cost jumped 22 percent to $42.36 per
barrel, including Nexen, it said in the statement.  Cnooc  climbed  4.9 percent, the most since Jan. 17, 2012, to
HK$15.54 at the close in Hong Kong. The stock was the best
performer on the benchmark  Hang Seng Index  today.  New Projects  Nexen contributed 24.8 million barrels of oil equivalent to
total output. Cnooc may not see a significant increase in oil
and gas production in the second half compared with the first,
as most of 10 new offshore projects in  China  won’t start
operating before the end of the year, CEO Li said.  The increase in output helped compensate for the decline in
the price of crude. Brent, the benchmark crude for more than
half of the world’s oil, dropped to an average of $107.90 per
barrel in the first six months from $113.60 a barrel a year ago.  Nexen contributed 197 million yuan to Cnooc’s profit in the
first half, and its operating cost raised Cnooc’s per barrel
production cost by 22 percent to $42.36. Excluding Nexen
numbers, Cnooc’s per barrel cost increased 9.3 percent to
$37.81. Cnooc didn’t provide a breakdown of Nexen’s numbers.  “We remain willing to give them the benefit of doubt, and
believe Cnooc management can bring costs down,”  Neil Beveridge ,
a Hong Kong-based oil and gas analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &
Co., wrote in an e-mailed research note yesterday.  Cnooc’s revenue was 139 billion yuan in the first six
months, compared with 118 billion yuan a year earlier, according
to the statement. Cnooc’s realized crude price dropped by 10
percent to $104.20 a barrel, compared with a 5 percent decline
for Brent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
