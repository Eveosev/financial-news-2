Indian stocks tumbled for the third
day, with the benchmark index poised for an 11-month low, after
the nation’s currency sank to a record low.  State Bank of India  plunged to its lowest level in more
than four years, putting a gauge of 13 lenders on course to
close at 17-month low.  ITC Ltd. (ITC) ,  India ’s biggest cigarette maker
which has the highest weighting on the benchmark  stock index ,
dropped 2.5 percent. The rupee fell to an unprecedented 64.12
per dollar.  The S&P BSE Sensex retreated 1.1 percent to 18,111.65 at
10:09 a.m. in Mumbai. The 30-stock measure has slid 11 percent
from this year’s high on July 23 amid concerns policy makers’
efforts to contain a record slump in the currency will hurt
economic growth. Citigroup Inc. cut its year-end forecast for
the Sensex to 18,900 from 20,800 in a report dated today.  Economic slowdown and a weak currency is hurting company
earnings. Combined profits for the 30 companies in the Sensex
increased 1.4 percent in the three months ended June compared
with an estimate of 5.8 percent before the reporting season
began, Bank of America analysts Jyotivardhan Jaipuria and Anand
Kumar wrote in a report dated yesterday.  About 47 percent of Sensex companies that posted earnings
for the June quarter missed analyst estimates. That compares
with 27 percent for the March quarter, and 43 percent in the
three months ended December, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “It appears we’re not going to see any growth in earnings
for this fiscal year” ending March 2014,  Manish Sonthalia , who
manages about $200 million in equities at Motilal Oswal Asset
Management Co. in Mumbai, said in an interview to Bloomberg TV
India today.  Rupee Outlook  The  Reserve Bank of India  has since mid-July raised two
 interest rates , tightened lenders’ access to cash, increased
duty on precious metal imports, targeted foreign-currency
outflows and boosted efforts to lure investment to steady the
weakening currency.  UBS AG says a drop in the currency to 70 per dollar is
possible and Credit Suisse Group AG sees a decline to 65 as slow
growth and a record current-account deficit leave  Asia ’s third-biggest economy vulnerable to outflows and as the U.S. prepares
to pare monetary stimulus.  “The rupee is at the risk of completely losing its
anchor,”  Bhanu Baweja , the global head of emerging-market
cross-asset strategy at UBS AG, said in an interview with
Bloomberg TV India yesterday. “You’re in a situation where no
rupee forecast is sacrosanct.”  GDP Growth  The RBI estimates  India’s economy  may expand 5.5 percent in
the year ending March 2014, compared with 5 percent in the
previous 12-month period, the slowest in a decade. That trails
the 10-year average of about 8 percent, as well as the
performance of regional nations from Indonesia to the
Philippines.  The Sensex has lost 7 percent this year and  trades  at 12.8
times projected 12-month earnings, compared with the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index’s 9.9 times. The index’s 30-day
volatility rose to the highest since April 2012 yesterday.  International investors  sold a net $81 million of  Indian (SENSEX) 
shares on Aug. 16, data from the regulator show. That pared this
year’s inflow to $12.5 billion, the data show. Foreigners pulled
$3 billion from stocks and bonds last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
