Pattern Energy Group LP, a closely
held renewable energy company backed by private-equity investor
Riverstone Holdings LLC, began construction on a 218-megawatt
wind farm in Texas with financing from General Electric Co. and
 Citigroup Inc. (C)   The Panhandle Wind Project, about 30 miles (48 kilometers)
east of Amarillo, will use 118 GE turbines and is expected to be
complete in August 2014, San Francisco-based Pattern said today
in a statement. Terms werenâ€™t disclosed.  A Citigroup unit, Citigroup Energy, will buy the power
under a long-term agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
