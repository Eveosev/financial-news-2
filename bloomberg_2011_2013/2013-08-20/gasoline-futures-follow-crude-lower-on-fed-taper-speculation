Gasoline futures fell with crude as
speculation grew that the Federal Reserve will reduce bond
purchases, boosting interest rates and lowering investment
demand for commodities.  Futures sank as much as 1.2 percent, while West Texas
Intermediate crude dropped 1.8 percent. The Federal Reserve will
publish minutes of its July meeting tomorrow. Ten-year yields
have risen more than 20 basis points, or 0.2 percentage point,
this month on speculation the economy is strong enough to prompt
the central bank to slow stimulus as soon as its September
meeting.  “Certainly the macro move is out of commodities as the Fed
tapers and interest rates go up,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior
vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in New York. “Gasoline
has come off almost ten cents” since yesterday’s high, he said.  Gasoline for September delivery slipped 2.37 cents, or 0.8

Intermediate crude widened 59 cents to $16.69 a barrel. The
