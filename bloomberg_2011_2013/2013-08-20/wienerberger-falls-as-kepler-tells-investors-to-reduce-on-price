Wienerberger AG (WIE) , the world’s biggest
brickmaker, fell after analysts at Kepler, Berenberg and Davy
said the stock was overvalued following a monthlong rally.  S hares  fell 0.9 percent to 11.30 euros a share today in
Vienna. The stock has risen 27 percent since July and 67 percent
in the last 12 months, making it one of the best performers in
the 54-member Bloomberg EMEA Building Materials Index.  “We believe that the stock has already priced in a full
recovery in Europe, which we do not see yet,” wrote Vienna-based Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Stephan Trubrich in a research
note. He advised clients to stop holding the stock and to reduce
Wienerberger shares in their portfolios.  Wienerberger reported second-quarter earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 104.2 million
euros ($139 million) today. The company cut its Ebitda forecast
for 2013 by 20 million euros, to 260 million euros, last month
after a long winter and floods in central  Europe  weighed on
first-half profit.  Analysts at Berenberg and Davy also said that Wienerberger
shares look expensive in light of earnings. Analysts project an
8.85 euro average price target for the next 12 months,
suggesting a 19 percent downside potential, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
