Ethos Private Equity Ltd., South
Africa’s oldest buyout firm, is readying the sale of its stake
in retirement-fund administrator  Alexander Forbes Ltd. (AFP)   “We are gearing up for the Alex Forbes exit,” Ngalaah Chuphi, a partner at Ethos, said in a Johannesburg interview.
“We have done over 100 deals and exited 87 of them for cash.”  Alex Forbes, Africa’s largest such administrator, was
acquired for 8.2 billion rand ($806 million) in 2007 by a group
of investors including Ethos and Actis LLP. The deal was one of
the investments made by Ethos’ Fund V, which closed in 2006 and
was worth 5.5 billion rand. The fund has nine investments to
exit including resources company Idwala Industrial Holdings Ltd.  “We’ve seen a lot of inbound interest from international
companies,” Stuart MacKenzie, another Ethos partner in the Aug.
16 interview, said of interest in the Fund V investments.  Alex Forbes said in June it had hired Deutsche Bank AG and
Rand Merchant Bank to advise on a potential initial public
offering. Ethos is also hunting for new deals with fund VI,
worth $800 million, having closed in January.  “We will do 10 to 12 deals on fund VI,” Chuphi said.
“Fund VI can do 20 percent direct into  Africa . We want to
deploy $25 million to $40 million per deal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
