Saudi Arabia ’s housing ministry
commissioned 4 billion riyals ($ 1.1 billion) of housing
projects in seven cities including Jeddah, Dammam and Tabuk as
part of King Abdullah’s initiative to construct 500,000 homes.  The Dammam contract, valued at 1.1 billion riyals, is the
biggest of eight given out by the ministry, the ministry said in
a statement today. Saudi builder Al Yamama Trading & Contracting
Co. and Mapa Insaat ve Ticaret AS of  Turkey  won the contract for
that city.  Seven other companies won orders for the other six cities.
Kuwait’s Abdulmohsen Al Kharafi & Sons Trading & Contracting Co.
will build infrastructure in al-Qatif city.  The projects include infrastructure and construction works
for 40,000 housing units, the ministry said on Aug 18. The
housing, designed to accommodate 250,000 people, will be
completed in 18 to 24 months, Housing Minister Shuwaish Al-Duwaihi said in the statement.  The world’s largest oil exporter needs 2 million new homes
by 2014 to keep up with a population that’s quadrupled over 40
years. In 2011,  King Abdullah  promised to spend 250 billion
riyals on new homes as a wave of revolutions toppled leaders
from  Morocco  to Yemen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
