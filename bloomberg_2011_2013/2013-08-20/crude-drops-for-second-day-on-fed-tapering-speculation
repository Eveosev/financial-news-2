West Texas Intermediate crude fell
the most in two months amid speculation that the  Federal Reserve 
will reduce stimulus measures next month. WTI’s discount to
Brent widened by almost $2 a barrel.  Futures tumbled 2 percent as the September contract
expired. Minutes from the Fed’s July meeting, scheduled to be
published tomorrow, will probably provide details about
deliberations on when to taper $85 billion in monthly bond
buying. Brent rose as the entire September  North Sea  Ekofisk
loading plan was deferred.  “The market doesn’t seem to have any forward momentum and
the fear that the Fed could pull back is limiting the upside,”
said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy
in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Loadings in the North Sea
contributed to the widening Brent-WTI spread. Expiration
position squaring seemed to drive the market lower.”  WTI for September delivery dropped $2.14 to settle at
$104.96 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
biggest slide since June 20. The September contract expired at
the close of floor trading. The more-active October contract
decreased $1.75, or 1.6 percent, to $105.11. Trading volume was
30 percent above the 100-day average, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Prices were little changed after the  American Petroleum
Institute  was said to report crude inventories fell 1.2 million
barrels last week. The October contract dropped $1.74, or 1.6
percent, to $105.12 a barrel in electronic trading at 4:40 p.m.
It was $105.07 before the report was released at 4:30 p.m.  Contract Expiration  Brent for October settlement gained 25 cents, or 0.2
percent, to end the session at $110.15 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Volume was 2.3 percent below
100-day average. Brent’s premium over WTI grew $2.39 to $5.04 a
barrel, the widest level since June 28.  “Expiration is making the market more volatile,” said
Rich Ilczyszyn, chief market strategist and founder of
Iitrader.com in  Chicago . “You have folks that have to get out
of the September contract. We’ve got the Fed minutes coming
tomorrow.”  Central bankers and policy makers will gather Aug. 22 in
 Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , to discuss monetary policy. The Fed has
indicated an improving jobs market could spur cuts to their
monthly asset purchases. Fed Chairman  Ben Bernanke , whose term
ends in January, is not attending the conference.  Implied Volatility  “The trouble is, next January, Bernanke will be gone,”
said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence
Investment Management in  St. Louis , which oversees $1.4 billion.
“Markets hate uncertainty. Everything is short term and
everything is volatile.”  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
October was 22.3 percent, the highest level in almost six weeks,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed. It was 21.2 percent
yesterday.  The Fed will probably begin to reduce its monthly bond
purchases to $75 billion in September, according to 65 percent
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg from Aug. 9-13.  Brent rose as all 15 crude cargoes on the Ekofisk loading
program have been deferred, according to a revised schedule
obtained by Bloomberg. Three of the consignments will now load
in October, taking September exports down to 240,000 barrels a
day from 300,000 barrels in the original schedule.  Libyan Ports  Crude also dropped as  Libya  prepared to open some oil
terminals closed by labor unrest. The ports of Zueitina and
Hariga are ready to resume exports, Ibrahim Al Awami, an oil
ministry official, said today from Hariga. Another port, Brega,
was operational as of today, a union representative said. Among
other terminals, the country’s largest, Es Sider, remains
closed. The port has a capacity of 350,000 barrels of day.  “That Libya news is the catalyst here,” Ilczyszyn said.
“It’s shaking some of the longs out of the market.”  The country produced 800,000 barrels a day last month, half
the rate pumped a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg survey
of output from the 12-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. Libya holds  Africa ’s largest oil reserves.  U.S. crude stockpiles probably decreased 1.5 million
barrels to 359 million in the week ended Aug. 16, based on the
median of 11 analyst estimates before a report tomorrow from the
Energy Information Administration. That would be the lowest
level since Aug. 31.  “We have inventory reports coming in tomorrow,” McGillian
said. “People are looking for a catalyst to drive this market
higher or lower.”  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 739,374
contracts as of 4:41 p.m. It totaled 515,608 contracts
yesterday, 20 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.86 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
