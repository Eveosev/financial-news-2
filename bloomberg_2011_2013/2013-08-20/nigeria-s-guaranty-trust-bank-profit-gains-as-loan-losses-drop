Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY) , Nigeria’s
largest lender by market value, said first-half profit climbed
9.1 percent after loan losses declined by almost half.  Net income rose to 49 billion naira ($304 million) from
44.9 billion naira a year earlier, the Lagos-based lender said
in a  statement  published on the website of the  Nigerian Stock
Exchange  today. Bad-loan provisions fell to 1.3 billion naira,
while lending increased 15 percent to 899 billion naira.  Guaranty Trust plans to almost double loan growth to 20
percent this year and boost investments in oil and manufacturing
companies, Chief Executive Officer Segun Agbaje said in April.
The lender, which operates in six other countries on the
continent, agreed last month to pay about $100 million for 70
percent of  Kenya ’s Fina Bank Ltd. to tap growth in  East Africa .  “Profit after tax came in much better than expected,” FBN
Capital analysts led by Olubunmi Asaolu in Lagos, wrote in an e-mailed note. FBN Capital, which has a neutral recommendation on
Guaranty Trust shares, cited the bank’s lower-than-expected tax
rate of 8.4 percent.  Guaranty Trust shares advanced 1.1 percent to 25.3 naira at
2:45 p.m. in Lagos, bringing this year’s  gain  to 10 percent.
That compares with the 17 percent increase in the 10-member
Nigerian SE Banking Index.  Guaranty Trust’s British unit was fined 525,000 pounds
($815,000) on Aug. 9 by the U.K. markets regulator for failing
to have controls in place to prevent  money laundering . The bank
failed to document risk posed by higher-risk customers when it
set up a London office in 2008, the Financial Conduct Authority
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
