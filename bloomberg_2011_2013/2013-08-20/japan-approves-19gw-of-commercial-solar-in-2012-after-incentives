Japan  approved almost 19,000
megawatts of non-residential solar applications by the end of
the 2012 fiscal year, as part of the nationâ€™s incentive program
for clean energy started in July that year.  The country approved a total 21,090 megawatts of clean
energy projects, including 18,681 megawatts of non-residential
solar,  data  released today by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry showed. The approved projects also include residential
solar, wind and biomass.  Japan is projected to add the most solar capacity in the
world this year, boosted by above-market rates for clean energy.
The country is trying to diversify its energy sources after the
2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima.  Japan added 2,079 megawatts of clean energy capacity --
mostly solar -- in the fiscal year ended March 31, to a base of
about 20,000 megawatts, according to the ministry. In the two
months to May 31, Japan added another 1,280 megawatts, it said.  In March, applications for non-residential solar such as
utility-scale power plants and panels on factory rooftops jumped
to 7,669 megawatts, as developers rushed to file before the
incentives were cut from April. That compared with applications
worth 5,263 megawatts in February and 1,892 megawatts in
January, according to the ministry data.  Beginning April 1, the solar tariff payable by utilities
was reduced to 37.8 yen (39 cents) per kilowatt hour for 20
years, from 42 yen per kilowatt hour, reflecting lower equipment
and construction costs.  Clean energy producers need approval from both the trade
ministry and local utilities to qualify for the incentives.  Japan may add between 6,900 and 9,400 megawatts of solar
capacity this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg New
Energy Finance in June.  The ministry plans to conduct a survey on delayed non-residential projects as some of them have yet to start
construction after getting approval, according to its statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
