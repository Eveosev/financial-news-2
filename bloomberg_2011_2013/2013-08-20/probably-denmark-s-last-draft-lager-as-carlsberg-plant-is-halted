Bars in  Denmark  risk running out of
draft beer after a labor dispute caused production to be halted
at a brewery operated by  Carlsberg A/S. (CARLB)   The brewery, located in the town of Fredericia, produces
all of Carlsberg’s draft beer in Denmark, spokesman Jens Bekke
said today. Carlsberg estimates it controls about 70 percent of
the country’s draft beer market, he said.  Workers in a part of the brewery where beer is transferred
to kegs walked out Aug. 14 because a new hire isn’t affiliated
to a union that all other employees are, Bekke said. The 130
strikers are part of a total workforce of 800 at the site, he
said. Production of soft drinks is also affected.  Carlsberg has a stock of draft products lasting about a
week and customers usually hold one-to-two weeks of inventory,
Bekke said. The company has an option to substitute some of the
affected products with bottled beer, he said.  Labor laws prevent Carlsberg from asking whether or not a
person is part of a union when recruiting. Such laws also
prohibit the company from dismissing the worker. The Danish
labor court has ordered striking workers at the Fredericia plant
to be fined for every hour they are on strike.  “We hope they will go back,” Bekke said. It’s difficult
to see how the situation will be resolved otherwise, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
