Rentech Inc. (RTK) , a U.S. supplier of
wood pellets and nitrogen fertilizer, sold about 450 acres of
land in Mississippi where it had planned to build a renewable-energy project.  Adams County, Mississippi, paid $9 million for the land,
Los Angeles-based Rentech said in a statement yesterday. The
company shut in February its biofuel research unit that was
developing systems to convert cellulosic biomass into synthetic
gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
