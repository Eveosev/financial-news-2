The ringgit fell for a sixth day,
its longest losing streak since June 2012, on speculation funds
will pull money from  emerging markets  after Treasury yields
climbed to a two-year high.  Government bonds  retreated.  The rate on U.S. 10-year  notes  rose to 2.9 percent
yesterday, the most since July 2011, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It fell one basis point today. Malaysia’s current-account surplus probably narrowed to 900 million ringgit ($273
million) in the second quarter from 8.7 billion ringgit in the
previous three months, according to the median forecast of
economists in a Bloomberg survey before data due tomorrow.  “The depreciation in the ringgit is largely on the back of
the continual rise in U.S. Treasury yields,” said Khoon Goh, a
strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in
 Singapore . “There are some in the market who think Malaysia
could post a current-account deficit in the quarter.”  The ringgit weakened 0.4 percent to 3.2993 per dollar as of
10:27 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 3.3 earlier, the weakest since June 10,
2010. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, rose 124 basis points,
or 1.24 percentage points, to 9.81 percent.  Malaysia’s economy is likely to perform better in the
second half, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Abdul
Wahid Omar said in a Bloomberg TV interview today. Gross
domestic product probably expanded 4.7 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, after increasing 4.1 percent in the
previous three months, according to a Bloomberg survey before
data due tomorrow.  The yield on the 3.26 percent sovereign notes due March
2018 climbed two basis points to 3.56 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
