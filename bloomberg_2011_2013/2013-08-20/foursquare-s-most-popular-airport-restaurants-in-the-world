Could the world's most popular airport restaurant be a southern-and-sushi joint in the world's busiest hub? New data from Foursquare reveals some impressive taste among the flying public that too often has to settle for pre-made and flavorless fare. Topping the list is One Flew South, at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, where users rave about the "best airport food." While the ratings of millions of Foursquare users can't claim to be a scientific and comprehensive survey of the flying public's taste, the data does show adventuresome appetites in most airports.
