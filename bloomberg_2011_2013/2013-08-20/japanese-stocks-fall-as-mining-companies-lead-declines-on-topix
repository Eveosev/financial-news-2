Japan stocks fell, with the  Topix
index (TPX)  closing at its lowest level in more than seven weeks, as
investors withdrew from riskier assets across  Asia .  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  slumped 2.5 percent, its biggest drop
since July 29, contributing the most to the Topix’s  decline .
Daihatsu Motor Co., which counts  Indonesia  as its largest
overseas source of revenue, tumbled 6 percent after the
Southeast Asian country’s current-account deficit widened to a
record last quarter. Airport Facilities Co. climbed 3.7 percent,
extending yesterday’s surge after a report the government plans
a strategic zone to support businesses near Haneda Airport.  Equities slumped from  Tokyo  to Sydney, Jakarta and Mumbai
on concern that economies are weakening across the Asia-Pacific
region and the  Federal Reserve  will reduce its unprecedented
stimulus as soon as next month. The Topix sank 2.1 percent to
1,125.27 in Tokyo, its lowest close since June 27. The Nikkei
225 Stock Average declined 2.6 percent to 13,396.38.  “You can’t isolate Japan when you get a risk-off
environment,” said Nader Naeimi, head of dynamic  asset
allocation  at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages more
than $130 billion. Still, “Japan can outperform, helped by a
weaker yen.”  Japanese shares have led gains among developed markets in
2013 amid optimism that record stimulus by the  Bank of Japan  and
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic reforms will boost growth.
The yen has retreated 11 percent against the greenback this
year. The Topix dropped about 12 percent from its May 22 close,
which was the highest since 2008.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent
today. The measure yesterday capped its first four-day decline
this year as energy shares slumped and investors awaited signals
this week on the Federal Reserve’s stimulus plans.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will release minutes of
its July 30-31 meeting on Aug. 21. Investors and analysts will
be looking for clues on when central bankers plan to reduce $85
billion in monthly asset purchases. Officials will begin to trim
buying at their Sept. 17-18 meeting, according to 65 percent of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg on Aug. 9-13.  “The market is starting to price in the likelihood of
tapering by the U.S. Fed,”  Toshihiko Matsuno , a strategist at
Tokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co., a unit of Japan’s
second-biggest lender by market value, said by telephone.
“However, there is still optimism for Japan’s economy exiting
deflation.”  Toyota Slump  Exporters fell as the yen strengthened against the dollar
for the first time in three days. Toyota dropped 2.5 percent to
6,160 yen, the biggest single drag on the Topix. Honda Motor
Co., the second-biggest drag, slid 4.1 percent to 3,645 yen.
Sony Corp. lost 2.4 percent to 1,927 yen.  The Topix Mining Index declined 2.9 percent, its biggest
drop since July 29, as crude oil fell for a second day after
snapping the longest advance in almost four months.  Inpex Corp. (1605) ,
Japan’s biggest energy explorer, sank 3.2 percent to 426,000
yen. Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. slid 2.5 percent to 4,270
yen and Japan Drilling Co. decreased 1.9 percent to 6,640 yen.  An investor exodus from emerging markets that pushed
Indonesian equities into a  bear market  also drove some Japanese
shares lower. Indonesia’s currency,  stocks  and bonds plunged
after the current-account deficit widened to a record last
quarter. The Jakarta Composite Index has dropped 22 percent from
its record closing high on May 20.  Indonesian Sell-Off  Daihatsu, which gets 22 percent of its sales from
Indonesia, slumped 6 percent to 1,883 yen today. Suzuki Motor
Corp., which gets about 38 percent of sales from Asia including
Indonesia, sank 8 percent to 2,224 yen.  “Exporters with a high exposure to  emerging markets  such
as Indonesia and  China  are in a situation where they’re going to
be easily sold-off,” said Koji Uchida, chief  fund manager  at
Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.  Just 1.4 billion shares  traded hands  on the first section
of Japan’s stock exchange yesterday, the lowest level this year.
About 2 billion shares were traded today, below the 3.5 billion
average for 2013 as investors take summer vacations. The
measure’s 30-day  historic volatility  was at 25.87, compared with
its five-year median of 19.42.  Among stocks that rose, Airport Facilities, which builds
and leases aircraft hangars, climbed 3.7 percent to 765 yen
after rising as much as 19 percent during the day, the most on
record. The shares surged 16 percent yesterday after the Sankei
newspaper reported  Japan  is considering the strategic zone near
Haneda airport to help small and medium-sized manufacturers and
advanced medicine businesses, and to promote exports of Japan’s
pop culture such as animation.  The Topix traded at 1.18 times  book value  yesterday,
compared with 2.42 for the S&P 500 and 1.71 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
