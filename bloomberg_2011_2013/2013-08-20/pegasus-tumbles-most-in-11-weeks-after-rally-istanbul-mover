Pegasus Hava Tasimaciligi AS (PGSUS)  slumped
the most in 11 weeks as Ekspres Invest said a rally since the
stock started trading in April was overdone, prompting the
broker to downgrade the low-cost Turkish carrier to hold.  Pegasus  fell  5.8 percent, the steepest drop since June 6,
to 29.5 liras at the close in Istanbul. More than 2.4 million
shares changed hands, on par with the stock’s three-month daily
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  Borsa
Istanbul National 100 (XU100)  index lost 0.3 percent, falling to the
lowest close since July 11.  Pegasus, which offers flights to 71 destinations in Turkey
and abroad, soared 60 percent since its trading debut on April
26, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a drop
of 15 percent for the benchmark gauge in the period. Ekspres
lowered the  stock  to market perform, or the equivalent of hold,
from outperform, in an e-mailed note dated today.  “Profit-taking is only logical when we’re talking about a
stock that has performed so well,” Selim Kunter, an Istanbul-based analyst at Ekspres, said by phone.  Ekspres raised its price estimate on the shares to 34 liras
from 31.5 liras after Pegasus said yesterday second-quarter
profit climbed 49 percent to 53.3 million liras ($27 million).
That beat Kunter’s estimate of 51 million liras, according to
 data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares of Turkey’s second-biggest publicly traded carrier
are valued at 10.6 times estimated 12-month earnings, the  data 
show. That compares with 8.3 times for Istanbul-based  Turkish
Airlines (THYAO)  and 12.5 times for  Air Arabia PJSC (AIRARABI) , whose hub is in the
emirate of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
