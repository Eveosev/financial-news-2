Jordan will sell water from a
planned  Red Sea  desalination project to  Israel  in return for
about 50 million cubic meters of drinking water a year from the
Tiberias reservoir, the  Jordan Times  reported.  The kingdom will sell Israel water at a rate of 1 dinar
($1.41) a cubic meter and buy from the country at a rate of 0.3
dinar a cubic meter, the newspaper said, citing Prime Minister
Abdullah Ensour. The arrangement will help save Jordan the cost
of conveying water from the south to the northern governorates
of Irbid, Jerash, Ajloun and Mafraq, he said.  Jordan, one of the worldâ€™s driest countries, will seek bids
this year for a $980 million project to transfer water from the
Red Sea to a desalination plant with capacity of 200 million
cubic meters a year, the newspaper reported, citing Minister of
Water and Irrigation Hazem al-Nasser.  A pipeline will be built from the plant in Wadi Araba to
the  Dead Sea  to discharge the brine. Jordan plans to get $300
million to $400 million in grants for the venture, al-Nasser
said, according to the Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
