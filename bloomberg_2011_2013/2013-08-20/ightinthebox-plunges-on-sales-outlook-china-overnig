LightInTheBox Holding Co. (LITB)  led a
decline in Chinese online retailers traded in  New York  as the e-commerce company forecast a drop in third-quarter sales after
revenue disappointed.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. fell 0.4 percent to 96.06 yesterday.
LightInTheBox tumbled 40 percent as volume surged. Online
bookseller  E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG)  sank to a four-week
low, while web fashion retailer  Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS)  slid for
the first time in three days. Game operator Perfect World Co.
plunged the most since March on lower-than-estimated earnings.  Beijing-based LightInTheBox, which sells lifestyle goods to
overseas markets, reported second-quarter revenue of $72.2
million, 4.7 percent short of the average estimate of four
analysts compiled by Bloomberg, and  forecast sales  that missed
projections by as much as 14 percent. Credit Suisse Group AG
downgraded the company’s rating to the equivalent of sell
yesterday. The stock has rallied 22 percent since its initial
public offering in June.  “They missed the top line and there was a quarter-to-quarter growth decline which people weren’t expecting,” Eric Brock, who helps oversee $4.2 billion as a portfolio manager at
Clough Capital Partners, said by phone from  Boston . “The stock
has been running up quite a bit in the last month or so. The
long-term outlook for  China ’s e-commerce sector is still
favorable.”  ETF Slides  The iShares China Large-Cap  ETF (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., dropped 1.4 percent to a one-week low of $35.57. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.4
percent as retailers’ results surpassed estimates and investors
awaited signals on stimulus measures from the  Federal Reserve .  LightInTheBox’s shares sank to $11.58, the steepest slump
since its debut June 6. Trading volume was 12 times the 90-day
average, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  The company estimated third-quarter sales to be between $68
million and $70 million, lower than revenues in the previous
three months. Second-quarter net income of $648,000 compared
with the mean projection of $1.8 million by two analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  LightInTheBox traded at 34 times forward profit before
plunging yesterday, which was “an expensive valuation,” Credit
Suisse analyst Eva Wang said in a note, lowering her earnings
forecast and the target price for the stock to $14 from $16.50.
The rating was cut from neutral.  Dangdang, Vipshop  Beijing-based Dangdang, the country’s biggest web
bookseller, slumped 7.7 percent to $8.46, the lowest level since
July 24. Dangdang’s American depositary receipts have climbed
104 percent this year. Vipshop, based in Guangzhou, fell 4.3
percent to $41.37, paring its surge this year to 132 percent.  Perfect World, based in  Shanghai , slid 7.9 percent to
$18.99 in New York, the largest slump in five months. Trading
volume was triple the three-month average.  The company reported Aug. 19 adjusted earnings of 33 cents
per ADR, trailing the 36-cent average projection of four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , China’s third-largest panel maker, raised
its 2013 annual shipment estimate by 14 percent after sales
climbed to a record in the second quarter on Asian demand.  ADRs of the Changzhou-based company surged 15 percent to
$7.82 in New York, rallying the most in three months.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slipped 2.9 percent
to 9,905.76, sinking the most in seven weeks. The  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slumped 0.6 percent to 2,072.59, after rising
0.8 percent the previous day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
