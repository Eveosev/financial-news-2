South African wheat futures rose to
a two-week high as the rand weakened against the dollar, making
imports of the grain more expensive.  Wheat for delivery in December, the most active contract,
gained 0.2 percent to 3,350 rand ($330) a metric ton by the
close on the South African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg.
That was the highest level since Aug. 2.  The rand slumped to a six-week low after foreign investors
 sold  a net 1.94 billion rand of South African bonds yesterday,
the most in a session since June 25, JSE Ltd. data show.  “Wheat was up mostly because of the rand weakening
substantially,” Brink Van Wyk, a trader from BVG (Pty) Ltd.,
said in an e-mailed response to questions.  South Africa , a net importer of wheat, is sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s largest producer of the grain after  Ethiopia  and the
region’s biggest buyer after Nigeria and  Sudan , according to
U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  South Africa raised the dollar-based reference price for
local output of wheat by 37 percent in April, increasing the
level at which duties on imported grain have to be paid.  White and yellow corn for delivery in December were little
changed at respective prices of 2,343.20 rand and 2,195 rand a
ton. South Africa is the continent’s leading grower of the
grain. A meal made from white corn is one of the nation’s staple
foods and yellow corn is mainly used as  animal feed .  To contact the reporter on this story:
