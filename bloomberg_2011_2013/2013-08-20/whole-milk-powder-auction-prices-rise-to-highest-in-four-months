Whole milk powder auction prices
rose to the highest in four months, recovering after a decline
two weeks ago amid a contamination scare, according to Fonterra
Cooperative Group Ltd.  Powder for delivery across all contracts through February
rose 2.7 percent, according to a trade-weighted index posted on
Fonterraâ€™s GlobalDairyTrade website. The average winning price
climbed to $5,124 a metric ton, the highest since April 16, from
$5,021 at the last auction two weeks ago.  Prices dropped 1.6 percent on Aug. 6 after Auckland-based
Fonterra revealed that some whey protein made at a New Zealand
plant may have been contaminated, prompting product recalls and
an import ban in  China . No products offered in the auctions were
affected by the trade suspension.  Fonterra, which accounts for about a third of the global
trade in dairy products, sells whole, skim and butter-milk
powder, dried-milk fat, lactose, butter, cheese and casein at
its GlobalDairyTrade auctions. Casein is a protein found in
milk. Prices across all products rose 2.3 percent.  The company has signaled it will offer less milk powder at
auctions over the next 12 months, underpinning prices, Con Williams, an economist at ANZ Banking Group Ltd. in Wellington,
said in an e-mailed note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
