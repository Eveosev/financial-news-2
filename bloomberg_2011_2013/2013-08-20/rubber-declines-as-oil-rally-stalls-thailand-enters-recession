Rubber declined the most in three
weeks as a drop in oil reduced the prospects for gains in
competing synthetic products, and as  Thailand  entered a
recession for the first time since 2009.  Rubber for delivery in January on  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange
fell 2.1 percent to settle at 260.8 yen a kilogram ($2,685 a
metric ton), the most for a most-active contract since July 29.
Futures have declined 14 percent this year.  West Texas Intermediate crude fell for the first time in
seven days yesterday and extended declines today. Asian stocks
dropped for a fourth day as Thailand, the largest rubber
producer, entered a recession and India’s currency tumbled to a
record low.  “As emerging economies showed signs of weakening, concerns
grew over rubber demand,” said Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at
research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo.  Rubber for delivery in January fell 1.9 percent to close at
19,470  yuan  ($3,180) a ton on the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange.
Natural-rubber inventories increased 4,457 tons to 122,645 tons,
the highest level since February 2010, the bourse said on Aug.
16 based on a survey of nine warehouses in Shanghai, Shandong,
Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin.  Thai rubber free-on-board dropped 0.6 percent to 81.25 baht
($2.56) a kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
