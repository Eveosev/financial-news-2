weaken to 3.30 per dollar by year-end from earlier estimate of
3.15, HSBC analysts  Paul Mackel , Dominic Bunning and  Ju Wang 
write in report released late yesterday.
* Apart from narrowing current-account surplus, pick-up in
domestic outflows leaves MYR more vulnerable to volatility in
portfolio flows which supported currency through 2012: Report
* Key area to watch is increasing offshore investments made by
Malaysiaâ€™s Employees Provident Fund and similar funds: Report
* Outflows may reach 40 billion ringgit ($12 billion) in 2013
if, as was reported earlier, EPF wants to increase proportion of
offshore investments from around 17% in 2012 to 21%-23% this
year: Report
* NOTE: MYR has fallen 7% to 3.288 per dollar this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg
* NOTE: HSBC first published the change in its MYR forecast on
July 31 and it was compiled into its global research report on
currency strategy on  emerging markets  released yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
