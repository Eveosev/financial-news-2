QBE Insurance Group Ltd. (QBE) ,
 Australia ’s largest insurer by market value, fell the most in
nine months after reporting a 37 percent drop in first-half net
income and halving its dividend.  QBE  shares  closed in Sydney 5.5 percent lower at A$16.10,
declining the most since Nov. 13 and cutting gains for the year
to 48 percent.  Net income  fell to $477 million in the six months
to June 30 as premiums dropped in North America and it set aside
more for unresolved claims. The profit missed a $555 million
median estimate of seven analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  Chief Executive Officer John Neal, who took over a year
ago, is cutting costs by reducing jobs and simplifying processes
at the insurer, which has made 135 acquisitions in the past 30
years to expand to 48 countries. He plans to save at least $250
million annually by 2015 through a restructuring program that
the company estimates will cost $156 million this year.  “We were expecting less of a decline, and our full year
2013 $1.39 billion net profit forecast is under review,”  David Ellis , a Sydney-based analyst at  Morningstar Inc. (MORN) , said in an e-mailed note. “The restructuring and rebuilding work continues
and we remain confident of the long-term turnaround in earnings
and dividends.”  QBE in February wrote off $407 million for amortization and
impairments largely on its U.S. operation pushing it to miss its
full-year profit forecast, filings show.  Dividend Halves  QBE said its board had taken a “conservative view” in
deciding to retain net income as capital, paying out 37 percent
of its cash profit in dividends. Its stated policy has been to
pay out as much as 50 percent of annual cash profit. The interim
dividend of 20 cents per share is down from 40 cents a year
earlier.  Gross written premiums from the insurer’s North American
operations dropped 16 percent to $2.7 billion. “Plans are under
way to rebuild our premium base in the specialist U.S. lender
placed insurance business,” Neal said in today’s statement.  Reflecting the weakness in  North America , QBE cut its gross
written premium target for the year to between $17.5 billion and
$18 billion from its earlier forecast of $18.5 billion to $19
billion.  The insurer said today it was “disappointed” in having to
set aside $178 million for prior year claims, reflecting
additional costs from its businesses in  Argentina ,  Italy  and
North America, Neal said during a media conference call.  QBE’s latest result also includes a loss of $24 million on
its fixed-income investments in the first half compared with a
gain of $259 million a year earlier when it revalued its bond
portfolio.  The insurer expects an insurance profit margin of 11
percent for the full year after a margin of 10.8 percent in the
first half, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
