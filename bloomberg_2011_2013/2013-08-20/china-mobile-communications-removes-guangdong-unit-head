China Mobile Communications Corp.,
the state-owned parent of the world’s largest phone company by
users, removed the head of its Guangdong unit who is under
investigation.  Xu Long was removed as general manager, chairman, and
Communist Party Secretary for the carrier’s Guangdong unit amid
a probe of “a serious violation of discipline,” China Mobile
Communications said in an e-mail today from spokesman Zhang
Xuan. Xu is under investigation by “the relevant departments”
Zhang said, without supplying details.  China began a corruption probe of more than 60 executives
at the nation’s three wireless carriers in June 2011, the
official Xinhua news agency reported at the time. That probe,
involving 350 million  yuan  ($57 million) of illegal funds, led
the operators to adjust their business policies “to reduce the
corruption risk,” Xinhua said.  Zhang’s e-mail didn’t say if the investigation of Xu was
connected to the 2011 probe, and contact details for Xu couldn’t
immediately be located.  Xu had resigned as an executive director of the Hong Kong-listed  China Mobile Ltd. (941)  on Dec. 14, according to the company’s
annual report.  Shares of China Mobile rose 0.3 percent to HK$84.15 at
11:15 a.m. in Hong Kong trading. The  shares  have declined 6.8
percent so far this year, exceeding the 1.2 percent drop in the
benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  China Mobile Communications is a state-owned entity that is
the controlling shareholder of China Mobile through a 74 percent
stake.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
