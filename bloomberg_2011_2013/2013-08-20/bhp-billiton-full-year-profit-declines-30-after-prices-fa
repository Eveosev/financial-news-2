BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
biggest mining company, said full-year profit slumped 30 percent
after prices declined.  Net income  dropped to $10.9 billion in the year to June 30
from $15.4 billion a year ago, the Melbourne-based company said
today in a statement. Profit, excluding one-time items, was
$11.8 billion, compared with $17.2 billion a year ago. That
missed a median forecast of $12.7 billion of seven analyst
surveyed by Bloomberg.  BHP joins Rio Tinto Group and Vale SA in reporting a
decline in profit as slowing economic growth in  China  saps
demand for raw materials, dragging down prices. BHP Chief
Executive Officer  Andrew Mackenzie  is targeting an 18 percent
drop in  capital spending  this fiscal year as investors including
 BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  pressure mining companies to defer expansions,
new mines and acquisitions after the industry was hurt by more
than $60 billion in writedowns.  “The equity market is looking for the miners to cut
spending and increase returns,”  Glyn Lawcock , a Sydney-based
analyst for UBS AG, said in a report before the results. “It’s
been a tough year for BHP.”  BHP fell 1.4 percent to A$36.54 at the close of trading in
Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
