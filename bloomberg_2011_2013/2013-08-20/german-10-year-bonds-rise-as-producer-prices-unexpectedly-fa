German bonds rose, with 10-year
yields falling from the highest levels in almost 17 months, amid
speculation Federal Reserve minutes tomorrow will signal policy
makers are moving toward reducing bond purchases.  Austrian, Dutch and French government securities also
rallied as European stocks declined and a report showed German
producer prices unexpectedly fell in July, reviving demand for
safer assets. Spain’s 10-year bonds dropped for a second day as
the nation sold 4.15 billion euros ($5.57 billion) of bills.
Greek bonds slumped before European Central Bank Executive Board
member Joerg Asmussen visits  Athens  tomorrow.  “It’s just a pullback because the yield move in recent
days has been very dynamic,” said Christian Reicherter, an
analyst at DZ Bank AG based in Frankfurt. “Everybody is
expecting that the Fed will announce that they will lower their
buying of bonds. Speculation intensified in recent days.”  Germany ’s 10-year yield fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.84 percent at 4:23 p.m. London time after
climbing to 1.92 percent yesterday, the  highest  since March 27,
2012. The 1.5 percent bund due in May 2023 rose 0.52, or 5.20
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 97.02.  Austrian  10-year yields  declined four basis points to 2.27
percent, while similar-maturity Dutch rates fell three basis
points to 2.27 percent and  France (GFRN10) ’s dropped four basis points to
2.40 percent.  Fed Minutes  Minutes of the Fed’s July 30-31 meeting may indicate when
policy makers plan to starting reducing their monthly debt
purchases of $85 billion. Officials will probably begin to trim
the buying next month, according to 65 percent of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg from Aug. 9-13.  German  producer prices  dropped 0.1 percent last month after
being unchanged in June, the Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted an
increase of 0.2 percent.  Volatility on German bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of  Austria  and the Netherlands,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Spanish bonds fell as demand declined at today’s bill
auction. The nation sold 12-month bills at an average yield of
1.253 percent, down from 1.503 percent on July 16. Investors bid
for 2.02 times the securities on offer, compared to 2.61 times
last month. Demand also declined at the six-month bill sale.  Spain ’s  10-year yield  climbed seven basis points to 4.48
percent after rising five basis points yesterday. The rate on
similar-maturity Italian bonds added four basis points to 4.32
percent.  Greek Bonds  Greek 10-year yields jumped the most in seven weeks as an
ECB spokesman said Asmussen will travel to Athens to discuss the
country’s adjustment program with policy makers.  Asmussen will hold bilateral meetings with Greek policy
makers, a spokesman said.  Greece ’s  10-year yield  climbed 28 basis points to 10
percent, the biggest daily increase since July 3.  German 10-year bund futures may struggle to extend
yesterday’s decline after the contract dropped to a 10-month low
of 139.71 yesterday, according to analysts at Helaba Hessen-Thueringen led by Ralf Umlauf in  Frankfurt . The contract
expiring in September rose 0.5 percent to 140.65 today.  “A consolidation is possible today due to a lack of
fundamental influences, with the latest lows at 139.71/72
forming the first support on the downside,” the analysts wrote
in e-mailed note. “Price movements below this would create
potential for a fall to 139.45.” Support refers to an area
where buy orders may be clustered.  Germany is scheduled to sell 5 billion euros of two-year
notes tomorrow. The nation last auctioned similar-maturity debt
on July 10 at an average yield of 0.07 percent, compared with
0.18 percent at a previous sale on June 12.  The rate on two-year notes maturing in June 2015 dropped
two basis points to 0.21 percent today.  German bonds lost 2.4 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Austrian securities
dropped 1.8 percent, while Spain’s returned 8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
