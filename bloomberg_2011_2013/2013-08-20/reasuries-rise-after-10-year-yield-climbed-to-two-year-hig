Treasuries rose for the first time
in four days on speculation a withdrawal of stimulus by the
 Federal Reserve  may hurt weakening emerging economies, stoking
demand for the safety of  U.S. government debt .  Ten-year benchmark yields  dropped from the highest level in
more than two years after a technical indicator used by some
traders suggested a reversal was imminent. Emerging-market
stocks fell the most in six weeks as Indonesian shares extended
a slump and currencies from  Thailand  to  India  weakened on
concern capital outflows will accelerate.  “There’s been a lot of rumblings in the emerging space --
concerns for tapering and the impact there,” said  Sean Murphy ,
a trader at  Societe Generale  SA in  New York , one of the 21
primary dealers that trade with the U.S. central bank. “We have
seen money go to work on the pullback.”  The U.S.  10-year yield  fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 2.81 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.5 percent
benchmark note due in August 2023 rose 18/32, or $5.63 per
$1,000 face amount, to 97 9/32. The yield climbed to 2.90
percent yesterday, the highest level since July 2011.  Yields have jumped more than 20 basis points this month on
speculation the  U.S. economy  is strong enough to prompt the
central bank to slow stimulus as soon as its September meeting.
The Fed publishes minutes of its July meeting tomorrow.
Investors withdrew $8.4 billion from emerging-market exchange-traded funds this year amid a selloff.  Jackson Hole  Central bankers and policy makers will gather Aug. 22 in
 Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , to discuss the global economy and
monetary policy.  Treasuries have lost investors 3.8 percent as of yesterday,
according to Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index. The securities
returned 2.2 percent in 2012.  “We’ve sold off so much of late that value buyers are
coming in,” said Matthew Duch, a  fund manager  in Bethesda,
 Maryland , at Calvert Investments, which oversees more than $12
billion in assets. “The Fed minutes could be telling and give
the market direction.”  The Fed’s first step may be to reduce debt purchases next
month by $10 billion to a $75 billion pace, according to a
Bloomberg survey concluded last week.  Fed policy makers led by Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  are
contemplating how to end a third round of quantitative easing
that has swelled the  Fed’s balance sheet  to a record $3.65
trillion. The central bank will end purchases in mid-2014,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 48
economists conducted Aug. 9-13. The Fed next meets Sept. 17-18.  The Fed purchased $942 million in securities maturing from
November 2024 to February 2031.  Relative Strength  An indicator of momentum used by some dealers signaled that
Treasuries are oversold. The 14-day  relative-strength index  for
the 10-year yield rose above the 70 threshold yesterday that
indicates it has climbed too much. The last time it exceeded
that level was July 5, which was followed by a two-week rally.  ‘The only way you get lower yields is if the Fed comes out
and delays taper for months, but the Fed isn’t going to do
that,” said  Jim Bianco , president of Bianco Research LLC in
Chicago.  The 10-year rate will end the year at 2.71 percent,
according to a Bloomberg survey of 66 analysts with the most
recent forecasts given the heaviest weighting. The yield will
rise to 3 percent in the second quarter of next year, a separate
survey shows.  The Fed has kept its  target  for overnight lending between
banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.
Investors see a 53 percent chance policy makers will raise the
so-called federal funds rate to 0.5 percent or more by January
2015, data compiled by Bloomberg from futures show.  Jobless Rate  Policy makers repeated in a July statement that the current
range will be appropriate for at least as long as the
 unemployment rate  is above 6.5 percent and inflation between one
and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half
percentage point above the bank’s 2 percent target.  The  jobless rate  was 7.4 percent as of July. The Fed’s
preferred inflation gauge showed prices rising 1.3 percent in
the 12 months through June.  “The reality is most are waiting for payroll confirmation
that tapering will begin,” said Murphy of Societe Generale in
New York. “Plus-200,000 should confirm that the Fed has plenty
of room to begin paring back on their purchases.”  Volatility as measured by the Merrill Lynch Option
Volatility Estimate MOVE  Index (BUSY)  increased to 99.48 yesterday, the
most since July 9, before slipping today to 95.70. The average
for 2013 is 68.15.  To contact the reporters on this story:
