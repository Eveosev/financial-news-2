Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the largest
subscription streaming service, rose to the highest in more than
two years after signing a multiyear accord for exclusive rights
to movies from the Weinstein Co.  Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, gained 5.2 percent
to $273.29 at the close in New York. The stock has almost
 tripled  this year and is approaching the all-time closing high
of $298.73 set in July 2011.  With the deal, Netflix obtains exclusive pay-television
rights to Weinstein and Dimension films starting with pictures
released in theaters in 2016, the companies said today in a
statement. Other terms weren’t released. Netflix also has film
streaming arrangements with Walt Disney Co. and  DreamWorks
Animation SKG Inc. (DWA)   Netflix is combining original programming, such as the
women’s prison series “Orange Is the New Black,” with first-run and library films to sustain new subscriber growth and
finance foreign expansion. The company reported 630,000 new
domestic streaming customers in the second quarter, for a total
of 28.6 million paid U.S. subscribers.  The company already carries some documentaries and foreign
films from closely held Weinstein, the New York-based film
company owned by brothers Harvey and  Bob Weinstein . Those
include the Oscar winning best picture “The Artist,” according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
