Corn fell from a three-week high as
field samples taken on farms in  South Dakota  and  Ohio  bolstered
prospects for a record harvest in the U.S., the world’s largest
grower and exporter. Soybeans and wheat dropped.  Corn yields in South Dakota will more than double to an
average of 161.75 bushels an acre from 74 during the drought of
2012, participants in the annual Professional Farmers of America
Midwest Crop Tour said yesterday, after examining fields in the
state. Inspections of farms in Ohio led to estimates of 171.6
bushels an acre, on average, up from 110.5 in 2012. The U.S.
government has forecast a record harvest of 13.76 billion
bushels, sending prices down 32 percent this year.  “If you’re telling me the yield is good in the best
production region of the country, then that’s really not
bullish,” Ken Smithmier, a grains analyst at the Hightower
Report in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “I don’t see
anything at the moment that says we need to bust out of this
bearish trend and move higher.”  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 2.1 percent to
settle at $4.755 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after touching $4.8675, the highest since July 24. Prices
yesterday rallied 4.7 percent on concern that crop conditions
were eroding.  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 1 percent to
$12.905 a bushel in Chicago. The price is down 8.4 percent in
2013. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  on Aug. 12 forecast a
production increase of 8 percent this year to 3.255 billion
bushels.  Wheat futures for December delivery lost 1.1 percent to
$6.46 a bushel on the CBOT. The grain has fallen 17 percent this
year, partly on speculation global production would increase.  To contact the reporters on this story:
