The NYSE Amex Options exchange is
reviewing “a large number” of erroneous transactions from the
start of trading today, the company said in a statement.  Trades in tickers beginning with letters H through L in the
first 17 minutes are being examined, the  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  unit
said. Amex earlier reported “systems issues” and asked that
orders from the platform be removed from marketwide price
quotes, a system known as the national best bid and offer.
Options venues run by Nasdaq OMX Group Inc., Bats Global Markets
Inc. and  CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE)  routed orders away the exchange.
Amex said systems were back to normal by 9:49 a.m. in New York.  “NYSE Amex Options is reviewing a large number of
erroneous executions that took place this morning,” the
exchange said in a note to traders. “As permitted by the rules,
we anticipate that most of the impacted trades will be busted.”  CBOE, the largest options exchange,  said  it is reviewing
all trades that occurred between 9:30 and 9:41 a.m. today.
 Nasdaq  is  reviewing  options transactions from 9:30 to 9:47 a.m.,
according to its website.  NYSE Euronext briefly halted trading yesterday in about 40
exchange-traded funds and notes when the securities were added
to a program aimed at curbing sudden price swings. They were set
off during implementation of the protocol known as limit
up/limit down that pauses securities when bid-ask spreads become
too wide, NYSE Euronext said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
