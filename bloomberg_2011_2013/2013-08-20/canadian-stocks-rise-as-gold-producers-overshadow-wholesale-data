Canadian  stocks  rose, following the
biggest drop since June yesterday, as gold producers advanced to
a four-month high to overshadow data showing a decline in the
nation’s wholesale sales.  Semafo Inc. soared 13 percent to pace gains among gold
producers.  Kinross Gold Corp. (K)  and B2Gold Corp. rose at least 3.9
percent.  Silver Wheaton (SLW)  Corp. climbed 3.2 percent as silver
trimmed earlier losses. Bombardier Inc. fell 1.5 percent,
dropping for a second day. Paladin Energy Ltd. slumped 5.1
percent after analysts lowered their ratings for the stock.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 82.09
points, or 0.7 percent, to 12,670.11 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
index has gained 1.9 percent this year. Trading volume was 5.1
percent lower than the 30-day average.  “The gold sector is stronger and energy names are mixed,
although crude at $105 a barrel isn’t what I’d call disastrous
either,” said John O’Connell, chief executive officer with
Davis Rea Ltd. in Toronto. The firm manages about C$600 million
($577 million). “You’re seeing some flow back into gold because
it’s one of those areas that has been beaten up a lot.”  Gold gained for the fourth time in five sessions, rising
0.5 percent to $1,372.60 an ounce in  New York . Gold stocks in
 Canada  have slumped 28 percent this year as the price of the
metal heads for the worst annual drop since 1997.  Precious Metals  Semafo jumped 13 percent to C$2.49, the most since May
2012, Kinross Gold rallied 3.9 percent to C$6.14 and B2Gold
jumped 6.1 percent to C$3.13 as 23 of 24 members of the S&P/TSX
Gold Index increased. The index climbed 3.5 percent to the
highest close since April 11.  Silver Wheaton advanced 3.2 percent to C$28.36 and
Silvercorp Metals Inc. rose 4 percent to C$3.90 as the price of
silver fell 0.4 percent after paring earlier losses of as much
as 3.9 percent.  Canadian wholesale sales fell in June from a record the
previous month with declines in every major category, adding to
signs of a mid-year slowdown in the world’s 11th largest
economy.  “Growth is forecast to recover over the second half of the
year in tandem with a stronger outlook for the  United States ,”
said  David Tulk , Chief Canada macro strategist with TD
Securities Inc. in Toronto, in a note after the report.
“Allowing net exports to take over the mantle of growth will
take some of the pressure off of the fatigued domestic economy
and provide comfort to the  Bank of Canada  that, even if sluggish
by historical standards, the recovery remains on track.”  The Canadian economy is forecast to slow to 1.6 percent in
the second quarter from 2.5 percent in the first before
accelerating to 2.1 percent growth in each of the next two
quarters, according to economists’ estimates.  Bank Stocks  Royal Bank of Canada, the nation’s largest lender, added 1
percent to C$64.67, for the highest close in three weeks. The
S&P/TSX Financials Index climbed 0.7 percent.  Bombardier, based in  Montreal , lost 1.5 percent to C$4.72.
The stock has lost 3.3 percent in the past two days, after
National Bank analyst  Cameron Doerksen  said in a note yesterday
the company’s CSeries jet may have its entry into service
delayed to early 2015 from September 2014. The CSeries jet has
yet to take its maiden flight.  Paladin Energy, which explores for uranium in  Australia  and
Southern Africa, sank 5.1 percent to 56 Canadian cents, a record
low according to data compiled by Bloomberg, after Matthew Keane, analyst with Argonaut Securities Pty Ltd. and Glyn Lawcock, analyst with UBS AG, both lowered their ratings for the
stock to hold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
