U.K.  government bonds  rose, with 10-year gilts advancing for the first time in seven days, as a
slide in stocks around the world revived demand for the relative
safety of Britain’s fixed-income securities.  Benchmark  10-year yields  dropped from the highest level
since August 2011 amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  will
reduce its asset purchases that have helped underpin the global
recovery. Treasuries and German bonds also rallied. Britain sold
1.75 billion pounds ($2.74 billion) of inflation-linked gilts.
The pound strengthened to a two-month high against the dollar
and weakened versus the euro.  “It’s generally a risk-off day,” said Owen Callan, an
analyst at Danske Bank A/S in Dublin. “Equity markets are
taking quite a significant pullback, probably leading most of
this move in the fixed-income world, especially in the U.S.”  The U.K.  10-year yield  fell eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 2.67 percent at 4:37 p.m. London time after
climbing to 2.75 percent yesterday, the highest since Aug. 8,
2011. The 1.75 percent gilt due in September 2022 rose 0.595, or
5.95 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 92.66.  Treasury 10-year yields  dropped six basis points to 2.82
percent, while similar-maturity  bund yields  declined six basis
points to 1.84 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index of shares
slid 08 percent.  Fed Minutes  The Fed will publish tomorrow the minutes of its July 30-31
meeting that may offer clues about when policy makers will start
to reduce their $85 billion of monthly bond purchases. Officials
will begin to trim the buying in September, according to 65
percent of economists surveyed by Bloomberg from Aug. 9-13.  The U.K. sold inflation-linked gilts due in November 2019
at an average real yield of minus 0.887 percent, drawing bids
for 1.83 times the amount auctioned. A negative real yield means
investors receive a return below inflation if they hold the
securities to maturity.  The five-year  break-even rate , a gauge of market inflation
expectations derived from the yield difference between gilts and
index-linked securities, declined for a third day, dropping
three basis points to 2.66 percentage points. The rate fell to
2.64 percentage points on Aug. 12, the lowest since July 2.  The Debt Management Office  said  today it is planning at
least one gilt sale through banks in the fourth quarter. The DMO
will publish its gilt-sale calendar for next quarter on Aug. 30.  Gilts lost investors 4.7 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German
bonds dropped 2.4 percent and Treasuries declined 3.8 percent.  The pound strengthened 0.2 percent to $1.5673 after
advancing to $1.5696, the highest level since June 18. The U.K.
currency weakened 0.5 percent to 85.66 pence per euro.  Sterling has appreciated 5.7 percent in the past six
months, the best performer of 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro rose
3.6 percent and the dollar strengthened 2.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
