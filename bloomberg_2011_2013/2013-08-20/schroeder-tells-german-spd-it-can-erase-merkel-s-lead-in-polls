Former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
said his Social Democratic Party can close Angela Merkel’s lead
in the polls in the final weeks of  Germany ’s election campaign
just as he did in 2005.  “That was just about the same situation as now: the
opinion polls put us at less than 30 percent,” Schroeder told a
campaign rally in Detmold today with the SPD’s chancellor
candidate,  Peer Steinbrueck . “Many people were writing
‘Schroeder, you don’t even need to run.’”  Steinbrueck, who was Merkel’s finance minister during her
first term, trails the chancellor in polls as she seeks a third
term in elections on Sept. 22. In 2005, Schroeder narrowed
Merkel’s lead of about 14 percentage points at a similar stage
in the campaign to 1 percentage point on Election Day. While he
failed to prevent her from winning the chancellorship, he forced
her into a “grand coalition” with his party.  Schroeder, 69, strove to fire up his party’s campaign at
the joint rally with Steinbrueck in western Germany, saying
Merkel was leading Germany back into the era of Helmut Kohl with
proposals such as benefits for women who stay at home to raise
children. The Social Democrats lag Merkel’s Christian Democratic
bloc by as many as 17 percentage points in the six major German
party polls.  “Peer, beat your drum and don’t be scared,” Schroeder
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
