New Zealand cricketer Jesse Ryder
was suspended for six months after testing positive to banned
substances contained in a weight-loss supplement, the Sports
Tribunal of New Zealand said.  The 29-year-old Ryder, who hasn’t played professional
cricket since he was assaulted outside a Christchurch bar on
March 28, tested positive after a domestic one-day match four
days earlier, the tribunal said in an e-mailed  statement .  Ryder escaped a mandatory two-year ban for an anti-doping
violation because the tribunal said it accepted his argument
that he wasn’t aware the over-the-counter dietary supplement
contained banned substances and that he did not take it with the
intention of enhancing his performance.  “As Mr. Ryder was able to establish how the substances got
in his system, and that he didn’t intend to enhance his sports
performance, he was eligible for a lesser penalty,” the
tribunal said. “The tribunal therefore had to assess his degree
of fault in the circumstances.”  Ryder admitted the violation and stated he had been using
the supplement, which didn’t list any prohibited substances on
its label, to lose weight and had taken two capsules five days
before being tested, the tribunal added.  Ryder, who last represented New Zealand’s national team in
February 2012, is eligible to play again on Oct. 19 as his ban
was backdated to April 19, when he was provisionally suspended.  To contact the reporter on this story:
