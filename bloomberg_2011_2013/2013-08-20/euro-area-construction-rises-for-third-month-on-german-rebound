Construction output  in the euro area
rose for a third month in June, driven by a rebound in  Germany ,
as the 17-nation currency bloc emerged from a record-long
recession.  Construction in the  euro zone  increased 0.7 percent from
May, when it gained 0.5 percent, the European Union’s statistics
office in Luxembourg said today. The May figure was revised from
an initial estimate of a 0.3 percent decline. From a  year
earlier , June construction declined 3 percent.  “Although recent economic indicators suggest that the euro
zone may be emerging from recession, overall construction
activity  remains weak  and we expect challenging trading
conditions in Europe for the remainder of 2013,” Myles Lee,
chief executive officer of  CRH Plc (CRH) , said in a statement today.
Dublin-based building-materials producer CRH is the biggest
company on the benchmark Irish stock index.  While  gross domestic product  in the euro area rose 0.3
percent in the three months through June, ending six straight
quarters of contraction, the  unemployment rate  remains at a
record 12.1 percent.  Construction in Germany, Europe’s largest economy, expanded
1.6 percent in June after a 1.3 percent decrease in the previous
month. Output was unchanged in France and Spain, while the
Netherlands saw a 0.8 percent decline in the latest month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
