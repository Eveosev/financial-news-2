South Korea’s won fell the most in
three weeks on concern a reduction of U.S. stimulus will spur
outflows from emerging-market assets.  Government bonds  gained.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia  Dollar Index  dropped the most
in 10 weeks yesterday before the  Federal Open Market Committee 
releases minutes of its July meeting tomorrow. The Fed will
start tapering bond buying next month, according to 65 percent
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg from Aug. 9-13. Korean
exports rose 2.6 percent last month, while inflation has
remained below 2 percent since October, official data show.  “Asian currencies are weakening and volatility is rising
as investors are still trying to interpret the Fed’s exit
strategy,” said Cho Young Bok, a currency trader at Daegu Bank
in Seoul. “The won may hold better than other emerging
currencies based on South Korea’s fundamentals. Nonetheless, the
overall concern in Asian markets is affecting sentiment.”  The won fell 0.4 percent to 1,120.23 per dollar as of 10:04
a.m. in Seoul, the biggest decline since July 31, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, climbed 16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, to
7.51 percent.  Some $8.4 billion of exchange-traded funds were pulled from
 developing countries  and nearly $95 billion was pumped into ETFs
of U.S. shares this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The yield on the 2.75 percent bonds due June 2016 dropped
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.98 percent,
