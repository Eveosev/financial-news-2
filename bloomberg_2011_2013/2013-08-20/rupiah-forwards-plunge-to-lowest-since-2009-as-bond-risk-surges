Rupiah forwards slumped to a four-year low after  Indonesia ’s debt risk surged to the highest since
October 2011 on concern the Federal Reserve will taper stimulus
that has driven funds into emerging-market assets.  Five-year  credit-default swaps  insuring the Southeast Asian
nation’s debt against default has risen 56 basis points to 283
since the central bank kept its reference rate at 6.5 percent on
Aug. 15, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.
The Fed will start tapering its monthly bond purchases in
September, according to 65 percent of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg this month. The  Jakarta Composite (JCI)  index of shares has
erased this year’s gains.  “The rupiah will still be under selling pressure due to
global sentiment, along with local assets,” said Mika
Martumpal, head of treasury research and strategy at PT Bank
CIMB Niaga in Jakarta. “Risk indication surged following
disappointment over Bank Indonesia refraining from raising rates
to support the currency and attract inflows.”  The rupiah’s one-month non-deliverable forwards fell 2.3
percent, the biggest drop since June 20, to 11,094 per dollar as
of 9:54 a.m. in Jakarta, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The

settle the derivative contracts was set at 10,499 yesterday, the
lowest since June 2009. One-month implied volatility, a measure
of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
rose 101 basis points, or 1.01 percentage point, to 14.60
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg  The yield on the nation’s bonds due May 2023 was little
