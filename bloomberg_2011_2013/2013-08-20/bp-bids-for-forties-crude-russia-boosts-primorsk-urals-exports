BP Plc (BP/)  failed to buy North Sea
Forties crude at a higher level than yesterday. Royal Dutch
Shell Plc didn’t manage to sell Russian Urals at a lower price.  Russia will ship 15 cargoes of Urals from the Baltic port
of Primorsk from Aug. 31 to Sept. 10, two more than in similar
period this month, a preliminary loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News showed. Shipments are in lots of 100,000 tons.
OAO Rosneft issued a term tender for October to March.  North Sea  BP was looking to buy Forties for Sept. 13 to Sept. 15
loading at premium of 70 cents a barrel to Dated Brent,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window. The grade traded at plus
60 cents yesterday.  Trafigura Beheer BV failed to buy Forties at 60 cents above
Dated Brent for Sept. 10 to Sept. 15.  Vitol Group didn’t sell the crude at 80 cents above Dated
Brent for Sept. 9 to Sept. 11. Shell didn’t manage to sell
Forties for Sept. 3 to Sept. 5 at a premium of 85 cents, while
Gunvor offered the grade at 75 cents more than the benchmark for
Aug. 31 to Sept. 2 loading.  No bids or offers were made for Brent, Oseberg or Ekofisk
crudes. Reported crude trading typically occurs during the
Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time.  Brent for October settlement traded at $109.83 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $110.41 in the previous session. The November
contract was at $108.87, a discount of 96 cents to October.  All 15 September Ekofisk cargoes were deferred, according
to a revised schedule obtained by Bloomberg News. Three of the
consignments will now load in October, taking exports down to
240,000 barrels a day next month from 300,000 barrels in the
original schedule.  The delays are after a gas turbine fault at the BP Plc-operated Ula field on Aug. 7 preventing the platform from
handling output from the Tambar, Blane and Oselvar sites. The
three deposits, which are forecast to pump 8,000 barrels a day
of crude into the Ekofisk stream according to the Norwegian
Petroleum Directorate, won’t be able to resume production until
mid-September when the turbine at Ula is replaced.  Mediterranean/Urals  Shell failed to sell 100,000 metric tons of Urals at parity
to Dated Brent for loading in the Baltic Sea from Sept. 2 to
Sept. 6.  Eight Urals shipments will load from the port of Ust-Luga
in the first 10 days of September, while six Urals lots totaling
600,000 tons and one 80,000-ton cargo of Siberian Light will be
exported via Novorossiysk from Aug. 31 to Sept. 8.  Hellenic Petroleum SA issued a tender to buy 80,000 tons of
Urals for Sept. 10 to Sept. 12 delivery to  Greece , according to
three people with knowledge of the matter, asking not to be
identified because information is confidential. The tender
closes tomorrow.  Rosneft offered as much as 4.44 million tons of Urals for
loading from Novorossiysk in the Black Sea, according to two
traders with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be
identified because the information is confidential.  The company also offered as much as 7.2 million tons of the
sour grade from Primorsk and as much as 3.4 million tons from
Ust-Luga, both in the Baltic Sea. Rosneft offered as much as
5.22 million tons of CPC Blend from the Black Sea. The tender
closes Aug. 26, while bids are valid until Sept. 5.  Libya’s Zueitina port is ready to reopen, said Ibrahim Al
Awami, the director of inspection and measurement department of
the oil ministry. The Brega port reopened today. A force majeure
was declared on the two ports, as well as Es Sider and Ras Lanuf
on Aug. 18, which remain closed.  West Africa  Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd. is scheduled to award its
tender for October-loading crude tomorrow. Indian Oil’s tender
for the same period will be awarded on Aug. 22  Nigeria’s loading programs for October and official selling
prices for September are expected to be released this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
