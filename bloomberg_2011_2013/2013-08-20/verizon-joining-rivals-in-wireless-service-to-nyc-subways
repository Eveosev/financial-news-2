Verizon Wireless  agreed to bring
voice and data service to the New York City subway system,
becoming the last of the top four U.S. wireless carriers to
offer coverage in the stations.  Verizon says it expects to start installing third-generation and fourth-generation long-term evolution, or LTE,
equipment in the next several weeks. Service is expected to
begin in 36 Chelsea and midtown Manhattan stations this year,
according to a statement.  The addition of Verizon aids Transit Wireless LLC, a
closely held company installing antennas in subway stations, as
it pushes to cover all 277 stations in the largest U.S. subway
system by 2017. The $200 million project involves seven phases
of expansion, with phase two ending early next year in Queens
and in other parts of Manhattan.  Last month,  Sprint Corp. (S)   said  it had signed an agreement to
offer service in the subway, joining  AT&T Inc. (T)  and  T-Mobile US
Inc. (TMUS) , which entered a subway service agreement in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
