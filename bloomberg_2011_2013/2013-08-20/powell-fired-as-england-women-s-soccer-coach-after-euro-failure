Hope Powell was fired as coach of
the England women’s soccer squad after the team was knocked out
in the group stage of last month’s Euro 2013 tournament without
winning a game.  She led the senior squad for 15 years. The search for a
replacement will include domestic and international candidates,
the  Football Association  said today in a statement.  F.A. General Secretary Alex Horne said a change was
required so that the women’s team, which has enjoyed
“significant investment,” could compete with nations such as
Germany,  France , Japan, Brazil and the U.S. at the 2015  World
Cup .  Powell won 66 international caps as a player.  To contact the reporter on this story:
