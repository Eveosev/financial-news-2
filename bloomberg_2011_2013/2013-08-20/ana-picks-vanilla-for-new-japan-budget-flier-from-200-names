After spending a month and a half
sifting through 200 names for its new budget airline, Japan’s
 ANA Holdings Inc. (9202)  decided on the plainest one: Vanilla Air.  “Vanilla is loved by everyone in the world,” Tomonori
Ishii, president of the new airline based at Narita Airport,
Japan, told reporters in Tokyo today. “The smell of vanilla
makes people relaxed.”  ANA, Japan’s second-largest airline by sales, is rebranding
its low-cost carrier after a venture with Sepang, Malaysia-based
 AirAsia Bhd. (AIRA)  dissolved in June over disagreements on how to run
the company. ANA took over AirAsia Japan Co. and plans to start
operations before the end of the year, Ishii said.  The new airline and ANA hired “several” agencies to come
up with a list of brands, before a decision was made by Ishii
and ANA executives, said Kumiko Imai, a spokeswoman at AirAsia
Japan. She declined to provide the other name choices.  AirAsia Japan, which began operations in August, has five
domestic services. It also flies to Seoul and Busan in  South
Korea . The carrier planned to add flights to Taiwan next month
and was considering another overseas flight before the end of
March as it more than doubled its fleet to nine planes from
four.  Other low-cost carriers around the world include Mango
Airlines SOC Ltd. in  South Africa  and  SpiceJet Ltd. (SJET)  in India.
ANA also holds a 39 percent stake in another Japanese budget
airline called Peach Aviation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
