Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) ,  Australia ’s
second-biggest oil producer, will recommend using  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s floating liquefied natural gas technology to its
partners to develop the Browse project.  The selection of floating LNG requires the approval of the
Browse partners, including  BP Plc (BP/) , PetroChina Co. and Shell,
Perth-based Woodside said today in a statement.  “A compelling case has emerged for floating LNG as the
best option for early commercialization” of Browse, off the
West Australian coast, Chief Executive Officer  Peter Coleman 
said in the statement.  Woodside in April scrapped a plan to build Browse onshore
at an estimated cost of $45 billion, in favor of studying
cheaper options as costs in Australia rise. Floating LNG may be
almost 20 percent cheaper than building the Browse project on
land, Deutsche Bank AG said earlier this year.  Woodside last year sold a 14.7 percent stake in Browse to
 Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  and Mitsui & Co. for $2 billion.  BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s largest oil producer, agreed in December to
sell its stake in Browse to PetroChina Co. for $1.63 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
