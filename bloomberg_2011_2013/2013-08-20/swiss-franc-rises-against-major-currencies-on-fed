The Swiss franc climbed against all
of its 16 major peers as concern that the U.S. Federal Reserve
will start reducing bond purchases next month boosted demand for
 Switzerland ’s currency as a haven.  “The fear of an end of the ultra-easy money from the Fed
scared away investors,” Marco Birrfelder, an interest-rate
trader at  Luzerner Kantonalbank AG (LUKN)  in Lucerne, Switzerland,
wrote in a note to clients, commenting on the franc. “We can
probably expect new impetus only on Wednesday, when the minutes
of the U.S. central bank’s July meeting are published.”  The franc advanced 0.5 percent to 91.98 centimes against
the dollar at 11:46 a.m. in Zurich, after climbing as much as
0.7 percent, the biggest intraday move since Aug. 8. Against the
euro it traded at 1.2321.  Investors tend to buy the franc at times of heightened
anxiety. The  Swiss National Bank (SNBN)  set a cap of 1.20 per euro on
the franc in September 2011, after it nearly touched parity with
the euro amid the 17-member bloc’s debt crisis. The Zurich-based
central bank cited the risk of deflation and a recession as its
justification for the step.  Concern on the Fed’s next move also prompted a fall in
stocks to a six-week low, while oil led declines in commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
