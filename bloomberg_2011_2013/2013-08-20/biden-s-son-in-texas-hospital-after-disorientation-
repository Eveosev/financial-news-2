Beau Biden, the son of Vice
President  Joe Biden  and attorney general for the state of
 Delaware , was admitted to a Houston hospital after experiencing
“disorientation and weakness,” according to an e-mailed
statement from the vice president’s office.  The elder Biden, 70, accompanied his son to the hospital
and planned to remain in Houston with him tomorrow, according to
the statement. Beau Biden, 44, is being evaluated to determine
the cause of the episode that occurred while he was on vacation
last week.  The younger Biden was elected Delaware’s attorney general
in 2006. He has also served as a U.S. government prosecutor and
is an officer in the Army National Guard.  His father represented Delaware in the  U.S. Senate  for 36
years before becoming vice president in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
