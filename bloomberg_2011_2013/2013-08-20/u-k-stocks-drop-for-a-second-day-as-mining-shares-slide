U.K. stocks  dropped for a second
day, led by mining companies, as investors speculated that the
 Federal Reserve  will start reducing its bond-buying program as
early as next month.  Glencore Xstrata Plc retreated 3.4 percent after writing
down its assets by $7.7 billion. BHP Billiton Ltd. lost 3
percent as the world’s biggest commodity producer reported that
second-half profit fell. John Wood Group Plc tumbled 11 percent
after saying project delays and a weakening business in Canada
will affect full-year earnings at its engineering unit.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 (UKX)  declined 54.81 points, or 0.9
percent, to 6,410.92 at 9:03 a.m. in London. The gauge  has
slumped  6.3 percent since a high on May 22 after Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank could curb stimulus
measures if the U.S. economy strengthens in line with forecasts.
The broader FTSE All-Share Index slid 0.9 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index decreased 1.7 percent.  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100-listed
companies was 50 percent greater than the 30-day average, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The U.S. central bank publishes the minutes of last month’s
Federal Open Market Committee meeting tomorrow, enabling
investors to search policy makers’ deliberations for evidence of
when the Fed will start paring its $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases. The minutes from the July 30-31 meeting will probably
also provide details of the risks from allowing inflation to
fall below the central bank’s 2 percent target. The FOMC holds
its next two-day meeting on Sept. 17-18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
