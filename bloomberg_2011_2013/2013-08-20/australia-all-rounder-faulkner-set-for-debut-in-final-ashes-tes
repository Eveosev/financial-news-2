Australian all-rounder James
Faulkner was added to the team for the fifth and final Ashes
cricket Test against  England , replacing struggling batsman Usman
Khawaja.  Faulkner, 23, will make his Test debut when the match
starts tomorrow at the Oval in London. The Tasmania player has
appeared in eight one-day internationals and three Twenty20
matches for his country.  Khawaja averaged 19 in the three Tests in which he played
in the series. Fast bowler Jackson Bird was also dropped, making
way for Mitchell Starc, who played in two of the previous Tests.  Australia  is attempting to prevent a 4-0 series loss, an
unprecedented score line in Ashes played in England. The host
won the first two Tests, with the third ending in a draw, before
it took the fourth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
