Saudi Arabia , the biggest oil
producer, approved $105 million of water and sanitation works
across the kingdom, the state-owned  Saudi Press Agency  said,
citing Minister of Water and Electricity Abdullah Al-Hussayen.  The 22 projects include reservoirs, water-treatment plants
and pumping stations throughout the Arab world’s largest
economy, including in Hail and Mecca, SPA said. Saudi Arabia is
already the biggest desalinated water producer, serving a
population that’s quadrupled in 40 years and its  energy
industry .  In January, Al-Hussayen said $6.4 billion had been
allocated for water and sanitation projects in 2013. Saudi
Arabia spent $1.1 billion last year on 128 water and sewage
contracts just in the capital Riyadh. The ministry has 405 water
projects nationwide listed this year on its  official website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
