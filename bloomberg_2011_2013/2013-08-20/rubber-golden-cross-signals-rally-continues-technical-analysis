Rubber, which advanced 18 percent
from a nine-month low reached in June, may extend the rally as
moving averages formed a “golden cross,” according to
technical analysis by Fujitomi Co.  The 20-day moving average for futures on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange climbed above the 50-day measure this month,
signaling rubber gained upward momentum, said  Kazuhiko Saito ,
chief analyst at the Tokyo-based broker. The golden cross forms
as a short-term moving average rises above a long-term gauge.  “The market is getting better technically,” Saito said
yesterday. “It may still need some improvement in fundamentals,
such as a recovery in Chinese demand to end a bear trend.”  The commodity entered a  bear market  in April as imports by
China, the biggest user, fell 21 percent in the April-June
quarter from a year ago.  Another bullish signal is rubber’s advance after touching
the lowest since Sept. 7. in June, recouping more than half the
drop that it posted from the May high of 299 yen through the
June low of 223.9 yen, he said. The contract for delivery in
January was at 264.3 yen at 11:56 a.m. in Tokyo.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
