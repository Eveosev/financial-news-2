Steel reinforcement-bar futures
swung between gains and losses as investors weighed increasing
production at Chinese  steel mills  against prospects of stronger
demand.  Rebar for January delivery rose 0.3 percent to 3,824  yuan 
($624) a metric ton at 10:37 a.m. on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange, after advancing as high as 3,828 yuan and falling as
low as 3,801 yuan. The most-active contract reached a four-month
high at 3,848 yuan on Aug. 14.  Average daily crude steel output in  China  reached 2.14
million tons in the first 10 days of August, up 2.7 percent from
the last 10 days of July, Mysteel Research said on its website
today, citing data from the China Iron and Steel Association.
China will keep preferential tax policies for China Railway
Corp. and will strive to invest more than the original amount
planned for this year in the railroads, according to a statement
by the State Council yesterday.  “Investors are quite optimistic that demand will improve
in the second half of this year, but there’s concern that supply
is on the rise with mills raising production,” said Dang Man,
an analyst at Maike Futures Co. in Xi’an.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port gained 0.9
percent yesterday to $139.20 a dry ton, according to a  price
index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  The average  spot price  for rebar jumped 1.5 percent
yesterday to 3,620 yuan a ton, the highest since April,
according to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
