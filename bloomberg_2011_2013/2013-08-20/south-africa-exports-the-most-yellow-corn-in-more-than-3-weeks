South Africa , the continent’s
largest producer of corn, made its biggest shipment of the
yellow variety in more than three weeks.  The country exported 84,449 metric tons of yellow corn in
the week to Aug. 16, including 50,170 tons to  Japan  and 30,166
tons to  South Korea , the Pretoria-Based South African Grain
Information Service said in a statement on its website. That is
the largest shipment of the variety since the week through July
26, when South Africa exported 94,411 tons, the most in at least
a decade, according to the organization  The country may run out of yellow corn, used mainly as
 animal feed , if exports rise further, potentially lifting prices
for the white variety, which is used as a staple food, an
organization representing growers and traders said July 2.  “Exports remain robust; all that this implies is that
supply and demand will get tighter and tighter” Andrew Fletcher, an independent trader in Kroonstad in the Free State
province, said by phone.  Yellow corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract rose 0.1 percent to 2,195 rand ($216) a ton, the
highest since Aug. 2. The white variety for delivery in the same
period, was little changed at 2,343.20 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
