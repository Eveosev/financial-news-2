Japan ’s copper wire and cable
shipments increased 3.8 percent in July from a year earlier to
the highest level since November as demand from the construction
and electric-machinery industries gained, an industry group said.  Shipments totaled 61,800 metric tons last month, compared
with 59,533 tons a year earlier, the  Japanese Electric Wire &
Cable Makers’ Association  said today in a statement. Deliveries
were 54,087 tons in June, down 5.6 percent from a year earlier.  Japan’s overall exports jumped by the most since 2010 in
July, aiding Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s efforts to drive an
economic recovery even as rising energy costs boosted the trade
deficit. The stronger exports show Japan’s economy is benefiting
from a recovery in demand in  Europe  and the U.S., and the yen’s
11 percent decline against the dollar this year.  “The construction and electric-machinery industries led
the monthly number higher in July,” said Keiichi Ohki, an
official at the association’s research department. “Still, it’s
too early to say demand is picking up.”  Copper-cable shipments to the  construction industry  climbed
11.3 percent last month from a year earlier and 3.2 percent to
electric-machinery, while deliveries to automakers fell 4.8
percent, the association said.  Total deliveries fell 2.9 percent to 331,918 tons in the
first six months to June from the same period a year earlier,
the association said.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange was little changed at $7,316 a ton at 11:48 a.m. in
 Tokyo . The metal lost 7.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
