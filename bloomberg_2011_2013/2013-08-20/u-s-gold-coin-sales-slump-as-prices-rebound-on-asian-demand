Sales of U.S. Mint American Eagle
gold-coins, which have slowed since prices entered a  bear market 
in April, are down 87 percent this month from August last year.  The mint sold 3,000 ounces of the coins so far this month,
down from 209,500 ounces in April, its website shows. August
sales may total about 5,077 ounces at the current pace,
according to Bloomberg calculations, compared with 39,000 ounces
in August last year.  Gold slid 19 percent this year through yesterday as some
investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value and on
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will slow stimulus that helped
the metal rally for 12 years. Bullion has rebounded 16 percent
from a 34-month low on June 28 as lower prices spurred physical
purchases from  China  to Turkey.  “People in  Asia  have clearly taken advantage of the lower
gold price in recent months and bought huge amounts,”  Daniel Briesemann , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said
today by telephone. “Some quite encouraging economic data of
late out of the U.S.” may be slowing American coin demand.  Gold-coin purchases totaled 682,500 ounces this year,
compared with 753,000 ounces in all of 2012, the Mint said.
Sales of American Eagle silver coins were 31.9 million ounces
so far this year, compared with 33.7 million in 2012, according
to data on the website. The mint, which said in April that it
ran out of its smallest gold items, said in June that sales of
gold and silver coin may climb to a record this year.  American Eagle gold-coin sales were valued at $1.26 billion
last year, based on an all-time high average gold price.  Asia Demand  “The demand for silver has remained very strong,” said
Michael Haynes, the chief executive officer of American Precious
Metals Exchange, an online bullion dealer, said in a telephone
interview. “I am very bullish on silver.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.6 percent to
$1,374.20 an ounce at 10:56 a.m. on the Comex in  New York , and
silver futures for December delivery climbed less than 0.1
percent to $23.225 an ounce. The white metal jumped 15 percent
last week, the most since 2008.  Gold bar and coin purchases reached a record last quarter
and jewelry usage rose to the most since 2008, World Gold
Council figures showed last week.  Demand in  India  and labor concerns in  South Africa  may
boost prices in the next four to five weeks, JPMorgan Chase &
Co. said in a report dated Aug. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
