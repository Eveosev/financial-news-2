Precise Biometrics AB (PREC) , a Swedish
maker of fingerprint log-in technology, rose to its highest in
almost two months in Stockholm trading after signing a contract
with sensor provider  Fingerprint Cards AB. (FINGB)   The  shares  jumped as much as 18 percent to 3.14 kronor, the
highest intraday price since June 24, and rose 15 percent to
3.06 kronor at 10:37 a.m. local time. The stock has more than
quadrupled this year, valuing the Lund, Sweden-based company at
992 million kronor ($151 million). Trading volume was more than
twice the three-month daily average.  Biometric-company stocks have jumped in the past year on
expectations  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  will unveil a new iPhone next month that
includes a fingerprint reader, a prediction bolstered by Apple’s
$350 million purchase of fingerprint-sensor maker AuthenTec Inc.
last year. Competitors to the Cupertino, California-based
company are looking for alternatives to match the maker of
iPhones, Precise Biometrics’s Chief Executive Officer Thomas Marschall has said.  Precise Biometrics’s fingerprint software will be included
in Fingerprint Cards’s sensor products, targeting smartphones
and tablets, the company said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
