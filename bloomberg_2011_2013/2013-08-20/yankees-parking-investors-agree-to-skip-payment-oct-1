Investors holding $237.6 million of
tax-exempt bonds that financed parking garages at Yankee Stadium
agreed to extend a forbearance accord and forgo an $8.1 million
payment due Oct. 1, a securities filing shows.  Bondholders stretched the reprieve for Bronx Parking
Development Co. through Oct. 15 and won’t sue for early
redemption of the defaulted debt, according to the filing with
the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.  Occupancy of the company’s garages and lots, with about
8,700 public spaces, has suffered as fans take trains, buses and
taxis to Major League Baseball games and drivers balk at paying
$35 to park for an event. In April, 45,475 cars used the
facilities, a 33 percent occupancy rate, according to  filings .  Last month, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service said it was
examining the bonds to check compliance with requirements for
tax exemptions. Bronx Parking missed a $6.9 million interest
payment on April 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
