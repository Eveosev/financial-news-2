Iraq , home to the world’s fifth-largest proven oil reserves, generated 6.9 percent more from
crude sales in July, compared with the previous month, according
to the Oil Ministry.  The Middle East nation earned $7.27 billion from the export
of 2.32 million barrels a day of crude in July,  Asim Jihad , a
ministry spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. Iraq
generated $6.8 billion from the shipment of 2.33 million barrels
a day in June.  OPEC’s second-largest producer after  Saudi Arabia  exported
66.4 million barrels last month from the southern terminal of
Basra and 5.6 million barrels from the northern oil hub of
Kirkuk at an average price of $101 a barrel, he said. That
compares with $97.41 in June.  The Iraqi government deployed an additional 2,500 soldiers
to protect the pipeline running from Kirkuk to Turkey’s port of
Ceyhan on the Mediterranean, according to the spokesman. That
link has been attacked 38 times this year, compared with six in
2012.  Iraq plans to increase crude exports from September as the
Gharraf and Majnoon oil fields start production, Jihad said in
an Aug. 16 interview. Gharraf, developed by Malaysia’s Petroliam
Nasional Bhd and  Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. (1662) , is scheduled
to start producing 35,000 barrels a day this month and Majnoon,
developed by  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and Petroliam Nasional, is to
begin output by October, Oil Minister Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi
said in an Aug. 13 statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
