Hong Kong  stocks  fell, with the
city’s benchmark index heading for the longest losing streak in
two months, as raw-material producers slid after metal prices
dropped and China Everbright Ltd. declined as its brokerage unit
slumped upon resuming trading in China.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  lost 0.2 percent to 22,429.72 as of
9:38 a.m. in Hong Kong, about two shares falling for each that
rose on the 50-member gauge. The Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index, also known as the H-share index, dropped 0.1 percent to
10,188.06.  The Hang Seng Index retreated 0.9 percent this year through
yesterday, the only decline among developed markets tracked by
Bloomberg. The gauge traded at 10.72 times estimated earnings
yesterday, compared with 14.93 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  The  H-share index  fell 17 percent from a Feb. 1 high
through yesterday. The index traded at 1.23 times book value,
compared with a five-year average of 1.78.  Materials and energy companies led declines this year on
the Hang Seng Composite Index amid concern weaker expansion in
 China  will sap demand. Information-technology and utility shares
were the biggest gainers.  Futures on the S&P 500 added 0.2 percent today. The gauge
capped its first four-day decline in New York yesterday as
falling crude prices dragged on energy shares and Treasury
yields jumped to a two-year high as investors awaited signals on
the Federal Reserve’s stimulus plans.  The Federal Open Market Committee will release minutes of
its July 30-31 meeting tomorrow, with investors seeking clues on
when the central bank will pare $85 billion in monthly asset
purchases. Officials will begin to curtail bond buying at their
Sept. 17-18 meeting, according to 65 percent of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg from Aug. 9-13. Global central bankers
meet in Jackson Hole,  Wyoming , on Aug. 22-24 to discuss the
world economy and monetary policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
