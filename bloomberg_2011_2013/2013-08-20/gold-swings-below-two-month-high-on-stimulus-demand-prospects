Gold gained for the fourth time in
five sessions as a weaker dollar increased demand for the
precious metal as an alternative investment.  The Bloomberg  Dollar Index , a gauge against 10 major
currencies, fell as much as 0.4 percent, declining for the first
time in three sessions. The greenback’s rally this year, up 3.7
percent through yesterday, contributed to a 19 percent drop in
gold. The  Federal Reserve ’s Federal Open Market Committee
meeting minutes are due tomorrow, when investors will look for
clues on when it will reduce stimulus.  “The dollar is supporting the gold market,” Phil Streible, a senior commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien & Associates
in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “People will be
looking for a clear indication from the Fed tomorrow.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.5 percent to
$1,372.60 an ounce at 1:42 p.m. on the Comex in  New York , after
dropping as much as 1 percent. Prices jumped 4.5 percent last
week, the most since July 12.  Gold is headed for the worst annual drop since 1997 as some
investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value. The Fed
will probably begin to reduce the $85 billion of monthly debt
buying in September, according to 65 percent of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg from Aug. 9 to Aug. 13.  The precious metal jumped 70 percent from the end of
December 2008 to June 2011 as the Fed bought more than $2
trillion in bonds to bolster the economy.  Silver Slides  Silver futures for December delivery slid 0.4 percent to
$23.118 an ounce on the Comex, after yesterday reaching a three-month high of $23.64. The metal’s 14-day relative-strength index
was above for a fourth straight session, indicating to some
investors who study technical charts that a decline may be
imminent.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery gained 1.1 percent to $1,525.50 an ounce.
Palladium futures for September delivery slumped 0.4 percent to
$749.65 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
