Synagro Technologies Inc., the
largest biosolids and organic residuals recycler in the U.S.,
won approval of its restructuring plan, completing a $480
million sale to private-equity firm EQT Infrastructure II LP.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Linehan Shannon, at a hearing
today in Wilmington,  Delaware , granted approval of a
reorganization plan that includes the deal with Stockholm-based
EQT, which provides about $465 million in cash to distribute to
creditors.  “The plan was widely accepted” by almost all creditors
George N. Panagakis, a lawyer for the company, told Shannon.  Shannon agreed the case had been resolved on a “largely
consensual basis.”  The plan is expected to be effective on Aug. 22.  Carlyle Group LP (CG) , the world’s second-biggest private-equity
firm by assets, acquired Synagro in 2007 for $462 million plus
the assumption of $310 million in debt.  Synagro, based in Houston, filed for  bankruptcy protection 
in April, following several renewable-energy companies into
court protection as they struggled to turn environmentally
friendly energy initiatives into profits.  Synagro serves more than 600 municipal and industrial water
and wastewater facilities, it said in a statement. The company
processes waste to produce products including fertilizer and
fuels. The company was founded in 1986, and has 800 employees in
34 states from  Connecticut  to  California , according to its
website.  Restructuring Plan  Under the restructuring plan, lenders owed about
$316 million will be repaid in full, as will unsecured trade
creditors owed as much as $16.9 million.  Other lenders with a secondary priority of repayment will
have at least $45 million in allowed secured claims, according
to the disclosure statement, an outline of the plan. The lenders
are projected to recoup about 88 cents to 90 cents on the dollar
on those claims. They are projected to recover at most 1.2
percent of the remaining $57.4 million to $60.4 million in
unsecured deficiency claims, according to court papers.  General unsecured creditors, owed from $500,000 to
potentially $20 million, are projected to recover as much as
10 percent if the claims fall at the low-end and less than
1 percent if at the high-end, court filings show.  The case is In re In re Synagro Technologies Inc., 13-11041,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
