CRH Plc (CRH) , the biggest company on the
benchmark Irish stock index, fell the most in Dublin in four
months after it pared second-half earnings guidance on Europe’s
struggling economy.  The shares fell as much 5.8 percent to 15.8 euros, the
biggest fall since April 5, after the building materials company
said it expects second-half earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization to be in line with last year. In
May, the company said it expected the earnings gauge to be ahead
of last year’s figure.  “This is a disappointing set of results particularly on
the back of reduced guidance,” said David Holohan, an analyst
at Merrion Capital in Dublin, who has a sell recommendation on
the stock. “CRH continues to be the most expensive name in the
heavy side space in  Europe , a position we do not view as
justified given the group’s lack of growth prospects relative to
peers.”  Europe is experiencing a weak recovery so far, the
company’s Chief Executive Officer Myles Lee said in an interview
on Bloomberg TV’s Countdown show. Pricing in the region remains
tough, Lee said, though he was hopeful of an improvement next
year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
