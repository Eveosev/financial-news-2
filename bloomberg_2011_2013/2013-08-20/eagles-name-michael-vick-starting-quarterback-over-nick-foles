Michael Vick  won the starting
quarterback job for the  Philadelphia Eagles  over  Nick Foles , the
team said on its website.  Vick, 33, completed 13 of 15 passes for 199 yards and a
touchdown in two preseason games.  Coach Chip Kelly told reporters today that Vick will now
get the majority of snaps at practice and described the team as
a one-quarterback operation, according to a report on
Philly.com.  Vick, a four-time Pro Bowl player and former No. 1 pick in
the NFL draft by the  Atlanta Falcons , started 10 games in 2012,
suffering a concussion in November. He completed 58.1 percent of
his passes for 2,362 yards and threw for 12 touchdowns and had
10 interceptions.  Philadelphia finished the season 4-12 and fired coach  Andy Reid . Kelly wouldnâ€™t commit to Vick in the offseason, setting up
a training camp battle between the second-year Foles and the 12-year veteran.  Foles completed 11-of-14 passes for 96 yards and an
interception during the preseason.  The Eagles open the  season  on the road Sept. 9 against the
Washington Redskins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
