Ichiro Suzuki moved within one hit
of 4,000 for his career as the  New York  Yankees swept both games
of a day-night doubleheader from the  Toronto Blue Jays .  Suzuki, 39, had a single and a double in five at-bats at
Yankee Stadium yesterday and has 3,999 career hits combined in
Japan and Major League Baseball.  Pete Rose  (4,256) and Ty Cobb
(4,189) are the only professional players with 4,000 hits.  Suzuki had 1,278 hits in Japan and has 2,721 hits during 13
MLB seasons with the Seattle Mariners and Yankees.  The Yankees won the first game 8-4.  Robinson Cano  hit a
three-run homer in the third inning, his 200th career home run,
and Chris Stewart added a three-run shot in the sixth as the
Yankees rallied from an early 4-0 deficit. Cano added a run-scoring double in the seventh.  In the night game, Jayson Nix hit a solo homer in the
seventh inning to tie the game and then gave the Yankees a 3-2
win with a run-scoring single in the ninth. His single drove in
Suzuki, who did not get an at-bat in the game.  Suzuki entered the night game as a pinch-runner in the
ninth, moved to second on a sacrifice, stole third and then
scored the winning run.  The Yankees, who have won eight of their past 10 games, are
66-59 and in fourth place in the American League East division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
