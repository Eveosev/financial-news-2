Brazil ’s swap rates declined from a
19-month high and the real advanced after central bank president
Alexandre Tombini said yesterday that traders’ projections for
increases in borrowing costs were excessive.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 dropped 28
basis points, or 0.28 percentage point, to 10.38 percent at 9:44
a.m. in Sao Paulo after rising yesterday to 10.66 percent, the
highest level since January 2012. The real appreciated 1 percent
to 2.3883 per dollar after closing yesterday at a level weaker
than 2.4 for the first time since March 2009.  Traders projected yesterday the possibility that the
central bank will step up the pace of borrowing-cost increases
to 75 basis points at its monetary policy meeting this month and
lift the target lending rate beyond 10 percent by year-end. Swap
rates have risen too far, Tombini said in a statement on the
central bank’s website yesterday.  “Tombini was forceful,” Daniel Cunha, the chief economist
at XP Investimentos, said by phone from  Sao Paulo . “He made it
very clear that the central bank is not discussing a change in
the pace of interest-rate increases.”  The central bank raised the target rate by a half-percentage point on July 10 to 8.50 percent, bringing it up 1.25
percentage points from a record low 7.25 percent in April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
