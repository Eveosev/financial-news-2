to a record seasonal low against futures after  Tesoro Corp. (TSO) ’s
Southern  California  refinery finished unscheduled work and
supplies of the fuel hovered above the five-year average.  Tesoro’s 363,000-barrel-a-day Los Angeles refinery was
running normally yesterday following unscheduled repairs on a

at the company’s headquarters in  San Antonio , said by e-mail
late yesterday.  Stockpiles of California-blend gasoline jumped 3.4 percent

scheduled to release last week’s supplies tomorrow.  The discount for Carbob in Los Angeles widened 1.75 cents

compiled by Bloomberg at 3:46 p.m. New York time. Prompt
