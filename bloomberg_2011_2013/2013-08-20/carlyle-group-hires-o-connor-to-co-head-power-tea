  Carlyle Group LP (CG) , the world’s
second-largest manager of alternative assets such as private-equity, hired a GE Capital executive to co-head an energy team.  Matthew O’Connor, 43, joins as a managing director on the
power-investing team, the Washington-based company said in a
statement today. O’Connor and Bob Mancini will co-manage the
team, which is investing with Cogentrix Energy power group.  “We see remarkable opportunity in the electric power
generation space in North America,” from mergers and
acquisitions and development, Mancini said in the statement.
O’Connor will “help lead the execution of our strategy,”
Mancini said.  O’Connor spent 14 years at GE Capital, the investment arm
of  General Electric Co. (GE) , where he was most recently executive
vice president, financing operations of GE Capital Aviation
Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
