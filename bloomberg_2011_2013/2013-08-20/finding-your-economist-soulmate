The activity of the day among economics bloggers is this  site , which allows you to answer questions about the economy, and then tells you what economist you are most similar to (based on their responses to IGM’s surveys on economic issues). It turns out that I am most similar to is Anil Kashyap of the University of Chicago, which is not entirely surprising, because I’m a big fan of Kashyap’s work on things like  Japan’s 20-year “Lost Decade” .  Here’s the abstract of Kashyap’s  most recent paper :  And here’s why I like Kashyap’s work: like most people, I would have easily and quickly identified the problem with having companies pay for their own ratings. But I wouldn’t have instantly thought of the problems with alternative possible systems. If our judgments on recent economic issues are similar, I’m in good company.
