Boston  Red Sox pitcher Ryan Dempster
was suspended for five games by Major League Baseball for
hitting New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez with a
pitch two days ago.  Yankees manager Joe Girardi was fined an undisclosed amount
for arguing with the home-plate umpire after Rodriguez was hit,
MLB said in a statement. Dempster also was fined an undisclosed
amount “for intentionally throwing at and hitting” Rodriguez,
according to the statement.  Dempster threw three inside pitches before hitting
Rodriguez in the left side with a fastball during his first at-bat in New York’s 9-6 win over Boston.  Rodriguez, who is playing while appealing a 211-game drug
suspension, later hit a solo home run in the sixth inning off
Dempster as the Yankees went on to win the finale of a three-game series at Boston’s Fenway Park.  After Rodriguez, 38, was hit, the home plate umpire issued
warnings to both teams. Girardi was ejected from the game after
a heated argument and later said Dempster should have been
thrown out of the game because he intentionally hit Rodriguez.
Several Boston players had said previously that Rodriguez
shouldn’t be playing.  Rodriguez returned to the Yankees’ lineup on Aug. 5 after
missing 110 games while rehabilitating from offseason hip
surgery and then what was diagnosed by the Yankees’ doctor as a
mild quadriceps strain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
