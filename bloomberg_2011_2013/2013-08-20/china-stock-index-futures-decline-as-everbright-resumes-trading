Chinese stocks  fell as commodity
producers declined and Everbright Securities Co. plunged by the
10 percent daily limit. Railway companies advanced.  Everbright Securities’ shares traded for the first time
since erroneous buy orders roiled the nation’s equities last
week. Jiangxi Copper Co. the nation’s largest producer of the
metal, slid 2.8 percent to a three-week low and PetroChina Co.
lost 1.1 percent as metal and oil prices declined. Daqin Railway
Co. and Guangshen Railway Co. rose more than 1.6 percent after
the government said it plans to boost spending on railroads.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 0.6 percent to 2,072.59
at the close. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slumped 3.4
percent in  Hong Kong , heading for its biggest loss in 18 months.
Shares dropped across Asia amid concern a reduction of stimulus
by the U.S.  Federal Reserve  will spur outflows from the region.  “It’s not the end of the saga for Everbright yet,” said
said  Zhang Gang , a strategist at Central China Securities
Holdings Co. in Shanghai. “Confidence is low.”  The CSI 300 Index lost 0.8 percent to 2,312.47, while the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index sank 1.8 percent. The Federal Reserve,
which will publish minutes of its July meeting tomorrow, will
probably start reducing bond purchases in September, according
to 65 percent of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The Shanghai Composite has tumbled about 40 percent from
its August 2009 high, erasing about $644 billion in market
value, as the world’s second-largest economy slowed and local
investors emptied more than 2 million equity trading accounts.  Everbright Securities dropped to 10.91 yuan. The China
Securities Regulatory Commission banned the state-controlled
brokerage from proprietary trading for three months after 23.4
billion  yuan  ($3.8 billion) of erroneous buy orders on Aug. 16.
Everbright also said yesterday it mispriced 10 million yuan of
 government bonds .  Trading System  Haitong Securities Co. (600837)  slumped 3.3 percent to 10.63 yuan.
The brokerage is looking into media reports of a trading system
problem, Board Secretary Jin Xiaobin said by phone. Some Haitong
clients weren’t able to sell shares of Sinopec Shanghai
Petrochemical Co. and Sinopec Yizheng Chemical Fibre Co. this
morning when the two firms resumed trading after restructuring,
China.com.cn reported.  A gauge tracking material producers lost 1.8 percent, the
most among the 10 industry groups. Jiangxi Copper fell to 16.75

Central Television  yesterday the government will increase
financial support to the economy, while the main economic
indicators are within an expected range. Premier  Li Keqiang  said
