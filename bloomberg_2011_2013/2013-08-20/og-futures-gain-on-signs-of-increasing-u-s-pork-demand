Hog futures climbed for the first
time in four sessions on speculation that demand for U.S. pork
is rising. Cattle prices fell.  About 378,000 hogs were processed in the  Iowa  and southern
Minnesota region in the week ending Aug. 10, up 0.5 percent from
a week earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Spot
hog  prices  have climbed 11 percent in the past year, and
wholesale  pork  gained 12 percent, according to government
figures.  “Summer demand on hogs has been very, very good,”
Lawrence Kane, a senior market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group
in Yates City,  Illinois , said in a telephone interview. “We saw
stronger hog prices than expected.”  Hog futures for October settlement rose 0.5 percent to 86.9
cents a pound at 9:46 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
The price fell 1.9 percent in the previous three sessions.  Cattle futures for October delivery dropped 0.1 percent to
$1.28 a pound.  Feeder-cattle futures for September settlement advanced 0.1
percent to $1.581 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
