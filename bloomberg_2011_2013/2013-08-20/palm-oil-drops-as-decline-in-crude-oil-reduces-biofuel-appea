Palm oil  retreated from a five-week
high as investors sold commodities including crude oil, reducing
the appeal of vegetable oils as biofuel feedstock.  The contract for November delivery declined 0.2 percent to
close at 2,329 ringgit ($708) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives. Futures yesterday closed at the highest price for
the most-active contract since July 11. Palm for physical
delivery in September was at 2,400 ringgit, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Commodities from soybeans to crude fell with stocks and
emerging-market currencies on speculation that a U.S. recovery
will prompt the Federal Reserve to pare its quantitative-easing
program. West Texas Intermediate oil for September delivery
dropped 0.4 percent to $106.63 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . A record 5.6 million tons of palm was used
for fuel in 2012, according to Hamburg-based research company
Oil World.  “The expectation of the tapering of QE may have shifted
asset allocation back to safe-haven assets,” Alan Lim Seong Chun, an analyst at Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd., said in Kuala
Lumpur. “We are seeing some weakening of crude  oil prices ,
which will then translate into lower demand for biofuels.”  Soybean oil  for delivery in December fell 1.2 percent to
43.26 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
November lost 1.4 percent to $12.8525 a bushel, after gaining
3.5 percent yesterday.  Malaysian Exports  Palm oil exports from  Malaysia , the world’s second-largest
producer, climbed 10 percent to 880,979 tons in the first 20
days of this month from the same period in July, surveyor
Intertek said today. Shipments gained 12 percent in the same
period, according to SGS (Malaysia) Sdn.  A decline in India’s currency to an all-time low may fail
to deter refiners and traders from importing a record amount of
cooking oils this year as the commodity is seen as an essential,
according to the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India. The
rupee tumbled past 64 per dollar today for the first time.  Refined palm oil for January delivery declined 1.7 percent
to close at 5,540  yuan  ($905) a ton on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange. Soybean oil lost 1.4 percent to 7,134 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
