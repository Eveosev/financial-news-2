Detroit ’s bankruptcy mediator
appointed a team of current and former judges to help him settle
disputes between the insolvent city and creditors as the parties
try to negotiate cuts in about $18 billion of debt.  U.S. District Judge Gerald Rosen in Detroit added federal
judges from Michigan,  Oregon , Colorado and Illinois, he said
today in a statement.  Three of the five new mediators are current or former
judges who were appointed by former U.S. President  Bill Clinton :
Victoria Roberts is a federal judge who serves with Rosen on the
bench in Detroit; David Coar is a former federal bankruptcy and
district court judge from Illinois; Wiley Daniel is a senior
federal judge from Colorado.  Rosen also named U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Elizabeth Perris of
Oregon. Perris has been a court-appointed mediator for three
California cities that also filed bankruptcy, Vallejo, Mammoth
Lakes and Stockton. Stockton remains in bankruptcy.  The fifth new mediator is Eugene Driker, co-founder of the
Detroit law firm Barris, Sott, Denn & Driker and a native of the
city.  Detroit filed bankruptcy last month, saying it couldn’t
afford to pay its debts after decades of economic decline had
devastated the city’s finances. Public employee unions and
pension funds have challenged the city’s proposals to cut their
retirement benefits.  The case is City of Detroit, 13-bk-53846,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit).  To contact the reporter on this story:
