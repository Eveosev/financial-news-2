SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., the
investment banking unit of  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) ,
hired top-ranked Japanese auto parts analyst Kunihiro Matsumoto
from  UBS AG. (UBSN)   SMBC Nikko hired Matsumoto as a senior analyst in late
July, Tadataka Ishida, a Tokyo-based spokesman for the
brokerage, said in a phone interview today. Matsumoto was rated
the  No. 1  auto parts analyst in Japan this year by Institutional
Investor magazine and a Nikkei Veritas newspaper poll.  Sumitomo Mitsui, Japan’s second-largest bank by market
value, is expanding its equity business, seeking more fees and
commissions as loan profitability at the nation’s banks remains
the lowest in  Asia . The brokerage also hired Hiroaki Funo as an
auto parts analyst from UBS last month, Ishida said.  The Tokyo-based bank boosted fee and commission income 31
percent to 250.3 billion yen ($2.6 billion) in the quarter ended
June 30 from a year earlier,  Sumitomo Mitsui  said last month.
SMBC Nikko contributed to the gain, posting a more than sixfold
profit increase as Japanese stock-trading volume surged. Revenue
at the unit climbed 82 percent to 110.5 billion yen in the
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
