South Korea, the world’s  second-largest buyer  of liquefied natural gas, is scheduled to receive
a spot cargo from West Africa, ship-tracking data show.  The LNG Adamawa, with a capacity of about 143,000 cubic
meters, is set to arrive tomorrow, according to transmissions
captured by IHS Fairplay on Bloomberg. The data don’t show where
the cargo was loaded or its destination port.  Asian LNG buyers typically import more spot cargoes from
June to August as power consumption increases during the warmest
months. South Korea doesn’t have long-term contracts with West
Africa’s LNG producers such as Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea and
 Angola , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  South Korea urged consumers to conserve power as some of
the nuclear reactors that supplied 30 percent of the nation’s
generating capacity last year were shut for safety checks. The
country issued a preliminary alert for a possible electricity
shortage Aug. 12., Korea Power Exchange said on its website.  Record temperatures across North Asia have killed dozens of
people and pushed electricity grids to near breaking point,
forcing governments to introduce emergency measures as more of
the same heat is forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
