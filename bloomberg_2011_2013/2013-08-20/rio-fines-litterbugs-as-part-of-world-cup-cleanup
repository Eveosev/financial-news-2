Authorities in Rio de Janeiro began
punishing litterbugs with fines of as much as 3,000 reais
($1,250) in the latest bid to clean up the beach-side city ahead
of next year’s soccer World Cup.  As part of what’s been dubbed operation “ Zero Trash ,” a
team of 600 city workers and police officers armed with portable
electronic devices are being deployed to enforce a decade-old
law against littering. Fines range from 157 reais for tossing
away items the size of a beer can to as much as 3,000 reais --
more than four times the monthly minimum wage -- for those
caught illegally dumping debris and other large items.  In downtown Rio this morning, at least 42 people were
fined, O Globo newspaper reported. Those who decline to show ID
cards face arrest.  The cleanup follows efforts by Mayor Eduardo Paes to bring
order to the city of 6.3 million, which is also hosting the 2016
Summer Olympics. As part of the mayor’s so-called shock and
order initiative, authorities in recent years have cracked down
on everything from operators of illegal transport vans and
street vendors to the sale of grilled shrimp and soccer playing
on the city’s beaches.  While Rio’s natural landscapes and annual Carnival
celebration are major tourist draws, city residents called
cariocas have been known to neglect to care for their hometown,
a UNESCO World Heritage site. The city was ranked 31st for
cleanliness out of 40 tourist destinations around the world in a
survey of travelers carried out last year by the TripAdvisor
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
