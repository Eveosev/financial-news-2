Perry Capital LLC, which sided with
activist investor  Bill Ackman  in his effort to remove J.C.
Penney Co.’s chief executive officer, has taken a stake in
 Herbalife Ltd. (HLF)  in opposition to Ackman, said a person with
knowledge of the purchases.  The person, who asked not to be identified because the
position hasn’t been publicly disclosed, said Perry’s stake was
less than 5 percent and didn’t say when it was acquired. The
shares climbed 3.9 percent to $64.72 today at the close in New
York, after CNBC reported the purchase. The company’s stock has
almost doubled this year.  Ackman has sold Herbalife shares short, seeking to profit
from their decline, and said the Cayman Islands-based company is
an illegal pyramid scheme that should be shut down. Herbalife
has repeatedly denied the allegations.  Richard Perry , founder of
Perry Capital, joins hedge fund managers  Carl Icahn  and  George Soros  in betting against Ackman.  Icahn, Herbalife’s largest individual investor, owns a 16
percent stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Perry
Capital didn’t own any Herbalife shares as of June 30, according
to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.  Perry reported a 7.3 percent stake in J.C. Penney on Aug. 9
and echoed Ackman’s comments that the board should quickly seek
to overhaul its management, including naming a replacement for
CEO Mike Ullman.  To contact the reporters on this story:
