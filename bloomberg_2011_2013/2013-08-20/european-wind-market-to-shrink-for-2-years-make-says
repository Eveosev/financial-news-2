The wind-turbine market in Europe,
the Middle East and  Africa  will shrink this year and next after
economic growth slowed and governments scaled back subsidies,
 Make Consulting  said.  The region is set to install 13.3 gigawatts of turbines
this year and 12.4 gigawatts next year, down from 13.4 gigawatts
in 2012, Make said today in an e-mailed statement. The global
market is forecast to contract by about 5 percent this year
before rebounding in 2014 with 20 percent growth, it said.  Governments in some of Europe’s biggest wind-power markets
have reined in support for renewables in recent years as
economies stagnated. Spain halted assistance for new wind
projects and the U.K. reduced subsidies, while German Chancellor
Angela Merkel is urging reform of the grant system and slowing
an expansion of onshore wind to keep costs in check.  “Policy uncertainty in recent months has put a dampener on
demand,” Aarhus, Denmark-based Make said in the statement. “As
a result, market contraction in the EMEA region is likely to
deepen further in 2014.”  Make expects the regional market to rebound later in the
decade, reaching 19 gigawatts of installations in 2020. It
predicts South Africa,  Finland , Russia,  Ukraine ,  Norway , Egypt
and  Morocco  will add a total of 18 gigawatts by then. It also
forecasts that most onshore wind power in the region will reach
grid-parity by 2020, meaning it’s able to compete subsidy-free
with traditional generators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
