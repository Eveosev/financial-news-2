Cocoa rose to the highest in more
than eight months in New York after official data released by
Ivory Coast showed bean deliveries in the world’s biggest
producer were lower than forecast. Coffee declined.  Cocoa deliveries to Ivorian ports from farms amounted to
1.28 million metric tons from Oct. 1 to June 30, up from 1.26
million tons a year earlier, according to the country’s
ministries of finance and agriculture. Bean arrivals for the
period were estimated on July 2 at 1.34 million tons by
KnowledgeCharts, a unit of Commodities Risk Analysis in
Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania .  “The arrivals figures released by Ivory Coast’s finance
ministry yesterday were lower than the market expected and this
is even more supportive of the market,” Jerome Jourquin, the
head of agriculture derivatives at brokerage Aurel BGC in Paris,
said by e-mail today. “Traders have a 1,748 pounds ($2,739) a
ton target in mind now.”  Cocoa for delivery in December gained 0.6 percent to $2,527
a ton by 6 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The price
touched $2,530 a ton, the highest since Dec. 3. Cocoa for the
same delivery month climbed 0.4 percent to 1,665 pounds a ton on
NYSE Liffe in London.  Money managers’ bullish bets on London cocoa reached a 10-month high. The net-long position, or bets on higher prices,
totaled 49,567 futures and options as of Aug. 13, NYSE Liffe
data showed yesterday. That’s the highest since Sept. 25 and
compares with 46,601 contracts a week earlier.  Lindt & Spruengli AG (LISP) , the world’s largest maker of premium
chocolate, said its first-half net income surged 40 percent to
48.8 million Swiss francs ($53 million), exceeding the 44.3
million-franc average of five analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Chocolate Consumption  “The global economy reported a slight improvement which
had a positive impact on consumer sentiment in many countries,”
Lindt, based in Kilchberg, Switzerland, said in an earnings
statement today. “The cool and rainy weather experienced in
many places in the first half also had a favorable impact on
chocolate consumption.”  Raw sugar for delivery in October was unchanged at 16.53
cents a pound in New York. Refined, or white, sugar for the same
delivery month retreated 0.5 percent to $489.20 a ton in  London .  Arabica coffee for delivery in December fell 0.7 percent to
$1.2195 a pound on ICE. Robusta coffee for delivery in November
slid 0.7 percent to $1,863 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporters on this story:
