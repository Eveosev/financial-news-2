More than half of U.S.
undergraduates receive federal financial aid, demonstrating
their increasing reliance on taxpayers as college costs
escalate, federal data show.  Fifty-seven percent obtained grants, loans and other
benefits in 2011-2012, up from 47 percent in 2007-2008, the last
time the government tallied those figures, according to a U.S.
Education Department  report  today. It marks the first time a
majority of students relied on U.S. aid since the agency started
tracking the data in 1987.  The government released the data before President  Barack Obama  this week is scheduled to take a bus tour of  New York  and
Pennsylvania campuses to discuss making college more affordable.
The administration has proposed giving more aid to schools with
moderate tuition increases and strong educational outcomes --and
yanking funding from those with the highest.  “All of us share responsibility for ensuring that college
is affordable,” U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in a
statement. The report “is a reminder that we need state policy
makers and individual colleges and universities to do their part
in taking action against rising college tuition.”  Forty percent of undergraduates took out federal  student
loans  in 2011-2012, up from 35 percent in 2007-2008, according
to the new data. Forty-two percent received federal grants, up
from 28 percent.  While federal grants flowed primarily to low-income
students, wealthier families received bigger scholarships from
colleges than poorer ones. On average, dependent undergraduates
from families earning $100,000 or more received $10,200 in
grants, compared with $8,000 from families earning less than
$20,000. About an equal percentage of students from high- and
low-income backgrounds -- just under 40 percent -- received
grants from colleges.  Colleges are using financial aid to lure rich students in
pursuit of prestige and revenue, shortchanging the poor,
according to a May report from the  New America Foundation , a
Washington nonprofit research group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
