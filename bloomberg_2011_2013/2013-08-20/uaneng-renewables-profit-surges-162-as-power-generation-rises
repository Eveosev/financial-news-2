Huaneng Renewables Corp. (958) , a clean-energy unit of  China ’s biggest electricity producer, said its
first-half earnings more than doubled on an increase of wind
power sales.  Net income rose to 646.1 million  yuan  ($105.5 million) from
246.2 million yuan a year earlier, the unit of China Huaneng
Group Corp. said today in a filing to the Hong Kong stock
exchange. Sales gained 58.5 percent to 2.87 billion yuan.  “With the power curtailment situation improved in certain
regions, the Company achieved a substantial increase in power
generation and utilization hours,” Huaneng Renewables said in
the statement.  The company has benefited from China’s decision to slow
development of new wind farms to ease grid congestion and allow
projects to operate closer to their installed capacity. China
may add 13 gigawatts of wind power this year, 6 percent less
than a year earlier, Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates.  In March, the National Energy Administration withheld new
wind-park permits from projects in the Jilin,  Inner Mongolia  and
Heilongjiang provinces, where grids are overloaded.  China Longyuan Power Group Corp. (916) , the nation’s biggest
wind-farm developer, yesterday said first-half profit totaled
about 1.46 billion yuan, 0.3 percent up from a year earlier.
Wind-power generation at the company rose 32 percent to 11.1
billion kilowatt-hours.  Huaneng Renewables fell 4.4 percent to close at HK$2.62 in
Hong Kong trading today before the results were announced.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
