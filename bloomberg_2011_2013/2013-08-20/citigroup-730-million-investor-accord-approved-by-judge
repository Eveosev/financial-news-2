Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s $730 million
settlement with investors who claimed the bank misled them about
its condition during the financial crisis was granted final
approval by a federal judge.  U.S. District Judge  Sidney Stein  ruled today that the
settlement, announced in March, is “fair, reasonable and
adequate” and allowed it to go forward.  The agreement resolves a suit by investors who bought
Citigroup bonds and preferred stock from May 2006 through
November 2008. Citigroup, the third-largest  U.S. bank  by assets,
said at the time the settlement was announced that it would be
covered by existing litigation reserves.  In March, Citigroup said it denied the investors’
allegations and that it agreed to the accord to avoid the cost
and uncertainty of litigation.  “Citi is pleased to put this matter behind us,” Mark Costiglio, a bank spokesman, said today in an e-mail.  In the lawsuit, filed in federal court in  Manhattan  in
2008, the investors claimed Citigroup misled purchasers of
48 issues of its corporate bonds. Plaintiffs included the
Louisiana Sheriffs’ Pension and Relief Fund, Minneapolis
Firefighters’ Relief Association and the City of Philadelphia
Board of Pensions and Retirement.  Citigroup’s bonds dropped as losses piled up during the
collapse of the U.S. mortgage market. Its $4 billion of 10-year
notes, issued in November 2007, slid as low as 79.7 cents on the
dollar in 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
firm lost more than $29 billion in 2008 and 2009.  The case is In Re Citigroup Bond Litigation, 08-cv-09522,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
