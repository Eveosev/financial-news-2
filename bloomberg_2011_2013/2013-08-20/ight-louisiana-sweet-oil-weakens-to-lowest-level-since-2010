Light  Louisiana  Sweet oil on the
 spot market  weakened to its lowest premium to West  Texas 
Intermediate since October 2010 as tropical weather faded and
more light shale oil makes its way to the Gulf Coast.  Tropical Storm Erin in the Atlantic Ocean and a low-pressure system in the  Gulf of Mexico  dissipated over the
weekend, reducing fears of a supply disruption. Oil production
in Texas’s Eagle Ford shale formation rose 58 percent to 581,923
barrels a day in May from a year earlier, according to
preliminary data from the Texas Railroad Commission.  “LLS is going to find competition now coming from other
areas of U.S.,” said Carl Larry, president of Oil Outlooks &
Opinions LLC in Houston. “American crudes are all starting to
balance out a little bit. As long as imports remain expensive,
we’re going to see see more and more ways bring shale oil down
to the coasts.”  LLS weakened by 25 cents to $3 a barrel more than WTI at
2:07 p.m., the lowest level since Oct. 26, 2010. Heavy Louisiana
Sweet’s premium also fell 25 cents to $2.75.  The port of  Corpus Christi , Texas,  shipped out  348,000
barrels of crude a day in May, up from 48,000 barrels a day in
May 2012, according to data from the port.  The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port LLC in Clovelly, Louisiana,
the largest waterborne petroleum import terminal in the U.S.,
received 3.7 million barrels of oil from Texas in May, more than
from any foreign country except  Saudi Arabia , according to the
state’s  Department of Natural Resources . LOOP received its first
tanker of domestic crude in August 2012.  LOOP Connections  LOOP is connected by pipeline to St. James, Louisiana,
where LLS is delivered. Shale oils from Eagle Ford and the
Bakken in North Dakota are low-density and have relatively
little sulfur, like LLS.  Mars Blend weakened by 25 cents to a $2.50-a-barrel
discount to WTI, the largest in almost three years. Poseidon’s
discount widened by 50 cents to $2.25 a barrel. Southern Green’s
discount grew by $1.75 to $3.50, and  Thunder Horse  weakened by
$1.50 to a premium of $1.75 a barrel over WTI.  In  Canada , Syncrude remained unchanged at a premium of
$3.30 a barrel to WTI while heavy Western Canada Select weakened
by 50 cents to a $24.50-a-barrel discount to WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
