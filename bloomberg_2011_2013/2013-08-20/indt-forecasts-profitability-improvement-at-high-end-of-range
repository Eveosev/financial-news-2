Lindt & Spruengli AG (LISN) , the world’s
largest maker of premium chocolate, raised its profitability
forecast after reporting first-half earnings that beat estimates
as improving economic growth boosted consumption.  The operating-margin increase this year will be near the
upper end of a targeted 0.2 percentage-point to 0.4 percentage-point range, the Kilchberg, Switzerland-based company said in a
statement today.  First-half net income rose 40 percent to 48.8 million Swiss
francs ($53 million), beating the 44.3 million-franc average of
five analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The sales gain
excluding currency effects was 8.7 percent, led by 13 percent
growth in  North America , the world’s largest chocolate market.  “The global economy reported a slight improvement, which
had a positive impact on consumer sentiment in many countries,”
Lindt said. “In parallel, the pressure of several foreign
currencies on the Swiss franc decreased somewhat.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
