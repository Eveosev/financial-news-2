Canadian  wholesale sales  fell in
June from a record the previous month with declines in every
major category, led by farming and building supplies, adding to
signs of a mid-year slowdown in the world’s 11th largest
economy.  Wholesale sales dropped 2.8 percent to C$48.8 billion
($47.1 billion), the fastest since January 2009, Statistics
 Canada  said today in Ottawa. The decline exceeded the most
pessimistic of 13 estimates in a Bloomberg  survey  that had a
median estimate for a 0.5 percent fall.  Economic growth will be “choppy” in the next few months,
Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said in a July forecast,
with the expansion slowing to a 1 second-quarter percent pace
before accelerating to 3.8 percent in the July-to-September
period. The bank said output has been disrupted by flooding in
 Alberta  and a  Quebec  construction strike.  “We are getting weak numbers in June pointing to a fairly
sizable decline in gross domestic product” of 0.4 percentage
point, said  Paul Ferley , assistant chief economist at Royal Bank
of Canada in Toronto. Canada will probably also report a decline
in June retail sales on Aug. 22 before the monthly GDP figure on
Aug. 30, Ferley said.  The Canadian dollar depreciated 0.5 percent to C$1.0395 per
 U.S. dollar  at 9:51 a.m. It touched C$1.0401, the weakest since
Aug. 8. One dollar buys 96.20 U.S. cents.  Widespread Decline  All seven major categories tracked by the agency fell in
June. Building material and supplies sales slipped 3 percent to
C$6.69 billion, and motor vehicles and parts dropped 2.2 percent
to C$8.20 billion. Agricultural supplies plunged 22.6 percent to
C$2.02 billion, offsetting a similar increase the month before,
to lead an 8 percent drop by miscellaneous wholesalers.  The declines were also spread across seven of Canada’s 10
provinces, with the manufacturing hub of Ontario accounting for
almost 70 percent of the national drop,  Statistics Canada  said.
Sales fell 1.5 percent in Alberta and 2.6 percent in Quebec.  The volume of wholesale sales, which removes the impact of
price changes, dropped 2.9 percent.  Inventories increased 0.8 percent to C$62.4 billion in
June, boosting the  ratio  of inventories to sales to 1.28, the
highest since August 2009, from 1.23.  Wholesale sales were 1.4 percent lower in June than the
same month  a year earlier .  To contact the reporter on this story:
