JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  sold $102.7
million of notes tied to the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the
bank’s largest such offering since at least 2010.  The one-year securities, issued Aug. 16, yield twice the
gains of the benchmark, with returns capped at 15.7 percent and
all capital at risk, according to a prospectus filed with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The bank, which
distributed the notes for a 1 percent fee, estimated their
initial value at 99 cents on the dollar.  Issuers have sold $5.21 billion of securities linked to the
stock benchmark this year, 23 percent less than the $6.76
billion during the same period in 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan has issued $291.2 million of
notes tied to the index in 2013, less than half the $585.7
million during same period last year.  Justin Perras , a spokesman for the bank in New York,
declined to comment.  The  benchmark  of 500 U.S. companies, which is the most
popular underlying asset for U.S. structured notes, has risen
15.9 percent this year to 1,652.35 at the close of trading
today.  Bloomberg started to collect comprehensive data on SEC-registered structured-note offerings in 2010.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts that
have a value derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and
currencies, or events such as changes in  interest rates  or the
weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
