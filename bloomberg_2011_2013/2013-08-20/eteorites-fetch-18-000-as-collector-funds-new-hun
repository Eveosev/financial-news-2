Shards of rock from outer space
fetched 11,460 pounds ($18,000) at an auction as a British
meteorite collector raised money for his next hunt.  The pieces included a 27.1 gram (0.96 ounce) nugget of the
Russian meteor that landed in Chelyabinsk in February this year,
which sold for 700 pounds, according to the  results  on
auctioneer Lyon & Turnbull’s website. The sale in Edinburgh, the
third by Robert Elliott since 2009, made less than forecast as
some of the most highly estimated meteorites didn’t lure buyers.  Elliott, who began assembling space memorabilia as an 8-year-old boy, moved to  Scotland  from  England  in 1987 after being
relocated to work on a space project for the U.S. and started
hunting for meteorites a few years later, according to the  sale
prospectus . He became a full-time dealer and collector before
focusing all his time on searching for the rocks.  “He approached me about six years ago and I thought the
sales were a brilliant idea,” Gavin Strang, a director at Lyon
& Turnbull, said before the auction. “I thought if he can turn
me onto it then he can turn other people onto meteorites.”  The auction was forecast to reap between 50,000 pounds and
100,000 pounds, Strang said yesterday. A 2.9 kilogram (6.4
pound) piece of Hambleton meteorite was among the lots bidders
passed up. It had a guide range of 7,000 to 10,000 pounds.  Among the 32 of 85 lots that did sell were rings with
mounted pieces of meteorite and an astronaut’s mission patch,
according to Lyon & Turnbull. The most expensive was a chunk of
Seymchan pallasite from  Russia  found originally in 1967, which
sold for a hammer price of 3,200 pounds compared with a guide
range of 1,200 to 1,800 pounds, the results showed.  Muse highlights include Richard Vines on food, Catherine Hickley on European art,  James Russell  on architecture and
 Amanda Gordon ’s Scene Last Night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
