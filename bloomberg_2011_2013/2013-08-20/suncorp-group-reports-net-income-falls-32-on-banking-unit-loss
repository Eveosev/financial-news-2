Suncorp Group Ltd. (SUN) , an Australian
lender and insurer, posted a 32 percent decline in full-year
profit in line with its guidance last month.  Net income  for the year to June 30 was A$491 million ($443
million) compared with A$724 million a year earlier, hurt by a
loss on the sale of its mostly soured loan portfolio. Suncorp’s
banking unit recorded a loss of A$343 million, compared with a
profit of A$26 million a year earlier, the Brisbane-based
company said in a statement today.  Chief Executive Officer Patrick Snowball has focused on
exiting commercial property loans, corporate lending, and leases
that were worth A$18 billion in 2009 to reduce risk and steer
Suncorp toward insurance, and personal and small business
lending. He is also paying out special dividends to return
excess capital to shareholders.  “The sale of the non-core bank is a relief and enables the
group to focus on the profitable core businesses,”  David Ellis ,
a Sydney-based analyst at  Morningstar Inc. (MORN) , said in an e-mailed
statement.  The company now has a clear structure with a single bank,
single general insurance company and single life insurance
business, Snowball said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television.  Surplus Capital  Suncorp will pay a special  dividend  of 20 cents in addition
to a final dividend of 30 cents, according to today’s statement.
With A$847 million of capital in excess of operating targets,
Snowball did not rule out further capital return.  “We are still using the assumptions of a year ago in
establishing that surplus,” he said. “As we  start to work
through the changes, including the run off of the non-core bank,
we will be revisiting the state of that surplus.”  The lender and insurer also said it expects annual cost
savings to reach A$225 million in 2015 and A$265 million the
next year.  Suncorp said July 31 it expected to post a full-year profit
of A$480 million to A$500 million.  Shares in the company ended 1.5 percent higher at A$12.60
in Sydney, the highest closing level in three weeks. That
extended gains for the year to 24 percent compared to a 9.7
percent gain for the benchmark  S&P/ASX200 Index. (AS51)   To contact the reporter on this story:
