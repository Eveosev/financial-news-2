German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said  Greece  will need a new aid program to reach its
debt sustainability targets, while ruling out another debt cut.  Speaking at an election event in the town of Ahrensburg
near Hamburg today, Schaeuble said the first debt reduction for
Greece was “unique” and won’t be repeated even as the
country’s economic situation remains difficult.  “There will have to be a program for Greece once again,”
Schaeuble said in a speech to around 150 party supporters of his
Christian Democratic Union. “That’s been said a long time ago.
The public, the Bundestag have always been told.”  Schaeuble’s comments, made less than five weeks before
German federal elections, are his clearest indication yet that
the euro region will eventually resort to the “further measures
and assistance” for Greece that were agreed in principle by the
bloc’s finance ministers in November last year.  “The Greeks need until 2020 until they have re-established
debt sustainability according to the calculations we made then -
- and they weren’t overly pessimistic,” Schaeuble said. “We
will have to help them again so that they don’t have to pay such
high interest rates for this maturity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
