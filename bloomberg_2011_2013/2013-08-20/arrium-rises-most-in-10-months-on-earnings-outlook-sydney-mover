Arrium Ltd. (ARI) , the Australian
steelmaker and iron ore producer, rose the most in 10 months in
Sydney trading after it forecast earnings will rise in the next
year on strong demand in China and a declining local currency.  Arrium rose 15 percent to A$1.145 at 12:10 a.m., the most
since Oct. 1, 2012.  Australia ’s benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index
declined 0.4 percent.  The Sydney-based company expects earnings from its steel
unit to improve as it benefits from a decline in the Australian
dollar, it said today in a statement. The currency has fallen 12
percent this year. Mining unit earnings are forecast to rise
after the company completed expansion work to double iron ore
sales volumes to 12 million tons a year, and on strong demand
for the steel-making ingredient in  China , Arrium said.  “If you look across the whole portfolio, it is growing
quite well,” said Evan Lucas, a Melbourne-based market
strategist at IG Markets Ltd.  Arrium had a net loss of A$695 million ($631 million) in
the 12 months to June 30, from net income of A$58 million a year
earlier, after it booked A$961 million in impairment and
restructuring charges, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
