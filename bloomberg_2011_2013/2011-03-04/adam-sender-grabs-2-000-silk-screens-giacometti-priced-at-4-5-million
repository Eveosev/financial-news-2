Hedge-fund manager Adam Sender’s
curator made her way through the mega-souk on the Hudson that is  New York ’s Armory Show Wednesday and stopped at the Untitled
booth for Andrew Hahn.  “I think everyone is in love with these,” said Sarah
Aibel.  She and  London  collector  Anita Zabludowicz  were among those
who picked up his silk-screens which riff on the art world.  One piece, in black and white, depicts a man at a counter
with a caption that reads, “This is the  art dealer . He sells
the things that are good for you.”  They cost $2,000 per silk-screen. The gallery has 60 of
them and sold 55 on the first day.  Also browsing through the 274 galleries from 31 countries
were Lightyear Capital LLC chairman, Don B. Marron, oil trader
Andrew Hall, Greek shipping heir Stavros Niarchos and Warren Eisenberg, co-chairman of  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY)   Lower-priced works by younger artists sold briskly. And
keep in mind that the offering price often gets bargained down
by collectors with clout.  Los Angeles-based dealer David Kordansky placed three
vibrant Primitivist paintings by West Coast artist Ruby Neri,
with prices ranging from $14,000 to $18,000.  Gilbert and George  Blue-chip galleries with affordable works by established
artists also did well.  By 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday,  Lehmann Maupin  gallery had sold
half of the 52 artworks by British conceptual duo Gilbert and
George. They consist of 13 postcards of London’s tourist and sex
attractions. Each was offered at 17,000 pounds ($27,667).  “With $60,000 and under there is a comfort level in
pulling the trigger,” said New York dealer Marianne Boesky, who
sold paintings and sculptures in that range by artists Rachel
Feinstein, Diana Al-Hadid and Hans Op de Beeck.  So far, the most expensive piece in Boesky’s booth, a
ceramic childlike creature by Japanese artist Yoshitomo Nara,
was still looking for a buyer with $275,000.  Paul McCarthy’s small, intricate silver sculpture depicting
cowboys and pirates mashed together also hadn’t found a home at
$500,000.  “We have multiple holds on this work so it will go,” said
Marc Payot, partner and director at  Hauser & Worth . “It just
takes more time.”  Missing Hirst  Works by  Damien Hirst , once ubiquitous at the fair, were
not easily seen.    White Cube , Hirst’s London dealer, lined its booth with
subdued works including two abstract canvases by Sergej Jensen,
offered for 38,000 euros ($53,000) and 42,000 euros. The
gallery’s Hirsts, including a 2007 spin painting priced at
250,000 pounds ($406,500), were in a closet.  Also missing were major New York galleries, which either
decided to skip this week’s fairs or opted for the smaller, top-
quality expo organized by the Art Dealers Association of America
at the Park Avenue Armory.  There, the VIP opening on Tuesday night attracted
philanthropist Agnes Gund, Peter S. Kraus, chairman and CEO of
AllianceBernstein LP/USA, and directors and curators of major
U.S. museums.  The early sales included an Alberto Giacometti bust of his
Japanese friend Isaku Yanaihara, which was offered for $4.5
million at the booth of New York’s  Acquavella Galleries .    David Zwirner  quickly sold two  oil paintings  by Alice Neel,
whose estate he represents. A 1980 portrait of the artist’s
tired-looking daughter-in-law was offered for $850,000; a
smaller 1933 canvas had a price tag of $500,000.  “The world is no less fragile than it once was, but
collectors are reassured by the market,” said New York art
dealer  Peter Freeman . “Museums also came back because they feel
they have money again.”  (Katya Kazakina is a reporter for Muse, the arts and
