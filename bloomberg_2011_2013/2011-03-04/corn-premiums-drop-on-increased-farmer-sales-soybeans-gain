Cash premiums for corn shipped this
month to terminals near  New Orleans  narrowed relative to Chicago
futures on rising deliveries to elevators for shipment down the  Mississippi River . Soybean premiums rose.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered in March
at  Gulf of Mexico  ports fell to 48 cents to 52 cents a bushel
above May futures from 51 cents to 52 cents yesterday, U.S.
Department of Agriculture  data  show. The soybean basis was 64
cents to 68 cents a bushel above May futures, up from 64 cents
to 66 cents.  “A large amount of corn was booked for delivery in March,
and that grain is flowing into the shipping pipeline,” said
Dave Marshall, a marketing consultant for Toay Commodity Futures
Group LLC in Nashville,  Illinois . “Farmers and merchants sold
most of their soybean inventories earlier because of fears of
big crops in  South America . Now, it is getting difficult to
source supplies.”  Corn futures for May delivery fell 8.75 cents, or 1.2
percent, to close at $7.28 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price rose 0.8 percent this week, the fifth straight
gain.  Soybean futures for May delivery advanced 2 cents, or 0.2
percent, to close at $14.14 a bushel. The price gained 2.8
percent this week.  The cost of moving grain by barge along the Mississippi
River from  St. Louis  to New Orleans today rose to 500 percent of
the 1976 published tariff rates from 400 percent a week earlier,
Marshall said. That’s the equivalent of adding about 13 cents to
14 cents to the cost of shipping grain to export terminals, he
said.  “Heavy rain is raising water levels along both the
Mississippi and Ohio rivers to near flood stages,” boosting the
cost of shipping, Marshall said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
