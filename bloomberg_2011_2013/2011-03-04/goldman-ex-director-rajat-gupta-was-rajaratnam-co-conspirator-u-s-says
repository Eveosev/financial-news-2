Rajat Gupta, a former member of the
board of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and the former head of
McKinsey & Co., was a co-conspirator with Raj Rajaratnam, the
Galleon Group LLC founder at the center of a probe of insider
trading at hedge funds, a U.S. prosecutor said. Gupta passed
information to Rajaratnam about Goldman’s earnings and about an
investment  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  made in Goldman, the
prosecutor said in a pre-trial court conference. Prosecutors
have not charged Gupta criminally. Rajaratnam’s criminal trial
starts March 8.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
