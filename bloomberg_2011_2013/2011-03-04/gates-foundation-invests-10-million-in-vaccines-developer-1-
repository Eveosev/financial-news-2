The  Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation 
invested $10 million in Liquidia Technologies, a closely held
biotechnology company developing vaccines, as part of a $400
million initiative to fund activities to help poorer countries.  Liquidia is developing a seasonal  flu vaccine  and has an
agreement with the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative to use its
technology to work on new malaria vaccines, the Research
Triangle Park, North Carolina-based company said today in an e-
mailed statement. The $400 million program provides low-interest
loans, loan guarantees and equity investments to help finance
organizations that meet the group’s focus areas.    Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  Chairman and co-founder Bill Gates, in his
2010 annual foundation  letter , highlighted the need for a
malaria vaccine to eradicate the disease, calling it “the
highest-risk malaria work we fund.” The foundation has supplied
$13.8 billion in global health funding since 1994, according to
its  website .  “Funding innovation is a key to addressing the unmet
health needs of the world’s poorest people,” Doug Holtzman,
deputy director for the foundation’s infectious diseases team,
said in the statement. “This unique investment partnership will
help us advance vaccine development as part of our commitment to
help research, develop and deliver vaccines for the world’s
poorest countries.”  Liquidia investors also include Canaan Partners,  New
Enterprise Associates , PPD Inc., Morningside Venture Investments
Limited, Pappas Ventures and Firelake Capital, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
