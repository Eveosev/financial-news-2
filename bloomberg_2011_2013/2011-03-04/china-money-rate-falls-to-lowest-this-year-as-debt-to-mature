  China ’s benchmark money-market rate
fell to the lowest this year on speculation debt maturing in
March will add funds to the banking system.  There will be 687 billion yuan ($105 billion) of fixed-
income securities maturing in March, according to  Frances Cheung ,
a senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong . The
central bank sold three-month bills in open-market operations
yesterday at a yield of 2.63 percent, a rate almost unchanged
from last week’s sale. Policy makers have lifted banks’ reserve-
requirement ratios five times since October.  “The auction yield on the three-month central bank bill
was virtually unchanged from the last issue, with a small
difference due to a technical reason, leading to market
expectations for no imminent rate hike,” Cheung said.  The seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge measuring the
availability of funds, dropped 23 basis points to 2.22 percent,
according to a daily fixing from the National Interbank Funding
Center published at 11 a.m. in  Shanghai . That’s the lowest level
since Dec. 7. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The one-year swap contract tied to the seven-day repo rate
slipped five basis points to 3.79 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the government’s 3.77 percent bond due
December 2020 climbed two basis points to 3.96 percent,
according to Chinabond, the nation’s biggest debt-clearing house.
That’s the biggest increase since Feb. 25.  The People’s Bank of China last ordered lenders to set
aside more money as reserves on Feb. 24, raising the ratio by
half a percentage point to 19.5 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
