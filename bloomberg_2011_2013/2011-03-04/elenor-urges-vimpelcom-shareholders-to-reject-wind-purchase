  Telenor ASA (TEL) , the Nordic region’s
largest phone company, asked fellow  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  shareholders
to reject VimpelCom’s proposed merger of its telecommunications
assets with those of Egyptian billionaire  Naguib Sawiris .  Telenor suggested VimpelCom pay an extra dividend of at
least $1 a share instead of pursuing the merger with Sawiris’s
Wind Telecom, it said in a letter dated March 2.  “The excessive focus on the Wind Telecom transaction has
already harmed the interests of all VimpelCom shareholders, as
VimpelCom has fallen from second to third place in the Russian
market,” Fornebu, Norway-based Telenor said in the letter.  Telenor opposes a plan by mobile-phone operator VimpelCom
to issue new stock representing 20 percent of shares outstanding
and 31 percent of  voting rights  to investors in Wind Telecom.
The Norwegian company argues that most of Wind’s profit comes
from Italy, which is a mature market counter to VimpelCom’s
strategy of investing in emerging markets.  Telenor shareholders will meet on March 17 to vote on the
issue of 630 million shares needed to complete the combination
with Wind Telecom in a deal valued at about $6.5 billion. On
March 1, a court in London rejected Telenor’s request for an
order blocking the meeting.  The Norwegian company  holds  more than 39 percent of
VimpelCom shares, approximately the same stake as Russia’s  Alfa
Group , which supports the merger. Alfa Group, which participates
in VimpelCom through its telecom subsidiary Altimo, has 44.7
percent of votes to Telenor’s 36 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
