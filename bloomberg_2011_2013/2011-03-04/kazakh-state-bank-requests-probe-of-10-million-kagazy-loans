The  Development Bank  of  Kazakhstan ,
a state-owned lender, is seeking a probe by law-enforcement
authorities into an alleged “misappropriated” use of $10
million borrowed by units of  Kazakhstan Kagazy Plc. (KAG)   The bank turned to authorities after a technical audit to
review a request by Kagazy, the largest paper producer in
Central Asia, to restructure $70 million of debt, the Astana-
based lender said in an e-mailed statement today.  Nelli Kim, a spokeswoman for Kagazy, declined to comment
immediately when contacted by Bloomberg News in Almaty. The
company may issue a statement later today, she said.  The bank declined the plan to restructure debt of two
Kagazy units, AO Astana Contract and TOO Paragon Developments,
which oversee a container and warehouse terminal in Almaty,
according to the statement.  Kagazy, which was barred from selling 12 billion tenge ($82
million) of domestic bonds last April after the company failed
to make coupon payments on previously issued bonds, sought last
year to restructure 15.6 billion tenge of total debt.  Kagazy agreed to extend the maturity of its $37.2 million
bonds from 2013 to 2028, the company said on March 1. It also
reached an agreement with Alliance Bank, the second biggest
Kazakh lender to default in 2009, to extend maturity and cut
interest rate for $29.3 million loan in November.  To contact the reporters on this story:
