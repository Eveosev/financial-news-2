Allen Iverson, a former  National
Basketball Association  most valuable player and 11-time All-
Star, has stopped paying the mortgage on his 6,848-square-foot
house in Cherry Hills,  Colorado , the  Denver Post   report ed.  Iverson, 35, who purchased the property in 2008 for $3.88
million, let the six-bedroom, nine-bathroom home slip into
foreclosure and owes more than $2.5 million to Wells Fargo Bank,
the Post reported, citing a Notice of Election and Demand for
Sale filed in Coloradoâ€™s Arapahoe County on Feb. 28.  The house was for sale and scheduled to close for about the
asking price of $2.85 million, according to the newspaper.
Though the sale is allowed to continue, Iverson may be forced to
pay attorney fees, foreclosure costs and default interest, real
estate attorney Alan D. Sweetbaum told the Post.  Iverson, who won the 2000-01 NBA MVP award, played for four
NBA teams in his 14-year career. He played for the  Denver
Nuggets  in 2006 to 2008. In October, he agreed to a two-year, $4
million contract with the Turkish basketball club  Besiktas .  To contact the reporter on this story:
