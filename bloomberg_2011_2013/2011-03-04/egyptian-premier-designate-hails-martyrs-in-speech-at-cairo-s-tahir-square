Egyptian Prime Minister-designate
Essam Sharaf addressed a rally in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, saying
that his legitimacy was derived from the people as he saluted
the “martyrs” who lost their lives in the fight to unseat
President  Hosni Mubarak .  “You have accomplished a great deed. The greatest thing
would be for us to rebuild  Egypt ,” Sharaf told thousands
gathered in the square, the hub of mass protests that led to the
end of Mubarak’s 30-year rule. “I ask God that I see Egypt a
free country,” and that “the security bodies be in the service
of the country and people,” Sharaf said.  The speech was Sharaf’s first address to Egyptians after
the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces asked him to form
a new Cabinet yesterday. The council, which took interim
authority from Mubarak, accepted the resignation of former Prime
Minister Ahmed Shafik after protesters demanded he leave the
Cabinet along with other ministers appointed by Mubarak.  The designation of Sharaf, a former transportation
minister, has been welcomed by many protesters and opposition
figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
