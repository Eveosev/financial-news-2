European stocks pared gains after a
report showed that U.S. payrolls added 192,000 workers in
February. Asian stocks rose and U.S. index futures swung between
gains and losses.  Hermes International SCA increased 1.5 percent after the
maker of leather handbags and silk scarves said its operating-
profit margin rose more than it had forecast.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index was unchanged at
283.59 at 1:47 p.m. in  London , after earlier gaining as much as
0.7 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
