Khamis Qaddafi, one of the sons of
Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi , has been expelled from  Madrid ’s
IE business school, a spokeswoman for the institution said.  Khamis Qaddafi, 27, had been following the 58,200 euro-per-
year ($81,320) international MBA program since April 2010 and
was meant to be doing an internship in the U.S. when the popular
uprising in Libya started last month, said Juncal Sanchez, a
spokeswoman. He was expelled because of “his links to the
attacks against the Libyan population,” she said.  Forces loyal to Muammar Qaddafi have used violence to quell
a rebellion and 6,000 people have been killed, the rebel forces’
spokesman, Colonel Abdullah Al Mahdi, said on Al Jazeera
television today. Khamis Qaddafi is leading an elite brigade
against the rebels, the  Associated Press  reported on March 1.  In the U.K., the  London School  of Economics and Political
Science’s director, Howard Davies, resigned amid an inquiry into
a donation to the university from the Gaddafi International
Charity and Development Foundation, the acceptance of $50,000 in
return for his advice to Libya’s sovereign-wealth fund, a
contract to train Libyan civil servants and the academic
authenticity of the 2008 doctoral thesis it awarded another of
Qaddafi’s sons, Saif.  IE hasn’t received any donations from the Libyan
government, Sanchez said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
