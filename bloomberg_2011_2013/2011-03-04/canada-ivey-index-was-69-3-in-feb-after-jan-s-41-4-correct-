  Canada ’s Ivey purchasing managers’
index rose for the first time in three months in February as
indexes for employment and prices increased.  Canada’s Ivey purchasing managers’ index was 69.3 in
February after a January reading of 41.4, according to a
statement on the University of Western Ontario business school’s
website.  The Ivey School reported a seasonally adjusted figure for
the first time today, saying the index was 70.8 on that basis in
February after 46.8 in January. Readings greater than 50
indicate increased purchasing by governments and companies.  The gauge has covered the purchasing intentions of 175
government and company managers for a decade, and the sample
size will be doubled over the next few months. The firms that
are asked to participate will also shift to mirror changes in
Canada’s economic output, Michiel Leenders, who manages the
index, said in a Feb. 24 interview.  The unadjusted employment index rose to 56.3 in February
from 47.4 in January, indicating managers are building their
workforces. The  price index  advanced to 77.4 in February from
68.2 in January.  The inventory gauge rose to 57 in February from 52.9 in
January, signaling that stockpiles were higher, and the decline
in the supplier-deliveries measure to 37 signaled shipments were
slower than the previous month.  On a seasonally adjusted basis, the price index advanced to
77.6 in February from 63.6 in January, and the employment
measure rose to 61.9 from 51.6.  The supplier-delivery index fell to 38.3 from 44.1 on a
seasonally adjusted basis. The inventory measure rose to 55 from
53.5, the Ivey report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
