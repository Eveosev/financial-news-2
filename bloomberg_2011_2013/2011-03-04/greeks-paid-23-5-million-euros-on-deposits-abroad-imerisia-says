Measures to combat  tax evasion  by
persuading people to declare money sent outside  Greece  brought
in 23.5 million euros ($33 million) in  tax revenue ,  Imerisia 
reported, citing the deputy finance minister.  The amount of money that Greeks declared in bank accounts
abroad amounted to 405 million euros, Dimitrios Kouselas told
Greeceâ€™s parliament yesterday, the newspaper reported. He said
the government had expected a bigger response, Imerisia said.  Kouselas said the Greek finance ministry had collected data
on people holding assets in accounts abroad, and that the
government was seeking an accord with  Switzerland , where many
accounts are held, on dealing with the issue, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
