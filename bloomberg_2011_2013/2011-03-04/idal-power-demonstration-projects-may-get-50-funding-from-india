India’s Ministry of New and  Renewable Energy  said it may provide financial incentives for as
much as 50 percent of the cost for projects seeking to
demonstrate how to produce electricity from ocean tides.  The ministry is considering providing the financial
incentives to state agencies to develop tidal energy projects as
technology demonstration projects, according to a written
response to parliament by Minister of New and Renewable Energy
Farooq Abdullah.  India may have the potential to produce more than 8,000
megawatts of tidal power along its western coast, he said. A
government study has found 7,000 megawatts of potential in the
Gulf of Cambay and 1,200 megawatts in the Gulf of Kutch, both
located in Gujarat state, he said.  The ministry has approved a 3.75-megawatt demonstration
plant on  India ’s eastern coast that will be developed by the
 West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency , he said. West
Bengal’s Gangetic Delta could hold as much as 100 megawatts of
potential, he said.  India also may have the potential to develop as much as
15,000 megawatts of capacity from small hydropower plants of
less than 25 megawatts each, he said.  India provided 1.4 billion rupees ($31 million) of
financial assistance to small hydropower projects in the year to
Feb. 28, he said. Currently, India has 2,953 megawatts of small
hydropower plants installed and another 914 megawatts under
construction, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
