  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) ,  Australia ’s
largest gold producer, rose the most in three months after
reporting drill results at a gold deposit in  Papua New Guinea .  Newcrest rose 4.7 percent, the most since Dec. 2, to
A$40.02 at the 4:10 p.m. close of Sydney trading. It has
advanced 19 percent over the past twelve months, compared with
the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index’s 2.4 percent gain.  Recent drilling results at Wafi Golpu in Morobe Province, a
joint venture of Newcrest with Harmony Gold Mining Co Ltd.,
included the highest gold grade intersections to date of more
than three grams of gold a metric ton, Newcrest said in a
presentation prior to a global investor roadshow in March.  “Deep drilling undertaken and reported in recent quarters
continues to demonstrate that the Golpu porphyry deposit may be
significantly larger than the reported resource,” the company
said in a statement.  Newcrest plans to conclude a feasibility study for the
development by the end of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
