The Swiss franc rose against all of
its 16 most-traded counterparts as crude oil climbed to a 29-
month high on concern turmoil in North Africa and the Mideast
will disrupt supply, encouraging investors to seek refuge.  The dollar lost the most in a five days versus the euro in
six weeks on speculation a gain in U.S. payrolls last month
won’t be enough to spur the  Federal Reserve  to raise interest
rates soon even as the  European Central Bank  prepares to lift
its borrowing costs.  “We’re seeing a certain amount of flight to quality
because of concerns in the Middle East,” said Dennis Cajigas, a
senior market strategist at the brokerage MF Global Holdings
Ltd. in  Chicago . “The Swissie is making big moves largely due
to that.”  The franc rose 0.8 percent to 92.45 centimes per dollar at
5 p.m. in New York, from 93.16 yesterday, and strengthened 0.4
percent for the week. It reached a record high of 92.02 centimes
on March 2. The Swiss currency gained 0.6 percent against the
euro to 1.2933, from 1.3013.  The greenback weakened 0.1 percent to $1.3987 per euro,
from $1.3969 yesterday, after earlier gaining 0.2 percent. It
reached $1.40 for the first time since Nov. 8. The shared
currency was little changed at 115.13 yen, and the dollar fell
0.2 percent to 82.32 yen.  Bets on Euro  Futures traders increased bets the euro will gain versus
the dollar to the most since January 2008, figures from the
Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on an advance in the euro compared with
those on a drop -- so-called net longs -- was 51,308 on the week
ended March 1, the most since Jan. 11, 2008.  Forces loyal to  Libya ’s Muammar Qaddafi used tear gas and
gunfire to suppress protests in Tripoli as rebels pushed their
front lines westward to Ras Lanuf, an oil port town about
halfway to the capital from opposition-stronghold Benghazi. The
conflict has left 6,000 people dead, the opposition forces’
spokesman, Abdullah Al Mahdi, told  Al Jazeera  today.  Crude oil for April delivery rose as much as 3.2 percent to
$105.17 a barrel in New York, the highest level since September
2008.  U.S. stocks declined, with the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index dropping 0.7 percent.  The franc tends to strengthen during periods of financial
stress because  Switzerland ’s export-reliant economy doesn’t need
foreign capital to balance the current account, the broadest
measure of trade.  The dollar fluctuated against the euro after Labor
Department data showed U.S. employers added 192,000 workers in
February, compared with a Bloomberg News survey forecast for
196,000. The  unemployment rate  unexpectedly fell to 8.9 percent,
the lowest level since April 2009.  ECB ‘Out Front’  “The unemployment number was by no means a blowout number
that’s going to make the Fed consider tightening any time
soon,” said Boris Schlossberg, director of research at online
currency trader GFT Forex in New York. “That leaves the ECB way
out front in terms of interest-rate differential.”  The greenback tumbled yesterday after ECB President Jean- Claude Trichet said the central bank may increase  interest rates 
at its next meeting to counter inflation pressures. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  reiterated on March 1 in Senate testimony that
while growth will quicken in the U.S., he still wants to see a
“sustained period of stronger  job creation .”  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks
the greenback against the currencies of six major trade
partners, lost 1.1 percent for the week as investors speculated
the Fed would lag behind other central banks in raising interest
rates. The gauge is weighted 57.6 percent to movements in the
euro, which surged 1.7 percent against the dollar this week, the
most since the five days ended Jan. 21.  Brazil’s Real Falls  The Brazilian real dropped 0.3 percent to 1.6546 per
dollar, erasing earlier gains, after a report that the nation’s
government may announce new measures next week to curb the
currency’s appreciation.  The moves could include a tax increase and stricter
controls of foreign capital and could be announced March 9 or
10, the Sao Paulo-based IG news service reported without saying
where it got the information.    New Zealand ’s dollar fell against most major counterparts
after the  International Monetary Fund  said it will likely cut
the nation’s growth forecast.  The kiwi, as the currency is nicknamed, touched its weakest
level in five months against the greenback. It reached 73.39
U.S. cents today, the lowest level since Oct. 1, before trading
at 73.83 cents, down 1.8 percent from 75.16 on Feb. 25. It
slipped 0.4 percent today.  N.Z. Earthquakes  The  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand will reduce its benchmark
rate by 15 basis points over the next 12 months, compared with a
prediction for an increase of 54 basis points a month ago,
according to a Credit Suisse Group AG index. Two earthquakes in
the past six months may have caused as much as NZ$20 billion
($15 billion) of damage, Prime Minister John Key has said.  The South Korean won gained versus most major peers, rising
0.5 percent to 1,114.60 per dollar. Asian currencies
strengthened this week, with the Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar
Index increasing 0.4 percent, on speculation central banks will
tolerate appreciation and raise borrowing costs to tame
inflation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
