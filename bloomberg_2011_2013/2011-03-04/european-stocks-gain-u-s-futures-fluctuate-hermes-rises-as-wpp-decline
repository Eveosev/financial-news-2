European stocks gained before a
report that may show U.S. payrolls increased last month, adding
to signs that the economy is improving. Asian stocks rose and
U.S. index futures were little changed.  Hermes International SCA added 1.2 percent after the maker
of leather handbags and silk scarves said full-year profit rose
46 percent.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 0.3 percent to
284.39 at 9:00 a.m. in  London .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
