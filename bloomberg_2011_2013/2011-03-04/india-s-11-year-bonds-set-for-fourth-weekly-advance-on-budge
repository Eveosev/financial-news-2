  India ’s 11-year bonds completed a
fourth weekly gain on speculation a government pledge to reduce
the  budget deficit  will result in less debt being sold.  The shortfall will ease to 4.6 percent of gross domestic
product in the 12 months through March 2012 from 5.1 percent in
the current period, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in
his budget speech this week. An index measuring wholesale prices
of agricultural products rose 10.4 percent in the week ended Feb.
19 from a year earlier, the commerce ministry said yesterday.
The gain is the least since Nov. 27 and compares with an 11.5
percent increase the previous week.  “Bonds have rallied after the budget as a lower deficit
may translate into lower debt sales,” said  Anoop Verma , a
fixed-income trader at Development Credit Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.
“Softening food prices are also helping investors.”  The yield on the 8.08 percent bond due August 2022, the
government’s most-traded debt, fell seven basis points this week
to 8.08 percent at the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the
central bank’s trading system. The rate rose two basis points
today. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The government plans debt sales of 4.17 trillion rupees
($92.7 billion) in the next fiscal year, less than the 4.27
trillion rupees raised in the past 11 months, Mukherjee said on
Feb. 28.  India’s  finance ministry  sought parliament’s approval to
spend an extra 795.9 billion rupees ($17.7 billion) in the year
ending March 31, the ministry said in the supplementary demand
for grants presented in parliament today.  Of this amount, 689.18 billion rupees will be the net cash
outflow, it said.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
fell 10 basis points this week to 7.41 percent. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
