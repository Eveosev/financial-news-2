  BASF SE (BAS) , the worldâ€™s biggest
chemical company, said that a leak of poisonous gas at its
Ludwigshafen, Germany site, has been stopped and no-one was
injured.  About 200 cubic meters of oxo gas, carbon dioxide and water
vapor leaked from a plant at about 9 a.m. this morning, the
Ludwigshafen-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.
BASF halted production at part of the plant to contain the leak,
it said.  Oxo gas, which is used to make softening agents and washing
powder ingredients, is highly flammable and poisonous, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
