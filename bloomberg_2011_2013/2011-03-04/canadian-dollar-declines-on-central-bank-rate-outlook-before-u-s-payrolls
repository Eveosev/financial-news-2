  Canada ’s dollar had a weekly drop
against most of its major counterparts including the euro after  Bank of Canada  Governor  Mark Carney  reiterated on March 1 that a
strong currency poses challenges to exports.  The loonie stayed within a cent of a three-year high
against the greenback after a U.S. report showed Canada’s
largest trading partner added fewer jobs in February than
economists forecast. Crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, rose to
a 29-month high on concern Libyan unrest will spread to other
oil producers in North Africa and the Mideast and curb exports.  “The commodities story is obviously good for Canada, but
at the same time, the strength of the currency is taking some of
the monetary stimulus out of the bank,” said  Steve Butler ,
director of foreign-exchange trading at Bank of Nova Scotia’s
Scotia Capital unit in Toronto. “The bank was as least-hawkish
as it could be.”  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, traded at C$1.3616 versus
the euro at 5 p.m. in Toronto, compared with C$1.3579 yesterday.
The loonie had a 1.3 percent weekly drop.  Crude oil for April delivery increased 2.5 percent to
$104.42 a barrel in New York trading. The contract has increased
7.1 percent this week and advanced 30 percent from a year ago.  The Bank of Canada, which led the Group of Seven nations
with three interest-rate increases last year, held its target
rate for overnight lending between commercial banks at 1 percent
on March 1, where it has been since September.  Carney on Currency  Exporters still face “considerable challenges” from a  currency trading  near three-year highs and “poor relative
productivity,” Carney and five deputies said in a statement.  “The market was expecting Carney to be a little bit more
hawkish than he was, and that’s the reason for the slowdown in
the appreciation of the Canadian dollar,” said Firas Askari,
head currency trader at Bank of Montreal in Toronto.  The rate on the June 2011 bankers’ acceptance contract
dropped today to 1.46 percent, from 1.50 percent the day before
the Bank of Canada’s decision. So-called Bax contracts have
settled an average of about 0.20 percentage point above the
central bank’s target rate since 1992, Bloomberg data show.  The loonie traded at 97.34 cents per  U.S. dollar , compared
with 97.20 yesterday, after reaching 96.84 on March 1, the
strongest level since November 2007. One Canadian dollar
purchases $1.0273. The Canadian currency had a 0.4 percent
weekly gain versus its U.S. counterpart.  ‘Self-Defeating’  “It’s a self-defeating argument trying to buy the Canadian
dollar on the expectations that they’re going to raise  interest
rates ,” said  Andrew Wilkinson , senior market analyst at
Interactive Brokers Group LLC in Greenwich,  Connecticut . A
stronger loonie “is softening the inflation trajectory all the
time, which inherently means they’re not going to have to
tighten rates,” he said.    Government bonds  rose for the first time in three days,
pushing the yield on the 10-year benchmark down six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.33 percent. The price of
the 3.50 percent note maturing in June 2020 increased 49 cents
to C$101.34.  The euro gained against most of its major counterparts this
week, including the Canadian dollar, after European Central Bank
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  signaled yesterday that policy
makers may increase the main refinancing rate next month from a
record low 1 percent to contain inflation.  U.S. Payrolls  U.S. employers added 192,000 workers in February after a
gain of 63,000 in the previous month, the Labor Department
reported today. The median forecast of 84 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for an increase of 196,000. The  unemployment rate  unexpectedly dropped to 8.9 percent last month
from 9 percent.  Canada’s employers added 25,000 jobs in February after an
increase of 69,200 in the previous month, according to the
median forecast of 23 economists before  Statistics Canada ’s
March 11 report. The unemployment rate may have decreased to 7.7
percent, from 7.8 percent.  The Ivey purchasing managers’ index was 69.3 in February
after a January reading of 41.4, according to a statement on the
University of Western Ontario business school’s website today.
Readings of less than 50 indicate purchasing by governments and
companies declined.  To contact the reporter for this story:
