  China Power International
Development Ltd. (2380) , a unit of the nation’s fifth-biggest generator,
will post a profit comparable to 2009, its chairwoman said.  Net income in 2010 was “similar to” a year earlier, Li Xiaolin said in Beijing today. Profit reached 519 million yuan
($79 million) in 2009.  China Power returned to profit in 2009 as demand from the
world’s fastest-growing major economy increased and the
government raised electricity prices. The utility may post 2010
net income of 532 million yuan, according to a mean estimate of
11 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  The utility plans to develop more renewable energy projects
and build additional hydropower plants, Li told reporters at the
annual  Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference .  Electricity sales from hydropower accounted for 3.4 percent
of the utility’s revenue in 2009. Sales from coal-fired
generation formed the rest.  The unit of state-controlled  China  Power Investment Corp.
fell 19 percent in Hong Kong trading in the past year, compared
with the 14 percent gain in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index . The
stock was unchanged at HK$1.54 as of 11:23 a.m. local time.  About 43 percent of coal-fired plants in China had losses
last year because of higher prices, Li said.  In 2010, average benchmark prices for power-station coal
for immediate delivery at Qinhuangdao, China’s largest port for
the fuel, rose 25 percent to 747 yuan a metric ton, according to
data from the China Coal Transport and Distribution Association.
Coal is used as fuel at about 80 percent of the country’s
generators.  --Wang Ying. Editors: Ryan Woo,  Jane Lee .  To contact the reporter on this story:
