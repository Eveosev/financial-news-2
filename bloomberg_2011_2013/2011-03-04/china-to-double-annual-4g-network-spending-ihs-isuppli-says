  China , the world’s largest mobile-
phone market, will double annual spending on fourth-generation  network equipment  in each of the next four years, according to
forecasts from IHS ISuppli.  China’s investment in 4G will double to $100 million this
year from $50 million last year as trials get under way in six
cities, El Segundo, California-based IHS ISuppli forecasts.
Spending will jump to $300 million in 2012, $600 million in 2013
and $1.3 billion in 2014, according to the forecasts.  China’s Ministry of Industry and  Information Technology  in
December gave China Mobile Communications Corp., the world’s
largest carrier by subscribers, approval to begin large-scale
tests of its 4G TD-LTE network in  Shanghai , Hangzhou, Nanjing,
Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Xiamen. IHS ISuppli projects those
trials will reach 100 million subscribers with 100 base
stations.  The nation’s other two carriers, China United Network
Communications Group Co. and China Telecommunications Corp.,
will start deploying 4G systems between 2012 and 2013, the
report said.  China granted the first licenses for third-generation
wireless networks that allow mobile phones to surf the Web in
2009. China was home to 859 million mobile-phone users at the
end of last year. Only 47 million, or 5.5 percent, had upgraded
to 3G service as of the end of December, according to data from
the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.  --Edmond Lococo. Editors: Terje Langeland, Anand Krishnamoorthy  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
