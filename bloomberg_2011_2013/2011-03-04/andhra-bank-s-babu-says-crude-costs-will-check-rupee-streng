Vikas Babu, a currency trader at
state-owned  Andhra Bank  in Mumbai, comments on the outlook for  India ’s rupee.  One-month non-deliverable forwards for the currency gained
0.2 percent to 45.22 per dollar as of 11:37 a.m. in Singapore,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect
bets the rupee will decline 0.6 percent from the spot rate of
44.95.  “For the next week, we will continue to see the rupee in a
range. It will trade between 44.70 and 45.30 as the strength in
the currency is checked by concern of rising oil prices. This
range will continue until and unless we see some event that
gives strength to the rupee.  “If the crisis is aggravated in the Middle East, that will
take the rupee to the weaker side. The thing to watch now is
crude. A hike in the oil price will surely dent economic growth.
If oil prices trickle down, we will see the rupee strengthening.  “The government’s budget-deficit target for next year had
a slight positive impact on the rupee this week. There were some
inflows into stocks as well. We are seeing Asian currencies gain
across the board.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
