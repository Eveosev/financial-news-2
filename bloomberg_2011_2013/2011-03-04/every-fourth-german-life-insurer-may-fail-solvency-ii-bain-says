One in four German life insurers may
fail to meet capital limits under proposed new risk-based
regulation for the industry in Europe, according to a report
published by Bain & Co. and  Towers Watson & Co. (TW)   “Solvency ratios for almost 25 percent of German life
insurers are below the critical limit of 100 percent,” the
consultants said in an e-mailed statement today. “The first
survey results reveal a need for significant action in the  insurance industry  before the introduction of the new rules.”  The European Union’s Solvency II directive, scheduled to
come into effect in 2013, was tested in a fifth quantitative
impact study, named  QIS5 , from August to November. Publication
of the results is planned for this month. The consultants’ study
was based on QIS5 specifications and publicly available
financial data for the 20 biggest providers of life, health, and
property and casualty insurance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
