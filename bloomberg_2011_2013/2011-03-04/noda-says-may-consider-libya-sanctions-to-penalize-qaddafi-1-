Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said the government may consider using sanctions on Libya
to penalize the administration of  Muammar Qaddafi  as it
continues to fight rebels in the country.  When asked by a reporter in Tokyo about whether Japan
might impose financial sanctions on Libya following such action
from the U.S. and U.K., Noda said, “We will act in concert if
we judge this is where we have to take internationally
coordinated action.”  Noda made his comments during a press conference.  The finance minister was speaking as international
pressure on Qaddafi to withdraw from power mounts. In
Washington, President Barack Obama yesterday called anew for
Qaddafi to “step down from power and leave,” and said the U.S.
is sending military and chartered civilian aircraft to help
repatriate foreign workers who fled  Libya  to Tunisia and Egypt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
