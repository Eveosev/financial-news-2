Box-office revenue from 3-D movies
increased 85 percent to $2.2 billion last year in  North America ,
fueled by more films in the three-dimensional format and the
expansion to more theaters.  Higher ticket prices for 3-D films contributed to the
increase, with the average price of $10.84 about 40 percent
higher than a conventional movie, researcher IHS Screen Digest
said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
