A Munich court blocked the
extradition of Klaas Carel Faber who is sought by the
Netherlands after being sentenced to life in prison for murder
and aiding the Nazis during World War II.  Faber would have had to formally agree to an extradition
through a special procedure, which hasn’t happened, the Munich
prosecutors said in an e-mailed statement today.  Faber fled to  Germany  in 1952 after being sentenced to life
in prison by a Dutch court in 1947 for the murder of at least 11
people and for cooperating with the German Sicherheitsdienst,
Tineke Zwart, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor in the city of
Zwolle, said in November. Zwart didn’t immediately return a call
today seeking comment.  Faber’s punishment was reduced to life in prison and in
1952 he escaped to Germany. Attempts to extradite him were
blocked because he had previously been granted German
citizenship and Faber now lives in Ingolstadt in the state of
Bavaria, Zwart said in November.  The Netherlands had issued a European arrest warrant for
Faber.  To contact the reporters on this story:
