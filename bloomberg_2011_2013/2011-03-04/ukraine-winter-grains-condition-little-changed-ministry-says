Ukrainian winter grains’ condition
was little changed as of yesterday compared with two weeks
earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.  Grains covered 8.09 million hectares (20 million acres) and
were in good condition on 56 percent of fields, compared with
56.5 percent as of Feb. 18, the ministry  said  on its website
today. Weak plants came to 6 percent, against 5.9 percent two
weeks earlier.  The wheat crop was in good condition on 57.2 percent of
fields and satisfactory on 37.1 percent, the ministry said. The
total wheat area to be harvested this year is 6.55 million
hectares.  Barley was in good condition on 47.1 percent of the 1.2
million hectares seeded with the grain and satisfactory on 44.5
percent.  Rapeseed in good condition came to 52.1 percent, with 39.6
percent classified as satisfactory, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
