Cyprus’s parliament passed a 20
million-euro ($28 million) compensation package for Cyprus
Airways Ltd. for extra costs incurred as a result of  Turkey ’s
ban on Cypriot traffic using its airspace, the company said.  The approval of the package yesterday strengthens Cyprus
Air’s efforts to secure its long-term viability,’’ the carrier
said today in a  statement  on the  Cyprus News Agency  website.  The Turkish ban increases Cyprus Air’s flight costs,
government spokesman Stefanos Stefanou said on Jan. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
