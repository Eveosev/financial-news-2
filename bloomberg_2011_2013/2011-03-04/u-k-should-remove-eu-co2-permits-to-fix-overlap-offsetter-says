The U.K. should remove European
Union carbon permits from its allocation to factories and power
stations to match emission cuts under its proposed Carbon
Reduction Commitment program, said an offset company.  The so-called CRC program may create 90 million metric tons
of reductions in the period from 2011 through 2020, according to
a report by London-based Carbon Retirement Ltd. Unless the
government removes them from the market, the CRC would free up
permits for use by other emitters in the bloc, making the
program neutral for global climate protection, it said.  “The more successful the CRC is in driving  energy
efficiency , the more allowances will be available to heavy
industry in  Europe ,” it said.  The group , representing companies
and not-for-profits wanting to offset their  carbon emissions ,
buys CO2 permits and takes them out of circulation.  The U.K. Department for Energy and Climate Change has
sought views on the potential implications of an overlap of the
proposed CRC and the EU carbon market, the world’s biggest
greenhouse-gas program by traded volume. CRC is meant to
encourage emission cuts among companies and government units
that aren’t regulated by the EU.  To contact the reporter on this story:
