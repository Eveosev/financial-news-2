Metallurgical coal prices on the
U.S. spot market increased as producers capitalize on export
demand for the steelmaking ingredient, Energy Publishing Inc.
said.  Spot prices for low-volatility coking coal rose $11.67, or
3.8 percent, to $320 a ton in the week ended today, according to
the  Knoxville, Tennessee-based  data provider. High-volatility
coal added $10, or 3.8 percent, to $270.  U.S. producers are looking to benefit from customer
resistance in  Europe  and  Asia  to BHP Billiton Ltd.’s transition
to monthly prices, Energy Publishing said.  UBS AG said Feb. 21 that BHP Billiton, the world’s largest
mining company, may offer discounted prices for its
metallurgical coal to Japanese steelmakers as it seeks to
transition to monthly contracts from quarterly.  Energy Publishing says it surveys buyers and sellers of
coal to determine pricing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
