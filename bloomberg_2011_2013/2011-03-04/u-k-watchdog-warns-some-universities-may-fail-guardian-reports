Britain’s National Audit Office
believes the government’s decision to raise maximum tuition fees
universities are allowed to charge from 3,335 pounds ($5,430) to
9,000 pounds a year means there’s a greater risk that some
institutions will go bankrupt, the Guardian reported.   The planned financial framework for the universities, in
which state funding will be cut, “is likely to increase the
level of risk,” the newspaper cited the public-spending
watchdog as saying in a report to be published today.       The audit office says the means employed to detect
universities at high risk of financial failure are inadequate,
according to the newspaper.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
