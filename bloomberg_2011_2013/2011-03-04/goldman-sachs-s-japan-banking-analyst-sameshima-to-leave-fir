  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s Tokyo-
based analyst Toyoki Sameshima is leaving the firm after
halting coverage of Japanese banks including  Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. (8306)   Philippa Rogers, also based in the capital city, took
over coverage of the industry on Feb. 22, Goldman Sachs said
in a memo sent to clients and obtained by Bloomberg News.
Hiroko Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman at the bank,
confirmed the memo’s contents and declined to comment on when
Sameshima will finish working or the reason for leaving.  Sameshima’s departure follows finance industry position
shifts including Credit Suisse Group AG’s former Japan
equities head Kyoya Okazawa moving to BNP Paribas SA, as 2010
bonuses settle and the new year begins. Sameshima joined
Goldman Sachs in 2008 and previously held a bank analyst post
at Morgan Stanley. He was unavailable for comment.  Okazawa resigned as managing director at Credit Suisse
late last year and will start at  BNP Paribas (BNP)  in Tokyo as
early as next week, two people with knowledge of the matter
said this week.  UBS Global Asset Management (Japan) Ltd., the asset-
management unit of  Switzerland ’s biggest bank, hired Yasuhiko Takeji from BlackRock Inc. to head investment operations in
Tokyo, Susumu Okamura, the unit’s president, said in an
interview on March 1.  Goldman Sachs hired former Bank of Japan official
Naohiko Baba as its chief economist for the country in
January.  To contact the reporters on this story:
