Latvia’s current-account, a measure
of funds flowing into and out of a country, recorded a deficit
for the first time in two years in the fourth quarter as
writedowns at foreign banks slowed, the central bank said.  The shortfall totaled 11.3 million lati ($7.3 million), or
0.3 percent of gross domestic product, in the final three months
of last year, the Riga-based  central bank  said in an e-mailed
statement today. For 2010, the current account had a surplus of
3.6 percent of GDP, according to the statement.  The Baltic nation’s current account, which reached a
deficit of 27.1 percent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2006,
swung into a surplus as the country’s economic crisis led to
loan losses for foreign banks and unemployment led to a collapse
in imports. Latvia’s economy, which contracted 18 percent in
2009, expanded 3.7 percent in the fourth quarter, the quickest
pace in almost three years.  “Overall, a small surplus of the current account could be
retained in 2011, mainly as a result of current transfers,”
said central bank spokesman Martins Gravitis in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
