U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne , who’s implementing the country’s biggest fiscal
squeeze since World War II, will pledge to create low-tax
“enterprise zones” to boost the country’s growth, a government
official said.  The country’s economy unexpectedly contracted in the final
quarter of 2010, and government spending cuts will take effect
from April. Osborne, who addresses his  Conservative Party ’s
conference tomorrow in Cardiff, Wales, will use his speech to
set out some of the results of the government’s growth review,
said the U.K. official, who spoke on the condition of not
being identified.  The zones, at least 10 of which will be set up across the
country, will also offer simplified planning procedures. The
government will invest 100 million pounds ($163 million) in the
areas by 2015, according to the official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
