  Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) , the
maker of processors for the BlackBerry phone, fell 11 percent in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading after predicting sales for its
current quarter that fell short of analysts’ estimates.  Revenue for the quarter ending in April will be $800
million to $850 million, said Clyde Hosein, the  Santa Clara ,
California-based company’s chief financial officer, on a
conference call yesterday. Analysts had estimated $882.5
million, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Marvell, which also makes chips that control computer hard-
disk drives, suffered from eroding demand in the PC market,
Chief Executive Officer Sehat Sutardja told analysts on the
call. He said he expects that trend to continue.  Demand for tablet computers such as  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad is
cutting into laptop sales and orders for components such as hard
disk drives, said Gartner Inc., a Stamford, Connecticut-based
research firm. Tablets use flash-memory chips, rather than disk
drives, for storage.  Marvell shares fell $2.09 to $16.13 at 4 p.m. New York
time, the biggest one-day decline since August 2007. The stock
has dropped 13 percent this year.  The company reported net income of $222.8 million, or 33
cents a share, for the three months ended Jan. 29, compared with
$204.8 million, or 31 cents, in the same period a year earlier.
Sales rose to $901 million from $842.5 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
