Green Ventures , a developer of
hydropower plants in Nepal, plans to commission 1,000 megawatts
of capacity in the South Asian nation by 2016.  The Mumbai-based companyâ€™s joint venture partner LNJ
Bhilwara Group has started construction on a 120-megawatt plant
on the Likhu River, which will export electricity to  India  when
completed, Chief Executive Officer Krish R. Krishnan said today
in an interview in Mumbai.  Green Ventures has acquired the rights to develop eight
other sites in Nepal that have an estimated potential to produce
an additional 2,000 megawatts of power, he said. Engineering
studies are completed for about 600 megawatts of capacity at two
of those sites, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
