Neue Zuercher Bank AG, a Swiss
company partly owned by  Bank Sarasin & Cie AG (BSAN) , said it plans to
close its main brokerage business because cross-border banking
with the U.S. has become “more difficult.”  Staff working at the brokerage unit will join MainFirst
Schweiz AG, the Zurich-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Hansruedi Schumacher, a Neue Zuercher Bank manager who once
ran the cross-border business for UBS AG, was indicted in August
2009 in the U.S. on charges of helping Americans evade taxes on
accounts at both banks. He was fired by Neue Zuercher Bank and
in December 2009 declared a fugitive in the U.S.  Neue Zuercher Bank was founded in 2000 and is 40 percent
owned by Bank Sarasin. It has been focusing on brokerage
business with institutional investors in  Switzerland  and abroad
and has 30 employees, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
