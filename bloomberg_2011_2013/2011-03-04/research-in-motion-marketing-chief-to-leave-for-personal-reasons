  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM) , the maker
of the BlackBerry, said its chief marketing officer will leave
the company for personal reasons.  Keith Pardy will stay on with RIM for six months to assist
with the transition, Tenille Kennedy, a spokeswoman, said today
in an e-mailed statement. She didn’t say who would replace
Pardy, who spent 17 years with  Coca-Cola Co. (KO)  and worked for
Nokia Oyj before joining RIM in 2009.  RIM fell $1.98, or 2.9 percent, to $66.47 in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading at 4 p.m. New York time. The Waterloo, Ontario-
based company has risen 14 percent this year.  The Wall Street Journal reported Pardy’s decision earlier
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
