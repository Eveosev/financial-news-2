Premier League soccer team West Ham
United’s fiscal-year loss widened because of costs related to
firing its former manager and a lower league position last
season.  Parent company, WH Holdings Ltd., had a net loss of 20.6
million pounds ($33.5 million) for the year ended May 31,
according to a filing published by  Companies House . Sales year
declined 6 percent to 71.7 million pounds. The team has 90.2
million pounds in accumulated losses in the past five years.  West Ham  was taken over by  David Gold  and  David Sullivan  in
January 2010. The east London-based club avoided relegation from
the Premier League last season by one place. That cut its
performance payments from the league by 6.4 million pounds from
the previous season, when it finished 9th.  It fired  Gianfranco Zola  and his coaching team and hired  Avram Grant . Costs associated with terminating those contracts
were 3.4 million pounds. Under Grant, the Hammers are in the
relegation zone, 19th out of 20 teams after 28 matches.  “In the event that we are relegated at the end of the
season, contingency plans are already in place and we will act
decisively to give the club the best possible chance of
returning to the Premier League at the first attempt,” chairman
Sullivan said in a statement in the accounts. “The club is
financially secure regardless of its league status.”  Salary Ratio Cut  Gold and Sullivan have tried to stem costs. Wages fell by
9.7 million pounds, bringing the ratio of salaries to revenue to
70 percent from 79 percent. European soccer’s governing body, 
UEFA , says a 70 percent ratio is the maximum a club should
spend. Operating expenses fell 16 percent to 75.1 million
pounds.  The owners last year expended 24 million pounds on the
team, using half to pay down borrowings. Net debt declined 40
percent to 33.5 million pounds. A 26.5 million pound loan that
had matured has been refinanced until the end of 2013.  Gold and Sullivan now own about 60 percent of the team
after buying a 50 percent stake in 2010 with Iceland’s Straumur-
Burdaras Investment Bank hf. The bank took over in June 2009
after former owner Bjorgulfur Gudmundsson was unable to pay
creditors. Efforts to sell a 40 percent stake in the team for 40
million pounds have failed. The Telegraph yesterday reported
Gold and Sullivan are now looking to increase their stake to 82
percent.  The U.K. government yesterday backed West Ham’s selection
as anchor tenant for  London ’s Olympic Stadium after the 2012
Games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
