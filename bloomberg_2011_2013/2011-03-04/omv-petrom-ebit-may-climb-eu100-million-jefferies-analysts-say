  OMV Petrom SA (SNP) ,  Romania ’s biggest oil
company, may increase earnings before interest and taxes as much
as 100 million euros ($140 million) after its Brazi gas-fired
power plant starts operating, according to analysts at Jefferies
& Co. Inc.  “Approximately 20 percent of Petrom’s equity gas
production in Romania will be redirected to the Brazi power
plant and we estimate the project could add 100 million euros
EBIT net to Petrom once up and running,” the analysts, led by
Daniel Ekstein in  London , wrote in a note to customers today.  Petrom plans to develop a power-generation portfolio with
the 860-megawatt Brazi plant and a wind park in the southern
Dobrogea area to be connected to the national  power grid  this
year. The company wants to build a 10 percent share of Romania’s
electricity market.  Petrom will probably start selling electricity produced at
the Brazi plant in the second half of this year, Chief Executive
Officer Mariana Gheorghe said on Feb. 23.  “The project should generate quite high returns, as it is
an effective way of arbitraging the difference in liberalised
Romanian power prices and regulated domestic gas prices that are
kept artificially low by the government,” the Jefferies
analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
