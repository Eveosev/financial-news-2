Centum Investment Co., East Africa’s
biggest publicly traded investment company, gained for the first
day in six as its relative strength index dropped below a level
that indicates prices are set to rise.  The stock advanced as much as 3.5 percent to 22.25
shillings before paring its gain and trading 1.2 percent higher
at 21.75 shillings by the 3:00 p.m. close in Nairobi. The
shares, declined 3.4 percent in the five trading days through
yesterday, when Centum’s RSI fell to 23.67. A reading of 30 or
below signals prices are set to increase.  “There is bargain-hunting from investors right now,” George Bodo, an analyst with Nairobi-based Genghis Capital Ltd., said
in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
