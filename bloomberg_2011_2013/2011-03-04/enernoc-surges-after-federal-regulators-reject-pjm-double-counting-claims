  EnerNOC Inc. (ENOC) , an electricity demand-
reduction service, jumped after the  Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission  said it wonâ€™t pursue penalties against such service
providers that PJM Interconnection LLC said have double-counted
some reductions.      Boston-based EnerNOC rose $3.12, or 16 percent, to $22.23
at 2:39 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Before today, the
shares had dropped 21 percent since Feb. 4, when PJM and its
market monitor sent a complaint to federal regulators.  EnerNOC aggregates electricity consumption by multiple
companies, which receive lower power rates in exchange for
allowing their service to be cut at times of high demand.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
