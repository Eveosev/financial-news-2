South African bonds fell for a
second day as  oil prices  above $100 a barrel stoked inflation
concern and the prospect for interest-rate increases by the
European Central Bank cut the yield allure of the nation’s debt.  The 6.75 percent bond due March 2021 fell 20 cents to 86.59
rand, raising the yield by three basis points to 8.79 percent as
of 11:10 a.m. in Johannesburg.  South Africa ’s 13.5 percent bond
due September 2015 fell 15 cents to 121.31 rand, lifting the
yield by three basis points to 7.81 percent.  Crude for April delivery rose as high as $103.03 a barrel
in  New York , headed for a third weekly gain, as unrest in Libya
renewed concerns that supplies will be disrupted.  European
Central Bank  President Jean-Claude Trichet said yesterday that
the bank may lift rates from a record-low 1 percent next month
as “strong vigilance” is needed as inflation risks worsen.  “Inflation looks like it’s going to ratchet up faster than
everyone anticipated because of rising food and fuel prices,”
Ian Cruickshanks, head of research at Nedbank Treasury in
Johannesburg, said by telephone. “With ECB rate hikes coming,
the rate differential offered by South Africa is likely to be
eroded and with it the source of funding that the local  bond
market  has enjoyed over the past year.”  South African bonds rallied last year as net foreign
purchases of local-currency debt surged to 61 billion rand ($8.8
billion) from 26.5 billion rand in 2009, according to the  JSE
Ltd. (JSE) , which operates South Africa’s exchanges. The gains came as
developed-market  interest rates , near zero percent, encouraged
investors to seek higher-yielding alternatives in markets such
as South Africa, where the benchmark rate is 5.5 percent, even
after nine reductions since December 2008.  The rand appreciated as much as 0.4 percent to 6.8810 per
dollar before trading 0.1 percent stronger at 6.8998. Against
the euro, the rand added less than 0.1 percent to 9.6294.  To contact the reporter on this story:
