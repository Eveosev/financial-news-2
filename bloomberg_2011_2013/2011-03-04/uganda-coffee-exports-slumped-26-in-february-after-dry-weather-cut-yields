Coffee exports from Uganda,  Africa ’s
second-biggest grower of the crop, fell 26 percent in February
after a dry spell cut yields, the Uganda Coffee Development
Authority said.  Shipments declined to 193,965 60-kilogram (132-pound) bags
from 262,793 bags a year earlier, the agency said today in a
draft report, details of which were provided to Bloomberg News
by phone from the capital, Kampala. Exports surpassed an earlier
forecast of 185,000 bags, though they were lower than the
215,180 bags shipped in January, the authority said.  Shipments in the 12 months through September may climb 16
percent to 3.1 million bags because of an anticipated
improvement in weather and yields from new tree plantings, the
agency said on Sept. 20.  Exports from the start of the season on Oct. 1 through
February declined 7.6 percent to 1.1 million bags, according to
a tally of UCDA figures by Bloomberg News.    Uganda  is Africa’s second-biggest producer of coffee after  Ethiopia . Robusta accounts for about 85 percent of annual
output. The country earned $243.6 million from the beans last
season, compared with $291.3 million a year earlier.  The East African nation, whose yields declined from 4.4
million bags in 1996-97 partly because of crop damage by the
coffee wilt disease, plans to increase production to 4.5 million
a season by 2015 through an ongoing replanting program,
according to the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
