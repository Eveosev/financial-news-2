Commodities jumped to the highest in
more than two years, led by gains in agriculture as cotton
increased to a record amid dwindling stockpiles and cocoa
advanced to a 32-year high on political unrest in  Ivory Coast .  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Total Return Index of 24
commodities reached 5,489.5 points, the highest level since
November 2008. Cotton gained the maximum allowed on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York, and cocoa touched the highest since 1979.
Cotton and corn prices “appear to have the most upside,”
Rabobank International said.  “Export commitments out of the U.S. continue at record
pace and due to the razor-thin expected ending stocks, demand
must be rationed as there is not enough cotton,” the bank said
in a report yesterday. “The need to ration demand in a
marketplace where mills have demonstrated a willingness to buy
high-price fiber will keep values elevated and limit
corrections.”  Cotton futures for May delivery gained the maximum allowed
7 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $2.127 a pound in  New York  at 10:28
a.m. London time. The price will average $1.65 a pound in the
second quarter, Rabobank said in the report. Wheat futures for
May delivery gained 9.5 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $8.33 a bushel
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. Corn and soybean futures both
rose 0.2 percent in Chicago.  “While the U.S. cotton planting season is still a month
away, the current dry conditions in the South and strong La Nina
suggest that soil moisture deficiencies could be an issue,” the
bank said.  Cocoa for May delivery rose $17, or 0.5 percent, to $3,750
a metric ton in New York. The price earlier touched $3,775 a
ton, the highest since January 1979.  Turmoil Spurs Gold  Gold is poised for a fifth weekly gain, its longest such
run since October, as turmoil in North Africa and the Middle
East boost demand for the metal as a haven for investors.  Immediate-delivery bullion rose $2.46 an ounce, or 0.2
percent, to $1,418.46 an ounce in  London . The metal gained to an
all-time high of $1,440.32 on March 2. The contract for April
delivery climbed $2.30, or 0.2 percent, to $1,418.70 an ounce.  As oil has climbed above $100 a barrel in New York,
mounting inflation pressures in  Europe  prompted European Central
Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  yesterday to say the ECB may
raise rates next month for the first time in almost three years.  Oil rose on speculation political unrest in  Libya  will
disrupt supply as economic data from the U.S. shows signs of
increasing demand. Brent oil for April delivery rose as much as
1.2 percent to $116.20 a barrel earlier today. Crude oil rose as
much as 1.1 percent to $103.03 a barrel in New York.  Libyan opposition leaders rejected a mediation offer by
Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez , an ally of  Muammar Qaddafi ,
and armed rebels held out against regime attacks and prepared to
push toward the capital, Tripoli. A government report today may
show payroll gains in the U.S. accelerated in February, spurred
on by an improving economy and more seasonable temperatures,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
