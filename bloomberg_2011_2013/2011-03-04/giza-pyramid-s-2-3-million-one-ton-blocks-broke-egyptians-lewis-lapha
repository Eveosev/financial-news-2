Sole survivor of the seven ancient
wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza stands 481 feet
high. For 44 centuries it was the tallest building in the world
and the ultimate symbol of absolute power.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Covering 13 acres, the pyramid consists of 2.3 million
stone blocks each weighing more than a ton.  Limestone dust and swarms of flies tortured the sweaty
conscripts laboring in the blazing quarry. The blocks had to be
put on wooden sledges and then pulled by ropes until they could
be moved into position at the rate of one every two minutes over
a 10-hour day.  To get the job done, teams of 20 men were organized into
larger and larger divisions, ending with 2,000-member crews.
Skeletons show broken bones, back pain and arthritic disease.  Uniting heaven and earth in  service  to the divine king, the
pyramid embodied the idea of untrammeled authority. So deeply
did this belief enter the fabric of life there, the recent
uprising is the first time in history that Egyptian people have
collectively expressed their own voice.  I spoke with Toby Wilkinson, author of “The Rise and Fall
of Ancient Egypt,” on the following topics:  1. The Importance of the Army  2. Ramesses II  3. Dissent Repressed  4. Opulence vs. Penury  5. Too Slow to Respond  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  (Lewis Lapham is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
