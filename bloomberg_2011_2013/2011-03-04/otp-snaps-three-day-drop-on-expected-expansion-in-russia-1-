OTP Bank Nyrt. gained for the first
time in four days after  Hungary ’s largest lender said it expects
growth in  consumer lending  in Russia and Ukraine and earned more
money providing loans.  The stock rose as much as 2.3 percent and traded 1.4
percent higher at 5,635 forint as of 10:05 a.m. in Budapest,
paring its loss so far this week to 1.8 percent.  The bank’s Russian and Ukrainian units posted results "well
above expectations," and loan growth will be driven by “more
significant” expansion in those markets, the lender said.  OTP, which has subsidiaries in nine countries, said fourth-
quarter net income fell 15 percent, missing analyst estimates,
even as revenue increased 1 percent. Net interest income, the
difference between what the lender pays on deposits and charges
for loans, rose 2 percent in the period, and OTP reduced cash
set aside for bad loans by 12 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
