  WPP Plc (WPP) , the world’s largest
advertising company, said profit last year increased as ad
markets rebounded, led by a recovery in the U.S.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose 16 percent to 1.44 billion pounds ($2.34
billion), the London-based company said in a statement today.
Sales gained 7.4 percent to 9.33 billion pounds, a smaller jump
than the 20 percent reported by rival Publicis Group SA. WPP
declined as much 3.2 percent in  London  trading.  “The shares of WPP had been up because Publicis reported
such good results last month,” said Alexander Wisch, an analyst
at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research in London.  Like-for-like revenue was more than 8 percent higher in
January, and is budgeted to rise about 5 percent for the whole
of 2011, said Chief Executive Officer  Martin Sorrell . WPP, whose
businesses include Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide and the Hill &
Knowlton public relations firm, said the “relatively strong
performance of mature markets surprised the company and the U.S.
“behaved more like a fast-growing” market last year.  WPP shares slipped as much as 26.5 pence to 810 pence, the
biggest intraday drop since Aug. 24. The stock traded at 814.5
pence as of 11:01 a.m. in London.  Analysts in a Bloomberg survey had predicted Ebitda of 1.4
billion pounds on sales of 9.23 billion pounds.  Emerging Markets  “2010 was a year of significant recovery, as clients re-
focused on top-line sales growth and expansion, particularly in
fast-growth geographic markets, as well as continued cost
containment in the slower-growth markets of the  United States 
and Western Europe,” Sorrell said.  Publicis, owner of the Leo Burnett ad agency, said last
month its 2010 net income rose 31 percent on revenue from  North
America  and emerging markets.  WPP raised its target for revenue from “new markets and
new media” to 35 percent to 40 percent for each segment, from
one-third. There’s no timeframe to reach those targets, Sorrell
said in an interview today.  The company booked 3 billion pounds of new billings in
2010, for a total of 42.7 billion pounds. WPP agencies focused
on advertising and media investment management, which account
for 40 percent of sales, benefitted the most.  The company said the total dividend for the year will be
17.79 pence, an increase of 15 percent from 2009.  Some clients still have concerns over “Eurozone
contagion,” the U.S. deficit reduction and recent protests in
some Middle Eastern countries, Sorrell said.  WPP will continue to make small and medium-sized
acquisitions in fast-growing economies and new media, Sorrell
said in the interview.  Advertising should get a boost in 2012 with the  U.S.
presidential election , London Olympics and UEFA European
Football Championships adding 1 percent to 2 percent to global
ad and marketing growth rates, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
