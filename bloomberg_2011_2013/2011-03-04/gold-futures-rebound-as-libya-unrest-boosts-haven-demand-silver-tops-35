Gold rose as mounting tensions in  Libya  boosted the appeal of the precious metal as an investment
haven. Silver toped $35 an ounce, extending a rally to the
highest in 31 years.  Libyan opposition leaders rejected a mediation offer by
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez as armed rebels fought for
control of crude-oil ports on the central and eastern coastal
strip. Gold climbed for the sixth straight week, the longest
rally since September 2007. On March 2, the metal reached a
record of $1,441 an ounce.  “There are still a lot of moving parts in the Middle East
and North Africa,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior strategist
at Lind-Waldock in  Chicago . “People want to be long gold and
silver going into a weekend where’s there’s a lot of macro risk
in the market.”  Gold futures for April delivery rose $12.20, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $1,428.60 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York . The metal rose 1.4 percent this week.  Silver futures for May delivery jumped $1, or 2.9 percent,
to $35.327. Earlier, the price reached $35.405, the highest
since March 1980. In that year, the metal reached a record
$50.35.  This week, silver gained 7.3 percent, the sixth straight
increase. That marked the longest rally since March 2008.  Increasing food prices contributed to unrest that toppled
leaders in Tunisia and Egypt, and protests erupted in Yemen,
Bahrain, Oman, Algeria,  Iran  and Iraq. Gold slumped 6.1 percent
in January and has climbed 7.1 percent since then.  ‘Reverse Their View’  “People who were bearish on gold have really had to
reverse their view given all of the activity in the Middle East
and Northern Africa,” said William Rhind, the head of U.S.
sales and marketing at ETF Securities in New York.  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said
yesterday that borrowing costs may rise next month for the first
time in almost three years. Crude oil has topped $100 a barrel,
and global food costs climbed to a record last month, according
to a United Nations index.  “Being long gold is hedging against the inflationary
implications of higher  oil prices ,” said  Frank Lesh , a trader
at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago.  Palladium futures for June delivery fell $5, or 0.6
percent, to $809.80 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The price, up 2.8 percent this week, has jumped 75
percent in the past 12 months.  Platinum futures for April delivery rose $4.90, or 0.3
percent, to $1,837.90 an ounce. The metal, up 1.9 percent this
week, has climbed 16 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
