A bomb exploded near the car of
Madagascar’s President  Andry Rajoelina  late yesterday, said
Lucien Rakotoarimasy, the country’s defense minister.  Rajoelina was unhurt and the cars in the president’s
motorcade weren’t damaged, Rakotoarimasy said yesterday by phone
from Antananarivo, the capital. The home-made bomb was detonated
at the roadside, using a 200 meter-long (656 feet) wire, he
said.  “They put a time-bomb on the route the president takes
home from the palace,” Alain Ramaroson, head of the Cabinet’s
defense commission, said by phone. “They knew his schedule and
took advantage of a section of the road where cars are forced to
slow down.”  Political parties in the Indian Ocean island nation have
been in dispute since March 2009, when Rajoelina, a 36-year-old
former Antananarivo mayor, ousted  Marc Ravalomanana  with the
help of the military. The three main opposition groups rejected
a proposal from Southern African Development Community mediators
that Rajoelina stay as head of a transitional administration
until elections that should be held by November.  There were no independent witness reports on the explosion
and the motorcade immediately left the scene, Rakotoarimasy
said.  Madagascar, with a $9 billion economy, is the world’s
largest vanilla grower, while oil, nickel and titanium products
have also attracted investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
