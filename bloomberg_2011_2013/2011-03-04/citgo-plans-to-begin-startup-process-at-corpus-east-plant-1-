Citgo Petroleum Corp. is preparing
to restart an alkylation unit and a fluid catalytic cracker at
its Corpus Christi East plant in  Texas  following maintenance,
according to an advisory from a local agency.  “Citgo East Plant will begin the inventory and startup
process of the alky and 2 cat cracker units today and through
the weekend as the turnaround is completed and some occasional
flaring may occur,” according to the advisory from the Corpus
Christi-Nueces County emergency planning committee at 8:13 a.m.
local time.  Citgo shut the fluid catalytic cracking unit Feb. 7 to
repair an expansion joint, the Houston-based company said in a
state regulatory filing in February.  Outages can increase prices for refined products as
companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil as less feedstock is used.  The Corpus Christi facility, made up of East and West
plants, has a capacity of 165,000 barrels a day, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Citgo is owned by Petroleos de  Venezuela  SA, Venezuela’s state-run oil company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
