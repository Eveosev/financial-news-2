Fitch Ratings said it has revised  Spain ’s rating outlook to negative from stable and affirmed its
long-term foreign and local currency issuer default ratings at
‘AA+’.  Fitch said the negative outlook reflects its judgement
regarding the balance of risks around the strength and
sustainability of economic recovery, the ultimate fiscal cost of
the restructuring of the savings banks and the adherence to
budgetary targets.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
