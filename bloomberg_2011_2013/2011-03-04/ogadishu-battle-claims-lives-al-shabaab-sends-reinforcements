Fighting between Islamic militants
and Somali troops backed by African Union soldiers left
casualties among civilians and combatants in south Mogadishu
today.  The battle broke out after the al-Shabaab militia attacked
government and African Union troops, who then shelled rebel
controlled areas, Captain Hassan Mohamed, a police officer, told
Bloomberg by phone. He said “several” militia members had
died.  More than 50 African Union peacekeepers have been killed in
Mogadishu since the government started an offensive against the
militias two weeks ago,  Associated Press  reported, citing two
unidentified officials. There are about 8,000 Africa Union
troops in the country, almost all from Uganda and Burundi.  Al-Shabaab fighters received reinforcements today from the
southwestern city of Baidoa.  “I have seen several big trucks carrying uniformed al-
Shabaab troops passing this noon,” Fadumo Ahmed Abubakar, a
shopkeeper in Eelasha Biyaha, 17 kilometers (10.6 miles) from
Mogadishu, said by phone. “They were chanting ‘God is Great.’”  Somalia hasn’t had a functioning central administration
since the ouster of former dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
