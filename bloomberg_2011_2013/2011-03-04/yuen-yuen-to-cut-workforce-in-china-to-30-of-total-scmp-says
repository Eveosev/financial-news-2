  Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd. (551) 
plans to cut the percentage of its workforce in China to about
30 percent in the next few years from about 50 percent now by
expanding elsewhere, the  South China Morning Post  said, citing
Chairman Tsai Chi Neng.  The shoemaker, which employes 340,000 people worldwide,
plans to add factories in Cambodia and Bangladesh and expand
plants in Indonesia and Vietnam, the Hong Kong-based English-
language newspaper said today. Rising rages are part of the
reason for the shift, the Post said, citing Executive Director
David Tsai.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
