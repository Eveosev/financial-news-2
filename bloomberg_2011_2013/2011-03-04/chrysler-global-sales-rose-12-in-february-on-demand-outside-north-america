Chrysler Group LLC, the U.S.
automaker run by  Fiat SpA (F) , said its global sales in February
rose 12 percent from a year earlier with the rate of growth
outside  North America  quickening from January.  Deliveries climbed to 128,321 vehicles last month, Auburn
Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler said in an e-mail. Global sales
this year through February rose 14 percent to 229,787, below the
32 percent growth rate that Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  has targeted for this year.  Chrysler’s new vehicles and refreshed models haven’t had a
chance yet to fuel new sales growth, Dennis Virag, president of
Automotive Consulting Group in Ann Arbor, Michigan, said today
in a telephone interview. He said he’s skeptical that the
current lineup will be able to meet Chrysler’s sales goals.  “On the product side, they still need quite a bit of
work,” he said. While Chrysler doesn’t have a product portfolio
likely to drive “significant” gains, “they’ve done a good job
in basically refining the products they already had in the
market.”  Sales outside of the U.S.,  Canada  and Mexico rose
8.6 percent to 11,305 compared with a year ago, said Ralph Kisiel, a Chrysler spokesman. Non-North American sales in
January rose by 1.3 percent.  Sales from the Asia-Pacific region rose 51 percent to 3,648
in February, and deliveries in Western and Central Europe fell
33 percent to 2,083, Kisiel said yesterday.  Latin America  Latin America sales rose 12 percent to 3,355 in February
and deliveries in Chrysler’s sales region that includes  Africa ,
the Middle East, Eastern Europe and  Russia  rose 17 percent to
2,210, he said.  The company previously reported U.S. sales rose 13 percent
to 95,102 in February.  Chrysler’s second-largest sales market is Canada, where
sales climbed 8.5 percent to 15,238 in February.  Mexico  sales
last month rose to 6,676 from 6,013, the company said.  Marchionne, who is also CEO of Fiat, has said Chrysler will
sell 2 million vehicles this year, 32 percent more than the
1.52 million the automaker sold in 2010. The automaker is trying
to boost international sales and become profitable as it
prepares for an initial public offering in the second half of
the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
