Downtown Records celebrates its
talent roster with a schizophrenically savvy night at Webster
Hall.  There’s something for everyone -- the dizzy, hip-hop beats
of DJ-cum-producer wunderkind A-Trak, eccentric rock brats Art
Brut, oddball Austinites White Denim.  You’ll also hear model turned direly serious punkstar
Lissie Trullie and Japanese girl-on-girl group, The Suzan.  It’s a whirlwind that could wear out your Chucks.  125 E. 11th St. Information: +1-212-353-1600;

“Lucia di Lammermoor” at the  Metropolitan Opera .  As you may remember, Lucia goes off her nut in the Scottish
dampness after being forced to marry the wimpy second tenor. She
wanted the star tenor.  The result is one of the best mad scenes in the business,
and Dessay sings it with eerie perfection while scampering all
over the ugly set in a blood-soaked nightie.  Joseph Calleja makes the last scene worth hanging around
for.  At the Metropolitan Opera, Lincoln Center, until March 19.

Show,” where some 70 high-end dealers hawk their wares.  From Acquavella Galleries to  David Zwirner , you’ll see
everything from museum-quality 19th century work to barely dry
paintings fresh from the studio.  Park Ave. at 66th St. Information: +1-212-488-5550;
 http://www.artdealers.org/artshow.html   Then head over to Piers 92 and 94 for the confusingly named
“Armory Show,” where more than 300 international galleries
present modern and contemporary work.  Latin America is this year’s “Armory Focus,” with  Argentina ,  Brazil ,  Chile ,  Colombia ,  Mexico ,  Peru  and  Venezuela 
represented.  12th Ave. at 55th St. Information: +1-212-645-6440;
 http://www.thearmoryshow.com/cgi-local/content.cgi .  Neue Galerie  For a more intimate experience, check out the erotic
drawings of Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt, part of the Neue
Galerie’s “Vienna 1900: Style and Identity.”  Wander through elegant rooms filled with luscious
paintings, posters, furniture, decorative objects and a few
splendid garments.  How could Viennese women eat Sachertorte with whipped cream
and somehow cinch themselves into those micro-corsets?  Be sure to take a close look at Max Oppenheimer’s 1909
portrait of  Sigmund Freud , and then lie down and free associate
on the good doctor’s couch.  On your way out, stop by the Cafe Sabarsky for some torte
of your own.  1048 Fifth Ave. Information: +1-212-628-6200;

“How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.”  He starts out as a window-washer who follows a self-help
book, here voiced by Anderson Cooper, to reach the top. (Walter Cronkite did it for the 1995 revival.)  Veteran funnyman John Larroquette is the big boss, and Rose
Hemingway the love interest.  Radcliffe’s final outing as the boy wizard in   Harry
Potter  and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2” comes out in July.  In previews at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre, 246 W. 44th St.,
opening March 27. Information: +1-877-686-5366;

orchestra at age 19, and by 21 he was conducting the Berlin
Philharmonic. He’s since gone on to appear in all the great
concert halls and opera houses in  Europe .  Now 35, Harding makes his New York Philharmonic debut with
Mahler’s Fourth Symphony and Szymanowski’s Violin Concerto No.

St. and Kazimiroff Boulevard, Bronx. Information: +1-718-817-

acrobats who tumble, dance, jump and engage one another in
complex, fast-paced and sexy ways.  One routine features a woman in red stilettos walking and
balancing on her male partner.  It’s a brainy circus for the 21st century, with cutting-
edge projections and a soundtrack featuring Sigur Ros and
Leonard Cohen.  At NYU’s Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566
LaGuardia Place at Washington Square. Information: +1-212-352-
