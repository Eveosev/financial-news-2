  Romania  has eliminated as many as
9,000 public jobs since November, Prime Minister Emil Boc told
national television.  Boc added that the public sector workforce totaled 1.26
million at the end of February.  The government plans to continue job cuts this year to curb
spending and each sector should have as many workers as it
needs, Boc said late yesterday in an interview on  public
television station  TVR.  To contact the reporter on this story:
