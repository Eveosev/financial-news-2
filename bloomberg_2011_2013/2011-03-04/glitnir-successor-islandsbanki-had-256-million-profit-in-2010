Islandsbanki hf, the state-created
successor to failed Icelandic lender Glitnir Bank hf, reported a
profit in 2010.  The Reykjavik-based bank had net income of 29.4 billion
kronur ($256 million) last year, it said in a statement on its
website today. Net interest income was 34.9 billion kronur,
compared with 32 billion kronur in 2009, and operating income
was 56 billion kronur, up from 45 billion kronur a year earlier.  Islandsbanki was created after Glitnir collapsed in October
2008 after it was unable to secure short-term funding. A year
later, the unit was taken over by a resolution committee
representing the bankâ€™s creditors, which now hold 95 percent of
its shares. The Icelandic government retains a 5 percent stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
