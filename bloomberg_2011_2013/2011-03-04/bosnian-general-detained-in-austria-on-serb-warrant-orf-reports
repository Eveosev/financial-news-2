Austrian authorities detained a
Bosnian general at  Serbia ’s request, the state-run television
channel ORF reported.   Jovan Divjak was transiting through Vienna International
Airport on his way to a conference in Bologna,  Italy  when he was
apprehended, ORF said. He is sought for his alleged role in
ordering strikes on retreating Serbian soldiers in 1992, ORF
reported, citing Serbia’s Interior Ministry.   Serbia filed a request with Interpol in 2008 to detain
Divjak, ORF said. An Austrian judge will determine whether the
general will be extradited to Serbia, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
