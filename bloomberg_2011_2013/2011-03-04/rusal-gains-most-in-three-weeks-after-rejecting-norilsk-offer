United Co. Rusal, the world’s
largest aluminum producer, gained the most in three weeks in  Hong Kong  after rejecting OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel’s offer to buy
a stake it holds in the Russian nickel mining company.  Shares of Rusal rose 3.9 percent to HK$12.80 at the midday-
trading break in Hong Kong, its steepest gain since Feb. 14,
after jumping as much as 5.5 percent. That compares with the 1.2
percent gain for the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  “I don’t think the market had been really expecting them
to accept the offer so it probably wasn’t a real surprise, but
it looks like the market is viewing the news slightly
positively,” said Andrew Driscoll, the Hong Kong-based head of
resources research at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets. “Coupled with
the sentiment in the market, it’s leading to a good move in the
share price.”  Rusal rejected Norilsk’s offer to buy a $12.8 billion stake
in the company, saying it wouldn’t be in the best interests of
its shareholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
