Richards Bay Coal Terminal Ltd.,  Africa ’s largest export facility for the fuel, said shipments
fell 7.4 percent last month.  Shipments from the port on  South Africa ’s northeast coast
dropped to 4.57 million metric tons in February from 4.94
million tons a year earlier, RBCT said today on its  website ,
without giving a reason.  RBCT, whose owners include  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and  Anglo
American Plc (AAL) , said in January that first-quarter exports will be
affected by train derailments following heavy rains. The reduced
rail service forced coal suppliers to tap stockpiles, which
shrank to 1.7 million tons at the end of 2010 from 2.98 million
tons on Nov. 30.  Prices for coal traded through RBCT rose 22 percent to an
average $117.84 a ton in February from a month earlier,
according to IHS McCloskey data on Bloomberg. The port received
5.52 million tons during the month, and had stocks of 2.8
million tons, said RBCT, which has capacity to export 91 million
tons annually.  The freight rail unit of state-owned Transnet Ltd. aims to
deliver 68 million tons of coal to the port this year, up from
63 million tons last year, Mxolisi Mgojo, head of coal at mining
company  Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX) , said Feb. 24. Transnet Freight
Rail will comment later, Sandile Simelane, a spokesman for the
unit, said today by mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
