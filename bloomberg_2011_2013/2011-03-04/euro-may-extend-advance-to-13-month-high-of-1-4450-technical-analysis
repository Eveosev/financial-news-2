The euro may climb to the strongest
level in 13 months against the dollar if it closes above so-
called resistance at $1.40, according to BNP Paribas SA, citing
trading patterns.  At that level  Europe ’s single currency would have recouped
about 80 percent of its slide from $1.4282 on Nov. 4 to $1.2867
on Jan. 10, opening the way for a full retracement to the
November high, said  Andrew Chaveriat , a technical strategist at
the world’s biggest bank by assets. Fibonacci analysis also
suggests the euro may extend gains if it breaks through the
$1.40 resistance barrier, he said.  “One dollar forty is a critical level on the longer-term
charts so if you get above there you really reopen the highs
from November,” New York-based Chaveriat said in a telephone
interview. “If we get above $1.40 you have a good chance to go
toward the $1.43 to $1.4450 zone.”  The euro traded at $1.3961 as of 6:01 a.m. in  London  after
climbing to $1.3974 yesterday, the strongest since Nov. 8. The
common currency last traded at $1.4450 on Jan. 15, 2010, as it
headed toward a four-year low of 1.1877 on June 7.  The area above $1.43 includes a downtrend line from the
euro’s record high of $1.6038 in July 2008 as well as the 76.4
percent Fibonacci retracement of its decline between November
2009 and June 2010, Chaveriat said.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that securities
tend to rise or fall by specific percentages after reaching a
new high or low. Key percentages include 23.6, 38.2, 50, 61.8
and 76.4. A resistance level is an area where traders anticipate
sell orders to be clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
