  Ukraine  should refrain from curbing
access to grain exports, the Grain and Feed Trade Association
said after a draft law that would restrict cereal shipping was
earmarked for a parliamentary vote.  Gafta “is very concerned with recent developments in
Ukraine because they may lead to limiting the freedom of export
of grains from the country,” the Kiev office of the London-
based association said in a March 3  statement  on its website.  The measure would limit exports to grain producers, so-
called state agents appointed by the government and companies
making advance payments, a draft published on the parliamentary
website shows. Producers could ship only cereals they grew
themselves, and companies seeking to export would be required to
pay at least half the value of the grain they aimed to deliver.  The Ukrainian parliament’s agriculture committee approved
the draft on March 2 and recommended its passage in first
reading before the legislature. The country will export 5.5
million metric tons of wheat, an equal amount of corn and 4
million tons of barley in the current marketing year for each
crop, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates.  Gafta is an international trade association with more than
1,250 members from importers to banks in 86 nations, its  website 
shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
