Rabobank Group lifted its three-
month forecast for the euro, predicting the currency will
advance to $1.42, after European Central Bank President Jean-
Claude Trichet said the ECB may increase  interest rates .  The bank previously forecast that the 17-nation unit would
trade at $1.40, Jane Foley, a senior strategist in  London , said
in a telephone interview today. It maintained its prediction of
a gain to $1.52 in 12 months, she said.  “We weren’t expecting that degree of hawkishness,” Foley
said. “The pace of gains in euro-dollar has been significant
despite the fact that the European Monetary Union debt crisis
has been bubbling along.”  The European common currency traded at $1.3952 as of 8:31
a.m. in London, after appreciating yesterday to $1.3974,
matching the strongest level since Nov. 9. The euro has climbed
4.3 percent against the dollar since Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
