The Brazilian government may
announce on March 9 or 10 new measures to curb the real
appreciation, including another increase of the IOF tax and
stricter controls of foreign capital, IG reported, without
saying where it obtained the information.    Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  is studying possible
measures together with the country’s central bank, wrote
Guilherme Barros, a columnist at the Sao Paulo-based news
service’s website.   The central bank declined to comment in an e-mailed
statement. The  Finance Ministry  also declined to comment,
according to a spokesperson, who asked not to be named because
of internal policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
