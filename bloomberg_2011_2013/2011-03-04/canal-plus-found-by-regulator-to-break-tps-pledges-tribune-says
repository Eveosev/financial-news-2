  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s Canal Plus pay-
television unit didn’t live up to all commitments made to  France ’s antitrust regulator when it bought a rival in 2006,   La
Tribune  reported, citing a preliminary report by the regulator
that it said it has seen.  The authority is probing Canal Plus’s practices following
the purchase of competitor TPS, and is expected to publish the
report in the middle of this year, La Tribune said. According to
the preliminary report, Canal Plus delayed allowing Internet
providers access to some of its TPS channels, the channels
didn’t show as much sports and movies as Canal Plus had promised
as a condition of the acquisition, La Tribune said.  Voicemail messages seeking comment before business hours at
Paris-based Vivendi’s and  Canal Plus ’s press offices weren’t
immediately answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
