Foster + Partners’ design for West
Kowloon Cultural District, a harbor-front site in Hong Kong 
that will become an arts hub with 17 venues including an opera
house, was chosen by the city’s government.  City Park, the plan by  Norman Foster ’s London-based firm,
beat proposals by Hong Kong-based Rocco Design Architects Ltd.
and Rotterdam-based Office for Metropolitan Architecture,
according to a statement on the West Kowloon Cultural District
Authority’s  website  today. The project will cost about 21.6
billion Hong Kong dollars ($2.8 billion).  The development, on 40 hectares (99-acres) of reclaimed
land, also includes a 15,000-seat arena and a two-kilometer
(1.2-mile) promenade, as well as commercial and residential
buildings, the U.K. firm’s  website  shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
