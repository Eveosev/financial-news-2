The U.S. is tied 1-1 with Chile in
the first round of tennis’ Davis Cup World Group play, and
defending champion Serbia is tied 1-1 with  India .  Top-ranked American Andy Roddick defeated Nicolas Massu 6-
2, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the opening singles match of the best-of-
five round. John Isner followed with a 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (2-7), 7-6
(7-3), 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 loss to Paul Capdeville that took almost
four and a half hours and featured one break of service.  The U.S. is playing without  Sam Querrey , who injured the
rotator cuff in his right shoulder, the Washington Post
reported, citing U.S. captain Jim Courier.  The Davis Cup is the largest annual international men’s
tennis tournament. The United States has won a record 32 titles,
most recently in 2007. The team needs two more victories this
weekend to advance to the second round.  Serbia is playing without  Novak Djokovic , the world’s
third-ranked player and 2011 Australian Open winner. Djokovic
won two singles matches during the 2010 finals in December, when
Serbia rallied from a 2-1 deficit to beat France.  Spain, which won the tournament in 2008 and 2009, holds a
2-0 lead over Belgium behind straight-set victories from
Fernando Verdasco and Rafael Nadal. France is up 2-0 against
Austria. Sweden holds a 2-0 lead against Russia, Argentina is up
2-0 against Romania and  Germany  is tied 1-1 with Croatia.
Kazakhstan and the  Czech Republic  also are tied 1-1.  Play resumes tomorrow with doubles matches. Bob Bryan and
Mike Bryan, the world’s top-ranked doubles team, are scheduled
to represent the U.S. against  Chile ’s Massu and Jorge Aguilar,
according to the tournament website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
