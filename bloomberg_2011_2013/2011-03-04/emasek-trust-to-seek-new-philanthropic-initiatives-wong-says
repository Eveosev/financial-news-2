Jacqueline Wong, who was appointed
Temasek Trust’s chief executive officer, comments on her plan
for the philanthropic trust of Temasek Holdings Pte,  Singapore ’s
state-owned investment company. The company has contributed
S$800 million ($632 million) to the trust since it was set up in
2007.  Wong made the comments in response to an e-mailed query.  “Since our inception in 2007, the trust has grown in size,
scope and complexity. Going forward, the trust and its
beneficiaries will continue to engage in new and emerging
philanthropic initiatives in Singapore and across  Asia .  “As the trust grows, we will also expand the number of our
beneficiaries from the present five. One of my priorities is to
further build the capabilities that institutionalize the trust’s
role as a strong stakeholder and a responsible player and
enabler in philanthropy. These capabilities include processes,
systems, team and advisors.  “I will also be working with the trustees to shape the
institution as well as its strategic direction, mission,
platforms and initiatives. We will work together with our
beneficiaries to collectively maximize the social impact of the
trust’s initiatives.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
