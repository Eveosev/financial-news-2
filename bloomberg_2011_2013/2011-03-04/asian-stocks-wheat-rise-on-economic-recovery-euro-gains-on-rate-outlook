U.S. stocks slid, a day after the
biggest rally in three months, as oil rallied to a 29-month
high and government data showed American wage growth trailed
forecasts. European stocks erased earlier gains.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.7 percent to
1,321.15 at 4 p.m. in  New York , after climbing 1.7 percent
yesterday. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 0.6 percent. Crude
rose 2.5 percent to $104.42 a barrel and gold advanced 0.9
percent to $1,428.60 an ounce as commodity gauges advanced to
the highest levels since 2008. Treasuries and the Swiss franc
advanced on demand for haven assets.  U.S. equities wiped out most of a weekly gain as the surge
in oil fueled concern that  consumer spending  may slow,
underscored by Labor Department data showing average hourly
earnings were unchanged last month. Libya’s rebels clashed with
forces loyal to  Muammar Qaddafi  and President  Barack Obama  said
the U.S. military is ready to protect civilians in the conflict.  “I’m concerned about hourly earnings being flat,” said
Paul Zemsky, New York-based head of  asset allocation  for ING
Investment Management, which oversees $550 billion. “With
rising gas prices this means that consumers’ real income is not
increasing, which will put downward pressure on consumption. I
don’t think this is a good number for the equity market.”  Jobless Rate  Gasoline advanced to a 30-month high on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , climbing 0.7 percent to $3.0464 a gallon.  U.S. employers added 192,000 workers last month, following
a 63,000 increase in January and compared with the 196,000
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, Labor
Department figures showed. The jobless rate unexpectedly fell to
8.9 percent, defying the median prediction for an increase to
9.1 percent, according to a Bloomberg survey. Separate data from
the Commerce Department showed orders to U.S. factories climbed
3.1 percent in January, the most in more than four years.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. lost 2.1
percent and 3 percent, respectively, to help lead financial
shares to the biggest decline among 10 groups in the  S&P 500 
after Bank of America Corp. cut its ratings on both banks.
Marvell Technology Group Ltd. tumbled 11 percent as the maker of
processors for the BlackBerry phone forecast sales that missed
estimates.  Private payrolls have increased for 12 straight months
after plunging by as many as 841,000 jobs when President Obama
took office at the depths of the recession in January 2009,
Labor Department data show.  95% Rally  The recovery in the job market has helped propel a rebound
in the U.S. equity market after the collapse of the subprime
mortgage market triggered the worst  bear market  since the Great
Depression. The S&P 500 has rallied 95 percent from a 12-year
low in March 2009, the biggest advance over the same period of
time since 1930s, according to data compiled by  Howard Silverblatt , senior index analyst at S&P.  “The numbers point both to a much-needed improvement in
the jobs picture and to remaining challenges,” said Mohamed El- Erian, chief executive officer at Newport Beach, California-
based Pacific Investment Management Co. He cited declining labor
participation as a lingering concern. The labor participation
rate held at 64.2 percent, compared with January, and is down
from 64.8 percent in February 2010.  Stocks have also rallied as better-than-estimated data
bolstered speculation the  U.S. economy  can withstand higher
costs for energy. Reports this week showed claims for first-time
jobless benefits decreased, U.S. businesses grew at the fastest
pace in two decades and gauges of manufacturing and service
industries climbed to the highest levels since at least 2005.  Better-than-estimated data pushed the Citigroup Economic
Surprise Index to its highest level ever, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Franc, Treasuries  The franc gained against its 16 major counterparts,
climbing 0.7 percent to $1.0811 and rising 0.6 percent against
the euro. The 10-year Treasury yield slipped seven basis points
to 3.49 percent and the two-year yield lost eight basis points
to 0.69 percent.  Markets in  Asia  closed before the release of the U.S. jobs
data. The  MSCI AC Asia Pacific (MXAP)  Index rose 1.1 percent, with
Japan’s  Nikkei-225 (NKY)  Stock Average rallying 1 percent. The MSCI
Emerging Markets Index added 0.8 percent, extending this week’s
advance to 3.4 percent, its best performance for the period in
three months.  South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  climbed 1.7 percent.  China ’s
Shanghai Composite Index jumped 1.4 percent to a more than
three-month high before the country’s annual government congress
which starts tomorrow. Benchmark gauges in Indonesia, Malaysia
and the Philippines rose more than 1 percent.    Brent crude  climbed as much as 1.5 percent to $116.49 a
barrel in London. Jet fuel, diesel and gasoline have surpassed
$1,000 a metric ton in European wholesale markets for the first
time in more than two years, as Libyan exports decline. At the
pump, U.K. gasoline retail prices have been at record levels so
far this year, averaging 128.8 pence a liter ($7.92 a gallon) in
February.  To contact the reporters on this story:
