Two tea plants belonging to  Unilever
NV (UNA) ’s Kenyan unit suspended operations temporarily after dry
weather lowered production of green leaves, the  Daily Nation 
reported, citing Francis Kaptich, a technical director.  Tea processing is running below capacity at other Kenyan
estates, forcing some companies to cut working hours for
laborers plucking the leaves, the Nairobi-based newspaper said
today, citing Kenya Tea Growers Association Chairman Charles
Kipngok.  Mumbi Kyalo, a spokeswoman for Unilever Kenya Ltd., didn’t
immediately answer a message left on her office phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
