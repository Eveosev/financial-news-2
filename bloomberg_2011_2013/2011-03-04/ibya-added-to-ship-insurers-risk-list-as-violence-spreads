Libya, holder of  Africa ’s largest
oil reserves, was added to a list of areas deemed to be a higher
risk for shipping lines and  oil companies , a group advising the
insurance industry said.  The country was added to a list that already includes
Somalia, Iran,  Saudi Arabia , Venezuela and Iraq, Neil Roberts,
secretary of the Lloyd’s Market Association Joint War Committee,
said by phone today. While appearing on the list can be used by
insurers to help them determine premiums, it doesn’t give them a
right to charge higher prices.  “There’s enhanced risk,” Roberts said, adding that the
possibility of air strikes, collisions or vessels being unable
to leave or enter ports were among the reasons for the
reclassification.  An uprising in the North African country has left 6,000
people dead, the opposition forces’ spokesman, Abdullah Al
Mahdi, told  Al Jazeera  television today.  Fighting spread across the Gulf of Sidra with clashes in
the oil port of Ras Lanuf and the nearby desert area of Al
Agaila, according to Al Jazeera. In Brega, an energy hub east of
Ras Lanuf with a smaller terminal and refinery, an oil company
building was bombed, Al Arabiya said. The rebels have repelled
government attempts to retake Brega over the past three days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
