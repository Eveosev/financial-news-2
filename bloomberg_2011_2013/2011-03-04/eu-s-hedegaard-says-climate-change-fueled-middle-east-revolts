European Union Climate Commissioner  Connie Hedegaard  said extreme weather conditions linked to  climate change  were a factor in the unrest unfolding the Middle
East and North Africa.  The world suffered a record number of extreme weather events
such as storms, droughts and hurricanes last year, pushing
global food prices to a record and exacerbating social tensions
in Arab countries such as  Tunisia , where the first government
was toppled by demonstrators in January, Hedegaard said in a
speech today in Madrid.  “When you see extreme weather destroying harvests, the
immediate consequence is soaring food prices,” Hedegaard said.
“In Tunisia food costs are such an integral part of a family’s
whole economy. Then people start to protest.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
