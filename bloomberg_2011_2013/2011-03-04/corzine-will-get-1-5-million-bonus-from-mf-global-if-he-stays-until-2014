  MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MF)  agreed to
pay Chief Executive Officer Jon Corzine a retention bonus of
$1.5 million if he is still employed as of March 31, 2014, the
company said in a regulatory filing today.  Corzine, the former Governor of New Jersey who was co-
chairman of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  from 1994 to 1999, is
attempting to transform MF Global into a mid-size investment
bank from a derivatives brokerage. Last month, the firm was
designated as a primary dealer by the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York and Corzine has outlined plans to enter into asset
management and debt underwriting within the next three to five
years.  New York-based MF Global posted its seventh loss in the
past two years when it reported quarterly earnings last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
