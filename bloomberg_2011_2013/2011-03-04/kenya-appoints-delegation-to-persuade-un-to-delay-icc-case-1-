Kenyan President  Mwai Kibaki  named a
delegation including the vice president to persuade the United
Nations Security Council to defer an International Criminal
Court case against six Kenyans accused of inciting ethnic
violence.  The announcement was made in an e-mailed statement today
from the president’s office in Nairobi, the capital.  Kenya’s government wants a one-year postponement of the ICC
litigation to give it time to set up a local mechanism to handle
cases relating to attacks after a 2008 disputed election, Kibaki
said on Feb. 7.  The ICC in December named Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta 
and five others as suspects for allegedly orchestrating ethnic
fighting that killed 1,500 people in the East African nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
