Michael Phelps, who has won a record
14 Olympic gold medals, swam the fastest times this year in the
freestyle and butterfly events at the Indianapolis Grand Prix.  Phelps, 25, who won a single-Games record eight gold medals
at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, won the 200-meter freestyle in
1 minute, 46.27 seconds, and the 100 butterfly in 51.75 seconds.
He is scheduled to swim today in the 200-meter butterfly at the
University of Indiana Natatorium.  “I’m in a lot better shape than I was a month and a half
ago,” Phelps said. “I’m a lot more consistent. It’s making
gradual steps back to where I should be.”  In January, Phelps had to swim in the consolation final in
the 200-meter freestyle, covering the distance in 1 minute,
49.90 seconds at the Austin Grand Prix.  In the other two men’s individual events, Barry Murphy won
the men’s 100-meter breaststroke and Oussa Mellouli won the 400-
meter individual medley.  On the women’s side, Kathryn Hoff won the 200-meter
freestyle, Jessica Hardy won the 100-meter breaststroke, Dana
Vollmer won the 100-meter fly and Julia Smit won the 400-meter
individual medley.  To contact the reporter on this story:
