  UBS AG (UBSN)  Chief Executive Officer
Oswald Gruebel said he won’t accept a bonus for the year 2010,
the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an interview.  Greubel said he wouldn’t accept the payment because he
hadn’t been able to add value for shareholders; UBS returned to
profit last year and the outflow of wealthy client funds was
halted, the newspaper said.  the CEO said the share price had ended the year “at nearly
the same level as it began the year,” the WSJ cited him as
saying.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
