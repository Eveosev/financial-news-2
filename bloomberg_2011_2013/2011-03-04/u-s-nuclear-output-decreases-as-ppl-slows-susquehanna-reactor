U.S. nuclear-power output fell 1.1
percent as  PPL Corp. (PPL)  slowed the Susquehanna 1 reactor in
Pennsylvania, the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  said.  Production declined by 1,027 megawatts from yesterday to
92,023, or 91 percent of capacity, according to a  report  today
from the NRC and data compiled by Bloomberg. Nine reactors are
offline.  PPL Corp. reduced production from the 1,149-megawatt
Susquehanna 1 to 20 percent of capacity from 99 percent
yesterday after a suspected steam leak was found, the NRC said.  Another reactor at the site, the 1,140-megawatt Susquehanna
2, is operating at 94 percent of capacity. The plant is in
Luzerne County, 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Allentown.    Exelon Corp. (EXC)  slowed its 1,134-megawatt Limerick 1 reactor
30 miles northwest of Philadelphia to 90 percent of capacity
from full power yesterday. The 1,134-megawatt Limerick 2 is at
99 percent of capacity.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall, when demand for heating and cooling is
lower. The outages can increase demand for natural gas and coal
to generate electricity in place of nuclear power.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
