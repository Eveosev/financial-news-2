Estonian industrial production grew
in January at the slowest pace in four months as output of food
and electricity declined.  Production increased 28.8 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a revised 34.6 percent jump in December, the
Tallinn-based statistics office said today on its  website .
Output rose 4 percent from the previous month on a seasonally
adjusted basis.  The Baltic countryâ€™s industrial output grew at the fastest
pace in the 27-member European Union between July and December
on Swedish and Finnish demand, rising 23 percent for the full-
year after a 26 percent contraction in 2009. Estonia, which
adopted the euro in January, is relying on exports to recover
from the second-deepest recession in the EU in 2008 and 2009.  Economic expansion, at an annual 6.6 percent in the fourth
quarter, depends on how domestic demand recovers in coming
quarters as demand for exports may slow, according to the
central bank and  Finance Ministry .  Food production declined 0.2 percent from a year earlier,
while energy production shrank 0.9 percent.  Still, electronics manufacturing, led by the Estonian plant
of Stockholm-based wireless network maker Ericsson AB, rose an
annual 312 percent, compared with 252 percent jump in December,
data from the office showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
