Plymouth Argyle, the last-placed
club in English soccer’s third division, today entered
administration, a form of bankruptcy.  The team already was docked 10 points after saying it
intended to take the action. Its board voted to enter
administration, the club said on its website. Plymouth has 26
points and is in the relegation zone, 8 points behind Walsall,
which occupies the last non-demotion slot in Football League 1.  Brendan Guilfoyle was appointed administrator, and said
three parties have expressed interest in the 124-year-old team,
which doesn’t have money to pay players or staff. The potential
buyers wanted to purchase the club from an administrator to
reduce the cost, Guilfoyle said.  “I have practical difficulties at the moment: I’m not
currently funded so I’m prevailing upon the goodwill of staff
and players to continue to work without pay,” he said in a
statement on the website. “I am hoping to rectify that
situation shortly in conjunction with a potential buyer.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
