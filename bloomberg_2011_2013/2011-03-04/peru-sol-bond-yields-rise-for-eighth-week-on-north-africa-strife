  Peru ’s sol bond yields rose for an
eighth straight week as North African and Middle East turmoil
cut demand for riskier emerging-market assets.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 rose 8 basis points, or 0.08 percentage
point, to 6.28 percent this week, according to Deutsche Bank
AG’s local unit. The bond’s yield fell 2 basis points today.  The sol was little changed at 2.77 per  U.S. dollar  at the
close of trading today, from 2.7705 yesterday.  The central bank didn’t buy or sell dollars in the foreign
exchange market today, it said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
