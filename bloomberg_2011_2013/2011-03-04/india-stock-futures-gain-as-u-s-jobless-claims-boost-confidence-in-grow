Most Indian stocks dropped, paring
the weekly advance on the benchmark index amid concern the
recent rally may have been overdone.    Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the nation’s largest engineering
company, declined for the first time in four days, paring its
weekly gain to 6.4 percent. Indian stocks may lag behind broader
regional gains of as much as 30 percent in the next 12-18 months
as oil price rises, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc.  Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. (JPA) , a builder of roads and bridges,
slid 2.2 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, was
little changed at 18,486.45 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai.
Sixteen stocks dropped and 13 gained on the measure. The gauge
climbed 4.4 percent this week, the most since the five days
ended Nov. 5. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock
Exchange rose 0.1 percent to 5,538.75, while its April futures
settled at 5,568. The BSE 200 Index increased 0.1 percent to
2,266.33.  “Investor sentiment has improved due to the positive
announcement in the budget on fiscal deficit, lower government
borrowings and other economic reforms,” Kislay Kanth, head of
research at Mape Securities Pvt., said by phone in Mumbai. “The
rally is not going to continue at the same pace in the short
term, though the long term looks good. The concern over
inflation and  oil prices  due to the Middle East crisis is not
fully over yet.”  Worst Performer  The Sensex has lost 9.9 percent this year, the worst
performer in  Asia  among benchmark indexes tracked by Bloomberg,
as  India ’s central bank raised  interest rates  to stem inflation
worsened by a rally in the price of oil. Sensex companies trade
at an average 17.3 times estimated profit, down from a high of
about 21 times a year ago, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Larsen & Toubro decreased 3.2 percent to 1,610.8 rupees,
while its April futures settled at 1,630 rupees. Jaiprakash
Associates slid 2.2 percent to 84.05 rupees.  The bank is “cautious” of the government’s pledge to
narrow its  budget deficit  to 4.6 percent of gross domestic
product in the year to March 2012, Emil Wolter, Asian equities
strategist at RBS, said in Mumbai today.  India will narrow its budget deficit to 4.6 percent of
gross domestic product in the year to March 2012, Finance
Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in his annual budget speech to
parliament on Feb. 28. Spending on roads, ports and other large
projects will be increased by 23 percent in the year, he said.  Fund Withdrawals  Emerging-market stock mutual funds had their sixth straight
week of outflows, Citigroup Inc. said, citing data from research
firm EPFR Global. Redemptions of $2.5 billion in the week ended
March 2 quickened from $1.9 billion a week earlier, according to
a report today by  Markus Rosgen , a Hong Kong-based Citigroup
strategist.  Tata Power Co., the biggest electricity generator outside
state control, rose 2.7 percent to 1,224.1 rupees. The company’s
debt is viewed by traders as the safest in four months after
purchases of Indonesian mine stakes increased its control over
coal prices.  Traders are paying 299 basis points annually to insure Tata
Power’s debt, down from 641 basis points on Nov. 23. That’s the
largest decline among the eight Indian companies with credit-
default swaps for the period, according to CMA prices.  Pfizer Support    Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. (ARBP) , a drugmaker, increased 4.1 percent
to 183.75 rupees. Pfizer Inc., the world’s largest drugmaker,
will work with the supplier whose sales to the U.S. were
restricted by regulators, the New York-based company said in a
statement received by e-mail.    Gujarat Pipavav Port Ltd. (GPPV)  gained 0.9 percent to 60.65
rupees. The unit of AP Moeller-Maersk A/S was rated “buy” by
Sandeep Mathew and other BNP Paribas SA analysts in initial
coverage on the view that 2011 will likely be the company’s
first year of profitability on “improved” container volumes
and lower interest costs.  Overseas investors bought a net 4.67 billion rupees ($103.5
million) of Indian equities on March 1, paring their outflow
from equities this year to 90 billion rupees, according the
Securities and Exchange Board of India’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
