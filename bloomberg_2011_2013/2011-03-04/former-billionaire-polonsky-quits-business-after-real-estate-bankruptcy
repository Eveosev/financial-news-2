Sergei Polonsky, ranked  Russia ’s 40th
richest man with a fortune of $4.35 billion by Forbes magazine
in 2008, said he’s quitting business after his property
developer went bankrupt.  Polonsky’s Mirax Group, which started building what was
planned to be  Europe ’s tallest skyscraper before the global
financial crisis in 2008, was dissolved by its board of
directors yesterday, the company said on its  website .  The unfinished 506-meter (1,660-foot) Federation Tower in
Moscow’s new financial district will be completed by state-run
OAO Sberbank, a Mirax creditor, the company said. Other
unfinished Mirax projects will be completed by other creditors,
the company said.  “I’m not a businessman anymore,” Polonsky, 38, said in
Moscow yesterday, according to the Vedomosti newspaper.  The St. Petersburg-native, a prolific blogger, challenged
fellow billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov  in June 2008 to a $10
million bet that the Onexim Group owner would fail as a
property developer. Earlier that year, Polonsky told an
audience of wealthy developers at a real estate conference
that anyone who didn’t have $1 billion could “go to hell,” a
remark widely reported in the Russian media since.  To contact the reporters on this story:
