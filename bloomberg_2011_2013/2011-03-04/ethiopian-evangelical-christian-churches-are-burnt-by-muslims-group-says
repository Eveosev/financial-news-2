Churches and homes used by
evangelical Christians in southwestern  Ethiopia  were burned down
by Muslims over the past two days, according to  International
Christian Concern .  Federal police in the Horn of Africa nation intervened
after three churches and two houses were torched following an
alleged burning of the Koran in Asendabo, the Washington DC-
based rights group said in a statement on its website. Two more
churches were then burned, it said, citing local church leaders.
Asendabo is about 280 kilometers (174 miles) southwest of Addis
Ababa.  Ethiopian Communications Minister Bereket Simon said that
only two houses used for worship were burned in the incident.  “No one has died,” he said by phone from Addis Ababa. “It’s
a very minor, isolated incident.”  Calls to the Ethiopian Islamic Affairs Supreme Council
weren’t answered or didn’t connect when Bloomberg News sought
comment today.  Ethiopian Kale Heywot Church, an Addis Ababa-based
evangelical organization, said today it would make a statement
once it had met with the government and carried out its own
investigation.  Incidents of religious strife in Ethiopia are rare,
although there have been sectarian clashes in the south-west in
recent years. Ethiopia’s population includes 34 percent Muslims
and 63 percent Christians, according to the CIA World Factbook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
