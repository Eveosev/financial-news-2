  Scottish & Southern Energy Plc (SSE) , Dong
Energy A/S, Eneco Holding NV and Statkraft AS are calling on the
European Union to set a tougher carbon-dioxide target to help
promote cleaner energy.  Chief executives at the four energy companies said the EU
should raise its emission-cutting target for 2020 to 25 percent
below 1990 levels, compared with the current benchmark of 20
percent. Public Power Corp. SA and Sorgenia SpA also signed the
declaration to the EU.  “We know that the benefits of early action far outweigh
the costs of inertia or delayed action,” they said today in an
e-mailed statement. “Private investors take their signals from
such targets, and more ambitious targets will stimulate more low
carbon investment.”  The European Commission, regulator of the 27-nation bloc,
said in a draft report last week that increasing the target may
be achievable with more energy conservation and investment into
low-carbon systems. The EU draft, due to be presented to
national leaders next week, is a political compromise, as member
states remain split on raising the target.  EU emission permits for December were little changed,
slipping 1 cent to 15.44 euros a metric ton as of 8:40 a.m. on  London ’s ICE Futures  Europe .  Western countries including  France ,  Germany  and the U.K.
have called for a more-ambitious goal, and eastern nations tend
to favor a more-cautious approach. The EU, which is poised to
meet its 2020 target, aims to cut domestic emissions by at least
80 percent as of 2050.  Editor: Mike Anderson, Randall Hackley.  To contact the reporter on this story:
