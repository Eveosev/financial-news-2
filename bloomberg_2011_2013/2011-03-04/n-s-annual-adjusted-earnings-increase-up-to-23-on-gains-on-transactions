  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) ,  Africa ’s largest
provider of mobile-phone services, said 2010 adjusted earnings
per share, excluding one-time items, probably rose 18 percent to
23 percent, helped by gains from financial transactions.  Adjustments came about as a result of put options on
subsidiaries in Nigeria and in Afghanistan, as well as a
reversal of costs from  South Africa ’s Zakhele empowerment
program aimed at bringing in more black citizens as investors,
Johannesburg-based MTN said today in a statement. Earnings per
share attributable to shareholders will be in a range of 5
percent less than a year earlier to 1 percent more, it said.  Last year the company offered 80.9 million new shares to
the black South African public at 20 rand a share, raising 2.78
billion rand ($403 million).  Nigeria  is MTN’s biggest single
market, generating the bulk of the 50.5 billion rand of revenue
that came from from western and central Africa in 2009, when
MTN’s worldwide sales totaled 112 billion rand.  MTN fell as much as 1.8 percent to 123.55 rand and was down
0.3 percent as of 10:26 a.m. in Johannesburg trading. The stock
has fallen 6.8 percent this year.  The company is tentatively scheduled to release full-year
earnings details on March 9, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
