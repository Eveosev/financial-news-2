  CBS Corp. (CBS)  agreed to buy Clicker
Media Inc. and named that company’s chief executive officer, Jim
Lanzone, to replace the departing head of CBS Interactive.  Financial terms of the purchase weren’t disclosed,
according to a statement today by New York-based CBS, owner of
the most-watched U.S. television network.  Lanzone, former CEO of Ask.com, will oversee CBS
Interactive’s worldwide operations. He assumes the role held by
Neil Ashe, who announced in December he would step down once a
successor was chosen. Ashe is leaving two years after CBS
acquired Cnet Networks, where he was CEO.  CBS, controlled by Chairman  Sumner Redstone , fell 67 cents,
or 2.8 percent, to $23.68 at 12:13 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares had climbed 28 percent
this year before today.  Clicker.com, based in  Los Angeles , has 2.5 million monthly
visitors who use the service to find legally posted TV shows,
movies and videos on the Web, CBS said. Lanzone will be based at
CBS’s San Francisco offices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
