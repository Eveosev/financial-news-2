The dollar fluctuated versus the
euro after U.S. employers added 192,000 workers in February and
the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly fell to 8.9 percent, the
lowest level since April 2009.  The greenback traded little changed at $1.3967 per euro at
9:14 a.m. in New York, from $1.3969 yesterday, after falling as
much as 0.2 percent. It touched $1.40 per euro for the first
time since Nov. 8. The shared currency appreciated 0.2 percent
to 115.43 yen, and the dollar rose 0.2 percent to 82.63 yen.  “We were expecting this to be a fairly strong number
because we felt that there weren’t any influences from weather,”
said  Andrew Busch , a global currency strategist at Bank of
Montreal in  Chicago . “We got better-than-expected data, but it’s
mixed.”  The yen depreciated for the fifth straight day versus the
dollar as Labor Department data showed payrolls increased amid
an improving economy and more seasonable weather. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey was for a gain of 196,000.
Private hiring, which excludes government agencies, rose by
222,000 in February, exceeding the 200,000 median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey.  “The day may be dollar-positive because we’ve had a lot of
dollar weakness recently, so this may be a little bit of a
relief rally since the euro went from $1.34 to $1.40 in two
weeks without a pause,” said Carl Forcheski, a director on the
corporate currency sales desk at Societe Generale SA in  New
York .  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks
the greenback against the currencies of six major trade
partners, was little changed at 76.485 after falling for the
past two days.  Past Reports  The index increased 0.4 percent Feb. 4 after the U.S.
reported January payrolls rose by 36,000, less than the 146,000
forecast by economists. It rose 0.3 percent Jan. 7, when a
report showed payrolls increased less than expected in December
and the unemployment rate dropped.  The dollar fell earlier today against the euro as stock
markets rose before the payrolls report.  The euro headed for a third straight weekly increase
against the greenback, the longest run of gains since October,
after European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said
yesterday the ECB may increase interest rates at its next
meeting. Sterling declined against the dollar after  house prices 
fell in February, fueling concern that the economic recovery
won’t be sustained.  ECB Rates  The greenback tumbled yesterday versus the euro after
Trichet’s statement. The ECB has kept its key rate at 1 percent
since May 2009 to support the economy.  The  Federal Reserve  has kept the U.S. benchmark at zero to
0.25 percent since December 2008, and Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said in congressional testimony this week the American economy
still needs the support of a low rate.  “Interest-rate spreads are very, very important in currency
valuations,”  John Taylor , chairman of New York-based FX
Concepts LLC, the world’s biggest currency hedge fund, said
yesterday in a Bloomberg Television interview on “In the Loop”
with Betty Liu. “Dollar  interest rates  are not going
anywhere.”  The dollar dropped over the first four days of the week
versus 12 of its 16 most-traded counterparts even as reports
showed an improving U.S. economy. The Fed said in a business
survey the labor market improved throughout the country early
this year, and manufacturing and service industries both
expanded more than forecast in February.  Service Businesses  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non-
manufacturing businesses increased to 59.7, the highest level
since August 2005, from 59.4 in January, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group said yesterday. Economists in a Bloomberg survey
forecast the gauge would fall to 59.3.  The ISM’s factory index increased to 61.4 from 60.8 in
January, the fastest pace since May 2004, data showed on March
1. Readings greater than 50 signal growth.  Overall, the  U.S. economy  “continued to expand at a modest
to moderate pace,” the central bank said March 2 in its Beige
Book survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
