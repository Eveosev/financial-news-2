German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
party may struggle to hold on to power in the state of Baden-
Wuerttemberg together with its Free Democratic Party ally, a
weekly TNS Emnid poll for Focus magazine showed.  Combined support for Merkel’s  Christian Democratic Union 
and the FDP held at 46 percent, with the CDU shedding 2
percentage points to 38 percent and the FDP gaining 2 points to
8 percent, Focus said in an advance copy of an article for its
print edition.  Backing for the opposition Social Democrats and the Greens
also was at 46 percent, with the SPD gaining 2 points to 25
percent and the Greens dropping 1 point to 21 percent. The anti-
capitalist Left party, holding at 4 percent, doesn’t have enough
support to overcome the 5 percent hurdle for parliamentary
representation, the poll showed.  Emnid’s is the  fifth poll in a week  to show the two blocs
in a statistical dead heat, suggesting Merkel’s party, led by
state Prime Minister Stefan Mappus, may lose its 57-year hold on
power in Baden-Wuerttemberg, home to Stuttgart-based  Daimler AG (DAI) 
and  Robert Bosch GmbH .  Emnid polled 1,000 voters, Focus said, without saying when
the survey was conducted and without providing a margin of
error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
