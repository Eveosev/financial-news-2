Chilean interest-rate swap rates
surged after minutes from the central bank’s last meeting showed
policy makers ruled out a pause and suggested they may need to
increase the pace of rate rises in coming months.  The one-year rate in pesos, which reflects expectations for
average future rates, climbed seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, the most in a month, to a two-year high of
5.07 percent. Three-month and six-month rates climbed eight
basis points and 10 basis points, respectively.  Central bank President Jose De Gregorio said today that he
expects rate increases and the minutes showed that policy makers
discussed the possibility that rising inflation would force them
to accelerate rate increases. The bank raised its benchmark rate
by 25 basis points last month as inflation expectations rose to
two-year highs.  “Shorter rates are up,” said Rodrigo Blazquez, a trader
at Deutsche Bank AG in Santiago. “The minutes spoke about
inflation and people are assuming the central bank won’t pause
in its coming meetings. A sell-off of 10 basis points may be an
overreaction though.”  Chile’s peso slid 0.2 percent to 474.05 per dollar after
gaining as much as 0.4 percent to 471.36.  To contact the reporter on this story:
