U.S. stock-index futures advanced,
signaling benchmark gauges may extend their biggest rallies in
three months, as investors awaited a government jobs report that
may add to evidence the economy is improving.    Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  rose 0.8 percent after increasing its
quarterly dividend.  Intel Corp. (INTC)  gained after Robert W. Baird &
Co. recommended the shares.  Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) 
plunged 5.9 percent after predicting first-quarter sales that
trailed analysts’ estimates.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  slid as
Bank of America Corp. cut its rating on the bank.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
March rose 0.1 percent at 1,331.2 at 7:58 a.m. in  New York . The
gauge surged 1.7 percent yesterday, the biggest increase since
Dec. 1. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures advanced 0.2
percent to 12,264 today, and Nasdaq-100 Index futures increased
0.1 percent to 2,374.25.  “The U.S. payrolls report for February is the main event
of the day,”  Adrian Foster , head of financial-market research
for Asia at Rabobank Groep NV in  Hong Kong , wrote in an e-mailed
note.  The Labor Department’s February jobs data is due to be
released at 8:30 a.m. in Washington. Payrolls grew by 196,000
workers last month, the most since May 2010, after a 36,000 gain
in January, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. The
release may also show the jobless rate rose to 9.1 percent from
9 percent.  Company Earnings  The S&P 500 has risen 0.8 percent this week, heading for
the fourth weekly advance in five amid better-than-estimated
corporate earnings. Out of 470 companies in the index that have
reported quarterly results since Jan. 10, 332 have topped
analysts’ projections for per-share profit, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Wal-Mart gained 0.8 percent to $52.42 as the world’s
largest retailer increased its quarterly dividend to 36.5 cents,
more than the Bloomberg estimate for 32.5 cents.  Intel advanced 0.5 percent to $21.90 in Germany. The
world’s biggest chipmaker was upgraded to “outperform” from
“neutral” at Robert Baird.    LSB Industries Inc. (LXU)  rose 2.3 percent to $32.82 in German
trading. The maker of chemical and climate control products
reported fourth-quarter profit of 79 cents a share, more than
double the average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Marvell Slides  Marvell Technology, a maker of processors for the
BlackBerry phone, retreated 5.9 percent to $17.15 in early New
York trading. First-quarter revenue will be $800 million to $850
million, said Clyde Hosein, the company’s chief financial
officer, on a conference call. That compares with an average
estimate of $882.5 million, according to a Bloomberg survey of
21 analysts.  Goldman Sachs fell 1 percent to $162.88 and  Citigroup Inc. (C) 
slipped 0.9 percent to $4.64 as Bank of America Corp. cut its
recommendation on both stocks to “neutral” from “buy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
