  Kenya ’s shilling depreciated for a
second day and headed for the weakest since 1994 against the
dollar as demand for the U.S. currency by businesses to pay for
imports and outward dividend payments outstripped supply.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy weakened 0.7
percent to 83.45 per dollar by 11:51 a.m. in Nairobi from a
close of 82.90 shillings yesterday.    Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd. (BCBL) , the country’s second-biggest
lender, on Feb. 22 doubled its dividend to 5.45 shillings a
share for the year through December. Linde AG’s BOC Kenya Ltd.
will pay a special dividend of 6 shillings and a final dividend
of 1.4 shillings, it said Feb. 18, while Lafarge SA’s Bamburi
Cement Co. declared a final dividend of 7 shillings on Feb 25.  “The shilling is on a weakening note as businesses cover
their import bills, outward payment of dividends and low
inflows, creating a mismatch,” Jeremiah Kendagor, head of
trading at Nairobi-based  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , said in a
phone interview today.  Kenya expects to record a drop in agricultural produce,
which will impact dollar inflows. Tea production in January
declined to 35.9 million kilograms (79.1 million pounds)
compared to 37.7 million kilograms in January 2010, the Nairobi-
based  Daily Nation  reported today, citing the Kenya Tea Board.  “The current dry spell will have an impact on agricultural
inflows,” which will put the shilling under pressure, Kendagor
said. Kenya’s currency is poised to breach the psychological
level of 84 shillings to the dollar, he said, adding it might
test 85 shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
