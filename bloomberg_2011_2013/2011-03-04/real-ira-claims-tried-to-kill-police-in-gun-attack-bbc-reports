The Real Irish Republican Army,
which murdered two British soldiers in  Northern Ireland  in 2009,
said it tried to kill police officers in a gun attack in the
U.K. region on March 2, the  British Broadcasting Corp . reported.  The terrorist group said in a statement it fired shots at
police officers in Derry, in the northwest of the region, and
that more attacks will follow, the  BBC  reported, without giving
any further details.  The  Police Service of Northern Ireland  said yesterday in an
e-mailed statement that the attack, which didnâ€™t cause any
casualties, was an attempt to murder its officers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
