The Philippine peso climbed to a
four-month high and three-year bonds fell on speculation policy
makers will raise borrowing costs to tame inflation.  Official data released today showed February consumer
prices rose 4.3 percent from a year earlier, the most since May
2010, prompting central bank Governor Amando Tetangco to
reiterate that the scope to keep  interest rates  steady has
narrowed.  “The market is more convinced that a rate increase can
happen as early as this month,” said Lito Mercado, head of
trading at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. in Manila.  The peso climbed 0.2 percent to 43.268 per dollar as of the
4 p.m. close in Manila, the strongest level since Nov. 10,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency gained one percent
this week.  The yield on the 6.25 percent bond due January 2014 rose
three basis points to 5.4 percent and was unchanged from last
week, according to Tradition Financial Services. The rate
increased as much as 13 basis points earlier today.  The central bank will use the latest inflation reading to
“determine if the new expected path would lead to average
inflation forecasts that would risk breaching the target for the
policy horizon,” Tetangco said in a mobile-phone text message
today.  The monetary authority aims to keep average inflation
within 3 percent and 5 percent until 2013, Tetangco said this
week. Policy makers next meet to review rates on March 24.  To contact the reporter for this story:
