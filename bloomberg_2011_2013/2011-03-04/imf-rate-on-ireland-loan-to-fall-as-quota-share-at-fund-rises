The interest rate Ireland will pay
the  International Monetary Fund  as part of a 22.5 billion-euro
loan ($31.4 billion) will decline as a 2008 agreement boosting
its say at the institution and giving the nation greater access
to financing takes effect.  The average interest rate “at the peak level of access”
under the loan will be 3.04 percent on credit outstanding less
than three years, down from 3.17 percent, the IMF said in a
statement today in Washington. The rate will be 3.85 percent on
credit outstanding longer than three years, it said.  Under the 2008 deal, Ireland and other countries had
changes in their so-called quotas, an amount paid that
determines  voting rights  and access to IMF loans. Ireland’s
quota will grow by 50 percent to the equivalent of about 1.4
billion euros, the IMF said, and access to long-term financing
will decline to 1,548 percent of its quota from 2,322 percent.  “This reduction in average interest rate is the result of
the implementation of existing fund policies under the agreed
increase in quotas and not of a change in policy,” the fund
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
