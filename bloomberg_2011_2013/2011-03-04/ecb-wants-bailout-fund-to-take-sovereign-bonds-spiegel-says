The  European Central Bank  wants to
transfer the 77.5 billion euros ($108 billion) of government
bonds it has bought to Europe’s rescue fund, Spiegel magazine
reported, citing unidentified sources with “direct knowledge of
the developments.”  ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet is pushing governments to
adopt the plan, though they have so far expressed little
support, Spiegel said.  The magazine said German Chancellor Angela Merkel and
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  may support a move that
would allow troubled peripheral states such as Greece and
Portugal to borrow money from the fund -- the European Financial
Stability Facility -- to buy back their own bonds from the
market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
