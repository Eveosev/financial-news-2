  Hungary ’s fiscal plan unveiled this
week may help the government cope “effectively” with reducing
public debt, according to Laszlo Bencsik, deputy chief executive
officer of OTP Bank Nyrt., the country’s largest lender.  “The goals that we read about in the new plan deal very
effectively with what we also think is at the core of Hungary’s
problems,” namely the country’s debt level, Bencsik told
reporters today in Budapest.  Hungary, which has the highest debt level in the eastern
part of the European Union, plans to save as much as 900 billion
forint ($4.6 billion) annually in 2013 and 2014, starting with
550 billion forint in 2012, Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy 
said on March 1. The austerity measures will include delaying a
cut in the corporate income tax, extending a bank tax and
tighter retirement and welfare rules.  The debt level may fall to 68 percent of gross domestic
product by 2014, compared with a government estimate of 66
percent, from 80 percent last year, OTP said. Hungarian
indebtedness may drop to 75 percent in 2011 after the government
effectively nationalized an estimated 3 trillion forint in
private pension fund portfolios, according to the lender.  The budget balance may show a surplus of 3.6 percent this
year, including private pension funds, compared with an original
deficit target of 3.8 percent of GDP last year, OTP said.  Without pension funds, the deficit may meet the
government’s 2.9 percent target for this year and may fall to
1.4 percent in 2014, OTP said. The government targets a
shortfall of 1.9 percent in 2014.  To contact the reporters on this story:
