Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  will
be killed either by one of his sons, relatives or officers,
 Echorouk  reported, citing  Libya ’s deputy director of ‭military
intelligence and commander of the Libyan Republican Guard.  Qaddafi will fall “very soon,” the Algerian  newspaper 
reported, citing Suleiman Mahmoud Suleiman, who said he was
siding with Libyans who started a revolt against Qaddafi in mid
February and was no longer supporting him.  The Libyan leader had become “insane,” Suleiman told he
 newspaper . “There is no leader in the history of
revolutionaries that tried to be king and sought titles for
himself other than Qaddafi, when he claimed he was the king of
kings of  Africa ,” he said. “That’s when I realized he was mad
and also earlier when he began to take steps to pass on power to
his son.”  Suleiman told Echorouk he and Qaddafi began to fall out
three years ago when he confronted the Libyan leader about his
plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
