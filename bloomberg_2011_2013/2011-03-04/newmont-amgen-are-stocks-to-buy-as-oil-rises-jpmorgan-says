The rise in  oil prices  is a “real
risk” for U.S. markets, and investors should consider stocks
including  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)  based on the potential for crude
to stay high, JPMorgan Chase said.  A $20-a-barrel rise in the price of oil over three months
has an impact of $2.22 in earnings per share for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index, Thomas Lee, chief U.S. equity strategist at
the New York-based bank, said in a note yesterday. There’s
“downside risk” to JPMorgan’s 2011  S&P 500  earnings-per-share
estimate of $97.50, though not to the 1,425 year-end forecast,
he said. Crude for April delivery rose $2.51 today to $104.42 a
barrel, the highest settlement since Sept. 26, 2008.  “The seeds of a pullback are being sown,” Lee said in the
note. “A sustained rise of $20 per barrel in oil is $145
billion in incremental oil spend (70 percent via gasoline) and
effectively acts as a tax on households.” JPMorgan doesn’t
expect the “supply shock” to affect the full year, he said.  Oil rose today as civil unrest in Libya fueled concern that
supply disruptions in Africa’s third-largest producer will be
prolonged. Demonstrations have toppled leaders in Tunisia and
Egypt, while there have been protests in countries including
Iraq, Iran, Yemen and Oman.  In  Saudi Arabia , the biggest oil producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, websites have
called for a nationwide “Day of Rage” on March 11 and March
20, according to Human Rights Watch.  Oil’s Rise  Crude has advanced 15 percent so far this year. The S&P 500
has gained 5.1 percent in 2011, after slipping 0.7 percent to
1,321.15 today.  Newmont Mining,  Metals USA Holdings Corp. (MUSA) , Thompson Creek
Metals Co.,  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ,  DHT Holdings
Inc. (DHT) ,  Amgen Inc. (AMGN) ,  Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD) ,  Jabil Circuit Inc. (JBL)  and  Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD)  are among stocks that may benefit from a
positive leverage to oil and have a “low” price-to-earnings
ratio and an “overweight” rating from JPMorgan, as well as the
potential to rise at least 10 percent based on JPMorgan’s price
estimate, Lee said.  U.S. Cellular Corp.,  MDC Holdings Inc. (MDC) ,  Affymetrix Inc. (AFFX) ,  Beazer Homes USA Inc. (BZH)  and  Standard Pacific Corp. (SPF)  are stocks to
avoid, based on similar criteria, Lee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
