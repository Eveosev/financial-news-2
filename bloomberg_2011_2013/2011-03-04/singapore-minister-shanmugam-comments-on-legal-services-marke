K. Shanmugam,  Singapore ’s Law
Minister, comments on the city’s legal services market and its
development as an arbitration hub. Shanmugam made the comments
in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  On having more Qualifying Foreign Law Practice licenses:  “We will review the QFLP scheme later this year with a
view to further liberalization.”  On legal services’ contribution to the economy:  “In 2009, the legal services sector contributed 0.6
percent to Singapore’s GDP, or S$1.59 billion. This represents a
year-on-year growth of 6 percent from S$1.5 billion in 2008. The
growth compares favorably against the overall Singapore economy,
which shrank by 0.5 percent in 2009.”  On Singapore as an arbitration center:  “Underpinning this all is Singapore’s reputation as a
neutral venue, as well as the independence of our judiciary and
its emphasis on party autonomy and the finality of the arbitral
award. Parties are assured that the courts do not intervene too
readily in arbitral proceedings in Singapore, and they respect
party autonomy and parties’ decision to arbitrate.  ‘‘Our rules essentially give complete freedom to disputing
parties to have their arbitration heard in Singapore, use any
governing law, and to have lawyers from any country and
jurisdiction represent them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
