The owners of Queen’s Park Rangers,
the first-place team in English soccer’s second division, said
they may sell 67 percent shareholding in the club.  Takeover discussions are “at an early stage,” and it’s
unknown whether a takeover will happen, QPR Holdings Ltd. said
today in a Regulatory News Service statement.  The Sun reported 
two days ago that a group of American and Asian businessmen were
interested in taking the stake in the team.  Last year, Flavio Briatore resigned as chairman. He had
worked with Formula One boss  Bernie Ecclestone  and steel magnate  Lakshmi Mittal  to buy the west London team in 2007. Mittal has
boosted his holding in the club since the takeover.  QPR has a five-point lead at the top of English soccer’s
Championship, with 67 points after 34 games. Swansea is in
second.  To contact the reporter on this story:
