Crude oil in  New York  increased to a
29-month high on concern that turmoil in  Libya  will spread to
other northern African and Middle East energy exporters, curbing
shipments.  Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  sent troops to recapture
towns in the western part of the country and prepared to quash
protests in the capital, Tripoli. Oil also advanced on signals
that U.S. economic growth is accelerating. The nation’s jobless
rate fell to 8.9 percent, the lowest since April 2009, a
government report showed.  “Unrest in Libya continues to fuel concerns about
supplies,” said  Addison Armstrong , a director of market
research at Tradition Energy, a Stamford, Connecticut-based
broker. “We’re facing a weekend amid a drumbeat of instability.
Nobody wants to be short when there could be a major disruption
over the next two days.”  In other markets, cotton futures surged to a record on
signs that global demand from textile mills will continue to
outpace supplies. Gold and silver also climbed. The UBS
Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index advanced 0.3 percent
to 1,793.05. Earlier, the gauge reached 1,800.63, extending a
rally to a record.  Oil futures for April delivery increased $2.51, or 2.5
percent, to $104.42 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the highest settlement since Sept. 26, 2008. The price
rose 6.7 percent this week, the third straight advance.    Brent crude  for April settlement rose $1.18, or 1 percent,
to $115.97 a barrel on London-based ICE Futures  Europe . The
contract gained 3.4 percent this week, the sixth straight
increase.  Cotton  Cotton for May delivery jumped by the exchange limit of 7
cents, or 3.4 percent, to a record of $2.127 a pound on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. The price rose for the sixth straight
session, the longest rally since Nov. 5.  Output in  China , the world’s biggest consumer, fell 6.3
percent last year, the National Bureau of Statistics said this
week. U.S. sales surged 56 percent to 403,341 bales in the week
ended Feb. 24 from a week earlier, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said yesterday. Prices have more than doubled in the
past year.  “It’s a worldwide scramble,” said  John Flanagan , the
president of Flanagan Trading Corp. in Fuquay-Varina,  North
Carolina . “The last holdouts realized there was no way out
other than just buying, trying to find cotton to keep their
mills running.”  Gold, Silver  Gold rose as mounting tensions in Libya boosted the appeal
of the precious metal as an investment haven. Silver toped $35
an ounce, extending a rally to the highest in 31 years.  Libyan opposition leaders rejected a mediation offer by
Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  as armed rebels fought for
control of crude-oil ports on the central and eastern coastal
strip. Gold climbed for the sixth straight week, the longest
rally since September 2007. On March 2, the metal reached a
record of $1,441 an ounce.  “There are still a lot of moving parts in the Middle East
and North Africa,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior strategist
at Lind-Waldock in  Chicago . “People want to be long gold and
silver going into a weekend where’s there’s a lot of macro risk
in the market.”  Gold futures for April delivery rose $12.20, or 0.9
percent, to $1,428.60 on the Comex in New York. The metal rose
1.4 percent this week.  Silver futures for May delivery jumped $1, or 2.9 percent,
to $35.327. Earlier, the price reached $35.405, the highest
since March 1980. In that year, the metal reached a record
$50.35.  This week, silver gained 7.3 percent, the sixth straight
increase. That marked the longest rally since March 2008.  Commodities settled as follows:  Precious metals:
