Oil rigs operating in the U.S.
jumped by the most this year as prices climbed to a 29-month
high, according to data published by  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)  The
number of natural gas rigs dropped to a one-year low.  Oil rigs climbed 18 to 801, the biggest one-week increase
since the seven days ended Dec. 10, Baker Hughes said on its
 website . It was the countâ€™s first advance in four weeks.  Crude for April delivery rose $2.51, or 2.5 percent, to
$104.42 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
highest settlement since Sept. 26, 2008.  The combined oil and gas rig count increased by eight to
1,707, also the first gain in four weeks. The tally rose to a
22-year high in 2008, peaking at 2,031. Rigs increased the most
in  Colorado , by seven, and fell the most in  Pennsylvania , by 11.  Natural gas rigs declined by seven to 899, the lowest level
in more than a year. The gas rig count is 44 percent below a
peak of 1,606 in 2008.  Miscellaneous rigs, which primarily drill for geothermal
energy, dropped by three to seven.  Gas for April delivery rose 3.1 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$3.809 per million British thermal units on the Nymex.  Rigs on land rose by seven to 1,665. Rigs in inland waters
gained one to 17.  The rig count for offshore production and the  Gulf of
Mexico  in particular were unchanged from the prior week at 25.  Canadian rigs rose by two to 625.  To contact the reporter on this story:
