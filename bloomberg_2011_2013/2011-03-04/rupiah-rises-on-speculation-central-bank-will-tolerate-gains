  Indonesia ’s rupiah headed for
a seventh weekly gain, its longest winning streak since August
2008, on speculation the central bank will let the currency
appreciate as it seeks to contain inflation.  The currency climbed to its strongest level in almost four
years after overseas investors bought $62 million more
Indonesian shares than they sold this week though yesterday.  Bank Indonesia  will allow currency strengthening to help keep
imported inflation in check, Deputy Governor Hartadi Sarwono
said on Feb. 24. The central bank will leave its benchmark
interest rate unchanged at a review today, according to most
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “One of the factors for the appreciation in the rupiah is
that the central bank wants to control inflation,” said Joanna Tan, a Singapore-based economist at Forecast Singapore Pte. “Of
course, the BI will smooth volatility, so it won’t allow
excessive gains. People are cautious today as they wait for the
rate decision.”  The rupiah advanced 0.5 percent this week, and 0.1 percent
today, to 8,792 per dollar as of 9:05 a.m. in Jakarta, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Policy makers won’t add to last month’s interest-rate
increase in today’s meeting, according to 10 of 17 economists in
a Bloomberg survey. Seven predict the central bank will raise
the rate by 25 basis points to 7 percent.  Inflation moderated to 6.84 percent last month from a year
earlier from a 21-month high of 7.02 percent in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
