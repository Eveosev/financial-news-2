The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default declined, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 1 basis point to
106 basis points as of 9:45 a.m. in Sydney, according to Nomura
Holdings Inc. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-
grade borrowers outside Japan fell 1 basis point to 107 basis
points as of 8:14 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 1 basis point to 99.5 as
of 9:24 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on  credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporters on this story:
