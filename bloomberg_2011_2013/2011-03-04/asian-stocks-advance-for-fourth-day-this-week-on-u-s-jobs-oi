Asian stocks rose for the fourth day
this week after fewer Americans filed unemployment claims and
oil prices eased for the first time in three days.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, climbed
1.1 percent in Tokyo as the dollar strengthened against the yen,
boosting the outlook for Japanese export earnings. Canon Inc.,
the world’s No. 1 maker of cameras, advanced 2.1 percent.  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  increased 1.5 percent in Sydney after copper rose
to a two-week high in  London  yesterday. Li & Fung Ltd., the
biggest supplier to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and other U.S.
retailers, increased 3.7 percent in  Hong Kong .  “Reduced unemployment claims in America add to confidence
that the U.S. is on the verge of much stronger employment growth
that will make its recovery self sustaining,” said  Shane Oliver ,
head of investment strategy in Sydney at AMP Capital Investors
Ltd., which manages about $93 billion. “That’s great news for
Asian exports. Lower oil prices potentially mean less of a
threat to Asian inflation and economic growth.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 1.2 percent to 139.50 at
2:40 p.m. in Tokyo. It has gained 1.9 percent this week, on
course for the highest close since Feb. 21. The gauge retreated
2.1 percent last week on concern political turmoil in the Middle
East and North Africa may jeopardize a global economic recovery.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 0.8 percent.  South
Korea ’s Kospi Index climbed 1.3 percent and  Australia ’s S&P/ASX
200 Index gained 1.2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index
increased 1.2 percent.  U.S. Employment  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
today. The index climbed 1.7 percent yesterday in  New York , the
most in three months, after the Labor Department said
applications for  unemployment benefits  fell by 20,000 to 368,000
in the week ended Feb. 26. Economists had forecast a gain to
395,000. The total number of Americans receiving unemployment
benefits fell to the lowest level since October 2008.  In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management’s
index of non-manufacturing businesses climbed to 59.7, the
highest level since August 2005. Economists had forecast a drop
to 59.3. A reading above 50 signals growth in the service sector.  “There should be some buying across the board,” said
Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings
Inc. “The yen is weakening,  oil prices  have taken a breather
and you’ve got some better economic data.”  Toyota, Canon  Toyota climbed 1.1 percent to 3,780 yen in Tokyo and Canon
advanced 2.1 percent to 3,945 yen. Advantest Corp., the world’s
No. 1 maker of memory-chip testers, gained 2.5 percent to 1,714
yen.  The yen depreciated to 115.17 against the euro from 113.58
at the close of stock trading in Tokyo yesterday, the weakest
level since Nov. 4, after European Central Bank President Jean- Claude Trichet said the ECB may raise  interest rates  next month
to counter accelerating inflation.  Against the dollar, Japan’s currency weakened to 82.52, a
level not seen since Feb. 24, from 81.88. A weaker yen boosts
the value of overseas income at Japanese companies when
converted into their home currency.    BHP Billiton , the world’s biggest mining company, gained
1.5 percent to A$47.25 in Sydney and Rio Tinto Group, the third-
largest, rose 1.6 percent to A$85.52 after copper rose for a
second straight day in London yesterday.  Crude oil for April delivery dropped 0.3 percent to settle
at $101.91 a barrel in New York yesterday after Venezuela
offered to mediate the conflict in Libya, Africa’s third-largest
oil producer, and as the  Associated Press  reported army
deserters secured oil facilities in the rebel-held port of Brega
on the Gulf of Sidra.  Newcrest Surges    Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) , Australia’s largest gold producer,
surged 4.7 percent to A$40.02 after almost doubling the
estimated size of a gold deposit in Papua New Guinea.  Drilling results at Wafi Golpu in Morobe Province included
a revised exploration target to more than 30 million ounces of
gold and 8 million metric tons of copper, compared with an
earlier target of 16 million ounces of gold and 4.9 million tons
of copper, Newcrest said in a presentation.  Li & Fung added 3.7 percent to HK$45.25 in Hong Kong.  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) , Hong Kong’s No. 1 airline, climbed
2 percent to HK$18.62 because cheaper oil may lower fuel costs.  “The jobless claims data bolstered investor confidence
that there’s a sustained improvement in the labor market and
that the  U.S. economy  is moving towards a level of self-
sustaining economic recovery,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps
manage $1 billion at Pengana Capital Ltd. in  Melbourne . “The
immediate threat of stagflation due to rapidly rising oil prices
dissipated overnight as oil prices eased off recent highs.”  In Seoul, Korea Express Co. gained 8.1 percent to 113,000
won. Today is the deadline for letters of interest in buying a
controlling stake in the country’s largest logistics company.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.1 percent this year to
yesterday, compared with 5.8 percent for the S&P 500 and 2.8
percent for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Shares in the Asian
gauge trade at 13.9 times estimated earnings on average, versus
13.8 times for the S&P 500 and 11.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
