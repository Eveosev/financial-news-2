Benin, the West African nation meant
to hold a presidential election March 6, delayed the vote to
give more time to improve the register of voters, Marcel de
Souza, a spokesman for President Thomas Boni Yayi, said today.  “Government plans an extraordinary sitting this weekend to
choose a new date,” he told reporters in the commercial
capital, Cotonou.  To contact the reporter on this story:
