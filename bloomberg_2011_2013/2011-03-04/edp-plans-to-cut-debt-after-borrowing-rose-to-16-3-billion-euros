EDP-Energias de Portugal SA, the
country’s biggest power company, plans to cut debt after total
borrowing swelled to 16.3 billion euros ($23 billion) at the end
of 2010.  EDP is not assuming it will post any “meaningful or
material” capital gains from asset disposals this year, Chief
Financial Officer Nuno Alves said on a conference call today.
The company yesterday said it targets cash proceeds of 500
million euros from asset disposals in 2011.  The Lisbon-based company said in a presentation today that
it has 5.8 billion euros of cash and liquidity facilities
available, and that its funding needs over the next 24 months
are covered.  The former power monopoly’s debt increased as it invested
in dams and wind parks in  Europe ,  Brazil  and the U.S. to rely
less on fossil fuels while tapping government incentives for
alternative energy. EDP in November cut its average annual
investment target for 2011 and 2012 to 2.1 billion euros from an
earlier forecast of 2.4 billion euros.  EDP today said it plans to invest about 2.2 billion euros
in 2011 and 2 billion euros in 2012. It forecasts “low single
digit growth” in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization and in profit for 2011, according to a
presentation. EDP yesterday said full-year net income rose 5.4
percent to 1.08 billion euros.  Profit Forecast  The utility on May 20 forecast profit will rise annually by
an average 6 percent to 8 percent in the 2009-2012 period, while
Ebitda will climb 7 percent to 8 percent.  EDP in May forecast total installed capacity will increase
20 percent to 24.6 gigawatts in 2012, with wind projects and
hydropower plants accounting for 66 percent. A 1-megawatt plant
can supply about 1,000 average European homes. The company’s
installed capacity increased 7 percent to 22 gigawatts in 2010
and total output rose 9 percent, EDP said on Feb. 3.    EDP Renovaveis SA (EDPR) , the company’s renewable-energy division,
plans to install 0.8 gigawatts to 0.9 gigawatts of capacity a
year in 2011 and 2012.  EDP shares have climbed 12 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 10.2 billion euros. The  Portuguese
government  owns 20 percent of EDP and state-owned bank Caixa
Geral de Depositos SA holds 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
