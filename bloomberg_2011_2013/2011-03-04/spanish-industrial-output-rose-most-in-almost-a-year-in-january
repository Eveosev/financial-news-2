Spanish industrial production rose
in January by the most in almost a year as the recovery from an
almost two-year recession accelerated.  Output at factories, refineries and mines rose 3.8 percent
from a year earlier, adjusting for the number of working days,
after falling 0.1 percent in December, the National Statistics
Institute in Madrid said today in an e-mailed statement. That
was the most since March 2010.    Spain ’s economy is set to expand 1.3 percent this year, the
government has forecast, with exports leading the recovery.  Acerinox SA (ACX) , the world’s largest stainless steel producer, said
on Feb. 24 the first quarter will be stronger than the previous
three months, and  Tubos Reunidos SA (TRG) , a tube and pipe-maker, said
on Feb. 28 its factories are working at “full capacity.”  The euro region’s fourth-largest economy emerged from
recession in the first quarter of last year, before contracting
again in the three months through September as the deepest
austerity measures in at least three decades undermined domestic
demand. At the same time, unemployment remains the highest in  Europe , at 20.4 percent in January, according to the European
Union’s statistics office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
