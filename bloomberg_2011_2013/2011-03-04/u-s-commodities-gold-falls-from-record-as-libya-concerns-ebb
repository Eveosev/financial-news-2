Gold futures fell the most in six
weeks after Venezuela offered to mediate a resolution to the
crisis in  Libya . Silver had the biggest drop since late January.  The Arab League said it is weighing an offer by Venezuelan
President  Hugo Chavez  to mediate the civil conflict in Libya.
Yesterday, gold rose to a record of $1,441 an ounce as turmoil
in the Middle East, the world’s biggest oil-producing region,
boosted demand for an investment haven.  “Peace, if it happens, may be bearish for gold and
silver,” said  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of
the Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter. “It is time again
to head to the sidelines in gold and precious metals.”  In other markets, cotton rose for the fifth straight
session after a report showed increased export demand from the
U.S., the world’s largest shipper. Crude oil fell from a 29-
month high. The UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index
advanced 0.3 percent to 1,788.22. Earlier, the gauge reached
1,791.25, extending a rally to a record.  Gold futures for April delivery fell $21.30, or 1.5
percent, to settle at $1,416.40 on the Comex in  New York , the
biggest slide since Jan. 20. The metal has gained 24 percent in
the past year.  Silver futures for May delivery fell 50.8 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $34.327 an ounce, the biggest drop since Jan. 25.
Yesterday, the metal reached $34.975, the highest since March 7,
1980. That year, the price climbed to a record of $50.35. The
commodity has almost doubled in the past 12 months.  Cotton  Cotton for May delivery advanced 5.1 cents, or 2.5 percent,
to settle at $2.057 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Earlier, the price surged by the exchange limit of 7 cents. The
most-active contract has jumped 16 percent in five sessions
after falling 5.5 percent last week.  U.S. sales surged 56 percent to 403,341 bales in the week
ended Feb. 24 from a week earlier as shipments increased to  China ,  Turkey  and  Bangladesh , the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said today. Prices have more than doubled in the past 12 months
as global supplies trailed demand.  “China is busy trying to book as much cotton as it can,”
said  Mike Stevens , an independent trader in Mandeville,  Louisiana . “These numbers are terrific and show how much demand
was waiting for prices to dip.”  Crude Oil  Oil futures for April delivery slid 32 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $101.91 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  The  Associated Press  reported that Libyan army deserters
secured oil facilities in the rebel-held port of Brega on the
Gulf of Sidra. Forces loyal to Muammar Qaddafi briefly seized,
then lost control of, Brega yesterday.  “There are people attempting to come up with some kind of
compromise that would allow some kind of peace settlement, and
that’s definitely a bearish sign,” said  Michael Lynch , the
president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . The government’s failure to hold Brega “removed
any thought that there would be any damage to the oil exports,”
he said.  Commodities settled as follows:  April gold down $21.30 to $1,416.40 an ounce
