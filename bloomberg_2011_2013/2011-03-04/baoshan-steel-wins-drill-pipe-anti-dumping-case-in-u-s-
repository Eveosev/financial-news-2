Baoshan Iron & Steel Co.,  China ’s
biggest publicly traded steelmaker, won an anti-dumping case in
the U.S. over its shipments of drill pipes, the company said in
a  statement  on its Web site.  The U.S. commerce department ruled in August that the
company had a dumping rate of 7.64 percent, which was
subsequently lowered to 2.66 percent, the Shanghai-based
steelmaker said on March 2. Baosteel presented evidence to
refute the ruling and was exonerated, it said.  The U.S. is the world’s largest oil pipe market, according
to Baoshan. The U.S. market for drill pipes, which are high-end
oil pipe products, was controlled by U.S., European and Japanese
manufacturers until Baoshan became the first Chinese steelmaker
to export pipes to the U.S. in 1997, Baoshan said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
