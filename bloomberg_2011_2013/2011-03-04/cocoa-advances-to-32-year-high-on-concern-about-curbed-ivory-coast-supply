Cocoa rose to the highest price
since 1979 in New York on speculation escalating violence will
limit supplies from  Ivory Coast , the world’s largest producer.  The country’s ambassador to the  United Nations  appealed
yesterday for stronger action by the peacekeeping mission in
Ivory Coast to prevent violence. The nation is in the midst of a
standoff as incumbent President  Laurent Gbagbo  refuses to step
down in favor of  Alassane Ouattara , the internationally
recognized winner of a November election.  “With Ivory Coast on the brink of a civil war, cocoa
nearby values have rallied,” Rabobank International said in a
report late yesterday as it raised price forecasts for every
quarter of this year. “Supply risk is high.”  Cocoa for May delivery climbed $14, or 0.4 percent, to
$3,747 a metric ton at 7:31 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . Prices reached $3,775, the highest level for a most-active
contract since January 1979.  Nearer-dated futures trade above contracts with later dates
for all of 2011 in New York and London, a so-called
backwardation that may signal concern about supply. Rabobank
raised its average estimates for New York-traded cocoa in the
first through fourth quarters of this year to $3,400 a ton,
$3,000, $2,700 and $2,650.  “The deteriorating situation in Ivory Coast is expected to
result in reduced quality of beans in the short term and may
lower the coming harvest potential,” the bank said.  ‘Robust Mandate’  Cocoa for May delivery was unchanged at 2,396 pounds
($3,901) a ton on NYSE Liffe in  London  after adding as much as
1.2 percent to 2,425 pounds, the highest price for a most-active
contract since July 19.  Ambassador Youssoufou Bamba, who was appointed by Ouattara,
asked the UN Security Council to authorize a “more robust
mandate” for the 9,000 soldiers and civilian police deployed in
Ivory Coast. Security forces loyal to Gbagbo killed eight women
participating in a protest, a spokesman for an opposition group
supporting Ouattara said.  Arabica coffee for May delivery rose 0.7 percent to $2.767
a pound in New York. Robusta coffee for May delivery advanced
0.6 percent to $2,397 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Raw sugar for May delivery climbed 0.2 percent to 30.65
cents a pound on ICE. White, or refined, sugar for May delivery
gained 0.5 percent to $761 a ton in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
