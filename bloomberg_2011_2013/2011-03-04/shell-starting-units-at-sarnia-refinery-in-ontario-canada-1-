  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  is restarting
units at its Sarnia refinery in Ontario, Canada, after an
operational upset.  “We did have an operational upset this morning where some
of our units did come down,” Kristina Zimmer, a company
spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview.  There were no reported injuries or damage to the refinery,
according to Zimmer. The entire incident lasted about 90
minutes, she said.  The refinery has a capacity of about 75,000 barrels a day,
according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
