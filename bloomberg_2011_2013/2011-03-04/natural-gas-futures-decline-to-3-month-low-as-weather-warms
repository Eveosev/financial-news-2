Natural gas futures gained in  New
York  after dropping to the lowest in more than three months
on speculation that inventories will end the winter below the
five-year average.  Gas futures advanced as much as 1.2 percent as stockpiles
may be at a deficit to normal levels by the end of the heating
season on March 31, said Teri Viswanath, director of commodities
research at Credit Suisse in Houston.  Inventories  totaled 1.745
trillion for the week ended Feb. 25, 0.9 percent below the five-
year average and 0.5 percent less than the year-ago total.  “We’re seeing a little bit of selling fatigue,” Viswanath
said. “We’re still at the point where we’ll end the season at a
storage deficit.”  Natural gas for April delivery rose 1.5 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $3.793 per million British thermal units at 11:24
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The futures have
declined 14 percent this year. Gas slipped earlier to $3.731 per
million Btu, the lowest price since Nov. 15.  Stockpiles have been at a deficit to the five-year average
since Feb. 4. Inventories may total 1.651 trillion cubic feet at
the end of the winter heating season, down from 1.662 trillion a
year earlier, the Energy Department said Feb. 8 in its  Short-
Term Energy Outlook.   Heating Degree Days  Heating degree days, or days when the average temperature
is below 65 degrees Fahrenheit, may be 6 percent above the five-
year average next week, according to Frontier Weather in Tulsa,
Oklahoma.  Temperatures may be below-normal in parts of the Midwest
from March 9 through March 18, meteorologists led by  Matt Rogers 
at Commodity Weather Group in Bethesda,  Maryland , said in a note
to clients today.  The low temperature in Minneapolis on March 10 may be 14
degrees Fahrenheit (minus 10 Celsius), 7 below normal, according
to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania. The low in  Milwaukee  may be 24 degrees, 1 degree below normal.  Heating demand in the upper Midwest may be 14 percent above
normal on March 10, said  David Salmon , a meteorologist with
Weather Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri , in a note to clients
today.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
