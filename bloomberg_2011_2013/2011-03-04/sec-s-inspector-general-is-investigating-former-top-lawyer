H. David Kotz, inspector general of
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said he is
investigating former general counsel David M. Becker’s role in
the agency’s Bernard Madoff policies after Becker inherited
profits from his parents’ investment with the jailed financier.  Kotz said in an e-mail today that he was probing the
matter, which also has been the subject of inquiries to the SEC
from Republican lawmakers.  Becker, 63, and his brothers inherited about $2 million
from their parents’ Madoff account, which they liquidated after
their mother’s death in 2004. Irving H. Picard, the bankruptcy
court trustee unwinding Madoff’s business, said $1.5 million of
that is fraudulent profit and has filed a lawsuit to recover it
-- one of hundreds Picard has filed against banks and others to
claw back $100 billion of what he terms phony gains.  SEC Chairman  Mary Schapiro  “requested an inspector general
review to ensure an independent gathering and analysis of the
relevant facts,”  John Nester , an SEC spokesman, said today in a
telephone interview.  Becker has said that his work on Madoff matters was cleared
by the agency’s ethics counsel. He said his departure from the
agency last week was unrelated to Picard’s lawsuit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
