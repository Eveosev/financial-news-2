  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  said David Floyd
is resigning as worldwide president of DePuy Orthopaedics, the
maker of artificial hips and knees that has struggled with
product recalls and lawsuits over faulty implants.  Floyd, president of the unit since 2007, submitted his
resignation last week and will leave at the end of March, said a
spokeswoman, Lorie Gawreluk, in an e-mail. He is leaving to
“pursue interests outside the company,” she said, declining to
be more specific.  The DePuy division, which also makes spinal-care devices,
generated $5.59 billion in revenue last year for  New Brunswick ,
New Jersey-based J&J, the world’s largest maker of health-care
products. Sales of its hip and knee implants fell in last year’s
fourth quarter, hurt by a slowdown in medical procedures due to
economic weakness and the recalls, the company said in its Jan.
25 earnings statement.  DePuy Orthopaedics recalled the ASR XL Acetabular hip
system last August, after researchers found 13 percent of
patients needed a repeat operation, or “revision surgery,” to
fix problems with the implant. The company took a $280 million
charge in the fourth quarter to pay for the recall.  The company faces more than 500 lawsuits in state and
federal courts by patients who had the hip implants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
