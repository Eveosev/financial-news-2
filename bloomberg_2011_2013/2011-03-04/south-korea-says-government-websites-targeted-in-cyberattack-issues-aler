  South Korea  issued an alert against
cyber attacks after websites run by government agencies,
including the presidential office and the national intelligence
agency came under assault.  About 40 websites were targeted today at 10 a.m. local time
in an attack known as “distributed denial of service,” or
DDoS, and more incidents are likely around 6:30 p.m., according
to  Ahnlab Inc. (053800) , South Korea’s largest maker of antivirus
software. The government issued its third-highest alert against
cyber assaults and boosted monitoring of major websites, the
Korea Communications Commission said in a statement.  Today’s attacks are similar to attempts made in July 2009
to cripple dozens of websites in South Korea and the U.S. North
Korea’s postal ministry was responsible for the attacks, Won Sei Hoon, head of South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, told
lawmakers in October 2009.  Under the DDoS tactic, malicious codes infect computers to
trigger mass attacks against targeted websites, Ahnlab said in a
statement on its website. Today’s targets included the
presidential office, National Intelligence Service, foreign
ministry, defense ministry, national assembly and the U.S.
military in  Seoul , according to the statement.  Ahnlab said it is distributing free software to diagnose
and remove the malicious codes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
