The U.S. jobless rate unexpectedly
fell to 8.9 percent in February, the lowest in almost two years,
and employers added 192,000 jobs in a sign of growing confidence
in the recovery.  The increase in payrolls partly reflected a return to more
seasonable weather and followed a 63,000 gain in January, Labor
Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists was for an
addition of 196,000 jobs last month.  Manufacturing, construction and transportation were among
industries adding workers, underscoring Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s testimony to Congress this week that there are
“grounds for optimism” about improvements in the labor market.
Employment growth is giving Americans the means to keep spending
at retailers such as J.C. Penney Co. and  Macy’s Inc. (M)   “The economy has been clawing its way back up the side of
the mountain for the better part of a year and these numbers are
consistent with that,” Paul O’Neill, a special adviser to the
New York-based Blackstone Group LP and a former Treasury
Secretary, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.
“Where we are is the process of natural healing of our
economy.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.7 percent to
1,321.15 at 4 p.m. in New York on concern wage gains may not
keep up with rising energy prices. The yield on the benchmark
10-year Treasury note fell to 3.49 percent from 3.56 percent
late yesterday.  Unemployment Projections  The unemployment rate was projected to rise to 9.1 percent
from 9 percent, according to the survey median. The number of
unemployed fell by 190,000, and those employed rose by 250,000.
The size of the  labor force  increased by 60,000.  Some U.S. companies are ramping up hiring.  Intel Corp. (INTC) , the
world’s largest chipmaker, and  Home Depot Inc. (HD)  announced plans
last month to hire thousands of workers.  President  Barack Obama  last week told the first meeting of
his panel of outside economic advisers that the U.S. must deal
with stubbornly high unemployment even as the recovery is well
under way.  “We still have a ways to go,” Labor Secretary Hilda Solis
said in an interview today with Bloomberg Television. “We still
have a lot of people who need jobs.”  Last month’s increase in payrolls was the biggest since
May. If sustained, that pace would reduce the unemployment rate
to 6.9 percent by November 2012, when Obama faces re-election,
said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia. The rate was 7.8 percent
when Obama took office in January 2009.  Bernanke Comments  The labor market “has improved only slowly,” and it may
take “several years” for the  unemployment rate  to reach a
“more normal level,” Bernanke said March 1 during testimony
before the Senate Banking Committee.  Still, “we do see some grounds for optimism about the job
market over the next few quarters, including notable declines in
the unemployment rate in December and January, a drop in new
claims for  unemployment insurance , and an improvement in firms’
hiring plans,” Bernanke said.  Payroll estimates in a Bloomberg survey of 84 economists
ranged from gains of 100,000 to 297,000. January employment was
revised up from an initially reported gain of 36,000, while
December payrolls increased 152,000 after a previously reported
121,000 rise.  Private hiring, which excludes government agencies, rose by
222,000 in February, exceeding the 200,000 median forecast in
the Bloomberg survey. Private payroll gains averaged 145,000
during the first two months of the year, compared with 120,000
during the last half of 2010.  Government Payrolls  Government payrolls decreased by 30,000 last month,
reflecting cuts at the state and local level. Federal government
employment was unchanged.  Factory payrolls increased by 33,000, exceeding the survey
forecast of a 25,000 gain. A measure of the share of industries
showing job gains last month rose to 68.2, the highest since May
1998.  Orders to U.S. factories climbed in January by the most in
more than four years as demand for commercial aircraft rebounded
after slumping the previous month. Bookings for manufacturers’
goods rose 3.1 percent, the biggest gain since September 2006,
after a revised 1.4 percent increase in December, the Commerce
Department said today.  J.C. Penney, Macy’s and  Ross Stores Inc. (ROST)  were among
retailers yesterday reporting February same-store sales that
topped analysts’ estimates. Purchases at stores open at least a
year climbed 6.4 percent at J.C. Penney, 5.8 percent at Macy’s
and 3 percent at Ross, company data showed.  ‘Solid Start’  “We are encouraged by our solid start to the year,”
Michael Balmuth, chief executive officer of Pleasanton,
California-based discounter Ross Stores, said in a statement.
Even so, “the much more important March/April holiday selling
period is still ahead.”  Employment at service-providers rose 122,000. Construction
payrolls rose 33,000 and transportation and warehousing jobs
increased by 22,000. Retail trade employment declined 8,100.  A return to more seasonable temperatures helped boost
payrolls last month.  Nationwide, temperatures during the week of the February
employment survey were near normal, except for the central and
southern Great Plains, according to  National Weather Service .
Economists said a snowstorm that spread from the Midwest and the
South to  New England  during the prior month’s survey week likely
depressed January numbers as businesses temporarily closed.  Hourly Earnings  Weather may have also skewed figures for average hourly
earnings and the length of the workweek. Earnings averaged
$22.87 an hour last month, little changed after a 0.4 percent
jump in January. The average work week for all workers held at
34.2 hours.  “We believe that the workweek has been depressed by bad
weather in recent months and the unchanged wage rate in February
probably reflects a payback for an outsized gain” in January,  David Greenlaw , chief financial economist at Morgan Stanley in  New York , said in a note to clients.  The so-called underemployment rate -- which includes part-
time workers who’d prefer a full-time position and people who
want work but have given up looking -- decreased to 15.9
percent, the lowest since April 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
