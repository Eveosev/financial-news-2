  Thailand ’s baht advanced to the
strongest level in six weeks and interest-rate swaps completed a
sixth weekly gain on speculation the central bank will raise
borrowing costs next week to tame inflation.  Policy makers will lift the one-day bond repurchase rate by
a 25 basis points to 2.5 percent on March 9, according to 10 of
12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The core inflation index,
excluding fresh food and fuel, rose 1.45 percent in February,
from a 1.32 percent pace the previous month, data released March
1 show. Bank of Thailand Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said in
January that inflation is a key risk to the economy and the bank
will need to raise rates further this year.  “The governor of the central bank has made it clear
inflation is a key concern and I think they are going to hike
rates next week, which will give a little bit of support to the  Thai baht ,” said Chris Gothard, the Hong Kong-based head of
foreign-exchange business for Brown Brothers Harriman. “Given
that the authorities are particularly concerned about inflation
across the region, you can see swap rates continuing to rise.”  The baht strengthened 0.5 percent this week and 0.1 percent
today to 30.49 per dollar as of 3:24 p.m. in Bangkok, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 30.43
earlier today, the strongest level since Jan. 19. It may
appreciate to around 30 by the end of March, Gothard said.  The onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, climbed 7.5 basis points
from a week ago and 2.5 basis points from yesterday to 2.715
percent.  Bonds Advance  The Bank of Thailand lifted the policy rate at its last
meeting on Jan. 12 by 25 basis points to 2.25 percent and
signaled further increases.    Government bonds  had a third weekly advance. The yield on
the 3.125 percent debt due December 2015 fell three basis points
from Feb. 25 and was little changed from yesterday at 3.42
percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The finance ministry plans to sell inflation-linked bonds
for the first time in May to help investors preserve capital
amid accelerating inflation. The government will sell 40 billion
baht ($1.3 billion) of 10-year notes, possibly to both
institutional and individual investors, Chakkrit Parapuntakul,
director-general of the ministry’s Public Debt Management Office,
said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
