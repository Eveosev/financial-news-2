  Serbia  will again try to sell the
unprofitable flag carrier  JAT Airways  after splitting the
company in two and offering its marketable assets in a tender
later this year.  The government decided to split the airline in two in 
April last year, with one part continuing as a functioning 
airline and the other containing the liabilities.  Deloitte LLP will advise in the process that may end up
with the sale of a stake to a strategic partner, Deputy
Infrastructure Minister Miodrag Miljkovic said today as he
signed an agreement with Deloitte representatives in Belgrade.  Serbia twice failed to sell JAT, in 2007 and 2008, and
merger talks with Turkish Airlines remain inconclusive.
Miljkovic declined to comment on possible buyers, saying only
that the tender should be published by July, after Deloitte
completes an assessment of the company and other preparations.  JAT’s fleet of 10 Boeing 737-300s and four turboprop ATR
72-200s flies to 32 destinations. The company recorded 2009
operating revenue of 12.1 billion dinars ($153.26 million) and a
net loss of $11.64 million.  Serbia’s parliament approved in November government
guarantees to  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  for a 51.5
million-euro ($71.9 million) loan to JAT to rejuvenate the fleet
and service debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
