U.K. stocks declined as data in the
U.S. signalled growth in wages may fail to keep up with surging
energy costs, even as the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly
decreased.    WPP Plc (WPP)  lost 2.6 percent as the world’s biggest advertising
agency said that sales will fail to grow faster in 2011.  Serco
Group Plc (SRP)  rallied 4.6 percent after Bank of America Corp.
advised buying the shares of  London ’s Docklands Light Railway
operator. Weir Group Plc advanced 1.1 percent after UBS AG added
the shares to its ‘First XI’ stock list.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  lost 14.70 points, or 0.2
percent, to 5,990.39 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge
has climbed 1.5 percent this year amid better-than-estimated
corporate earnings and indications the global economy is
gathering strength. The  FTSE All-Share Index (ASX)  lost 0.1 percent
today and Ireland’s ISEQ Index slid 0.2 percent.  “The market has got a little ahead of itself and was
pricing in a much higher payrolls number than we got,” said  Michael Hewson , an analyst at CMC Markets in London. “There’s a
lot of skittishness, especially with what’s happening in the
Middle East.”  Average hourly earnings were unchanged in February, Labor
Department data showed. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had
forecast 0.2 percent growth. The data offset a 192,000 increase
in payrolls and an unexpected decline in the unemployment rate
to 8.9 percent.  WPP lost 2.6 percent to 814.5 pence as the world’s biggest
advertising agency said that sales will fail to grow faster in
2011.  Serco rallied 4.6 percent to 618.5 pence as Bank of America
upgraded the shares to “buy” from “neutral.”  Weir gained 1.1 percent to 1,790 pence as the shares
replaced HSBC Holdings Plc in the Swiss bank’s ‘First XI list’
of preferred stocks.    Bodycote Plc (BOY)  rallied 5.1 percent to 325 pence, for the
second-biggest advance on the FTSE 250 Index. Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc upgraded the shares to “buy” from “hold.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
