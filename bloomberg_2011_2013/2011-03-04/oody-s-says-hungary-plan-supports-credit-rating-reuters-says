Hungary’s fiscal plan unveiled this
week supports rating the country’s debt at the lowest investment
grade and remaining risks justify keeping the outlook negative,
Moody’s analyst  Dietmar Hornung  said, according to Reuters.  “I see the announcement as being supportive for the
current rating, but there are two main risks with the fiscal
package, which need to be monitored,” Reuters cited Hornung as
saying in an interview. “First is the implementation risk,
whether the government is able and willing to implement the
measures that are needed to achieve the adjustment as proposed.
Second, the growth risk.”  The negative outlook reflects a "certain balance" of risks,
Hornung said, according to Reuters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
