Manchester United manager  Alex
Ferguson  will appeal improper conduct charges filed against him
by the Football Association for his comments about the referee
after a 2-1 loss to Chelsea earlier this week.  Ferguson was charged with improper conduct after he
criticized official  Martin Atkinson  in post-match interviews
with Unitedâ€™s television channel. The referee gave a penalty
that allowed Chelsea to take the lead in the March 1 soccer
match.  The Football Association charged the manager yesterday
after the comments were aired.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
