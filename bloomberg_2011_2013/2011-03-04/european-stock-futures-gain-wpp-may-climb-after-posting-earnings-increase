European stocks fell after U.S.
wages failed to keep pace with a surge in energy costs and oil
climbed as investors speculated that pro-democracy protests in
North Africa will spread to the Arabian peninsula.  Carrefour SA, the world’s second-largest retailer, slid 4.4
percent after Citigroup Inc. advised investors to sell the
shares.  WPP Plc (WPP)  declined 2.6 percent after posting sales growth
that failed to match its competitors.  SBM Offshore NV (SBMO) , the
world’s biggest producer of floating oil rigs, jumped 6.3
percent after earnings beat analysts’ projections.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index declined 0.6 percent
to 281.87 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London . The measure lost 0.8
percent this week as concern that popular protests will spread
to  Saudi Arabia  offset better-than-estimated corporate earnings
and signs that the global economy is strengthening.  Stocks erased earlier gains today after a U.S. Labor
Department report said average hourly earnings failed to grow in
February. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had forecast 0.2
percent growth.  U.S. employers added 192,000 workers in February, amid an
improving economy and more seasonable weather. The gain in
payrolls followed a 63,000 increase in January and compared with
the 196,000 median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News. The  unemployment rate  unexpectedly declined to 8.9
percent, the lowest level since April 2009.  Oil Increase  “The quality of the jobs report isn’t exceptional,” said
Benoit de Broissia, an analyst at KBL Richelieu in Paris, which
oversees $4.1 billion. “The average salary isn’t growing. The
data wasn’t a very big surprise. It’s sufficient, but some
expected better. The market needs to take a breath. Oil gaining
also explains declines in stocks. The situation still isn’t
clear in the Middle East and North Africa.”  Oil rose to a 29-month high in  New York , as forces loyal to
Libyan ruler Muammar Qaddafi attacked key towns in the east of
the country and fought with protesters in the capital Tripoli.  The Stoxx 600 pared its gains yesterday after European
Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet signaled that the ECB
may raise  interest rates  next month, sparking a selloff in
Spanish stocks.  National benchmark indexes slid in 12 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  slipped 0.2 percent,
Germany’s  DAX Index (DAX)  lost 0.7 percent and France’s  CAC 40 Index (CAC) 
sank 1 percent.  Carrefour Slips  Carrefour tumbled 4.4 percent to 32.26 euros, for a weekly
loss of 9.2 percent. The stock was cut to “sell” from “hold”
at Citigroup, which cited the “gloomy post financial year 2010
results outlook and the value-destructive spinoffs announced.”
The brokerage cut its price forecast to 30 euros from 37 euros.  WPP declined 2.6 percent to 814.5 pence after the world’s
biggest advertising agency reported an increase in 2010 sales
that failed to keep pace with the rate of growth reported by
rival Publicis Groupe SA. WPP also said that earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization increased to 1.44
billion pounds ($2.34 billion) in 2010, exceeding the average
estimate for Ebitda of 1.4 billion pounds in a Bloomberg survey
of analysts.  SBM Offshore soared 6.3 percent to 19.49 euros. The company
posted full-year earnings before interest and taxes of $362
million, exceeding the average estimate for Ebit of $319 million
in a Bloomberg survey of 16 analysts.  Areva Climbs    Areva SA (CEI)  jumped 5 percent to 35.23 euros after the biggest
supplier of nuclear fuel and services’ Chief Executive Officer  Anne Lauvergeon  said the company doesn’t need to raise extra
funds, following last year’s capital increase. Areva also
scrapped its dividend payout for 2010 and reported full-year
profit that missed estimates because of charges. Net income rose
60 percent to 883 million euros ($1.23 billion), less than the
1.06 billion-euro estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.    Veolia Environnement SA (VIE)  lost 3.7 percent to 22.15 euros as
the world’s largest water utility said 2010 net profit fell to
581.1 million euros from a restated 584.1 million euros in 2009.
The company pledged to sell 4 billion euros of assets over three
years after posting the unexpected drop in full-year profit.  Cie. Nationale a Portefeuille SA soared 19 percent to 48.15
euros, the largest gain on the Stoxx 600, after Belgian
billionaire  Albert Frere  and  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA, France’s largest
bank, offered 1.5 billion euros to buy out minority investors in
the investment company.    Devgen (DEVG) , Legrand  Devgen NV surged 5.9 percent to 5.72 euros after the
Belgian developer of hybrid rice, sunflower, sorghum and pearl
millet seeds said that its loss narrowed in 2010 to 7.1 million
euros from 8.5 million euros in 2009. The company predicted
“significant” growth in sales and profit at its seeds business
in 2011, and said it’s confident it can finance its operations
for the next few years.    Legrand SA (LR)  slid 5.3 percent to 28.70 euros, the largest
drop on the Stoxx 600. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Wendel
sold stakes in the world’s largest maker of electrical switches
before the expiry of an agreement not to do so. The pair sold 40
million shares, or 15 percent of the company, at 28.75 euros
apiece, according to two people familiar with the sale.  Wendel (MF) ’s
shares were little changed at 72.75 euros as it said it made a
430 million-euro profit from the sale of its 8.3 percent stake
in Legrand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
