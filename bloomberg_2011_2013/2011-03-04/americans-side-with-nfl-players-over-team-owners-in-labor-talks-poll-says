Americans are siding with National
Football League players over team owners in their labor dispute,
a poll found.  The public favor players by 35 percent to 22 percent,
according to the Seton Hall University Sports Poll. In a
February survey, 21 percent said they backed the players and 18
percent supported the league. A third of those polled said a
possible lockout would impact the 2011 season, an increase of 10
percent over three weeks ago.  “This is a battle of millionaires vs. billionaires and
not a traditional labor dispute,”  Rick Gentile , director of the
poll, said in a statement. “It appears the public will blame
the owners more than the players if there is a work stoppage, in
keeping with the nationwide sentiment against management.”  The owners and the NFL Players’ Association today agreed to
extend talks on a labor contract for one day, delaying a
possible lockout for at least 24 hours.  A majority of those polled said they believe the owners’
claim that the players are paid too much; that the players
should be allowed to see the owners’ financial records; that the
U.S. government should stay out the discussions; and that the
league should be prohibited from collecting television fees if
there is a lockout.  The random telephone poll surveyed 786 Americans and has a
margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
