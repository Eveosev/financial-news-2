Asian stocks rose for the fourth day
this week after fewer Americans filed unemployment claims and
oil prices eased for the first time in three days.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, climbed
1.9 percent in Tokyo as the dollar strengthened against the yen,
boosting the outlook for Japanese export earnings. Canon Inc.,
the world’s No. 1 maker of cameras, advanced 3.2 percent.  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  increased 1.4 percent in Sydney after copper rose
to a two-week high in  London  yesterday.  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) ,  Australia ’s largest gold producer, jumped 4.7 percent after
almost doubling the estimated size of a gold deposit in Papua
New Guinea.  “Reduced unemployment claims in America add to confidence
that the U.S. is on the verge of much stronger employment growth
that will make its recovery self sustaining,” said  Shane Oliver ,
Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP Capital
Investors Ltd., which manages about $93 billion. “That’s great
news for Asian exports. Lower oil prices potentially mean less
of a threat to Asian inflation and economic growth.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 1.2 percent to 139.55 at
12:22 p.m. in Tokyo. It has gained 2 percent this week, on
course for the highest close since Feb. 21. The gauge retreated

East and North  Africa  may jeopardize a global economic recovery.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 1.6 percent.  South

200 Index gained 1.1 percent.  U.S. Employment  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
today. The index climbed 1.7 percent yesterday in  New York , the
most in three months, after the Labor Department said
applications for  unemployment benefits  fell by 20,000 to 368,000
in the week ended Feb. 26. Economists had forecast a gain to
395,000. The total number of Americans receiving unemployment
benefits fell to the lowest level since October 2008.  In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management’s
index of non-manufacturing businesses climbed to 59.7, the
highest level since August 2005. Economists had forecast a drop
to 59.3. A reading above 50 signals growth in the service sector.  “There should be some buying across the board,” said
Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings
Inc. “The yen is weakening,  oil prices  have taken a breather
and you’ve got some better economic data.”  Toyota, Canon  Toyota climbed 1.9 percent to 3,810 yen in Tokyo and Canon

No. 1 maker of memory-chip testers, gained 3.1 percent to 1,725
yen.  The yen depreciated to 115.17 against the euro from 113.58

level since Nov. 4, after European Central Bank President Jean- Claude Trichet said the ECB may raise  interest rates  next month
to counter accelerating inflation.  Against the dollar, Japan’s currency weakened to 82.52, a
level not seen since Feb. 24, from 81.88. A weaker yen boosts
the value of overseas income at Japanese companies when
converted into their home currency.    BHP Billiton , the world’s biggest mining company, gained
1.4 percent to A$47.21 in Sydney and Rio Tinto Group, the third
largest, rose 1.6 percent to A$85.58 after copper rose for a
second straight day in London yesterday.  Crude oil for April delivery dropped 0.3 percent to settle
at $101.91 a barrel in New York yesterday after Venezuela

deserters secured oil facilities in the rebel-held port of Brega
on the Gulf of Sidra.  Newcrest Surges       Newcrest surged 4.7 percent to A$40.02. Drilling results at
Wafi Golpu in Morobe Province included a revised exploration
target to more than 30 million ounces of gold and 8 million
metric tons of copper, compared with an earlier target of 16
million ounces of gold and 4.9 million tons of copper, Newcrest
said in a presentation prior to a global investor roadshow in
March.  In  Seoul , Korea Express Co. gained 8.2 percent to 113,000
won. Today is the deadline for letters of interest in buying a
controlling stake in the country’s largest logistics company.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.1 percent this year to
yesterday, compared with 5.8 percent for the S&P 500 and 2.8
percent for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Shares in the Asian
gauge trade at 13.9 times estimated earnings on average, versus
