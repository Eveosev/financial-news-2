The cocoa-industry regulator in  Ghana , the world’s second-biggest grower of the chocolate
ingredient, said it is concerned that “unscrupulous persons” are
encouraging farmers to spray “anointing oil” on their crop to
boost yields.  “These persons who claim to be ‘prophets’ and ‘pastors’
are using local FM stations and information centers in the
cocoa-growing areas to misinform our hardworking cocoa
farmers,” the  Ghana Cocoa Board  said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Ghana, which neighbors the world’s biggest grower  Ivory
Coast , encourages farmers to increase the use of pesticide,
fungicide and fertilizer to control crop diseases in a bid to
raise output to 1 million metric tons of beans by 2012.  The Accra-based board, known as Cocobod, also urged farmers
to report people who promote the use of religious ointments on
cocoa trees to the country’s security agencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
