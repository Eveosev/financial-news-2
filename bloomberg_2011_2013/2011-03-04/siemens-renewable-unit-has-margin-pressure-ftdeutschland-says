  Siemens AG (SIE) ’s renewable-energy unit
faces margin pressure on increasing competition and slowing
demand,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing Rene
Umlauft, head of the division.  Entering  China ’s wind market is especially difficult and
expensive, the newspaper said. The Munich-based company is
opening a wind-turbine factory and setting up a distribution
network in China, which hurts margins, the newspaper cited
Umlauft as saying.  The renewable-energy unit posted a 4.2 percent profit
margin in the quarter ended in September compared with an
average of 12 percent for the company as a whole, FTD said.
Siemens is targeting a 10 percent share of the wind market in
China, which is still dominated by domestic producers, the
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
