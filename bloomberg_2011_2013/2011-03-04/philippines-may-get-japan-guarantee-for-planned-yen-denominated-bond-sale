The  Philippines ’ planned 15-year
yen-denominated bond may be backed by the  Japan Bank for
International Cooperation  when it’s sold in the first half of
this year, Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said today.  A senior official at Japan’s finance ministry “expressed
full support to the possibility for us to issue Samurai” after
a meeting yesterday, Purisima said in Bacolod City today.
“Fifteen years is the minimum tenor the Philippines is asking
for,” he said.  The Philippines hasn’t sold yen bonds with maturities of
more than 10 years. The plan is to sell at least $500 million of
the debt, Purisima said last month. The government sold 100
billion yen ($1.2 billion) of 10-year notes in Japan in the
first quarter of 2010 and 50 billion yen of the securities come
due in December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Southeast Asian nation is seeking to boost economic
growth to as much as 8 percent this year and increase spending
to a record. The $161 billion economy expanded 7.3 percent in
2010, the most since 1976.  The government plans to raise $2.5 billion from the sale of
overseas debt this year to fund a  budget deficit  that’s
projected to narrow to about 300 billion pesos ($6.9 billion)
from an estimated 310 billion pesos last year. The Philippines
sold $1.25 billion of 25-year peso bonds to global investors in
January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
