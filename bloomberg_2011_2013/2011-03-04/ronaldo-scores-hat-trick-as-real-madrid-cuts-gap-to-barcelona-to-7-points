Cristiano Ronaldoscored three
second-half goals as Real  Madrid  routed Malaga 7-0 to cut the
gap on Spanish league leader Barcelona back to seven points.  Madrid led 3-0 at halftime at its Santiago Bernabeu stadium
last night on goals by  Karim Benzema , Angel Di Maria and
Marcelo. Ronaldo scored in the 50th, 67th and 76th minutes to
join Lionel Messi on a league-leading 27 goals before leaving
the game with a hamstring injury.  Benzema also scored in the 61st minute as Real recorded its
biggest win under coach  Jose Mourinho  to move to 64 points
through 26 of 38 games. Two-time defending champion Barcelona
has 71 points following its 1-0 win at Valencia two days ago.  “We have to work more because the championship isn’t over
yet,” Benzema told Real’s website. “We have to keep winning in
order to catch up with the leaders.”  Barcelona hosts Real Zaragoza tomorrow, while Real visits
Racing Santander in two days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
