The U.S.  Justice Department  is
probing MPEG LA, the owner of online video patents, over
antitrust concerns regarding claims against  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s VP8,
the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified people.  MPEG LA has called for companies to submit patents which may
be infringed by VP8, which Google has released under a royalty-
free open license, according to the report. MPEG LA didn’t
confirm or deny the probe, the WSJ said.     To contact the editor responsible for this story:
