The Basel III rules on bank capital
may penalize  Europe â€™s diversified universal banks, most of which
proved resilient throughout the financial crisis, said Jacques de Larosiere, a former governor of the Bank of  France  and the
president of Eurofi, a policy review group dedicated to
financial services.  Writing in the Financial Times, de Larosiere said universal
banks, with portfolios that include both retail and corporate
lending, project finance, investment banking and fund
management, usually keep loans on their balance sheets and do
little in the way of securitization.  This model suits the way the European economy is financed,
which is mainly through bank intermediation, he said.  The need for universal banks to increase their own funds
significantly will have two consequences: credit will become
more expensive and there will be a tendency to reduce lending
and to shorten lending horizons, de Larosiere said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
