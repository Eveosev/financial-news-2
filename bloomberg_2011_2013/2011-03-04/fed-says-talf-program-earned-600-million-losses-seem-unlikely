The  Federal Reserve ’s Term Asset-
Backed Securities Loan Facility has generated interest income of
almost $600 million and risk controls are likely to prevent
future losses, a Fed official said.  “The experience to date suggests that the multiple risk
controls built into the TALF program have been effective and
losses appear unlikely,” said William R. Nelson, deputy
director, division of monetary affairs. “In conclusion, we
believe that the TALF program represents a very successful use
of TARP funds,” he said, referring to government bailout funds.  The Fed program helped to restart the asset-backed  securities market  when credit was tight, Nelson told the
Congressional Oversight Panel for the Troubled Asset Relief
Program in testimony in  Washington .  “Its careful design has protected the taxpayer, and in the
end, the program almost certainly will return a net profit to
the Treasury,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
