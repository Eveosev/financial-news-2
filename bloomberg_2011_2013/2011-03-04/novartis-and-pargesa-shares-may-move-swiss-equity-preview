Swiss stocks declined, led by banks,
as government data in the U.S. signaled that growth in wages may
fail to keep up with surging energy costs even as the
unemployment rate unexpectedly decreased.    UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , the nation’s biggest
banks, fell more than 2 percent.  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the world second-
largest biggest cement maker, rose 0.9 percent.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  of the largest and most actively
traded companies sank 1 percent to 6,530.54 at the 5:30 p.m.
close in Zurich, bringing this week’s drop to 0.1 percent. The
gauge is still 1.5 percent higher this year as investors
speculated that the global economic recovery is gaining
momentum. The broader Swiss Performance Index retreated 0.8
percent today.  Average hourly earnings were unchanged in February, U.S.
Labor Department data showed. Economists in a Bloomberg survey
had forecast 0.2 percent growth. The data offset a 192,000
increase in payrolls and an unexpected decline in the  unemployment rate  to 8.9 percent.  UBS slid 2.8 percent to 17.96 Swiss francs and Credit
Suisse lost 2.7 percent to 40.92 francs.  Holcim climbed 0.9 percent to 69.1 francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
