Sony Pictures Home Entertainment
Inc. joined a group of other movie companies in complaining that
video-rental chain  Blockbuster Inc. (BLOAQ)  isn’t paying them for
merchandise.  Blockbuster isn’t paying what it owes under a revenue-
sharing agreement for DVDs leased to it and will owe more than
$5.5 million during the next several months, Sony said in a
filing today with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.  “Blockbuster’s latest actions indicate that there is at
least a significant risk, if not a complete certainty, that
Blockbuster will not turn over the revenue,” Sony said.  In addition to Sony, the  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) , Universal Studios
Home Entertainment LLC, and  Twentieth Century Fox Home
Entertainment LLC  have said in court filings that Blockbuster
hasn’t paid for merchandise they shipped. Sony is seeking a
court order requiring Blockbuster to sequester money generated
by the rental and sale of Sony’s DVDs.  Blockbuster, which filed for bankruptcy in September, is
planning to auction its assets.  Martin Sosland , an attorney for
the company, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment.  The case is In re Blockbuster, 10-14997,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
