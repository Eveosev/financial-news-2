  Vietnam ’s government bonds fell this
week, pushing the yield on benchmark five-year notes to a nine-
month high, as concern inflation will gather pace curbed demand
for fixed-income assets. The dong strengthened.  The yield on five-year notes climbed five basis points to
11.63 percent, the highest level since June 7, according to a
daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The rate was
11.53 percent yesterday. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said March 2 that fighting
inflation was now the “top priority.” The  State Bank  of
Vietnam lifted its seven-day reverse repurchase rate, or what it
charges commercial banks in daily open-market operations, to 12
percent from 11 percent on Feb. 22. The government raised
domestic fuel prices by as much as 24 percent in February, when
inflation hit a two-year high of 12.3 percent, and electricity
tariffs increased more than 15 percent this month.  “Investors’ inflationary expectations are higher,” said
Nguyen Tan Thang, head of fixed-income research at Ho Chi Minh
City Securities Corp. “The domestic price of oil, the price of
electricity, it’s all going up.”  The dong strengthened 0.17 percent this week to 20,835 per
dollar, according to prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg. It
gained 0.14 percent today. The central bank fixed the  reference
rate  at 20,663, compared with 20,658 yesterday, its website
showed. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of that rate.  In the so-called black market, the dong traded at 21,730 to
21,780 at gold shops as of 3 p.m. in Hanoi, compared with 21,650
to 21,730 yesterday, according to a telephone information
service run by state-owned Vietnam Posts & Telecommunications.  --Nick Heath. Editors:  James Regan , Andrew Janes  To contact the reporter on this story:
