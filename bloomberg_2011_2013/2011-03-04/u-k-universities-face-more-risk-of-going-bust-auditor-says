U.K. universities face an increased
risk of going bust under new funding arrangements, according to
a report by government auditors today that urged greater
scrutiny of institutions’ accounts.  The  National Audit Office  said 9 percent of universities
had been in deficit in at least two out of the last three years.
A new funding mechanism set out by former BP Plc Chief Executive
Officer  John Browne , under which students borrow more and pay
higher fees, with less money coming from central government,
increases the uncertainty in funding streams, the spending
watchdog said.  Margaret Hodge, the opposition  Labour Party  lawmaker who
chairs Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee, which scrutinizes
NAO reports, said the Higher Education Funding Council for  England  needed to respond with increased reporting of
institutions’ financial situations. The council is responsible
for distributing public funds to universities and colleges.  “The Funding Council is not transparent enough about its
risk assessments of individual institutions,” Hodge said in an
e-mailed statement. “Students deserve to know if the place they
choose to study at has a high risk of failing, particularly in
the brave new world where the student holds the purse strings.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
