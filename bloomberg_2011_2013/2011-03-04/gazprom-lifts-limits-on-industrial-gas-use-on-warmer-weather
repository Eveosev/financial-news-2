OAO Gazprom lifted limits on
natural-gas use by Russian industrial consumers yesterday
because of warmer weather, a press official at the Moscow-based
company said by phone today.  The limits were in place in 45 of the country’s regions,
Gazprom said. Russia’s largest gas producer had asked industrial
consumers to partially switch to other fuels from Feb. 15 as gas
demand from households increased on colder weather earlier last
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
