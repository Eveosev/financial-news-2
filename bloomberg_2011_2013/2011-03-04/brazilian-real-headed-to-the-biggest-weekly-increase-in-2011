  Brazil ’s real headed to the biggest
weekly gain this year as increased investor confidence in global
economic growth boosted demand for emerging-market currencies.  The real gained 1.2 percent this week to 1.6430 per  U.S.
dollar  at 1:09 p.m. New York time, from 1.6630 on Feb. 25. It
increased 0.4 percent today. Twenty-three of 25 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg gained against the dollar this
week.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke testified before
the U.S. Congress this week that there are “grounds for
optimism” about the country’s labor market in coming months.
Initial jobless claims declined last week to the lowest level
since May 2008, the U.S. Labor Department said yesterday. The  unemployment rate  in the world’s biggest economy fell to 8.9
percent in February, the lowest level in almost two years,
according to data released today by that department.  “The markets are optimistic in general,” said Reginaldo Galhardo, a foreign exchange manager at Treviso Corretora, a Sao
Paulo-based brokerage. “The U.S. data came in good.”  The real strengthened this week even as the central bank
bought dollars in the forward and spot currency market, and made
bets against the real in  futures markets  as part of an effort to
curb the appreciation of the currency. The real has gained 41
percent since the end of 2008, the most among emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg during that period.  Policy makers said they bought an unspecified amount of
dollars today in the forward  currency market  at 1.6538 reais
each for liquidation on April 4. The central bank also said it
purchased the U.S. currency in the spot market for 1.6464 each.  The yield on the interest-rate futures contract due in
January 2012 rose 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
12.56 percent. The yield on the contract has fallen 5 basis
points this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
