  Hero Honda Motors Ltd. (HH) ’s Indian
founders pledged a part of their stake in the nation’s biggest
motorcycle maker as they prepare to buy out partner Honda Motor
Co. from the venture.  Hero Investments Pvt. pledged 10.6 million shares with
IL&FS Trust Co. on March 1, according to a filing to the Bombay
Stock Exchange today. The 5.3 percent stake is worth 16.3
billion rupees ($362 million) based on Hero Honda’s share price
at the close of trading in Mumbai today.    India  last month referred a proposal by Hero Investments to
raise 45 billion rupees from overseas investors to the Cabinet
Committee on Economic Affairs. Hero Group, controlled by the
Munjal family, agreed to buy Honda’s 26 percent stake in the New
Delhi-based company in December as the Japanese automaker works
to expand business at its fully owned unit in the nation.  Ravi Sud, chief financial officer of  Hero Honda , wasn’t
immediately available when called on his mobile phone. Hero
Group’s New Delhi-based spokesman Ashwani Sharma declined to
immediately comment. A call to the office phone of Sachin Gupta,
CEO of IL&FS Trust, wasn’t answered.  Hero Honda rose 2 percent to 1,536.80 rupees at the 3:30
p.m. close of trading in Mumbai. The shares have declined 23
percent this year.  Hero Investments held a 17.3 percent stake in Hero Honda as
of December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
