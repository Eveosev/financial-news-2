Hungary’s new constitution is being
drafted on  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad, Jozsef Szajer, a ruling party
lawmaker in the European Parliament, said in a  blog post .    Steve Jobs  will surely be happy when he gets word that
Hungary’s new constitution is being written on an iPad, actually
my iPad,” Szajer said in a post, adding that it was the first
constitution in the world to be written on the device. “The
best is I don’t have to wait for minutes to turn it on, like
with a normal laptop. I can open it anywhere and can take
advantage of every minute. It’s a miracle!”  Szajer wrote the post on March 1, the day before Jobs,
Apple’s chief executive officer, unveiled the iPad 2, which is
thinner than its predecessor and features a faster chip as well
as front and rear cameras.  Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  has set an April
deadline to approve the constitution. Two of the three
opposition parties in Parliament are boycotting the
constitutional process, citing ruling party lawmakers’
unwillingness to compromise on issues.  Orban’s Fidesz party and its junior coalition partners, the  Christian Democrats , have a two-thirds parliamentary majority,
enough to approve the constitution without opposition support.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
