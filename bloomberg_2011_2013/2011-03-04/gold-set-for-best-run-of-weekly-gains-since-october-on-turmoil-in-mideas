Gold may gain in New York, extending
the longest weekly run in more than three years, as turmoil in  Libya  and concern inflation will accelerate boost demand for an
alternative investment.  Libyan opposition leaders rejected a mediation offer by
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez as armed rebels fought for
control of oil ports on the country’s central and eastern
coastal strip. Gold fell the most in six weeks yesterday after
reaching a record $1,441 an ounce on March 2.  “The situation in the Middle East and North Africa is
really tense and there’s a lot of uncertainty,” said Bernard Sin, the head of currency and metal trading at MKS Finance SA, a
bullion refiner in Geneva. While there’s been “haven” buying,
“physical demand has slowed down a little bit” because of
higher prices, he said.  Gold futures for April delivery rose $2.10, or 0.1 percent,
to $1,418.50 an ounce at 8 a.m. on the Comex in  New York .
They’re up 0.7 percent this week, set for a sixth weekly
advance, the longest run since September 2007. The metal for
immediate delivery in London was 0.2 percent higher at
$1,418.28.  Gold fell to $1,418 an ounce in the morning “fixing” in
London, used by some mining companies to sell output, from
$1,421.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  Futures slipped 1.5 percent yesterday as the  Arab League 
held talks with  Venezuela  about Chavez’s call for a “mediation
commission.” Opposition spokesman Mustafa Gheriani said “we do
not accept any negotiations” with Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi, according to the  Associated Press .  Toppled Leaders  Concern about rising inflation and currency debasement
drove gold prices up 30 percent last year for a 10th annual
gain. Asian countries from  China  to  Indonesia  raised  interest
rates  this year to curb rising consumer prices. Increasing food
and commodity prices have contributed to unrest that toppled
leaders in Tunisia and Egypt, with protests also erupting in
Yemen, Bahrain, Oman, Jordan, Algeria, Morocco, Iran and Iraq.  As oil has climbed above $100 a barrel in New York,
mounting inflation pressures in  Europe  prompted European Central
Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet yesterday to say the ECB may
raise rates next month for the first time in almost three years.  “Why on earth would anyone sell gold now, with the Middle
East situation still very uncertain, and all the monetary
reasons to hold gold still intact?” said Adrian Day, president
of Adrian Day Asset Management. “Inflation is slowly rising.”  Silver for May delivery in New York was up 0.3 percent at
$34.44 an ounce after climbing to $34.975 on March 2, the
highest price since March 7, 1980. That year futures reached a
record $50.35.  Palladium for June delivery fell 0.6 percent to $810.20 an
ounce. It touched a 10-year high of $863.70 on Feb. 22. Platinum
for April delivery was 0.1 percent lower at $1,830.30 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
