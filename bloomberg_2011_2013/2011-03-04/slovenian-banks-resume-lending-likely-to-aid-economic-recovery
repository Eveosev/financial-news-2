Slovenian banks resumed lending at
the start of the year, a move that will likely support the
nascent economic recovery after lenders stopped giving out new
loans a month before, the government’s  economic institute  said.  “Credit activity in Slovenia strengthened in January from
the month earlier as companies took out new loans,” the
government’s forecasting institute said in an e-mail today.
“Exposure of the banking system to borrowing from abroad
remained at one-third of total assets, which signals still-high
pressure on the liquidity of the banking system.”  Companies in the euro-region member repaid some 400 million
euros ($559 million) of debt last year, while banks settled a
total of 1.5 billion euros of loans and deposits in 2010, the
institute said.  Slovenia’s economy is recovering as demand for its exported
goods in  Europe  improves. Gross domestic product last year
advanced 1.2 percent after dropping the most among the euro
region nations a year earlier. GDP is forecast to expand an
annual 2.5 percent this year, according to the institute’s
forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
