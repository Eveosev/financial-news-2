German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
the prospect of a European Central Bank interest-rate increase
would have no effect on efforts to solve the euro debt crisis.  “Irrespective of the questions of the ECB and  interest
rates , we know that we have to put a joint package for the euro
on the table,” Merkel said at a joint press conference in
Berlin today after talks with Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean- Claude Juncker. “That has nothing to do with the question of
interest rates.”  When asked how the threat of higher borrowing costs in the
euro region might affect work on a so-called “comprehensive”
package to solve the debt crisis, Juncker said he never comments
on “rate announcements or quasi-announcements.”  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said yesterday that an
April rate increase was “possible.” As a month-end European
Union summit nears, a looming rate increase leaves authorities
under greater pressure to settle spats over ways to fix the
crisis and ensure future budget discipline, economists said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
