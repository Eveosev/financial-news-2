  New York Islanders  forward Trevor Gillies has been suspended for 10 games by the  National Hockey
League  for a hit to the head he delivered in his first game
following a nine-game suspension, the team said on its website.  The second suspension stems from Gillies’s hit on Minnesota
Wild forward Cal Clutterbuck in the second period of the
Islanders’ 4-1 victory two days ago. Gillies was ejected from
the game after checking Clutterbuck into the boards from behind.  Gillies will forfeit $60,975.60 in salary, NHL.com said,
and that money will go to the Players’ Emergency Assistance
Fund. Gillies is considered a repeat offender and forfeits his
salary based on the suspension as a percentage of the 82-game
regular season.  “By targeting his opponent’s head, three shifts into his
first game back from a suspension for a very similar action, Mr.
Gillies has forfeited his privilege of playing in the league for
10 games,” NHL Senior Executive Vice President of Hockey
Operations Colin Campbell said in a statement posted on the
league’s website.  Gillies was suspended for nine games for a blindside hit
and subsequent punches he threw at  Pittsburgh Penguins  forward
Eric Tangradi on Feb. 11. The Islanders were fined $100,000
after the game, which produced a total of 346 penalty minutes,
10 ejections and 15 fighting majors.  Gillies has one goal and 124 penalty minutes in 33 games
this season, his third in the NHL. He is eligible to return on
March 26, when the Islanders host the  Philadelphia Flyers .  To contact the reporter on this story:
