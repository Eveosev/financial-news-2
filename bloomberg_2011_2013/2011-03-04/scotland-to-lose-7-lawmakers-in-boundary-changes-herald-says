  Scotland  will lose seven of its 59
lawmakers in the U.K. parliament under proposals to shrink the
British legislature, the  Herald  said, citing the Boundary
Commission for Scotland.  The changes are part of legislation to make each U.K.
constituency as equal as possible in terms of the number of
voters. The smallest permitted electorate will be 72,810 and the
largest 80,473, the paper said.  Glasgow, Scotlandâ€™s biggest city, may lose two of its seven
seats, while Edinburgh, the capital, could have four seats
instead of five. The Western Isles and Orkney and Shetland have
been exempted from the size rules because of their island
status, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
