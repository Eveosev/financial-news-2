  Cristiano Ronaldo  injured his left
hamstring and will be out between 10 and 15 days, Real Madrid
said.  The Portuguese forward underwent tests and has a Grade I
muscle injury, the Spanish soccer team said today on its
website.  The 26-year-old asked to come out of last night’s 7-0
defeat of Malaga after scoring a hat trick. The win kept Real in
second place in La Liga, seven points behind leaders Barcelona.  At the start of the month, Ronaldo was the only non-
goalkeeper among the top eight players for minutes played in the
Spanish league. He’s played in all 26 of Real’s league matches
this season, and scored 27 times. He also has 4 goals in the
Champions League and 6 in the Spanish Cup.  Real plays at Racing de Santander in two days, and then
hosts Hercules on March 12. The team will take on Lyon in the
second match of their two-game Champions League meeting on March
16. The first game finished 1-1 in  France .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
