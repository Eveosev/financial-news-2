Corn fell on speculation that rising
energy costs will hinder the global economy, reducing demand for
food and livestock feed. Soybeans rose on bets that South
American shipments may drop.  Crude oil rose to a 29-month high on concern that unrest in  Libya  will spread to other north African and Middle East
petroleum exporters. U.S. equities dropped as data signaled that
growth in wages may fail to keep up with fuel expenses. Corn has
gained 90 percent in the past year as demand jumped.  “The surge in energy prices will reduce consumer-
purchasing power,” said  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines,  Iowa . “Traders are anxious
to bank recent profit with all the uncertainty in the Middle
East.”  Corn futures for May delivery fell 8.75 cents or 1.2
percent, to $7.28 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board.
The grain rose 0.8 percent this week, the fifth straight gain.
The most-active contract reached a 31-month high of $7.4425 on
Feb. 22.  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 2 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $14.14 a bushel, capping a 2.8 percent weekly gain,
the first since Feb. 4. On Feb. 9, the price reached a 30-month
high of $14.5575.  Cargill Inc., Archer Daniels Midland Co., Alfred C Toepfer
International BV, may be prevented from shipping oilseeds from  Argentina  after the government yesterday stripped them of their
status as registered exporters amid a dispute over taxes.  Dry weather threatens about 20 percent of the Argentina
soybean crop, and too much rain may slow harvesting in  Brazil ,
according to the Commodity Weather Group LLC.  “Uncertainty about Argentina exports could give a boost to
U.S. exports,” said Jim Gerlach, the president of A/C Trading
Inc. in Fowler,  Indiana . “Weather in  South America  is not
adding to world production.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
