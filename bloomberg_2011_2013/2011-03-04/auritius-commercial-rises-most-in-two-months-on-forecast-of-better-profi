  Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB)  Ltd., the
country’s largest lender by market value, climbed the most in
two months after the company said earnings will improve this
financial year.  The stock advanced 2 rupees, or 1.2 percent, to 172 rupees
at the 1:30 p.m. close in Port Louis, the biggest gain since
Jan. 5.  “Management told investors yesterday that the bank’s
fundamentals are improving whilst at the same time maintaining a
strong capital adequacy level of 15 percent, more than the 10
percent requirement of the central bank,” Kishen Nadassen, a
senior research analyst of CIM Stockbrokers Ltd., said by phone
today from Port Louis. “They maintained that the performance
for the second semester will be similar to the first.”  The Port Louis-based lender, which has a 23.7 percent
weighting in the Mauritius stock exchange index, said on Feb. 11
net income rose 18 percent to 2 billion rupees ($69 million) for
the half-year through December from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
