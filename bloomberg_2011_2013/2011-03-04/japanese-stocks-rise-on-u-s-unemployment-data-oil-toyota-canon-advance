Japanese stocks rose for a second
day, as signs the U.S. recovery is strengthening outweighed
concern  oil prices  may rise further and Middle East unrest might
spread.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, jumped
1.2 percent as the yen weakened, boosting the outlook for
overseas earnings. Canon Inc., a camera maker that gets about 80
percent of its sales abroad, climbed 1.8 percent. Sumitomo
Electric Industries Ltd. surged 8.1 percent after the Nikkei
newspaper said the company has developed a cheaper battery.  “There’s been a tug of war between the strong economy on
the one side and higher oil prices and the unrest in the Middle
East on the other, but the positive news is increasing,” said
Koichi Kurose, chief strategist in Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd.,
which oversees the equivalent of $57 billion in assets. “The
U.S. is gradually approaching a self-sustaining recovery.”  The Nikkei rose 1 percent to 10,693.66 at the 3 p.m. market
close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index climbed 0.7 percent to
955.59, with almost twice as many stocks advancing as falling.
For the week, the Nikkei gained 1.6 percent while the Topix
increased 1.5 percent.  The Topix rose 5.6 percent this year through yesterday,
compared with 5.8 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
and 2.8 percent for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Shares in the
Japanese benchmark are valued at 15.9 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with 13.8 times for the  S&P 500  and 11.3
times for the Stoxx 600.  Fewer Jobless Claims  All 33 industry groups in the Topix advanced, with makers
of cars and electronics lending the biggest support. Toyota
jumped 1.2 percent to 3,785 yen. Mazda Motor Corp. rallied 3.5
percent to 210 yen. Canon advanced 1.8 percent to 3,935 yen.
Konica Minolta Holdings Inc., a maker of imaging equipment that
earns about 70 percent of its revenue abroad, leapt 4.2 percent
to 768 yen.  The S&P 500 gained 1.7 percent yesterday in  New York , the
biggest advance in three months, after the Labor Department said
applications for unemployment benefits fell by 20,000 to 368,000
in the week ended Feb. 26. Economists forecast the number of
applicants would rise to 395,000. The total number of Americans
receiving  unemployment benefits  fell to the lowest level since
October 2008.  In a separate report, the  Institute for Supply Management ’s
index of non-manufacturing businesses climbed to 59.7, the
highest level since August 2005. Economists had forecast a drop
to 59.3. A reading above 50 signals growth in the service sector.  Yen, Oil  “There should be some buying across the board,” said
Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings
Inc. “The yen is weakening, oil prices have taken a breather
and you’ve got some better economic data.”  The yen depreciated to 115.17 against the euro from 113.58
at the close of  stock trading  in Tokyo yesterday, the weakest
level since Nov. 4, after European Central Bank President Jean-
Claude Trichet said the ECB may raise  interest rates  next month
to counter accelerating inflation. Against the dollar, Japan’s
currency weakened to 82.52 from 81.88. A weaker yen boosts the
value of overseas income at Japanese companies when converted
into their home currency.  Crude oil for April delivery reversed yesterday’s decline,
rising as much as 58 cents to $102.49 a barrel in electronic
trading in New York today, after Libyan opposition leaders
rejected an offer by Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  to help
broker peace in the North African country.  Sumitomo Electric, Yamaha  Sumitomo Electric Industries led gains on the Nikkei after
a report it aims to commercialize by 2015 sodium-ion batteries
for use in cars and homes. Sodium-ion batteries cost 90 percent
less than lithium-ion cells, the Nikkei newspaper said. The
shares surged 8.1 percent to 1,259 yen, the biggest gain since
May 2009.  “The market is potentially big, so it’s likely the battery
business will drive Sumitomo Electric’s growth on a long-term
basis,” Yuji Matsumoto, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc.,
wrote in a report dated today.  Yamaha Corp., a maker of musical instruments, rose 3
percent to 1,083 yen after the stock was rated “buy” in new
coverage at BNP Paribas SA. Yamaha’s musical instruments,
electronics and audio equipment divisions each look “set to
deliver rising profits over the next few years,” BNP Paribas’s
analyst James Moon said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
