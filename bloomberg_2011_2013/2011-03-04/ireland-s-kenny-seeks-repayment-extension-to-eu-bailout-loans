Enda Kenny, Ireland’s incoming prime
minister, demanded longer repayment periods for the country’s
rescue loans from the European Union on top of a cut in  interest
rates , calling current aid terms “very challenging.”  Kenny said “resistance” in “many” EU capitals to ending
the protection of senior bank bondholders in Ireland meant
relief for Irish taxpayers should instead include an extension
of loan maturities now due to average seven-and-a-half years. He
was already seeking a reduction in the 5.8 percent interest rate
on the loans tied to the 85 billion-euro ($119 billion) rescue.  “We are in a very challenging program,” Kenny told
reporters at a meeting of EU conservative leaders today in
Helsinki. “We want to see adjustments. Our overall requirement
is that there be a reduction in the cost of the package.”  He said that, while no decisions on easing the terms for
Irish aid would be taken at the Helsinki meeting, “there is a
great deal of goodwill here for Ireland.” Kenny also said he
would invite EU President  Herman Van Rompuy  to Ireland.  On March 1, EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said ending the protection in Ireland of senior bank
bondholders “is not in the cards.”  Kenny, leader of Ireland’s Fine Gael party, is in talks to
form a government after Feb. 25 elections ejected the ruling
Fianna Fail party.  To contact the reporters on this story:
