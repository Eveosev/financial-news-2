  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  received an
environmental license to transport natural gas from  Brazil ’s
largest oil field, paving the way for the state-run producer to
boost output from the deep-water deposit.  The license allows Petrobras to connect pipelines from the
Lula field, formerly known as Tupi, to the Mexilhao field in
shallower waters, Brazil’s Ibama environmental agency said today
in an e-mailed statement. Ibama also issued a license for
another pipeline at Mexilhao and gave Petrobras permission to
produce natural gas and condensate.  Petrobras currently burns off the gas it produces now as a
byproduct of oil output at Lula. Petrobras was waiting for a way
to transport the fuel before expanding operations because it
can’t boost oil production without also tapping the natural gas.  “Right now they are flaring the gas, and there are limits
to that, so they can’t increase production,” Wagner Freire,  an
independent energy consultant and former exploration and
production manager at Petrobras, said in a telephone interview
from  Rio de Janeiro .“They need the pipeline to increase
production and stop flaring the gas.”  Flaring occurs when  oil companies  burn the natural gas that
they can’t transport or inject back into the reservoir. Brazil
has restrictions on natural-gas flaring to limit emissions into
the air.  To contact the reporter on this story:
