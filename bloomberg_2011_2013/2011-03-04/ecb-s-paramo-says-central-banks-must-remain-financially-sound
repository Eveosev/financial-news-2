European Central Bank Executive
Board member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said central banks must
retain their financial integrity and independence when entrusted
with the management of public funds in a crisis situation.  “Central banks are likely to be more exposed to risks in
the event of a crisis,” Gonzalez-Paramo said in a speech in  Cape Town  today. “At the same time, they need to remain
financially sound to ensure their independence and credibility
in the conduct of monetary policy” particularly “when
inflationary expectations risk becoming unanchored.”  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said yesterday the
central bank may raise  interest rates  next month to stem faster
inflation while at the same time maintaining its emergency
measures, which include government bond purchases and lending
banks as much money as they need against eligible collateral.  “All these measures have something in common: they raise
the bar for risk management in central banking precisely in
those times in which our brains are wired to shout ‘run’,”
Gonzalez-Paramo said. “But of course, we must exercise a
disciplined and calmed responsibility and accept our role in
crisis situations.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
