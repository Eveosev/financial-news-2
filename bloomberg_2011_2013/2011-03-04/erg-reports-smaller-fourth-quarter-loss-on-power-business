  ERG SpA (ERG) ,  Italy ’s second-largest
refiner, narrowed its fourth-quarter loss as the power business
offset weak refining margins.  The net loss of 7 million euros ($9.8 million) compared
with a loss of 27 million euros a year earlier, the Genoa,
Italy-based company said today in a statement. Revenue fell 13
percent to 1.5 billion euros.  In 2010, the marketing and refining division “continued to
suffer from the weakness of refining,” Chief Executive Officer
Alessandro Garrone said in the statement. “For 2011 we expect
overall growth of earnings.”  ERG expects improved profitability from refining this year
after a period of weak demand caused by the global economic
slump. To boost earnings the company is investing in units and
equipment at its refineries and in the improvement of its
downstream sales network.  Net debt increased to 723 million euros in 2010 from 662
million euros due to the acquisition of wind unit ERG Eolica
Adriatica, the company said. The company proposed a dividend of
40 euro cents per share.  Last year ERG set up a partnership with Total SA in
refining and marketing and exercised a  put option  to sell a
further stake in its Isab Priolo refinery in Sicily to  Russia ’s
OAO Lukoil.  The transaction with Lukoil was valued at 205 million euros
and brings the Russian company’s total stake to 60 percent. ERG
said the operation will be closed in the first quarter.  Shares rose 0.3 percent to 10.2 euros as of 9:07 a.m. today
in Milan. Erg has fallen 1.9 percent since the start of the
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
