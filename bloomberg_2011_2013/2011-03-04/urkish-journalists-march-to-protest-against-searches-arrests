Turkish journalists marched in
Istanbul and Ankara today to protest against arrests of
reporters and raids on their homes and offices.  Turkish journalists are fighting more than 3,000 lawsuits
related to their work, and 61 are in prison, CNN-Turk television
said as it showed footage of the march. Police yesterday raided
addresses connected to eight writers and journalists, including
prominent critics of the government, as prosecutors expanded
their investigation into alleged coup plots against Prime
Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan .    Turkey  is ranked 138th out of 178 countries in the
Reporters Without Borders press freedom index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
