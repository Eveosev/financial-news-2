PT Timah’s tin production was
“affected” in the first quarter because bad weather disrupted
shipping, Reuters said, citing an interview with Timah Chief
Executive Officer Wachid Usman.  Most of Timah’s ships couldn’t operate, “affecting our
first quarter production,” Wachid said, according to Reuters.
Output is expected to pick up in the second and third quarters
and then drop in the fourth again due to weather, Reuters said.
Timah is  Indonesia ’s largest tin producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
