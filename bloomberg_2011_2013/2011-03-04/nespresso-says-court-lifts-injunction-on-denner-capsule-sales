Denner, a Swiss retailer, said it
will resume offering Nespresso-compatible coffeemaker capsules
after a local court lifted an injunction against their sale amid
a patent dispute with  Nestle SA. (NESN)   Denner will need at least three weeks to restart production
and stock supermarket shelves, Nicole Schoewel, a spokeswoman
based in Zurich, said today by phone. Nestle said it will
continue trying in court to halt the capsules’ sale.  “This preliminary ruling is not a ruling on the merits of
the case,” Julian Liew, a spokesman for Nestle’s Nespresso
unit, said by e-mail. “We will continue with the legal action
to protect our intellectual property rights.”  The court in  St. Gallen , Switzerland, halted the capsules’
sale in January, about a month after Denner, a unit of Swiss
retailer Migros, began marketing them. They are made by Alice
Allison SA. Sara Lee Corp. and Ethical Coffee Co. also started
selling their own versions of coffee for Nespresso machines last
year, offering consumers alternative pre-filled capsules for the
first time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
