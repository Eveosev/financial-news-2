European stocks gained before a
report that may show U.S. payrolls increased last month, adding
to signs that the economy is improving. Asian stocks rose and
U.S. index futures were little changed.  Hermes International SCA jumped 2.8 percent to 155.55 euros
after the maker of leather handbags and silk scarves said full-
year profit rose 46 percent.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.3 percent to
284.47 at 8:03 a.m. in  London .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
