  Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA (TNLP4) ,  Brazil ’s biggest fixed-line phone company, posted a profit in
the fourth quarter after adding mobile-phone clients and making
savings from its acquisition of Brasil Telecom Participacoes SA.  Net income was 284 million reais ($172 million), compared
with a loss of 597 million reais a year earlier, Oi, as the Rio
de Janeiro-based company is known, said in a regulatory filing
late yesterday. That was below the mean estimate of 355 million
reais from three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net sales fell
3.8 percent to 7.3 billion reais.  Oi boosted the number of mobile-phone customers 8.8 percent
to 39.3 million from a year earlier after its “aggressive”
offers, according to the filing. The company’s costs fell 7.8
percent to 5.02 billion reais in the quarter after savings
related to Brasil Telecom, which it agreed to take over in 2008.
In 2009, Oi incurred costs to move its  call centers  and
integrate the former rival’s operations.  Oi “resumed its sales activity in a slightly stronger way
in December,” Banco Fator SA analysts including Jacqueline Lison wrote in a March 1 note. The company prioritized “the
conclusion of the consolidation process of the operations with
Brasil Telecom, the resumption of profitability and reduction of
its financial leverage.”  Oi’s share of the Brazilian mobile market fell to 19.3
percent in January from 20.6 percent a year earlier, according
to the telecommunications regulator, Anatel. That was the lowest
share among the four largest companies, after  Vivo Participacoes
SA (VIVO4) , America Movil SAB’s Claro and  Tim Participacoes SA. (TCSL4)   The company also reduced net debt to 18.7 billion reais in
the quarter from 21.9 billion reais a year earlier. The ratio of
net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization fell to 1.8 percent from 2.2 percent.  Oi’s preferred shares rose 0.4 percent to 26.30 reais in  Sao Paulo  yesterday. The stock has risen 8.3 percent this year,
compared with a 1.7 percent fall in Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
