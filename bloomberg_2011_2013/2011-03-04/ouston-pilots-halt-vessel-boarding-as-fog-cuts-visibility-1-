Houston Ship Channel pilots halted
boarding inbound and outbound vessels early today after fog
limited visibility on the approach to the largest U.S. petroleum
port, according to the Coast Guard Vessel Traffic Service.  Boarding stopped at 12:15 a.m. local time when the fog
reduced visibility, Albert Hernandez, a watch supervisor with
the service, said in a telephone interview from Houston.  As of 6 a.m., 15 Houston-bound vessels were waiting to
enter the channel and nine vessels in Houston were waiting to
leave, he said.  Dense fog limiting visibility to about a quarter-mile (0.4
kilometer) may blanket the area until 8 a.m. with areas of fog
persisting until 10 a.m., the U.S. National Weather Service said
in a  statement  issued at 6:01 a.m. today.  Tankers use the channel connecting the  Gulf of Mexico  to
the Port of Houston to deliver crude oil to refineries in the
Houston-Texas City-Baytown area. A prolonged halt may force
refiners to reduce operating rates, possibly increasing prices
for refined products as companies turn to spot markets for oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Jim Polson  in  New York  at
