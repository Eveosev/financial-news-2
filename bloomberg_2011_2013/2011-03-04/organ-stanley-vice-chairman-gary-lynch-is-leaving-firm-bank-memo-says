Gary Lynch,  Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s chief
legal officer from 2005 until 2010, is leaving the firm.  Lynch, now a vice chairman, will "pursue opportunities
outside the firm," according to an internal memo obtained today
by Bloomberg News. Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for the New York-
based bank, confirmed the contents of the memo. Lynch had been
advising Morgan Stanley on policy and strategy issues in his
current role, according to the memo.  Lynch, 60, announced in February 2010 that he would give up
his role as chief legal officer. In July, Morgan Stanley hired
Frank Barron, a litigation partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore
LLP, to replace him in that position.  Lynch headed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s
enforcement division from 1985 to 1989 and led insider-trading
investigations of Ivan Boesky and  Michael Milken . Former Morgan
Stanley CEO  John Mack  hired Lynch to work at  Credit Suisse First
Boston  in 2001 and then at Morgan Stanley when Mack moved there
in 2005. Mack stepped down as CEO at the beginning of 2010 and
remains chairman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
