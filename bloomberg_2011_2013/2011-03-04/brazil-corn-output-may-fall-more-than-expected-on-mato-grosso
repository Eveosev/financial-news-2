Corn output in  Brazil , the world’s
third-largest producer, may fall more than expected this year
because rains delayed planting in center-western Mato Grosso
state, according to the head of a growers’ association.  Mato Grosso, the second-biggest producing region after
Parana state, could lose 2.2 million tons of corn after rains
prevented growers from sowing 30 percent of the planted area
last month, Glauber Silveira, head of Mato Grosso’s soybean and
corn producers’ association, said today in an interview.  “Farmers are late on planting and may lose what they plant
in March as rains may end before corn reaches full
development,” Silveira said in a telephone interview today from
Cuiaba. “It’s a risk to be taken.”  The Agriculture Ministry estimated corn output of 54.5
million tons on Feb. 9, compared with production of 56 million
tons last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
