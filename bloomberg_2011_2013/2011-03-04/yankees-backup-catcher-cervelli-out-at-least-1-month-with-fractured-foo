  New York  Yankees backup catcher
Francisco Cervelli will miss the start of the Major League
Baseball season after fracturing his foot.  Cervelli will be in a protective boot for at least four
weeks after fouling a ball off his left foot in a game two days
ago against the Houston Astros, Yankees manager Joe Girardi told
reporters today in Tampa, Florida.  With Russell Martin signed during the offseason to be the
Yankees’ starting catcher, the team doesn’t have plans to use  Jorge Posada , who is now New York’s designated hitter, as a
catcher during spring-training games.  Cervelli played in 93 games last season, batting .271 with
38 runs batted in and 11 doubles.  The Yankees open their season March 31 against the  Detroit
Tigers .  To contact the reporter on this story:
