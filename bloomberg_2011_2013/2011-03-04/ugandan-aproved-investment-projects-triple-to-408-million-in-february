Ugandaâ€™s approved investment
projects more than tripled in February, driven by the finance
and manufacturing industries, said Maggie Kigozi, executive
director of the  Uganda Investment Authority .  Licensed projects grew to $408 million from $122 million in
January, Kigozi told reporters today in the capital, Kampala. At
least 29 projects, 38 percent of them owned by Ugandans, were
approved last month, she said.  Projects by Ugandans were worth $214 million, while
foreigners planned $194 million worth of investments, she said.
U.K. was the leading source of planned foreign direct investment
at $104 million, followed with  Norway  at $65 million, Kigozi
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
