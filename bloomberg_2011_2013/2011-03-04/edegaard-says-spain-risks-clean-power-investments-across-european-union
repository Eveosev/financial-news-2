  Connie Hedegaard , European Union
Climate Commissioner, said  Spain ’s tariff cuts for existing
solar power plants and wind farms jeopardize clean energy
investment across  Europe .  The decision “is being perceived as retroactively reducing
the feed-in-tariffs” by investors, Hedegaard said during a
debate in  Madrid  today. “It is not just a Spanish thing. It is
about investors’ overall credibility when they invest in
renewables in Europe.”   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
