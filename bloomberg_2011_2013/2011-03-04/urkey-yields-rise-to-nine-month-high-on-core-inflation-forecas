Turkish bonds declined after the
central bank said it expects  core inflation  to accelerate over
the coming months, raising the prospect of interest rate
increases.  Benchmark two-year bond yields rose 13 basis points to 8.99
percent at 5:10 p.m. in Istanbul, a nine-month high, according
to the RBS Istanbul Benchmark Bond Index. The  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  of stocks rose 1 percent to 61,005.00. The lira weakened
0.3 percent to 1.6012 per dollar.  Core inflation will increase in the coming months and the
February decline to a four-decade low was mainly caused by the
comparison with the same month a year earlier when the
government increased taxes, the central bank said. Core
inflation, which excluded energy and grocery prices, accelerated
to 3.8 percent in February from 3.2 percent a month earlier,
according to figures announced yesterday.  “From here it’s probably all uphill,” Murat Ucer, an
economist with GlobalSource Partners in Istanbul, said in an e-
mailed report on inflation today. The central bank may resist
“increasing policy rates -- unless it is forced to by adverse
market conditions.”  Central bank Governor Durmus Yilmaz unexpectedly cut the
benchmark interest rate in December and January, taking it to a
record low of 6.25 percent. Rising global oil and commodity
prices will push prices higher and the bank’s forecast of year-
end inflation of 5.9 percent is likely to be increased in April,
he said on Feb. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
