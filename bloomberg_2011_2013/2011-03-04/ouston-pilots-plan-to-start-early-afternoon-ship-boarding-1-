Houston Ship Channel pilots planned
to resume boarding outbound and inbound vessels today after fog
lifted, restoring visibility on the approach to the largest U.S.
petroleum port, the Coast Guard Vessel Traffic Service said.  “The fog is clearing out so the pilots are being sent to
the upper channel to begin boarding early this afternoon,”
Albert Hernandez, a watch supervisor with the service, said in a
telephone interview from Houston. Boarding was halted at 12:15
a.m. local time today.  As of 11:30 a.m., 21 Houston-bound vessels were waiting to
enter the channel and 16 vessels in Houston were waiting to
leave, he said.  A  dense-fog advisory  was issued for the area until noon,
the  National Weather Service  said in a statement at 9:56 a.m.  Tankers use the channel connecting the  Gulf of Mexico  to
the Port of Houston to deliver crude oil to refineries in the
Houston-Texas City-Baytown area. A prolonged halt may force
refiners to reduce operating rates, possibly increasing prices
for refined products as companies turn to spot markets for oil.  PADD 3 refineries, the Energy Department’s designation for
the Gulf Coast region, make up about 49 percent of U.S. refining
capacity, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
