The people of  Wales  voted to broaden
the powers of their  governing assembly  in Cardiff, allowing
local lawmakers to pass legislation without gaining the consent
of the national U.K. Parliament in London.  The nation of 3 million people voted by 63.5 percent to
36.5 percent yesterday to back the measure, results announced
today showed. The assembly currently oversees more than 20
policy areas, including health, education, transport and the
environment, though it must seek approval from London for
primary lawmaking powers on a case-by-case basis. The
legislature was set up after a previous referendum in 1997.  The yes vote, secured on a turnout of just 35 percent,
raises questions over how keen Welsh voters are on further
devolution. It also draws further attention to the status of
lawmakers from Scottish and Welsh districts who can vote on
matters that affect only English voters, with no reciprocal
rights for English parliamentarians.  To contact the reporter on this story:
