Russian spy Anna Chapman, expelled
from the U.S. last year, launched a self-promotional Internet
site to provide fans with “official” photographs and news of
her television and charitable projects.  “Before I returned to Moscow in July 2010, I strove to
achieve personal harmony and was more concerned with my own
happiness,” Chapman says on the site,  www.annachapman.ru . “But
in time my ideology changed. I understand that we grasp the
fullness and meaning of life in our desire and efforts to help
those around us.”  Chapman has been the most visible of 10 Russian agents
deported from the U.S. last July. She has her own weekly
television show, “Mysteries of the World With Anna Chapman,” and
has appeared on the cover of Maxim magazine in lingerie, holding
a gun, as well as in the nude in the U.S. edition of Playboy.  Chapman will probably run for parliament as a member of
Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s United Russia party, Frants
Klintsevich, a senior United Russia official and a lawmaker in
the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, said last month..
Elections are scheduled for December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
