  Taiwan ’s dollar rose, capping its
first weekly gain in a month, after data from the U.S. signaled
growth in the world’s largest economy is gathering pace,
brightening the outlook for the island’s exports.  The currency rose to its strongest level in two weeks
before a U.S. Labor Department report today that’s forecast to
show companies hired the most workers since May. Initial claims
for jobless benefits fell to the lowest level since May 2008,
figures showed yesterday. Chinese investors may now buy as much
as a 10 percent stake in Taiwan’s flat-panel and chip-
manufacturing companies, according to a ruling from the Ministry
of Economic Affairs on March 2.  “The recovery outlook of the U.S. is pretty good, and it’s
supporting Taiwan’s dollar and other regional currencies,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader at Taiwan Shin
Kong Commercial Bank. The currency may test NT$29 next week, he
said.  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.3 percent to close at
NT$29.462 versus the greenback, extending this month’s advance
to 1 percent, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency
earlier touched NT$29.310, the strongest level since Feb. 18.  U.S. firms took on 196,000 new employees last month, up
from 36,000 in January, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey before today’s nonfarm payrolls report.  Taiwan’s government bonds were little changed both on the
day and for the week. The yield on the 1.375 percent note due
March 2021, the most-traded government debt, closed at 1.43
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
