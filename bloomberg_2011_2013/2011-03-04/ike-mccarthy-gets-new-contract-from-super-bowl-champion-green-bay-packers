Packers coach  Mike McCarthy  signed a
new multiyear contract a month after leading Green Bay to a
Super Bowl championship, the team said today in a news release.  “He’s a good football coach, a good leader and a good
man,” General Manager Ted Thompson said.  The Packers did not release details of the contract. The
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said McCarthy received an extension
believed to be for three years that will increase his salary
from $4 million per year to $5 million annually. The newspaper
did not say where it got the information.  McCarthy, 47, has a 48-32 record in five seasons with the
National Football League team, which he has led to the playoffs
three times in the past four seasons. He was offensive
coordinator for the  New Orleans Saints  and  San Francisco 49ers 
before taking the Green Bay job.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
