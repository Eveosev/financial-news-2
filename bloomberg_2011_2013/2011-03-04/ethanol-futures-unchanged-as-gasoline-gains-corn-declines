Ethanol futures were unchanged in  Chicago  as gasoline gained on unrest in Northern Africa and as
corn declined.  Denatured ethanol for April delivery was steady at $2.618 a
gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade as gasoline soared to a 30-
month high. Separately, corn, the primary ingredient in the
alternative fuel, decreased on signs of lower demand for food
and livestock feed.  “The corn market was down and the energy markets were
firm,” said John Janney, a vice president at Citigroup Global
Markets Inc. in Chicago.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast jumped
2.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.705 a gallon and in  New York 
the additive increased 2 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.705,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago added 1.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$2.62 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel rose 1 cent, or
0.4 percent, to $2.675.  Crude for April delivery surged $2.51, or 2.5 percent, to
settle at $104.42 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Prices have risen 30 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for April delivery climbed 2.02 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $3.0464 a gallon in New York. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  Corn futures for May delivery dropped 8.75 cents, or 1.2
percent, to close at $7.28 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel of
the grain makes about 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  An average ethanol mill in  Iowa  is breaking even on every
gallon produced, while a plant in  Illinois  is pocketing about 3
cents after losing one cent last week, according to Ag Trader
