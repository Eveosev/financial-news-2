Samba Financial Group (SAMBA) ,  Saudi
Arabia ’s second-largest publicly traded company by market value,
said third-quarter profit rose 3 percent as income from
investment increased.  Net income rose to 1.135 billion riyals ($303 million) from
1.103 billion riyals a year earlier, the Riyadh-based lender
said in a statement to the  Saudi bourse  today. That beat the
mean estimate of six analysts who forecast a profit of 1.12
billion riyals, according to data on Bloomberg.  Higher lending and lower provisions has helped improve
earnings at Saudi banks as growth in the world’s largest oil
producer accelerates, spurred by a $130 billion spending plan
announced by  King Abdullah . Al Rajhi Bank, the kingdom’s largest
lender, Saudi British Bank, Banque Saudi Fransi and Saudi
Hollandi Bank reported higher quarterly profit last week.  “The reason for increasing the profit of the third quarter
by 2.9 percent compared with the corresponding quarter last year
is the increasing income from investments,” the statement said.
Total investments climbed 2.5 percent to 66 billion riyals.  Samba said outstanding loans rose 8.5 percent from a year
earlier to 88.3 billion riyals, while its customer deposits
advanced 2.3 percent to 134.9 billion riyals.  Samba’s shares rose 0.7 percent to 44.50 riyals in  Riyadh 
today before the earnings were released, giving the bank a
market value of 40 billion riyals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
