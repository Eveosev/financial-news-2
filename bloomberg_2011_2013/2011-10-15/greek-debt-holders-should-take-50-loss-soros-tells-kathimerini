Greece  should restructure its debt
with about a 50 percent loss to bondholders,  Kathimerini 
newspaper said, citing an interview with billionaire investor
 George Soros .  It would be better for the move to be voluntary to avoid a
credit event and this could be done through the issuance of new
bonds backed by the European Financial Stability Facility, or
EFSF, Soros told the Athens-based newspaper, in an interview to
be published in tomorrow’s edition. Greece should take more
measures and “must” remain a euro area member, Soros said,
according to Kathimerini.  To contact the reporter on this story:
