Bundesbank board member Andreas
Dombret said the  International Monetary Fund  has sufficient
funds for now.  “The Bundesbank has always advocated that the IMF, as a
quota-based institution, be equipped with sufficient funds to
fulfil its important global function,” Dombret said in an e-
mailed response to a question. “To ensure this, the Bundesbank
has always been a reliable partner of the IMF and has made
contributions within the framework of bilateral and multilateral
credit lines in addition to its quota-based provisioning of
funds. From the point of view of the Bundesbank, the IMF is
currently endowed with sufficient funds.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
