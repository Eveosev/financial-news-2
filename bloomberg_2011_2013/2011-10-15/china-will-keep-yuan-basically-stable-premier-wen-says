China  will keep the yuan “basically
stable” to avoid excessive impact on the nation’s foreign trade
companies, Premier  Wen Jiabao  said during a trip to Guangzhou in
southern China, according to the China National Radio.  China will keep its export policies stable and boost
lending to importers to help better balance trade, he was cited
as saying, without providing details. The international
financial crisis hasn’t ended and the situation has become more
complex and severe, Wen was cited saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
