Bundesbank President and  European
Central Bank  governing council member Jens Weidmann said the
global economic outlook “clouded over” in the past weeks and
there are “significant downside risks” for the German economy.  Still, while the Bundesbank expects the German economy to
go through a “dent” in growth, it doesn’t expect a recession,
Weidmann told reporters after a meeting of finance ministers and
central bank governors from the 20 biggest economies in Paris.  “It still holds true that the German economy is well
prepared” to deal with a slowdown, Weidmann said, rejecting
stimulus measures as they might undermine  Germany ’s role as a
“stability anchor” in the euro region.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
