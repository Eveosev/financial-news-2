Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. and  Abu
Dhabi ’s Etihad Airways are in discussions about partnering if
Virgin pursues a bid for  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ’s U.K.-based BMI
unit, the Financial Times said.  Offers for BMI were required to be submitted this week,
with Virgin bidding alone, the newspaper said, citing a person
familiar with the situation. Etihad Airways cannot pursue an
offer alone because of foreign-ownership rules, the FT reported.  Virgin Atlantic spokeswoman Jo Foster declined to comment
on the report when contacted by Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
