Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. and  Abu
Dhabi ’s Etihad are in discussions about partnering if Virgin
pursues a bid for  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ’s U.K.-based BMI unit,
the Financial Times said.  Offers for BMI were required to be submitted this week,
with Virgin bidding alone, the newspaper said, citing a person
familiar with the situation. Etihad cannot pursue an offer alone
because of foreign-ownership rules, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
