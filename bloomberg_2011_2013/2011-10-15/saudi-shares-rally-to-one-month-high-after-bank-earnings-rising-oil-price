Saudi shares rose to the highest
level in a month as banks posted better-than-estimated earnings
and after global stocks gained and oil rallied amid optimism
over steps by European leaders to support the region’s banks.  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , Saudi Arabia’s largest publicly traded
lender by market value, strengthened the most in a week. Saudi
Holland Bank jumped the most in seven months after posting four-
fold profit increase.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s
biggest petrochemicals maker, surged to the highest price in
three weeks.  The 148-company  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  rose 1 percent to
6,164.60, the highest level since Sept. 17, at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Riyadh. Six shares rose for every stock that dropped.  “The market is gaining, supported by banks, many of whose
earnings were released last weekend,” said Turki Fadaak, head
of research at Riyadh-based Albilad Investment Co. Eight of the
11 publicly traded banks reported third-quarter earnings on Oct.
12.  “Continuous positive international market performance and
oil above 85 dollars, as well as good results by major Saudi
banks are lifting the index,” said Samer Darwiche, a financial
analyst at Gulfmena Investments in Dubai.  U.S. stocks rose, driving the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
to the largest weekly gain since July 2009. The  S&P 500  climbed
6 percent this week to the highest level since Aug. 3. Stocks
rallied after German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said they will deliver a plan to
recapitalize European banks by Nov. 3. The Group of 20 began
talks yesterday to address the debt crisis.  Rising Oil Price  Oil rose to a three-week high in New York yesterday. Crude
oil for November delivery rose $2.57 to $86.80 a barrel on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement since Sept.
20. Prices climbed 4.6 percent this week. Saudi Arabia, holder
of one-fifth of the world’s proven oil reserves, depends on oil
for 86 percent of its revenue.  Sabic climbed 1.6 percent to 92.75 riyals, its highest
price since Sept. 27.  Al Rajhi  posted the largest gain since Oct. 9, soaring to
69 riyals after trading up as much as 2.2 percent. The lender
said third-quarter profit rose 18 percent 1.94 billion riyals
($517 million), beating analyst estimates.  Saudi Hollandi jumped 5 percent, the largest gain since
March 7, to 27.20 riyals. The Riyadh-based lender said third-
quarter net income rose to 299.4 million riyals, about four
times the profit of the year-earlier period of 85.3 million
riyals.  Banque Saudi Fransi (BSFR)  surged the most in six weeks, gaining
3.6 percent to 40 riyals after the Saudi lender part-owned by
Credit Agricole SA said third-quarter profit rose 22 percent to
760 million riyals.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
