Turkish state employees will receive
a 3 percent pay rise in the first half of next year and a
matching increase in the second half, Haberturk newspaper
reported.  The governmentâ€™s medium-term economic program forecasts
inflation of 5.2 percent next year, Istanbul-based Haberturk
said. If the inflation rate exceeds that target, public
employees will be compensated for the difference, the newspaper
said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
