The  New York Mets  hired former
Oakland Athletics manager Bob Geren as bench coach as the team
rebuilds its staff following a third consecutive losing season.  The Mets made the announcement yesterday in an e-mailed
statement. Geren, 50, was fired by the Athletics in June, having
spent four and a half seasons with the team that current Mets
general manager Sandy Alderson ran from 1983 to 1998.  The Mets finished the season 77-85 and have made the
playoffs once in the last 11 years. On Oct. 5 the team announced
that it had fired four coaches, including bench coach Ken Oberkfell.  “Bob Geren’s experience as a former manager and bench
coach will be a great fit for us,” Mets manager Terry Collins
said in the statement.  Geren was 334-376 with no playoff appearances during his
tenure in Oakland, and was the bench coach for the  Arizona
Diamondbacks  when they won the  World Series  in 2001. He played
four seasons as a catcher with the  New York Yankees  from
1988-1991.  -- Editors: Michael Sillup, Rob Gloster  To contact the reporter on this story:
