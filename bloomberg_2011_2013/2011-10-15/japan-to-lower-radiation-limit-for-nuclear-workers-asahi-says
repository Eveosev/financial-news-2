The Japanese government will lower
the annual radiation exposure limit for nuclear plant workers to
100 millisieverts, the maximum amount of exposure allowed before
the accident in Fukushima, from the current 250 millisieverts,
the Asahi newspaper reported, citing the nationâ€™s health
ministry.   Revised regulations would only apply to new workers, and
the government would be able to increase the limit when needed,
the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
