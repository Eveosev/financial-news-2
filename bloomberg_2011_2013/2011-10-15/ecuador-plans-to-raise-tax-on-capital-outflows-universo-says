Ecuador plans to raise its tax for
capital outflows to 5 percent from a current 2 percent,
newspaper  El Universo  reported, citing Carlos Marx Carrasco,
director of the countryâ€™s internal revenue service, known as
SRI.  The measure is part of a tax reform plan that the
government of President  Rafael Correa  will send to Congress, the
Quito-based newspaper said, citing Carrasco. Under Correa, the
capital-outflow tax has been increased twice, to 1 percent from
0.5 percent and then to 2 percent, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
