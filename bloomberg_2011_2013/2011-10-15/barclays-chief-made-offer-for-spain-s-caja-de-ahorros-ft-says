Bob Diamond, Chief Executive Officer
of  Barclays Plc (BARC) , made a non-binding preliminary offer for  Caja
de Ahorros del Mediterraneo (CAM)  earlier this month, according to the
Financial Times.  The deal would make Barclays one of the top seven lenders
in Spain, the newspaper said, citing people close the company.
If the bank does not pursue the transaction, Barclays may exit
Spain within 18 months, the FT reported.  Barclays spokesman Giles Croot declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
