Vale S.A.,  Brazil â€™s biggest mining
company, is giving Chinese customers the option of paying for
iron ore in the fourth quarter at prices close to the spot
market price, O Estado de S.Paulo newspaper  reported , citing an
unidentified executive in the mining sector.  Vale and other miners are ceding to pressure from Chinese
steelmakers unhappy with paying the higher iron ore prices set
in quarterly contracts, following recent falls in the spot
price, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
