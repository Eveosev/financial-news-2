European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said member states are “close”
to reaching an agreement on banks’ recapitalization.  “We will have more clarity” in “the coming days” Rehn
told Bloomberg Television in an interview after a meeting of
central bankers and finance ministers from the Group of 20
nations in Paris today. While he declined to comment on a
possible capital level of 9 percent, he said it’s important to
have “clear” plans on recapitalization.  There’s “a sense of urgency” among EU member states to
contain the crisis and build a firewall, he said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
