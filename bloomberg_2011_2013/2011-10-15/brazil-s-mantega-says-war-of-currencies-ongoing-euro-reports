The expansive monetary policies of
some industrial nations help keep the value their currencies
low, creating problems for the economies of countries including
 Brazil  in a “war of currencies,”  Euro  magazine said, citing
Brazil’s Finance Minister  Guido Mantega .  Some countries are devaluating their currencies to increase
competitiveness of their export industries in light of weak
national demand, Mantega said in the interview, calling such
behavior “manipulation” and “unfair practices in
international trade.”  Mantega said he has turned to the World Trade Organization
for help on the matter, without being more specific.  The Brazilian economy will grow at more than 5 percent per
year on average in both 2012 and 2013, provided the crisis does
not worsen, Mantega is cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
