Frankel  extended his unbeaten streak
by winning the one-mile Qipco Queen Elizabeth II stakes at the
inaugural  British Champions Day , the richest day in British
horse racing.  Frankel had won all of his previous eight races in a
combined length of 100 meters. Today at Ascot, he finished first
by four lengths.  The three-year-old colt, owned by Saudi Prince Khalid Abdullah, has now nine consecutive races. Rated the best
racehorse in the world by the British Horseracing Authority,
Frankel’s victory at Ascot today has netted his owner 567,700
pounds ($897,420).  Trained by Henry Cecil and sired by Derby winner Galileo,
Frankel won the 2,000 Guineas in April in Newmarket by six
lengths. He was the 2-7 favorite at U.K. bookmaker  William Hill
Plc (WMH)  to win today’s race. That means a successful $7 bet on the
horse would return $2 plus the original stake.  The Queen Elizabeth II stakes are part of British Champions
Day, a new horse race event created to promote the sport in the
U.K. Sponsored by the  Qatar International  Investment & Projects
Development Holding Co., the Champions Day has prize money of 3
million pounds, the most in British racing history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
