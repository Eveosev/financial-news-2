U.S. 30-year bonds capped the
longest weekly losing streak since January as concern eased that
 Europe  is unable to curb its debt crisis and U.S. retail sales
climbed, damping bets the country will fall into a recession.  Treasuries are off to the worst monthly start this year
just after completing the strongest quarter since 2008 as
appetite for higher-yielding assets overtook demand for a refuge
that was spurred by speculation the debt crisis was worsening
and the  U.S. economy  was floundering. Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  will speak next week on the effects of the last
recession on central bank policy.  “Optimism in Europe and a better outlook in the U.S. have
weighed on Treasuries this week,” said  Michael Cloherty , head
of U.S. rates strategy for fixed income and currencies in  New
York  at Royal Bank of Canada, one of the 22 primary dealers that
trade with the Fed. “You really must have a steady drumbeat of
bad news to sustain lower yields, and we are not seeing that.”  Thirty-year yields rose 22 basis points, or 0.22 percentage
point, to 3.23 percent yesterday in New York from a week
earlier, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It was the
long bonds’ third weekly loss, the longest since the three weeks
ended Jan. 21. The 3.75 percent securities due in August 2041
dropped 4 15/32, or $44.69 per $1,000 face amount, to 109 7/8.  The benchmark 10-year yield increased 17 basis points to
2.25 percent as the note’s price fell for the third week in its
longest losing streak since April. The yield reached 2.27
percent on Oct. 12, the most since Sept. 1.  Most This Year  Treasuries have lost 1.2 percent in October, the most in
any month in 2011, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index. They returned 6.4 percent from July through September,
their best quarter since the depths of the financial crisis at
the end of 2008.  The Fed purchased $12 billion in Treasuries this week
maturing from 2017 to 2041 as part of a program known as
Operation Twist to keep borrowing costs down and jumpstart the
economy. The central bank is buying $400 billion of longer-term
Treasuries through June and selling an equal amount of shorter-
term debt in its portfolio. It sold $8.9 billion this week of
Treasuries due in 2013.  Ten-year Treasury yields climbed yesterday on speculation
Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers opening a two-
day meeting in Paris will agree to give the  International
Monetary Fund  greater firepower to resolve Europe’s debt woes.  The region’s two-year sovereign debt crisis has pushed
 Greece  to the brink of default, threatened to curb world
economic growth and raised speculation the 17-nation euro won’t
last in its current form, sending the yield on the U.S. 10-year
note to a record low 1.67 percent on Sept. 23.  Rescue Plan  European officials yesterday were discussing a rescue plan
that may include deeper investor losses on Greek bonds and
higher bank capital levels.  “Europe is the thing driving the train, and we’ve had a
significant turnaround in sentiment which has weighed on
Treasuries,” James Caron, head of U.S. interest-rate strategy
in New York at the primary dealer Morgan Stanley, said Oct. 11.  Improving domestic economic news also sapped demand for
Treasuries. Retail sales increased 1.1 percent in September, the
biggest jump since February and the second-biggest in almost a
year, Commerce Department data showed yesterday. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 0.7 percent rise.  U.S. nonfarm payrolls grew more than forecast in September,
government data showed last week, increasing by 103,000 jobs
versus a Bloomberg survey estimated of 60,000. The  unemployment
rate  remained at 9.1 percent.  ‘Tone of Contention’  Minutes of the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s Sept. 20-21
meeting released Oct. 12 showed some policy makers saw
“considerable uncertainty” that U.S. economic growth will pick
up. Debate culminated in the decision to launch Operation Twist.  Some officials wanted to keep further asset purchases as an
option to boost the economy. The Fed previously bought $2.35
trillion of assets in two rounds of quantitative easing.  “The tone of contention among Fed members is going to
continue no matter what happens in the economy going forward,”
Thomas Simons, a government debt economist in New York at The
primary dealer Jefferies Group Inc. said Oct. 12.  Bernanke is scheduled to speak on Oct. 18 at the Boston Fed
on the slump’s effect on “central bank doctrine and practice.”
The Fed will release its Beige Book economic survey a day later.  Inflation Outlook  The increase in the cost of living in the U.S. slowed last
month, a report on Oct. 19 is forecast to show. The  consumer
price index  quickened 0.3 percent in September, from 0.4 percent
a month earlier, economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast
before the Labor Department reports the data.  The difference in yield between 10-year Treasuries and
comparable inflation-indexed debt, a measure of traders’
expectations for consumer prices known as the break-even rate,
widened yesterday to 1.99 percentage points, the highest since
Sept. 8 after reaching 1.67 percent on Sept. 23, the least in a
year. It has averaged 2.29 percent in 2011.  The U.S. sold $66 billion in notes and bonds this week. A
$13 billion sale of the 30-year bond Oct. 13 drew a record low
yield of 3.12 percent. The government sold $32 billion in three-
year notes Oct. 11 at a yield of 0.544 percent and $21 billion
in 10-year debt Oct. 12 at 2.271 percent.  The entire amount raised this week was new cash, with none
of the proceeds dedicated to redeeming maturing securities,
according to the Treasury Department.  The government will sell $7 billion in 30-year Treasury
