Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  Mini
Cooper S cars are under U.S. investigation after 12 reports of
engine fires, including five that resulted in a total loss of
the vehicle.  The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
announced the probe today on its website, saying in eight of the
complaints, fires occurred when the cars were parked and turned
off.  The investigation includes about 36,000 Mini Coopers from
model years 2007 and 2008. The regulator said the “complaints
show an apparent increasing trend with most complaints received
within the past year.”  U.S.-based spokesmen for the Munich-based automaker didn’t
immediately respond to e-mails sent outside of normal business
hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
