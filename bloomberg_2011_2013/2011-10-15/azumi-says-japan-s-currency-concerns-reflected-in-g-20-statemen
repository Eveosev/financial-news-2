Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi
said  Japan ’s concerns about excessive currency movements were
reflected in the Group of 20’s statement after a meeting of
finance chiefs in Paris.  The “main pillars” of Japan’s views were included in the
G-20 communique, Azumi told reporters today. A Japanese official,
speaking on condition of anonymity in line with government
policy, said Japan convinced G-20 nations to say in the
statement that “excess volatility and disorderly movements in
exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and
financial stability.”  Japan has intervened three times since September last year
in an attempt to weaken the yen as its continued strength
threatens to hurt the nation’s export-dependent economy.  Bank of
Japan  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said yesterday global
uncertainties are pressuring the yen and urged European nations
to tackle their debt problems swiftly.  The yen closed at 77.22 against the dollar in New York
trading this week after rising to a post-war record of 75.95 on
Aug. 19.  Azumi said Japan, whose public debt is projected by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to reach
219 percent of gross domestic product next year, even before
accounting for borrowing to fund reconstruction after the March
earthquake, must not allow its fiscal situation to deteriorate
further.  A global failure to maintain confidence in  government bonds 
would create “massive problems,” Azumi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
