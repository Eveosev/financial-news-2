Royal Philips Electronics NV plans
to announce several hundred job cuts in the Netherlands and
several thousand abroad,  De Telegraaf  reported, citing an
unidentified union official.  The domestic staff reductions will be achieved to the
extent possible by natural attrition, the official was cited as
saying. The company is likely to post third-quarter net income
of 53.8 million euros ($75 million), down from 524 million a
year earlier, in its Oct. 17 earnings report, according to a
consensus of analyst estimates, the Dutch daily newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
