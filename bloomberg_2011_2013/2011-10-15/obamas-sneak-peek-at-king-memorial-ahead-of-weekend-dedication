President  Barack Obama , his wife and
daughters visited the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial on the
National Mall in  Washington  tonight, two days before the
president will speak at the dedication ceremony.  The first family traveled the few blocks from the White
House to the memorial by motorcade at 7:50 p.m. The visit wasn’t
announced ahead of time on Obama’s public schedule.  Obama, 50, the nation’s first black president, will help
dedicate the first memorial on the National Mall honoring a
black leader. Obama has said King’s work helped make his
presidency possible.  King’s image, carved in stone, stares out at the Tidal
Basin amid memorials to former Presidents Thomas Jefferson and
 Abraham Lincoln . On the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, the civil
rights activist in 1963 gave his “I Have a Dream” speech,
envisioning a land free of racial prejudice and segregation. The
memorial dedication, set for August, was postponed because of
Hurricane Irene.  To contact the reporter on this story:
