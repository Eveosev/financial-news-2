Vattenfall AB’s application to carry
out carbon storage in the so-called Vedsted structure northwest
of Aalborg,  Denmark  has been denied, according to a letter from
Climate and Energy Minister Martin Lidegaard published on the
parliament’s website.  The department will await the outcome of carbon capture and
storage projects in other countries before approving the process
for use in Denmark, the minister said in the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
