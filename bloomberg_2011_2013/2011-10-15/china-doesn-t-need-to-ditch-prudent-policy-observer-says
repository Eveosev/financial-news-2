China  has no need to abandon its
prudent monetary policy now because money supply is already high
compared to the economy, the Economic Observer reported, citing
People’s Bank of China adviser Zhou Qiren.  The real interest rate remains negative and loosening up
monetary controls won’t give too much support to small
companies, whose biggest problem is high production costs rather
than funding difficulties, the Chinese-language newspaper said,
citing Zhou’s comments in an interview.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
