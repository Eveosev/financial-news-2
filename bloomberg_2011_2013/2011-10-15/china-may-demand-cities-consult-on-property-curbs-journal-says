China â€™s housing ministry may ask
local governments to consult the authorities before adjusting
real-estate curbs, the China Business Journal reported, citing
an unnamed person.  Cities will need to notify provincial authorities and
listen to their advice while municipalities administered by the
central government should go to the State Council, the report
said, citing a person close to the Ministry of Housing and
Urban-Rural Development.  The State Council and the housing ministry made inquiries
after the city of Foshan announced Oct. 10 it would loosen some
limits on property purchases, the Chinese-language newspaper
said in its Oct. 17 edition, available today. The city suspended
the plans a day later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
