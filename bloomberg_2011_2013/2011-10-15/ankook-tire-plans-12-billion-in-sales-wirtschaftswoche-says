Hankook Tire Co Ltd. (000240)  plans to
increase annual production to 200 million tires over the long
term from 90 million today and more than double sales to as much
as $12 billion from about $5 billion in 2011,  WirtschaftsWoche 
reported.  The company plans to be on par with rivals including
Michelin & Cie. and Bridgestone Corp. in  brand recognition  in
five to 10 years, the magazine said, citing comments by Chief
Financial Officer Hyun Bum Cho.  Hankook may make acquisitions to reach its target,
WirtschaftsWoche added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
