Tokyo Electric Power Co. measured
radiation levels of 4,700 millisieverts per hour inside the No.
1 reactor building of its Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant,
public broadcaster NHK said, citing the utility company.  The level is higher than 4,000 millisieverts recorded in
June, the report said. Tepco said the evaporation of
contaminated water in the basement was behind the elevated
readings, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
