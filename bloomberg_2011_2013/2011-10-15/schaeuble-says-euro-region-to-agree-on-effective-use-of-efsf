German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said euro region governments will agree measures to
boost the enhanced European Financial Stability Facility’s
lending capacity even while rejecting a role for the  European
Central Bank  in leveraging the EFSF’s funds.  “We will agree on the necessary measures for an effective
use of the instruments of the financing facility so that we can
fight the danger of contagion pre-emptively,” Schaeuble told
reporters after a meeting of finance ministers and central bank
governors from the 20 biggest economies in Paris. Leveraging the
EFSF via the ECB is “not on the table,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
