German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said he wants a financial transaction tax to be
introduced in  Europe  after a meeting of finance officials from
the 20 biggest economies showed there is “no chance” for an
agreement at global level.  “We also talked about the financial transaction tax,”
Schaeuble told reporters after a meeting of finance ministers
and central bank governors from the 20 biggest economies. “It
became clear, not surprisingly, that we have to introduce it in
Europe because there is no chance for a global agreement.”  “We have to do this in Europe and we will do this with
great energy” at the next meeting of European Union finance
ministers, Schaeuble said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
