A group of protestors in  Rome  set
fire to three cars and shattered windows of two banks and a
supermarket in Via Cavour, Sky TG24 reported.  Windows of Cassa di Risparmio di Rimini and Poste Italiane
SpA branches were broken and cash distributors destroyed,
according to Sky TG24. The Italian and European Union flags were
also burned at a hotel on the same street, Sky TG24 reported.  About 500 protestors with masks, helmets and clubs are
causing disturbances in the city, Sky TG24 reported. The protest
is mostly peaceful, according to the broadcast.  Firecrackers were thrown at buildings, including the

who lost a finger. Police charged on a group of a hundred of
protesters with tear gas and water cannons.  Four anarchists were arrested before the march, Sky TG24
