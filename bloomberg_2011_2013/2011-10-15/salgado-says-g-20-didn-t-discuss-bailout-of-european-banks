Spanish Finance Minister  Elena
Salgado  said there had been no talks between finance ministers
of the Group of 20 over whether European banks will need further
capital.  “I have not heard anything about rescuing European
banks,” she told reporters after the G-20 meeting in Paris
today. “We’ve not spoken of any other bank,” she said, apart
from Dexia SA.  “We’ve absolutely not spoken about further rescue plans,”
she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
