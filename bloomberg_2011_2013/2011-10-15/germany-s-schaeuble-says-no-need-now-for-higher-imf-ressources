German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said he doesn’t see a need at this time to increase
the International Monetary Fund’s resources.  “Everybody agrees that the IMF has to have adequate
resources at its disposal at all times, but I want to add that
from our point of view there is no need at this time for an
increase of the IMF’s resources,” Schaeuble told reporters
after a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors
from the 20 biggest economies.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
