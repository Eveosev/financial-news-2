Norma Group AG will grow sales by as
much as 12 percent to about 570 million euros ($790 million)
this year,  Boersen-Zeitung  said, citing an interview with Chief
Financial Officer Othmar Belker.  Norma plans to acquire companies with annual sales of
between 10 million euros and 40 million, the newspaper cites the
executive as saying. It aims to boost profit as a percentage of
sales to close to 18 percent this year from 17.4 percent in
2010, the paper said.  The companyâ€™s line of credit of 100 million euros gives it
ample leeway for such acquisitions, Belker is cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
