Bob Diamond, Chief Executive Officer
of  Barclays Plc (BARC) , made a non-binding preliminary offer for  Caja
de Ahorros del Mediterraneo (CAM)  earlier this month, according to the
Financial Times.  The deal would make Barclays one of the top seven lenders
in Spain, the newspaper said, citing people close the company.
If the bank does not pursue the deal, Barclays may exit Spain
within 18 months, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
