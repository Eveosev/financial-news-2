The  St. Louis Cardinals  took
advantage of four Milwaukee errors to defeat the Brewers 7-1 and
take a three-games-to-two lead in the National League
Championship Series.  The best-of-seven series now returns to Milwaukee for Game
6 on Oct. 16. If the Brewers win that game, Game 7 would be the
following day in Milwaukee.  The Cardinals scored three unearned runs tonight. Matt
Holliday had a two-run double among his three hits for St.
Louis,   Albert Pujols  had a run-scoring single and one of Yadier
Molinaâ€™s three hits was a run-scoring double.  In the American League, the Texas Rangers return home
tomorrow night with a 3-2 lead against the Detroit Tigers in
their championship series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
