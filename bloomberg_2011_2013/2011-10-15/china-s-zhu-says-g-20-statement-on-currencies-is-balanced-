Chinese deputy finance minister  Zhu
Guangyao  said the Group of 20’s statement on currencies is
“balanced.”  The G-20 communique issued after a meeting of finance
ministers and central bankers in Paris today describes the
currency issue in a “very comprehensive and balanced way,” Zhu
said in an interview. The discussions were “important
preparation” for a G-20 leaders’ summit on Nov. 3-4, he said.  The G-20 finance chiefs left their comments on currencies
broadly unchanged in today’s statement, repeating their support
for “market-determined exchange rates.”  “We reiterate that excess volatility and disorderly
movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for
economic and financial stability,” they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
