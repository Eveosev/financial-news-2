Group of 20 finance chiefs will
today call on  Europe ’s leaders to take decisive steps when they
meet Oct. 23 to contain the region’s sovereign debt crisis,
according to an official from a G-20 nation.  The draft statement to be released after talks today in
Paris advises the EU to maximise the power of its regional
rescue fund and to avoid contagion, according to the official
who spoke on condition of anonymity because the statement isn’t
finalized.  The G-20 will also commit to ensuring banks are capitalized
and pledge that central banks stand ready to provide liquidity,
the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
