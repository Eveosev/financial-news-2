Koc Holding AS (KCHOL) ’s gasoline retail
unit may buy petrol stations after the country’s energy
regulator restricted the term of exclusive franchise agreements,
Milliyet newspaper reported.  The rules imposed last year limit the term of such
relationships to five years, Milliyet said. That may make it
more advantageous for retailers to buy the stations themselves,
said Cuneyt Agca, chief executive of Koc’s Opet unit, according
to Milliyet. Opet may set up a real estate investment trust for
such assets, he said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
