Brazil ’s securities regulator is
investigating “atypical” movements in interest-rate futures
contracts ahead of the central bank’s surprise Aug. 31 rate cut,
O Globo newspaper reported, citing a person it didn’t identify.  In the days before the meeting, “two or three”
unidentified banks changed their position to bets that policy
makers would cut rates, the Rio de Janeiro-based newspaper said.  The securities regulator didn’t answer telephone calls from
Bloomberg News seeking comment outside of regular business
hours.  To contact the reporters on this story:
