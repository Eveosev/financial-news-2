     Oct. 15 (Bloomberg News) -- China urged developed nations
at the Group of 20 meeting in Paris to ensure economic growth
and financial stability in the short term and enhance their
fiscal soundness in the medium term, the official Xinhua News

worldâ€™s recovery by taking steps to prevent an economic slowdown
while also tackling inflation and making economic reforms, the
report said.  --Victoria Ruan. Editors: Matthew Brockett  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
