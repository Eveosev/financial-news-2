German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said finance ministers and central bank governors from
the Group of 20 nations were “pleased” about European efforts
to contain the region’s debt crisis.  “Our colleagues were pleased that we Europeans,
representatives of the  euro zone , have kept our word because it
was very important of course to enact by this meeting in all
member states’ parliaments the decisions about strengthening the
EFSF that were taken on July 21,” Schaeuble told reporters
after the G-20 meeting in Paris. “For our colleagues that was
confirmation that we’re aware of our responsibility and we’ll
solve the problems in the euro zone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
