Atlantia SpA (ATL)  is considering making a
bid for Turkish highways,  Il Messaggero  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The board yesterday examined terms for participation in the
privatization process with the Dogus group, the newspaper said.  The Koc family may also participate, Il Messaggero
reported, adding that  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) 
obtained advisory mandates for the privatization.  The board also considered the possible sale of a stake in
Costanera Norte to a fund as an alternative to listing the
Chilean holding company Atlantia controls with Gavio Group and
 Mediobanca SpA (MB) , the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
