Former  Olympus Corp. (7733)  Chief Executive
Officer Michael C. Woodford said he may have been fired because
of his inquiries into acquisitions made by the company in 2006
and 2008, the Financial Times reported.  The executive was pushing for more information on the
purchase of Gyrus in 2008 and three other purchases, the
newspaper said today, citing documents it had seen. Olympus
auditors, including accounting firm KPMG LLP, also raised
concerns about the Gyrus transaction, the newspaper said. KPMG
declined to comment, the FT said.  Woodford told the FT that he was not allowed to speak at
the board meeting that voted to remove him, the newspaper
reported. While he did not have evidence Olympus executives
benefited in improper ways because of the deals, about $1.3
billion in  shareholder value  was destroyed, he said, according
to the FT.  A 2009 report commissioned by the company did not uncover
any illegal actions, the newspaper said. The company said it has
disclosed everything it was required to and declined to comment
on payments made to financial advisers or Woodwardâ€™s other
claims, the FT reported.  Calls by Bloomberg News to the Tokyo press office of
Olympus outside business hours today went unanswered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
