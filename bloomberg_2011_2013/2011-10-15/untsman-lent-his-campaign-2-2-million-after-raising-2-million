Texas  Governor Rick Perry led the
Republican field in fundraising in the third quarter, taking in
$17.2 million and entering October with more money in the bank
than any of his challengers for his party’s presidential
nomination,  Federal Election Commission  reports show.  Perry reported $15.1 million in cash as of Sept. 30. Former
Massachusetts Governor  Mitt Romney , who raised $14.2 million
from July to September, had $14.7 million in cash.
Representative  Michele Bachmann , winner of the  Iowa  straw poll,
raised $3.9 million and had $1.3 million in the bank.  Romney led all Republican contenders by raising $32.6
million through Sept. 30, While former House Speaker Newt Gingrich reported $1.2 million in debts, more than any other
candidate.  President  Barack Obama ’s campaign has overwhelmed the
Republican field financially. He raised $42.1 million from July
through September, including $9 million from a joint fundraising
committee with the  Democratic National Committee  and almost $20
million in amounts of $200 or less. He has raised $88 million
for his re-election and spent $29 million. Obama reported $61.4
million in the bank, four times what Perry and Romney have on
hand.  Simmons Contributions  Perry received $5,000 from the political action committee
of Dallas-based Contran Corp., whose chairman, Harold Simmons,
is the second-largest individual contributor to his
gubernatorial campaigns, according to  Texans for Public Justice ,
an Austin-based watchdog group.  Simmons and his wife also contributed $2,500 apiece to the
Perry campaign, as did his brother, Glenn, Contran’s vice
chairman, and his wife.  Romney had led all Republican contenders by raising $18.3
million from April to June. While through Sept. 30, he has taken
in $32.6 million, more than any other Republican, he has also
spent more money, $18 million, including $12.3 million from July
through September. The campaign spent more than $3 million on
fundraising and strategy consultants, $2.7 million on direct
mail and $1.5 million on staff.  Perry’s Travel  Perry’s largest expenditure was $459,171 on travel. He
spent $397,195 on staff. In total, he spent $2.1 million.  Bachmann, of  Minnesota , raised 72 percent of her money,
$2.8 million, in donations of $200 or less. Small donors are
important because they haven’t yet reached the maximum
contribution level of $2,500 and candidates can ask them for
more money.  She has raised a total of $7.5 million for her campaign,
including $2 million transferred from her congressional campaign
committee, and spent $6.2 million.  In the third quarter, she spent more than $2 million on
fundraising and donated $197,000 to the  Republican Party  of
Iowa, site of the first-in-the-nation caucuses and a contest
crucial to her chances of winning the nomination.  Representative Ron Paul of Texas raised $8.3 million,
including $500,000 transferred from his congressional campaign
account, and had $3.7 million in the bank. Paul raised $3.8
million in donations of $200 or less. He has now raised $12.8
for his campaign, behind only Romney and Perry.  Businessman Cain  Businessman Herman Cain, who won the Florida straw poll
last month, reported raising $2.6 million from July to
September, with $1.5 million of that in donations of $200 or
less. Cain loaned his campaign another $175,000, bringing his
total personal investment to $675,000. Including his second-
quarter fundraising, he has brought in $4.7 million for his
campaign. He had $1.3 million cash-on-hand.  Former House Speaker  Newt Gingrich  of  Georgia  reported
debts of $1.2 million, including $451,946 to an air travel firm
and $69,847 to himself for travel. His campaign was $1 million
in debt at the end of June.  Gingrich raised $807,962 from July to September, bringing
his total to $2.9 million. He has spent $2.6 million and entered
October with $353,417 in the bank.  His campaign will open headquarters in Iowa,  New Hampshire 
and  South Carolina  this month, said R.C. Hammond, a spokesman.  Jon Huntsman, the former Utah governor and U.S. ambassador
to  China , loaned his campaign $2.2 million, as much as he
received from donors. His first disclosure report as a
presidential candidate showed that he raised $2.2 million
through September and had $327,615 in the bank as of Sept. 30.
He reported spending $4.2 million and owing another $896,113.
Huntsman wasn’t required to file a second quarter report in July
because he entered the primary race on June 14.  Former Pennsylvania Senator  Rick Santorum  reported raising
$704,199 in the third quarter, bringing his total to $1.3
million. He had $200,000 in the bank after spending $1.1
million, including $743,757 from July to September.  Obama Bundlers  Obama’s campaign released an updated list of bundlers,
those raising at least $50,000. He is the only candidate
identifying all of his major fundraisers, those who solicit
donations from friends and bundle the donations to the campaign.  Obama’s bundler ranks rose to 351 from 244 in the second
quarter. The number of those bringing in the biggest sums, more
than $500,000, rose to 41 from 27 in June.  Additions include two fundraisers who helped raise more
than $500,000 for Obama’s 2008 campaign --  Robert Wolf , Americas
chairman of UBS AG and a member of Obama’s Council on Jobs and
Competitiveness, and Matthew Barzun, the 2012 Obama campaign’s
national finance chairman and former U.S. ambassador to  Sweden .
Barzun was formerly chief strategy officer at CNET Networks Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
