The price of  palm oil  may decline as
much as 30 percent this year as supply increases, putting
pressure on producers including Golden Agri Resources Ltd., the
 Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  said in a report.  The oil is likely to reach 2,500 ringgit ($821) a metric
ton by the end of this year with the market being in excess
surplus from July, RBS analyst John Rachmat said in the report
dated May 18. Crude palm oil futures reached a 35-month high of
3,967 ringgit a ton on Feb. 10 as rains in  Indonesia  and
 Malaysia , the top two growing regions, cut yields. Prices fell
0.5 percent to 3,372 ringgit today as inventories climbed to the
highest level in six months in April.  Global output may increase 8.3 percent to about 13 million
tons in the three months from July, compared with the previous
quarter, because of improved weather, and consumption will stay
flat, Rachmat said. Demand from biofuel makers, which account
for about 10 percent of purchases, is slowing as governments cut
subsidies for non-gasoline fuels, he said.  “With looming excess supply on the horizon, and the likely
draining of speculative positions in the commodity’s financial
derivatives, we recommend investors underweight the sector,”
Rachmat said.  He initiated coverage of Golden Agri, the world’s second-
largest palm planter, with a “sell” rating. Golden Agri shares
have had a 93 percent correlation with the palm oil price since
they listed in 1997. Its shares declined as much as 2.8 percent
to $0.685 in Singapore as of 12:02 p.m.  RBS also initiated coverage on PT Astra Agro Lestari,
Indonesia’s biggest listed plantation by market value, and
 Indofood Agri Resources Ltd. (IFAR) , the palm-oil unit of Indonesia’s
biggest noodle maker, with “sell” ratings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
