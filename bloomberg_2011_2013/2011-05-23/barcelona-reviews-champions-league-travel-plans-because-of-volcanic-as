World Player of the Year Lionel Messi
and his Barcelona teammates may travel to  London  a day or two
earlier than planned for the Champions League final against
 Manchester United  in case volcanic ash disrupts air traffic.  Vice-President Javier Faus said the club is considering how
to handle the situation. The British weather agency said ash
from an eruption that began May 21 in Iceland may reach the U.K.
tonight. Barcelona had to take a 12-hour bus ride to Milan for
last year’s semifinal after ash closed European airspace.
Barcelona lost the game 3-1 to  Inter Milan .  Barcelona players are scheduled to fly to London on May 26,
two days before the final at Wembley Stadium, Faus said in an
interview after a board meeting today at which the travel plans
were discussed. The club will continue to monitor the situation,
Faus added.  “It’s not a problem for the players to go early, the
problem is for the 20,000 fans” from  Spain  who have bought
tickets for the final, Faus said. “It would be frustrating if
the stadium is half full.” Barcelona may help fans by
chartering buses, Faus added.  The eruption has so far led to the closing of Iceland’s
main international airport in Keflavik. Icelandair Group hf said
on its website it will cancel all European flights today,
affecting 6,000 passengers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
