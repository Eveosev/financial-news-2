Iran ’s crude reserves increased by
758 million barrels following the discovery of a deposit of
light oil in southern Iran,  Press TV  reported, citing Ahmad Qalebani, National Iranian Oil Co.’s managing director.  Qalebani said last week that Iran’s oil reserves reached
155 billion barrels from an earlier 151.3 billion due to the
discovery of new fields, tni opeche state-run satellite news
channel said. The report on the broadcaster’s website didn’t
specify whether today’s announced increase is in addition to or
part of the earlier figure.  The deposit off the Persian Gulf coast is located at the
Khayyam field in Iran’s southern Hormozgan province and has the
potential to produce 35,000 barrels of oil a day, Qalebani said,
according to Press TV.  Iran is the second-largest crude producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries after  Saudi
Arabia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
