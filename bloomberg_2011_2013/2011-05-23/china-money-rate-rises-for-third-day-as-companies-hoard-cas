China ’s money-market rate rose for a
third day on speculation companies are hoarding cash to make
their tax payments.  The seven-day repurchase rate touched a one-week high on
concern 43 billion yuan ($6.6 billion) of central bank bills
maturing this week won’t improve liquidity in the financial
system, said Albert Leung, a Hong Kong-based currency and rates
strategist at Citigroup Inc.  “Companies need to make their tax payments in late May,”
Leung said. “The low amount of bills maturing won’t help loosen
liquidity much. We probably won’t see the situation improve
until early June.”  The seven-day repo rate increased 62 basis points, the most
in a week, to 4.70 percent as of 11 a.m. in  Shanghai , according
to a weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. It touched 4.74 percent earlier, the highest level since
May 16.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, rose three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.57 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.83 percent government bond due January
2018 was little changed at 3.64 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  --  Andrea Wong . Editors: Andrew Janes, Ven Ram  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
