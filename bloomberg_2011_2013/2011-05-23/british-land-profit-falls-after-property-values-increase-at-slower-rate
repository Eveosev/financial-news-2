British Land Co., the U.K.’s second-
largest real estate investment trust, said full-year profit fell
26 percent after the company’s malls and office buildings
appreciated at a slower rate.  Net income for the year ended March 31 fell to 840 million
pounds ($1.4 billion), or 95.2 pence a share, from 1.14 billion
pounds, or 132.6 pence, a year earlier, the London-based
developer said today in a statement. British Land was expected
to earn about 82 pence a share, the average estimate of seven
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  The value of British Land’s real estate rose 6.9 percent in
fiscal 2011, less than the previous year’s 13.5 percent
increase, as a recovery in the commercial  property market 
slowed. The company’s biggest U.K. competitor, Land Securities
Group Plc, reported a 14 percent gain in earnings last week.  “British Land’s results look pedestrian” compared with
those of Land Securities, Graham Jones, an analyst at Arbuthnot
Securities, said in a note to investors. Jones doesn’t have a
rating on the stock.  British Land fell as much as 3.8 percent in  London , the
biggest decline in six months. The shares were down about 3
percent at 575 pence at 9:30 a.m. in London, more than the FTSE
100 Index’s 1.6 percent drop. They’ve gained about 19 percent in
the past six months.  Cheesegrater Tenant  The REIT is spending 1.1 billion pounds to build 2.2
million square feet (204,000 square meters) of office properties
in central London by 2014, to take advantage of a shortage of
space. Chicago-based insurance broker  Aon Corp. (AON)  last week agreed
to become the first tenant in the skyscraper known as the
Cheesegrater, which British Land is developing with Toronto-
based Oxford Properties Group Inc. in the  City of London 
financial district.  “Our strong letting performance across our portfolio shows
clearly that there is still demand from occupiers for the well-
located prime retail and London office assets,” Chief Executive
Officer Chris Grigg said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
