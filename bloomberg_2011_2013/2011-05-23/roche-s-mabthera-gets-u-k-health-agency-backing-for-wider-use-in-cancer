Roche Holding AG (ROG)  won the backing of
the U.K.’s health-cost agency for expanded use of its MabThera
medicine against a common form of blood cancer.  The  National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 
supports MabThera’s use as an initial maintenance treatment in
patients with follicular lymphoma, the Basel, Switzerland-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement. The medicine would
be given to patients who have responded to previous treatment
with MabThera combined with chemotherapy.  The company provided information showing that MabThera,
also called rituximab, can prevent the spread and growth of the
cancer by three to four years, according to an e-mailed
statement from the agency. That persuaded an advisory panel to
back the drug as a cost-effective therapy after declining to
support its use in treatment guidelines drafted in March, the
agency said.  MabThera  won European regulatory approval in October for
the initial maintenance treatment of patients with follicular
lymphoma. The medicine is approved for rheumatoid arthritis and
chronic lymphocytic leukemia in addition to non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma. MabThera generated 6.36 billion Swiss francs ($7.2
billion) in sales for Roche last year.  The agency, which advises the U.K.’s  National Health
Service  on the cost-effectiveness of treatments, will make a
final recommendation on whether the state-run medical system
should pay for the medicine after a public consultation period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
