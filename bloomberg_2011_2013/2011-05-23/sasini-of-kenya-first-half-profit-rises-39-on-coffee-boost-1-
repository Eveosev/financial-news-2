Sasini Ltd. (STCL) , a Kenyan tea and coffee
producer, said first-half profit increased 39 percent on higher
coffee prices and a “favorable” exchange rate.  Net income rose to 423.5 million shillings ($5 million) in
the six months through March compared with 304.1 million
shillings a year earlier, the company said in a statement
published in the Daily Nation newspaper today.  Arabica coffee, which  Kenya  produces, rallied 45 percent in
the period while the shilling depreciated 2.7 percent against
the dollar. The nation is the world’s biggest exporter of black
tea. Sasini’s sales fell 4.5 percent to 1.26 billion shillings
as production volumes dropped, it said.  “The decrease is due to reduced production volumes in both
tea and coffee caused by a significant reduction in rainfall,”
the company said. “Substantially improved international coffee
prices and a more favorable  exchange rate ” offset the fall in
production.  Kenya had a prolonged dry spell following “extremely
poor” rainfall during its short October to December rainy
season, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, known as
Fewsnet, said on Feb. 23.  Coffee and tea prices are expected to remain high in the
second half of the year while insufficient rainfall may pose a
challenge during the period, it added.  Sasini directors have declared an interim dividend of 0.50
shilling a share.  The company’s shares extended gains for a fourth day,
climbing 4.6 percent to 11.40 shillings by the 3 p.m. close in
the capital, Nairobi, the highest level since Feb. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
