Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite warned the government to resist turning the 2012
budget plan into a pre-election spending campaign.  “This can’t become a collection promises” before the
voting, Grybauskaite said in a statement broadcast on radio
 Lietuvos Radijas  today.  The Baltic nation’s government has to pass measures equal
to 1.25 percent of gross domestic product to meet its budget-
deficit target of 2.8 percent of GDP next year, the
 International Monetary Fund  said on May 19. A general election
is scheduled in  Lithuania  for October 2012.  The government should restore pensions as planned to levels
last reached before the global financial crisis and raise the
minimum wage in 2012 as the economy expands, Grybauskaite said.
The IMF estimates that the pension increase will boost spending
by 0.6 percent of GDP.  The government said today it plans to keep a freeze on
public workers’ salaries next year after an 8 percent cut in
2009.  The economy expanded 6.9 percent in the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
