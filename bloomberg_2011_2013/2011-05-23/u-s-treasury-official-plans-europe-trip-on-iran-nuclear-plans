The  U.S. Treasury ’s official in
charge of curbing terrorism financing will visit Germany,
Switzerland and the U.K. this week as part of the Obama
administration’s efforts to pressure Iran on its nuclear program.  Iran has failed “to live up to its international
obligations and engage meaningfully with the international
community regarding its growing concerns with  Iran’s nuclear
program ,”  David Cohen , the acting undersecretary for terrorism
and financial intelligence, said in a statement on the Treasury
Department’s website today. He also said the U.S. and European
Union need to “remain vigilant” in enforcing sanctions.  Cohen said in the statement the Treasury welcomes the
strengthened sanctions the EU announced today against Iran over
its nuclear program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
