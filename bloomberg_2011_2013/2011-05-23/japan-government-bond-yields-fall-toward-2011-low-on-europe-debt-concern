Japan ’s 10-year bond yields were two
basis points from this year’s low as concern that Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis will deepen boosted demand for the
relative safety of government debt.  Bond futures held onto last week’s gain as the defeat of
 Spain ’s ruling party in local elections raised speculation that
opposition will grow to austerity measures enacted to reduce
nation’s deficit. Twenty-year debt slumped, snapping a two-day
gain, on concern demand will fall at a 1.1 trillion-yen ($13
billion) auction of the securities on May 26.  “There is still room for yields on medium-term bonds to
fall,” said  Akitsugu Bandou , a senior economist in  Tokyo  at
Okasan Securities Co., one of the 24 primary dealers obliged to
bid at government debt sales. “ Europe ’s debt problems will
continue to emerge.”  The benchmark 10-year yield was unchanged at 1.125 percent
as of 3:48 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.1 percent security due
March 2021 traded at 99.778 yen. The yield touched 1.105 percent
on May 16, the lowest since Nov. 24. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery dipped 0.03 to
140.79 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange after
advancing 0.25 on May 20. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average slid 1.5
percent.  Spain’s opposition People’s Party won 38 percent of the
vote in municipal elections yesterday, compared with 28 percent
for the ruling Socialist party, with 99 percent of ballots
counted, the Interior Ministry said. The country is struggling
to curb the euro region’s third-largest budget deficit and avoid
following  Greece , Portugal and Ireland in accepting a bailout.  Auction Ahead  Ten-year Treasury yields retreated three basis points to
3.11 percent today. Greece’s credit rating was cut three levels
by Fitch on May 20, while Italy had its credit outlook changed
to negative by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services.  Yields on Japan’s 20-year debt rose two basis points to
1.935 percent. The prior sale of the securities on April 21 drew
bids valued at 2.92 times the amount on offer, compared with the
average of 3.65 for the past 10 auctions.  “There is a sense of caution in the market about high bond
prices,” said Okasan’s Bandou. “The point is whether the
auction of 20-year debt will pass smoothly with the current
yields.”  Primary dealers often reduce holdings of bonds in case
prices decline before they can pass on the new securities to
investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
