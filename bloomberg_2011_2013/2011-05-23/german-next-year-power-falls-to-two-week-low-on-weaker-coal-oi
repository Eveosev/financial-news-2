German electricity for delivery next
year fell to its lowest in more than two weeks as fuel prices
declined, signaling lower costs for power stations in  Europe ’s
biggest market.  Baseload power for 2012 dropped 55 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to 58.20 euros ($81.53) as of 6:14 p.m. Berlin time, according
to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. Baseload is delivered
around the clock.  The region’s benchmark contract is declining after it last
month climbed to its highest price since June 2009 as  Germany 
shut reactors for a safety review following the nuclear disaster
in  Japan . The contract closed as high as 60.55 euros on April 4.  Hard coal for next-year delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp weakened the most since May 17 as crude plummeted after
Europe’s sovereign debt crisis deepened, bolstering concern that
economic growth will slow and fuel consumption decline.  The contract lost as much as 1.8 percent to $126 a metric
ton. The fuel accounted for about a fifth of Germany’s power
last year. Germany also produces electricity from lignite, or
brown coal, natural gas, wind and solar plants.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including  GFI
