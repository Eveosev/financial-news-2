Harry & David Holdings Inc., the
Oregon-based gift-box retailer that began selling fruit by mail
in the 1930s, filed a recovery plan supported by holders of
about 81 percent of its senior notes.  The retailer expects to leave bankruptcy this year, after a
June hearing to approve the plan’s supporting documents, and has
secured $100 million in exit financing from  UBS AG (UBSN) , according to
papers filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington,  Delaware .  The proposed plan, filed May 18, includes the investment of
$55 million of new equity through a rights offering to holders
of senior notes. A group of Harry & David’s existing noteholders
agreed to backstop the offering by buying shares at $75 each
when the plan takes effect, court papers show.  Harry & David, based in Medford,  Oregon , sought court
protection on March 28 after reaching an agreement with lenders
to trim debt that includes almost $200 million in bonds. The
company, owned by investment funds controlled by Wasserstein &
Co., listed assets and debt of as much as
$500 million each in its Chapter 11 petition.  Under the reorganization plan, senior notes and some
general unsecured claims will be converted to new equity. Harry
& David failed to make interest payments due March 1 on about
$58.2 million in senior floating-rate notes and more than $140
million in senior fixed-rate notes, according to  Standard &
Poor’s .  The case is In re Harry & David Holdings Inc., 11-10884,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
