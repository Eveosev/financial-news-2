U.S. state attorneys general are
sharpening their inquiries into mortgage-business practices by
looking for misdeeds when banks originated home loans and
packaged them into securities, the Wall Street Journal reported,
citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has
issued subpoenas to four bond-insurance companies,  Ambac
Financial Group Inc. (ABKFQ) ,  Assured Guaranty Ltd. (AGO) ,  MBIA Inc. (MBI)  and
 Syncora Holdings Ltd. (SYCRF) , as part of his investigation, the
newspaper said.  While the four companies have been asked to provide
information, they arenâ€™t the subject of the investigation, the
Journal said.  An MBIA spokesman said the company will comply with the
subpoena; a Syncora spokeswoman confirmed that a subpoena has
been received, while declining to comment further; an Assured
Guaranty spokeswoman declined to comment on whether a subpoena
has been received; and a spokesman for Ambac declined to
comment, the newspaper said.  California Attorney General Kamala Harris is likely to
announce today a law-enforcement drive aimed at behavior in the
mortgage business, the newspaper said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
