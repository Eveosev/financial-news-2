(Corrects quote in second paragraph to show “higher”
efficiency turbines.)  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  plans to enter the wind
power business after it agreed to acquire 40 billion won ($36
million) of convertible bonds in  South Korea ’s Unison Co.,
according to a website  statement  today.  The Tokyo-based company said the alliance will give it
distribution rights of Unison’s generators worldwide. The two
companies plan to develop “higher-efficiency” windmills.  Toshiba is targeting sales from its wind power business to
reach 20 billion yen by March 2016, company spokeswoman Kaori
Hiraki said by phone today.  Japan ’s biggest maker of nuclear reactors announced on May
19 it agreed to buy Swiss electronic-metering company Landis+Gyr
AG for $2.3 billion in cash and assumed debt to bolster its
smart-grid operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
