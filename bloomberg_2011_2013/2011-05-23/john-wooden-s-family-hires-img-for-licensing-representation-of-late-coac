The family of Hall of Fame college
basketball coach  John Wooden  has hired IMG Worldwide Inc.’s
licensing unit as its marketing representative.  IMG Licensing will manage endorsement, licensing and media
opportunities for the Wooden family, including use of the former
coach’s name, voice, likeness, image and signature, the New
York-based company said in a news release.  Wooden, who died in June at 99, coached UCLA to 10 National
Collegiate Athletic Association championships from 1964 to 1975.
He was inducted into the  Basketball Hall of Fame  in 1961.  “Our dad touched millions of people around the globe with
his simple, direct approach to life and he has provided his
children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren with a
blueprint for success that we feel should be shared with as many
people as possible,” Wooden’s children, Nan and Jim, said in a
statement.  IMG is planning to sell licensed Wooden-branded memorabilia
and apparel, and develop media properties such as films or
television shows that highlight his coaching philosophy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
