Tea production in  Kenya , the world’s
biggest exporter of the black variety of the leaves, fell 12
percent in April because of bad weather, the Tea Board of Kenya
said.  Output fell to 31.4 million kilograms (69.2 million pounds)
from 35.8 million kilograms a year earlier, the Nairobi-based
board said in an e-mailed statement today.  “Lower production compared to the same period of last year
was largely attributed to depressed and poorly distributed
rainfall occasioned by La Nina weather phenomenon,” it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
