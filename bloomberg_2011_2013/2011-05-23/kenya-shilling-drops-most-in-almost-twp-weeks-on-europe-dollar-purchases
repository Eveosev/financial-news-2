Kenya ’s shilling depreciated the most
in almost two weeks against the dollar on concern Europe’s debt
crisis will curb growth and as Kenyan companies sought to buy
the U.S. currency to settle accounts.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy weakened 1.2
percent to 86.88 per dollar by 4:47 p.m. in the capital,
Nairobi, the biggest intraday drop since May 10, from a close of
85.85 on May 20.  Emerging-market stocks slipped to a two-month low after
 Fitch Ratings  cut Greece’s credit rating by three levels on May
20, citing the challenge of fiscal and structural reform needed
to secure the state’s solvency.  Standard & Poor’s  lowered
Italy’s rating outlook to negative on the same day. The euro
depreciated as much as 1.4 percent to $1.3970, the weakest since
March 17.  “The shilling has weakened on the back a stronger dollar
in the global market due to the  Europe  debt crisis and increased
demand by businesses to settle their end-month obligations,”
John Muli, a dealer at Nairobi-based African Banking Corp., said
in a phone interview today.  Kenya’s central bank said it sold 4.7 billion shillings
($54.2 million) of  repurchase agreements  at 5.714 percent today,
after offering 5 billion shillings. It’s the ninth consecutive
trading session in which it’s sold repos in a bid to dilute the
weakening effect of its euro purchases.  Since May 10, the central bank has bought 28 million euros
($40 million) “for reserve build-up and to cover government
external payments amounting to $9.1 million made in the week,”
the Nairobi-based central bank said in a statement on May 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
