The French government increased
inventives for production of energy from biogas including
raising rates paid for electricity by 20 percent.  The plan, which will cost 300 million euros a year, is
aimed at increasing by four-fold power production from the
energy to 625 megawatts in 2020, according to a May 21 statement
from the industry and environment ministries.  France  will now recognize biogas production as a farming
activity and allow the energy to be transported through natural
gas pipelines, the statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
