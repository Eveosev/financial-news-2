Refugees from the conflict in Ivory
Coast are continuing to arrive in Togo, six weeks after the
civil war in the West African nation ended with the capture of
former President  Laurent Gbagbo .  Refugee numbers in a camp set up in Togo’s capital, Lome,
have increased to 4,800 from 2,700 on April 14, the
representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees, Ibrahima Traore, said by phone on May 20.  Most of the refugees are supporters of Gbagbo, who was
captured by forces loyal to President  Alassane Ouattara  on April
11, almost five months after a disputed election triggered the
political crisis, Traore said. Some of the refugees were
previously in  Ghana  and preferred to travel on to Togo because
it is French speaking, he said.  “I’m following the reconciliation message of Ouattara and
the evolution of the political situation of my country,”
Kouassi Constant, a refugee, said in Lome on May 20. “I’m still
scared and want to wait before taking the decision to return.’’  A new camp will be opened if the number of refugees exceeds
5,000, Traore said. Only 100 people have expressed an interest
in returning to  Ivory Coast  since the conflict ended, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
