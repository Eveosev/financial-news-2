Iceland’s central bank offered to
repurchase 15 billion kronur ($128 million) of its currency held
abroad in exchange for euros as it loosens  capital controls .  “The auction is an element in the removal of restrictions
on movement of capital as set forth in the central bank’s
capital account liberalization strategy” published March 25,
the Reykjavik-based bank said in an e-mailed  statement . Offers
to take part shall be submitted by June 7, the bank said.  Iceland has relied on capital controls to prevent a selloff
of the krona since the 2008 collapse of its biggest banks.  Offshore kronur are estimated at 400 billion kronur to 500
billion kronur, or about 25 percent of Iceland’s economy, the
bank said in March. Once the central bank has completed the
first phase, it will focus on onshore krona, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
