The Australian dollar rallied after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended investors buy commodities,
boosting prospects for the nation’s exports.  The so-called Aussie also rose against all its major
counterparts after Robert Nicholl, the head of the government’s
debt management, said the currency is gaining stature as a
reserve currency for foreign central banks.  New Zealand ’s dollar
pared yesterday’s losses.  Australia’s currency rose to $1.0530 as of 11:53 a.m. in
Sydney from $1.0505 yesterday in  New York , when it reached
$1.0479, the weakest level since April 19. It bought 86.20 yen
from 86.15 yen yesterday, when it touched 85.69, the least since
May 17. New Zealand’s dollar traded at 79.20 U.S. cents from
79.03 cents, and fetched 64.81 yen from 64.80 yen.  The  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand is set to release the
results of a business survey of two-year inflation expectations
for the second quarter today.  The South Pacific currencies strengthened as prices
rebounded for commodities, which comprise most of the nations’
exports. Copper in  London  gained as much as 0.6 percent to
$8,845 a metric ton, rebounding from a 3.1 percent decline
yesterday. Oil futures gained as much as 0.4 percent in New
York, paring yesterday’s 2.4 percent slide.  Goldman Sachs recommended investors to establish “fresh
longs” in oil, copper and zinc.  Australia’s Nicholl said at a conference in Singapore that
his nation’s terms of trade this year will be at historic highs
and twice the average level of the preceding four decades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
