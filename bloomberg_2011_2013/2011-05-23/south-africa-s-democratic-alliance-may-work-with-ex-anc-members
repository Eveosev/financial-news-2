South Africa ’s main opposition party,
the  Democratic Alliance , said it may form several local
government coalitions with a group that split from the ruling
 African National Congress .  The party is in “preliminary talks” with the Congress of
the People to jointly govern as many as eight municipalities
where it didn’t win an absolute majority, DA Federal Executive
Chairman James Selfe said in a phone interview from  Cape Town 
today. The DA took 23.9 percent of the vote in the May 18 local
government election in Africa’s largest economy.  “If you look at the election arithmetic, COPE would be our
preferred coalition partner in a number of municipalities,”
Selfe said.  COPE, formed in 2008 by a group of ANC dissidents, saw its
share of the vote plummet to 2.2 percent from 7.4 percent in
2009. The ANC’s majority slipped to 62 percent from 65.9 percent
as the white-dominated DA continued to chip away at the
governing party’s political dominance.  The DA won outright control over 18 municipalities and is
the largest party in a further 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
