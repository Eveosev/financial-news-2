Coastal regions near  Australia ’s
largest cities of Sydney and Melbourne are vulnerable to rising
sea levels and “extreme” flooding caused by global warming,
the Climate Commission said.  Sea levels may rise 0.5 meter to 1 meter (1.64 feet to 3.3
feet) by 2100, threatening areas covering much of Australia’s
population and infrastructure, according to a  report released
today by the commission , established by the federal government
earlier this year to study climate change.  “While a sea-level rise of 0.5 meter -- less than the
average waist height of an adult human -- may not seem like a
matter for much concern, such modest levels of sea-level rise
can lead to unexpectedly large increases in the frequency of
extreme high sea-level events,” the report found.  Failing to act as the atmosphere and ocean warm, ice is
lost from glaciers and rising sea levels may pose “huge risks”
to the economy, the study found. Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  aims to introduce a price on  carbon emissions  starting
in July 2012 to curb greenhouse gas pollution before a trading
system that may begin as early as 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
