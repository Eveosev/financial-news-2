Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , the
Australian energy producer seeking more  natural gas  to expand
its A$14 billion ($14.8 billion) Pluto project, reported a
discovery off the nation’s northwest coast.  The Xeres-1 well in the Carnarvon Basin intersected about
51 meters (167 feet) of gas, the Perth-based company said today
in a statement to the Australian stock exchange.  Woodside, Australia’s second-largest oil and gas producer,
is among companies building liquefied natural gas ventures in
the country to tap a projected increase in Asian demand for
less-polluting alternatives to coal. The company is trying to
stick to its target of starting Pluto exports in September and
recover from delays caused by storms, it said in April.  Woodside dropped 1.1 percent to A$45.23 at the 4:10 p.m.
close in Sydney, compared with a decline of 1.9 percent for the
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.  The company aims to have a second LNG processing unit ready
to start operations by the end of 2014, it said in January.
Woodside has been in talks to acquire supplies from other
holders of gas in the region while drilling to find more
resources.  The Australian oil producer is likely “getting close” to
having access to enough gas to support a Pluto expansion,
