Botswana’s government reopened state
junior schools today after closing them last week because of
violence during a strike by civil servants, the education
ministry said.  Most of the schools weren’t affected by the strike over
pay, the Minister of Education Pelonomi Venson-Moitoi said on
Gabz FM, an independent radio station based in the capital,
Gaborone. Senior schools remain closed, she said.  State employees in the world’s biggest diamond producer,
including teachers and nurses, have been on strike since April
18. Talks last week ended without agreement with labor unions
wanting a 12 percent wage increase and the government offering 3
percent. The government closed all state schools on May 16
because of fighting between students at senior schools and with
police.  To contact the reporter on this story:
