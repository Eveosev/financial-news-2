Asian stocks dropped, with the
regional benchmark index set for its biggest decline since March
15, as Fitch Ratings cut Greece’s credit rating and  Standard &
Poor’s  said Italy’s rating was at risk, deepening concern over
 Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , the Hong Kong-based clothier that
counts Europe as its biggest market, dropped 4 percent.  Canon
Inc. (7751) , the world’s largest manufacturer of cameras, lost 1
percent in  Tokyo . Tokyo Electric Power Co., owner of the nuclear
reactor crippled by the March earthquake, slumped 9 percent
after posting a record loss.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
largest mining company and  Australia ’s biggest oil and gas
producer, declined 1.7 percent in Sydney.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 2.2 percent to 131.67 as of
7:19 p.m. in Tokyo, heading for its lowest close since March 21.
Almost nine stocks fell for each that rose. The gauge declined
1.1 percent last week, its third straight week of declines and
the longest streak of weekly losses since November, as Greece’s
debt crisis grew,  Japan ’s economy contracted and disappointing
U.S. economic data fueled concern about a global recovery.  “The biggest concern about Europe is the risk of contagion
and of credit markets drying up globally,” said Prasad Patkar,
who helps manage about $1.8 billion at Platypus Asset Management
Ltd. in Sydney. “The memory of the global financial crisis is
fresh in everyone’s mind, and everybody’s preference is that we
don’t go there again.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average dropped 1.5 percent. South
Korea’s Kospi Index retreated 2.6 percent.  China ’s Shanghai
Composite Index slipped 2.9 percent, while  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng
Index declined 2.1 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
decreased 1.9 percent.  Vietnam Tumbles  Vietnam’s VN Index tumbled 3.5 percent to its lowest close
since July 2009. The gauge had the biggest decline among
benchmark indexes in the Asia-Pacific region after news reports
that the nation’s inflation may accelerate faster than previous
estimates.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.9
percent today. In  New York , the index lost 0.8 percent to
1,333.27 on May 20 after Gap Inc. cut its earnings forecast and
concern grew that Greece will default.  Fitch Ratings  cut Greece three levels to B+, four steps
below investment grade, from BB+. Fitch said even a “soft”
restructuring of debt being studied by European Union policy
makers would be considered a default. Fitch said Greece could
face a further reduction in its creditworthiness.  ‘Collateral Damage’  “Greece has a disproportionately large ability to cause a
lot of collateral damage,” said Platypus’ Patkar. “Credit is a
very important mechanism for quickly transmitting malaise around
the world. If Europe’s problems affect credit markets generally
it has the ability to derail the global economic recovery.”  Europe’s debt crisis is not limited to Greece. Italy’s
Treasury said it will “intensify” structural changes in the
economy and push ahead with measures to balance the budget by
2014 after Standard & Poor’s said its debt rating is at risk of
a downgrade.  Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero led his
Socialist party to its worst defeat in more than 30 years in
local elections, prompting a transfer of power in Spain’s region
that risks reviving concerns over the country’s public finances.  Esprit, which gets about 83 percent of sales from Europe,
declined 4 percent to HK$29.15 in Hong Kong.  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) ,
which operates container facilities at Piraeus, Greece’s largest
port, dropped 3.4 percent to HK$15.30. Canon, which counts
Europe as its biggest market, slipped 1 percent to 3,660 yen in
Tokyo.  Biggest Decline  Tokyo Electric slumped 9 percent to 334 yen in Tokyo, the
second-biggest decline in the regional benchmark index. The
company reported a loss of 1.25 trillion yen ($15 billion), the
biggest for a non-financial Japanese company, as it booked a 1.1
trillion yen charge related to costs for the worst nuclear
accident since the 1986 explosion at the former Soviet Union’s
Chernobyl nuclear power plant.  Japanese makers of construction machinery fell after Nomura
Holdings Inc. reduced its estimate for sales of the equipment in
China by 20 percent in the year ending in March 2012 as
government measures to cool an overheated Chinese economy will
likely weigh on demand in the construction industry. China’s
manufacturing may expand at a slower pace this month, a
preliminary reading of a purchasing managers’ index showed.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s second-biggest maker of
construction machinery, plunged 5.9 percent to 2,381 yen.
Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. declined 6 percent to 1,676
yen. Kobe Steel Ltd. dropped 3.8 percent to 176 yen. Kawasaki
Heavy Industries Ltd. lost 4.9 percent to 291 yen.  Nomura cut its share-price estimate on Komatsu by 11
percent and lowered its ratings on companies including Hitachi
Construction, Kobe Steel, and Kawasaki Heavy.  Airlines Drop  Airlines dropped after a volcanic eruption in Iceland
threatened trans-Atlantic air traffic. An ash plume from the
Grimsvotn chamber, Iceland’s most active volcano, may reach the
U.K. this week, according to the nation’s weather office. The
explosion of Eyjafjallajokull, another volcano, on April 14,
2010, closed European airspace for six days, grounding 100,000
flights at a cost of $1.7 billion, according to an estimate then
by the International Air Transport Association.  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) , Hong Kong’s biggest carrier,
dropped 2.8 percent to HK$18.04.  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA) , the
world’s second-largest airline by market value, slid 2.1 percent
to S$14.14. Korean Air Lines Co. slumped 3.5 percent to 65,500
won in  Seoul .  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , South Korea’s largest carmaker, plunged
5.4 percent to 228,000 won, the worst performance since Oct. 18,
after saying in a statement strike action at a supplier of
piston rings and cylinder liners may halt production of engines
for some models including Hyundai’s Santa Fe and affiliate Kia
Motors Corp.’s K5. Kia dropped 4.7 percent to 69,100 won, the
lowest level since April 4.  Materials Producers Retreat  Raw material producers dropped after oil and copper futures
declined on speculation demand will weaken as Europe’s debt
crisis deepens. Crude oil for July delivery fell as much as 2.5
percent to $97.64 a barrel today on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Copper for three-month delivery slid as much as 2.3
percent to $8,864 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.  BHP Billiton lost 1.7 percent to A$43.29 in Sydney. Rio
Tinto Group, the world’s second-largest mining company by sales,
retreated 1.5 percent to A$78.99. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s
biggest producer of the metal, declined 1.8 percent to HK$24.30
in Hong Kong. Cnooc Ltd., the nation’s No. 1 offshore energy
explorer, fell 1.5 percent to HK$17.86.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 2.2 percent this year
through May 20, compared with gains of 6 percent by the S&P 500
and 1.4 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 13.5 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.4 times for the S&P 500 and 11.2 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
