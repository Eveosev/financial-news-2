U.S. stock-index futures maintained
losses, signaling benchmark indexes may extend a three-week
slump, after the  Federal Reserve  Bank of Chicago’s gauge of
economic activity unexpectedly fell in April.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring next
month declined 0.9 percent to 1,315.4 at 8:34 a.m. in  New York .
Dow Jones Industrial Average futures lost 123 points, or 1
percent, to 12,343.  The Chicago Fed national index, which draws on 85 economic
indicators, was minus 0.45 in April versus 0.32 in March. A
reading below zero indicates below-trend-growth in the national
economy and a sign of easing pressures on future inflation.  U.S. futures followed European shares lower earlier after
 Spain ’s ruling party suffered its worst election defeat in 30
years and S&P warned it may downgrade Italy’s debt.  The  S&P 500  climbed to an almost three-year high on the
final trading day of April. It has slumped 2.2 percent since as
economic data began trailing estimates and investors prepared
for the Federal Reserve to complete its $600 billion bond-
purchase program at the end of June.   Citigroup Inc.’s U.S. Economic Surprise Index, which gauges
the rate at which data is exceeding or trailing estimates and
reached a record in March, turned negative in May and is at its
lowest level since August. It has risen only one day this month.  The S&P 500 is still up about 6 percent in 2011 amid
better-than-estimated profits. Per-share earnings have topped
analysts’ projections at 72 percent of the 454 companies in the
index that have released results since April 11, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.     To contact the editor responsible for this story:
