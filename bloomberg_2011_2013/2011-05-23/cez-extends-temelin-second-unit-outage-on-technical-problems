CEZ AS (CEZ) , the  Czech Republic ’s largest
power producer, will extend the outage of the second unit at its
Temelin nuclear power plant at least until the end of June
because of a technical problem.  The outage, originally scheduled to end on June 23, will be
at least a week longer after a block of protective tubes on the
inner lid of the reactor got jammed, spokesman Marek Svitak said
when reached by telephone today.  “The complications in dismantling the reactor will not
compromise security, but they will affect the length of the
outage,” Svitak said. “All consecutive maintenance work is
ready and will start after the lid is freed.”  The 1,013 megawatt reactor has off since May 6. CEZ
operates two identical units in Temelin and four smaller ones in
Dukovany.  To contact the reporter on this story:
