Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) , whose
fees to advisers have exceeded $1.26 billion during its
bankruptcy, paid lawyers and managers $27.1 million in April.  Restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal LLC, whose co-founder
 Bryan Marsal  runs the defunct investment bank, made
$431.7 million in “interim management” fees for 31 1/2 months
of work, including $8.9 million last month, according to a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Weil,
Gotshal & Manges LLP, based in New York, was paid
$293.8 million through April for acting as Lehman’s lead
bankruptcy law firm, including almost $7.9 million last month.  Lehman’s monthly fees fell from about $30 million in recent
months and as much as $45 million for November. Marsal, who
bills Lehman hourly, aims to raise $61 billion by selling the
defunct company’s assets to pay $322 billion in claims, giving
creditors 18.6 cents on the dollar, on average.  Kimberly Macleod , a Lehman spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Total administrative costs exceed $2.4 billion for the
Lehman bankruptcy, including separate liquidations of  Lehman
Brothers Inc ., the remnants of the brokerage, and Lehman
Brothers International Europe, the investment bank’s U.K. unit.  The bankrupt brokerage’s total administrative fees for the
first 24 months were $420 million, according to the SEC’s Office
of the Inspector General. London-based LBIE paid advisers $774
million in fees through March 14.  Barclays Purchase  Barclays Plc (BARC)  took on many of Lehman’s brokerage customers
and some of its trading assets when it bought the defunct firm’s
North American business in 2008.  The Lehman parent’s bankruptcy in  Manhattan  became the most
expensive in U.S. history in April 2010, when it topped the $757
million cost of energy trader Enron Corp.’s three-year
liquidation, according to data compiled by  Lynn LoPucki , a
bankruptcy-law professor at the University of California,  Los
Angeles .  In today’s SEC filing, the Lehman parent and its affiliates
reported cash and investments of almost $23 billion as of April
30, compared with $23.2 billion on March 31. Of that sum, $4.1
billion was restricted, or unavailable for use, according to the
filling. Lehman spent $957 million to settle claims with its
German affiliate, Bankhaus AG.  Liquidation Plan  Once the world’s fourth-biggest investment bank, Lehman is
fighting for control of a $61 billion liquidation plan with a
group of bondholders including hedge fund Paulson & Co. and a
rival group of derivatives creditors that includes  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  and Morgan Stanley.  Lehman creditors range from banks and hedge funds to the
New York Giants and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, as well as
individuals who hold Lehman bonds. Lehman filed for bankruptcy
on Sept. 15, 2008, with assets of $639 billion.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
