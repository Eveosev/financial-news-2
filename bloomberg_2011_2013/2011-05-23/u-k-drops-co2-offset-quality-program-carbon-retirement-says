The U.K. has canceled its program to
assure the quality of carbon-dioxide offsetting, according to
 Carbon Retirement , a company that helps polluters cut emissions.  The Department of Energy and Climate Change said it was
discontinuing the system on May 20 in letters to companies
accredited to the program, including EON AG and British Airways
Plc, London-based Carbon Retirement said today in an e-mail.  The system assured that emissions offsets bought
voluntarily were canceled or retired to prevent them from being
sold again. Other standards for voluntary credits only guarantee
that emission reductions have taken place. DECC said there was
“disappointingly low take-up” by businesses since its start in
2009, according to the e-mail.  “The scheme was designed to be self-sustaining but has had
very little public exposure since launch,” said Jane Burston,
founder of Carbon Retirement. “It’s disappointing that DECC
have decided to cancel the scheme, instead of increasing its
visibility and making the high-quality offsets it represents
more accessible.”  Businesses and individuals choose to buy such offsets as a
cheaper alternative to cutting direct emissions. Carbon
Retirement also purchases and cancels European Union permits as
a way of reducing emissions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
