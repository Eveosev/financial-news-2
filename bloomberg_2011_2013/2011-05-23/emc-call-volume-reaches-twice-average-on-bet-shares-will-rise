MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR)  call-
option trading surged after a single investor bet the shares
will rebound from the lowest level since August.  Almost 17,000 of the contracts changed hands as of 4 p.m.
in New York, triple the full-day average during the past four
weeks and 7.4 times the number of puts to sell the stock. June
$10 calls were the most-traded contracts after a block of more
than 8,500 traded at 10:24 a.m. Shares of the St. Peters,
Missouri-based U.S. energy project developer and polysilicon
supplier fell 1.3 percent to $10.17.  “The fact that shares are oversold at prior support makes
it a rebound candidate,” said Joe Kunkle, founder of
OptionsHawk.com, a Boston-based provider of options-market
analytics. “ The solar sector is one of the most oversold and
beaten-down, which is why we are beginning to see M&A activity,
a possibility for MEMC at these levels.”  MEMC declined 31 percent since Feb. 17 through last week,
compared with a 0.5 percent drop for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index. The company’s earnings excluding some items have missed
the average analyst estimates for the past seven quarters. So
far this year, $17.3 billion in deals have been announced where
the target company was in the alternative-energy industry,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The June $10 calls fell 19 percent to 56 cents today.
MEMC’s implied volatility, the key gauge of options prices, for
at-the-money options expiring in 30 days rose 8.7 percent to
43.2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
