The  Asian Development Bank  is
spending $60 million to help set up three venture capital funds
developing climate-change technology in China and India, the
Manila-based lender said in an e-mailed statement today.  The bank will invest $20 million each into Aloe Environment
Fund III, Keytone Ventures II and VenturEast Life Fund III,
which may raise an additional $700 million from the private
sector, according to the  statement .  ADB said it has invested $4.8 billion in clean energy
projects in the past three years even as climate mitigation
efforts for developing countries may exceed $100 billion a year
by 2030. Cost estimates for  Asia  may be $40 billion a year from
now to 2050, it said.  “ Climate change  will hit Asia hard in coming decades,”
Philip Erquiaga, director general of ADB’s Private Sector
Operations Department, said in the statement. “Investing in
these venture capital funds will help channel finance into
innovative and affordable technologies that tackle the challenge
of climate change.”  Aloe Fund is targeting to raise as much as 300 million
euros ($420 million) and plans to make eight to 10 investments
of about 20 million euros each, the ADB said. The $200 million
Keytone Fund will focus on technologies for light-emitting
diodes, industrial  energy efficiency , electric vehicle and power
batteries, and will make around 15 investments of $10 million to
$15 million each.  VenturEast Fund may invest $200 million in  India , making
minority investments of $5 million to $15 million in 15 to 18
companies, according to the ADB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
