Billionaire Joseph Safra, owner of
Banco Safra SA, may buy a 20 percent stake in a forest project
in  Brazil  for 160 million reais ($98 million), news website  IG 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Brazilian private equity fund Brasil Sustentabilidade may
also acquire a 20 percent stake in Eco Brasil Florestas, a
forest project that aims to plant 80,000 hectares (198,000
acres) of eucalyptus in Tocantins state, Brazil, the Sao Paulo-
based website said.  The eucalyptus would supply a future pulp plant project, IG
reported.  A spokesman for Safra in  Sao Paulo , who canâ€™t be named
because of internal policy, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
