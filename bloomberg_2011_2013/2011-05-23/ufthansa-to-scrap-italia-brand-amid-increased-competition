Deutsche Lufthansa AG will scrap its
Lufthansa Italia brand later this year after struggling to
generate a profit from the service amid increased competition
and falling prices in  Europe .  The brand will be discontinued at the end of the carrier’s
summer timetable on Oct. 29 and the airline will bundle services
to  Italy  under its main Lufthansa and Air Dolomiti brands, it
said today in an e-mailed statement. The Airbus A319 servicing
the routes will be used elsewhere in Lufthansa’s network.  “Given the slump in prices on European routes and the
competition, it was extremely difficult to establish a
profitable European network under a separate brand,” Lufthansa
Chief Executive Officer Christoph Franz said in the statement.  Lufthansa still foresees “double-digit” growth on routes
to Italy, including from Munich to cities, in northern Italy.
Lufthansa and Air Dolomiti fly to 19 Italian destinations.
Lufthansa Italia was established in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
