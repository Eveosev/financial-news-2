A leak was reported at a platform in
the  Gulf of Mexico  operated by Apache Corp., according to a
 filing  with the National Response Center.  The incident in the Eugene Island area off the Louisiana
coast occurred yesterday at 1:15 p.m. local time, the filing
showed.  “A pinhole leak beneath a riser clamp on the platform’s
departing pipeline released an unknown amount of hydrocarbons
and produced water,” it said.  U.S. companies must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.  Bloomberg News couldn’t immediately verify whether the
information in the NRC filing was accurate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
