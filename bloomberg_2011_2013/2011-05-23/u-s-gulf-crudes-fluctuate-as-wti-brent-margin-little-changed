U.S. Gulf oil grades fluctuated as
the spread between the West Texas Intermediate and Brent was
little changed.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart for July
delivery decreased 1 cent to $12.28 a barrel at 3:03 p.m. in  New
York . The differential for the contract nearest to expiration
reached a record $15.94 on Feb. 16.  When Brent gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained 15 cents to $14.35
over WTI at 2:10 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI weakened 5
cents to $13.85 a barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend weakened 25 cents to $7.60 a barrel over WTI. Poseidon’s
premium narrowed 80 cents to $7.20.  Thunder Horse’s premium gained 25 cents to $13.25 a barrel
over WTI. Southern Green Canyon’s premium weakened 30 cents to
$6.50 a barrel.  West  Texas  Sour’s discount narrowed 5 cents to $2.55 a
barrel. It has tracked more closely to its historical average
discount versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas,
away from the  Gulf Coast  and close to Cushing,  Oklahoma , the
delivery point for oil traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $12.75 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$17.25 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
