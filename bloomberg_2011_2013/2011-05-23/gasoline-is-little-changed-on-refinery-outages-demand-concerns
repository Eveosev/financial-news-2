Gasoline rose along with crude oil
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley boosted their
oil price forecasts.  Futures advanced as Morgan Stanley increased its Brent oil
2011 outlook by 20 percent to $120 a barrel and Goldman
estimated prices would hit $130. Prices also gained as the
dollar fell 0.4 percent against the euro as of 9:23 a.m. in  New
York , adding to the investment appeal of commodities.  “Goldman is calling for crude to go back up and the dollar
is starting to show signs of weakness,” said  Phil Flynn , vice
president of research at PFGBest in Chicago.  Gasoline for June delivery rose 7.19 cents, or 2.5 percent
to $3.01 a gallon at 9:45 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Crude oil for July delivery increased $1.71 to $99.41 a
barrel on the exchange.  Gasoline also gained as U.S. inventories were 16 percent
below a year earlier, according to Energy Department data. This
weekend’s three-day Memorial Day holiday period is the
traditional kickoff of the summer driving season.  “You have fairly tight gasoline supplies and the dollar
turned down today,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker
at Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut .  The department is scheduled to report last week’s
inventories at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington . Gasoline
stockpiles probably rose 500,000 barrels, according to the
median estimate of 12 analysts in a survey by Bloomberg News.  Supplies of distillate, including heating oil and diesel,
likely increased 50,000 barrels, according to the survey.  Regular retail gasoline dropped 1.5 cents to $3.828 a
gallon, AAA said on its website.  Heating oil for June delivery added 5.21 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $2.8992 a gallon on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
