SacOil Holdings Ltd., an oil and
natural gas explorer, dropped a plan to sell stock to selected
investors and said it started a probe into movements in its
securities amid concern about possible share-price manipulation.  While demand for the share sale was “substantial,”
SacOil stopped the placing due to concerns it would dilute
existing investors, recent moves in its shares and stock market
volatility, the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement
today. It has also raised concerns with the  Johannesburg Stock
Exchange  about possible short-selling of its securities.  SacOil dropped as much as 22 cents, or 17 percent, its
biggest intraday decline since Oct. 15, to 1.05 rand. It was
trading at 1.24 rand as of 9:55 a.m. in Johannesburg, extending
losses over the past three days to 16 percent, its longest
losing streak since May 6.  The company’s major shareholders have assured SacOil that
“they continue to support the company and have not been
divesting their interests in SacOil,” it said. Chief Executive
Officer Robin Vela said on April 12 that SacOil plans to raise
as much as $100 million to accelerate the development of its
projects in Nigeria.  Exploration at its Block III concession in the Democratic
Republic of Congo is “progressing well” and no further capital
outlay is needed, Vela said in today’s statement. SacOil is
fully funded for the next year to carry out its exploration
program at Blocks OPL 281 and OPL 233 in  Nigeria , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
