OAO Gazprom dropped to their lowest
since January after  Russia ’s natural-gas export monopoly was
downgraded by Credit Suisse Group AG to “underperform” from
“neutral” on “uncertainty” about tariff growth and a rising
tax burden.  The shares slumped 3.5 percent to 190.34 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, their lowest since Jan. 24.      Credit
Suisse reduced its price forecast for Gazprom to $5.30 from
$8.50, the bank said in a report e-mailed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
