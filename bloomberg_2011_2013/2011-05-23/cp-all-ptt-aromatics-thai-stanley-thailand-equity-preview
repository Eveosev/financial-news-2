Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in  Thailand  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 4:30 p.m. close in Bangkok.  The SET Index fell 18.97, or 1.8 percent, to 1,053.97, the
most since May 6.  Oil companies :  PTT Pcl (PTT)  , Thailand’s biggest energy
company, declined 2.5 percent to 352 baht.  PTT Exploration &
Production Pcl (PTTEP)  , the nation’s only publicly traded oil
explorer, lost 3.1 percent to 173.5 baht.  Crude oil declined in  New York  amid concern that  Europe ’s
sovereign debt crisis may weaken fuel demand. Crude for July
delivery lost as much as 3 percent to $97.11 a barrel in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Sri Trang Agro-Industry Pcl (STA)  , the largest publicly
traded rubber producer, fell 4.5 percent to 26.5 baht, the
lowest close since March 18. Rubber tumbled the most in more
than a week in Tokyo as a reduction in Greece’s credit rating
and a sell-off in global equities boosted concern that the
economic recovery may falter, curbing demand for the commodity
used in tires.  True Corp. Pcl (TRUE TB), the operator of the third-largest
mobile phone network, fell 4.2 percent to 4.84 baht, the biggest
drop since March 28. The company was cut to “fully valued”
from “buy” at DBS Vickers Securities (Thailand) Co., which
said it expects earnings to “deteriorate” on losses at a phone
unit. The share-price estimate was cut to 4.50 baht from 5.20
baht, the brokerage wrote in a note today.  Tipco Asphalt Pcl (TASCO)  , the biggest asphalt maker,
decreased 5.8 percent to 48.50 baht, the lowest close since Aug.
20. The company had its share-price forecast cut to 60.72 baht
from 79 baht at Asia Plus Securities Pcl, which cited rising
raw-material costs and slowing demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
