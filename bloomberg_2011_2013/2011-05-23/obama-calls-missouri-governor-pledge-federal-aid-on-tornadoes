President  Barack Obama  called
Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to offer his condolences to those
affected by the deadly tornadoes that ripped through the city of
Joplin and to offer federal assistance.  “The president assured the governor that FEMA will remain
in close contact and coordination with state and local
officials,” said Nick Shapiro, a White House spokesman,
referring to the  Federal Emergency Management Agency .  Obama called Nixon from Dublin, Ireland, where the
president is at the start of a six-day European trip, and he
directed FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate to go to Missouri to
make sure the state’s getting full federal support, Shapiro
said.  At least 89 people are confirmed dead in Joplin, the
 Associated Press  reported, citing local officials. Much of the
city’s south side was leveled, with businesses and homes reduced
to ruins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
