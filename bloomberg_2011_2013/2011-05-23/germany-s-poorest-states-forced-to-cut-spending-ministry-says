Germany ’s four poorest regions --
Bremen, Saarland, Schleswig-Holstein and the city-state of
Berlin -- have to present plans to overhaul public finances to
adhere to a balanced-budget rule from 2020, the Schleswig-
Holstein Finance Ministry said.  Keeping to the targets laid down in the five-year plans is
a pre-condition for financial aid from the federal government
and the richest of Germany’s 16 states, the ministry said today
in an e-mailed statement.  Germany’s constitutional brake on debt prohibits states
from running budget deficits in normal circumstances as of 2020.
A so-called  stability council , composed of representatives from
the federal government and the states, met today in Berlin to
monitor federal and state budgets for progress toward meeting
deficit reduction goals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
