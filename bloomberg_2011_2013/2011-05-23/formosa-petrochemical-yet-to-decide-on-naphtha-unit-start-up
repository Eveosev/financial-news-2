Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  has yet
to decide when it will start its No. 1 naphtha cracker and
whether it will carry out maintenance at a second unit,
originally planned for September.  It’s still “unclear” whether Formosa Petrochemical will
shut the No. 3 ethylene plant for work it had scheduled for the
third or fourth quarter, Lin Keh-yen, a company spokesman, said
by phone from Taipei. Maintenance was planned to last 40 days to
45 days, Lin said in March. Formosa also can’t confirm the
start-up date for the No. 1 unit, which was halted following a
fire at a pipe in the Mailiao oil refining and petrochemicals
complex, Lin said.  The suspended ethylene plant has an annual capacity of
700,000 metric tons and accounts for about 24 percent of the
refiner’s output capacity of the raw material, used in plastics
and fabrics, according to the company’s website.  The blaze also led  Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corp. (1326)  to shut
its No. 1 aromatics plant. The unit makes up 18 percent of the
company’s capacity for aromatics, used to make products
including textiles, plastic and auto parts. The facility will
resume output on May 16, the company said May 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
