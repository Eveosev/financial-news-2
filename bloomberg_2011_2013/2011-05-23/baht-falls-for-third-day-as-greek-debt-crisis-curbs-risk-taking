Thailand ’s baht weakened for a third
day as concern  Europe ’s worsening sovereign-debt crisis will
curb demand for riskier assets, making it harder for emerging
markets to attract funds.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional shares dropped to
the lowest level since March after  Fitch Ratings  cut Greece’s
credit rating by three levels last week. The baht slid the least
among Southeast Asia’s five major currencies before a report
today that economists predict will show gross domestic product
rose 2.2 percent in the three months through March from the
previous quarter, when it increased 1.2 percent. The data is due
at 9:30 a.m. local time.  “Europe’s problem is a major concern for the global
financial markets, encouraging risk-off trades,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a global economist at Mizuho Securities Co. in  Tokyo .
“Regional stocks are also down, dragging currencies lower. For
Thailand, strong growth could lead to speculation of more rate
hikes, limiting the downward move in the baht.”  The baht dropped 0.1 percent to 30.32 per dollar as of 8:10
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It may
trade between 30.20 and 30.40 this week, Hayashi said.  The yield on the 3.125 percent bond due December 2015 was
unchanged from the end of last week at 3.44 percent. The onshore
one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to receive a
floating payment, held at 3.14 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
