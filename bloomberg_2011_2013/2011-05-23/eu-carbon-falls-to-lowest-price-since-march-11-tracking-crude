European Union carbon permits dropped
to their lowest level since March 11 as futures prices for  Brent
crude , U.K. natural gas and German power declined.  EU allowances for December fell 1.5 percent to close at
16.15 euros ($22.66) a metric ton on the ICE Futures  Europe 
exchange in London. Permits have fallen 5.3 percent in the past
two weeks as  Germany  mulls whether to reopen nuclear plants and
EU regulators in Brussels discuss plans to start selling permits
for the phase that starts in 2013 and ends in 2020.  Carbon allowances may fall as low as 16 euros a ton this
week as the euro falls against the dollar on concern about
economic growth in Europe, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said.
Utilities that burn coal, which is priced in dollars, require
double the allowances compared with gas.  December contract prices may rise as high as 16.60 euros a
ton this week after hitting Fibonacci-support levels, New Energy
Finance analysts including Konrad Hanschmidt said today in an e-
mailed research note. “The market appears to be torn between
bullish technicals and bearish European debt worries, which
could become the theme for this week,” Hanschmidt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
