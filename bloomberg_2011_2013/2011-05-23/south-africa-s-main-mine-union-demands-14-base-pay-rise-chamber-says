The  National Union of Mineworkers ,
 South Africa ’s biggest labor organization, is asking for a 14
percent pay increase, more than three times the inflation rate,
according to employers represented by the Chamber of Mines.  The union’s demand for an increase in basic pay for gold
and coal miners in fiscal 2011 reflects a “disregard for the
 Consumer Price Index , which currently stands slightly above 4
percent,” Elize Strydom, chief negotiator for the Johannesburg-
based Chamber of Mines, said in an e-mailed statement today.  While gold climbed to a record $1,577.57 on May 2, gains in
the rand against the dollar are eroding profit for South African
mine operators whose costs are mostly in the local currency and
revenue is in the U.S. unit. Margins are also being restrained
by above-inflation jumps in labor and power costs. The inflation
rate was 4.2 percent in April, the government said May 17.  Gold companies are “at pains to highlight the significant
disjuncture between the gold price in dollars and the financial
situation” of mine operators, Strydom said. Labor makes up 50
percent to 55 percent of costs at gold mines, the chamber said.  Neither Frans Baleni, NUM general secretary, nor Lesiba
Sechoka, the union’s spokesman, were immediately available to
comment when Bloomberg News contacted them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
