Cotton farmers in  Burkina Faso , sub-
Saharan  Africa ’s largest grower of the fiber, lowered demands
over the price they want to be paid this season as the country’s
government urged them to start producing.  Farmers who threatened to boycott the 2011-12 season and
staged protests earlier this month want 255  CFA francs  ($0.54)
per kilogram (2.2 pounds) of cotton, less than their earlier
demand of 500 francs, as well as a reduction in the price of
fertilizer, said Nouhanga Bonzi, a spokesman for the group.  On April 26, Burkina Faso increased by 35 percent the price
farmers would be paid for cotton to 245 francs.  Agriculture Minister Laurent Sedogo, who met the farmers
today in Bobo Dioulasso, the country’s second-biggest city,
asked them to begin planting seeds amid the onset of the rainy
season.  “They must begin production and we will continue
discussions to find the solution,” he said. “If not, we all
lose.”  Lowering the price of fertilizer to the farmers’ request of
13,200 francs per bag, from the current 16,000 francs will cost
the country an extra 8.5 billion francs, Sedogo said.  Cotton for July delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1.5535 per
pound by 12:31 p.m. on the ICE Futures exchange in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
