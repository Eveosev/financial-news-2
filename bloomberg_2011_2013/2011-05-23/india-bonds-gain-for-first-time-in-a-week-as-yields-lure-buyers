India ’s 10-year bonds gained for the
first time in more than a week on speculation yields near the
highest level since 2008 will attract investors.  Overseas investors have bought $1.17 billion in rupee-
denominated debt this month, bolstering holdings to a record
$21.2 billion as of May 18, exchange data show. The yield on the
7.80 percent 10-year note climbed to 8.35 percent on May 20, the
highest level for a benchmark 10-year bond since October 2008,
after a report earlier in the week showed wholesale prices rose
more than economists estimated.  “From a medium-term perspective, current yields look good
after rising more than 50 basis points since early April,” said
J. Moses Harding, a Mumbai-based executive vice-president at
IndusInd Bank Ltd. “There are still some inflation
uncertainties in the short term but if you’re willing to buy and
hold for six to 12 months, the yields are worth it.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due April 2021 fell three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.33 percent as of
10:20 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system.  Wholesale prices rose 8.66 percent in April from a year
earlier, compared with the 8.50 percent median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, data showed May 16.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
declined. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating
rates, fell two basis points to 8.10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
