Agricultural Bank of Greece (ATE)  SA, a
state-controlled lender that failed a European Union stress test
last year, won EU approval for a restructuring plan.  The bank intends to reduce assets by 25 percent by 2013 in
return for as much as 1.14 billion euros ($1.6 billion) of
recapitalization from the Greek government, the European
Commission said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
