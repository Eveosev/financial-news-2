Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , the world’s
largest oil producer in waters deeper than 1,000 feet, started
drilling a well at its Franco field as it begins developing
reserves it bought from  Brazil ’s government for $42.5 billion.  Petrobras, as Brazil’s state-run producer is known, is
drilling in 1,863 meters (6,112 feet) of water at Franco, which
may hold 3.1 billion barrels of crude, the national oil
regulator said on its website. The company is using a rig hired
from Oslo-based  Sevan Marine ASA (SEVAN)  to drill the well.  Petrobras aims to more than double proven reserves to as
many as 35 billion barrels in the next four years as it develops
deepwater discoveries including Franco and the nearby Lula
field, which may have 6.5 billion barrels of oil. Franco and
Lula are located in Brazil’s  Santos Basin , home to the Americas’
biggest discoveries in the more than three decades.  Petrobras is adjusting its five-year investment plan to
include Franco and six other fields where it bought the rights
to produce 5 billion barrels last September as part of a $70
billion share sale, the largest in history. Petrobras plans to
invest $8 billion to $10 billion in the next five years to
explore and develop the areas, Chief Financial Officer Almir Barbassa said in a Jan. 14 interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
