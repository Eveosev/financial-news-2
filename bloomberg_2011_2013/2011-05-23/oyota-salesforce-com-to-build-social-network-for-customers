Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  Salesforce.com
Inc. (CRM)  will build a private social network for customers who will
own electric cars and plug-in hybrid vehicles being introduced
by the Japanese carmaker next year.  Toyota will invest 442 million yen ($5.4 million) and
Salesforce.com will spend 223 million yen on Toyota Media
Service Co., a Toyota subsidiary that provides data services to
drivers, the companies said today at a press conference in  Tokyo .  Automakers are adding a broader range of entertainment and
power-saving tools to entice buyers to adopt electric vehicles.
Toyota Friend, which the private social network will be called,
will connect customers with their cars, dealers and the
automaker, the companies said. One feature of the service, to be
available via smartphones and tablet computers, will notify
drivers if their vehicles are running low on battery power.  Toyota and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  said last month they will
develop in-car electronics systems that help battery-powered
vehicles run more efficiently.  Shares of Toyota fell 0.6 percent to 3,260 yen at the 3 p.m.
close of trading in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
