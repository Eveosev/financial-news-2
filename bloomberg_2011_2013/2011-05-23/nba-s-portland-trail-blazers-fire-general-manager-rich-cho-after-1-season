The  Portland Trail Blazers  fired
General Manager of Basketball Operations Rich Cho after one
season with the National Basketball Association team.  “The fit between Rich and our team simply wasn’t right,”
Trail Blazers President  Larry Miller  said today in a statement,
without elaborating.  Portland had a 48-34 record this season and lost to  Dallas 
in the first round of the playoffs. The Trail Blazers haven’t
won a postseason series since the 1999-2000 season.  Cho, 45, was hired in July to replace Kevin Pritchard, who
was fired by the Blazers the previous month.  “This decision, as difficult as it was to make, reflects
our willingness to admit and recognize that things haven’t
worked out,” said Trail Blazers owner Paul Allen, who co-
founded Microsoft Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
