The government releases its monthly
assessment of the economy after a report last week showed the
nation slipped back into recession. At least six analysts left
their ratings of Sony unchanged at neutral to buy after the
company said it had a full-year loss. Toshiba will add 700b yen
to energy and environment spending over three years, the Nikkei
newspaper reported ahead of a company briefing today.  ECONOMY
