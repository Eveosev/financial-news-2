Cocoa futures may extend a slide to
the lowest price since July 2009 as Cargill Inc. and  Barry
Callebaut AG (BARN)  resume exports from  Ivory Coast , the world’s
biggest producer.  Prices will drop to as low as $2,525 a metric ton by the
end of December, down 13 percent from the May 20 close of
$2,902, according to the average estimate of seven analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. Cocoa has slumped 23 percent since reaching a
32-year high on March 4, when a civil war in Ivory Coast
disrupted exports. Investors also are exiting, with bullish bets
by speculators dropping last week by the most in eight months.  Supplies had been disrupted since late November after Ivory
Coast’s presidency was disputed for almost five months. After
the April 11 capture of  Laurent Gbagbo , whose refusal to step
down started the conflict, shipments were slow to restart
because of chaos at banks and ports. Prices rallied 13 percent
last month, the most since July 2009.  “Cocoa prices will steadily decline into year-end with the
Ivory Coast supplies being slowly liberated,” ICAP Futures LLC
Vice President Luis Rangel said in a telephone interview from
 Jersey City ,  New Jersey .  On May 17, Cargill said its shipments from the country
would resume in the next few days.  Barry Callebaut , the world’s
largest maker of bulk chocolate, and Armajaro Trading Ltd. have
also started sending supplies.  Hedge Fund Bets  Hedge funds  and other large speculators slashed bets on a
cocoa rally by 39 percent in the week ending May 17, the most
since September, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed on May 20. Net-long positions, or bets on
higher prices, outnumbered shorts by 7,861 contracts, the fewest
since mid-January.  Shipments of  cocoa beans  registered at Ivory Coast’s ports
rose 18 percent to 15,872 tons in the 14 days to May 12 from a
year earlier, according to an industry official with access to
the data.  On May 20, cocoa for July delivery fell $77, or 2.6
percent, to $2,902 a ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Prices
have plunged since reaching a peak on March 4 of $3,775, the
highest since January 1979.  In the year that began Oct. 1, output will exceed demand by
119,000 tons, the International Cocoa Organization estimates.
This year’s harvest in Ghana, the second-biggest grower, will
reach a record 930,000 tons, according to the nation’s cocoa
board.  “Cocoa has the least compelling fundamental story of all
soft commodities,” said Spencer Patton, the chief investment
officer at Chicago-based Steel Vine Investments LLC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
