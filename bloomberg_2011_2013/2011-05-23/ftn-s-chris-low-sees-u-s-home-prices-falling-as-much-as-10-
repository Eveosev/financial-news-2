Home prices  could fall by as much as
10 percent this year, and the labor market is showing signs of
wavering, even with Federal Reserve efforts to stabilize the
economy, said  Chris Low , chief economist at FTN Financial in New
York.  “You have the Fed doing everything they can to keep the
economy running,” Low said on Bloomberg’s Television’s
“Surveillance Midday” with  Tom Keene  today.  Home prices will fall “at least 5 percent” but there’s a
greater “likelihood of 10 percent,” he said.  Data on consumer confidence, as measured by the weekly
Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, suggest many consumers believe
“we are still in a recession,” Low said. The index dropped to
minus 46.9 in the period to May 8, the weakest reading since
March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
