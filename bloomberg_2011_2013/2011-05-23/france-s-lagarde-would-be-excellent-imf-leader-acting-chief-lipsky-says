French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  would make an “excellent” head of the International
Monetary Fund, said John Lipsky, the acting managing director of
the institution.  “She’s done an excellent job as a finance minister and I’m
sure she would be an excellent managing director,” Lipsky told
CNBC television today. He said other candidates who have been
nominated and publicly mentioned also “all seem excellent
names.”  Support mounted for Lagarde to head the Washington-based
IMF after  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  resigned last week following
his arrest on sexual assault charges in New York.  Mexico has offered its central bank governor, Agustin Carstens, as an emerging-market candidate, challenging Europe’s
65-year hold on the job.  Lipsky said the IMF fund and management play no role in the
selection of the institution’s head. He said he’s confident the
recruitment process outlined by the IMF board last week will
lead to an “excellent” choice.  The IMF is co-funding bailout plans for  Greece , Ireland and
Portugal with the European Union. Asked about the risk of
default in those countries, Lipsky said that the IMF has set up
financial assistance programs that do not contemplate debt
restructuring.
