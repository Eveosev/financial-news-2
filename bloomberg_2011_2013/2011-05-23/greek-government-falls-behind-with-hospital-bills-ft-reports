The Greek government has paid just 1
percent of debt owed by public hospitals in 2011 and only 30
percent of payments owed since the start of last year, the
Financial Times reported, without saying where it got the
information. “The situation has become dramatic,” the Hellenic
Association of Pharmaceutical Companies said in a letter to the
Greek Ministry of Health, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
