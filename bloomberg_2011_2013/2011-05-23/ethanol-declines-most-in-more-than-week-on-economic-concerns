Ethanol dropped for the first time in
more than a week, falling with other energy commodities on signs
of economic weakness that may curb fuel demand.  The gasoline additive slumped as  Greece  stepped up
austerity measures to keep pace with its deficit and after the
Federal Reserve Bank of  Chicago ’s gauge of economic activity
dropped below zero in April. Ethanol, concocted from corn in the
U.S., is blended with gasoline to augment supply.  "We’re worried about the European debt and the bad
manufacturing report here," said  Dan Flynn , a trader at PFGBest
in Chicago. "That took all the commodity markets down. The
economy’s slowing down again and that’s driving everything
down."  Denatured ethanol for June delivery fell 1.9 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.65 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
first decline since May 11. Futures have gained 11 percent this
year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf gained 2
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.765 a gallon and on the West Coast
the additive increased 2 cents to $2.775, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago rose 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.66 a
gallon and in  New York  the biofuel jumped 1 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $2.755.  Average ethanol mills in  Iowa  are earning 3 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in Illinois are earning 5 cents on
a spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive, Iowa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
