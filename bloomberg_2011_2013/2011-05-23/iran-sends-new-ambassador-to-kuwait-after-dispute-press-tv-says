Iran  sent a new ambassador to Kuwait
two months after a dispute over an alleged spy network operating
in Kuwait prompted both countries to expel diplomats.  Ruhollah Ghahremani Chabok arrived in Kuwait to start his
role as head of the Iranian mission, the state-run  Press TV  news
channel said today.  In March, a Kuwaiti court sentenced two Iranians and a
Kuwaiti to death for involvement in a spy ring in the Arab
country. Iran has denied having such an operation in Kuwait.  Tension has been building between Iran and nations of the
Gulf Cooperation Council since  Saudi Arabia  and other members
including Kuwait sent forces to Bahrain in March to support the
government’s crackdown against pro-democracy protesters. Iran
condemned the troop deployment as “meddling” and warned that
the move may prove “incendiary” for the region.  The two countries will return ambassadors  “as soon as
possible,” Iranian  Foreign Minister  Ali Akbar Salehi  told
reporters in  Kuwait City  on May 18. After returning from last
week’s trip, Salehi said Iranian and Kuwaiti authorities had
cleared “misunderstandings” between the two countries,
according to Press TV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
