LinkedIn Corp., the networking
website aimed at professionals, declined 5.2 percent in New York
trading today, after more than doubling in the week of its
initial public offering.  The shares fell $4.79 to $88.30 at 4 p.m. on the New York
Stock Exchange. On May 18, LinkedIn announced the sale of 7.84
million shares at $45 apiece in its IPO, raising $352.8 million.
The underwriters of the company’s offering exercised an
overallotment option to buy more shares two days later, boosting
the offering size to $405.7 million.  LinkedIn, the first major U.S. social-media company to go
public, has a market value of $8.4 billion, or about 22 times
2011 revenue, assuming first-quarter sales are matched the rest
of the year. Even with today’s decline, investors aren’t giving
up on LinkedIn, said Clay Moran, an analyst at Benchmark Co. in
 Boca Raton ,  Florida .  “I don’t think the drop in the stock is enough to indicate
that there’s a sort of reevaluation and rethinking going on,”
Moran said. The drop is “a natural reaction to the surge in the
stock price that occurred last week, especially given the market
weakness” today.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 1.2 percent to
1317.37, while the Nasdaq index dropped 1.6 percent to 2758.90.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.5 percent to
8236.55.  LinkedIn is losing gains spurred by buyers scrambling for a
limited number of shares on the first day of trading, said
Darren Fabric, a Chicago-based managing director at IPOX Capital
Management LLC, which oversees about $2.5 billion and invests in
IPOs.  “It was up a little too much,” he said in a telephone
interview. “They didn’t offer that many shares. People are
probably taking a look and saying maybe I’ll wait. The price is
probably still a little crazy.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
