Iran ’s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
will remain caretaker at the oil ministry even after the
nation’s top legal authority said the move was unlawful,  Shargh 
reported, citing vice-president Fatemeh Bodaghi.  The government announced its decision regarding oversight
of the Oil Ministry and the matter is considered done, the
Tehran-based newspaper cited Bodaghi as saying. Bodaghi is vice-
president in charge of legal affairs.  Bodaghi made her comments on the sidelines of a cabinet
meeting yesterday after she was asked about the Guardian
Council’s May 20 ruling that Ahmadinejad should not have taken
up the post, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
