Natural gas futures gained for a
second day as forecasts showed hotter-than-normal weather in the
U.S. East and South, boosting demand for the power-plant fuel to
run air conditioners.  Gas advanced 2.7 percent as forecasters including Commodity
Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland, said temperatures will
be higher than normal through June 6. The East was cooler than
normal last week, according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State
College ,  Pennsylvania .  “We get a little bit of heat out there and you are going
to see things run up,” said Brad Florer, a trader at Kottke
Associates Inc., an energy trading firm in Louisville,  Kentucky .
“In the short term, we just can’t get outside of this range
between $4 and $4.50.”  Natural gas for June delivery rose 11.6 cents to settle at
$4.346 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices are up 7.7 percent from a year ago.  Temperatures in the East will be about 4 degrees above
normal next week, while  Texas  may see higher temperatures in the
upper 90s, according to MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg,
 Maryland .  The high in New York on May 27 may be 80 degrees Fahrenheit
(27 Celsius), 6 degrees above normal, according to  AccuWeather
Inc.  in State College, Pennsylvania. The high in  Dallas  may be
88 degrees.  Scheduled natural gas deliveries to U.S. electricity
generators rose for an eighth day on forecasts of warmer weather
that may boost air conditioner use. Shipments to the Northeast
advanced for a second day.  Pipeline Deliveries  A sample of scheduled gas deliveries to power plants in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments gained 1.5 percent to 14.9
million dekatherms (14.5 billion cubic feet), according to data
compiled by Bloomberg as of 2:44 p.m. Shipments to power
generators in the Northeast rose 16 percent to 1.7 million
dekatherms.  Power plants  use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  Gas advanced 3.3 percent on May 20, the most since April
28, as data showed the number of U.S. drilling rigs fell for a
second week.  The rig count declined 8 to 866 last week, the lowest level
since the week ended Jan. 29, 2010, according to Houston-based
Baker Hugh Inc.  “Although we believe that gas drilling activity should
have support at current levels from hedges that cover production
and from rigs targeting ‘liquids-rich’ gas, the risk is for
further reductions,” said James R. Crandell, an analyst with
 Barclays Capital  in New York, said in a note to clients today.  Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) , the Blackstone Group LP-backed owner
of a U.S. liquefied natural-gas terminal, said on May 20 that it
won government approval to export the fuel to more countries.  LNG Exports  The Energy Department will allow Cheniere’s Sabine Pass
terminal in  Louisiana  to export as much as 803 billion cubic
feet a year of U.S. gas. The decision expanded on a September
2010 ruling that permitted Cheniere to ship gas to 15 countries
with Free Trade Agreements.  The decision “paves the way for the approval of exports
from other terminals,” said Crandell.  Companies including Freeport LNG in Texas have also applied
to export LNG.  Gas stockpiles gained 92 billion cubic feet in the week
ended May 13 to 1.919 trillion cubic feet, the Energy Department
said last week.  Storage levels were down 11 percent from a year earlier,
narrowing from 12 percent the previous week, department data
showed.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
268,936 as of 2:36 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 307,000. Volume was 275,548 on May 20. Open interest was
935,423 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
945,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
