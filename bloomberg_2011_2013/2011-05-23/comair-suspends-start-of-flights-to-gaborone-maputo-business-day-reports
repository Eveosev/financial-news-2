Comair Ltd. (COM)  suspended starting
flights to Gaborone, Botswanaâ€™s capital, and Maputo in
 Mozambique , Business Day reported, citing Executive Manager for
Network Development and Alliances Stuart Cochrane.  The flights, which were due to start on May 30, have been
delayed to September as the company awaits a commitment from
Lanseria International Airport, north of Johannesburg, to build
a new runway and expand other infrastructure, the Johannesburg-
based newspaper reported.  Lanseria plans to spend 150 million rand on a new runway
and is investing more than 50 million rand in three new terminal
gates and 1,000 new parking bays, airport Managing Director
