Peru ’s sol fell after a presidential
poll showed congresswoman Keiko Fujimori and ex-army rebel
Ollanta Humala almost tied before a runoff vote in two weeks.  The sol weakened 0.1 percent to 2.7608 per U.S. dollar at
11:46 a.m. New York time, from 2.7580 on May 20.  Fujimori had 51.4 percent support and Humala had 48.6
percent backing in an Ipsos Apoyo poll published yesterday,
little changed from a week ago. The poll had a margin of error
of 2.2 percentage points.  Humala, a one-time ally of Venezuelan President  Hugo
Chavez , pledges to revise the country’s free trade agreements if
he wins the June 5 vote. Fujimori, the daughter of jailed former
president  Alberto Fujimori , favors keeping Peru’s economy open
to foreign investment.  “I’ve been reluctant to trade Peru,” said  Eduardo Suarez ,
an emerging markets strategist at RBC Capital Markets in
Toronto. “I marginally lean towards Keiko being more likely to
win, but things are priced for that. If she doesn’t win, the
downside is greater than the upside from a Keiko victory.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
