India’s stocks fell, dragging down
the benchmark index to a two-month low amid signs  Europe ’s debt
crisis is worsening and as Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee
signaled concern about inflation.  Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) , India’s largest maker of
power equipment, tumbled 7 percent, the most in 30 months, after
approving the sale of a 5 percent stake held by the government.
 State Bank of India (SBIN) , the biggest lender, sank to its lowest
level in almost 12 months.  Indian equities tracked the biggest drop in Asian stocks in
two months after  Fitch Ratings  lowered  Greece ’s credit rating
and Standard & Poor’s said Italy’s rating was at risk. Inflation
is a “major challenge” in the short term, Mukherjee told a
banking industry meeting on May 21 in Mumbai.  “The pressure of the interest-rate cycle going up and the
stickiness of inflation continues to weigh on the markets,”
said Sadanand Shetty, a  fund manager  at Taurus Asset Management
Co., which manages $566 million in assets. “The global sell-off
due to the European crisis has added to the concerns.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index lost 332.76, or
1.8 percent, to 17,993.33 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, its
lowest close since March 22. The gauge lost 1.1 percent last
week after the biggest gasoline price increase since 2008 fanned
concerns inflation will accelerate and prompt the central bank
to raise  interest rates  further. A panel of ministers on diesel
prices will meet this week, farm minister Sharad Pawar said in
New Delhi today.  Nifty Index  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of
 India  Ltd. lost 1.8 percent to 5,386.55 and its May futures
settled at 5,383.5. The BSE 200 Index fell 1.7 percent.  The Sensex has fallen 12 percent this year on concern
higher borrowing costs will hurt corporate earnings. Stocks on
the gauge are valued at an average 14.4 times estimated profit,
down from 21.5 times in March 2010, last year’s high. The MSCI
Emerging Markets Index trades at 10.9 times earnings.  All but one of the 30 Sensex stocks retreated. Bharat Heavy
sank 7 percent to 1,931.75 rupees, the biggest decline since
Nov. 11, 2008. The company’s board approved the stake sale and a
proposal to divide each share into five, according to an
exchange filing. The government holds 68 percent of the company,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The offer is likely to be priced at a discount to the
current price to attract strong investor interest and build
appetite for a large-sized issue,” said Sunil Pachisia, vice
president with Pratibhuti Viniyog Ltd. “The stock correction is
in anticipation of the discount sale.”  Lenders Slide  State Bank  tumbled 3.1 percent to 2,249.75 rupees, the
lowest price since June 1, while  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the nation’s
largest private lender, lost 3.5 percent to 1,006.9 rupees.
 Reliance Infrastructure Ltd. (RELI) , owned by billionaire Anil Ambani,
lost 3.7 percent to 548.2 rupees. Sterlite Industries (India)
Ltd., the biggest copper producer, dropped 3.3 percent to 162.65
rupees.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the biggest truckmaker and owner of
Jaguar Land Rover, lost 3.4 percent to 1,129.45 rupees.  Maruti
Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the biggest carmaker, dropped 1.6 percent to
1,203.75 rupees. Its May futures settled at 1,197.10 rupees.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 2.2 percent, heading for
the biggest drop since March 15. Fitch Ratings cut Greece three
levels to B+, four steps below investment grade, from BB+. Fitch
said even a “soft” restructuring of debt being studied by
European Union policy makers would be considered a default.  Italy’s Treasury said it will “intensify” structural
changes in the economy and take steps to balance its budget by
2014 after  Standard & Poor’s  said its rating is at risk of being
lowered.  Rising Prices  India’s central bank on May 3 increased rates for a ninth
time since March 2010 to curb rising prices, and Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao predicted inflation will stay “elevated”
until September. Monetary tightening will slow growth this year
and help ease inflation to 6 percent “with an upward bias” by
March 31, 2012, he said.  Import costs for India, which buys almost three-quarters of
the oil it uses from overseas, surged to a one-year high of $9.4
billion in March. Crude has climbed almost 40 percent in the
past year as unrest in the Middle East and North Africa toppled
leaders in Tunisia and Egypt.  India’s wholesale-price index climbed 8.66 percent in April
from a year earlier after an 8.98 percent gain in March, the
commerce ministry said on May 16. By comparison, consumer prices
rose 5.3 percent in  China , 9.6 percent in  Russia , 6.5 percent in
 Brazil  and 4.1 percent in  South Africa .  ‘Sacrifice Growth’  “What is stopping investors from being gung-ho is the
policymakers’ view that they are ready to sacrifice some growth
to control the inflation monster,”  Jagannadham Thunuguntla ,
chief strategist at SMC Global Securities Ltd., said by phone
from  New Delhi . “There are unmistakable signs of a slowdown in
the economy. Most of the corporate results have just been in
line with expectations. Positive surprises are rare and few.”  Overseas investors sold a net 71 million rupees ($1.6
million) of Indian stocks on May 19, taking total outflows from
equities this year to 29 billion rupees, according to data on
the  website  of the Securities and Exchange Board of India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
