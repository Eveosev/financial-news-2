Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) , the second-
largest U.S. cable company, is close to hiring Irene Esteves as
chief financial officer, said a person familiar with the matter.  The two sides are near a final agreement, though the deal
still requires approval by the New York company’s board, said
the person, who asked not to be identified because the decision
isn’t final.  XL Group Plc (XL) , the Dublin-based company where
Esteves has been CFO, confirmed today in a statement that she
will be leaving the company “following a transition period.”  “Irene has been presented with an extraordinary
opportunity,” said Mike McGavick, XL’s chief executive officer,
in the statement.  Esteves has been CFO at XL since May 2010, according to a
company statement released when she was hired. From 2008 to
2010, she held the same role at  Regions Financial Corp. (RF) , and she
served as CFO of Wachovia Corp.’s capital management group from
2006 to 2008. Esteves has more than 20 years of experience in
strategic M&A and investment risk management at U.S. and global
companies, according to the XL Group  statement .  Rob Marcus has acted as Time Warner Cable’s CFO and chief
operating officer since December, when former COO Landel Hobbs
was terminated without cause, according to a proxy statement
released last month.  Time Warner Cable fell 35 cents to $77.64 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have risen 18
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
