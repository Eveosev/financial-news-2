Spain ’s Gamesa Corporacion
Tecnologica SA topped Vestas Wind Systems A/S, the world’s
biggest wind-turbine maker, in new installations in  India  in the
financial year ended March 31, the latest figures show.  Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , India’s biggest wind-turbine maker, saw
its share drop below 50 percent for the first time, according to
data from the Indian Wind Turbine Manufacturers Association sent
to Bloomberg News.  The contest for new installations in India is intensifying
as European manufacturers seek faster growth outside their home
market. India installed the most new wind capacity last year
behind China and the U.S.  Of the 2,351 megawatts of capacity added in India last
year, Suzlon was still the top supplier taking 41 percent of new
installations, or 955 megawatts, according to the IWTMA figures.
The local unit of  Germany ’s Enercon GmbH kept its No. 2 ranking
with 504 megawatts.  Gamesa, 18 months since entering the Indian market, has
become the third-biggest supplier with 228 megawatts, or 10
percent. Vestas slipped one spot to No. 4 with 215 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
