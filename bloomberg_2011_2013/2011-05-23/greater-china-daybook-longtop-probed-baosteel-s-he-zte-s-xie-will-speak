Longtop Financial Technologies Ltd.,
a Hong Kong-based maker of financial software, said auditor
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd. resigned and a U.S. regulator
started a probe of the company’s financial reports.  The probe of Longtop, which has been suspended in New York
trading since May 17 as it delayed filing its annual report,
represents an expansion of regulatory scrutiny beyond smaller
Chinese companies listed in the U.S. by reverse mergers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
