The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of
commodity-shipping costs, rose to a six-week high on increased
rates to charter capesize vessels that mostly haul  iron ore  to
make steel.  The index rose 1.5 percent to 1,369 points, data from
the  Baltic Exchange  in  London  showed. That’s the highest since
April 8. Rents for capesizes jumped 4 percent to $8,065 a day
and have climbed 43 percent in the past four days.  Capesize’s gained “due primarily to a minor shortage of
vessels in the Atlantic basin,” Natasha Boyden, a Cantor
Fitzgerald LP analyst in  New York , said in an e-mailed
report. “This is likely just a temporary change and any
ballasting of vessels in the Pacific could offset the rise.”
Ballasting is sailing a ship empty.  Capesizes are the largest ships tracked by the Baltic
Dry Index, and the cheapest as fleet expansion pushed rents 60
percent lower this year. Companies ordered too many vessels in
2007 and 2008, when the index averaged 6,730 points. The average
then plunged 60 percent over the next two years.  Carrying capacity of the capesize fleet will increase 16
percent this year, faster than a 7 percent rise in demand for
iron ore according to forecasts from  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the biggest
shipbroker.  Daily rents for panamaxes that compete with capesizes for
cargoes and also transport grains, gained 2.7 percent to $13,724
a day. Supramaxes gained 0.2 percent to $14,804 while handysizes
were little changed at $11,649.  To contact the reporter on this story:
