Croatia  and the European Union may
complete the Balkan nation’s accession talks by June, Hungarian
Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi said.  “There’s a chance to conclude the accession talks by the
end of the Hungarian EU presidency’s term,” Martonyi said in
interview on the office’s  website  published over the weekend.
“We’re close to the finishing line, only the last meters are
left, which require special efforts from everyone.”  EU officials will hold detailed discussions on the state of
Croatia’s accession during a working dinner of the General
Affairs council on May 23, Martonyi said, according to remarks
published on the website. Hungary’s term as the rotating
president of the EU ends as of July 1.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
