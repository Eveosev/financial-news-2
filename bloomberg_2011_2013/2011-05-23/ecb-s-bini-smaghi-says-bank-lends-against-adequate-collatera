European Central Bank Executive Board
member Lorenzo  Bini Smaghi  said the bank provides financial
institutions with liquidity against “adequate” collateral.  “We have a statute and we have a general documentation for
lending,” Bini Smaghi told reporters in Vienna today. “We have
to lend to sound counterparties and against adequate collateral.
That says it all.”  Bini Smaghi also said the ECB is monitoring the risk of
faster inflation feeding into higher wages and inflation
expectations “very closely.” At the same time, policy makers
should be “very careful” not to “over-interpret” market-based
inflation expectations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
