CMC Holdings Ltd. (CMCH) , Kenya’s fourth-
biggest auto dealership by sales, said first-half profit fell
0.7 percent as revenue declined.  Net income dropped to 187.6 million shillings ($2.19
million) in the six months through March from 188.9 million
shillings a year earlier, the Nairobi-based company said in a
statement in the Daily Nation newspaper today. Sales fell 9.6
percent to 6.19 billion shillings after the company
“minimized” sales on credit and because of lower orders from
the Kenyan government, it said. CMC sold 1,202 vehicles and
tractors during the period compared with 1,272 a year earlier,
the statement said.  “Based on the sales prospects at the end of this period,
the group expects increased sales in the second half of the
financial year,” the statement added.  Vehicle sales in East Africa’s largest economy in the first
four months of the year climbed to 3,865, up 11 percent from the
same period last year, the  Kenya Motor Industry Association  said
May 11. Vehicle sales fell to 938 units last month from 947 in
April 2010, the Nairobi-based association said, without giving a
reason for the decline.  CMC is  Kenya ’s fourth-biggest car dealer after  General
Motors East Africa Ltd. ,  Toyota East Africa Ltd.  and  D.T. Dobie
Ltd. , according to data e-mailed to Bloomberg News by the Kenya
Motor Industry Association. The company used to be the second-
largest.  CMC appointed Mary Ngige as acting chief executive officer
on March 15 after Martin Forster left the company as part of a
“normal restructuring” exercise, and named Peter Muthoka
chairman on April 5 following the resignation of Jeremiah
Kiereini.  The company’s shares fell for the first day in three,
losing 0.5 percent to 10.6 shillings at 12:12 p.m. in Nairobi.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
