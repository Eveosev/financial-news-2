The cost of buying land to build
nuclear reactors may increase by as much as 10 percent because
the earthquake and tsunami in  Japan  on March 11 will force
developers to buy in safer areas, according to the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development’s  Nuclear Energy
Agency .  Luis Echavarri, the agency’s director general, spoke on May
17 by phone from Paris.  On nuclear land costs:  “I think the cost associated to the location could
increase. You need locations better protected against
earthquakes, tsunamis and floods. You will have to build plants
at higher elevation than the sea and river levels. I think we
are talking of something between 5 and 10 percent, but that is
very significant.”  Impact on nuclear policy:  “In the short term, it’s clear that Fukushima has had a
big impact on policymaking and in societies. The countries which
were ready to launch more reactors will be taking some time to
do that. Italy and  Chile  are typical examples.”  “These types of countries will be waiting. The countries
who had reactors under construction will be continuing with
these reactors. But they will have to understand Fukushima
better, to understand what the impact it will have.”  Nuclear in the long term:  “In the long term, nuclear will remain a very important
pillar for energy diversity, security of supply and limiting the
emissions of CO2. I don’t think Fukushima questions the use of
nuclear power as a whole.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
