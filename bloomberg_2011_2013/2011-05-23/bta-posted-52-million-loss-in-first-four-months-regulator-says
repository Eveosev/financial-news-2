BTA Bank, Kazakhstan’s biggest lender
before the global credit crisis, had a loss in the first four
months of the year, the nation’s financial regulator said.  BTA posted a loss of 7.6 billion tenge ($52 million),
compared with a 45.4 billion tenge loss in the same period a
year earlier, the Almaty-based central bank’s financial
oversight committee said in a monthly report on its  website . The
figures are based on unconsolidated data calculated in
accordance with Kazakh accounting standards. The bank had a
profit of 918 million tenge in the first quarter of the year.  BTA’s liabilities exceeded assets by 105 billion tenge at
the end of last year after its 2010 revenue rose to $6.7
billion, bolstered by $5.8 billion from debt restructuring, the
lender said in its full-year earnings report published May 12
and calculated under international accounting standards.  The bank, which defaulted in April 2009, two months after
it was taken over by sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna, will
only use profit from operations to bolster its capital, Chief
Executive Officer Anvar Saidenov said May 20.  Olzhas Beisembayev, an Almaty-based spokesman for BTA Bank,
declined to comment immediately.  The following table shows the four-month performance of
 Kazakhstan ’s six largest lenders, along with 14th-ranked
Temirbank, and their position as of May 1. The data from the
oversight committee are in billions of tenge:  To contact the reporter on this story:
