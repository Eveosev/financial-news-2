The following is the text of the
Electric Power Flash report from the U.S. Department of Energy:  The contiguous  United States  experienced temperatures that were
slightly above normal in March 2011.  Accordingly, the total
population-weighted heating degree days for the United States
were 1.2 percent below the March normal.  Retail sales of electricity decreased 0.2 percent from March
2010.  Over the same period, the average U.S. retail price of
electricity increased 1.1 percent.  For the 12-month period
ending March 2011, the average U.S. retail price of electricity
increased 1.6 percent over the previous 12-month period ending
March 2010.  In March 2011, total electric power generation in the United
States increased 1.2 percent compared to March 2010 (the change
in electric power generation does not necessarily coincide with
the change in retail sales of electricity because utility
billing cycles tend to lag electricity production in many areas).
Over the same period, coal generation decreased 7.2 percent,
while natural gas generation increased 1.7 percent and petroleum
liquids generation increased 1.0 percent.  Conventional
hydroelectric generation had the largest percentage change,
increasing 52.1 percent from the previous year.  This was mainly
due to record amounts of precipitation that fell in the
Northwest region during March 2011.  Total coal stocks increased 3.2 percent from February 2011 as
coal plants begin the spring build-up of coal for consumption in
the summer months.  Accordingly, the average number of days of
burn for coal plants consuming bituminous or subbituminous coal
as their primary fuel increased from the previous month.  SOURCE: U.S. Department of Energy
