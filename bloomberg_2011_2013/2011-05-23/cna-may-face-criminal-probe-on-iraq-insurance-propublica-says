CNA Financial Corp. (CNA) , the Chicago-
based insurer, may face a criminal investigation tied to its
failure to pay benefits to the survivors of Iraqi translators
killed while working for the U.S., ProPublica  reported .  The insurer was ordered by an administrative law judge to
begin making payments to the families of the slain translators,
ProPublica said, citing a ruling. The judge, Daniel Solomon,
asked the Labor Department to investigate whether criminal
charges are appropriate, ProPublica said.  CNA withheld information and avoided making payments to
nine families who lost loved ones in a 2006 attack, ProPublica
said, citing files and interviews. Lawyers for the families said
the company owed about $500,000, while CNA instead paid $45,000
into a federal fund, according to ProPublica.  CNA is investigating the matter, said Katrina Parker, a
spokeswoman for the insurer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
