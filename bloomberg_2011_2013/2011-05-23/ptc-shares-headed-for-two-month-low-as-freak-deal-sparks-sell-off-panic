PTC India Ltd. (PTCIN) , the nation’s biggest
power trader, declined to the lowest level in two years after a
“freak deal” sparked a sell-off in the stock.  About 194,000 shares changed hands at 68.05 rupees on the
National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. at 9:48 a.m. in Mumbai, 20
percent below its previous close, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The volume is 11 percent of the 1.8 million shares traded
at the 3:30 p.m. close. Indian exchanges are required by the
regulator to reveal names of the buyers and sellers when the
number of shares in a single trade exceeds 0.5 percent of the
company’s equity capital.  “There’s panic among investors due to the apparent freak
deal,” Sachin Mehta, an analyst with IFCI Financial Services
Ltd., said by phone from Mumbai. The decline “has worsened the
sentiment as the stock is underperforming the Sensex.”  The stock tumbled 6.9 percent to 79.2 rupees, the lowest
price since May 21, 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
shares have declined 31 percent in the 12 months through May 20,
compared with a 9.4 percent advance in the 30-stock Bombay Stock
Exchange Sensitive Index.  “It makes no sense to me,” Deepak Amitabh, chief
financial officer of PTC, said by phone. “Why would anyone sell
at that price when the stock has been trading in the 75 rupees
to 100 rupees range in the past three months.”  The National Stock Exchange doesn’t “look at data
intraday,” spokeswoman Divya Malik Lahiri said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
