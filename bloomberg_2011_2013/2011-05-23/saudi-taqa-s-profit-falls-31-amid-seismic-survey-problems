Saudi Arabia ’s Industrialization &
Energy Services Co. recorded a 31 percent decrease in annual
profit partly because of problems it faced conducting seismic
surveys in the country’s Rub al-Khali desert.  The company, known as TAQA, earned 84 million Saudi riyals
($22.4 million) in 2010 compared with profit of 122 million
riyals in the previous year, it said in its annual report, a
copy of which Bloomberg saw today. TAQA generated annual revenue
of 2 billion riyals, down 4 percent from 2009, according to the
report. TAQA is owned 45 percent by the government.  A subsidiary, Arabian Geophysical & Surveying Co.,
encountered “big challenges” making surveys “in the harsh and
difficult Shaybah area” in the Rub al-Khali in southern Saudi
Arabia, said the report, which was published last week.
International companies such as OAO Lukoil,  Eni SpA (ENI)  and  China
Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , known as Sinopec, have reported
difficulties finding natural gas in the Rub al-Khali, or Empty
Quarter, under contracts awarded by  Saudi Aramco , the world’s
largest oil exporter.  TAQA’s Air Liquide Arabia venture will build a $450 million
plant with a capacity of 262 million cubic feet a day to supply
hydrogen gas to Aramco in the port of Yanbu. The plant will
begin operating in 2014, the annual report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
