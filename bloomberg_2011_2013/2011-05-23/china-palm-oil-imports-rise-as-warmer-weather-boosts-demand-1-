China’s  palm oil  imports, the world’s
second-biggest, rose to the highest level this year in April as
warmer weather boosted demand for the cooking oil.  Imports last month jumped 38 percent from March to 453,089
metric tons, according to data released today by the General
Administration of Customs.  “Imports generally rise starting in April each year
through the summer, and some of the shipments were bought”
before the current weak demand in the cooking oil market,
according to Cao Yanhui, analyst at Guoxin Futures Co. As warmer
summer weather makes palm oil flow easier, its use increases, so
the gain in shipments is seasonal, Cao said by phone from
Dalian. Still, shipments declined 14.8 percent from a year ago,
customs data show.  China  has imposed a price-freeze on cooking oils and
tightened lending to tame inflation, which last month neared the
highest in more than two years. Palm oil futures traded on the
 Dalian Commodity Exchange  has lost 6.7 percent this year, while
the commodity in  Malaysia  declined 11 percent.  The price controls imposed on companies including Cofco
Ltd. and Wilmar International Ltd., combined with adequate
supply of cooking oils already in the domestic market, have made
importing vegetable oils unprofitable, Cao said. China’s imports
in the first four months plunged 24 percent from a year ago to
1.5 million tons, customs data show.  On the Dalian bourse, palm oil for January delivery fell
0.6 percent to 9,128 yuan ($1,404) a ton, while  soybean oil 
declined 0.3 percent to 10,124 yuan.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
