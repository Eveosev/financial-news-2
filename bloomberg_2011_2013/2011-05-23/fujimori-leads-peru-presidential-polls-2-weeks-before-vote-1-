Peruvian Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori
led her opponent Ollanta Humala in the latest  presidential
polls two weeks before a runoff vote.  Fujimori had 43 percent support in the poll compared with
41 percent a week earlier, according to Ipsos Apoyo, a Lima-
based research company. Ex-army officer Humala had 39 percent,
compared with 40 percent a week earlier. The survey, which was
published today by America Television, was taken May 14-20 and
had a margin of error 2.2 percentage points.  Peru ’s sol surged to its strongest level in three years
last week as investors bet Humala, a one-time ally of Venezuelan
President  Hugo Chavez  who pledges to revise the  country’s free
trade agreements, will lose the June 5 vote.  Fujimori, daughter of jailed former president  Alberto Fujimori , has said she will keep Peru’s economy open to foreign
investment.  In a separate poll issued today by Datum Internacional,
Fujimori had 45 percent support and Humala had 41 percent. Datum
contacted 5,004 people from May 16-18 and the poll had a margin
of error of 1.4 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
