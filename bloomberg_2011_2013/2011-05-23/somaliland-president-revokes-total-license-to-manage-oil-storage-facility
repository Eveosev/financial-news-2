(Corrects name of company in first, third paragraphs.)  Somaliland, a breakaway republic in
northern  Somalia , revoked Total Mer Rouge SA’s license to manage
an oil-storage facility at the port of Berbera after it failed
to import fuel into the country for the past two years.  The government of the semi-autonomous region will take over
management of the facility with immediate effect, President
Ahmed Mohamud said in a decree yesterday in the capital,
Hargeisa.  The edict was issued after Somaliland’s parliament refused
to ratify an agreement between Total Mer Rouge and the
government, according to the statement from Mohamud. The company
took over management of Berbera port’s oil-storage facilities in
January 2000,  Jamhuuriya , a Hargeisa-based media group, reported
in 2000.  Total SA (FP) , the Paris-based  oil company , sold Total Mer Rouge
last year, Total spokesman Michael Crochet-Vourey said by phone
today from Paris. He declined to comment further.  Total Mer Rouge is based in  Ethiopia , according to the
website of Mbendi Information Services. Two phone calls to a
number for the company listed by Mbendi didn’t connect.  Somaliland, a former British colony, declared independence
from Somalia in 1991 after the fall of dictator Mohammed Siad Barre. While no country has yet officially recognized its
independence it has remained largely free of the clan warfare,
kidnappings and assassinations that have plagued Somalia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
