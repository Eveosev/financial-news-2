European Central Bank Executive Board
member Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell said an “ambitious deadline”
is needed for the full adoption of  Europe ’s common electronic-
payments system.  “We must set a realistic and ambitious deadline,” Tumpel-
Gugerell said in a speech in  Frankfurt  today. Market
uncertainty, an economic slump in the 17-member euro region and
a lack of information about the Single European Payments Area,
or SEPA, delayed implementation, she said.  SEPA enables customers to make euro transfers across
borders within Europe using a single payment account and a
single set of payment instruments. Thirty-two European countries
are participating in SEPA with some 4,400 banks having joined
the credit-transfer system and more than 3,000 lenders having
signed up for the direct debit scheme.  “We have to ensure that Europe is keeping pace with
electronic trading,” said Tumpel-Gugerell, who will step down
from her position at the end of May. “There’s clearly a need
for efficient, cheap, secure and easily available online
payments.”  Tumpel-Gugerell also called on  Germany  to step up efforts
to implement SEPA. “It seems unfortunate to me that Germany
with respect to SEPA so far has taken an observant position,”
she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
