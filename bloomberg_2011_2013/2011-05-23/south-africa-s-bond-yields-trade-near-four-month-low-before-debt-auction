South African government borrowing
costs were within one basis point of a more-than four-month low
before tomorrow’s debt auction, after inflation quickened less
than economists’ expectations in April.  The Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  is offering 2.1 billion
rand ($300 million) of bonds maturing in 2017 and 2020 at its
weekly auction, it said on its Bloomberg page. The secondary
market yield on the 2017 bond rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 8.13 percent at 2:38 p.m. in Johannesburg,
one basis point higher than on May 20, when it reached the
lowest on a closing basis since Jan. 13 and 41 basis points
lower than at the previous auction on March 8.  Consumer inflation was 4.2 percent in April, less than the
4.4 percent median estimate by economists, according to figures
from the statistics office on May 17 and a Bloomberg survey.
Retail sales growth slowed for the third consecutive month, a
separate, May 17 report showed, fueling bets the central bank
will keep its benchmark rate on hold. Foreign investors have
been net buyers of 19.4 billion rand ($2.8 billion) of South
African bonds this year, according to data from JSE Ltd., which
manages the nation’s stock and bond exchanges.  “That inflation could surprise in its softness in the
second half of 2011 would” support bond prices, Tradition
Analytics researchers led by Johannesburg-based Quinten Bertenshaw wrote in a research note. “Inflows into bonds might
still be forthcoming for a while” as foreign investors “seek
yield and critically assess their alternatives.”  Inflation Expectations  Inflation will breach the upper range of the 3 percent to 6
percent target range in the fourth quarter, peaking at 6.3
percent in the first quarter of 2012, the central bank’s
Monetary Policy Committee said on May 12 after holding its
benchmark interest rate at 5.5 percent, a 30-year low. The MPC
will be “vigilant” in monitoring inflation, Governor Gill
Marcus said.  Foreign investors have bought a net 19.9 billion rand of
South African bonds this year, according to data from JSE Ltd.,
which runs the nation’s stock and bond exchanges.  The secondary market yield on the 2020 bonds rose 4 basis
points to 8.56 percent today, 14 basis points lower than at the
previous auction on March 22. The yield fell to 8.32 percent on
May 20, the lowest on a closing basis since Jan. 13.  Tomorrow’s bond auction starts at 11 a.m., and the results
will be announced at about 11:30 a.m., the Reserve Bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
