The size of  Afghanistan ’s security
forces has increased by more than 50 percent in the past 18
months to 290,000 soldiers and police, a NATO adviser said
today.  The Afghan National Army grew by 97,000 troops, to 164,000,
since the NATO training mission began in November 2009, said
Jack Kem, a civilian who serves as deputy to the training
commander. The Army will have 171,600 troops by about September,
he said.  The police force of 126,000, up from 95,000, will reach
134,000 later this year, he said.  The annualized attrition rate for the police dropped to 30
percent recently, from 70 percent early in the program, and is
trending to less than 20 percent counting all forces, he said.
He called that level “sustainable.”  “There’s been a dramatic increase in both the quantity and
the quality of the Afghan national security force,” Kem said.  The U.S. plans to begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan
in July. NATO has endorsed a goal of handing over security
control throughout Afghanistan to Afghan forces by the end of
2014.  Kem, briefing reporters at the Pentagon, said NATO has been
recruiting 8,000 Afghan soldiers and police each month.  “We’re busting at the seams as we’re building new
facilities to do the training,” he said.  A top incentive for Afghans to enlist has been the chance
to learn to read and write, Kem said. He said 86 percent of
recruits are illiterate. NATO has created literacy programs
throughout the country and more than 81,000 recruits have
enrolled.  Trainer Shortage  New recruits are subject to multiple screening methods to
prevent potential terrorists from infiltrating the ranks, he
said.  A Defense Department report last month found that growth of
the Afghan security forces has been hindered by a shortfall in
the number of coalition trainers.  Kem said NATO is short about 400 trainers in such
specialties as policing, aviation and explosive ordnance work.  He said he has seen no impact on Afghan security forces
from the death of  Osama bin Laden . NATO expects to meet its goal
to transition to all-Afghan-led security by Dec. 31, 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
