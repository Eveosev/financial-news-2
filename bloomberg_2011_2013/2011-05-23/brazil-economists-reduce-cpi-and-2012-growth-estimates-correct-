(Corrects headline and second paragraph to show inflation
slowing.)  Brazil  economists cut their forecast
for economic growth next year and raised estimates for inflation
as the government steps up efforts to cool off the economy,
according to a central bank survey.  Brazilian consumer prices will rise 5.11 percent over the
next 12 months, down from last week’s forecast of 5.22 percent,
according to the median forecast in a May 20  central bank survey 
of about 100 economists published today. Prices, as measured by
the IPCA index, will rise 5.1 percent, higher than the 5 percent
median forecast in the previous week’s survey.  Economists expect Brazil’s gross domestic product to rise
4.1 percent next year, lower than the 4.2 percent median
estimate of the previous survey.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration is relying on a
mix of higher  interest rates , spending cuts and measures to curb
credit growth to fight the fastest inflation in more than five
years. Consumer prices rose 6.51 percent in the year through
mid-May, matching the reading of the benchmark IPCA index in
April, which breached the upper limit of the government’s target
range for the first time since 2005.  The government targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or
minus two percentage points.  Economists held their 2011 growth forecast at 4 percent.
Consumer inflation this year will rise 6.27 percent, down from
the 6.31 percent forecast in the previous survey.  The central bank will increase its benchmark interest rate
50 basis points to 12.50 percent by the end of 2011, before
lowering it to 12.25 by year-end 2012, the survey found.  Brazil has “work ahead” to bring inflation back to the
mid-point of its target range next year, central bank President
Alexandre Tombini said May 19.  The central bank will adjust monetary policy for long
enough to slow inflation to 4.5 percent next year, Tombini said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
