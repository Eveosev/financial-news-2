Malawi’s economic growth will
probably accelerate to 7 percent this year as good crop harvests
boost  food production , President Bingu wa Mutharika said.  The southern African nation’s economy expanded 6.7 percent
in 2010, Mutharika said in a speech to parliament today in
Lilongwe, the capital. The inflation rate is expected to remain
below 10 percent even though international  oil prices  have led
to higher fuel costs, he said.  Growth in the country, which earns about 60 percent of its
foreign exchange from exports of burley tobacco, has averaged
about 7.6 percent since 2005. Inflation was 7.1 percent in
April, according to the national Statistics Agency. Malawi
traditionally relies on foreign aid for about 40 percent of its
annual budget.  The government planned to meet recurrent spending in the
fiscal year through June 2012 with its own resources, Mutharika
said. It was hoping donors would finance development projects,
he said.  The U.K. is reviewing its aid program to Malawi, its
Department for International Aid said May 20. Mutharika expelled
the British High Commissioner to Malawi last month because of a
leaked memo describing the African nation’s leader as combative
and autocratic.  The European Union’s envoy to Malawi, Alexander Baum, said
a group of donors which offers aid through the Common Approach
to Budgetary Support hasn’t committed to help finance the
2011-2012 budget, according to the Nation newspaper.  Malawi is in talks with the U.K. government about resolving
the diplomatic dispute, Mutharika said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
