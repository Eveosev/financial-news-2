Brian Madigan, the  Federal Reserve ’s
former top staff adviser on interest-rate policy, was hired by
Barclays Capital to provide counsel on economic research and
regulation.  Madigan, who ended a three-decade Fed career last year and
served from 2007 to 2010 as director of the monetary-affairs
division, will be senior policy adviser and based in New York,
Head of Research Larry Kantor said today in an internal memo
obtained by Bloomberg News. Erica Chase, a Barclays spokeswoman,
declined to comment.  The 57-year-old Madigan is a marquee name for a Barclays
Plc division where  Dean Maki , a former Fed researcher, is chief
U.S. economist and two other former researchers, Troy Davig and
Michael Gapen, were hired in the past year. Madigan and Federal
Reserve Bank of New York President William C. Dudley were the
main architects of many emergency-lending programs implemented
by the central bank in 2008.  Barclays is the U.K.’s third-largest bank by assets, and
 Barclays Capital  is the investment-banking division. At the Fed,
Madigan was succeeded in July, by William English, a former top
deputy, ahead of the decision to buy $600 billion of Treasuries
in a second round of asset purchases. Madigan retired from the
central bank on Sept. 1, said  David Skidmore , a Fed spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
