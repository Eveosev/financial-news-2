Tanzania will expel British charities
working in the country if the U.K. gives a 30 million pound ($48
million) payment by BAE Systems Plc to them rather than the
government, the  East African  said, citing Foreign Minister
Bernard Membe.  BAE agreed to pay the money in February following a bribery
investigation, the Nairobi-based East African newspaper said on
its website.  The British government has been “adamant” that the money
should be paid to British charities, the East African reported.
Those charities include Oxfam, Save the Children and Action Aid,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
