Italy  led a surge in the cost of
insuring European sovereign debt on concern the region’s fiscal
crisis is spreading after  Standard & Poor’s  said it may cut the
country’s A+ credit rating.  Credit-default swaps on Italy jumped 15.5 basis points to
175.5, the highest since March 11, and  Greece  soared 33 to a
record 1,377 basis points, according to CMA. That helped push
the Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of 15 governments up
12 basis points to 202, the highest since Jan. 12.  Italy’s bond yields rose to the highest in four months as
the Treasury’s pledge to “intensify” structural changes and
push ahead with measures to balance the budget by 2014 failed to
reassure investors in the euro region’s third-biggest economy.
S&P cited the country’s slowing economic growth and
“diminished” prospects for a reduction of sovereign debt,
which is twice the European Union limit at 120 percent of gross
domestic product.  “A country with government debt to GDP of around 120
percent can ill-afford the market to take fright and push yields
much higher,”  Jim Reid , head of fundamental strategy at
Deutsche Bank AG in London, wrote in a note to investors.
“Whether you think Italy is a relatively safe credit or not,
they really don’t have much margin for error if the market
disagrees.”  Greek Downgrade  Hours before the May 20 S&P warning about Italy,  Fitch
Ratings  cut Greece three grades and said it would consider an
extension of maturities as a default. Investors are concerned
that Italy’s economy is too big to save after rescues of Greece,
Ireland and  Portugal .  The extra yield that investors demand to hold Italian 10-
year bonds over German bunds rose 13 basis points to 185. Swaps
on Italy remain the lowest of the region’s peripheral nations.  Contracts on Ireland jumped 20 basis points to 661,
Portugal rose 21 to 661 and  Spain  climbed 15 to 277, CMA prices
show. An increase signals deterioration in perceptions of  credit
quality .  Swaps on  Belgium  rose 11.5 basis points to 161, according
to CMA. The country plans to raise 2.5 billion euros to 3.5
billion euros in an auction of bonds due September 2013, June
2017, September 2021 and March 2022.  “The European deleveraging process is an enormous task and
its implications for markets are far from over,” Anke Richter,
a strategist at Mizuho International Plc in London, wrote in a
note to investors.  Financial Index  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers increased 9 basis points to 154, the
highest since March 17, and the subordinated index was 10 higher
at 257.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 9 basis points to a
five-week high of 371, and the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings rose 3 to 102.75.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14 million) of debt from default for five years
is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face
value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
