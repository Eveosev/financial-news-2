Israeli property and construction
shares tumbled the most since January as Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz said the government is considering additional steps to
curb rising housing prices.  The  Tel Aviv  Estate 15 Index of shares in the industry with
the biggest market value lost 2.5 percent, the most since Jan.
30, at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv.  “We are working on more regulatory steps in the area of
taxes to halt the price dynamics,” Steinitz said at a meeting
of the parliamentary finance committee today.  Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  said on May 3 the
fast-paced increase in housing prices may develop into a bubble
that would affect the stability of the country’s lenders. The
central bank on April 27 issued a draft directive limiting
variable-rate mortgages to one-third the value of the total
loan, aiming to limit risks to borrowers and the banking system.  Shikun & Binui Ltd. (SKBN) , billionaire Shari Arison’s
construction company, slid 2.4 percent to 8.78 shekels, the
lowest level since Dec. 1.  Africa-Israel Investments Ltd. (AFIL) , the
holding company with interests in real-estate development and
construction, lost 4.3 percent, the biggest drop since March 2,
to 23.55 shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
