CVR Energy Inc. (CVI)  began the startup
process of a continuous catalytic reforming unit at its
Coffeyville, Kansas, refinery, following repairs after a flange
fire on May 10, according to Steven Eames, a company spokesman.  The continuous catalytic reforming unit produces gasoline
and hydrogen, Eames, a company spokesman based in  Sugar Land ,
Texas, said in an e-mail today.  The May 10 fire was not expected to reduce second-quarter
throughput at the plant, CVR Chief Executive John Lipinski said
on a conference call May 10.  The 115,700-barrel-a-day refinery processes crude oil from
CVRâ€™s owned and leased gathering system and via pipeline from
storage in Cushing, Oklahoma, the company said. CVR maintains
capacity on the Spearhead pipeline, which allows it to receive
crude oil from  Canada .  The refinery can process Canadian medium and heavy sour
crudes and sweet synthetics, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
