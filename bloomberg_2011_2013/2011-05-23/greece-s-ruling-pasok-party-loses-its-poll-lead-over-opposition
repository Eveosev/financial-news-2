Greece ’s ruling Pasok socialist party
has lost its lead over the main opposition party, amid
expectations that Greece’s situation will worsen, an opinion
poll by  MRB Hellas  for  Real News  indicated.  Both Pasok, led by Prime Minister  George Papandreou , and
the opposition New Democracy party were favored by 21.5 percent
of those questioned. In April, Pasok had a 1.8 percentage-point
advantage. Its lead has been declining since February 2010, when
it stood at 11.4 percentage points.  Almost 90 percent of people polled said Greece’s situation
will worsen and 80 percent said the rescue plan agreed with the
European Union and the  International Monetary Fund  is having a
negative effect. Eighty-three percent said the government’s
effectiveness is “probably” or “definitely” declining.  Greece has implemented measures including salary and
pension cuts and higher taxes, in exchange for the 110 billion-
euro ($154 billion) bailout by the EU and IMF last May.
Papandreou will hold a cabinet meeting today to discuss further
measures and asset sales.  Asked whether Papandreou or  New Democracy  leader Antonis Samaras is better suited to be premier, 26.5 percent chose
Papandrou and 26.3 percent Samaras; 45.2 percent said neither.
Pasok would win if elections were held now, according to 31.5
percent of respondents; 19 percent said New Democracy and 33.5
percent said no party would get a solid majority.  Eighty percent of those polled said they wouldn’t accept
more austerity measures, while 16.1 percent said they would.
Fifty-eight percent said a Greek default is likely, compared
with 37.6 percent who said it’s unlikely.  A total of 1,005 people were questioned on May 18. There
was a 2.5 percentage-point margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
