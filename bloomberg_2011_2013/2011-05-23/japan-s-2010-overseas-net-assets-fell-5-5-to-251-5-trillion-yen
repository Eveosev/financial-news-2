     May 24 (Bloomberg) -- Japan ’s net overseas assets dropped
for the first time in two years in 2010 as a strong yen cut the
value of those holdings.  The value of net assets declined 5.5 percent to 251.5
trillion yen ($3.1 trillion) at the end of last year, the
 Finance Ministry  said in Tokyo today. Japan will remain the
world’s largest net external asset holder for the 20th year
unless  China  increases its holdings more than 50 percent from
167.7 trillion yen, the ministry said.  The yen was 11.5 percent stronger against the dollar
compared with a year earlier, cutting net assets by 41.3
trillion yen、according to the Finance Ministry.  To contact the reporters on this story:
