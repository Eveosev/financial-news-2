Cotton in  Malawi  is selling at more
than double the government’s recommended minimum price of 75
kwacha ($0.50) a kilogram amid high international demand, the
Guardian said, citing Allan Tchalison, chairman of the Cotton
Growers’ Association.  The fiber is selling for as much as 190 kwacha a kilogram,
the Lilongwe-based newspaper said. Cotton production in Malawi
may climb to 58,000 metric tons this season from 29,000 tons a
year earlier, the Guardian said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
