Enbridge Energy Partners LP (EEP)  is
operating its Ozark crude oil pipeline at reduced rates after a
pump station lost power following Midwestern storms, Larry Springer, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail.  The Ozark line, part of Enbridge’s Mid-Continent System,
moves heavy and low-sulfur oils between Cushing, Oklahoma, and
Wood River,  Illinois .  Enbridge said last month that its Ozark pipeline would be
able to meet 12 percent of requests for transport during May.
Producers, traders and refiners were scheduled to move 226,350
barrels a day on the line this month, compared with nominations
to transport 1.93 million, the company said April 27.  Springer didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail asking how
much throughput on the line had been affected and when the pump
station was expected to return to service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
