Coal export prices at  Richards Bay ,
 South Africa , site of the continent’s biggest facility for
shipping the fuel, fell for a third consecutive week.  Prices dropped 1.2 percent to $118.29 a metric ton on
average last week, according to Petersfield, England-based
researcher IHS McCloskey. That’s the lowest since the week ended
Feb. 18. They’ve advanced 27 percent in the last 12 months.  Japan is the world’s biggest importer of coal used to
generate power, shipping in 113 million tons of the fuel
in 2009, according to the London-based World Coal Association.
The country’s coal demand will be below target at 110 million
tons this year as 8 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity
remains out of operation, Masato Uchimaya, director of energy
business at Electric Power Development Co., said today.  Capacity in  Japan  was reduced after the earthquake and
tsunami on March 11.  Transnet Ltd., which manages South Africa’s ports and rail
system, plans to boost capacity of its Richards Bay coal line to
80 million tons a year to increase shipments from the terminal.
While Richards Bay is capable of shipping 91 million tons
of coal a year, it exported 63.4 million tons in 2009, the
terminal’s Chief Executive Officer Raymond Chirwa said March 30.  Expansion Project  The expansion project, in the planning stage, will cost
about 5.1 billion rand ($758 million), Moira Moses, Transnet
group executive for capital projects, said in an interview on
May 6. Richards Bay Coal Terminal’s owners include  Exxaro
Resources Ltd. (EXX) , BHP Billiton Ltd., Anglo American Plc,  Xstrata
Plc (XTA) , Total SA and Sasol Ltd.  Power-station coal  prices  at Australia’s Newcastle port, an
Asian benchmark, rose 2.3 percent in the week to May 27. Prices
at the New South Wales port increased to $119.47 a ton,
according to the  globalCOAL NEWC Index .  European coal derivatives advanced. Coal for delivery to
Amsterdam, Rotterdam or Antwerp with settlement next year gained
$1.20, or 0.9 percent, to $129.95 a ton by 10:43 a.m. in  London .  Profit from running coal-fired  power plants  for next month,
the so-called clean-dark spread, is about 5.90 euros ($8.51) a
megawatt-hour, compared with 24 cents from burning natural gas,
Bloomberg data showed. The calculation uses electricity prices
in  Germany  and takes emission costs into account.  December carbon-dioxide permits under the European Union
cap-and-trade system rose 1.9 percent to 17.21 euros. Gas for
delivery in the six months through September 2012 to the U.K.,
Europe’s biggest consumer of the fuel, rose 1.1 percent to 65.85
pence ($1.09) a therm in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
