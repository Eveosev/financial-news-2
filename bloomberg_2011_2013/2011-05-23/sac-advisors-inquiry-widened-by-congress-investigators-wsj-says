U.S. Congress investigators plan to
widen a stock-trading inquiry into SAC Capital Advisors LP, a
hedge-fund firm, by looking at any suspicious trading in the
options market, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter.   Senate investigators are discussing the matter with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the  Justice Department  and
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the newspaper said,
adding that the three bodies declined to comment.  Senator  Charles Grassley , the senior Republican on the
Senate Judiciary Committee, is looking into about 20 instances
in the past decade when the regulatory authority suspected that
SAC might have bought or sold stocks on the basis of inside
information, the Journal said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
