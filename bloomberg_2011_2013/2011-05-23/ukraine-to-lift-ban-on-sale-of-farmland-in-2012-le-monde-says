Ukraine plans to lift a ban on the
sale of farmland next year, Le Monde reported, citing an
interview with Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk.  “We will, in the course of 2012, lift the moratorium on
the sale of agricultural land,” Prysyazhnyuk told Le Monde
during a visit to Paris, the newspaper said. The ban has been in
place since land privatization in 1996, Le Monde said.  Ukraine also wants a commodity-exchange listing for Black
Sea-export wheat in Kiev as soon as this year, and is in talks
with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the newspaper reported,
citing Prysyazhnyuk.  The agriculture minister opposes a government plan to tax
grain exports because it would disadvantage farmers, he said,
according to Le Monde.  To contact the reporter on this story:
