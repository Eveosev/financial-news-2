U.S. coal exports rose to a 20-year
high after floods in  Australia  disrupted supply of the variety
used to make steel, said Simpson, Spence & Young Ltd., the
world’s second-largest shipbroker.  Shipments climbed to an annual rate of 96 million metric
tons in the first quarter, Derek Langston, a London-based
director at the shipbroker’s research and consultancy unit, said
by phone today. That’s the most since the 99.3 million tons
reached in 1991, he said.  Queensland Resources Council, representing miners in the
Australian state, said in January 85 percent of mines were
“impaired by excess water.” Further rains delayed a production
recovery, RBS Morgans Ltd. said last month.  “There’s been price inflation in coking coal, and
therefore some of this mined coal from the U.S. has been more
profitable,” Langston said. “It’s attracted more U.S. coal
onto the international market.”  The increase in shipments was driven by coking coal used in
steel production, he said, adding that Queensland is the largest
exporter of that variety of the raw material.  Indonesia  is the
biggest shipper of power-station coal that’s burned to generate
electricity, according to the shipbroker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
