Swiss stocks retreated, dragging the
Swiss Market Index to a two-week low, as investors speculated
that  Europe  will fail to contain its sovereign-debt crisis.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA and  UBS AG (UBSN)  led declines on the
benchmark SMI, dropping 3.4 percent and 2.2 percent,
respectively. Holcim Ltd., the world’s second-largest cement
maker, retreated 3.2 percent.  The SMI sank 92.79, or 1.4 percent, to 6,437.82 at the 5:30
p.m. close in Zurich, the lowest level since April 19. The
decline pares this year’s gain to less than 0.1 percent. The
broader Swiss Performance Index dropped 1.5 percent today.  “Concerns amongst traders indicate that this could be the
start of a much awaited correction in the markets,” said Sandy Jadeja, the chief technical analyst at  City Index  in London.  Swiss stocks fell today after Standard & Poor’s cut Italy’s
credit-rating outlook to negative from stable after close of
trading on May 20, citing slowing economic growth and
“diminished” prospects for a reduction of government debt.
 Italy ’s Treasury said in a statement from  Rome  that it will
“intensify” structural changes in the economy and push ahead
with measures to balance the budget by 2014.  European services and manufacturing growth slowed more than
economists forecast in May, suggesting the region’s economy is
struggling to maintain momentum amid surging energy costs and
tougher government austerity measures.  Richemont, the world’s largest jewelry maker, lost 3.4
percent to 53.85 Swiss francs. Holcim slid 3.2 percent to 65.7
francs, the lowest in two months.  UBS, Switzerland’s biggest bank, declined 2.2 percent to
15.9 francs. Bank stocks accounted for the biggest declines on
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
