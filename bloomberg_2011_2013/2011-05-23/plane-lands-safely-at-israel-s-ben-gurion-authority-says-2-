An  El Al Israel Airlines (ELAL)  Ltd. plane
with technical problems landed safely at Ben Gurion
International Airport, the Israel Airport Authority said in a
statement read by phone.  The pilot discovered a malfunction in the landing gear
after taking off for Newark,  New Jersey , El Al said in an e-
mailed statement. The plane then circled the airport and dumped
fuel in the sea as it waited for daylight and to reach the
desired weight for landing.  Earlier this month, the airport delayed flights and
grounded planes amid concern that fuel supplies there were
tainted.  El Al fell 3.8 percent to 11.3 shekels at 1:45 p.m. in Tel
Aviv.  To contact the reporter on this story:
