El Sewedy Electric Co.,  Egypt ’s
biggest publicly traded maker of electrical cables, said first-
quarter profit fell 32 percent because of unrest in the North
African country.  Net income declined to 171 million Egyptian pounds ($29
million) from 251 million pounds a year earlier, the Cairo-based
company said in an e-mailed statement. Sales increased 21
percent to 3.55 billion pounds.  Shares of El Sewedy fell 1.9 percent to 37.81 pounds at
10:51 a.m. in Cairo, valuing the company at 6.49 billion pounds.  The turmoil that accompanied the ouster of President  Hosni
Mubarak  in February may slow Egypt’s economic growth to 1
percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund,
the lowest annual rate since 1992.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
