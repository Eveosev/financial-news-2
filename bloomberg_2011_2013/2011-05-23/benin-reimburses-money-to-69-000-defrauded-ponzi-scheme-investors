Benin  repaid 69,000 people who lost
money in an investment scheme that collapsed last year as
President Thomas Boni Yayi sought to fulfil a promise made
during a contentious election campaign.  The investors got 10.1 billion  CFA francs  ($21.5 million)
between September and this month, said Severine Lawson, a lawyer
and head of a committee set up to deal with issues arising from
the scheme, known as ICC Services.  Boni Yayi, who was elected to a second term in office March
13, pledged during the campaign and in a speech made when he
took the oath of office to see investors paid back. An estimated
150,000 depositors were defrauded of the equivalent of 5 percent
of the country’s gross domestic product, according to the
 International Monetary Fund .  The committee reached a deal with lawyers representing ICC
Services, which had an office in the commercial capital,
Cotonou, until the scheme collapsed in June 2010, to sell 70
buildings and 100 vehicles to pay back more investors, Lawson
said in a statement on state-owned Office de Radiodiffusion et
Television du Benin on May 21.  “They all will be reimbursed,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
