Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the largest U.S.
oil company, had an upset that caused flaring at the Joliet,
Illinois, refinery, according to a filing with state regulators.  The upset began May 21 before midnight local time and the
release of gases was ongoing, the company said in a  filing  with
the Illinois Emergency Management Agency.  Kevin Allexon, a Fairfax, Virginia-based spokesman for
Exxon, couldn’t immediately be reached by e-mail for comment.  Refinery outages can increase prices for refined products
as refiners turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil because less feedstock is needed.  The 248,000-barrel-a-day refinery processes primarily
Canadian crude and produces gasoline, diesel, liquefied
petroleum gas and asphalt among others, according to the  Exxon
Mobil .  The Joliet refinery is 42 miles (68 kilometers) southwest
of  Chicago  on the Des Plaines river.  To contact the reporter on this story:
