The zloty weakened for a third day
and Polish stocks fell to a two-month low as concern that the
European debt crisis is deepening hurt emerging-market assets.  The zloty declined 0.6 percent to 3.9452 per euro as of
9:56 a.m. in Warsaw. The benchmark WIG20 Index lost 1.4 percent
to 2,794.25, the lowest since March 25, led by  PKN Orlen  SA,
Poland’s biggest oil refiner, and copper producer  KGHM Polska
Miedz SA. (KGH)   Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero’s
Socialist party suffered its worst defeat in more than 30 years
in local elections amid a backlash over austerity measures.
 Fitch Ratings  cut Greece by three grades and  Standard & Poor’s 
said Italy was at risk of a downgrade.  “Risk has been hit by further negative developments in the
eurozone,” BNP Paribas SA’s emerging-market strategists wrote
in a note to customers. “News flow from the eurozone continues
to dominate trading.”  PKN Orlen retreated 1.8 percent to 50.55 zloty. Oil
declined in New York, with futures down as much as 2.5 percent,
after hedge funds cut bullish bets on oil to a three-month low
and U.S. gasoline prices at the pump fell.  KGHM declined 2 percent to 178 zloty, a one-week low.
Copper for three-month delivery dropped as much as 1.5 percent
to $8,935 a metric ton on the London Metal as data showed
manufacturing in  China  may expand at a slower pace this month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
