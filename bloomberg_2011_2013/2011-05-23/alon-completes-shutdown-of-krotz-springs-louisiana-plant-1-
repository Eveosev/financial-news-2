Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ)  completed the
shutdown of its refinery near Krotz Springs,  Louisiana , today
because of supply disruptions caused by rising water levels on
the Atchafalaya River.  Alon began work to close the refinery last week and plans
to reopen it next month, said Joseph Israel, a company
spokesman. The plant is in a zone that was ordered evacuated May
15 because flooding was expected. St. Landry Parish officials
had granted the refinery permission to remain open.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  shut a crude oil pipeline May 13 that
supplies the Krotz Springs plant, along with Exxonâ€™s Baton Rouge
plant, to reduce the risk of damage from flooding.  Alon built a levee to help protect the 83,000-barrel-a-day
plant. The company has said it will conduct maintenance that was
originally scheduled for the third quarter to minimize the
effect on annual crude runs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
