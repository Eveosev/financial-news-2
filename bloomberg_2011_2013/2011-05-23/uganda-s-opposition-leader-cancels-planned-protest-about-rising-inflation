 Ugandan opposition leader  Kizza
Besigye  cancelled a scheduled protest over accelerating
inflation today because he had “other engagements,” his aide,
Sam Mugumya, said.  Police surrounding Besigye’s home in Kasangati, 17
kilometers (10.6 milles) north of Kampala, the capital, didn’t
interfere when he left his house by car for an appointment in
the city, Mugumya said in a phone interview.  Besigye has been repeatedly arrested while leading twice-
weekly “walk-to-work” protests that began last month against
rising inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
