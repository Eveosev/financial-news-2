New York Mets owner  Fred Wilpon  said
the team overpaid for outfielder Carlos Beltran and called third
baseman  David Wright  “a very good player. Not a superstar,”
according to an article in the New Yorker magazine.  Wilpon also said that Mets shortstop Jose Reyes won’t
succeed in getting “Carl Crawford money” on the Major League
Baseball free-agent market, referring to the seven-year, $142
million contract the outfielder signed with the Boston Red Sox
this year.  The Mets paid Beltran $119 million over seven years in 2005
after he led the  Houston Astros  to a World Series berth. He’s
been plagued by injuries during his time in New York.  “We had some schmuck in New York who paid him based on
that one series,” Wilpon told the magazine in the  article ,
which appears in the May 30 issue. “He’s 65 to 70 percent of
what he was.”  The Mets are 22-24 and six games behind the division-
leading  Philadelphia Phillies  in the National League East. They
haven’t reached the  postseason  since 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
