Bacterial infections have caused at
least 70 people to become ill in northern  Germany ,  Bild Zeitung 
reported, citing health ministries in  Lower Saxony , Hamburg,
Bremen and Schleswig-Holstein.  The infections are caused by E. coli, bacteria usually
found in the lower intestine, which can lead to hemolytic-uremic
syndrome or HUS. HUS can damage the brain and kidneys, and is
fatal in 5 to 10 percent of cases, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
