Germany â€™s ruling coalition favors
pressing ahead with tackling the  budget deficit  as tax revenue
grows rather than cutting taxes, the  Bild Zeitung  reports,
citing party chiefs.  Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble , a  Christian Democrat ,
and Philipp Roesler, the new chairman of the Free Democrats,
agreed in talks this month not to lower taxes unless the pace of
economic growth is maintained, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
