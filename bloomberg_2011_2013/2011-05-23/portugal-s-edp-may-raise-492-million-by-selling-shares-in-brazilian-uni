EDP-Energias de Portugal SA, the
nation’s biggest power company, said it may raise 350 million
euros ($492 million) selling shares in its Brazilian unit.  The Lisbon-based company, which is selling as much as 14
percent of the business, expects to conduct the sale by the
beginning of July, EDP Chief Financial Officer Nuno Alves said
yesterday in an interview with Bloomberg Television.  The sale of shares in the unit comes after the Portuguese
utility in November cut its average annual investment target for
2011 and 2012 to 2.1 billion euros, from an earlier forecast of
2.4 billion euros a year. EDP is investing in new dams and wind
turbines in  Europe ,  Brazil  and the U.S. to rely less on oil and
coal while tapping government incentives for alternative energy.  “EDP will maintain control of the Brazilian business and
we continue to be fully committed to the growth of the business
in Brazil,” according to Alves.  The Portuguese company on May 5 said first-quarter profit
rose 11 percent on higher output from wind energy projects and
earnings from its Brazilian unit and regulated networks
business. The unit’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization jumped 20 percent in the first quarter.  Brazil grew 7.5 percent last year, the fastest increase
since the 1980s. The country’s economy will expand 4.5 percent
this year, according to estimates by the  Finance Ministry . EDP
hired Banco Santander Brasil SA as lead coordinator and Morgan
Stanley, Banco Itau BBA SA and BES Investimento do Brasil SA to
manage the share sale of its Brazilian unit.  Asset Sales  EDP on May 13 said it may sell in a public offering as much
as a 14 percent stake in the unit, EDP-Energias do Brasil SA.
EDP owns 64.8 percent of the unit. The company on March 3 also
said it aims to raise 500 million euros in asset sales this
year. EDP’s net debt decreased to 16 billion euros at the end of
March, from 16.35 billion euros in December.  “We hope to go over the 500 million euros in disposals we
talked about,” Alves said in the interview. EDP expects to sell
minority stakes in wind farms, he said.  EDP Renovaveis SA (EDPR) , the company’s renewable-energy division,
plans to install 0.8 gigawatts to 0.9 gigawatts of capacity a
year in 2011 and 2012.  EDP in 2010 forecast total installed capacity will increase
20 percent to 24.6 gigawatts in 2012, with wind projects and
hydropower plants accounting for 66 percent. A 1-megawatt plant
can supply about 1,000 average European homes. The company’s
installed capacity increased 7 percent to 22 gigawatts in 2010.  EDP fell 2 percent to 2.557 euros in Lisbon yesterday. The
stock has climbed 2.7 percent this year, giving the company a
market value of 9.35 billion euros. The Brazilian unit fell the
most in more than a year, dropping 5.8 percent on May 16, when
EDP announced plans to sell the stake.  European Bailout  Portugal , which will hold an early election on June 5, last
month became the third euro-area country after Greece and
Ireland to request a bailout. As part of that aid package, the
government will implement additional spending cuts and will sell
its stakes in companies including EDP and power grid operator
REN-Redes Energeticas Nacionais SA by year-end. The Portuguese
state owns 25 percent of EDP.  The majority of that holding can be sold this year, Alves
said. The new government will have to decide how it’s going to
carry out the sale of the rest of the state’s stake, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
