U.S. nuclear-power production fell
after  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  and  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  and shut reactors in
Illinois and New York.  Power generation nationwide decreased by 2,207 megawatts
from May 20 to 76,434 megawatts, or 75 percent of capacity,
according to a Nuclear Regulatory Commission report today and
data compiled by Bloomberg. Twenty-one of the nationâ€™s 104
reactors were offline.  Exelon shut its 1,136-megawatt Byron 2 reactor in Illinois
late May 21 to replace a pressure relief valve, the company said
in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The Byron 2 reactor is 85
miles (137 kilometers) west of Chicago.  Entergy shut its 1,020-megawatt Indian Point 2 reactor May
20 to replace three high-voltage bushings on a main electrical
transformer, according to an e-mail from the company last week.
The Indian Point 2 reactor is 27 miles (43 kilometers) north of
New York City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
