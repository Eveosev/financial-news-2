(Corrects location in first paragraph.)  Azerbaijan ’s plans to sell natural
gas to  Syria  may be affected by unrest in the Middle Eastern
country, APA news agency  reported  today, citing a senior Azeri
energy official.  “The implementation of these plans will depend on the
developments in that country,” said Elshad Nassirov, vice
president of State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, also known as Socar.  The construction of pipelines to carry Azeri gas to Syria
via Turkey is to be completed by the end of this year, Nassirov
said. Syria will buy 3.5 million cubic meters of gas a day from
Azerbaijan under an agreement signed in November. Supplies are
expected to start by the end of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
