GT Solar Inc., a maker of polysilicon
manufacturing equipment, climbed to an almost three-year high
after it reported higher-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings
and raised its revenue forecast.  GT Solar rose $1.54, or 13 percent, to $13.16 at 5:20 p.m.,
after the close of regular Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The
Merrimack, New Hampshire-based company hasn’t closed above $13
since August 2008. It closed today at $11.62.  GT Solar reported earnings of $51.9 million, or 41 cents a
share, in the quarter that ended April 2. That’s higher than the
35 cent-average estimate of eight analysts tracked by Bloomberg.  The company, which also makes manufacturing equipment for
synthetic sapphires, expects fiscal 2012 revenue to be between
$1 billion and $1.1 billion, compared with its earlier forecast
of between $850 million and $1 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
