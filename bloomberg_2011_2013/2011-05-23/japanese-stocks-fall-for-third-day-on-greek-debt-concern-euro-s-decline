Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average
declined the most in six weeks as makers of construction
equipment declined after Nomura Holdings Inc. said demand in
China will cool and  Fitch Ratings  cut Greece’s credit rating.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s second-largest maker of
construction machinery, retreated 5.9 percent after Nomura cut
its estimate for sales in China and a report showed
manufacturing growth in Japan’s No. 1 export market is slowing.
 Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets more than 30 percent of its
sales in Europe, lost 1 percent.  Tokyo  Electric Power Co.
slumped 9 percent after the utility reported the biggest loss
among the country’s nonfinancial companies.  The Nikkei 225 dropped 1.5 percent to 9,460.63 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, the most since April 12. The broader Topix index
declined 1.2 percent to 817.68, with more than three times as
many stocks falling as rising.  “There’s concern  China ’s economy will slow,” said
Yasuhiko Hirakawa, a  fund manager  at Tokyo-based DIAM, which
manages the equivalent of $55 billion. “Even if manufacturing
recovers, it’s doubtful that demand will also recover.”  The Topix has lost 12 percent since the magnitude-9
earthquake and tsunami on March 11 that devastated Japan’s
northeast coast, crippling four of Tokyo Electric’s nuclear
reactors and disrupting supply chains at companies from Toyota
Motor Corp. to chipmaker Renesas Electric Corp. Shares in the
gauge traded today at 0.93 times estimated book value, compared
with 2.12 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Machinery Makers Drop  Construction-machinery makers dropped after Nomura cut its
estimate for equipment sales in China by 20 percent for the year
ending March 2012, citing measures by authorities to rein in
inflation. In addition to raising  interest rates , The People’s
Bank of China has lifted reserve requirement ratios for major
banks eight times since mid-November to curb lending in an
economy where price gains exceed a government target of 4
percent.  Komatsu plunged 5.9 percent to 2,381 yen and was the most-
actively traded stock in Japan. Hitachi Construction Machinery
Co. declined 6 percent to 1,676 yen.  Kobe Steel Ltd. (5406)  dropped 3.8
percent to 176 yen.  Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. (7012)  lost 4.9
percent to 291 yen.  Nomura cut its share-price estimate on Komatsu by 11
percent and lowered its rating on companies including Hitachi
Construction, Kobe Steel, and Kawasaki Heavy.  China Manufacturing  “Price stability will continue to outweigh growth as
Beijing’s top priority in the coming months,” said  Qu Hongbin ,
a Hong Kong-based economist at HSBC Holdings Plc. “ Beijing’s
policy focus is still directed at taming inflation.”  Japanese shares extended early declines after a report
compiled by HSBC and Markit Economics showed a measure for
manufacturing in China fell to its lowest level in 10 months.
The preliminary purchasing managers’ index dropped to 51.1 in
May from a final reading of 51.8 in April. A reading above 50
still indicates expansion.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , an industrial-robot maker that gets about half
of its sales from China, lost 4.1 percent to 12,300 yen and was
the heaviest drag on the Nikkei.  Shares also dropped after Fitch on May 20 lowered Greece’s
long-term debt rating to B+, four notches below investment grade,
and said even a voluntary extension of Greek bond maturities
would be “a default event.” The rating service said Greece
could also face a further reduction in its creditworthiness.  Greek Debt  “Greece’s debt restructuring is ready to start at any
time,” said  Takero Inaizumi , head of equity research in Tokyo
at Mizuho Investors Securities Co. “There’s concern that will
affect exports negatively.”  Canon, the world’s biggest maker of cameras, fell 1 percent
to 3,660 yen. Honda Motor Co., an automaker that gets more than
80 percent of its sales outside  Japan , dropped 1.1 percent to
3,030 yen.  The yen appreciated to 115.08 against the euro, the
strongest level since May 16, compared with 117.13 at the close
of  stock trading  in Tokyo on May 20. A stronger yen reduces
income at Japanese companies when overseas revenue is converted
into their home currency.  Tokyo Electric plunged 9 percent to 334 yen, the most on
the Nikkei. The company reported a full-year net loss of 1.25
trillion yen ($15.3 billion) following the accident at its
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant.  The utility, Japan’s largest, booked a 1.1 trillion yen
charge for the nuclear crisis and plans to raise 600 billion by
selling assets.  Tokyo Electric  also said it will decommission
four reactors at its stricken plant, and suspended plans to
build two additional reactors.  To contact the reporters on this story:
