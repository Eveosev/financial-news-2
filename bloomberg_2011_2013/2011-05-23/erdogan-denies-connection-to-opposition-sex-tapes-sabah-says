Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  denied accusations that his party was behind the release
of sex tapes that have so far led to the resignations of 11
opposition politicians,  Sabah  newspaper reported.  “The AKP has nothing to do with these tapes,” Sabah
reported Erdogan telling a crowd in the northwestern city of
Bursa, where he was campaigning before general elections on June
12. Erdogan suggested that the tapes were the work of gangs
connected to the parties and trying to “redesign” them, Sabah
said.  The release or threatened release of sex tapes by a group
calling itself “Different Nationalists” has led to the
resignation of 10 politicians, including six on May 21, from
Devlet Bahceli’s Nationalist Action Party, the second-biggest
opposition group in parliament. The party has blamed Erdogan’s
Justice and Development Party or AKP for the tapes.  The leader of the main opposition  Republican People’s
Party ,  Kemal Kilicdaroglu , took over a year ago after his
predecessor  Deniz Baykal  resigned following the release of a sex
tape showing him with a female legislator in a hotel room.  To contact the reporter on this story:
