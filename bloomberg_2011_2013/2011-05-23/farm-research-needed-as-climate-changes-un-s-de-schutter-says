Agricultural research is needed to
adapt farming to climate change, said Olivier de Schutter, the
 United Nations ’ special adviser on the right to food. Following
are comments he made at a conference in Brussels today:  “It’s important to invest in research, the improvement of
plants is absolutely important given the challenges we are
facing, particularly the threat posed by climate change to our
agricultural production.  ‘‘We must invest massively in sustainable farming, to have
much more diverse farming systems. The link between the cost of
producing food and the price of fossil energy, we have to be
aware, is a very serious threat to sustainability.’’  Biofuels ‘‘exercise a considerable pressure on the water
and land in the countries in the south.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
