Sudan ’s trade surplus almost tripled
to $1.4 billion in the first quarter as oil and gold exports
rose and imports tumbled, Finance Minister Ali Mahmoud Abdel
Rasoul said.  The surplus widened from $473.9 million in the same period
last year, Abdel Rasoul told parliament in Omdurman, a suburb of
Khartoum, the capital, today.  Exports grew to $3.56 billion from $2.9 billion over the
same period, with oil shipments gaining to $3.1 billion from
$2.6 billion and gold sales increasing to $246.9 million from
$169.7 million. The country’s imports fell to $2.1 billion from
$2.4 billion.  Sudan will expand gold mining and oil exploration in the
north as the oil-rich south becomes independent, Sudanese
President Umar al-Bashir told parliament last month. The south
is scheduled to become a separate nation on July 9 after the
region voted to secede from Sudan in a January referendum.  At independence,  Southern Sudan  will assume control of
about three-quarters of the country’s current oil production of
490,000 barrels a day, pumped mainly by China National Petroleum
Corp., Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd and India’s Oil &
Natural Gas Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
