Bayer AG (BAYN)  would want to be in the
“driver’s seat” of any possible merger,  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, citing Chief Financial Officer Werner Baumann.  Baumann made the comment in response to concerns that Bayer
may lose its pharmaceutical unit in a merger, the newspaper said,
citing an analyst’s note on a recent investors’ meeting which
the executive attended. Chief Executive Officer Marijn Dekkers
earlier this month said the German maker of aspirin is open to a
“merger of equals” that would strengthen its health-care unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
