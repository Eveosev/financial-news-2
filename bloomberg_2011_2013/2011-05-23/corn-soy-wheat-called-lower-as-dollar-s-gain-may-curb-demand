What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures may open 2 cents to 6 cents a bushel lower on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that demand will slow
from importers as the dollar climbs, said  Don Roose , the
president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa.  -- Soybean futures may open 5 cents to 8 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago as overseas buyers may slow purchases after prices rose
last week and the dollar gained today, Roose said. Soybean-oil
futures are expected to open 0.15 cent to 0.2 cent a pound
lower, while soybean-meal futures may open down $1.50 to $2 per
2,000 pounds, he said.  -- Wheat futures are called to open 7 cents to 9 cents a bushel
lower on the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the
 Minneapolis Grain Exchange  on speculation that a jump in prices
last week may curb demand, Roose said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
