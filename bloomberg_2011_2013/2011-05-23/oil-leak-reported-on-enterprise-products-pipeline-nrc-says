An oil leak was reported on a crude
pipeline operated by Enterprise Products Partners LP, in a
 filing  with the National Response Center. The incident location
was given as Seminole,  Oklahoma .  “A seal failure on a pump resulted in a leak of oil,”
according to the filing. “It is unknown when the leak began.”  Bloomberg News couldn’t immediately verify whether the
information in the NRC filing was accurate. U.S. companies must
notify the response center if they release hazardous substances
in excess of reportable quantities, under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly
known as Superfund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
