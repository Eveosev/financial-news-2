Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  Chief
Executive Officer  Marc Bolland ’s compensation, which could be as
much as 15 million pounds this year ($24.3 million), may be
limited by tough conditions in U.K. retailing, the Financial
Times reported, without saying where it got the information.  Bolland’s remuneration, which includes long-term
incentives, cash, shares and share awards, and salary, will be
revealed when the group’s annual report is published in the next
few days, the FT said.  Bolland’s bonus could potentially be up to two and a half
times his 975,000-pound salary, which would bring him about 6
million pounds, the FT said. However, the total amount set aside
for staff bonuses -- 30 million pounds at the half-year stage --
indicates that bonuses are unlikely to reach the maximum level,
the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the situation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
