The Vietnamese dong strengthened for
a third day on speculation recent government measures to boost
confidence in the currency are working.  The government has cracked down on illegal trading of
foreign currency in the unofficial market and set a ceiling on
dollar-deposit rates. Interest for individual dollar deposits is
capped at 3 percent, effective from April 13, while holdings of
dong can attract returns of as much as 14 percent.  “Though it is too early for monetary easing, the silver
lining is that confidence in the dong has been restored in the
last few months,” Viet Capital Securities wrote in a market
commentary dated May 20.  The currency gained 0.1 percent to 20,710 per dollar as of
4:27 p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The central bank fixed the reference rate at 20,673
today, unchanged for a fourth day, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
that rate.  The yield on the benchmark five-year bonds was unchanged at
12.69 percent, according to a daily fixing price from banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
