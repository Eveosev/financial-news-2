Gold futures rose to the highest in
more than a week as the European sovereign-debt crisis spurred
demand for the precious metal as a haven.  Standard & Poor’s  last week cut Italy’s credit-rating
outlook to negative from stable, citing slowing economic growth
and “diminished” prospects for a reduction of government debt.
 Fitch Ratings  lowered Greece’s long-term debt ranking to four
notches below investment grade. Today, gold priced in euros
climbed to a record.  “We see gold as a currency more than we see it as a
commodity,” said Dennis Gartman, an economist and the editor of
the Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter.  Gold futures for June delivery rose $6.50, or 0.4 percent,
to settle at $1,515.40 an ounce at 1:39 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price reached $1,519, the highest for a most-
active contract since May 11. The metal has gained 29 percent in
the past year, reaching a record $1,577.40 on May 2.  The spot price of gold climbed to an all-time high of
1,080.95 euros an ounce today.  The  U.S. Treasury  has said Congress must raise the $14.3
trillion debt ceiling by Aug. 2 to avoid a government default on
loans.  Monetary policy  will “remain accommodative for at least
the next couple of months,” said Tom Pawlicki, an analyst at MF
Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago. “The inability of the dollar
to maintain its safe-haven status is potentially supportive for
metals.”  Silver futures for July delivery fell 18.3 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $34.904 an ounce on the Comex. The price has almost
doubled in the past 12 months.  Palladium futures for June delivery declined $3.70, or 0.5
percent, to $731.80 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Platinum futures for July delivery dropped $13.50, or 0.8
percent, to $1,755.90 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
