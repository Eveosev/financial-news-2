Serbia will ask  Russia  to lift
customs on cars made in the Balkan country where  Fiat SpA (F)  is
preparing production of two new models,  Vecernje Novosti 
newspaper reported, citing Deputy Economy Minister Jelena
Marjanovic.  Cars were not included in the 2009 free trade agreement
between Serbia and Russia, the newspaper said. After lifting
customs on Serbian furniture expected in June as part of gradual
removal of remaining barriers, Serbia will seek the same for
cars, Marjanovic told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
