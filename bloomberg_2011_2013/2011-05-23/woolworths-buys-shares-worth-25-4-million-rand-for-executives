Woolworths Holdings Ltd., a South
African food and clothing retailer, said it bought shares valued
at 25.4 million rand ($3.6 million) for four executives under a
long-term incentive plan.  “The company is obliged to purchase shares to settle the
value of the vested portion” after the executives fulfilled
conditions of a three-year performance agreement, Cape Town-
based Woolworths said today in a stock-exchange statement.  Simon Susman, who served for a decade as chief executive
officer before stepping down in November to become deputy
chairman, was granted stock worth 10.73 million rand, while
Finance Director Norman Thomson received shares valued at 3.15
million rand, the retailer said. Zyda Rylands, managing director
of the food unit, was awarded stock worth 9.35 million rand, and
Secretary Cherrie Lowe got shares worth 2.22 million rand.  Susman sold shares worth 4.31 million rand on the same day
they were acquired by the company, while Thomson sold stock for
1.26 million rand and Lowe disposed of shares valued at 893,431
rand, Woolworths said in a separate statement.  The retailer isn’t related to London-based Woolworths Group
Plc, which collapsed in 2008, or Woolworths Ltd. in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
