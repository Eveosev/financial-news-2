(Corrects to remove value in second paragraph of May 24
story.)  Lend Lease Group (LLC)  plans to sell its
half of the  King of Prussia shopping mall , the largest shopping
center on the U.S. East Coast, to a  Morgan Stanley (MS)  fund for
about $545 million.  Australia’s biggest construction company will sell its
interest in the mall to the Morgan Stanley Prime Property Fund,
the Sydney-based company said in a statement to the Australian
stock exchange. The company, which expects a profit of about
$100 million from the sale, said it will use the proceeds to
repay its debt sourced in the U.K., and to fund its U.S.
investment pipeline.  U.S. funds are snapping up malls from Australian sellers as
values pick up and signs of a retail recovery emerge. Blackstone
Group LP, the world’s largest private-equity firm, in March
agreed to pay about $9.4 billion to buy  Centro Properties
Group ’s U.S. shopping centers.  U.S. mall operators are benefiting from sales to foreign
tourists as the sagging dollar boosts their purchasing power.
The 3-million-square-foot King of Prussia mall is located off
Route 202 in Pennsylvania. It is home to more than 400 shops and
restaurants, among them seven department stores including Macy’s
Inc., Bloomingdale’s, Nordstrom and  Neiman Marcus .  Lend Lease , which had scrapped plans to sell its holding in
the mall in 2008, expects to close the transaction in August.
The shares added 0.8 percent to A$8.42 at the 4:10 p.m. close of
