French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said
creating jobs must be the priority for  Group of 20  nations while
at the same time they must ensure respect for labor rights.  Sarkozy, speaking today in Paris at a conference on the
social implications of economic development, said that countries
with strong welfare systems did better during the recession that
followed the 2008 financial turmoil.  “France refuses a competition that drags us to the
bottom,” Sarkozy said. “Why can’t we aim for the highest
standards? We don’t need to get into a sterile debate that
opposes economic growth and social protection.”  The conference, hosted by the French Labor Ministry, is one
of several in Paris this week ahead of the  Group of Eight summit 
of industrial nations on May 26 and 27 in Deauville,  France .  G-8
members  are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
Russia and the U.S.  “Social protection is an excellent stabilizer in hard
economic times,” Sarkozy said. “Countries with strong social
protection did a better job weathering the downturn.”  He said G-20 countries have to create 110 million jobs by
2015 to get back to pre-crisis employment levels. The G-20
comprises members of the G-8 as well as countries including
 China , India, Brazil and  South Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
