Zimbabwe ’s Movement for Democratic
Change will demand that the country’s police chief, Augustine Chihuri, and military commander Constantine Chiyengwa are fired
before elections take place in the southern African nation, the
 Daily News  said, citing documents in its possession.  Chihuri and Chiyengwa would undermine the credibility of
elections in Zimbabwe because both men are partisan in their
support of President  Robert Mugabe ’s Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front, the Harare-based Daily News said on its
website. Security-industry reform is being blocked by Mugabe,
despite being a key demand by the  MDC  is negotiations between
the two parties, the Daily News added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
