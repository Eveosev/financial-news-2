Venezuela  will ration power again
this year, planning steps similar to those taken in 2010 amid an
energy crisis, Electricity Minister Ali Rodriguez said.  “We’re going to reapply the measures we applied in Caracas
last year nationwide, which punishes the wasting of electricity
and encourages energy savings,” Rodriguez said in an interview
on state television today. Any rationing measures require
President  Hugo Chavez ’s approval, Rodriguez said.  Venezuela has struggled to boost energy-generating capacity
to keep pace with an estimated 6 percent increase in demand this
year. The consumption jump, if it persists, would require an
additional 2,000 megawatts of new capacity a year, which is
“unsustainable,” Rodriguez said.  In addition to measures to slow energy use in Caracas,
Chavez also implemented national electricity rations last year
as a drought almost shut the  power grid . Venezuela, which relies
on hydroelectric plants for more than two-thirds of its power,
is again facing outages even as recent rains cause mudslides and
damage homes and infrastructure.  The government expects electricity use to climb after the
economy grew 4.5 percent in the first quarter, Rodriguez said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
