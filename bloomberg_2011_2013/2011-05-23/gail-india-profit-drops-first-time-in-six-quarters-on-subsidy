GAIL India Ltd. (GAIL) , the country’s
biggest natural gas distributor, posted a drop in profit for the
first time in six quarters after the government asked the
company to bear a higher share of the fuel subsidy bill.  Net income in the three months ended March 31 fell 14
percent to 7.83 billion rupees ($173 million) from a year
earlier, the company said in a statement to the Bombay Stock
Exchange today. The average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was a profit of 9.09 billion rupees. Sales rose 36
percent to 88.9 billion rupees.  GAIL, Oil & Natural Gas Corp. and  Oil India Ltd. (OINL)  are
required by the government to share part of the revenue loss
incurred by state-run refiners, which sell fuels including
diesel and cooking gas below cost. The share of fuel subsidy
borne by the companies was increased to 38.8 percent in the year
ended March 31, Oil  India  director of finance T.K. Ananth Kumar
said May 20.  Profit was lower in the fourth quarter on account of the
company’s subsidy contribution for liquefied petroleum gas, GAIL
said in a statement. The subsidy provision more than doubled to
9.02 billion rupees from 3.38 billion rupees a year earlier.  GAIL, ONGC and Oil India have been ordered to pay 302.9
billion rupees of the total fuel subsidy burden of 780 billion
rupees for the year ended March 31, ONGC Chairman A.K. Hazarika
said May 20.  GAIL rose 2.1 percent to 435.25 rupees at the close in
Mumbai, the biggest gain since April 13. The stock has dropped
15 percent this year compared with a 12 percent decline in the
benchmark Sensitive Index.  The company plans to spend 76.9 billion rupees in the
current financial year and borrow 32.3 billion rupees, GAIL said
in an earnings presentation in  New Delhi  today.  GAIL India has 7,847 kilometers (4,877 miles) of pipelines
carrying natural gas in the country, according to its  website .
The company plans to spend 200 billion rupees in the next four
years to build gas pipelines in India, Finance Director P.K.
Jain said March 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
