Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK)  gave a
big retirement fund, the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement
Association, unfavorable rates in foreign-exchange trading, the
Wall Street Journal reported, citing its own analysis of more
than 9,400 trades during the past decade.  The bank priced 58 percent of the transactions within the
10 percent of each dayâ€™s trading range that was least favorable
to the fund, the newspaper said.  A BNY Mellon spokesman confirmed the accuracy of the
figures, saying there was nothing improper in the practice, the
Journal said.  The pension fund said in a letter to BNY Mellon in January
that the bank, as its fiduciary, should have looked after its
interests by offering it the bext possible prices, the newspaper
said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
