Sappi Ltd. (SAP) , the world’s largest maker
of glossy paper, said it has started talks with staff and labor
unions about closing its Adamas Mill at  Port Elizabeth  in  South
Africa  because of falling demand and rising costs.  “The mill’s size, technical age and high costs of energy
and fiber have made it necessary to initiate a review,” Alex Thiel, Sappi’s chief executive officer for Southern Africa, said
in a statement today. A decision on the 40,000 ton-a-year mill,
which employs 213 people, will be made once the consultation is
completed toward the end of July, Sappi said.  Mondi Ltd. (MND) , Stora Enso Oyj and UPM Kymmene Oyj are among
papermakers to have closed mills as weaker sales lead to a glut.
The higher raw-material and power costs combined with
“difficult market conditions” have put additional pressure on
the Adamas plant, Johannesburg-based Sappi said.  The shares fell 1 percent to 35.65 rand by the 5 p.m. close
of trading in Johannesburg, curbing Sappi’s gain in the last 12
months to 28 percent and giving the company a value of 19.3
billion rand ($2.7 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
