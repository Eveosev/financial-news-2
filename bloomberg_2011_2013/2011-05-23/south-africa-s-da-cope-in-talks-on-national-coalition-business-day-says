South Africa ’s main opposition party,
the Democratic Alliance, may form a national coalition with the
Congress of the People to strip the ruling  African National
Congress  of more municipalities following May 18 local
government elections, Business Day said.  COPE will discuss an agreement with the DA at a working
committee meeting today, the Johannesburg-based newspaper cited
COPE spokesman Phillip Dexter as saying.  A coalition could sway
power away from the ANC in 11 municipalities, Business Day cited
DA Federal Executive Chairman James Selfe as saying.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
