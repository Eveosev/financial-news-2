Japanese and Australian  stock futures 
fell as commodity prices declined and after reports signaled
economic growth is slowing in the U.S. and Europe.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , a Japanese
camera maker that gets more than 80 percent of its sales abroad,
dropped 0.2 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those
of  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s largest exporter of consumer electronics,
declined 1.3 percent after the company unexpectedly reported a
third straight annual loss. ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the
world’s biggest mining company and Australia’s No. 1 oil
producer, lost 0.5 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,410 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 9,460
in Osaka,  Japan . They were bid in the pre-market at 9,410 in
Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index dropped 0.6 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
rose 0.4 percent in Wellington.  “Recovery in the U.S. economy is coming to a halt,” said
 Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend
Securities Co. “Momentum lacks strength in Europe, and in China
and there’s a sense of caution against the global economy.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.1 percent
today. In  New York , the index retreated 1.2 percent yesterday,
the most since March 16, to 1,317.37 as commodities slumped amid
concern Europe’s debt crisis is worsening and the global
economic recovery is losing momentum.  U.S. Indicators  The Federal Reserve Bank of  Chicago ’s gauge of economic
activity unexpectedly dropped below zero in April. The national
index, which draws on 85 economic indicators, was minus 0.45 in
April versus 0.32 in March. A reading below zero indicates
below-trend-growth in the national economy.  In Europe, services and manufacturing growth slowed more
than economists forecast in May. A composite index based on a
survey of euro-area purchasing managers in both industries fell
to a seven-month low of 55.4 from 57.8 in April, London-based
Markit Economics said yesterday. That’s the largest drop since
November 2008 and less than the median forecast of 17 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg for a reading of 57.3. A reading above 50
indicates expansion.  Belgium had the outlook on its AA+ credit rating lowered to
negative from stable at  Fitch Ratings , which cited concern over
the pace of structural reform.  Crude Oil  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 4.4 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a gain of 4.8 percent by the
S&P 500 and a drop of 0.4 percent by the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.2 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.3 times for the S&P 500
and 11 times for the Stoxx 600.  Crude oil for July delivery tumbled 2.4 percent to settle
at $97.70 a barrel in New York yesterday, the biggest one-day
drop since May 11. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for
six industrial metals including copper and aluminum lost 2.7
percent yesterday, the most since May 5.  Sony had a net loss of 260 billion yen ($3.2 billion) in
the year ended March 31, including a 360 billion yen charge for
deferred tax assets, the Tokyo-based company said in a
preliminary earnings statement yesterday. That compared with the
average estimate of 10 analyst surveyed by Bloomberg for a 76
billion yen profit and Sony’s previous forecast for annual
profit of 70 billion yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
