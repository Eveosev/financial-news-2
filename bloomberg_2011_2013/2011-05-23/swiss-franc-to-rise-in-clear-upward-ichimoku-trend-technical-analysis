The  Swiss franc  may climb to a record
against the dollar as charts point to a “clear” upward trend
for the European currency, Mizuho Securities Co. said, citing
trading patterns.  The franc has risen along the trend line plotting lows on
Feb. 11, April 1 and May 16, climbing to a record 85.54 centimes
per dollar on May 4. It has been above the so-called cloud of
its ichimoku chart since Feb. 17, supporting the upward move,
said Kengo Suzuki, a currency analyst at Mizuho Securities.  “The trend is very clear,” said Suzuki, whose Tokyo-based
company is a unit of  Japan ’s third-biggest bank by market value.
“The next target for the Swiss franc is a record high and
beyond, say 85 or 80.”  The Swiss franc traded at 88.36 centimes per dollar as of
7:18 a.m. in  Tokyo  from 88.38 centimes in  New York  yesterday.  Ichimoku charts are used to predict a currency’s direction
by analyzing the midpoints of historical highs and lows. The
conversion line plots the sum of the highest high and lowest low
in the preceding nine trading days. The cloud refers to the area
between the first and second leading-span lines on the chart and
is used to show an area where buy orders may be clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
