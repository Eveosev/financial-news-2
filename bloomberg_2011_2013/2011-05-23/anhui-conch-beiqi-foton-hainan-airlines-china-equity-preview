Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in China trading. Stock symbols are in parentheses
and prices are as of the 3 p.m. close.  The  Shanghai  Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, fell 83.89 points, or 2.9 percent to
2,774.57. Declines today wiped out the measure’s gains for the
year. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  declined 3.2 percent to 3,022.98.  Automakers: SAIC Motor Corp. (600104 CH), the nation’s
largest carmaker by market value, slid 3.3 percent to 16.01
yuan, the lowest level since Jan. 24. FAW Car Co. (000800 CH)
slipped 5.8 percent to 13.61 yuan.  Central agencies of the government and the Communist Party
will be allowed one vehicle for every 20 employees as public
agencies seek to reduce spending, the 21st Century Business
Herald reported today, citing an official statement that hasn’t
been released to the public.  Banks:  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd. (601398
CH), the world’s largest bank by market value, fell 1.8 percent
to 4.46 yuan, the lowest since March 25.  Agricultural Bank of
China Ltd. (601288)  (601288 CH) dropped 2.1 percent to 2.87 yuan.  China’s banking system requires further strengthening of
its risk management, Fan Wenzhong, director-general of the China
Banking Regulatory Commission, said at a forum in Shanghai on
May 21. Even though local lenders are significantly better
positioned than their global peers in terms of capital adequacy
ratios and liquidity, more risk management is “prudent,” Fan
said.  Huadian Power International Corp. (600027 CH) sank 4.1
percent to 3.76 yuan, the lowest close since April 7. The
company’s board approved a plan to raise as much as 2.1 billion
yuan ($323 million) selling new domestic shares to investors,
Huadian said May 20. It will sell as many as 600 million A
shares for at least 3.69 yuan each.  PetroChina Co. (601857 CH), the nation’s second-largest oil
refiner, retreated 1.9 percent to 10.87 yuan, the lowest close
since Nov. 23. The company shut its Dalian refinery for
maintenance until the end of June, parent  China  National
Petroleum Corp. said in its online newsletter today. Eight
refinery units were closed on May 20, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
