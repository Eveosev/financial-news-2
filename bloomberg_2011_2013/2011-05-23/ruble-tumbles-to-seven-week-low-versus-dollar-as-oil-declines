The ruble tumbled to its lowest level
in more than seven weeks against the dollar as crude oil fell
amid signs of slowing economy in the U.S. and concern  Europe ’s
debt crisis is escalating.  The Russian currency depreciated 1.2 percent to 28.37 per
dollar by 11:10 a.m. in Moscow trading, heading for its weakest
close since April 1. Against the euro, the ruble added 0.2
percent to 39.8400, a weekly high.  Crude oil,  Russia ’s chief export, fell as much as 1.5
percent to $98.61 a barrel. Greek Prime Minister  George
Papandreou  is scheduled to brief his Cabinet today on budget
cuts. U.S. consumer spending probably cooled in April amid
higher fuel prices, a Bloomberg News survey showed before a May
27 report.  Moves against the dollar and the euro left the ruble little
changed at 33.5315, the weakest level since April 26, versus the
central bank’s target currency basket, which it uses to manage
swings that hurt Russian exporters. The basket is calculated by
multiplying the dollar’s rate to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to
ruble rate by 0.45, then adding them together.  To contact the reporters on this story:
