The following companies had unusual
price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and share prices are as of 5:06 p.m. New York time.  The Merval Index fell 1.8 percent to 3,323.07.  Argentine stocks declined as U.S. economic data showed
signs of slower growth and  Europe ’s debt crisis lowered demand
for riskier emerging-market assets.  Molinos Rio de la Plata (MOLI)  SA, the Argentine food
company and soy processor, declined 2.5 percent to 30.70 pesos,
on indications of weaker global demand. Markets outside of
 Argentina  accounted for 67 percent of Molinos’s 2010 revenue.  Tenaris SA (TEN)  , the world’s largest maker of seamless
pipes, retreated 1.4 percent to 103 pesos as U.S. economic data
pointed to lower-than-forecast growth. North and  South America 
represent about 70 percent of Tenaris’s revenue.  YPF SA (YPFD)   dropped 1.1 percent to 192.90 pesos as
crude oil fell on concern Europe’s sovereign debt crisis will
slow economic growth and reduce fuel demand. Crude oil for July
delivery tumbled $2.64, or 2.6 percent, to $97.46 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
