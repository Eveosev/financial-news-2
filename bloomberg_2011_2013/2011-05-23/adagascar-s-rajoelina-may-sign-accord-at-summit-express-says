Madagascar’s President Andry Rajoelina will attend the next meeting of the  Southern African
Development Community  if they are willing to sign an accord that
recognizes him as head of a transitional government, the Express
reported.  All the parties involved in Madagascar’s mediation process
are invited to meet in Gabarone, Botswana next month, the
Antananarivo-based newspaper said. Rajoelina won’t go if it is
just another round of negotiations, said his head of
communications, Harry Rahajason, according to the newspaper.  There can be no more amendments to the “roadmap” drawn up
by SADC to resolve Madagascar’s two-year political crisis, the
Express cited Rajoelina as saying. The agreement recognizes
Rajoelina as the president until elections are held at some
future date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
