Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the largest
U.S. lender by assets, won preliminary court approval for a
$410 million settlement with consumers who claimed the bank
illegally charged excessive overdraft fees.  U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King in Miami today
tentatively approved the accord between about 1 million account
holders and the bank, according to minutes from a hearing posted
on the court’s website. A final approval hearing is set for
November. The judge will award plaintiff attorneys’ fees from
the $410 million fund, said one of the lead lawyers for the
consumers, Jeremy Alters.  Anne Pace, a spokeswoman for  Charlotte , North Carolina-
based Bank of America, said the bank already has made changes to
its overdraft policies, including the elimination of overdraft
fees for debit card transactions and reduced fees for customers
who overdraw their accounts.  “We’re pleased to reach a fair resolution to this
matter,’’ she said.  Institutions including Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase &
Co. and  Wells Fargo & Co . were named in related lawsuits.
Today’s settlement is only with Bank of America. Bank of America
didn’t admit any liability in the cases, Alters said.  The case is In Re Checking Account Overdraft Litigation,
09-02036, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  Florida 
(Miami).  To contact the reporter on this story:
