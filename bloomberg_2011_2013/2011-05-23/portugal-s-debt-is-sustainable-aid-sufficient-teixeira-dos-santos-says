Portugal ’s debt is “sustainable”
and a 78 billion-euro ($109 billion) aid package is sufficient
to allow the government to reduce its outstanding borrowing,
Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos said.  “Portugal’s public debt is sustainable,” Teixeira dos
Santos told reporters today in New York. “The weight of public
debt on our gross domestic product will start declining from
2013.”  The three-year aid plan for Portugal set goals for a budget
deficit of 5.9 percent of GDP this year, 4.5 percent in 2012 and
3 percent in 2013. Portugal’s public debt swelled to 93 percent
of GDP in 2010 from 68 percent in 2007. The European Commission
forecasts Portugal’s debt will increase to 101.7 percent this
year and 107.4 percent in 2012.  Teixeira dos Santos said May 5 the economy will shrink 2
percent this year, twice as much as he previously forecast, as
the government implements additional austerity measures to
qualify for the European Union and International Monetary Fund
aid package.  To contact the reporters on this story:
