The strength of the euro compared
with the dollar is reaching a critical level for  Europe ’s
exporters, European Union Trade Commissioner Karel  De Gucht  said
in a  Handelsblatt  interview.  The current exchange rate of the euro and dollar does not
reflect the strength of the U.S. economy and “can become a
burden that is not in Europe’s interest,” De Gucht was cited as
saying by the German newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
