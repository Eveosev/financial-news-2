Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in Taiwan trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 1:30 p.m. close. The Taiex
Index fell 89.52, or 1 percent, to 8,747.51, the lowest level
since April 19.  Delta Electronics Inc. (2308)  (2308 TT): The maker of notebook
computer power-supply pack shares slumped 6.1 percent to
NT$108.50, the lowest level since July 23. The company’s share-
price estimate was cut to NT$110 from NT$112 at JPMorgan Chase &
Co. The brokerage maintained the shock’s rating at “neutral”
and said it’s avoiding the stock within its technology
portfolio.  E-Ton Solar Tech Co. (3452 TT) sank 6.9 percent to a record
low of NT$26.30. The maker of solar cells plans to reduce the
number of its employees by a third as factory output dropped to
between 60 percent and 70 percent of capacity, the Apple Daily
News reported, without saying where it got the information.  E-Ton Solar declined to confirm the news, saying the
company “is making adjustments on its human resources because
of a slowdown,” the Taipei-based newspaper cited Lo Lai-Huang,
a company spokesman, as saying. Lo wasn’t immediately available
for comment at his office.  Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (2317 TT) dropped 2.9
percent to NT$100, the lowest since July 2. Three people were
killed and 15 injured in a blast at Foxconn Technology Group’s
Chengdu plant in southwest  China ’s Sichuan province. Hon Hai is
the flagship company of Foxconn Technology Group and the maker
of Apple Inc.’s iPhones and iPads.  Nanya Technology Corp. (2408)  (2408 TT), a memory chipmaker, lost
6.9 percent to NT$11.55 on speculation the exchange may restrict
trading because of a decline in the company’s book value per
share, according to Daniel Lu, an analyst at Mega Securities Co.  The exchange may declare Nanya to be a “full-delivery”
stock, barring trading of the shares using brokerage loans or
short-selling, Lu said. Under exchange rules, a company may be
classified as a “full-delivery” stock if its book-value per
share falls below NT$10 for two consecutive quarters.  Nan Ya’s book-value-per-share was NT$5.85 in the first
quarter and NT$8.11 in the fourth quarter of last year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Michael Lin, a spokesman for  Taiwan
Stock Exchange , is overseas and couldn’t comment on the
speculation immediately, according to his secretary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
