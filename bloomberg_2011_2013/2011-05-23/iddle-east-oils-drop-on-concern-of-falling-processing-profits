Mideast crude oils fell amid signs of
weakening processing profits, causing refiners to balk at paying
near-record premiums.  Murban crude for July loading slumped 33 cents to a premium
of 48 cents a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The grade reached 81 cents on May 16, 5 cents short of the
premium for June cargoes of 86 cents, the most in three years.
Qatar Land dropped 33 cents to a premium of 35 cents a barrel
over its benchmark, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Premiums for Middle East oil had been bid up as refiners
were hoping to profit from gains in processing margins. Those
levels have started to decline.  Gasoilâ€™s premium to Dubai crude, a measure of refinery
profits, was at $17.46 a barrel today, down from $21.22 a month
ago, according to data from brokers PVM Oil Associates Ltd.  Oman oil for immediate loading dropped $2.57, or 2.4
percent, to $104.45 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai for
loading in July fell 2.4 percent to $103.90 and Murban crude
decreased 2.6 percent to $109.07 a barrel.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for July narrowed 25
cents to $5.60 a barrel, data from brokers PVM Oil Associates
Ltd. showed. The exchange for swaps for August decreased to
$5.52 a barrel.  Oman futures for July delivery fell $2.85 to $104.85 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:37 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,109 contracts traded. The settlement price was at
$104.83 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
