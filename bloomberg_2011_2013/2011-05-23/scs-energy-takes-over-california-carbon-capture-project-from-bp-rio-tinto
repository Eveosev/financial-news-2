SCS Energy LLC, a closely held power
plant developer, will take over a proposed carbon-capture and
storage project in  California  from BP Plc and  Rio Tinto Plc. (RIO)   The Hydrogen Energy California project will convert coal
and petroleum coke into hydrogen and capture as much as 90
percent of its carbon dioxide emissions, according to a
statement posted today on its website. The hydrogen will fuel
turbine generators, and the captured emissions will be piped
into a nearby oil field to boost production.  BP and Rio Tinto, the original partners, invested $55
million each in the project. The U.S. Energy Department has
already invested $54 million and has authorized as much as $354
million more under a Clean Coal Power Initiative award.  To contact the reporter on this story:
