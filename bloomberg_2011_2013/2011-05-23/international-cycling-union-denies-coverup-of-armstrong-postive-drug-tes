The International Cycling Union
denied allegations made by former U.S. Postal Service team rider
Tyler Hamilton that record seven-time Tour de France winner
 Lance Armstrong  had covered up a positive doping test.  The governing body, known as UCI, said it has “never
altered or hidden the results of a positive test” in a
statement released today.  Hamilton’s allegations were shown last night on  CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s
 “60 Minutes”  program. The former Olympic champion alleged that
Armstrong got preferential treatment from UCI officials after
failing a test for a performance-enhancing drug in 2001.
Hamilton, 40, said he saw Armstrong doping on numerous occasions
and that the rider and leaders of the U.S. Postal Service
cycling team encouraged the use of performance-enhancing
substances.  “The allegations of Mr. Tyler Hamilton are completely
unfounded,” UCI said in its statement. “The UCI can only
express its indignation at this latest attempt to damage the
image of cycling by a cyclist who has not hesitated to abuse the
trust of all followers of cycling on several occasions in the
past. At no time did he see fit to inform the UCI of the events
he claims to have witnessed ten years ago, and which he is now
using in his attempt to harm the UCI.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
