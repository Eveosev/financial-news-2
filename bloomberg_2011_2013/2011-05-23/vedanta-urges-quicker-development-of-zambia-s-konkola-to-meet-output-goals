Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) , billionaire
 Anil Agarwal ’s copper producer, said its Konkola Copper Mines
unit in Zambia must speed up a deep-mining venture to reach
output targets.  The project must be “accelerated,” Chief Executive Officer
Mahendra Singh Mehta said in a company newsletter, without
specifying a timeframe. Konkola said in November it’s targeting
400,000 metric tons of copper cathode a year by March 2014.
Vedanta’s Zambian output was 217,000 tons last fiscal year.  Vedanta needs funds to hasten  Konkola ’s development as
Asian demand for the metal buoys prices. Konkola plans to sell
shares in an initial public offering this year, Agarwal said on
May 5. The IPO may take place as soon as next month, the London-
based Sunday Times reported yesterday.  Copper futures last week had their biggest weekly gain in
more than a month as global stockpiles shrank 2.8 percent to a
three-month low. Prices have jumped 40 percent in the past year,
driven by demand in  China , the largest consumer of the metal.  The Zambian deep-mining project may boost annual production
of copper ore at the Konkola mine to 7.5 million tons from 2
million tons by sinking a new shaft to depths of about 1,500
meters (4,900 feet), according to Konkola’s website. Zambia is
 Africa ’s largest copper producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
