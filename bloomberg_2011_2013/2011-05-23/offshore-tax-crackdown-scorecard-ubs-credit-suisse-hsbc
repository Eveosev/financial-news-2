The U.S. extended its crackdown on
offshore tax evasion last week, charging Michael F. Schiavo, a
managing director at SCG Consulting Group in Boston, with
failing to report his offshore account at  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  to
U.S. authorities.  Schiavo didn’t file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial
Accounts form, or FBAR, for an account at HSBC Bank Bermuda,
prosecutors said. Schiavo agreed to plead guilty in federal
court in Boston. Schiavo’s firm serves the venture capital and
private-equity industries. He also is a director at Boston
Private Bank and Trust Co., a Boston-based commercial bank.  The crackdown has led to criminal charges against UBS, the
largest Swiss bank, at least two dozen former UBS clients, four
former UBS bankers, and five bankers at  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
Switzerland’s second-largest bank. Three former clients of HSBC
Plc,  Europe ’s biggest bank, have been charged.  Below is a summary of the charges filed in federal courts
around the U.S.:  UBS: The Zurich-based bank agreed in February 2009 to pay $780
million to defer prosecution for aiding tax evasion by U.S.
clients. The bank said its Swiss private bankers helped wealthy
Americans evade U.S. taxes from 2000 to 2007. UBS also set up
sham offshore companies in  tax havens  such as the British Virgin
Islands, Hong Kong and Panama. UBS said it created misleading
forms saying those sham companies, not taxpayers, were the
beneficial owners.  Credit Suisse: Four Credit Suisse bankers were indicted in
February on a charge of conspiring to help U.S. clients evade
taxes through secret bank accounts. Managers in the cross-border
business “knew and should have known they were aiding and
abetting U.S. customers in evading their U.S. income taxes,”
according to the indictment in federal court in Alexandria,
Virginia. In the fall of 2008, the bank had “thousands” of
accounts with $3 billion in assets not declared to the IRS,
according to the indictment. Credit Suisse said it is
cooperating in the U.S. investigation of the bankers.  HSBC: The bank was the subject of an IRS summons in April
seeking information about Americans who had accounts at HSBC
 India  from 2002 to 2010. Through September 2010, about 9,000
U.S. residents had non-resident Indian accounts of $100,000 or
more, and only 1,391 disclosed their accounts to the U.S. in
2009, the IRS said in court filings in  California . The clients
had deposits of almost $400 million in the accounts. HSBC said
it doesn’t condone  tax evasion  and is cooperating with the U.S.  Bradley Birkenfeld: A former UBS banker, he pleaded guilty to
helping wealthy Americans, including billionaire Igor Olenicoff,
evade taxes. In 2007, Birkenfeld approached the  Justice
Department  and revealed what a prosecutor later described as a
“massive tax scheme” at UBS. He also detailed the scheme to
investigators from the U.S. Senate, the IRS and the Securities
and Exchange Commission. He was later indicted and pleaded
guilty in Fort Lauderdale,  Florida , to his role in the UBS
conspiracy. In August 2009, he was sentenced to 40 months in
prison, 10 months more than prosecutors sought. He asked
President Obama to reduce his sentence, saying he was treated
unfairly as a whistle-blower.  Igor Olenicoff: A billionaire real-estate developer, Olenicoff
pleaded guilty in December 2007 in Santa Ana, California, to
filing a false tax return. He failed to declare accounts at UBS,
where he once had $200 million. He received two years’ probation
and paid $52 million in back taxes, interest and penalties.  Raoul Weil: A former chief executive officer of global wealth
management at UBS, Weil was indicted in November 2008 in Fort
Lauderdale on a charge of helping wealthy Americans hide assets
from the IRS. He was declared a fugitive in January 2009.  Renzo Gadola: A UBS banker from 1995 to 2008, Gadola pleaded
guilty in December 2010 to conspiring with a Swiss banker to
encourage U.S. clients to move undeclared UBS accounts to Basler
Kantonalbank, based in Basel,  Switzerland . Gadola and the
banker, who once worked at UBS, also told clients not to join a
program that led 18,000 Americans to declare offshore accounts
to the IRS, prosecutors said. Gadola, once a UBS executive
director who serviced hundreds of undeclared accounts, has
cooperated with prosecutors in a bid for leniency when he is
sentenced in federal court in Miami.  Marco Adami: He was one of four Credit Suisse bankers indicted
in February on a charge of conspiring to help U.S. customers
evade income taxes by using secret Swiss accounts. Adami is an
Italian national who was a member of senior management who
catered to high net worth clients in North America, prosecutors
allege. He has not appeared in court.  Emanuel Agustoni: He was one of four Credit Suisse bankers
indicted in February on a charge of conspiring to help U.S.
customers evade income taxes by using secret Swiss accounts. A

two other private Swiss banks, prosecutors alleged. He has not
appeared in court.  Michele Bergantino: He was one of four Credit Suisse bankers

customers evade income taxes by using secret Swiss accounts. A
Swiss citizen, he worked at Credit Suisse from 1982 until 2009.
