Prada SpA, the Italian producer of
Miu Miu bags and Church’s shoes, started gauging investor demand
for its  Hong Kong  initial public offering, according to a sales
document.  The Milan-based company is selling a total of about 423
million shares, among which 14 percent are new shares and the
rest are being sold by existing shareholders Prada Holding BV
and  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) , according to the document obtained by
Bloomberg News. The IPO may raise about $2 billion, two people
with knowledge of the transaction said last week.  Prada follows European companies including  L’Occitane
International SA (973)  in seeking to sell shares in Hong Kong, where
IPOs reached a record last year. Bag maker Coach Inc. and
luggage maker Samsonite LLC also plan listings in the city.  About 75 percent of the IPO proceeds will be used by Prada
for investment in new and existing stores, with the rest being
used to cut debt and for other purposes, according to the terms.  Prada is scheduled to set a price range on June 6 and list
in Hong Kong on June 24, the terms show.  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , Intesa Sanpaolo’s Banca IMI SpA, Credit
Agricole SA’s CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets and  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)  are managing the IPO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
