Taiwan ’s dollar slid the most in more
than two years as global funds reduced holdings of the island’s
assets on concern  Europe ’s worsening debt crisis will damp
appetite for emerging-market assets.  Overseas investors sold $432 million more local shares than
they bought today, the most since March 11, exchange data
showed. Taiwan’s industrial output rose 6.85 percent in April
from a year ago, the least since September 2009, the government
reported toward the end of trading today. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan
Asia Dollar Index dropped for a second day after  Fitch Ratings 
cut Greece’s long-term debt rating to B+ last week, four notches
below investment grade.  “Problems from Europe damped risk appetite today,” said
Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based currency trader at the Union Bank
of Taiwan. “Taiwan’s dollar is stuck at the NT$28.90 level.
We’ve seen more foreign funds selling Taiwan assets.”  The  Taiwan dollar  fell 0.8 percent, the most since April
2009, to NT$29.009 against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m.
local close, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency was
trading 0.5 percent weaker at NT$28.938 four minutes before the
end of trading and extended losses on suspected intervention by
the central bank, according to two traders who declined to be
identified as the monetary authority doesn’t disclose such
details.  Government bonds  rallied after Taiwan auctioned NT$30
billion ($1 billion) of 20-year notes today. The yield on the
1.375 percent security due March 2021, the most-traded
government debt, fell two basis points to 1.424 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
