Mineros SA (MINEROS) ,  Colombia â€™s largest gold
producer, rose the most in almost a month after union workers
signed a deal that will increase salaries after they had voted
to walk off the job.  The accord with the Sintramienergetica union, which
represents about 450 workers at Medellin-based Mineros, includes
wage increases in both years of the two-year contract, union
President Luis Morales said today in a telephone interview.  The union had voted on May 14 to walk off the job.  The stock rose 1.6 percent to 6,400 pesos at 4 p.m. New
York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
