Hedge funds  cut bullish bets on hog
futures to the lowest in 19 months amid speculation that U.S.
consumers will curtail spending on pork following increases in
meat and energy costs.  Funds and other money managers reduced net-long positions,
or wagers on rising prices, by 33 percent to 13,745 futures and
options contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in the week
ended May 17, the lowest since October 2009, weekly data from
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed on May 20.  Wholesale pork on May 16 climbed to 98.31 cents a pound,
the highest since at least October 1997, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. On May 4, the national average of regular
gasoline at the pump reached $3.985 a gallon, the highest since
July 2008, according to AAA, the leading U.S. motoring
organization.  “It simply goes back to the current industry mindset that
the recent run-up in prices has done a great deal to strangle
domestic demand,” said  Dan Vaught , the owner of Vaught Futures
Insights in Altus,  Arkansas . The jump in fuel costs “doesn’t
leave a lot of room in people’s budgets for a lot of items,
particularly some of your higher-priced meat cuts,” he said.  On May 20, hog futures for July settlement rose 0.7 cent,
or 0.8 percent, to 92.325 cents a pound on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The commodity has climbed 13 percent in the
past year.  This year, wholesale pork has increased 23 percent.
Gasoline has gained 37 percent in the past 12 months.  Managed money positions include hedge funds, commodity-
trading advisers and commodity pools.  To contact the reporter on this story:
