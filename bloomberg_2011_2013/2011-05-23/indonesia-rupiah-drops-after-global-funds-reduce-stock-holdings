Indonesia ’s rupiah weakened, halting
four days of gains, after global funds reduced holdings of the
nation’s assets as  Europe ’s worsening sovereign-debt crisis
cooled demand for emerging-market assets. Benchmark bonds fell.  Overseas investors sold $39 million more Indonesian shares
than they bought last week, exchange data show. The Jakarta
Composite Index slid 2.4 percent to 3,778.45 today, the biggest
decline since Jan. 10. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index
dropped for a second day after  Fitch Ratings  cut Greece’s credit
rating to B+ last week, four notches below investment grade.  “The risk of Greece defaulting on its debt hit the
regional stock markets and caused the rupiah to weaken today,”
said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst at PT Bank Commonwealth
in Jakarta. “Until the European countries get their act
together, the market will continue to be cautious.”  The rupiah lost 0.5 percent to 8,587 per dollar as of 4:16
p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has
gained 4.6 percent this year, the second-best performance among
Asia’s 10 most-traded currencies.  Ten-year  government bonds  dropped. The yield on the 8.25
percent note due July 2021 climbed six basis points or 0.06
percentage points to 7.47 percent, according to closing prices
from the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
