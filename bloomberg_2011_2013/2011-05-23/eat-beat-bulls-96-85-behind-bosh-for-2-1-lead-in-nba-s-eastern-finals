The Miami Heat remained undefeated at
home in the National Basketball Association’s postseason,
pulling away for a 96-85 win over the  Chicago Bulls  in Game 3 of
the Eastern Conference finals.  Chris Bosh  scored 34 points for Miami, which has won two
straight after losing Game 1 of the best-of-seven series.  “I just wanted to be aggressive and have an imprint on
this series,” Bosh said during a televised interview.  LeBron James  added 22 points and 10 assists for the Heat,
who improved to 7-0 at home in the playoffs this season and host
Game 4 tomorrow at AmericanAirlines Arena.  The Eastern Conference champion will play the  Dallas
Mavericks  or Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Finals. The
Thunder host the Mavericks tonight, down 2-1 in the Western
Conference finals.  Bosh missed his first three shots last night and then hit
13 of his next 15 attempts to carry the Miami offense. While
Bosh scored nine straight points early in the fourth quarter, it
was Miami’s defense that helped break the game open.  Leading 78-74 with 6:39 left, the Heat scored nine
unanswered points to open a 13-point advantage. The surge was
sparked by two steals and a blocked shot by James.  Chicago , the No. 1 seed in the East, didn’t get closer than
seven points over the final five minutes.  Carlos Boozer  had 26 points and 17 rebounds to lead the
top-seeded Bulls, who tied their longest losing streak of the
season. Chicago last dropped consecutive games Feb. 5 and 7.  Derrick Rose  added 20 points for the Bulls, who were
outscored 28-20 in the fourth quarter. Chicago had been held to
a franchise playoff-low 10 points in the fourth quarter of its
85-75 loss in Game 2.  “It’s tough to lose,” said Bulls center Joakim Noah, who
was held to one point and five rebounds. “But we’re lucky
enough to have another game on Tuesday and we’ll be ready for
that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
