Mauritius’s rupee depreciated for the
first time in a week against the dollar and stocks fell the most
in more than two months as the debt crisis in  Europe , the
nation’s main market, curbed demand for emerging-market assets.  The rupee weakened 2.2 percent to 28.55 per dollar, by 3:15
p.m., in  Port Louis , the capital, the weakest since April 6. The
37-member SEMDEX index of stocks declined 0.6 percent to close
at 2,085.45, the biggest drop since March 18.  Emerging-market stocks slipped to a two-month low after
 Fitch Ratings  cut Greece’s credit rating by three levels on May
20, citing the challenge of fiscal and structural reform needed
to secure the state’s solvency.  Standard & Poor’s  lowered
Italy’s rating outlook to negative on the same day. The euro
depreciated as much as 1.4 percent to $1.3970, the weakest since
March 17.  “The strength of the Mauritian rupee is determined by the
dollar versus euro exchange rate,” Imrith Ramtohul, a senior
investment manager who oversees 6 billion rupees ($210.2
million) of assets at  Mauritius Union Assurance Co. (MUA) , said in a
phone interview. “The rising concerns of a debt crisis in
Europe today resulted in a weaker euro, hence impacting on the
local currency.”  Europe accounted for 67 percent of tourist arrivals in the
Indian Ocean Island nation, the Mauritius Tourism Promotion
Authority said April 22. The continent bought 63.4 percent of
the country’s produce in 2010, the data agency said on March 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
