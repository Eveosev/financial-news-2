Telefonica SA (TEF)  is considering
extending the period in which it will reduce its workforce from
three years to five years,  El Pais  newspaper reported, citing
unidentified people close to the plans.  The number of people affected, which under the original
plan was 20 percent of the workforce, or about 6,000 employees,
may be different with the new period, the newspaper said.  As part of the negotiations, Spanish workersâ€™ unions want a
longer and more stable collective wage bargaining agreement for
those employees who remain, and guarantees of no more reductions
in the workforce in the two years after the cuts, regardless of
the situation of the business in  Spain , El Pais said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
