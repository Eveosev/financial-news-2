China ’s benchmark stock index fell
the most in four months, erasing this year’s gain, on concern
government measures to tighten liquidity and the European debt
crisis will slow growth in the world’s second-largest economy.  Jiangxi Copper Co. tumbled after a preliminary reading of a
purchasing managers’ index showed China’s manufacturing may
expand at a slower pace this month. PetroChina Co., the nation’s
largest oil producer, sank to a six-month low as crude dropped
after  Fitch Ratings  cut Greece by three grades. Poly Real Estate
Group Co. paced declines by real-estate companies as the
country’s money-market rate rose.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, slid 83.89, or 2.9 percent, to 2,774.57
at the 3 p.m. local-time close, erasing this year’s advance of
as much as 8.9 percent. Today’s decline was the largest since
Jan. 17. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  slumped 3.2 percent to 3,022.98.  “ Europe ’s debt crisis and signs of slowing economic growth
in China have hurt investors’ sentiment,” said Luo Bin, general
manager at Shanghai Mingyu Xiaoyang Investment Management Co.,
which manages the equivalent of $60 million. “We need to be
cautious now and it may be still some way before the market has
found its bottom.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
