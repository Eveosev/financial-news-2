Sparx Group Co. aims to return to
profit and resume dividend payments this year as it accelerates
efforts to expand in  Asia  through acquired units in South Korea
and  Hong Kong , Chief Executive Officer Shuhei Abe said.  “The phase of cutting costs is over,” Abe said at a
meeting of investors in  Tokyo  today. “From now on, our biggest
challenge is how to grow our top line as we rebuild our
business.”  The Tokyo-based asset manager swung to a loss of 3.7
billion yen ($45 million) for the year ended March 31 as fee
income declined. Earnings have been weighed down by charges to
write off losses on the acquisition of its units in Asia.  Abe said Sparx will expand offerings in environment-related
areas. It will start on June 1 an Asian long-short hedge fund
using $10 million of the company’s own cash as  seed capital , he
said.  The company’s shares have declined 14 percent this year and
lost 0.9 percent to 7,830 yen on Tokyo’s Jasdaq exchange today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
