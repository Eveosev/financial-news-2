Novak Djokovic extended his unbeaten
run since the start of the season to 38 straight matches with a
win over Thiemo de Bakker of the Netherlands at the  French Open .  Djokovic, a Serb seeded No. 2, won 6-2, 6-1, 6-3, at  Roland
Garros  in Paris to move to the second round, and closer to John McEnroe’s 1984 record of 42 straight victories to start a
season. Former champion  Roger Federer  and women’s top seed
 Caroline Wozniacki  also won in straight sets.  Djokovic has won seven titles this season and is trying to
be the first man to take the French and Australian titles back-
to-back since American Jim Courier in 1992. The 24-year-old
Djokovic will take the ATP World Tour’s top spot from Rafael Nadal by reaching the final at Roland Garros. He beat Nadal of
Spain in two clay court tournaments leading up to Paris.  “It was a great first match for me in Roland Garros,”
Djokovic said at a news conference. “I was being very cautious,
because I knew that De Bakker has quality, good serve, can play
well on the clay courts.”  Federer, the tournament’s third seed from Switzerland, beat
Feliciano Lopez of Spain, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3). Federer, formerly
No. 1 in the world, won his lone  French Open  title in 2009. He
hasn’t won a major championship since he extended his men’s
record Grand Slam singles haul to 16 at last year’s Australian
Open.  “I played well,” Federer said in a courtside interview.
“Novak has had a super year, but I’ve had a good year. I feel
like I can do something big here.”  Age Gap  Wozniacki of Denmark eased past Kimiko Date-Krumm, 6-0, 6-
2. The 40-year-old Japanese player competed in her first French
Open in 1989, a year before Wozniacki was born. Wozniacki, who
is seeking her first major championship, entered Roland Garros
with a tournament win in Brussels, her first on clay.  Francesca Schiavone started the defense of her women’s
title with a straight-set win over  Melanie Oudin  of the U.S.
Schiavone, the first Italian woman to win one of the four tennis
majors, won 6-2, 6-0 on Court Philippe Chatrier, the
tournament’s main arena.  “I’m still shaking a little bit,” Schiavone said at a
news conference. “A lot of adrenaline. I felt really happy to
be there. That court is fantastic.”  Third seed Vera Zvonareva of Russia, runner-up at Wimbledon
and the U.S. Open, beat Lourdes Dominguez Lino of  Spain  6-3, 6-
3. Wimbledon semifinalist  Petra Kvitova , the No. 9 seed from the
 Czech Republic , beat Greta Arn of Hungary 6-2, 6-1.  Marion Bartoli , a former Wimbledon runner-up and the No. 11
seed from France, beat Anna Tatishvili of Georgia, 1-6, 6-2, 6-
1. Russia’s Nadia Petrova, seeded 26th, lost to Anastasia
Rodionova of  Australia , 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 6-4.  Berdych Ousted  Wimbledon runner-up Tomas Berdych was upset in the first
round by French qualifier Stephane Robert, 3-6, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2,
9-7. The Czech was seeded sixth in Paris.  Juan Martin del Potro, the 2009 U.S. Open champion from
Argentina who almost had to pull out of the French Open because
of a hip injury, defeated Croatia’s Ivo Karlovic 6-7 (7-9), 6-3,
7-5, 6-4.  Russia ’s Mikhail Youzhny, the 12th seed, downed
 Japan ’s Go Soeda 7-5, 6-2, 6-4, and Thomaz Bellucci of  Brazil 
Beat Andrey Golubev of Kazakhstan 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (7-5).  Ninth-seeded Gael Monfils of France beat Bjorn Phau of
 Germany  6-4, 3-6, 7-5, 6-0, while Steve Darcis of Belgium upset
No. 22 Michael Llodra of France 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 6-3, 6-3.  Russia’s Nikolay Davydenko, a semifinalist in 2007, beat
Denis Gremelmayr of Germany, 7-6 (7-2), 6-1, 6-3. Mardy Fish,
the top American man at No. 10, beat Brazil’s Ricardo Mello 6-2,
6-7 (11-13), 6-2, 6-4.  Women’s Seeds  Daniela Hantuchova, the 28th seed, beat Shuai Zhang of
 China  6-3, 6-3, while Sania Mirza of  India  beat Kristina Barrois
of Germany 6-3, 6-3.  Sara Errani of Italy defeated Christina McHale of the U.S.
6-7 (4-7), 6-2, 9-7 and Vesna Dolonts of Russia beat Anne Keothavong of Britain, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4.  Agnieszka Radwanska, the 12th seed from Poland, beat
Austria’s Patricia Mayr-Achleitner 6-1, 6-2. China’s Jie Zheng
won over Sandra Zahlavova of the Czech Republic 6-4, 6-3.  Oudin, a quarterfinalist at the 2009  U.S. Open , struggled
with her serve against Schiavone, who beat Australia’s Samantha Stosur in last year’s Paris final. Oudin, one of nine American
women in the draw, is now 1-9 on clay courts this year. The
American has dropped to No. 88 in the WTA rankings, after a
career-best No. 31 in April 2010.  “I think that the court here definitely bounces higher
than some of the other courts,” Oudin told reporters. “That
helps her a ton. I mean, she is serving well, she’s moving well,
she pretty much doesn’t have a weakness on the clay, I don’t
think.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
