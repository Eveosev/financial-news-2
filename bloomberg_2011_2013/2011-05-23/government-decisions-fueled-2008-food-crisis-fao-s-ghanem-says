Government policy decisions
contributed to the 2008 food crisis, said Hafez Ghanem,
assistant director-general at the  United Nations ’  Food and
Agriculture Organization . Following are comments he made at a
conference on  food security  in Brussels today:  “If every country continues to take decisions to protect
its own population, and doesn’t look further than the short-
term, the result is often that everyone loses.  ‘‘In 2008, the food crisis and especially the increase of
the rice price was due largely to political choices. In 2008,
the production of rice was good, the stocks were high and
consumption was stable.  ‘‘What we saw is that the price of rice doubled in 2008,
and that is explained mainly by the decision of certain
countries to halt their exports. This crisis could have been
avoided.’’  ‘‘Bad government policies have been a reason for
volatility.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
