An Afghan policewoman shot and
killed an American civilian contractor working with NATO forces
in the capital Kabul, police said.  The shooting occurred at police headquarters today, Deputy
Police Chief Mohammad Dawood Amin said. It wasn’t clear if the
shooting was intentional and the alleged assailant has been
arrested, Amin said.  The victim was a civilian contract adviser working for the
International Security Assistance Force, ISAF spokesman Josh
Woods said in a phone interview today.  The adviser was shot as he looked at a case of decorative
medals, the Washington Post reported, citing unidentified Afghan
police. The report cited another unidentified Afghan official as
saying the adviser worked at the Interior Ministry, which
controls the Afghan police, while the attacker worked in the
ministry’s department of gender rights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
