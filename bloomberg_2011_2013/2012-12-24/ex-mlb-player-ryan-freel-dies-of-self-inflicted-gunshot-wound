Ryan Freel, whose eight-year Major
League Baseball career was cut short in 2009 by concussions and
other injuries, was found dead over the weekend at his home in
Jacksonville,  Florida . He was 36.  Police are treating Freel’s death as a suicide from what
appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the Jacksonville
Sheriff’s Office told the  Florida Times-Union . The medical
examiner will officially determine the cause of death.  A voicemail message and multiple telephone calls to the
sheriff’s office public information department seeking comment
on Freel’s death weren’t immediately returned.  Freel spent six of his eight seasons with the  Cincinnati
Reds , hitting .268 with 143 stolen bases in 594 games. He played
second base, third base and the outfield, and was known for his
hustle and reckless style of play.  “The Reds family is deeply saddened to hear of the death
of Ryan Freel,” the team said in a statement. “His teammates
and our fans loved him for how hard he played the game, and he
loved giving back to the community. Our thoughts and prayers are
with his family and friends.”  Freel once said he sustained as many as 10 concussions
during his major-league career, and injuries limited him to 75
games in 2007 and 48 games in 2008. He sat out 30 games during
the 2007 season after suffering a concussion in an outfield
collision with teammate Norris Hopper, an injury that led Freel
to be taken off the field in an ambulance.  Contract Numbers  Freel had 37 stolen bases for the Reds in 2004 and 2006,
and stole 36 bases in 2005. After hitting .271 with eight home
runs and 27 runs batted in for Cincinnati in 2006, Freel
received a $2.3 million contract for 2007 and the following
season got a two-year deal worth $7 million.  Freel left the Reds after the 2008 campaign as part of a
trade that brought catcher Ramon Hernandez to Cincinnati. Freel
played with the  Baltimore Orioles ,  Chicago Cubs  and  Kansas City
Royals  during his final major-league season in 2009.  “He was a guy who was always all in, the way he tried very
hard and hustled like he did,” Freel’s former agent, Tommy Tanzer, told MLB.com. “He played all out and he lived that way
too.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
