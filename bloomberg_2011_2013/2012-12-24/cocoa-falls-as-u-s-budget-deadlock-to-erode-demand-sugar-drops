Cocoa futures fell to the lowest in
almost five months on concern that an impasse in U.S. budget
talks will erode demand for riskier assets such as commodities.
Sugar and orange juice also dropped. Coffee and cotton rose.  Senator Joseph Lieberman said yesterday that time is
running out for U.S. lawmakers to agree on a budget deal to
avoid more than $600 billion in automatic tax increases and
spending cuts known as the fiscal cliff. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index slumped for a second session, while the S&P GSCI Spot
Index of 24 raw materials declined to the lowest in a week.  “Without a resolution in the fiscal cliff, we could see
the U.S. fall back into recession, and that could cause a net
withdrawal of investor capital,” Michael McDougall, a senior
vice president at Newedge Group in New York, said today in a
report.  Cocoa for March delivery retreated 1.7 percent to settle at
$2,273 a metric ton at 1 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
