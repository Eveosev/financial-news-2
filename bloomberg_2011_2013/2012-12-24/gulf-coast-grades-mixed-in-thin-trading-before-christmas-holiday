Gulf Coast oil grades were mixed in
light trading before the Christmas holiday, with sweet crudes
higher and sour mostly losing ground.  Today was also the last of three days cash-market
participants have to close their books for January. The period
is typically characterized by light volume and erratic pricing.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to benchmark West Texas
Intermediate widened $1.50 to $21 a barrel at 1:46 p.m.  New York 
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana
Sweet rose $1.50 to $21.50 a barrel over WTI.  The premium for Mars Blend to WTI narrowed 25 cents to
$14.50 a barrel. Southern Green Canyon sank 75 cents to $12.50 a
barrel over WTI.  Thunder Horse  dropped $1.75 to an $18-a-barrel premium to
the U.S. benchmark. Poseidon’s premium to WTI widened 50 cents
to $14.75 a barrel.  The discount for West Texas Sour to WTI widened $3.50 to
$17.50 a barrel, while WTI in Midland sank $1.50 to $10 under
WTI in Cushing.  Canadian crudes were unchanged, with Western Canada Select
at a $34-a-barrel discount to WTI and Syncrude holding at 50
cents above the benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
