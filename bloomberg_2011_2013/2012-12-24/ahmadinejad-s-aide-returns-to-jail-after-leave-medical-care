Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s press adviser, who received medical care during a
four-day leave from jail, returned to prison today, the  Iranian
Students News Agency  reported, citing a top judiciary official.  Ali Akbar Javanfekr checked himself into the jail where he
is serving a six-month sentence for the publication of
controversial material, Prosecutor General Abbas Jafari-
Dolatabadi said according to the state-run  news agency .  Javanfekr received treatment for heart problems at the
capital’s Atieh hospital, according to reports published today
in local media including the Tehran-based  Etemaad  newspaper.
Ahmadinejad visited his aide in the hospital yesterday.  Ahmadinejad’s requests to visit his media adviser while in
detention were turned down by the head of the judiciary, leading
to an exchange of verbal diatribes between the two men. The
incident highlighted frictions in the ruling elite at a time
when international sanctions over  Iran’s nuclear program  are
taking their toll on the economy.  Javanfekr, who oversaw the official  Islamic Republic News
Agency , was imprisoned on Sept. 26 on charges of insulting
Supreme Leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  and publishing an article
questioning the history of Iran’s head-to-toe robe worn by some
women. He was cleared of this accusation last month, according
to a Nov. 19 report in the  Iranian Students News Agency , though
he will still serve time in Evin prison for publishing offensive
material on Islamic norms, ISNA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
