Ethanol weakened against gasoline
with stockpiles of the biofuel at a six-month high.  Futures have fallen 7.5 percent this month, poised for the
worst monthly performance since September, as  inventories  in the
week ended Dec. 14 were 20.8 million barrels, up 18 percent from
a year earlier. The discount to gasoline makes ethanol more
attractive to blenders who stand to pocket the difference
between the two fuels.  “You’re at a pretty attractive price point relative to
gasoline,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in
 Chicago . “You’ve really improved your competitiveness to
gasoline.”  Ethanol’s discount to the motor fuel expanded to 52.26
cents a gallon  New York  time based on settlement prices. It was
50.97 cents Dec. 21 and 18.79 cents on Dec. 6. The differential
has averaged about 61 cents this year.  Denatured ethanol for January delivery rose 0.3 cent to
settle at $2.228 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in New York
at $2.32 a gallon, in Chicago at $2.21, in the U.S. Gulf at
$2.265 and on the West Coast at $2.355 a gallon, data compiled
by Bloomberg shows.  Gasoline for January delivery advanced 1.59 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.7506 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for March delivery added 2.25 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to $7.0425 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 30 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, up from 29
cents Dec. 21, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed from
the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol
production that can be fed to livestock, according to data
collected by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
