China ’s overnight money-market rate
dropped for a second day on speculation the central bank will
inject capital to prevent cash shortage before national
holidays.  The People’s Bank of gauged demand for possible auctions of
seven-, 14- and 28-day reverse-repurchase contracts this week,
according to a trader required to bid at the auctions. The
central bank  injected  a net 92 billion  yuan  ($14.8 billion) into
the financial system using money-market operations last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Liquidity is quite stable,” said Liu Junyu, a bond
analyst in Shenzhen at China Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s
sixth biggest lender. “Banks are expecting the central bank to
offer reverse repos if there is a jump in cash demand.”  The one-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 12 basis points to 2.30 percent as
of 10:25 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average rate
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  Demand for cash climbs before the weeklong break for
Chinese New Year commences Feb. 11, a period in which families
exchange gifts and get together for meals. China also has a
three-day holiday starting Jan. 1.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, gained one basis
points to 3.36 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  -- Judy Chen . Editors:  James Regan , Anil Varma  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
