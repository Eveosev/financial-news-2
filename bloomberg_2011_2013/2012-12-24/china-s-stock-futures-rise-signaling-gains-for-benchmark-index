China’s stocks  rose, extending a
weekly gain, as rallies for automakers and technology companies
overshadowed losses for consumer-staples producers.  SAIC Motor Corp. (600104)  led an advance for automakers after
Shenyin & Wanguo Securities said car sales jumped 20 percent in
the first two weeks of this month. BOE Technology Group Co.,
 China ’s biggest maker of liquid-crystal-display panels, climbed
the most in two weeks after it said it will set up a company
with the Chongqing government. Liquor maker  Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519) 
slid 5.6 percent after authorities announced measures to rein in
luxury spending by military officials.  “There’s a light news flow,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-
based  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285
million. “We’ve seen a decent rally this month and buying
sentiment will probably continue after stocks consolidate around
this level. The economic momentum remains unchanged.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.3 percent to 2,159.05
at the close, adding to a 0.1 percent gain last week. The  CSI
300 Index (SHSZ300)  gained 0.4 percent to 2,381.22. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in  Hong Kong 
advanced 0.4 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the
measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, fell
1.3 percent in  New York  on Dec. 21.  The Shanghai Composite has risen 10 percent since Dec. 3,
when it closed at its lowest level since January 2009, on signs
the economic recovery is gathering momentum. The measure, down
1.6 percent this year, trades at 10.5 times estimated earnings,
the highest since May, according to weekly  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Rising Liquidity  Trading volumes in the Shanghai index were 2.8 percent
higher than the 30-day average today. Thirty-day  volatility  in
the gauge was at 19.4, compared with this year’s average of 17.  Supplies of cash in China are the most plentiful in three
years in the run-up to public holidays, after policy makers told
the central bank to ensure companies have enough funds to
support economic growth.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , a gauge of interbank funding
availability, averaged 3.05 percent in December, the lowest for
this month since 2009 and down from 3.89 percent a year earlier,
according to the National Interbank Funding Center. The central
bank has conducted reverse-repurchase contract  operations  twice
a week since July to meet lenders’ cash needs, and injected a
net 92 billion  yuan  ($14.8 billion) of  capital  into the
financial system last week.  Auto Sales  SAIC Motor, China’s largest carmaker, added 0.9 percent to
16.63 yuan.  FAW Car Co. (000800) , which makes cars in China with
Volkswagen AG, jumped 8.9 percent to 8.58 yuan. Jiangsu Yueda
Investment Co., which makes cars with Kia Motors Corp., gained
3.8 percent to 11.57 yuan.  Shenyin & Wanguo said car sales rose 20 percent in the
first two weeks of this month, compared with a year earlier.
Auto demand will improve and the valuation expansion for
industry stocks will continue, Li Xiaoguang, an analyst at the
brokerage, wrote in a report today.  BOE surged 5.1 percent to 2.25 yuan, its biggest gain since
Dec. 5. BOE and the Chongqing city government will set up a
company with registered capital of 26 million yuan ($4.2
million), according to an exchange statement.  A gauge of consumer-staples stocks in the CSI 300 tumbled
2.2 percent, the  most  among 10 industry groups. Kweichow Moutai,
the biggest maker of baijiu liquor, slumped 5.6 percent to
204.58 yuan.  Wuliangye Yibin Co. (000858) , the second largest, fell 3
percent to 26.94 yuan. Jiangsu Yanghe Brewery Joint-Stock Co.
slid 5 percent to 87.43 yuan.  Luxury Ban  The new rules for high-ranking military officials include
bans on extravagant banquets and staying in civilian or military
hotels with luxury perks, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported on Dec 22.  “Although the ban is a sweeping ban on most luxury
spending, baijiu is probably the most visible and obvious
product,” Wang Ping, an analyst at Great Wall Securities Co. in
Shenzhen, said by phone today. “This will add pressure to the
excess inventory problem already faced by baijiu makers such as
Moutai.”  The iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund, the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., declined 1.3 percent on Dec.
21 for a weekly loss of 0.3 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
