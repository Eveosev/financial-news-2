Sugar, heading for a second straight
annual drop, retreated in New York on signs of large supplies
from top producers  Brazil  and  India  and weak demand. Cocoa slid.  Sugar output in Brazil’s center south, the main producing
region of the world’s biggest grower, will total 34.05 million
metric tons in 2012-13, up from a previous forecast of 32.7
million tons, industry group Unica said Dec. 20. Sugar
production in second-ranking India was 4.8 million tons from
Oct. 1 through Dec. 15, the Indian Sugar Mills Association said.
Weak demand for Brazilian sugar is reflected in discounts being
offered for the sweetener, according to Archer Consulting.  “We expect the third consecutive global surplus in 2012-
13, amid stronger-than-expected production in Brazil and better-
than-expected production from India,” Kate Tang, an analyst at
Barclays Plc in  London , said in a report e-mailed Dec. 21. The
glut will “continue to pressure the sugar market.”  Raw sugar for March delivery dropped 0.3 percent to 19.20
cents a pound by 7:45 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
White, or refined, sugar for March delivery fell 0.3 percent to
$516.50 a ton on NSYE Liffe in London.  The global sugar surplus will be 1 million tons higher with
bigger-than-expected output from Brazil’s center south, said
Paul Bannister, head of sugar brokerage operations at Marex
Spectron Group. Raw sugar from Brazil for loading this month was
at a discount of 0.5 cent to 0.7 cent a pound to the price on
ICE, Arnaldo Luiz Correa, a director at Sao Paulo-based Archer
Consulting, said in a report e-mailed Dec. 22.  Raw sugar lost 18 percent this year after sliding 27
percent in 2011, the biggest decline in a decade. Prices swung
between 18.81 cents a pound and 19.46 cents a pound last week.  Producer Sales  “It appears that two things happen on price weakness. The
first is that the producers stop selling, confident that the
Brazilian government will raise the domestic gasoline price and
with it the ethanol floor under the market,” Kingsman SA said
in a report e-mailed today. “The second is that end-users and
importers get on with their pricing and their physical buying.”  Cocoa for March delivery fell 0.6 percent to $2,299 a ton
ICE. It’s up 9 percent this year. Cocoa for March delivery fell
0.6 percent to 1,460 pounds ($2,361) a ton on NYSE Liffe. The
