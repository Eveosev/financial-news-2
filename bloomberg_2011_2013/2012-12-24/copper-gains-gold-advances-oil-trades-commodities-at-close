24 commodities fell 0.1 percent to 638.37 at 4:37 p.m.  Singapore 
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials dropped
0.2 percent to 1,570.839.  CRUDE OIL  Oil traded near the lowest level in almost a week in  New
York  on concern U.S. lawmakers may fail to avert spending cuts
and tax increases that threaten the economy of the world’s
biggest crude consumer.  Crude for February delivery was at $88.54 a barrel, down 12
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 3:15 p.m. Singapore time. Prices fell $1.47 to $88.66 a
barrel on Dec. 21, the biggest decline since Dec. 6. The volume
for all West Texas Intermediate futures traded today was about
57 percent lower than the 100-day average.  OIL PRODUCTS  Asia ’s naphtha crack spread extended gains, signaling
increased profit for refiners. PetroChina Co. bought a jet fuel
cargo for a third day in Singapore, the region’s largest oil-
trading center.  The premium of Japan naphtha to London-traded Brent crude
futures rose $2.81 to $117.83 a metric ton at 1:55 p.m.
Singapore time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This
crack spread, a measure of the profit from making the
petrochemical and gasoline feedstock, widened for a third day,
the longest stretch of increases since October.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude dropped 28
cents to $20.26 a barrel at 1:55 p.m. Singapore time, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The difference,
also known as the crack spread, shrank for the first time in
three days.  BASE METALS  Copper gained for a second day in  London  as U.S. data
showed demand from the second-largest user may improve. Aluminum
and nickel also advanced.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold advanced after its worst week in six months, erasing
an earlier decline, as investors weighed concerns U.S. lawmakers
will fail to agree on a deal before a year-end budget deadline
as talks stalled.  Gold for immediate delivery rose 0.3 percent to $1,662.38
an ounce at 2:51 p.m. in Singapore. Earlier the metal dropped as
much as 0.3 percent to $1,652.20. Prices fell 2.3 percent last
week, the biggest loss since the period ended June 22.  Silver for immediate delivery rose as much as 0.7 percent
to $30.2225 an ounce and traded at $30.2175. Prices dropped 7
percent last week, the worst week since December 2011, trimming
this year’s gain to 8.3 percent.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans climbed for a second day on expectations supply
may remain constrained through the next two months before
Brazilian crops reach markets. Corn and wheat rose.  Soybeans for March delivery advanced as much as 0.8 percent
to $14.4125 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and were at
$14.355 by 2:07 p.m. in Singapore. The most-active contract lost
4.2 percent last week, the first drop in five.  Corn for March delivery increased 0.4 percent to $7.045 a
bushel, set for a 6.4 percent drop this month, which would be a
fifth consecutive loss. Corn, which surged to a record in
August, has advanced 9 percent this year.  Wheat for March delivery rose 0.4 percent to $7.9525 a
bushel, poised for a 7.9 percent monthly drop.  Palm oil  climbed to the highest level in almost four weeks
on speculation that demand will gain in  China , the world’s
biggest cooking oil buyer, and reduce record inventories in
 Malaysia , the top producer after  Indonesia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
