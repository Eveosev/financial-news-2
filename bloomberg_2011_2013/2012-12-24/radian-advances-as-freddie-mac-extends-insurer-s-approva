Radian Group Inc. (RDN) , the mortgage
insurer whose stock more than doubled this year, advanced in  New
York  trading after Freddie Mac extended the approval of a
subsidiary to sell coverage.  Radian  gained  5.3 percent to $5.40 at 1:24 p.m. It has
rallied more than 130 percent this year. Rival  MGIC Investment
Corp. (MTG)  rose 2.1 percent. Trading on the New York Stock Exchange
closed early today ahead of the Christmas holiday.  Freddie Mac, the government mortgage buyer, approved Radian
Mortgage Assurance to write coverage through the end of next
year, Philadelphia-based Radian said in a statement after the
close of trading on Dec. 21. The approval gives Radian a method
to continue selling insurance if other units breach regulatory
limits of risk relative to capital, according to the statement.  “This helps to improve the credit composition of our
mortgage insurance book and better position Radian for a return
to operating profitability next year,” Chief Executive Officer
S.A. Ibrahim said in the statement.  Some of Radian’s competitors including  PMI Group Inc. (PPMIQ)  and
 Triad Guaranty Inc. (TGIC)  were forced to stop selling new policies
after falling short of the standards as losses backing home
loans drained capital. Mortgage insurers cover losses when
homeowners default and foreclosures fail to recoup costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
