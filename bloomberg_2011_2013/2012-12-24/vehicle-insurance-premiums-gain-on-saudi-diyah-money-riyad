Saudi insurance companies doubled
insurance premiums after the kingdom raised the amount of
compensation paid to the families of people who have been
killed,  al-Riyadh  newspaper reported, citing Shura Council
member Fahad al-Anizi.  So-called Diyah is now estimated at 400,000 riyals
($107,000) for murder and 300,000 riyals for wrongful killings
compared with 100,000 riyals over the past 30 years, the
newspaper said.  The increase is due to rising camel prices in the past few
years, a reference for Diyah under Islamic law, al-Riyadh
reported, citing al-Anizi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
