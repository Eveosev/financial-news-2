China Rongsheng Heavy Industries
Group Holdings Ltd. (1101) , the country’s largest shipbuilder outside
state control, forecast its first annual loss in four years as
vessel prices and orders slump.  The company is expected to post a  net loss  this year based
on unaudited accounts for 11 months ended Nov. 30, China
Rongsheng said in a stock exchange filing today. It didn’t
disclose any numbers.  First-half profit of the company plunged 82 percent as a
global overcapacity and lower charter rates deterred shipowners
from ordering more vessels. China Rongsheng is setting up a new
offshore-energy equipment unit as it seeks contracts for oil
rigs and tender barges to offset slowing ship demand.  China Rongsheng  dropped  1.5 percent to HK$1.35 as of 2 p.m.
in Hong Kong trading. The city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index  rose
0.2 percent. The forecast was released during the lunchtime
trading break.  The shipbuilder previously posted an annual loss in 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was expected to
report a profit of 563 million  yuan  ($90 million) this year,
according to the  average  of 5 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Shipyards in China won 12.6 million deadweight tons of
orders in the first nine months of the year, compared with 23.9
million a year earlier, according to  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the world’s
biggest shipbroker. Their backlogs fell to 116.4 million tons at
the end of September from 169.3 million tons at the end of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
