The leu strengthened to the highest
level in more than seven months after Prime Minister Victor Ponta won parliamentary backing for his new cabinet on Dec. 21,
boosting investors’ confidence in  Romania ’s political stability
post elections.  The currency gained 0.5 percent to 4.4205 per euro by 4:30
p.m. in Bucharest, its highest level since May 10. The leu has
appreciated 2.5 percent since Romania went to polls on Dec. 9,
making it the best performer among emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  Ponta’s new government, his second this year, won 402 votes
out of a total of 588. The prime minister is also counting on a
two-thirds majority in Parliament to pass a 2013 budget and
start talks with the International Monetary Fund and the
European Union in January to renew the nation’s stability
accord.  “The new cabinet and the improved perception of stability
in the country is a good signal for the leu,” Ponta said while
addressing ministers at a Dec. 22 meeting in Bucharest. “We can
see that the euro-leu exchange rate is at the lowest level since
we formed our first cabinet” in May, he said.  Yields on Romania’s 2019 euro-denominated bonds declined
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point to 3.98 percent today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
