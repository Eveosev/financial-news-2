India’s five-year  interest-rate
swaps  traded near a one-month high on signs a cash squeeze in
the banking system is worsening after companies paid quarterly
taxes this month.  Local lenders  borrowed  an average 1.6 trillion rupees ($29
billion) a day from the central bank last week to meet
shortages, compared with 909 billion rupees in the previous five
days, official figures show. Indian companies were due to make
tax payments by Dec. 15.  “Swaps are reflecting the liquidity squeeze in the banking
system,” said Srinivasa Raghavan, executive vice president of
treasury at  Dhanlaxmi Bank Ltd. (DHLBK)  in Mumbai.  The fixed payment to lock in five-year borrowing costs rose
one basis point to 7.1850 percent in Mumbai, matching the level
touched on Nov. 26, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the benchmark 8.15 percent government bonds
due June 2022 fell one basis point to 8.13 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
