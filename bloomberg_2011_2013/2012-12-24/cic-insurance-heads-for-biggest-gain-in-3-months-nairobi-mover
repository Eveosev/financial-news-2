CIC Insurance Group Ltd. (CIC) ,  Kenya ’s
second-biggest insurer by premiums, gained in Nairobi trading
amid speculation full-year income will grow as much as 12
percent.  The shares climbed 2.9 percent to 3.50 shillings by the
close in the capital, the biggest gain since Dec. 20. About 94
percent of the three-month average volume of shares traded,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Profit in 2012 will be 678 million shillings ($7.89
million) compared with 604 million shillings in 2011, Francis Mwangi, head of research at Nairobi-based Standard Investment
Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  “CIC is one of the fastest growing insurance companies
because of its positioning in the low end of the market,” he
said. Profit in the 12 months to December will be boosted by
investment income, while income from insurance premiums is also
projected to increase, he said.  First-half profit fell 12 percent to 415.1 million
shillings after costs and claims increased, CIC said in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
