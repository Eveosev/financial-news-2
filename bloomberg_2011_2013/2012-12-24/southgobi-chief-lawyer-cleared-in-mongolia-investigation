SouthGobi Resources Ltd. (1878) , controlled
by a unit of Rio Tinto Group, said its chief lawyer Sarah
Armstrong has been cleared in a probe by the Mongolian
Independent Authority Against Corruption and is free to leave
the country after being prevented to do so since October.  The coal mining company, based in  Vancouver , continues to
be under investigation for “the divestment of certain SouthGobi
licenses to third parties, and the involvement and conduct of
government officials in connection with this,” according to a
statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange today.  SouthGobi  fell  1.6 percent to HK$15.58 at the early
Christmas-eve close in Hong Kong.  Armstrong is the company’s chief legal counsel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
