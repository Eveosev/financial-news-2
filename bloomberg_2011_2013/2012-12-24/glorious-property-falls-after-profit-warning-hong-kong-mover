Glorious Property Holdings Ltd. (845) ,
controlled by Chinese billionaire Zhang Zhirong, headed for its
biggest drop in two weeks in Hong Kong after saying full-year
profit will “significantly” decrease on project delays.  The shares declined 4.4 percent to HK$1.32 as of 10:33
a.m., local time, and headed for their biggest drop since Dec.
11. Glorious Property has lost 2.9 percent this year, compared
with a 22 percent gain in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  The Shanghai-based company alerted investors of the profit
warning in a statement to Hong Kong’s stock exchange after the
market closed on Dec. 21. It didn’t say which projects are being
delayed.  Zhang resigned as chairman of the company in November after
an  investment company  he controlled agreed to pay $14 million to
resolve U.S. insider-trading claims, saying he needs “to devote
more time to his personal endeavors.” He was replaced by Chief
Executive Officer Cheng Lixiong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
