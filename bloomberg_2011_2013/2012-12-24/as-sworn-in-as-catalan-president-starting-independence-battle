Artur Mas, who has pledged to seek
independence for Catalonia, was sworn in as president of the
region, paving the way for a battle over autonomy with Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy .  “Let’s remember that in the history of nations, the big
changes have almost always happened at very difficult times and
against the tide,” Mas said at a ceremony in Barcelona today.
“We are all protagonists of a unique moment in our history.”  Mas will govern with the support of the Catalan Republican
Left after falling short of a majority in elections last month.
As part of his deal with the separatists, Mas pledged to be
ready for an independence referendum in 2014.  Rajoy’s government in  Madrid  says any popular vote on
independence for  Spain ’s biggest regional economy would be
unconstitutional, and it would use legal measures to stop it.
Asked whether he would try to disqualify Mas from governing or
suspend the region’s autonomous status, Rajoy declined to
comment in an interview published today by El Mundo. Everyone is
“subject to the law,” he said.  Mas, whose new Cabinet will start work on Dec. 27, urged
the central government not to try to “hold back the tide” or
prevent Catalans choosing their future freely. He called for
leaders on both sides to work to prevent a “collision.”  “Let’s have faith in Catalonia,” he said. “No one and
nothing can take that great faith away from us.”
