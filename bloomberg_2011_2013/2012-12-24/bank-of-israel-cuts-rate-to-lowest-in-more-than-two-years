The Bank of  Israel  reduced its
benchmark interest rate to its lowest in more than two years as
growth and inflation slowed.  Governor Stanley Fischer and the monetary policy panel cut
the rate by a quarter-point to 1.75 percent, the Jerusalem-based
bank said on its website today. Eight of the 23 economists
 surveyed by Bloomberg  forecast the decision, while 14 predicted
no change. One forecast a half-point reduction.  “The decline in the inflationary environment and the
appreciation of the shekel,” are the main reasons for the
decision, David Reznik, head of fixed-income research at the
Leumi Capital Markets division of Tel Aviv-based Bank Leumi Le-
Israel, said prior to the announcement. “Central banks around
the world are reducing interest rates wherever they still can.”  The Bank of Israel has gradually reduced the borrowing rate
from 3.25 percent in 2011 in an effort to shore up the economy
amid the  European debt crisis . The committee left the rate
unchanged at the end of November, after an unexpected quarter-
point cut the previous month.  Economic growth  eased to an annualized 2.9 percent in the
third quarter, the slowest in three years, from 3.4 percent the
previous three months. Inflation declined to 1.4 percent in
November, the lowest since July. The government’s price-rise
target is 1 percent to 3 percent.  The shekel has strengthened by about 6 percent against the
dollar since Nov. 15, and was trading at 3.7446 shekels at 4:22
p.m. in Tel Aviv.  To contact the reporter on this story:
