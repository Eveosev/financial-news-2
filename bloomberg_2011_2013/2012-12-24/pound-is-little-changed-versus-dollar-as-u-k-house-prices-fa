The pound weakened to the lowest
level in nearly eight months against the euro as a report showed
house prices fell for a sixth month in December, strengthening
the case for the Bank of  England  to expand its stimulus.  Sterling dropped to the lowest level in more than a week
versus the dollar. Home prices in England and  Wales  slipped 0.1
percent, the same as in November, Hometrack Ltd. said today.
Values are forecast to fall 1 percent next year after a 0.3
percent decline in 2012, the London-based property research
group said. The Bank of England decided last month to halt its
375-billion pound ($606 billion) asset-purchase  program , known
as quantitative easing, designed to boost the economy.  “The move lower in the pound against the euro is a
continuation of concern that the U.K. could lose its AAA rating
in 2013 and the step up in austerity will keep the economy weak
and inspire more quantitative easing from the Bank of England,”
said Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at Rabobank
International in  London . “The weak house-price data today
doesn’t argue against those concerns.”  The pound depreciated 0.2 percent to 81.74 pence per euro
as of 1:04 p.m. in London, after trading at 81.81 pence, the
weakest level since May 1. Sterling was little changed at
$1.6171, after falling to $1.6143, the lowest since Dec. 14.  Standard & Poor’s lowered its outlook on Britain’s AAA
credit rating to negative from stable on Dec. 13, citing weak
economic growth and a worsening debt profile.  Currency Indexes  The pound has gained 1.4 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro declined 0.8 percent and
the dollar fell 3 percent.  The  10-year gilt yield  rose less than one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 1.89 percent. The 1.75 percent bond
due in September 2022 fell 0.045, or 45 pence per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 98.765. The rate dropped as much as seven basis
points on Dec. 21, the biggest decline since Nov. 28. The two-
year gilt yielded 0.34 percent.  The gilt market was scheduled to close at 12:15 p.m. in
London and will resume trading on Dec. 27.  Gilts returned 2.2 percent this year through Dec. 21,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
4 percent and Treasuries earned 2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
