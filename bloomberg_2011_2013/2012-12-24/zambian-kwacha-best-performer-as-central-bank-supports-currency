Zambia’s kwacha strengthened the
most in more than a year as the central bank was said to support
the currency of  Africa ’s biggest copper producer.  The kwacha appreciated 3.8 percent, the most since
September 2011, to 4,930 a dollar as of 3:57 p.m. in Lusaka, the
capital. That’s the best performance among all currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. The currency has advanced 6.3 percent in
the past three days.  The Bank of Zambia last week reduced the amount of foreign
currencies local banks are allowed to hold. Rising food prices
and a weaker currency have fueled inflation, which climbed to
6.9 percent in November. The central bank has been
“aggressively extending the kwacha” by selling dollars in the
market, Mwewa Kyamulanda, a currency trader with  Investrust Bank
Plc (INVESTRU) , said by phone from Lusaka.  “Politically, a strong kwacha is viewed as positive,”
Kyamulanda said. “The guy on the street is largely an importer
and the  exchange rate  drives inflation.”  Kanguya Mayondi, a spokesman for the central bank, declined
to comment when contacted by  Bloomberg News .  The government also wants to strengthen the kwacha in the
run-up to the Jan. 1 rebasing exercise, which removes three
zeros from the currency, Joseph Lungu, a Lusaka-based analyst
with Intermarket Securities Ltd., said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
