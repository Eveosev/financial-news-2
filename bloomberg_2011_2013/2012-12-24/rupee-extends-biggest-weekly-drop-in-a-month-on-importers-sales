India ’s rupee advanced on
speculation exporters sold their overseas earnings, taking
advantage of the currency’s approach toward this month’s low.  Funds based abroad bought $3.1 billion more Indian shares
than they sold this month through Dec. 20, taking their total
additions this year to $23.2 billion, according to Securities &
Exchange Board of India data. The currency had weakened earlier
after U.S. Senator  Joseph Lieberman  said time is running out for
lawmakers and President  Barack Obama  to agree on a budget deal
by year-end to avoid triggering more than $600 billion in tax
increases and spending cuts.  “The rupee has gained probably because some exporters sold
dollars,” said Vikas Babu, a currency trader at state-owned
 Andhra Bank (ANDB)  in Mumbai. “That helped overcome the bearish
undertone due to weak global cues.”  The rupee rose 0.2 percent to 54.9550 per dollar in Mumbai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It earlier touched
55.2150, approaching 55.2575 hit on Dec. 21, which was the
lowest level since Nov. 29.  The currency fell 1.1 percent last week, the biggest loss
since the five days through Nov. 9. It dropped 3.4 percent this
year after plunging 16 percent in 2011. The market will be shut
tomorrow for Christmas.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, was unchanged at 10.10
percent. The rate has decreased 190 basis points, or 1.9
percentage points, in 2012.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.90 per
dollar, compared with 56.07 on Dec. 21, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.79 versus 56.00. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
