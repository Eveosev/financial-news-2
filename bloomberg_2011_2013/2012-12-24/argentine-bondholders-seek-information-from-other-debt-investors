Holders of defaulted Argentine bonds
asked a U.S. judge to compel another group of investors to
respond to questions about whether they are working to help
 Argentina  evade a court order requiring repayment of the
defaulted debt.  Investors in the defaulted bonds filed a request Friday in
federal court in New York asking that holders of restructured
debt be ordered to show any communications with Argentina or
plans concerning evading the earlier ruling.  U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa ordered Argentina on Feb.
23 to pay $1.3 billion owed to defaulted bondholders when it
pays about $3 billion to investors in restructured bonds, which
were issued in 2005 and 2010. The judge further ruled in
November that the country had to pay the $1.3 billion into an
escrow account by Dec. 15. That order has been stayed pending
appeal.  Restructured debt holders, which have sought to intervene
in the appeal, “do not deny that they have documents and
information responsive to the subpoenas,” said a memorandum
filed Friday by lawyers for the defaulted bond investors,
including NML Capital Ltd. and Aurelius Capital Master Ltd.  The cases are Aurelius Capital Partners LP v. Argentina 07-
cv-2715; EM Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, 03-cv-2507; U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ). The
appeal is NML Capital Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, 12-105,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
