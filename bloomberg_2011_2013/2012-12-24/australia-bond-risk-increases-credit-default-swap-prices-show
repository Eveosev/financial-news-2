The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in  Australia  from non-payment increased, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed 1 basis point to
123.5 basis points as of 11:32 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. The index has fallen 6.7 basis points this
month, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was quoted at about 111 basis points as
of 8:46 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc. The gauge closed at 110 basis points on Dec. 21,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market. The index is little changed from the end of last month.  Markets in  Japan  are closed for a national holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
