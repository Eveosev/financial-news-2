A barge with about 100,000 barrels
of crude oil headed south from the Port of  Albany  today with
part of the load originally carried by the Stena Primorsk before
it ran aground four days ago.  The double-hulled tanker breached its outer hull last week
about 10 miles south of Albany, but no oil was spilled from its
cargo of about 11.7 million gallons (279,000 barrels). The
incident postponed the first of many planned trips of North
Dakota Bakken oil from  Buckeye Partners LP (BPL)  terminals at the Port
of Albany to Irving Oil Corp.’s refinery in  Canada .  “We loaded one barge which departed this morning, and
they’re in the process of offloading to another barge,” said
Richard Hendrick, general manager of the port. “I still haven’t
heard the process, if they’re going to trans-load it to New York
Harbor, or take it right up. That’s Irving Oil’s call.”  Irving Oil spokeswoman Carolyn Van der Veen didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment today.  Buckeye said in October it reached a multi-year agreement
with Irving to provide crude services at its Albany terminal.
Buckeye has 1.8 million barrels of storage there, and is making
modifications to increase its rail capacity to 135,000 barrels a
day.  No oil spilled in the incident and no one was hurt, said
U.S. Coast Guard officials last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
