Wheat rose for a second session as
rain on  Argentina ’s coastal region and dry weather inland damage
crops, forcing some grain buyers to seek supplies from the U.S.,
the world’s biggest exporter.  Argentina’s agriculture ministry lowered its production
forecast on Dec. 20 to 10.5 million metric tons from 11.1
million last month, citing heavy coastal rains and the first
inland dust bowl in 85 years. The government said last week it
would halt exports through January because of the weather. The
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  had forecast Argentina would be
the world’s eighth-largest wheat exporter this year.  “With Argentina out of the picture, it’s going to be the
U.S. and Canada” that will be the main suppliers of high-
quality wheat, Louise Gartner, the owner of Spectrum Commodities
in Beavercreek,  Ohio , said by telephone.  Wheat futures for March delivery gained 0.2 percent to
$7.935 a bushel at 10 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price through Dec. 21 had gained 21 percent this year, after
drought reduced output in the U.S.,  Russia  and Australia.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
