A cold front brought temperatures of
minus 40 degrees Celsius (minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit) to
northern  China , as officials urged cities to conserve heating
and two tourists died after they were stranded on a mountain.  The cold was expected to continue, with Beijing forecast to
see temperatures of minus 11 degrees Celsius (12 degrees
Fahrenheit) today, the China Meteorological Administration said
on its website. Snowfall of as much as 1.5 meters (five feet)
was recorded in northern Xinjiang, the  China Daily  newspaper
reported.  A blizzard in the northwest city of Urumqi stranded 150
drivers for more than 12 hours on a highway as temperatures hit
minus 31 degrees Celsius, China Daily said. The two tourists
died after they were trapped for at least 18 hours on Lingshan
Mountain between Beijing and  Hebei Province , according to the
newspaper.  The Beijing city government on Saturday ordered government
offices, hotels and restaurants to lower heating demands so
apartments would have enough, China Daily said.  Heavy snows were forecast for parts of Xinjiang through
tonight, the China Meteorological Administration said. The
weather agency said 19 major expressways in northern China may
be affected because of the snow.  Temperatures fell to their lowest so far this winter across
China, including in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia Hubei and Guangdong
provinces, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
