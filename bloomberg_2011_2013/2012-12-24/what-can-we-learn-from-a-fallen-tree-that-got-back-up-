The little evergreen in the backyard
looks like it will make it.  Hurricane Sandy  leveled it in
October. Or rather, the neighbor’s 100-foot spruce, having been
leveled by Sandy, leveled the evergreen when it fell. (In
American suburbia, we still don’t know what sound a tree makes
when it falls in the forest; we do know that it sounds like
Armageddon when it falls in the backyard.)  After the storm, the uprooted evergreen slouched to about
40 degrees, looking like a shaggy cannon aimed at what remained
of the fence.  It all seemed woefully unfair. The tree had only recently
begun to look like a tree again. A few summers back, in another
act of tree-on-tree violence, it had been severed by a 1,700-
pound limb that fell sideways from an old oak. The evergreen
wasn’t squashed, it was halved -- leaving a stumpy, squat shrub
with a flattop. But it survived.  After Sandy, we pushed the tree upright, tying its trunk to
a fence post to keep it from listing. We pushed the roots down,
and scattered the dirt to give them something to cling to.
Almost two months on, it seems to be working. In our darkest
season, a patch of green remains.  The sage  says there will be
growth in the spring. We think so, too.  To contact the Bloomberg View editorial board:
