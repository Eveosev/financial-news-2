TCW Group Inc., the asset manager
that this year agreed to be acquired by  Carlyle Group  LP, said
Chief Global Strategist Komal Sri-Kumar will step down from that
position Jan. 1 to open his own macroeconomic-consulting firm.  Sri-Kumar, who has been at TCW since 1990, will still be a
portfolio manager for TCW and part of the team that manages
about $700 million of institutional money for the firm’s
comprehensive asset-allocation strategy, according to Peter
Viles, a spokesman for the Los Angeles-based firm. He signed a
three-year contract to remain with TCW as a portfolio manager,
Viles said today in a telephone interview.  Private-equity firm  Carlyle Group (CG)  in August agreed to buy
TCW in a deal that will give management and employees a 40
percent stake. TCW, which manages about $135 billion, was owned
for more than a decade by French bank Societe Generale SA.  Reuters reported Sri-Kumar’s move earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
