Russian (INDEXCF)  equities declined, erasing
earlier gains, as oil traded near the lowest level in almost a
week on concern U.S. lawmakers will run out of time to resolve a
budget dispute.  The 50-stock Micex Index lost 0.4 percent to 1,471.73 by
the close in Moscow, the lowest level since Dec. 17. The gauge
has added 5 percent this year. OAO  Mechel (MTLR) ,  Russia ’s largest
coking-coal producer, dropped 2.3 percent. Federal Grid Co.
declined 2.2 percent. The amount of shares traded on the gauge
was 51 percent below the 10-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The normal seasonal lull this week will be interrupted by
expected intensifying negotiations between the U.S. presidential
administration and Congress over terms to avert the consequences
of higher taxes and spending cuts scheduled for Jan. 1,”  Chris Weafer , Sberbank CIB’s chief strategist, said in an e-mailed
report.  House members and senators won’t vote on the end-of-year
budget issues until after Christmas, giving them less than a
week to reach agreement to avert the more than $600 billion of
tax increases and spending cuts. The  Congressional Budget Office 
has said that a failure to avert those changes, known as the
fiscal cliff, will probably lead to a recession in the first
half of 2013.  Rosneft Loan  Crude, Russia’s biggest export earner, slid 0.5 percent to
$88.25 a barrel in  New York , the second day of declines, near
the lowest level in almost a week.  Russia receives about half of its budget revenue from the
oil and gas industry. The country’s markets are closed for New
Year and Christmas holidays in the first week of 2013 until Jan.
8. The last day of trading this year is Dec. 28.  OAO Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer, climbed 1.1
percent to 265.09 rubles, the biggest gainer and the highest
level since April 8. The shares have added 24 percent this year.
Rosneft today said it signed two loan agreements for a total of
$16.8 billion to finance the purchase of BP Plc’s share of TNK-
BP.  The  RTS Index (RTSI$) , Russia’s dollar-denominated equity gauge,
rose 0.2 percent to 1,515.87. The  Bloomberg Russia-US stocks 
gauge dropped 1.3 percent to 97.49 on Dec. 21, the most since
Nov. 27. The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S.
exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, decreased 1.4
percent to $29.55 on that day.  The Micex trades at about 5.4 times  estimated earnings .
That compares with a multiple of 10.6 times for the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index, which has gained 14 percent.  Russian equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21 emerging markets tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
