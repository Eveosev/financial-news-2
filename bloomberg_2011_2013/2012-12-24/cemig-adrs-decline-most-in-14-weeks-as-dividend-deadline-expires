Cia. Energetica de Minas Gerais SA 
declined the most in six weeks in  New York  as the deadline
expired to receive a $769 million dividend from the Brazilian
electric utility.  Cemig’s American depositary receipts retreated 5 percent to
$12.23 at the close of trading, the steepest one-day slide since
Nov. 8. Trading volume was 134 percent of the three-month
average.  Brazil ’s stock market was closed for the Christmas
holiday.  “Brazil is closed today and tomorrow, and the stock goes
ex-dividend on the 26th, so for all practical purposes, its
already ex-dividend in the U.S.,” Gabriel Salas, an analyst at
JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York, said in a phone interview.  Ex-dividend refers to the date on which the seller of a
stock has the right to collect the dividend instead of the
buyer. Shares typically fall by the amount of the expected
payout after going ex-dividend, according to Investopedia.com.  Cemig said in a Dec. 21 filing that its board had decided
to pay an extraordinary dividend of 1.6 billion reais ($769
million), or about 1.88 reais per share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
