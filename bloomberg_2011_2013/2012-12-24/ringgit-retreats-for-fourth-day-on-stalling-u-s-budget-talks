Malaysia’s ringgit declined for a
fourth day as signs U.S. budget talks are stalling weakened
demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency dropped to a one-month low after President
 Barack Obama  on Dec. 21 called for an interim bill to prevent
tax increases for middle-income Americans while a solution is
sought to avert more than $600 billion in automatic spending
cuts and higher taxes. Malaysian exports fell for the third time
in four months in October, government data showed this month,
and the economy is officially forecast to grow 4.5 percent to
5.5 percent next year.  “There are a lot of concerns about the fiscal cliff,”
said  Nizam Idris , head of Asian fixed-income and foreign-
exchange strategy at Macquarie Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “It’s
not an exciting economic growth trajectory for Malaysia.”  The ringgit retreated 0.3 percent to 3.0729 per dollar as
of 8:46 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 3.0734, the weakest since Nov.
19, and has gained 3.1 percent this year. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange rates used
to price options, rose 11 basis points to 4.53 percent.  Government bonds were steady Dec. 21. The yield on the
3.314 percent notes due October 2017 held at 3.26 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
