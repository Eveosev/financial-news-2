LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , the second-
largest Korean electronics maker, is unveiling two new
television models based on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s software.  The Seoul-based company will introduce the televisions at
the International  Consumer Electronics Show  in  Las Vegas  next
month, the company said in a statement. The new models will
feature a redesigned remote control and improved voice
recognition-based search.  Google, operator of the world’s most popular search engine,
is trying to get more electronics makers to adopt its TV
software, which debuted to lackluster sales for initial hardware
partners  Sony Corp. (6758)  and  Logitech International SA (LOGN)  in 2010. The
software brings Google’s search and online services, such as
YouTube, to television screens with Internet connectivity. LG
said it will use Google’s software in some models alongside its
own smart TV technology.  “Wherever it makes sense, we’ll continue to look at it,”
James Fishler, vice president of marketing and sales, said in an
interview. “There are some unique features within the Google
technology that helps pair your smartphone more seamlessly to
your television.”  Google introduced a redesigned version of the service in
October. Google TV 2.0’s interface was intended to better
showcase  YouTube , and it opens up the platform for developers of
its Android operating system to build applications for TV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
