The  Seattle  Seahawks clinched a
National Football League postseason berth with a 42-13 rout of
the San Francisco 49ers, leaving two of the 12 playoff spots
undecided heading into the final week of the regular season.  The defending Super Bowl-champion New York Giants are in
danger of being among those left out of the playoffs after a
33-14 loss yesterday to the Baltimore Ravens, who claimed the
American Football Conference’s North Division title.  The loss knocked the Giants (8-7) out of contention for the
National Football Conference’s East division title, which will
be decided by the Dec. 30 matchup in Washington between the
Redskins (9-6) and Dallas Cowboys (8-7). The Redskins pushed
their winning streak to six games by holding on for a 27-20 road
win over the Philadelphia Eagles yesterday. The Cowboys lost
34-31 in overtime to the New Orleans Saints and need a Week 17
win to make the NFL playoffs.  The only chance for the Giants to make the postseason -- as
a wild-card team -- is to win their regular-season finale at
home against the Eagles and get losses from  Dallas , the
 Minnesota  Vikings and Chicago Bears. The Vikings (9-6) are at
home against the Green Bay Packers (11-4) and the Bears (9-6)
are in  Detroit  against the 4-11 Lions.  The Seahawks locked up at least a wild card spot in the NFC
last night as rookie quarterback Russell Wilson threw four
touchdown passes, including two to Doug Baldwin. The Seahawks
(10-5) remained undefeated in Seattle this season at 7-0 and
prevented the 49ers (10-4-1) from winning the NFC West division.  “We’ve had a great year so far,” Wilson said in a
televised interview. “It’s just one step. We have a lot more to
look forward to.”  Playoff Bound  The Indianapolis Colts and Cincinnati Bengals also wrapped
up playoff berths with victories yesterday. The Colts (10-5)
defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 20-13 and the Bengals (9-6) beat
Pittsburgh 13-10 to eliminate the Steelers from playoff
contention.  While the Redskins and Cowboys square off for the NFC East
title, the NFC’s final wild card spot will come down to the
Vikings, Bears, Giants or Redskins on Dec. 30. The Cowboys can
only make the playoffs with a win, while the Redskins would
still have a shot at the postseason with a loss against Dallas.  “We’re going to enjoy this win, and right after Christmas
it’s on to Dallas,” Redskins rookie running back Alfred Morris
told reporters yesterday.  Washington  will be seeking its first
NFC East title in 13 years.  Postseason Lineup  Indianapolis and Cincinnati join the Ravens, New England
Patriots, Houston Texans and Denver Broncos to complete the
playoff lineup in the AFC. The Patriots (11-4) beat the
Jacksonville Jaguars 23-16 yesterday, while the Broncos (12-3)
topped the Cleveland Browns 34-12 for their 10th straight win
and the Texans (12-3) lost to the Vikings 23-6.  The Seahawks, 49ers, Green Bay Packers and Atlanta Falcons
are assured of playoff berths in the NFC.  The NFC North-champion Packers (11-4) rolled to a 55-7 rout
of the Tennessee Titans yesterday while the Falcons (13-2) beat
the Detroit Lions 31-18 two days ago to clinch home-field
advantage up to the Super Bowl.  The 49ers gave up a season-high 42 points, including a
touchdown on a 90-yard return of a blocked field goal, yet still
can capture the NFC West title by winning their Dec. 30 season-
finale against the Arizona Cardinals (5-10). The Seahawks need a
home win against the St. Louis Rams (7-7-1) and a San Francisco
loss to take the division title.  Ravens Roll  In Baltimore,  Joe Flacco  threw two touchdown passes and
also ran for a score for the Ravens, who halted a three-game
losing streak to win the AFC North at 10-5. The Giants lost for
the fourth straight time on the road and were outgained 533-186
in total yards in losing for the fifth time in seven games.  The Redskins won in Philadelphia as rookie quarterback
Robert Griffin III threw two touchdown passes in his return from
a sprained knee, while the Vikings won in Houston even though
Adrian Peterson’s run of eight straight 100-yard rushing games
came to an end. Peterson heads into Minnesota’s season-finale
against Green Bay needing 208 yards to break Eric Dickerson’s
single-season rushing record of 2,105 set in 1984.  Minnesota’s win knocked New Orleans out of the playoff
race, even though the Saints won in Dallas on Garrett Hartley’s
20-yard field goal in overtime after blowing a 14-point fourth-
quarter lead. Jason Witten set a new single-season record for
receptions by a tight end (103) for the Cowboys, who had a
three-game winning streak snapped.  The Bears got two defensive touchdowns in a 28-13 win at
the  Arizona  Cardinals, their second victory in seven games.  11 Sacks  The New York Jets lost 27-17 to the San Diego Chargers
(6-9) as quarterback Greg McElroy was sacked 11 times -- tying
the most in franchise history -- in his first NFL start. The
Jets drop to 6-9 with their fifth home defeat this season.  In other Week 16 games between teams out of playoff
contention, it was Miami 24, Buffalo 10; St. Louis 28, Tampa Bay
13; and Carolina 17, Oakland 6.  The Bengals are headed to the postseason in consecutive
years for the first time since 1981-82 after Josh Brown kicked a
43-yard field goal with four seconds left in Pittsburgh.  Brown’s winning kick came two plays after the Bengals’
Reggie Nelson intercepted a pass from Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger near midfield with 14 seconds remaining.  The Colts, after going 2-14 last season, wrapped up a 10th
postseason spot in 11 years as Luck threw a 7-yard touchdown
pass to Reggie Wayne with 4:08 remaining in Kansas City.  The first overall pick in this year’s NFL draft, Luck
passed for 205 yards to take his season total to 4,183, beating
the NFL’s rookie record of 4,051 passing yards set by Cam Newton
of the Carolina Panthers last year.  “After the season I’ll have a chance to look back and
reflect on it,” Luck told reporters. “It’s nice. It’s nicer to
be in the playoffs but it’s nice to have a couple records.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
