A Russian prosecutor asked for the
acquittal of a prison doctor accused of failing to provide
medical care to lawyer Sergei Magnitsky before his death in
2009, RIA Novosti reported from the courtroom today.  The prosecutor, Dmitry Bokov, said that he didn’t see any
link between the lawyer’s death and the actions of the doctor,
according to the state-run news service. The verdict in the case
is expected to be delivered on Dec. 28, RIA said.  Russia  originally charged two prison doctors with
negligence over the lawyer’s death in a Moscow prison and later
dropped the charges against one of them because the statute of
limitations had run out.  Magnitsky, an attorney for London-based Hermitage Capital
Management Ltd., alleged a $230 million  tax fraud  by Russian
officials. He died at age 37 in November 2009 after being beaten
to death and denied medical care during almost a year in
pretrial detention on fabricated tax-evasion charges, according
to a Russian presidential human-rights body.  The  U.S. Congress  passed a bill this month that imposes a
visa ban and asset freeze on Russian officials it links to
Magnitsky’s death. Russia’s lower house of parliament approved a
ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children last week in
retaliation, a measure that will go to President  Vladimir Putin 
for approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
