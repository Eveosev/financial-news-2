Palm oil  climbed to the highest
level in almost four weeks on speculation that demand will gain
in China, the world’s biggest cooking oil buyer, and reduce
record inventories in  Malaysia , the top producer after Indonesia.  The contract for March delivery gained as much as 1.2
percent to 2,437 ringgit ($795) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the highest price for the most-active
contract since Nov. 27, before closing the morning session at
2,425 ringgit. Futures rose 5.9 percent last week and have
trimmed this year’s losses to 24 percent.  Palm oil  imports  increased in November to 654,232 tons from
638,217 tons in October and 629,222 tons in November 2011, data
released by  China ’s customs agency showed Dec. 21. Stockpiles in
Malaysia rose to an all-time high of 2.56 million tons last
month, the nation’s palm oil board  said  Dec. 10.  “China demand is increasing before the New Year,” Yew
Hong Han, a broker at OSK Futures & Options, said by phone today.
Investors are buying on speculation that record inventories,
which drove prices to a three-year low on Dec. 13, will decline
in Malaysia after the country said it will allow exports at zero
duty in January, he said.  The average price for calculating tax on shipments was set
at 2,147.81 ringgit a ton, the customs department said in a
notification on Dec. 17. That’s below the minimum threshold of
2,250 ringgit a ton for tax to be applied, it said.  Soybeans for March delivery gained 0.4 percent to $14.345 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil  for delivery
in March advanced 0.5 percent to 49.34 cents a pound.  Palm oil for May delivery climbed 0.2 percent to 6,868  yuan 
($1,102) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange . Soybean oil for
May advanced 0.3 percent to 8,656 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
