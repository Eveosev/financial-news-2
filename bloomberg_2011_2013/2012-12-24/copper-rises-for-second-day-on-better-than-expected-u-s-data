Copper gained for a second day in
 London  as U.S. data showed demand from the second-largest user
may improve. Nickel and tin also advanced.  Copper for delivery in three months climbed as much as 0.4
percent to $7,865 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and
was at $7,861 at 11:16 a.m. in Shanghai, rising 3.4 percent this
year. Metal for delivery in March on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange added 0.4 percent to 56,990  yuan  ($9,140) a ton.  Household purchases climbed last month as orders for long-
lasting items increased more than forecast, data from the
Commerce Department showed on Dec. 21. Purchases of new houses
probably rose to the highest level in more than two years and
the value of existing properties increased, according to the
median forecast of 60 economists surveyed by Bloomberg before
Dec. 27 figures from the Commerce Department.  “U.S. data are pointing to improving economic conditions
and that’s going to lend support,” Wang Na, an analyst at
Guolian Futures Co., said from Wuxi. “Given the holidays ahead,
copper is likely to trade between $7,600 and $7,900.”  March futures on the Comex in New York were little changed
at $3.5685 a pound. Net-long  positions , or wagers on rising
prices, held by funds were 24,531 futures and options contracts
as of Dec. 18, the highest since August 2011, and compared with
22,123 a week earlier, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
