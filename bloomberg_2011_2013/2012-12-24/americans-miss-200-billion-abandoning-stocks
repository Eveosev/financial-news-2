Americans have missed out on almost
$200 billion of  stock gains  as they drained money from the
market in the past four years, haunted by the financial crisis.  Assets in equity mutual, exchange-traded and closed-end
funds increased about 85 percent to $5.6 trillion since the  bull
market  began in March 2009, trailing the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index’s 94 percent advance, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg and Morningstar Inc. The proportion of retirement
funds in stocks fell about 0.5 percentage point, compared with
an average rise of 8.2 percentage points in rallies since 1990.  The retreat shows that even the biggest gain since 1998
failed to heal investor confidence after the financial collapse
that  wiped out  $11 trillion in U.S. equity value was followed by
record price swings in equities, a market breakdown that briefly
erased $862 billion in share value and the slowest recovery from
a recession since World War II. Individuals are withdrawing
money as political leaders struggle to avert budget cuts that
threaten to throw the economy into a new slump.  “Our biggest liability in the stock market has been the
total destruction to confidence,”  James Paulsen , the chief
investment strategist at Minneapolis-based Wells Capital
Management, which oversees about $325 billion, said in a
telephone interview. “There’s just so much evidence of this
recovery broadening.”  Weekly Gain  The  S&P 500   climbed  1.2 percent to 1,430.15 last week,
extending the 2012 gain to 14 percent, led by financial stocks
and consumer companies. The benchmark index from American equity
has risen from a low of 676.53 on March 9, 2009, though it is
still 8.8 percent below its  record high  on Oct. 9, 2007. The
gauge dropped 0.2 percent to 1,426.66 in  New York  today.  Now, much of the damage to investors is self-inflicted as
U.S. growth improves and companies whose earnings are most tied
to economic expansion reap the  biggest rewards . Of the 500
companies in the benchmark index, 481 are higher now than they
were in March 2009 or when they entered the gauge.  Expedia Inc. (EXPE) , the Bellevue, Washington-based online travel
agency, rallied 577 percent, leading consumer discretionary
companies to the biggest advance from 2009 through the third
quarter. Capital One Financial Corp. rose 39 percent this year
as the Mclean, Virginia-based lender posted profit that beat
projections by 19 percent last quarter.  PulteGroup Inc. (PHM) , the largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue,
more than  doubled  this year after the  Bloomfield Hills ,
Michigan-based company had its biggest annual earnings increase
in 2012 and the housing market rebounded.  Stock Allocation  Individuals are selling into the rally, cutting the
proportion of assets in stocks to 72 percent from 72.5 percent
in 2009, according to 401(k) and IRA mutual fund data from the
Washington-based  Investment Company Institute  compiled by
Bloomberg. The data is for all equities, bonds and hybrid funds,
and excludes money markets. Investors are lowering the
proportion of stocks they own in retirement funds during a bull
market for the first time in 20 years.  The percentage of households owning stock mutual funds has
also fallen, dropping every year since 2008 to 46.4 percent in
2011, the second-lowest since 1997, according to the latest ICI
annual mutual fund survey.  The  technology bubble  in the 1990s saw equity mutual funds
expand twice as much as the S&P 500. Stocks’ representation in
401(k) and individual retirement account funds rose to about 90
percent in 2000 from 77 percent in 1992.  Fed Policy  Money has gone to the relative safety of fixed-income
investments. Managers who specialize in corporate bonds and
Treasuries have received nearly $1 trillion in fresh cash since
March 2009, ICI data show. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s zero percent interest-rate policy and the lowest
inflation in almost 50 years have helped spur a 29 percent rally
in debt securities since Obama’s first term began, according to
the Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s U.S. Corporate and
Government Index through the third quarter.  Outflows from stocks muted gains as reduced demand kept
companies from going public or expanding through mergers and
acquisitions, according to Paul Zemsky, head of  asset allocation 
for ING Investment Management, which oversees $170 billion.  “Imagine where we could be if we had had positive
inflows,” New York-based Zemsky said in a phone interview. “It
would be very helpful to get those flows reversed and have that
money come out of bonds and into stock funds.”  IPOs, Takeovers  U.S. initial public offerings have raised about $41.2
billion this year, about 28 percent below 2007’s $57 billion,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Takeovers announcements have
totaled about $524 billion in the U.S. this year, down from $585
billion at the same point in 2011, data show.  IPOs have been most prevalent when economic growth is
strongest. Companies raised $96.8 billion through public
offerings in 2000, the most in the past 13 years, as the economy
expanded 4.1 percent. The lowest year for initial capital was
2009, when the U.S. shrank 3.1 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  While  unemployment  dropped to 7.7 percent in November, it’s
still higher than the 5.8 percent monthly average since 1948,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The housing market stagnated
until this year, and policymakers have yet to reach an agreement
on the so-called fiscal cliff of more than $600 billion in tax
raises and spending cuts automatically scheduled to hit in
January. Republican leaders canceled a vote on the budget,
sending talks deeper into turmoil last week.  Record Cash  Companies holding a record $1.03 trillion of cash on their
 balance sheets  are failing to lure individuals to investment
funds even though valuations have been stuck below the average
since 1954 for the longest stretch since  Richard Nixon  was
president and bond yields have fallen to near record lows. The
S&P 500  trades  at 14.5 times reported earnings, a 12 percent
discount to the six-decade average.  By reducing yields on fixed-income securities, Bernanke’s
has been trying to push investors into riskier assets. Companies
in the S&P 500 cut interest to the lowest level in at least a
decade, paying 2.39 percent of sales to cover borrowings in the
12 months ended Sept. 30 on average, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  “What investment options do they have? Not many,” James Butterfill, who helps oversee $64 billion as head of global
equity strategy at Coutts & Co. in  London , said in a telephone
interview. “Corporates are still very attractive, they are the
most underleveraged since the early 1990s.”  Daily Swings  Even investors who were rewarded by sticking with stocks
have had to endure record  daily price swings  and three so-called
corrections of at least 9.9 percent. In August 2011, after S&P
stripped the U.S. of its AAA credit rating, the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average (INDU)  alternated between losses and gains of 400
points or more on four consecutive days, the longest streak on
record, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Daily swings in the S&P 500 averaged 1.74 percent in 2008,
the most for any year since the Great Depression. The index rose
or fell 1.58 percent on average in 2009, the third-biggest year
on record for volatility, while 2011’s 1.24 percent average
moves made it the seventh-biggest, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Volatility is down to an average daily move of 0.59
percent so far this year, data show.  “We’ve had all of this crazy risk-on/risk-off day-to-day
fluctuation based on headline stories,”  John Carey , who helps
oversee about $200 billion at Pioneer Investments in  Boston ,
said in a phone interview. “There’s been attractive income for
stocks but certainly at the price of some volatility.”  Flash Crash  Individuals have also seen evidence that computerized
trading is making stock markets less reliable. An equity rout
temporarily sent the Dow down almost 1,000 points on May 6,
2010, causing investors to question the stability of market
mechanics and the effectiveness of regulators.  Botched IPOs for  Facebook Inc. (FB)  and Bats Global Markets Inc.
earlier this year led to concern about trading and exchange
technology, while Knight Capital Group Inc. nearly went out of
business in August after it bombarded U.S. equity exchanges with
erroneous orders in the wake of improperly installed software
that malfunctioned.  “Whether it’s the flash crash, the low-growth economy,
unemployment, uncertainty about jobs -- those things just don’t
engender any desire to risk money,” Walter “Bucky” Hellwig,
who helps manage $17 billion of assets at BB&T Wealth Management
in Birmingham,  Alabama , said in a phone interview. “Investors
say: The stock market? I don’t have a clue as to how it works
anymore.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
