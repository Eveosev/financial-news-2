Cattle futures fell for the second
time in three sessions on speculation that near-record prices
will curb demand amid signs of bigger herds than expected on
U.S. feedlots. Hogs rose.  The price of cattle has jumped 17 percent since the end of
April, reaching a record $1.345 a pound in Chicago on Dec. 19.
Wholesale beef has dropped 3.2 percent since reaching a record
$1.9938 a pound on Oct. 24, government data show. About 11.328
million head of cattle were in  feedlots  as of Dec. 1, down 6
percent from a year earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said in a Dec. 21 report. Analysts expected the herd to be down
6.5 percent.  “It’s hard to sell beef at these high prices as you get
into January and February,” Troy Vetterkind, the owner of
Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage LLC, said by telephone. Prices are
lower “because of the negativity around the cattle-on-feed
report last week,” he said. Investors probably will liquidate
positions before the end of the year, Vetterkind said.  Cattle futures for February delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$1.33275 at 9:52 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The
price through Dec. 21 rose 10 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement slid 0.1 percent
to $1.546 a pound on the CME.  Hog futures for February settlement climbed 0.2 percent to
87.1 cents a pound in  Chicago . The most-active contract through
Dec. 21 had gained 3.1 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
