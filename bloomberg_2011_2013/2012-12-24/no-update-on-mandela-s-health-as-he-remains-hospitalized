There’s no update on the health of
former South African President Nelson Mandela as he prepares to
spend Christmas in a Pretoria hospital, according to the
government.  Doctors treating Mandela for a recurring lung infection and
gallstones haven’t provided an update on his condition, Mac Maharaj, spokesman for President Jacob Zuma, said in a phone
interview today.  Mandela, 94, has been hospitalized since Dec. 8, with the
government’s last update on his health on Dec. 22 indicating he
was responding to treatment. Mandela’s condition was “serious”
when he was admitted to the hospital and he is receiving the
“best care possible,” Zuma said on Dec. 20.  Mandela became South Africa’s first black president after
the African National Congress won all-race elections in 1994
that ended apartheid. He spent 27 years in prison before that
for his opposition to white-minority rule. This is the second
time he has been hospitalized this year after undergoing
abdominal surgery in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
