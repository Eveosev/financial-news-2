European stocks  retreated for a
second straight day as volume tumbled before the Christmas
holiday and concern grew U.S. policy makers won’t meet a year-
end budget deadline.  D’Ieteren SA sank 17 percent after saying its 2012 profit
decline will be deeper than earlier projections.  British
American Tobacco Plc (BATS)  dropped 1.3 percent.  UBM Plc (UBM) , the publisher
of InformationWeek, rose 1 percent, following a gauge of media
shares higher.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  fell 0.1 percent to 280.6 at
1:40 p.m. London time following a shortened day of trading. The
volume of transactions plunged 70 percent. The gauge has still
rallied 15 percent this year as European Central Bank policy
makers agreed on an unlimited asset-purchase program and the
 Federal Reserve  announced a third round of quantitative easing.  “We are getting closer to the end of the year and, despite
the common view that Republicans and Democrats should find a way
through to avoid the fiscal cliff, no agreement is on the table
yet,” said Jean-Paul Jeckelmann, chief investment officer at
Banque Bonhote & Cie. in Neuchatel,  Switzerland , who helps
manage $1.4 billion in equities. “Markets are mostly closed so
there is little incentive to take positions.”  Exchanges in 10 of the 18 western European nations were
shut today, including Germany, Switzerland and  Italy . The other
markets closed early.  Low Volumes  The number of shares changing hands in the Stoxx 600 was 70
percent lower than the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Volumes on the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index
retreated 45 percent.  The Stoxx 600 has risen for five straight weeks, the
longest stretch of gains in four months, as investors awaited
developments in U.S. talks to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff.  Time is running out for U.S. lawmakers to agree on a budget
deal to avoid triggering more than $600 billion in tax increases
and spending cuts in January, Senator  Joseph Lieberman  said. The
odds are that Republicans and Democrats won’t be able to reach a
deal in the lower house and Senate leaders now must take charge
of resolving the stalemate, Lieberman, a retiring Connecticut
independent, said on CNN’s “ State of the Union ” program.  In  Europe , Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said he won’t
run in the country’s elections in February, though he would
consider being the candidate for a coalition backing his
economic agenda. Monti announced his resignation on Dec. 21,
paving the way for elections on Feb. 24-25.  D’Ieteren Sinks  D’Ieteren plummeted 17 percent to 30.40 euros, the biggest
drop since at least 1990. The owner of the world’s largest
vehicle-glass repair company said its 2012 profit decline will
be deeper than earlier projections and forecast an earnings drop
of at least 10 percent next year.  D’Ieteren now sees pretax profit excluding one-time items
down about 30 percent this year, compared with a Nov. 8 estimate
of a 25 percent slide.  KBC Groep NV (KBC)  downgraded the stock to hold
from buy and cut its price estimate by 26 percent to 31 euros.  British American Tobacco, Europe’s largest cigarette maker,
dropped 1.3 percent to 3,101 pence, contributing the most to the
Stoxx 600’s decline.  Gemalto NV (GTO) , the smart-chip maker that will reach its 2013
target early thanks to mobile payments, fell 2.4 percent to
68.40 euros for the biggest slump on the Stoxx 600 today.  UBM rose 1 percent to 721 pence as a gauge of media
companies posted the best performance of 19  industry groups  in
the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
