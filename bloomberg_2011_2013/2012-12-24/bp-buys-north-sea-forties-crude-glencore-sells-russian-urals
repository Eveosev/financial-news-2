BP Plc bought a cargo of  North Sea 
Forties crude at the lowest differential in three weeks.
Glencore International Plc sold a consignment of Russian Urals
blend at a bigger discount than the previous trade.  Iraq plans to reduce exports of its Kirkuk crude in January
from the Turkish port of Ceyhan to 18 cargoes, one less than
this month, a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  North Sea  Vitol Group sold Forties lot F0108 at parity to Dated Brent
to BP, a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Platts pricing window showed. That compares with a trade at a
premium of 25 cents on Dec. 21 and is the lowest since Dec. 3.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ended today at 12:30 p.m. London time due to
Christmas. It typically ends at 4:30 p.m. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days fell 34 cents to 24 cents more
than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for February settlement traded at $108.31 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $108.77 in the previous session. The March
contract was at $107.48 a discount of 83 cents to February.  Mediterranean/Urals  Statoil ASA purchased 100,000 metric tons of Urals for
loading Jan. 9 to Jan. 13 at a discount of $1.30 a barrel to
Dated Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, the Platts survey
showed. That compares with a deal on Dec. 20 at 50 cents less
than the benchmark and is the lowest since Nov. 16.  Vitol failed to sell 140,000 tons of Urals in the
Mediterranean at a discount of $1.15 to Dated Brent on a
delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy , according to the Platts
survey. That is 20 cents less than the company’s offer in the
previous session, which was also unsuccessful.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
widened 34 cents to minus 59 cents, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. In northwest Europe, the  discount  to Dated Brent
increased 4 cents to 81 cents, the data showed.  OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s largest oil producer, agreed to a
prepaid long-term crude supply accord with Glencore
International Plc and Vitol Group.  The deal is for as much as 67 million tons of crude for
five years from the start of next year, Rosneft said in a
statement posted on its website. That’s 270,000 barrels a day or
about 11 percent of the Russian producer’s current output.  West Africa  CPC Corp., a Taiwan state-run oil company, bought four
cargoes of Angolan crude, according to two traders with
knowledge of the matter.  The refiner purchased three lots of Cabinda and one Nemba
grade, the traders said, declining to be identified as the
information is confidential. Total SA, Sonangol Holdings and Eni
SpA sold the Cabinda while Phillips 66 sold the Nemba, one of
the people said. Each consignment is for 1 million barrels.  Qua Iboe blend dropped 7 cents to $2.54 a barrel more than
Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
