Iran’s President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 
visited his press adviser, Ali Akbar Javanfekr, in a Tehran
hospital following his temporary release from jail last week.  Javanfekr, who is serving a six-months prison sentence over
the publication of controversial material, is receiving
treatment for “heart problems” at the capital’s Atieh
hospital, according to reports published today in local media
including the Tehran-based  Etemaad  newspaper. Ahmadinejad
visited his aide in the hospital yesterday. Javanfekr is
scheduled to return to jail later today.  Ahmadinejad’s requests to visit his media adviser while in
detention were turned down by the head of the judiciary, leading
to an exchange of verbal diatribes between the two men. The
incident highlighted frictions in the ruling elite at a time
when international sanctions over  Iran’s nuclear program  are
taking their toll on the economy.  Javanfekr, who oversaw the official  Islamic Republic News
Agency , was imprisoned on Sept. 26 on charges of insulting
Supreme Leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  and publishing an article
questioning the history of Iran’s head-to-toe robe worn by some
women. He was cleared of this accusation last month, according
to a Nov. 19 report in the  Iranian Students News Agency , though
he will still serve time for publishing offensive material on
Islamic norms, ISNA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
