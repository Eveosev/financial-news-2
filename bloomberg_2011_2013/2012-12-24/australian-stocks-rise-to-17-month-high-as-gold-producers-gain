Most Asian  stocks  gained, led by
gold producers and Chinese banks. Trading volume was low across
the region ahead of the Christmas holiday amid speculation U.S.
lawmakers will miss a deadline on budget talks.  Alacer Gold Corp. (AQG)  led producers of the precious metal
higher. China Construction Bank Corp., the nation’s second-
largest lender, advanced 1.1 percent.  Korea Gas Corp. (036460)  slid 4.9
percent in Seoul after the world’s largest buyer of liquefied
natural gas delayed the sale of asset-back securities.  About eight stocks gained for every seven that fell on the
MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index, which rose 0.1 percent
as of 5:22 p.m. in Hong Kong. Equity markets in Japan are closed
today and markets in  Australia , Hong Kong and  Singapore  shut
early today. Time is running out for U.S. lawmakers to strike a
budget deal by year end to avoid triggering more than $600
billion in tax increases and spending cuts.  “The negotiations about how to tackle the fiscal cliff
seem to be running into a stalemate,” said Tim Leung, a
portfolio manager who helps oversee about $1.5 billion at IG
Investment Ltd. in  Hong Kong . “This makes a relatively
uncertain external environment for Asian equity markets with no
one wanting to take new positions.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index is priced in
U.S. dollars. Changes in currencies influence the value of its
constituents.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP) , which includes Japanese
shares, dropped less than 0.1 percent to 128.23 today. Asia’s
benchmark stock index has climbed about 13 percent in 2012 as

measures to support economic growth.  The gauge trades at 14.6 times estimated earnings, compared
with 13.8 on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.8 on the

talks boosted demand for the precious metal as an investment
haven. Alacer Gold surged 4.7. percent to A$4.71 and Integra
Mining Ltd. climbed 2.6 percent to 49.75 Australian cents. Zijin

market value, gained 2.4 percent to HK$3.03.  Gold prices gained 0.6 percent to $1,657.25 an ounce on

failed to get his caucus’ support for “Plan B,” which would
have extended tax cuts on incomes below $1 million, Senator
 Joseph Lieberman , a retiring Connecticut independent, told  CNN .  Korea Gas  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  dropped 0.5 percent. The gauge

saying the firm will proceed with the sale next year.  Innolux Corp. and AU Optronics Corp., Taiwan’s biggest
makers of liquid-crystal displays, slumped in Taipei trading
after the Economic Daily reported Chinese television makers will
reduce orders.  Innolux lost 6.9 percent to NT$15.55 and AU Optronics slid
6.7 percent to NT$12.50. Both companies may not return to profit
in the first quarter, the Economic Daily reported. Innolux
