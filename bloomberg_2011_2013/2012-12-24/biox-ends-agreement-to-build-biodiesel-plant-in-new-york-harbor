Biox Corp. (BX) , a Toronto-based
renewable energy company, ended an agreement with International-
Matex Tank Terminals to build a 100-million-liter biodiesel
plant in  New York  Harbor.  Biox will record a $700,000 termination charge in the first
quarter, the company said in a statement today. Biox operates a
plant in Hamilton, Ontario, that makes fuel out of seed oils,
animal fats and other sources.  “Given the significant change in the biodiesel market
dynamics since we announced the IMTT agreement in June 2012,
terminating the land-lease agreement is the responsible
decision,” Kevin Norton, chief executive officer, said in the
statement. “We also remain confident in the value of our
Hamilton production facility, especially as we anticipate the
market conditions in the U.S. biodiesel market will return to a
rational balance between supply and demand.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
