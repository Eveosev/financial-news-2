Workers at  BHP Billiton Ltd.’s (BHP) 
Escondida copper unit in  Chile  turned down a company proposal to
agree on a wage contract before terms expire next year,
threatening a stoppage at the world’s largest copper mine.  Plant workers and mine shift workers “unanimously”
rejected the proposal at meetings on Dec. 22, the union said on
its  website  today. The company can still propose a higher offer
before compulsory negotiations are triggered as the workers
contract expires in July 2013, union official Marcelo Tapia said
in an interview today.  “The proposal was bad in terms of the monthly bonus
payments,” Tapia said by telephone. “The company can still
make a new proposal.”  A failure to reach an agreement may strain world copper
supply next year as workers can legally go on strike once the
deadline for compulsory negotiations expires on July 31. BHP’s
Escondida mine accounts for about 6 percent of the world’s mined
copper supply.  The mine’s workers went on a two-week strike last year in a
protest over bonus payments and working conditions.  BHP, which owns 57.5 percent of Escondida, is planning a $4
billion expansion to boost output to about 1.3 million metric
tons by 2015, the company said. Output at Escondida may increase
by 20 percent this year after the company completed a $130
million de-bottlenecking project, Chief Executive Officer  Marius Kloppers  told analysts Oct. 25.  Rio Tinto Group holds a 30 percent stake in Escondida,
located in Chile’s Atacama Desert. The balance is held by a
Japanese consortium led by  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)   To contact the reporter on this story:
