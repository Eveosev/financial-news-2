Tim Tebow, frustrated after being
passed over as the  New York  Jets’ starting quarterback, told
coaches he didn’t want to be used in the team’s Wildcat
offensive packages before yesterday’s loss to the San Diego
Chargers, ESPN New York reports.  Tebow was active, yet didn’t play in the Jets’ 27-17 loss
at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Wide receiver
Jeremy Kerley ran the Jets’ Wildcat plays, rushing for two yards
and completing a pass for 42 yards.  Tebow was disappointed when third-string quarterback Greg
McElroy was given the chance to make his first NFL start after
Mark Sanchez was benched, ESPN New York said, citing multiple
unidentified people in the Jets’ organization.  Tebow, who was the Jets’ No. 2 quarterback for every game
in which he was healthy, told coaches early in the week that he
didn’t want to be used in the wildcat, which use run-or-pass
options to try to confuse defenses, ESPN New York said. ESPN
yesterday also reported that Tebow, who was acquired in an
offseason trade with the Denver Broncos, will probably play with
the Jacksonville Jaguars next season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
