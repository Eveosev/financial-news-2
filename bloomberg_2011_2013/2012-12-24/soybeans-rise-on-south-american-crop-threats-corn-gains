Soybeans rose for a second session
on speculation that dry weather may damage yields in  Brazil ,
while rain threatens crops in  Argentina . Corn gained.  Dry weather will evaporate soil moisture from west-central
to northeast  Brazil , increasing the risk for yield losses of
crops, World Weather Inc. said in a report today. Rain expected
over the next three days will interrupt planting in Argentina,
the forecaster said. Brazil is poised to top the U.S. as the
largest soybean producer and exporter this year, the U.S.
government said Dec. 11. Argentina is the biggest shipper of
soy-based  animal feed  and cooking oil.  “The market is starting to focus on pockets of adverse
weather,”  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for Northstar
Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone
interview. “Dryness is not serious, but could become more
widespread by early January.”  Soybean futures for March delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$14.3425 a bushel at 11:27 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
heading for the first two-day gain since Dec. 14. Most-active
futures on Dec. 20 touched $13.9775, the lowest since Nov. 20.
Through Dec. 21, the price gained 18 percent this year after dry
weather reduced output in the U.S. to a four-year low.  Corn futures for March delivery climbed 0.1 percent to
$7.025 a bushel on the CBOT, heading for the first two-day
increase since Nov. 27. On Dec. 20, the price touched $6.875,
the lowest since July 11. The most-active futures gained 8.6
percent this year through Dec. 21, as drought reduced U.S.
output for a third year.  Trading will end two hours early at noon, and U.S. markets
will be closed tomorrow for Christmas. The CBOT will open at
9:30 a.m. on Dec. 26 for grains.  Corn was the biggest U.S. crop last year, valued at $76.5
billion, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
