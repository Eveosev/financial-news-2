Gold futures declined as a stalemate
in U.S. budget talks drove commodities down. Silver and platinum
also retreated.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot index of 24 commodities
slipped as much as 0.4 percent. Time is running out for U.S.
lawmakers and President  Barack Obama  to agree on a budget deal
by year-end to avoid triggering more than $600 billion in tax
increases and spending cuts, Senator  Joseph Lieberman  said.  “There is very little time left to avert the situation,”
 Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services
LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “People are
getting increasingly worried that we may slip into recession.”  Gold futures for February delivery declined 60 cents to
settle at $1,659.50 an ounce at 12:37 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Prices slumped 2.2 percent last week, the biggest weekly
loss since November.  Holdings in gold-backed  exchange-traded products  fell 1.6
metric tons from a record to 2,630.9 tons on Dec. 21, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Gold prices are set for a 12th
consecutive annual gain as central banks from the U.S. to China
pledge more steps to spur economic growth.  Silver futures for March delivery lost 1 percent to $29.897
an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum for April
delivery slid 0.1 percent to $1,538.90 an ounce. Palladium for
March delivery rose 0.3 percent to $684.55 an ounce.  To contact the reporter for this story:
