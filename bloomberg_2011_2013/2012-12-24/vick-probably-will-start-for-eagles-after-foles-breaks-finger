Michael Vick  will probably be the
starting quarterback when the Eagles face the New York Giants on
Dec. 30, Philadelphia coach  Andy Reid  said.  Reid said he is “leaning” toward putting Vick back as the
National Football League team’s starter after Nick Foles
suffered a broken bone in his finger during yesterday’s 27-20
loss to the Washington Redskins.  “Nick will obviously not play,” Reid told reporters,
according to the team’s website. Foles’s injury was revealed
this morning after an initial X-ray during the game failed to
detect a hairline fracture on his right index finger, Reid said.  Vick, 32, hasn’t played since suffering a concussion during
a Nov. 11 loss to the  Dallas Cowboys . He returned to practice
last week. Foles, a 23-year-old rookie who played at the
University of Arizona, has been Philadelphia’s starter since
Vick was injured.  Philadelphia, at 4-11, has won one of its past 11 games and
is in last place in the NFC East division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
