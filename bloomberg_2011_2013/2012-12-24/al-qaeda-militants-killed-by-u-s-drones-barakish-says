Four suspected al-Qaeda militants
have been killed in an air strike by a U.S. drone in the city of
al-Shahir, in Yemenâ€™s eastern province of Hadramaut, according
to the Barakish news website.  Naser Qazquz, a local resident, said by phone that four
militants wearing guns were killed in the strike by rockets that
targeted three motorbikes the militants were riding in the
center of the town. Another militant was wounded in the strike,
he said.  The state-run Saba news agency also reported the strike
without saying whether it was carried out by Yemen or the U.S.  Earlier today, two al-Qaeda militants were killed in a
similar strike in the province of al-Baidha, southeast of the
capital Sanaa, the al-Sahwa website of the Islamist Islah party
reported. One of the slain militants is a former al-Qaeda
prisoner who was freed two years ago, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
