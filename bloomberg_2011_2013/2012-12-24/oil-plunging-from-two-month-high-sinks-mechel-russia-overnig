OAO Mechel (MTL)  led declines in Russian
shares traded in New York and  OAO Lukoil (LUKOY)  retreated from a four-
month high as oil, the country’s biggest export earner, sank
after U.S. budget talks stalled.  American depositary receipts of Mechel, Russia’s largest
producer of steelmaking coal, dropped 4.2 percent to $6.62 on

second-biggest oil producer, lost 2.3 percent to $65.35. The

Russian budget revenue in 2011, fell from the highest level in

Index (INDEXCF)  is trading at the lowest valuation among 21 emerging
markets tracked by Bloomberg as crude is poised for its first
annual decline since 2008.  “If the U.S. does fall off the fiscal cliff and this leads
to another recession in the U.S., this will drive down energy
demand and hurt the Russian economy,” David Riedel, the
president of New York-based Riedel Research Group Inc., wrote by
e-mail on Dec. 21. “When the political and fiscal outcome in
the largest economy in the world is uncertain, people move out
of riskier assets and specifically equities in countries like
Russia, which are seen as among the riskiest of the  emerging
markets .”  ETF Retreats  The Bloomberg Russia-US measure declined to 97.49 on Dec.
