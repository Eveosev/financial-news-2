European Union carbon permits fell
to their lowest in four sessions as volumes declined before
public holidays in the region.  Allowances for December 2013 lost 1.3 percent to 7.12 euros
($9.42) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
 London , the lowest closing price since Dec. 18. Volumes fell to
443,000 tons from a five-week high of 29 million tons in the
previous session.  To contact the reporters on this story:
