Japanese  stock   futures  rose after
incoming prime minister Shinzo Abe reiterated he will consider
revising the law governing the central bank if it fails to set a
higher inflation target next month. The remarks pushed the yen
to a 20-month low against the dollar.  American depositary receipts of  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , Japan’s
second largest carmaker by revenue, rose 2.6 percent from the
closing share price in Tokyo. Those of  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender, added 2.3 percent. ADRs of
 Sony Corp. (6758)  advanced 2.2 percent as the electronics maker is in
talks to sell its battery business to Japan’s state-backed
investment fund, according to a person with direct knowledge of
the matter.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
March closed at 10,145 in Chicago yesterday, up from 9,960 in
 Osaka , Japan on Dec. 21. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,110 in Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Japan’s markets were
closed yesterday for a public holiday.  “The yen has extended losses on the back of Abe’s
comments,” said  Toshiyuki Kanayama , a market analyst at Tokyo-
based Monex Inc. “Exporters, especially auto and high-tech
shares, are going to be bought as investors expect better
currency margins. With conditions improving, financial shares
are likely to keep playing catch-up and we will see a rally
across the board.”  Inflation Target  Abe said he will consider revising the law governing the
nation’s central bank if it fails to set an inflation target of
2 percent at its January meeting. Abe spoke on Dec. 23 on Fuji
Television. The yen touched 84.96 per dollar today, the lowest
since April 2011. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas
earnings at Japanese exporters.  Asian equity markets except for Japan, China, Taiwan,
Thailand, Vietnam and Sri Lanka are closed for a holiday today.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  dropped 0.2 percent in New
York yesterday amid concern policy makers will fail to strike a
budget compromise by year end to avoid more than $600 billion in
spending cuts and tax increases, the so-called fiscal cliff.
Lawmakers plan to return to  Washington  on Dec. 27 to resume
their negotiations.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 12 percent this year
through yesterday as U.S. and Chinese economies recovered and
central banks around the world took action to spur growth. The
Asian benchmark trades at 14.5 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.8 times for the S&P 500 and 12.7 times
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese shares declined 0.7 percent to 95.72 in New York, after
a shortened trading day yesterday for the Christmas holiday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
