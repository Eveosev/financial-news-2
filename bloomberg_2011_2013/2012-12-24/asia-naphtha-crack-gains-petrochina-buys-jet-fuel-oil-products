Asia ’s naphtha crack spread extended
gains, signaling increased profit for refiners. PetroChina Co.
bought a  jet fuel  cargo for a third day in Singapore, the
region’s largest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  The premium of Japan naphtha to London-traded Brent crude
futures rose $2.81 to $117.83 a metric ton at 1:55 p.m.
Singapore time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This
crack spread, a measure of the profit from making the
petrochemical and gasoline feedstock, widened for a third day,
the longest stretch of increases since October.  Gunvor Group Ltd. sold 50,000 barrels of 97-RON gasoline to
Vitol Group for a second day, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of traders who monitored transactions on the Platts
window. The cargo, for loading Jan. 19 to Jan. 23, traded at
$121.40 a barrel.  Middle Distillates  Hin Leong Trading Pte bought 150,000 barrels of  gasoil , or
diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur from  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  for
Jan. 8 to Jan. 12, the earliest loading period, according to the
Bloomberg survey. The transaction was at a discount of $2.10 a
barrel to January prices.  Singapore-based Hin Leong sold 110,000 barrels of  jet fuel 
to PetroChina for Jan. 10 to Jan. 14 loading, the survey showed.
The shipment changed hands at a premium of 20 cents a barrel to
January prices.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude dropped 28
cents to $20.26 a barrel at 1:55 p.m. Singapore time, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The difference,
also known as the  crack spread , shrank for the first time in
three days.  Jet fuel climbed 7 cents to a  discount  of 3 cents a barrel
to gasoil, PVM said. A negative regrade indicates it is
unprofitable to make  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil ’s  discount  to Dubai crude narrowed 44 cents to
$7.88 a barrel at 1:55 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
This crack spread narrowed for the first time in six days,
indicating reduced losses for refiners making residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade, or the  viscosity spread , was unchanged for a fifth day at
$10.25 a ton, PVM data showed. This means bunker, or marine
fuel, moved in tandem with supplies used in power stations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
