Hong Kong  stocks  climbed, with the
Hang Seng Index rising after its first weekly loss in a month,
as Chinese banks increased. Gains were tempered by declines in
exporters amid speculation that U.S. lawmakers will fail to
reach a budget deal in time to avert the so-called fiscal cliff.  China Minsheng Banking Corp., the nation’s first non-state
lender, led the country’s financial companies higher, adding 1.8
percent.  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) , Asia’s biggest
international carrier, gained 1.4 percent after planned
industrial action was called off.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of
toys and clothes to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., slid 0.7 percent as a
year-end deadline looms for U.S. lawmakers to avoid more than
$600 billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts.  The Hang Seng Index increased 0.2 percent to close at
22,541.18. Hong Kong’s market was only open for a half day ahead
of a two-day holiday for Christmas. Trading volume  on the
measure, which last week capped its first decline in five weeks,
was 16 percent lower than the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index of
mainland companies rose 0.4 percent to 11,541.18.  “There’s hardly any movement, everyone is in holiday
mode,” said Francis Lun, Hong Kong-based managing director at
Lyncean Securities Ltd., adding that any movement in Hong Kong
stocks was coming from sentiment about the mainland. “There’s
optimism that the Chinese economy will grow strongly again after
a deep slide in the third quarter.”  Peg Defense  Hong Kong’s benchmark index advanced 22 percent this year
through Dec. 21 as central banks from Europe, the U.S. and  Japan 
announced stimulus, and so-called “hot money” entered the city
amid optimism China’s economy is bottoming out. Hong Kong’s de
facto central bank injected more than $10 billion into markets
since October in defense of the city’s currency peg to the U.S.
dollar.  Shares on the measure traded at 11.8 times average
 estimated earnings  yesterday, compared with 13.8 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.8 for the Stoxx  Europe  600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong followed mainland-listed
shares higher as the Shanghai Composite Index advanced 0.5
percent.  “There’s a light news flow as the economic momentum
remains unchanged,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based fund manager
at Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285 million. “We’ve
seen a decent rally this month and buying sentiment will
probably continue after stocks consolidate around this level.”  Chinese Banks  China Minsheng gained 1.8 percent to HK$8.50.  China
Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the nation’s second-largest lender by
market value, climbed 1.1 percent to HK$6.21. Bank of
Communications Co. increased 0.4 percent to HK$5.70.  Cathay shares gained 1.4 percent to HK$14.22, the biggest
gain on the  Hang Seng Index (HSI) , after its flight attendants union
agreed on a labor deal, averting the threat of possible
industrial action over the Christmas travel period.  Futures on the S&P 500 index fell 0.5 percent today after
the gauge gained 1.2 percent last week. Fewer than two weeks
remain to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, more than $600
billion in automatic spending cuts and tax increases to take
effect in January. The Congressional Budget Office has said that
a failure to avert those changes would probably lead to a
recession in the first half of 2013.  Exporters fell in Hong Kong, with Li & Fung declining 0.7
percent to HK$13.38.  AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. (2018) , which
supplies speakers to Apple Inc., sank 1.3 percent to HK$26.60.
 Man Wah Holdings Ltd. (1999) , a sofa maker that gets about half its
sales from the U.S., dropped 0.1 percent to HK$6.59.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index gained 0.4 percent to
22,556. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  slid 5.4 percent to 15.91,
indicating traders expect a swing of 4.6 percent for the equity
benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
