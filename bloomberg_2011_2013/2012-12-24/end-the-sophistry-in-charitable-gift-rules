By all means, the U.S. should
 preserve  the federal incentive for charitable giving, but we
should make one small change. We should take the incentive out
of the tax code and, instead, send a check to those who make
gifts to eligible institutions.  We should follow the existing procedure: If you make a gift
of $100,000 and you are in the  35 percent  tax bracket, your tax
deduction is $35,000. In the future, you wouldn’t get any
deduction; instead, we the people would send you a check for
$35,000.  Under the current system, the lower your tax bracket, the
lower your  deduction . If you make a gift of $100,000 and you are
in the 15 percent tax bracket, you get a $15,000 deduction.
Under the new system, you would get a check for $15,000.  You might ask, “Where will we get the money to write these
checks?” The answer is from the same place we get the money to
pay for the deductions, the American taxpayers.  By the way, if we made this small change, the transactions
would be transparent.  Congress  would have to appropriate the
money to pay for the checks. It would be part of the budget, not
an under-the-table transaction with no accountability for
Congress and the presidential administration.  Some might observe that the current system seems somewhat
perverse, increasing the incentive for charitable gifts as your
tax bracket increases. Well, that appears to be the way we like
it. Many voices have argued to protect the charitable-giving
provision in the tax code. As far as I can tell, no minds have
been stirred to ask, “What are we doing?”  (Paul H. O’Neill Sr. was U.S. Treasury secretary from
