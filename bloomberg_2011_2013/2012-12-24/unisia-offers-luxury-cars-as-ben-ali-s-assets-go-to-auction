Assets including Italian  sports
cars , art and jewels confiscated from Tunisia’s ousted president
will be auctioned this evening, in a sale whose proceeds
authorities say will be channeled to social projects in the
country.  Roughly 12,000 items, including 22  luxury vehicles ,
hundreds of pieces of jewelery, ornate clocks, watches and
paintings belonging to Zine El Abdine Ben Ali went on public
display yesterday. The auction was to be held later this
evening, the  Finance Ministry  said in an emailed statement.  Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia in January 2011, about a month
after the start of a mass uprising against him also ignited a
wave of protests in the Arab world that led to regime changes in
 Egypt  and Libya.  Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali urged wealthy Tunisians to
step forward and make their bids, saying the money would be used
to fund social projects in the country, the state-run news
agency TAP reported Dec. 22.  Nearly two years after the start of the uprising, Tunisia’s
economy is still struggling to rebound after a drop in tourism
and foreign investment. The country has yet to approve a charter
and unrest blamed on a small yet active group of ultraorthodox
Salafis has stirred worries among secularists over the country’s
traditionally secular nature.  To contact the reporter on this story: Jihen Laghmari in Tunisia
