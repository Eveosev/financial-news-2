Herbalife Ltd. (HLF) , the maker of weight-
loss supplements whose shares have been shorted by hedge-fund
manager  Bill Ackman , hired Moelis & Co. as a strategic adviser.  Herbalife also said it hasn’t utilized the $950 million
remaining on its $1 billion share repurchase authorization
because of trading restrictions, according to a statement today.
It said it will exceed the previously announced quarterly
guidance of $50 million of the repurchase in upcoming quarters.  Ackman, head of New York hedge fund Pershing Square Capital
Management LP, said last week that a year of research convinced
him Herbalife is a pyramid scheme. The company, whose shares he
began selling short seven to eight months ago, misrepresents
sales figures, misleads distributors about potential earnings
and sells a commodity product at inflated prices, he said.  The company said last week it would hold an analyst meeting
“to respond in detail to the distorted, outdated and inaccurate
information” from Pershing Square. Herbalife, based in the
Cayman Islands, today set the meeting’s date to Jan. 10.  The shares  fell  4.4 percent to $26.06 at the close in New
York and have declined 39 percent since Dec.18, the day before
Ackman said he was shorting the stock.  Today’s statement didn’t provide further details on
Moelis’s hiring.  To contact the reporter on this story:
