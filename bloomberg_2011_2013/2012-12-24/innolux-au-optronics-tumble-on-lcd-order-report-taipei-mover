Innolux Corp. (3481)  and  AU Optronics
Corp. (2409) , Taiwan’s biggest makers of liquid-crystal displays,
slumped in Taipei trading after the Economic Daily reported
Chinese television makers will reduce orders.  Innolux, the island’s biggest LCD maker, tumbled 6.3
percent to NT$15.65 as of 10:51 a.m. while AU Optronics, the
second largest, slid 4.9 percent to NT$12.75. Taiwan’s  Taiex
Index (TWSE)  was little changed.  Order cuts from Chinese TV makers will push LCD makers to
reduce production, the Economic Daily reported. Innolux
spokesman Lin Chen-hui couldn’t be reached for comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News, while Hsiao Yawen, spokeswoman for
AU Optronics, declined to comment.  “Inventories started rising so the industry needs to cut
prices severely which will hurt profitability throughout the
supply chain,” Vincent Yu, a Taipei-based analyst at Jih Sun
Financial Holdings Co., wrote in a note today. “In  China , the
problem is with an excess of 32-inch TV panels as the market is
switching to larger sizes, and we see this order cut as being a
special one-off event.”  Both Innolux and AU Optronics are expected to post net
losses in the first quarter, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
