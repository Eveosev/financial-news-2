China ’s central bank may auction
 seven-day  reverse-repurchase contracts on Dec. 27 only this week
to avoid a conflict with the holiday schedule, according to two
traders required to bid at the auctions.  The securities’ interest will start to accrue on the
following day and they will mature on Jan. 4, said the traders,
who asked not to be identified. If the central bank issued such
securities tomorrow, redemption would coincide with a Jan. 1
holiday. Reverse repos involve short-term asset purchases that
add funds to the banking system and seven-day contracts are
typically auctioned on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  The People’s Bank of China also gauged demand for auctions
of 28-day reverse-repurchase agreements tomorrow and 14-day
contracts on Dec. 27, according to the traders. China’s
financial markets will be shut from Jan. 1 to Jan. 3. Calls to
the press office at the central bank were not answered.  -- Judy Chen . Editor:  James Regan   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
