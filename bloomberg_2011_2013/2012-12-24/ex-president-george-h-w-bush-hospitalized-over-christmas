Former President George H.W. Bush
won’t be home for Christmas, remaining in the hospital because
of a fever.  Plans to send the 88-year-old to his Houston home for the
holidays were put on hold after he developed the fever. Bush was
hospitalized Nov. 23 with bronchitis. No date has been set for
his discharge.  “We were hoping to get him out but he’s just got a few
setbacks that they think they’ve got a handle on,” said his
spokesman, Jim McGrath. “Doctors express confidence that they
have the situation under control and are cautiously optimistic
going forward.”  Bush had a lingering cough and remained in the hospital to
improve his strength. Then came some “low-energy days” and the
fever, McGrath said.  “It’s been one thing after another,” McGrath said. “He’s
just had a couple of steps backward.”  Bush is the nation’s 41st president and father of the 43rd
president, George W. Bush.  To contact the reporter on this story:
