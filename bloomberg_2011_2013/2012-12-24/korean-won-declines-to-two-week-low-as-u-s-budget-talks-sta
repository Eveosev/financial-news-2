South Korea’s won fell to its
weakest level in almost two weeks on concern time is running out
for U.S. lawmakers to agree budget revisions that will help
sustain a recovery in the world’s biggest economy. Government
bonds were little changed.  U.S. stocks fell on Dec. 21 as House Republican leaders
canceled a vote on Speaker John Boehner’s plan to allow higher
tax rates for annual income above $1 million. Senator Joseph
Lieberman said on CNN the odds are that both parties won’t be
able to reach compromise to avert more than $600 billion
combination of tax increases and spending cuts due to take
effect next year. Overseas investors bought $992.4 million more
of South Korean shares than they sold last week.  “Uncertainties surrounding U.S. budget deals have
increased, putting weakening pressure on the won,” said Cho Young Bok, a Seoul-based currency trader for Daegu Bank. “Not
many investors are willing to take aggressive bets with markets
shut tomorrow though, which will limit losses.”  The won fell 0.1 percent to 1,075.82 per dollar as of 9:58
a.m. in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 1,076.45, the weakest since Dec. 12. This year’s 7.1
percent advance is the biggest among Asia’s 11 most-traded
currencies. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in exchange rates used to price options, slid 11 basis
points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 4.79 percent today. It was
13.55 percent at the beginning of the year.  STX Offshore & Shipbuilding Co. won 764 billion won ($710
million) of orders from  Europe , a regulatory filing showed Dec.
21, while Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. said Dec. 23 it won $1
billion of orders for LNG carriers.  Reports on South Korean companies receiving dollar-based
orders and foreign investors buying local shares will curb the
won’s losses today, Hong Seok Chan, a Seoul-based currency
analyst at Daeshin Economy Research Institute, wrote in a note.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due September
2017 was steady at 3.01 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices
show. The one-year interest-rate swap was steady at 2.80
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
