Chinese police rescued 89 children
from nine child trafficking rings, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported late yesterday.  Authorities arrested 355 suspects in the operation that
included police officers from nine regions, including the
provinces of Fujian, Yunnan, Sichuan, Anhui and Guangdong,
Xinhua reported, citing the Ministry of Public Security.  Demand from couples otherwise unable to have children for
infants, particularly male kids, has made human trafficking a
“serious problem” in  China , Xinhua reported. A healthy male
infant can be sold for as much as 90,000  yuan  ($14,400) in
wealthier provinces such as Fujian and Guangdong, Xinhua
reported, citing Wang Xizhang, deputy head of the criminal
investigation division of Fujian’s public security department.  Authorities will seek to find the parents of the rescued
children by using a national DNA database established for anti-
trafficking purposes, Xinhua reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
