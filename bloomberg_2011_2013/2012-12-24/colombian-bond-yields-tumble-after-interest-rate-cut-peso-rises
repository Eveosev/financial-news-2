Colombia’s bonds rose, pushing
benchmark yields to record lows, after the central bank cut
borrowing costs last week to revive a slowing economy.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
securities due in July 2024 dropped five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 5.67 percent, the lowest level since the
securities were issued in 2009, according to the central bank.
The bond’s price climbed 0.535 centavo to 135.979 centavos per
peso.  “Not only is the market pricing in the rate cut but also
of increased chances of more to come given growth probably won’t
even reach 4 percent this year,” said Felipe Campos, the head
analyst at Alianza Valores brokerage in Bogota.  Policy makers lowered the  target lending rate  by a quarter-
percentage point to 4.25 percent on Dec. 21, matching the
forecast of 11 of 32 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Twenty-one
forecast no change. The vote wasn’t unanimous, Banco de la
Republica Governor Jose Dario Uribe said. Colombia’s growth may
be slower than 4 percent this year, policy makers said in a
statement, after expanding 5.9 percent in 2011.  The economy grew 2.1 percent in the third quarter from a
year earlier compared with 4.9 percent in the prior period, the
government reported Dec. 20. The reading was weaker than all 28
forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  Local bonds, known as TES, and the peso got a boost last
week after Congress approved a reduction in taxes on foreigners’
bond profits as Colombia seeks to lure more foreign investment
and reduce borrowing costs.  Reduced Levy  Starting in 2013, the levy will fall to 14 percent from 33
percent for foreign investors except those from countries
considered tax havens, who will be taxed at a 25 percent rate.  The peso closed little changed at 1,776.50 per U.S. dollar
today. It has rallied 9.1 percent this year, the most among
major Latin America currencies.  “While other currencies in the region are falling, the
peso is gaining as people see more foreign investors buying
TES,” said Campos, who forecasts the yield on the TES bonds due
in July 2024 will fall to 5.2 percent.  The bonds yield 1.49 percentage points more than Colombia’s
overseas peso securities, compared with a gap of 2.18 percentage
points in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
