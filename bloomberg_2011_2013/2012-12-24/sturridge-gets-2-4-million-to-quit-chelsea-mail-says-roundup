The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. newspapers with clickable Internet links.  Golden Goodbye  Chelsea will pay Daniel Sturridge 1.5 million pounds ($2.4
million) to join Liverpool in a 12 million-pound trade between
the clubs, the  Daily Mail  reported.  The Blues are adding the sweetener after Sturridge said
he’d be happy to stay with the London team until his contract
expires in 18 months, according to the Mail.  Golden Oldie  Tottenham will offer 41-year-old goalkeeper  Brad Friedel  a
new contract to stop him joining former team Blackburn, the
 Daily Mirror  reported.  Spurs coach Andre Villas-Boas wants to keep the American
veteran even though  Hugo Lloris  has become his first-choice
goalie, the Mirror said.  No Tackling  West Ham coach  Sam Allardyce  said his team won’t do full
training over Christmas to avoid more players getting injured,
the  Daily Mail  reported.  Allardyce said his squad is down to the “bare bones” and
had to field an 80 percent-fit player in a 2-1 loss against
Everton two days ago, the Mail added.  Chelsea Loanee  Romelu Lukaku, who Chelsea has loaned to West Bromwich
Albion, said he’s happy to extend his stay with the Baggies
through next season, the  Daily Express  reported.  Lukaku, 19, joined Chelsea for 18 million pounds from
Anderlecht last year, and said “I don’t think they need me
back” at the moment, the Express said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
