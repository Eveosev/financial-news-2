First Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB)  is poised for
the highest close in more than four years on bets the Abu Dhabi-
based lender’s full-year profit and dividend will exceed
expectations.  Shares of the bank, which is controlled by  Abu Dhabi ’s
ruling family, rose 1.3 percent to 11.5 dirhams, headed for the
highest level since August 2008, at 12:56 p.m. in Abu Dhabi. The
shares led a gain of 0.3 percent for the benchmark  ADX General
Index. (ADSMI)  First Gulf Bank has  rallied 49 percent  in 2012, outpacing
the 9.8 percent advance for the Abu Dhabi gauge. That makes it
the second-best performing bank on the index so far this year
after  Commercial Bank International PSC. (CBI)   First Gulf Bank will probably post the fastest loan growth
in the  United Arab Emirates  in 2013, helping boost profit, EFG-
Hermes Holding SAE said earlier this month. Net income this year
is set to grow 6 percent to 3.94 billion dirhams (1.07 billion),
according to the  average  estimate of 11 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg.  “The bank has reported excellent results and investors are
anticipating a handsome combination of cash and stock
dividends,” said Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu Dhabi-based Al
Fajer Securities. Farhat estimates 2012 profit will rise 8
percent.  First Gulf Bank will offer a 7 percent dividend yield,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimated in October, raising its price
estimate for the bank to 13.5 dirhams. That compares with a
dividend yield of 4.4 percent for the ADX Banks Index.  Sixteen analysts recommend investors buy the shares, and
one has a hold rating on the stock, according  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. The lender’s price-to-earnings ratio is 8.56 times,
compared with 7.4 times for Emirates NBD, the biggest U.A.E
bank, and 12.04 times for the Bloomberg GCC 200 Financial Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
