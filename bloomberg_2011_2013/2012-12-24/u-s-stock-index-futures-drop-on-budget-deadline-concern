U.S.  stocks  fell, after the biggest
tumble in five weeks for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, amid
concern that President  Barack Obama  and Congress will fail to
agree on a budget by the end of the year.  Seven out of 10 groups in the  S&P 500  slumped. Hewlett-
Packard Co. led losses among the biggest U.S. companies. Chevron
Corp. slid 1 percent as energy companies fell.  Research In
Motion Ltd. (RIM)  erased 2.8 percent, after the largest drop since
2008 on Dec. 21. J.C. Penney & Co. and Home Depot Inc. paced
gains with consumer discretionary stocks as shoppers made last-
minute dashes to buy gifts.  The S&P 500 retreated 0.2 percent to 1,426.66 in New York.
The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  lost 51.76 points, or 0.4
percent, to 13,139.08. New York Stock Exchange trading closed at
1 p.m. ahead of the Christmas holiday. Trading in S&P 500
companies was 38 percent below the 30-day average for that time
of day.  “The action last week in  Washington  flipped the switch for
short-term market movement from up to down,”  Frederic Dickson ,
who helps manage $32 billion as chief investment strategist at
D.A. Davidson & Co. in  Lake Oswego ,  Oregon , said in a telephone
interview. “The action picks up later in the week, when
politicians return to Washington but it’s going to take them a
couple days to figure out what to do. Today’s a wait-and-see
day.”  The S&P 500 is heading for a 0.7 percent gain this month as
Obama and Republican leaders discussed how to avoid more than
$600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts -- known as the
fiscal cliff -- that will automatically take effect at the start
of 2013. The  Congressional Budget Office  has said the changes
will probably push the  U.S. economy  into a recession. The equity
benchmark has  increased 13 percent  this year, heading toward its
biggest annual gain since 2009.  Budget Stalemate  Senator  Joseph Lieberman , a retiring  Connecticut 
independent, said yesterday that Senate leaders must take charge
of resolving the budget stalemate.  The S&P 500 slid 0.9 percent on Dec. 21 after House Speaker
 John Boehner  failed to obtain support from congressional
Republicans for his plan to allow tax rates to increase on
incomes above $1 million. Speaking on CNN’s “ State of the
Union ” program, Lieberman said, “For the first time, I feel
it’s more likely that we will go off the cliff.”  Lawmakers plan to return to Washington on Dec. 27 to resume
their negotiations. Before leaving to spend the Christmas
holiday with his family in Hawaii, Obama on Dec. 21 urged
leaders of both parties to put together an interim bill to keep
taxes from rising on middle-income Americans.  Holiday Pause  “The continued uncertainty over the fiscal cliff issue is
weighing on the market,” Dan Heckman, senior fixed-income
strategist at Minneapolis-based U.S. Bank Wealth Management,
which oversees $111 billion, said in a telephone interview.
“There’s concern corporate earnings will be a little bit weaker
in the fourth quarter than the market had anticipated. As much
as we’d like to have a holiday season rally here, I think the
market is going to pause.”  Americans have missed out on almost $200 billion of stock
gains as they withdrew money from the market over the past four
years because of the financial crisis.  Assets in equity mutual, exchange-traded and closed-end
funds have increased about 85 percent to $5.6 trillion since the
 bull market  began in March 2009, trailing the S&P 500’s 94
percent advance, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and
 Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  The proportion of retirement funds in stocks
fell about 0.5 percentage points, compared with an average
increase of 8.2 percentage points in rallies since 1990.  Biggest Declines  Energy and technology companies posted the biggest drops
out of  10 S&P 500 groups  today, falling more than 0.4 percent.
Hewlett-Packard slumped 2.3 percent, the most in the Dow, to
$14.01. Chevron lost 1 percent to $108.63.  RIM, which is set to release its BlackBerry 10 line of
smartphones early next year, sank 2.8 percent to $10.61. The
company tumbled 23 percent on Dec. 21 after Chief Executive
Officer Thorsten Heins said users who do not want enhanced
services, including advanced security, are expected to generate
“less or no service revenue.” Service fees accounted for about
$982 million in sales last quarter, out of a total of $2.73
billion.  Herbalife Ltd. dropped 4.4 percent to $26.06, following a
19 percent drop on Dec. 21. The maker of weight-loss supplements
whose shares have been shorted by hedge-fund manager  Bill Ackman 
hired Moelis & Co. as a strategic adviser.  Failed Bid  Greenbrier Cos. fell 3.1 percent to $15.64 after tumbling
22 percent in the previous two trading days as  Carl Icahn ’s
failed bid for the company and the sale of most of his shares
dragged the stock lower for a third day. Icahn disclosed on Dec.
21 that he cut his Greenbrier stake to 3.41 percent after the
Lake Oswego, Oregon-based company rejected a sweetened offer of
$22 a share from Icahn-controlled American Railcar Industries
Inc.  Consumer discretionary stocks posted among the biggest
gains out of 10 groups in the S&P 500 today, rising 0.2 percent.
Comscore said yesterday that e-commerce sales jumped 16 percent
to $38.7 billion between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21. The Reston,
Virginia-based digital research firm reported a 15 percent gain
last year. It excludes auctions and large corporate purchases.  J.C. Penney rose 1.4 percent to $19.87. Home Depot
increased the second-most in  the Dow , adding 0.4 percent to
$61.57.  To contact the reporter on this story:
