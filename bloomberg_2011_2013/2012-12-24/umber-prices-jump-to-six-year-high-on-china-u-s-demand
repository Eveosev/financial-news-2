Lumber futures jumped to the highest
in more than six years as inventories shrink on increased demand
for building supplies in  China  and a rebound in U.S. home
construction.  China will build stockpiles in 2013 after “substantial”
mill closures across  North America  in the past six years,
boosting prices for wood products, according to Scotiabank
Group. Lumber will lead commodity gains in 2013, the Toronto-
based bank said. In November, U.S. building permits, a proxy for
future construction, climbed to a four-year high, government
data showed on Dec. 19.  “China is going to go through a restocking cycle,” Jamie Greenough, a broker at Global Securities Corp. in  Vancouver ,
British Columbia, said in a telephone interview. “Inventories
are quite low in the U.S. If you need lumber, you’re getting
forced into the market to cover your requirements.”  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, lumber futures for
March delivery gained by the limit of $10, or 2.7 percent, to
settle at $384.50 per 1,000 board feet at 12:12 p.m., the
highest for a most-active contract since Jan. 12, 2006. The
price has soared 47 percent in 2012, heading for the biggest
annual increase since 1993.  U.S. Economy  U.S. consumer spending and demand for durable goods climbed
in November, indicating the economy strengthened heading into
the current impasse on tax rates and spending cuts.  Household purchases rose 0.4 percent, compared with a 0.1
percent decline in October, government data showed on Dec. 21.
Orders for durable goods jumped 0.7 percent, more than twice the
0.3 percent advance forecast by economists.  China’s housing sales in November climbed 18 percent to
595.8 billion  yuan  ($96 billion) from a month earlier, the
government said on Dec. 18. New home prices in November rose in
53 of 70 cities the government tracks, the most in 18 months.  “The big story seems to be that China is grabbing up a lot
of the production, leaving less available for the world
market,” Greenough said. “What you have is a lot of people
requiring wood and drawing from a limited supply.”  Lumber settled $10 higher on Dec. 21. This quarter, the
price has surged 38 percent  Wheat futures in Chicago have climbed 22 percent this year,
leading 24 raw materials in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index. Lumber isn’t included in the benchmark gauge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
