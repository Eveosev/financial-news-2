Gold extended losses from its worst
week in six months as U.S. budget talks stalled, boosting
concern lawmakers will fail to agree on a deal to avoid tax
increases and spending cuts.  Gold for immediate delivery lost as much as 0.3 percent to
$1,652.20 an ounce and was little changed at $1,657.30 by 12:54
p.m. in Singapore. Prices fell 2.3 percent last week, the
biggest loss since the period ended June 22. Bullion for
delivery in in February declined 0.2 percent to $1,657 an ounce
on the Comex.  House Republican leaders canceled a vote on Speaker  John
Boehner ’s plan to allow higher tax rates for annual income above
$1 million last week, sending the dollar higher versus most of
its major peers. Americans face more than $600 billion in tax
increases and spending cuts, a so-called fiscal cliff, if a deal
isn’t reached by year’s end.  “The market’s wondering which way it’s going to go,” said
 David Lennox , a resource analyst at Fat Prophets in Sydney.
“The market through last week was pricing in that it was going
to be resolved, that there would be some form of watered down
version of the legislation put into place.”  Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by gold stood
at 2,630.89 metric tons on Dec. 21, data tracked by Bloomberg
show. Holdings have climbed 12 percent this year, according to
the data. The  Dollar Index  was little changed today after
advancing 0.5 percent on Dec. 21.  Gold is up 5.9 percent this year, set for a 12th straight
annual gain, as central banks from the U.S. to  China  and  Europe 
took action to prop up economies and expanded bullion reserves.  Bets on a gold rally fell 13 percent to 112,421 contracts,
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. Bullish
silver wagers dropped to a five-week low of 30,119 contracts.  Silver for immediate delivery rose as much as 0.5 percent
to $30.1425 an ounce and traded at $30.0975. Prices dropped 7
percent last week, the worst week since December 2011, trimming
this year’s gain to 8.1 percent.  Spot platinum was little changed at $1,538.50 an ounce
after dropping as much as 0.4 percent. Prices are up 9.8 percent
this year. Palladium rose 0.4 percent to $682.50 an ounce,
taking this year’s advance to 4.2 percent.  To contact the reporter for this story:
