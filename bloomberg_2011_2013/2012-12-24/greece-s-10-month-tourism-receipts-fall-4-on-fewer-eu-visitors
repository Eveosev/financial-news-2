Greece ’s receipts from tourism were
4 percent down in the 10 months through October, as fewer people
from other European Union nations visited the country.  Tourists spent 9.77 billion euros ($12.91 billion),
compared with 10.18 billion euros in the year-earlier period,
according to an e-mailed  statement  today from the  Bank of

the other 26 EU countries down 13.4 percent and from the other
16 euro-area nations down 17.5 percent, the central bank said in
the statement.  Tourism accounts for about 16 percent of Greece’s gross
domestic product, according to the London-based  World Travel and
Tourism Council .  To contact the reporter on this story:
