Greece  should write off part of the
53 billion euros ($70 billion) of outstanding taxes owed to it 
as it will only be able to collect up to 20 percent of that 
amount, a report by the European Union and International 
Monetary Fund showed.  More focus is needed on collection from the 1,500 biggest
debtors, which make up two-thirds of the total amount owed to
the state, according to an e-mailed copy of the November report
from the Athens-based  finance ministry  today. More staff should
be allocated to auditing those cases and specific targets for
2013 should be set, it said.  Greece hasnâ€™t met five of 10 six-month targets set as part
of its tax system overhaul and stronger enforcement of value
added tax collection as well as speeding up VAT returns should
be a priority, according to the report.  The report is based on a visit to  Athens  by a technical EU
and IMF team between Oct. 16 and Oct. 22.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
