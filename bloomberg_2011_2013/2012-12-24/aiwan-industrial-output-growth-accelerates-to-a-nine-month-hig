Taiwan’s industrial output rose at
the fastest pace in nine months in November, adding to signs the
island’s economy is reviving.  Production climbed 5.85 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a revised 4.84 percent in October, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs said in Taipei today. The median of 13
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was 5.4 percent.  Taiwan left  interest rates  unchanged for a sixth straight
meeting this month as the prospect of faster economic expansion
in  China , its largest trading partner, brightens the outlook for
overseas sales. Export orders increased at the second-highest
pace in 2012 in November, and the government predicts gross
domestic product growth of more than 3 percent next year.  “Improving global tech demand led industrial production to
accelerate for another month,” Katrina Ell, an economist at
Moody’s Analytics in Sydney, said before the release. Still,
there are lingering questions over whether the technology gains
will be sustained beyond the  Christmas shopping season , she said.  The central bank held the  discount rate  on 10-day loans to
banks at 1.875 percent on Dec. 19 after inflation eased from a
four-year peak in August. The monetary authority has refrained
from adjusting borrowing costs since June 2011.  The  Taiwan dollar  was little changed at NT$29.128 against
its U.S. counterpart at the 4 p.m. close in Taipei. The
benchmark Taiex Index of stocks declined 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
