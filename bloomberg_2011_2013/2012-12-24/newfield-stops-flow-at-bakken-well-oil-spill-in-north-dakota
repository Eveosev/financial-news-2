Newfield Exploration Co. (NFX)  stopped the
flow of oil, gas and saltwater leaking from a well in the Bakken
shale formation in North Dakota yesterday afternoon, almost 48
hours after it began.  The well, in a remote part of McKenzie County, North
Dakota, began releasing hydrocarbons at about 8 p.m. local time
Dec. 21, Keith Schmidt, a spokesman for the Houston-based
company, said in a phone interview. A filing with the U.S. Coast
Guard’s National Response Center said the well was releasing 106
barrels of crude, 166,000 cubic feet of natural gas and 80
barrels of salt water per hour.  A workover rig was completing the well when the release
started, Schmidt said.  Newfield has about 100,000 net acres leased in the Bakken
play, and operates three rigs there, Schmidt said. The company’s
other operations in the field haven’t been affected by the
incident, he said.  Growing oil output in the Bakken, spurred by the increased
use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, has led a
jump in U.S. oil supply. North Dakota’s portion of the Bakken
produced less than 10,000 barrels a day in October 2006. This
October it  pumped out  682,000 barrels a day, according to the
North Dakota Industrial Commission.  U.S. oil production  increased to 6.863 million barrels a
day in the week ended Dec. 14, the highest level since January
1994, Energy Department data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
