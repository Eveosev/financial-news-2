The New York Knicks pulled out a
94-91 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves as  Carmelo Anthony 
scored 19 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter.  Anthony scored the Knicks’ final 12 points, including seven
on free throws, to rally the Knicks from a 86-82 deficit with
three minutes left at Madison Square Garden in New York.  “That was kind of an MVP performance at the end,” Knicks
coach  Mike Woodson  said at a news conference. “He stepped up.”  J.R. Smith added 19 points and seven assists for the Knicks
(20-7), who have won two of their past three National Basketball
Association games heading into tomorrow’s Christmas Day matchup
in Los Angeles against the Lakers.  Tyson Chandler  had 16 points and nine rebounds for New York
and  Raymond Felton  chipped in with 15 points. Nikola Pekovic had
21 points and 17 rebounds to lead the Timberwolves (13-12), who
were without Kevin Love because of an eye injury.  The Brooklyn Nets halted a three-game losing streak with a
95-92 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. The San Antonio Spurs
routed the Dallas Mavericks 129-91 yesterday to spoil the return
of Dirk Nowitzki, who missed the first 27 games of the season
because of a knee injury.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
