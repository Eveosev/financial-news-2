Gasoline gained in  New York  Harbor
after two units shut for maintenance at the 355,000-barrel-a-day
 Philadelphia refinery.   Philadelphia Energy Solutions shut the 331 isomerization
and 431 debutanizer units at the Girard Point section of the
plant, the largest refining complex on the U.S. East Coast, on
Dec. 17, state regulators said in an e-mail today.  The  premium  for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol in New York Harbor gained 0.12 cent to 1 cent over
futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:52 p.m. Ultra-
low-sulfur diesel advanced 1.37 cents to 7.50 cents a gallon
over heating oil futures.  California-blend gasoline rose 6.5 cents to trade at 7.5
cents a gallon over futures in  Los Angeles . The same fuel in  San
Francisco  rose 6.5 cents a gallon to a premium of 5.5 cents
above futures.  The exchange shut at 1:30 p.m. New York time today, an hour
earlier than usual. There is no floor trading tomorrow because
of the Christmas holiday and all electronic transactions will be
booked for Dec. 26 for settlement purposes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
