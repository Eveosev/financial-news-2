Gasoline futures declined as
concerns grew that American lawmakers will miss a year-end
deadline to avoid triggering spending cuts, which could damp
fuel demand.  Futures fell as much as 0.8 percent as Senator Joseph Lieberman said that time is running out for U.S. congressional
leaders and President  Barack Obama  to agree on a budget deal to
avoid more than $600 billion in automatic tax increases and
spending cuts known as the fiscal cliff.  “It’s a hangover from Friday, and from seeing Congress
depart for their Christmas holiday,”  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston, said by phone. “There’s a
growing expectation that we may not resolve the fiscal cliff
this year.”  Gasoline for January delivery fell 1.6 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.7187 a gallon at 9:06 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange.  January-delivery heating oil dipped 1.14 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $3.011 a gallon on the Nymex.  Nymex trading will end at 1:30 p.m. today, an hour earlier
than normal, before tomorrow’s Christmas holiday. Gasoline
futures volume was 77 percent below the average of the past 100
days, and heating oil was 54 percent below normal.  Regular gasoline at the pump , averaged nationwide, rose 0.1
cent to $3.247 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. It’s the
fourth increase in a row after prices fell 28 straight days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
