OAO Lukoil, the Russian oil producer
with the most assets abroad, opted against bidding to replace
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  at the West Qurna-1 field in  Iraq , said Andrei Kuzyaev, head of Lukoil Overseas.  Lukoil sees the additional risk as too great given that it
already operates the adjoining West Qurna-2 project without a
partner, Kuzyaev said in an interview posted on the website of
state television Rossiya 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
