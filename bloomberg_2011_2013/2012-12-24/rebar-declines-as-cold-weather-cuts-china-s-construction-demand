Steel reinforcement-bar futures
dropped on concern that cold weather across northern  China  will
slow construction and reduce demand for the building material.  Rebar for delivery in May fell 0.1 percent to 3,790 yuan
($608) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Futures
have lost 10 percent this year as China’s slowing economy and
real estate curbs cut steel consumption.  A cold front brought temperatures of minus 40 degrees
Celsius (minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit) to northern China, as
officials urged cities to conserve heating and two tourists died
after they were stranded on a mountain, the China Daily
newspaper reported. The cold may continue with the temperature
in Beijing plunging to minus 11 degrees Celsius today, the China
Meteorological Administration said on its website.  “The cold weather pattern is halting construction
activities,” Dang Man, an analyst at Maike Futures Co., said by
phone from Xi’an.  The  average spot price  for rebar fell 0.3 percent to 3,612
 yuan  a ton, according to Beijing Antaike Information Development
Co.  Spot iron ore  at Tianjin port lost 0.1 percent to $135.40 a
dry ton on Dec. 21, data compiled by The Steel Index Ltd showed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
