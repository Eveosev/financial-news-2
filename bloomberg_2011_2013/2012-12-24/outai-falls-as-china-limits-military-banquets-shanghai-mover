Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519) ,  China ’s biggest
liquor maker by market value, fell the most in three weeks after
authorities announced measures to rein in luxury spending by
military officials.  Moutai fell 5.4 percent to 204.88  yuan  as of 2:03 p.m. in
 Shanghai , headed for the biggest single-day drop since Dec. 3.
China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index gained  0.3 percent .  The new rules for high-ranking military officials include
bans on extravagant banquets and staying in civilian or military
hotels with luxury perks, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported on Dec 22. These regulations are part of a campaign by
China’s leaders to reduce extravagance and bureaucracy among
officials, Xinhua reported.  “Although the ban is a sweeping ban on most luxury
spending, baijiu is probably the most visible and obvious
product,” Wang Ping, a Shenzhen-based analyst at Great Wall
Securities Co., said by phone today. “This will add pressure to
the excess inventory problem already faced by baijiu makers such
as Moutai.”  The city of Beijing also banned banquets for civilian
officials visiting the Chinese capital on business and will
instead provide buffet-style meals, Xinhua said in a separate
report on Dec 22., citing the Communist Party’s Beijing
Municipal Committee.  Other liquor makers also declined.  Wuliangye Yibin Co. (000858) , the
second-largest baijiu liquor producer, fell as much as 4.7
percent in Shenzhen trading.  Sichuan Swellfun Co. (600779) , part-owned by
 Diageo Plc (DGE) , dropped as much as 3.6 percent in Shanghai.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
