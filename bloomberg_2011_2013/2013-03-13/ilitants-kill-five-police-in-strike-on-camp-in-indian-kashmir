The first major strike by militants
on a security force camp in Indian Kashmir in three years killed
five paramilitary police and wounded others.  Two guerrillas who attacked the base in Srinagar died in an
exchange of fire, Omar Abdullah, chief minister of the northern
state of  Jammu and Kashmir , told lawmakers in the local
assembly. “It was a suicide attack,” he said. Television
channels broadcast footage of police taking cover behind sandbag
bunkers and evacuating the injured.  The assault comes after  India  and  Pakistan  in January and
February engaged in their most serious skirmishes in a decade
along the de facto frontier that divides the disputed Himalayan
region. It also follows the execution in New Delhi of a Kashmiri
sentenced to death for his role in the 2001 strike on India’s
parliament.  Kashmir, divided between India and Pakistan since 1947 and
claimed in full by both, has been the cause of two wars between
the nuclear-armed neighbors. Tourists returned to Kashmir in
record numbers over the last year as violence linked to a
separatist insurgency that erupted in 1989 continued to ebb.  The two nations have repaired economic and sporting ties
since resuming peace talks snapped by the 2008 raid on Mumbai by
Pakistani guerrillas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
