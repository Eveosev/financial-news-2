Most Gulf Coast oils weakened for a
fifth consecutive day on the  spot market  as U.S. benchmark West
Texas Intermediate continued to narrow its discount against
Brent, the international crude standard.  The  spread  between WTI and Brent narrowed for a sixth day
to $16 a barrel, its smallest level in six weeks. Oils produced
offshore in the Gulf of Mexico weakened against WTI along with
Brent, since they compete with overseas imports for coastal
refinery demand.  Light Louisiana Sweet slipped 35 cents to a $19.85 a barrel
premium to WTI. Mars Blend lost 25 cents to trade at a $14.75
premium. Poseidon, Bonito Sour and Eugene Island oils also
weakened for a fifth day in a row.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet and Southern Green Canyon bucked the
trend, with HLS gaining 15 cents to a $20.50 premium and SGC
gaining 50 cents to a $13.75 premium.  In Canada, Canadian heavy oil was near unchanged at 1:55
p.m., with Western Canada Select oil losing 5 cents to a $19.75
discount to WTI, according to Calgary oil broker Net Energy Inc.  The price of Syncrude, a light oil produced from oil-sands
bitumen, lost 55 cents against WTI to a $5.95 premium, the
broker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
