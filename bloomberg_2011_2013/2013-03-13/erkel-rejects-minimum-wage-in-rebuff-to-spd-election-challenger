Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
 Germany  doesn’t need a federal minimum wage, rejecting a plank
in her main challenger’s platform for Sept. 22 elections.  In an  interview  with the Chemnitzer Freie Presse newspaper,
Merkel said she backs European Union efforts to limit
compensation in the financial industry and to let shareholders
decide on pay for corporate officers, saying “lack of
moderation” doesn’t jibe with a “free and social” country.  Merkel’s comments are a retort to Peer Steinbrueck, her
Social Democrat opponent and first-term finance minister, whose
party backed a campaign platform this week that calls for
“taming finance” and a “more just” society, including a
national minimum wage of 8.50 euros an hour ($11).  “It’s more sensible to set wage minimums that take
regional differences and specific sectors into account, not a
politically determined one-size-fits-all minimum wage,” Merkel
said, according to the interview posted on her government’s
website.  She said her Christian Democrat-led coalition is working on
giving the government powers to promote individual minimum-wage
deals between employers and workers. Merkel didn’t elaborate,
according to the transcript.  To contact the reporter on this story:
