The following is a reformatted
version of a statement released on the website of the Reserve
Bank of New Zealand, which today left its official cash rate at
a record-low 2.5 percent.  “The Reserve Bank today left the Official Cash Rate (OCR)
unchanged at 2.5 percent.  Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler said: The downside risks
around global growth have receded in recent months, and
financial market sentiment has improved.  “Domestically, the economic recovery is uneven. While demand
and output are expanding, the labour market remains weak.
Economic growth and inflation are being shaped by a range of
forces. The Canterbury rebuild is gaining momentum and
residential investment and business and  consumer confidence  are
increasing. House price inflation is increasing and the Bank
does not want to see financial stability or inflation risks
accentuated by housing demand getting too far ahead of supply.  “The overvalued New Zealand dollar is undermining profitability
in export and import competing industries, and worsening drought
conditions are creating difficulty in much of the country.
Ongoing fiscal consolidation will also act to slow overall
demand.  “We project the economy to grow at an annual rate of between 2
and 3 percent over the forecast period. Inflation is expected to
rise gradually towards the 2 percent midpoint of the target
range.  “There are both upside and downside risks to this outlook. At
this point we expect to keep the OCR unchanged through the end
of the year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
