West  Texas  Intermediate oil pared
gains after an Energy Information Administration report showed
that U.S. inventories gained last week as production rose.
Supplies at the hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, dropped to the lowest
level of the year.  WTI retreated as the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm, said supplies increased 2.62 million barrels to
384 million. The report was projected to show a 2.3 million-
barrel gain, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Crude output  rose
66,000 barrels a day to 7.16 million in the week ended March 8,
the most since 1992. The International Energy Agency cut its
2013 global demand estimate by 60,000 barrels a day to 90.6
million. The IEA said OPEC output grew 150,000 barrels a day in
February.  “An inventory build will send crude lower,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “We should test yesterday’s lows for the
front-month WTI contract.”  Crude oil for April delivery rose 50 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $93.03 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
contract traded at $93.20 before the release of the EIA report
at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington . Futures ranged from $91.60 to
$93.47 yesterday. Trading was 28 percent above the 100-day
average for the time of day.  Brent oil for April settlement dropped 14 cents to $109.51
a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
Futures touched $109.06, the lowest level since Dec. 26. April
futures expire tomorrow. Trading was 10 percent above the 100-
day average.  Narrowing Spread  The European benchmark grade traded at a $16.48 premium to
WTI. Brent’s premium slipped for a fifth day yesterday to
$17.11, the narrowest closing gap since Jan. 30.  Crude supply has increased for eight consecutive weeks.
Output has surged as the combination of horizontal drilling and
hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has unlocked supplies trapped
in shale formations in states including North Dakota, Texas and
 Oklahoma .  Crude stockpiles at Cushing, the delivery point for New
York futures, decreased 1.53 million barrels to 49.3 million.
Supplies at the hub rose to a record 51.9 million in the week
ended Jan. 11.  Refineries operated at 81 percent of capacity in the seven
days ended March 8, down 1.2 percentage points from the prior
week. Units are often idled for maintenance in February as
attention shifts away from heating oil and before gasoline
consumption rises.  Gasoline Inventories  U.S. gasoline stockpiles dropped by 3.57 million barrels to
224.3 million last week, according to the EIA. They were
forecast to decrease  1.2 million barrels , according to the
median estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The IEA today curbed estimates for global fuel consumption
in 2013, predicting demand will increase by 820,000 barrels a
day amid “elusive” economic growth.  The 12 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
countries pumped 30.49 million barrels a day in February, up
from January’s output of 30.34 million, the IEA said in its
monthly oil market report. Iraqi output rose 6 percent to 3.14
million barrels a day in February, up from 2.97 million barrels
the previous month, according to the IEA.  “Rising OPEC production is putting downward pressure on
Brent,” Armstrong said.  Brent, the benchmark for half the world’s oil, is more
sensitive to changes in Middle Eastern and North African
production because  Europe  has a greater dependence on supplies
from the region.  Indian Talks  Saudi Arabia, Iraq and  Kuwait , OPEC’s biggest producers,
are in talks to ship extra crude to  India  as the nation prepares
to halt purchases from Iran because of global sanctions, four
people with knowledge of the matter said.  Indian refiners, which are waiting for an order from the
oil ministry to stop buying Iranian cargoes, are discussing
annual term contracts with the countries for the year starting
April 1, the people said this week, asking not to be identified
because the information is confidential.  Iranian oil shipments advanced 13 percent last month even
as the U.S. implemented sanctions complicating sales from the
Persian Gulf country, the IEA said. Countries purchased 1.28
million barrels a day from  Iran  in February, compared with an
upwardly revised 1.13 million in January.  WTI may extend gains as a measure of technical momentum
increases. The moving-average convergence divergence indicator
is above its signal line today for the first time since Feb. 1,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors typically buy
contracts on a so-called bullish MACD crossover. Crude advanced
from around $88 a barrel to above $98 over six weeks from mid-
December after a similar chart pattern.  To contact the reporter on this story:
