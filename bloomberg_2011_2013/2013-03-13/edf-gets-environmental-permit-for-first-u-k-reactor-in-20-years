Electricite de France SA  won
environmental permits for its planned atomic power plant at
Hinkley Point in Somerset, which will be the first new reactor
to be built in Britain in more than two decades.  EDF obtained the three main permits required from the U.K.
Environment Agency, the company said today in a statement. They
govern control of emissions, cooling water and liquid waste
discharges from the Hinkley Point C plant, as well as safe
disposal of small amounts of low-level radioactive waste.  The world’s biggest nuclear operator is nearing an
 investment decision  on new reactors as the U.K. seeks to replace
aging plants. The French utility and the government are
negotiating how much EDF will earn for power from the new
reactors in southern  England , which are set to provide 7 percent
of the country’s electricity needs for at least 60 years.  The government must decide by March 19 whether to grant
planning permission for the project. EDF said in a report
released this month that the venture, which expects to create
25,000 new jobs during its construction, is ‘shovel ready’.  To contact the reporter on this story:
