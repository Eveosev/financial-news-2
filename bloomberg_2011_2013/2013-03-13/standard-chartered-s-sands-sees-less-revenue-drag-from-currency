Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , the U.K.
bank which earns most of its profit from Asia, said currency
depreciation in the region will be less of a drag on revenue
this year than in 2012.  The Indian rupee fell 3.5 percent last year against the
dollar, the currency in which Standard Chartered reports its
earnings. The rupee contributed “over half of the drag in
income,”  Peter Sands , chief executive officer at the London-
based lender, told reporters in Hong Kong today.  Operating income  at Standard Chartered increased 8 percent
to $19.1 billion last year, and would have grown by 10 percent
on a constant currency basis, the bank said March 5. Standard
Chartered is trying to attain revenue growth of at least 10
percent while keeping expenses under control as it hires and
adds branches in China and Africa.  “The reduction in Asian currencies’ value did actually
slow down the pace of our growth last year,” Sands said.
“We’re not expecting that to be nearly such a negative headwind
in 2013.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
