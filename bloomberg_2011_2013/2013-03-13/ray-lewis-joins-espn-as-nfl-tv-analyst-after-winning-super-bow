All-Pro linebacker  Ray Lewis , who
retired from the  National Football League  after helping the
Baltimore Ravens win the Super Bowl last month, is joining  Walt
Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN network as an NFL analyst.  Lewis, 37, is a two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year
and 12-time Pro Bowl selection who won two Super Bowl titles
with the Ravens during his 17-year career.  “I’m ready to bring the same level of passion to this next
phase of my life as I brought to the field during my years as a
player,” Lewis said in a statement.
Lewis will start with ESPN as a studio analyst on Aug. 1 and
will appear on the network’s “Monday Night Countdown,”
“Sunday Night Countdown” and “SportsCenter” programs.  His career was threatened in January 2000, when he was
involved in a post- Super Bowl  fight outside an Atlanta night
club that resulted in two people being stabbed to death.  Lewis initially was charged with murder and aggravated
assault. The charges were dropped the following June when Lewis
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of obstruction and agreed
to testify against two of his former friends, who later were
acquitted.  The NFL fined Lewis $250,000, the largest levied against a
league player at that time, though he wasn’t suspended. The next
season he led the Ravens to their first Super Bowl title.  To contact the reporter on this story:
