Trimet Aluminium AG, Germany’s
biggest producer of the lightweight metal, said it’s in
discussions with  Rio Tinto  Group to buy two smelters in  France .  “We are in talks,” Martin Iffert, chief executive officer
of Trimet, said by phone, declining to give further details. An
official for Rio in London declined to comment.  Rio has been seeking to sell at least 13 aluminum assets
since 2011 when it grouped the operations in its Pacific
Aluminium unit in preparation for a possible disposal. The Rio-
Trimet talks started yesterday, Industry Minister  Arnaud Montebourg  told the French National Assembly.  “We were worried that Rio Tinto, having announced its
plans to exit the business, would simply shut the plants and
move production abroad,” he said. “I’m fortunate to be able to
tell you that, since yesterday, Rio Tinto is in exclusive talks
with Trimet for the takeover of the site at Castelsarrasin, but
also for the one at Saint-Jean de Maurienne.”  Reuters reported Montebourg’s comments earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
