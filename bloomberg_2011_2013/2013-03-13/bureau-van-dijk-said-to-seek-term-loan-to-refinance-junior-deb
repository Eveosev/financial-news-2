Bureau van Dijk Electronic
Publishing BV, owned by Charterhouse Capital Partners LLP, is
seeking to replace its 140 million-euro ($181 million) mezzanine
debt with a senior loan, according to three people with
knowledge of the matter.  ING Groep NV and Nomura Holdings Inc. are coordinating the
deal, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
the matter is private.  The term loan C will be as much as 140 million euros and
can be in dollars, euros and pounds, one of the people said. The
debt will be offered to lenders paying an interest margin of 475
basis points more than benchmark rates for euros and dollars,
and 25 basis points more for the portion in pounds, the person
said.  More than two thirds of existing lenders to the company
must agree to the new debt structure and have been offered fees
of 25 basis points if they commit by March 20, said the person.
Lenders responding by the final deadline of March 25 will
receive 8 basis points, they said. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Gary Sunderland, head of information resources at London-
based Charterhouse, declined to comment on the financing.
Officials at Bureau van Dijk didnâ€™t immediately respond to a
telephone call seeking a comment on the deal.  Charterhouse bought Brussels-based Bureau van Dijk in 2011
backed by 505 million euros of debt, including 365 million euros
of senior loans and 140 million euros of mezzanine debt maturing
in 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
