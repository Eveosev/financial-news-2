Bilfinger SE Chief Executive
Officer  Roland Koch  earned 2.3 million euros ($3 million) in his
first full year heading Germany’s second-largest construction
company.  The former prime minister of the state of Hesse earned a
basic salary of 768,000 euros, while his total pay rose 42
percent from 2011, the Mannheim, Germany-based company said in
its annual report. Koch became CEO on July 1, 2011.  Bilfinger is predicting an increase in 2013 profit helped
by a savings program and rising demand for engineering work and
services in the power industry. The 133-year-old company is
planning to fuel its growth with acquisitions, and Koch said in
January he has 850 million euros available for such deals.  Koch, born in Frankfurt in 1958, served as prime minister
of Hesse for 11 years until 2010 as a member of  Angela Merkel ’s
 Christian Democratic Union . Frankfurt is the largest city in the
federal state.  Bilfinger’s shares gained 11 percent under Koch’s
leadership in 2012 and they have risen 11 percent this year,
valuing it at 3.7 billion euros. Competitor  Hochtief AG (HOT)  lost 1.7
percent last year.  Bilfinger today reiterated a target of achieving at least
11 billion euros in output and net income of 400 million euros
in 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
