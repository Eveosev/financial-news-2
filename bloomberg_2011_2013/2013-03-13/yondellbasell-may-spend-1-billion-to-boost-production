LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB) , the
largest producer of polypropylene, may spend as much as $1
billion through 2016 to boost output of chemicals and plastics
to take better advantage of low-cost U.S. natural gas.  New projects costing $900 million to $1 billion will
increase annual pretax earnings by $500 million to $600 million,
the Rotterdam-based company said today in a webcast  presentation 
from New York. The projects are in addition to previously
announced expansions that will add as much as $1 billion to
earnings by 2016.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jim Gallogly is
expanding existing facilities rather than building new factories
to more rapidly take advantage of inexpensive gas. The strategy
also cuts the cost of new ethylene capacity to 50 cents,
compared with 75 cents to 80 cents for new plants pursued by
competitors, Gallogly said in the webcast.  The biggest new investment would expand ethylene production
in Corpus Christi,  Texas , by 800 million pounds (362 million
kilograms) a year at a cost of $420 million, according to a
slide presentation on the companyâ€™s website. An expansion at
Channelview, Texas, would add 250 million pounds of ethylene
capacity for $170 million.  Ethylene is the most common petrochemical and is used to
make plastics such as polyethylene, found in garbage bags and
packaging. Both projects would be completed in 2015.  The company also is considering adding 1.22 billion pounds
of polyethylene, including the possibility of adding a new
production line.  To contact the reporter on this story:
