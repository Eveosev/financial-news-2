The New York Giants signed kicker
Josh Brown, signaling the end of  Lawrence Tynes ’s stay with the
team after six years and two Super Bowl titles, according to the
Star-Ledger of Newark, New Jersey.  Brown, 33, appeared in four games for the Cincinnati
Bengals last year after an injury to Mike Nugent and made 11 of
12 field goal attempts. He was beaten out by  Nick Folk  for the
New York Jets’ kicking job before the season.  Brown spent his first five National Football League seasons
with the Seattle Seahawks and then played four years in  St.
Louis  before getting cut when the Rams drafted Greg Zuerlein.
He’s made 231 of 284 field-goal attempts for a 81.3 percent
success rate.  Tynes, 34, is an unrestricted free agent and the addition
of Brown makes it unlikely the Giants will re-sign him, the
newspaper said. Tynes has made 81.5 percent of his kicks over a
nine-year NFL career, including 83.6 percent in six seasons with
the Giants. He sent the Giants to two Super Bowls by making
overtime field goals that won National Football Conference
championship games following the 2007 and 2011 seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
