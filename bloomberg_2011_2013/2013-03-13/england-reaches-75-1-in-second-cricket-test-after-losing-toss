England  reached 75-1 at lunch on
day one of the second cricket Test against New Zealand in
Wellington after being put in to bat.  Neil Wagner had England captain Alastair Cook caught for 17
in the morning session before Nick Compton (34 not out) and
Jonathan Trott (23) batted through until the interval without
further loss.  Both teams are unchanged from the rain-affected series-
opener in Dunedin, which finished in a draw as England fought
back after being dismissed for 167 in its first innings.  New Zealand, which has lost eight of its past 12 elite
five-day matches, last won a Test series against England 14
years ago. The third and final Test starts March 22.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
