Nike Inc. (NKE)  today agreed a 10-year
contract to be the official apparel and equipment sponsor of
Italian soccer team AS Roma.  The accord will begin at the start of the 2014-15 season,
the companies said in an e-mailed statement. The team’s current
technical sponsor is  BasicNet SpA (BAN) ’s Kappa brand.  “AS Roma is committed to becoming the premier football
club in the world, on and off the field,” said Italo Zanzi,
Roma’s chief executive officer. “This partnership is a
fundamental step in that mission.”  Roma was bought by a group of American investors led by
hedge fund manager James Pallotta in 2011. It won the last of
its three league championships in 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
