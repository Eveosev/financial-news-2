Federal spending cuts this year
will mean job losses and lower  tax revenue  while reduced aid
will put pressure on budgets in many states that may lead to tax
increases or service rollbacks, according to  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)   “Federal fiscal austerity will constrain state
governments, but financial flexibility remains,” analysts led
by  Peter Hayes , head of municipal bonds at the world’s biggest
asset manager, said today in a report. New York-based BlackRock
manages $109 billion of the securities.  On top of $85 billion in spending cuts under the budget
sequestration that began March 1, future steps to curb the
federal deficit may put fiscal pressures on states, the analysts
said. While the jointly funded Medicaid program for the poor was
exempt this year, it may become a target, forcing states to
raise taxes and fees, divert money from other services, delay
funding for pensions and use reserves, they said.  Virginia, Maryland and  Hawaii  are the three states with the
greatest reliance on federal spending, and cuts to jobs, defense
contracts and direct aid could have “adverse effects” on their
economies, according to the report. While it remains a threat to
the $3.7 trillion municipal-securities market, the analysts said
the elimination of tax-exemptions for state and local general-
obligation debt is “highly unlikely.”  State debt is lagging behind the broader market, with a
total return of 0.27 percent this year compared with 0.41
percent for all munis, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
