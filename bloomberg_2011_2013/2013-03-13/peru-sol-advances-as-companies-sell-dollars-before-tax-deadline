Peru ’s sol appreciated as companies
exchanged dollars for the local currency to pay taxes and after
a report that showing better-than-forecast U.S. retail sales
bolstered demand for higher-yielding assets.  The sol rose 0.1 percent to 2.5927 per  U.S. dollar  at 12:04
p.m. in  Lima , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has
fallen 1.6 percent this year, after a 5.4 percent gain in 2012.  Peruvian companies have until March 21 to make monthly tax
payments, and until early April to meet their obligations for
the 2012 tax year, according to the tax-collection agency’s
website. Sales at retailers in the U.S., the Andean nation’s
biggest export market, climbed twice as much as forecast in
February, according to Commerce Department figures.  “This month there’s going to be a stronger demand for
soles to pay taxes,” said Hedmond Rios, an economist at Celfin
Capital in Santiago. “There’s greater appetite for higher-
yielding assets in  emerging markets ” on signs the U.S. recovery
remains intact, he said.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol bond due
August 2020 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
3.84 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price
fell 0.06 centimo to 125.47 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
