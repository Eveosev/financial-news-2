Oltchim SA (OLT) ,  Romania ’s state-owned
insolvent chemical company, may be split in two to pay off its
debt and attract interest before a majority stake is sold to
meet pledges under an international loan accord.  Oltchim’s viable assets may be transferred to a special-
purpose vehicle and the remainder may be liquidated to help pay
off part of debts totaling about 800 million euros ($1 billion)
under a reorganization plan, legal administrator  Gheorghe
Piperea  told reporters in Bucharest today.  “The company is now operational to ensure its survival and
give us time to prepare its reorganization, which in turn is
only meant to prepare its privatization,” Piperea said.  The Romanian government, which failed to sell Oltchim last
year to politician Dan Diaconescu, should try to sell its
majority in the company to a strategic investor from the
chemical or petrochemical industry, Piperea said. The
administration pledged to sell it part of a precautionary accord
with the  International Monetary Fund  and the European Union to
unburden the state budget.  The company’s reorganization plan will be completed after
the creditors’ meeting in mid-April, Economy Minister Varujan Vosganian told reporters today at the joint conference with
Oltchim’s legal administrators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
