Wheat shipments from Australia, the
world’s third-biggest exporter this year, will probably advance
13 percent in 2013-2014 as higher profits encourage farmers to
boost planting, CBH Group said.  Sales may rise to as high as 18 million metric tons in the
year beginning November from 16 million tons this year, said Tom
Puddy, head of marketing at the country’s largest grain handler,
which ships about 6 million tons of wheat a year. Production
will expand to 24 million tons from 21.5 million tons, he said.  Rising supplies from Australia may intensify competition
among shippers, with the  United Nations  predicting world output
in 2013 to be the second-highest on record, boosted by a
recovery in yields in parts of  Europe  including Russia. Snow is
boosting the harvest outlook in the U.S., while exports from
 India  will surge to a record after government approved more
shipments. Wheat, down this year, was the best performer on the
Standard and Poor’s GSCI index of 24 commodities in 2012.  “Farmers are looking at the relative value globally,”
Puddy said in an interview in Singapore yesterday. “Wheat
prices came off over the past month, but the farmers’ returns
are still reasonable.”  Futures traded at $7.0425 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade at 5:38 p.m.  Singapore  time, down 26 percent from a four-
year high in July. Prices climbed 19 percent in 2012, when
drought from the U.S. to Europe cut supplies.  Aggressive Sales  “Russia will be aggressive to regain market share in the
second half of the year,” Puddy said. “We’re seeing some
discounted values after June,” he said, referring to export
prices, reflecting market expectations of increasing supply.  The Australian government has forecast exports to drop to
20.8 million tons in the year beginning July from 21.9 million
tons, as less grain will be drawn from stockpiles. The nation’s
fiscal year starts July 1 and wheat planting from about April.  Puddy uses the marketing year that begins when the initial
harvests are ready for export. Total supply will be little
changed at 28 million tons in 2013-2014, including a stockpile
of 4 million tons carried over from the previous harvest and
output of 24 million tons, he said.  Farmers in  Australia  may boost plantings by 3.8 percent to
13.8 million hectares (34.1 million acres), the Australian
Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences said
March 5. The country is the largest shipper after the U.S. and
the European Union, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  “Export expansion from Australia is a bearish factor for
wheat in the medium and long term,” Makiko Tsugata, an analyst
at Market Risk Advisory Co., said in an e-mail today.  World output may total 690 million tons in the 2013 growing
season, compared with 661.8 million tons in 2012, the UN’s Food
& Agriculture Organization  said  March 7. The harvest would be
second only to the 2011 record.  Russia  may produce 53 million tons, up 39 percent from 2012,
the FAO said. Exports from India may reach 10 million tons in
the year from April 1, according to the New Delhi-based National
Centre for Agricultural Economics and Policy Research.  To contact the reporter on this story:
