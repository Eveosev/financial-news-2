Treasuries fell, pushing 10-year
yields toward an 11-month high, after sales at U.S. retailers
increased in February by the most in five months, fueling
investor appetite for higher-yielding assets.  The rise in  yields  may help bolster demand at today’s
government auction of $21 billion of 10-year notes. The
benchmark notes are the highest in demand, or on “special” in
the repurchase-agreement, or repo, market, where firms borrow
and lend securities. Traders were willing to pay to borrow the
securities in exchange for loaning cash.  Treasury yields dropped yesterday for the first time in
seven days after climbing last week as stronger-than-forecast
U.S. economic data damped demand for the refuge of bonds.  “The number on retail sales looks pretty good,” said
Larry Milstein, managing director in New York of government-debt
trading a R.W. Pressprich & Co. “The numbers came in pretty
solid. We’re softer on Treasuries as you would expect, but we
remain in this band.”  Ten-year  yields  rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 2.04 percent at 12:04 p.m.  New York  time, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader data, after falling earlier to 2 percent.
They increased to 2.08 percent on March 8, the highest level
since April 5. The price of the 2 percent security maturing in
February 2023 declined 7/32, or $2.19 per $1,000 face amount, to
99 5/8.  The yield on the 10-year note needs to test 2.1 percent
before investors look toward consistently higher levels,
Milstein said.  Repo Rate  Today’s auction, a reopening of the February 10-year note
sale, is the second of three note and bond offerings this week
totaling $66 billion.  The current 10-year note closed today at the lowest repo
rate, negative 2.95 percent. Traders often short, or sell
securities they’ve borrowed in the repo market, before a
Treasury sale to profit if prices of the securities fall after
the auction.  “Before the reopenings, you tend to see the 10-year trade
pretty special in repo markets,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest-
rate strategist at BNP Paribas SA in New York, which as one of
the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers is required to bid at
U.S. debt auctions. “What happens is that people are buying up
a lot of the 10-year, and then those who want to short it or
sell it are having difficulty borrowing it.”  The 10-year notes being sold today yielded 2.045 percent in
pre-auction trading. At the last offering of the debt on Feb.
13, which drew a yield of 2.046 percent, investors submitted
 bids  for 2.68 times the amount of debt available, versus an
average of 2.92 at the previous 10 sales.  The government is scheduled to sell $13 billion of 30-year
bonds tomorrow.  ‘Hard Time’  “The  bond market  will have a hard time going up” in
price, said  Charles Comiskey , head of Treasury trading at the
primary dealer Bank of  Nova Scotia  in New York. “The last
couple of economic data we got have been better.”  Ten-year yields climbed the most in almost a year last week
as data showed American companies added 236,000 more jobs in
January versus the 165,000 forecast by economists.  Retail sales rose 1.1 percent, more than forecast,
following a revised 0.2 percent gain in January, Commerce
Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for a 0.5 percent advance.
Sales excluding automobiles and gasoline climbed 0.4 percent,
versus a forecast for a gain of 0.2 percent.  Stronger Demand  Treasuries advanced yesterday amid stronger-than-forecast
demand at a $32 billion auction of three-year notes. The
securities  yielded  0.411 percent, below the average forecast of
0.413 percent in a Bloomberg News poll of seven primary dealers.  Treasuries have lost 1 percent this year, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch indexes. German  government securities 
have declined 0.7 percent, the indexes show.  Treasury securities due in a decade and more are trading at
almost the cheapest level since 2011 relative to global peers
with similar maturities, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes
show. Yields on the Treasuries were 54 basis points higher on
March 8 than those in an index of other sovereign debt due in 10
years and more, based on the data. It was the most since August
2011. The spread was 52 basis points yesterday.  Yields will decline to 1.86 percent by March 31 and rise to
2.31 percent by year-end, according to the weighted average
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Volatility Fell  Volatility as measured by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
MOVE index dropped yesterday to 53.7 basis points, the lowest
since Jan. 23. The gauge, which tracks the outlook for swings in
U.S. government debt rates, has averaged 66.2 basis points over
the past year.  The Fed purchased $1.46 billion today in Treasuries due
from February 2036 to February 2043. The U.S. central bank has
been buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage bonds each
month under the quantitative-easing stimulus strategy since the
start of the year. The effort is designed to try to hold down
borrowing costs and encourage economic growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
