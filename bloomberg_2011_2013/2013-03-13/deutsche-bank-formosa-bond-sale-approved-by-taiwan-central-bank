Deutsche Bank AG, Germany’s largest lender, won approval from Taiwan’s central bank to sell $1 billion of foreign-currency bonds on the island.  The monetary authority will also allow the lender to sell yuan-denominated debt. Deutsche Bank also needs approval from Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission and will apply to the regulator today, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the details are private.  Deutsche Bank plans to sell as much as 2 billion  yuan  ($322 million) of five-year and three-year debt in Taiwan, another person familiar with the matter said on March 4. The lender raised 1.75 billion euros ($2.28 billion) in January from a sale of 2.375 percent debt due in 10 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has almost 19 billion euros of bonds still to mature this year, the data shows.  The planned yuan sale follows Chinatrust Commercial Bank’s issuance in the Chinese currency last month in what the government said was the debut sale of Formosa bonds. The securities, which started trading yesterday, were little changed at 2.9 percent as of 12:38 p.m. in Taipei.  Deutsche Bank plans to sell five-year bonds at a yield of 1.6 percent to 2.7 percent and three-year debt at 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent, the other person said. Candice Sun, a Hong Kong- based spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, declined to comment in an emailed reply.
