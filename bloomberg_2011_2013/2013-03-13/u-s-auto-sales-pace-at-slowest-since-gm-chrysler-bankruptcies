Sales of new cars and trucks in the
U.S. have cooled to the slowest pace in more than three years
even as automakers increase spending on incentives.  The average number of days needed to sell new vehicles rose
to 64 at the end of February, the most since August 2009,
Bloomberg Industries said in a report today. Carmakers have also
raised incentives to 7.8 percent of a vehicle’s price to lure
buyers, the highest ratio since 2011, analyst  Kevin Tynan  wrote
in the note. Incentives increased more than 8 percent in both
January and February, he said.  Vehicle sales have remained a bright spot for the U.S.,
expanding more than 10 percent annually since 2010, the year
after bankruptcies for the former  General Motors Corp. (GM)  and
Chrysler LLC. Growth is slowing this year, with total light-
vehicle sales rising 3.7 percent in February, according to
Autodata Corp.  Still, it’s premature to be concerned as the pace of growth
is returning to pre-recession levels, said Jessica Caldwell,
industry analyst for Edmunds.com.  “Even though it’s creeping up a bit, it doesn’t start to
raise eyebrows at this point,” she said. “The number of days
needed for a sale have risen, but it’s stabilized in the low
60s.”  Brands seeing some of the biggest increases in average
numbers of days needed to sell their vehicles include Chrysler,
GM’s Chevrolet and GMC brands and  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s Lincoln line,
said Caldwell, who’s based in  Santa Monica ,  California .  To contact the reporter on this story:
