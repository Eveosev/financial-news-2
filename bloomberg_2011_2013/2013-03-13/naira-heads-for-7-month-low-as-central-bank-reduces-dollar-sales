Nigeria’s naira depreciated for a
fourth day, heading for its lowest in more than seven months as
the central bank reduced the amount of dollars it sold in
auctions this week.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer retreated 0.3
percent to 158.85 per dollar as of 2:35 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, its weakest level on a closing basis since
Aug. 8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lenders bought the entire $180 million offered today, the
Abuja-based Central Bank of Nigeria said in an e-mailed
statement. The regulator sold $360 million at its two auctions
this week, compared with $384 million last week. Oil companies,
which sell dollars around the month-end to meet domestic
expenses, are the main supplier of the U.S. currency after the
central bank.  “Oil company sales have dried as we enter the mid-month,
prompting banks to seek more dollars from the central bank,”
Tunde Ladipo, chief executive officer of Lagos-based Valuechain
Investment Ltd., said by phone. “The interbank market requires
more than was supplied today to meet customers’ demand.”  Borrowing costs on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic
bonds due January 2022 declined 11 basis points to 11.03
percent, according to yesterday’s data compiled on the  Financial
Markets Dealers Association  website. Yields on the nation’s $500
million of Eurobonds due January 2021 fell nine basis points to
4.126 percent.  Ghana ’s cedi declined for a second day, sliding 0.1 percent
to 1.9245 per dollar in Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
