SandRidge Energy Inc. (SD)  will add four
directors named by TPG-Axon Capital Management LP and agreed to
give the activist shareholder control of the board if  Tom Ward 
is still running the company in four months.  The board is slashing director pay by a third to $250,000 a
year from $375,000, Oklahoma City-based SandRidge said in a
statement yesterday. President and Chief Operating Officer
Matthew Grubb is resigning after seven years at the oil and
natural gas producer, the company said.  TPG-Axon, which owns 7.33 percent of SandRidge shares,
blamed the seven-member board and Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Ward for “strategic blunders, extraordinary spending
and poor governance” that caused the stock to drop. SandRidge
has  fallen  78 percent since it began selling for $26 a share in
2007.  The settlement with TPG-Axon, led by former Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. banker  Dinakar Singh , is another successful
shareholder action in a series of campaigns that have shaken up
the industry in the past year.  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  co-
founder  Aubrey McClendon  submitted his resignation after
investors pushed for changes.  Murphy Oil Corp. (MUR)  and  Hess Corp. (HES) 
have also been subject to shareholder criticism.  “We believe these actions open a new chapter for
SandRidge,” board member Jeffrey Serota said in the statement.  Reviewing Transactions  TPG-Axon has questioned land transactions between SandRidge
and companies associated with Ward or his family members, and
pushed for a new CEO and board. After an initial review absolved
Ward of wrongdoing, SandRidge said yesterday the board is
completing an independent review of the related-party
transactions questioned by TPG-Axon. The results of that audit
are expected by June 15.  TPG-Axon nominees Stephen C. Beasley, Edward W. Moneypenny,
Alan J. Weber and Dan A. Westbrook are being added to the board
immediately. The agreement gives the board until June 30 to
decide whether to fire Ward, who founded the company in 2006. If
he isn’t terminated, three existing board members will exit and
an additional director will be named by TPG-Axon, giving the
activist shareholder a majority.  Ward’s employment agreement gives him as much as $97.4
million if he’s fired because of a change of control on the
board. The four new members being added to the board now don’t
qualify as a change in control, Greg Dewey, a SandRidge
spokesman, said in an e-mail.  Payout Trigger  TPG-Axon may be gambling that the investigation will turn
up enough information to fire Ward for cause, avoiding the need
to make a big payout, said Jason Wangler, an analyst with
Wunderlich Securities Inc. in Houston.  “They’re certainly feeling comfortable that they can move
him out without having to pay him that money,” Wangler said in
an interview. Wangler has a hold rating on SandRidge and doesn’t
own any of the stock.  Ward, 53, wasn’t available to comment on the settlement,
according to Dewey. Singh declined to comment.  The company elevated Chief Financial Officer James Bennett
to president, and said he will serve as interim CEO if Ward
leaves and until the board finds a successor. Serota would
become interim chairman for six months after Ward’s departure.  Investors already persuaded a Delaware judge to bar
SandRidge from using provisions in its debt agreements to coerce
shareholders in the proxy fight. The covenants for $4.3 billion
of SandRidge’s debt allow for accelerated payment if there’s a
change in control on the board.  SandRidge Injunction  Delaware Chancery Court Judge Leo Strine sided Friday with
shareholders who said that SandRidge’s board could have disabled
those provisions. Its refusal to do so “is redolent more of the
pursuit of an incremental advantage in a close contest,” Strine
said in a ruling that granted an injunction against SandRidge.  “We are pleased that there is a resolution that we hope
will lead to enhanced  shareholder value  in this company,”
 Stuart Grant , a lawyer for the SandRidge investors, said in a
telephone interview yesterday.  SandRidge’s board will “conduct a comprehensive review of
the company’s strategy and costs,” the company said in its
statement yesterday. TPG-Axon had pressed SandRidge to reduce
debt and sell assets, including as much as half of SandRidge’s
undeveloped acreage in the Mississippian Lime, an oil and gas
area in Oklahoma and  Kansas .  SandRidge fell 2.4 percent to $5.71 at the close in  New
York .  Increase Value  The company’s options to increase its value are limited,
Amir Arif, a Washington-based analyst with Stifel Nicolaus &
Co., wrote in a note to clients. While SandRidge’s overhead
costs are high, they only account for 11 percent of its
expenses.  The board may be “hamstrung” by lower output in the
Mississippian, Sandridge’s core oil field, Arif wrote. SandRidge
said March 1 that oil accounted for 29 percent of its production
in the field, down from a November estimate of 35 percent. The
remaining output was gas and petroleum liquids, which are less
valuable.  “The only new approach we see is reduced capex,” Arif
wrote. That approach would lower the value of Sandridge’s assets
by reducing production.  SandRidge had said the New York-based fund was running a
“false and misleading campaign” to take control of the company
without paying a premium. SandRidge has moved away from gas
production in favor of higher-priced oil and is in the best
financial position in its six-year history, Ward said at a March
5 analyst meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
