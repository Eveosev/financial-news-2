U.K. farm management company
Velcourt Group said it’s planning to invest in farmland in
 Romania  in a joint venture with Mintridge International.  The investment, managed through a Bucharest-based company
called Velcourt SRL, involves “multiple projects” valued at 14
million euros ($18.26 million) to 20 million euros each,
Velcourt said today in an e-mailed statement. Romanian land
prices are among the lowest in  Europe , even after year-on-year
increases of 20 percent since 2007, according to the statement.  “We believe Romania offers a compelling case for the three
central factors that make land an attractive asset-class: scope
for land value growth, the ability to acquire freehold land, and
the soil quality for farming the land,” James Townshend, chief
executive officer of Ledbury, England-based  Velcourt Group , said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
