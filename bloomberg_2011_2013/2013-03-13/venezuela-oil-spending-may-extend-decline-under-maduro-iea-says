Venezuela’s investment in oil
exploration and production may extend a long-term decline if
President  Hugo Chavez ’s “anointed successor” is elected,
according to the  International Energy Agency .  Crude output from Venezuela, the fourth-largest oil
producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
fell 22 percent in the 14 years since the election of Chavez,
who died March 5, according to figures in today’s monthly report
from the Paris-based IEA. A victory by Vice President  Nicolas Maduro , Chavez’s handpicked successor, may continue the policy
of using profits from state-owned oil company Petroleos de 
Venezuela SA to fund social welfare projects, the IEA said.  “A Maduro presidency could see a further degradation of
the state oil company and the country’s oil prospects,” the
agency said in in the report. “PDVSA has long been the cash
cow that fueled President Chavez’s expensive social programs to
the detriment of investment in the country’s oil sector.”  Venezuela’s daily crude production was 2.5 million barrels
in 2012, down by 700,000 barrels from when Chavez was elected in
1998, the IEA said.  The nation will hold a special presidential election on
April 14. South America’s largest oil producer will continue to
use the industry’s profits to feed and house the poor, Oil
Minister  Rafael Ramirez  said on state TV this month.  “The post-Chavez transition to a new leadership could
prove raucous, but oil production operations are expected to
remain unaffected with Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez remaining
at the helm of the oil sector,” according to the IEA report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
