South Korean Finance Minister
nominee Hyun Oh Seok speaks to lawmakers today.
* South Korea  needs to be “cautious” about introducing any
taxes on foreign exchange transactions as imposing tax on
trading may hamper capital inflow when needed: Hyun
*Tightening the “level” capital flow control measures
currently in place will be considered if needed: Hyun
NOTE: Nov. 27, 2012: South Korea tightened limits on the amount
of currency forward positions banks are allowed to hold to curb
capital inflow. NSN ME4UYM0YHQ0X <GO>  To contact the reporter on this story:
