Spain’s core  inflation  rate rose in
February as the deepest austerity measures in the nation’s
democratic history sustained price increases while pushing the
economy deeper into a recession.  Core  inflation , which excludes energy and fresh-food
prices, was 2.3 percent last month, up from 2.2 percent in
January, the National Statistics Institute in Madrid said today.
That’s more than the 2.1 percent median of four forecasts in a
Bloomberg survey. Underlying prices were unchanged from the
previous month.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  has ruled out additional
budget cuts in 2013 as he aims to end a six-year slump in the
euro area’s fourth-largest economy. The European Central Bank
last week left its benchmark interest rate unchanged as it
predicted the region will shrink 0.5 percent this year, more
than the 0.3 percent contraction forecast three months ago.  Automaker chief executives including  Fiat SpA (F) ’s Sergio Marchionne and  Renault SA (RNO) ’s Carlos Ghosn spoke out recently
against more austerity in Europe as car sales in January fell to
the lowest for that month since records began in 1990. Spain’s
market, once the region’s fifth biggest, now lags behind Belgium
even though Spain has four times as many people.  Spain’s headline inflation rate, based on European Union
calculations, was 2.9 percent, higher than a preliminary
estimate of 2.8 percent published on Feb. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
