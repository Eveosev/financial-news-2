The government of  Guinea , home to
 Africa ’s largest iron ore deposit, said it’s making progress on
an agreement to share investment in the $10 billion project with
 Rio Tinto  Group.  “The government mobilized necessary means and expertise to
be able to hold its commitments and move forward on the
investment,” government spokesman Albert Damantang Camara said
today in an emailed response to questions.  Rio Tinto, the world’s second-biggest mining company,
continues to work on the project, it said yesterday. The company
slowed progress and cut staff by 90 percent as it awaits a more
stable and secure regulatory framework, Reuters said March 11,
citing unidentified government sources.  “The project is not frozen,” Camara said today.
“Simandou is a highly strategic project for the future of the
Guineans, as it has to allow populations to take advantage
finally of the exploitation of their natural resources,” he
said, without giving more details.  Simandou, which Rio has described as the world’s biggest
undeveloped iron ore deposit, is scheduled to start production
in 2015. The company in June allocated $501 million to build a
rail and port at the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
