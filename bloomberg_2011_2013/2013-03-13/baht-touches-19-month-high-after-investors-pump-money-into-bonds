Thailand ’s baht touched a 19-month
high and government bonds rose as overseas investors pumped the
most money into the nation’s debt in three years.  Global funds  bought  $946 million more sovereign notes than
they sold yesterday, the biggest daily net purchase since
Bloomberg began compiling the data in March 2010. Prime Minister
Yingluck Shinawatra said March 11 the government is targeting an
annual growth rate of 4 percent to 5 percent over the long term,
after a 6.4 percent  expansion  in 2012.  Fitch Ratings  raised its
assessment on Thailand by one level to BBB+ last week, citing a
resilient economy and a more stable political environment.  “There’s a basic trend of fund inflows to the  emerging
markets  with lots of liquidity provided by central banks in
developed nations,” said  Tsutomu Soma , the fixed-income
business unit department manager at Rakuten Securities Inc. in
 Tokyo . “Countries like Thailand with a solid growth outlook are
especially popular and attract more funds.”  The baht rose 0.1 percent to 29.60 per dollar as of 4:04
p.m. in Bangkok after reaching 29.55 earlier, the strongest
level since August 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has gained 3.3 percent this year, the
most in  Asia .  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, dropped six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 5.16 percent.  Overseas investors bought a net $45 million of local
equities yesterday, taking inflows this month to $232 million,
exchange data show.  Investor Confidence  The Bank of Thailand isn’t concerned about the baht’s 0.3
percent gain yesterday because the currency moved in both
directions in late trade, Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said
today, adding, it may have strengthened because of rising
investor confidence after a rating upgrade from Fitch and upward
revisions of economic forecasts.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc estimates Thailand’s
economy will expand 4.7 percent in 2013, according to a research
note yesterday. It maintained its baht forecast at 29.3 by the
end of the second quarter and 29 by year-end.  Thailand rates better than its index peers Malaysia and
 Indonesia  in terms of fiscal account and political stability,
and foreign ownership levels of local currency-denominated debt
trails the other two nations by a wide margin, BNP Paribas SA
said in a note today. Last week, BNP acknowledged the strong
scope for inflows to Thai debt and raised its year-end baht
prediction to an appreciation to 29 from 29.50, it said.  The yield on Thailand’s 3.625 percent government bonds due
June 2023 declined one basis point to 3.64 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The government sold 8 billion baht
($270 million) of notes due 2037 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
