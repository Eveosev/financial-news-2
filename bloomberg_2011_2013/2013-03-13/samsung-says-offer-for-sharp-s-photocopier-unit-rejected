Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , which last
week agreed to invest more than $100 million in  Sharp Corp. (6753) ,
said an offer to buy the Japanese company’s photocopier business
was rejected.  “We initially showed interest to take over Sharp’s
photocopier operation, but Sharp refused the proposal,” Chenny
Kim, a spokeswoman for Samsung, said by phone today, without
disclosing a price. Miyuki Nakayama, a spokeswoman for Sharp,
confirmed the approach was rejected.  Samsung, the biggest maker of smartphones, said March 6 it
will buy about 3 percent of Osaka-based Sharp for 10.4 billion
yen ($108 million) to secure liquid-crystal displays for phones
and televisions. The unprofitable Japanese company is trying to
raise funds with capital alliances and asset sales after
forecasting a record full-year loss of 450 billion yen.  Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung is tightening its focus on
the company’s imaging business as high-end smartphones, its
biggest profit driver, crimp camera demand with high-quality
picture functions.  Samsung’s offer for Sharp’s copier unit was reported
earlier today by Sankei, which didn’t provide a value for the
business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
