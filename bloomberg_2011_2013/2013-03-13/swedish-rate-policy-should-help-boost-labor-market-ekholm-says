Riksbank Deputy Governor Karolina
Ekholm reiterated calls for lower  interest rates  to help the
Swedish labor market and cautioned that focusing on financial
stability can hamper the bank’s main goal of stabilizing demand.  “One should not have exaggerated expectations of what
monetary policy can achieve when it comes to reducing the
relatively high level of unemployment,” Ekholm said in a speech
published today on the Stockholm-based Riksbank’s website.
“However, as long as inflation is expected to be clearly under
the target of 2 percent I believe there is scope to use monetary
policy to try to alleviate the situation on the  labour market .”  The Riksbank last month kept its benchmark repo rate
unchanged at 1 percent -- against the wishes of Ekholm -- after
cutting it four times in a year to boost  Sweden ’s  export -reliant
economy. It will announce its next rate decision on April 17.
Ekholm last month voted against the majority on the six-member
Riksbank board, arguing for a cut to 0.75 percent.  “The risk that low interest rates will increase household
indebtedness and that this in turn will increase the
vulnerability of the households if, for example, housing prices
fall for some reason has been put forward as an argument against
lowering the repo rate,” she said today. “Personally, I do not
believe that the latter risk is particularly serious at present
as the rate of increase in lending to households has declined
significantly since before the financial crisis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
