Mitch Seavey  became the oldest
winner of  Alaska ’s Iditarod dog-sled race at 53, one year after
his son became the annual event’s youngest champion.  The older Seavey, a Seward, Alaska, resident who also won
the Iditarod in 2004, finished the course in 9 days, 7 hours, 39
minutes, 56 seconds, beating  Aliy Zirkle  by 24 minutes. His son
 Dallas  finished fourth, a year after becoming the youngest
winner at age 25.  Mitch Seavey arrived in Nome, Alaska, at 10:39 p.m. local
time with 10 dogs pulling his sled. His result doesn’t top the
 fastest finish , which is held by John Baker, who won the 2011
event in 8 days, 18 hours, 46 minutes, 39 seconds. Norman
Vaughan was the oldest to compete at the age of 86 in 1992.  “This is for all the gentlemen of a certain age who think
it ends at 50, ’cause it doesn’t,” Seavey said after the win,
according to the Anchorage Daily News.  The previous oldest Iditarod champion was Jeff King, who
was 50 when he won in 2006 for the fourth time. King finished
third this year.  The race  was first held in 1973, when Dick Wilmarth won in
20 days. It runs about 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) between
Anchorage and Nome, with the length varying by year. It was
founded to celebrate the use of dog sleds for deliveries in the
state, which organizers thought might be lost with the arrival
of snow mobiles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
