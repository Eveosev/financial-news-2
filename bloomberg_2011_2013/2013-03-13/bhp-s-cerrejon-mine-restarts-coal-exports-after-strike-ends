BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s Cerrejon coal
venture in Colombia said it restarted exports today after a 32-
day strike ended, sending coal to a three-year low.  The mine, Colombia’s largest open-pit coal operation, has
yet to operate at installed capacity after employees signed a
three-year labor accord March 11 and began returning to work,
spokesman Juan Carlos Restrepo said.  “We’re exporting again,” Restrepo said in a telephone
interview from Bogota. “We’re not at 100 percent, but it’s a
matter of waiting a few more days.”  Cerrejon, whose owners also include  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and  Anglo
American Plc (AAL) , produced 34.6 million tons of coal last year,
according to its website. Along with Drummond Co., which
restarted operations last week after a three-week suspension, it
accounted for 80 percent of Colombia’s coal exports of about 75
million tons in 2011, according to the World Coal Association.  The strike cost the mine almost 3 million metric tons in
lost output, Cerrejon President Roberto Junguito said yesterday.
The mine is operating at 70 percent of capacity and should be
close to full capacity when all the mine’s personnel return to
work tomorrow, saidIgor Diaz, president of the National Coal
Industry Workers Union, known as  Sintracarbon .  The labor accord, which includes wage increases,
productivity bonuses and improved health and housing benefits,
gives workers up to 72 hours to return to work.  Thermal coal for 2014 delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp fell 0.8 percent to $95 a ton today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
