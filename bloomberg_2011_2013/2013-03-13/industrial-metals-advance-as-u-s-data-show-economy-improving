Aluminum in  London  rose to a one-
week high and copper climbed for a third day amid speculation
that an improving U.S. economy will drive prices higher,
prompting Chinese users to place orders.  Aluminum for delivery in three months gained as much as 0.6
percent to $1,993 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, the
highest since March 5, before trading at $1,991 by 10:49 a.m.
Shanghai time. Copper advanced 0.3 percent to $7,856 a ton.  The fewest workers on record in the U.S. were fired in
January and job openings rebounded, showing employers are
gaining confidence the U.S. expansion will be sustained even as
lawmakers battle to trim the  federal budget  deficit. Orders to
remove copper from warehouses monitored by the LME jumped 40
percent to 33,400 tons, the biggest gain in more than two months.  “There’s a bit of Chinese buying in LME copper, especially
after the discount of SHFE to LME prices narrowed,” said Xiao
Jing, an analyst at Beijing Capital Futures Co. “This could add
to local stockpiles further, when imports arrive.”  There were 1.51 million people let go in the U.S. in
January, down from 1.57 million in December and the least in
data going back 12 years, the Labor Department said yesterday.
The number of positions waiting to be filled climbed by 81,000
to 3.69 million after slumping by 177,000 in December.  Copper for delivery in June on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange gained 1.4 percent to 57,120  yuan  ($9,183) a ton.  On the LME, zinc, lead and nickel also climbed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
