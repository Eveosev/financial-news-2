German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
Cabinet approved a budget plan that aims to cut the country’s
net borrowing next year and begin running surpluses from 2015,
redoubling the government’s pledge to cut its deficit.  The finance plan reduces Germany’s net new federal
borrowing requirement to 6.4 billion euros ($8.3 billion) in
2014 from 17.1 billion euros this year, according to a draft.
Helped by a surge in tax revenue supported by a stable economy
and robust labor market, Merkel’s government will reduce
borrowing to the lowest level in four decades.  Germany will for the second straight year meet its
obligations under the German-led fiscal compact established last
year to combat the  European debt crisis . Merkel’s reliance on
economic growth may also provide ammunition for critics of her
austerity-first agenda.  Germany  will cut spending to 297 billion euros next year
from 302 billion euros this year, according to the draft. Still,
the opposition-dominated upper house of parliament, or
Bundesrat, is withholding approval of the bill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
