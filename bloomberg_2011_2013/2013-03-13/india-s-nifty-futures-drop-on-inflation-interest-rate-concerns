Indian stocks fell the most in two
weeks on speculation faster inflation will limit the extent to
which the central bank may ease monetary policy next week.  The S&P BSE Sensex index dropped 1 percent to 19,373.54 at
3:10 p.m. in  Mumbai , bound for the steepest slide since Feb. 28.

wholesale prices rose 6.6 percent last month, compared with 6.62
percent in January, according to a Bloomberg survey. The Reserve
Bank of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said last month
inflation risks will affect how much he can cut borrowing costs.  “The inflation rate is not coming down and that will deter
the RBI from easing monetary policy,”  Arun Kejriwal , director
at Mumbai-based Kejriwal Research & Investment Services, said by
phone. “We don’t expect a cut next week.”  The central bank, which reduced the repurchase rate by 25
basis points in January, will review its policy on March 19.  Tata Motors retreated 1.5 percent to 300.1 rupees. Sales of
Jaguar Land Rover dropped 22 percent last month in China, its

percent to 1.71 million units in the 11 months ended in
February, data from the producers’ group show.  “Things are slowing down and auto sales have started to
reflect the mood of the population,” Prateek Agrawal, chief
investment officer at ASK Investment Managers Pvt., which has 16
billion rupees ($299 million) under management, said in an
interview to Bloomberg TV India today. “After a long period of
time we’re looking at negative numbers from the two-wheeler and
automobiles space.”  ICICI Bank retreated 1.7 percent to 1,104.4 rupees. All 14
stocks on the S&P BSE Bankex retreated. The gauge plunged 1.9

compiled by Bloomberg show. India’s economy grew 4.5 percent
from a year ago in the final three months of 2012, the weakest
