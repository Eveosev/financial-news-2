Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos SAB (URBI*) 
plunged for a fifth day, leading Mexico’s benchmark index lower
amid speculation homebuilders aren’t poised to adapt to changes
in government housing policy that favor apartment construction.  Urbi, the country’s third-largest publicly traded
homebuilder by revenue, declined 8.7 percent to 3.46 pesos at
the close of trading in Mexico City. It was the biggest loser
today on the country’s benchmark  IPC index , which fell 1.6
percent.  Desarrolladora Homex SAB (HOMEX*) , the largest homebuilder, sank
1 percent, while No. 2  Corp. Geo SAB (GEOB)  sank 8.4 percent.  A lack of  cash flow , pressure from changes in government
housing policy and looming loan-covenant tests are creating
“the perfect storm,” for homebuilders, said Aldo Miranda, a
trader with Intercam Casa de Bolsa SA in Mexico City.  “They have to restructure their whole business,” Miranda
said in a telephone interview. “It’s going to take time before
we start seeing improvements.”  Investors may also be worried that the government’s housing
policy, which favors apartment construction, will decrease the
value of some land reserves, according to  Carlos Hermosillo , an
analyst with Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB in Mexico City.  “People are concerned about the value of the land they
have,” Hermosillo said in a telephone interview. “That’s why
you see Geo and Urbi falling more than companies like Homex that
have other assets on their balance sheets like the
penitentiaries.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
