Bulgarian inflation slowed in
February as spending on heating and electricity fell because of
mild weather and consumption shrank on high unemployment.  Consumer prices rose 3.6 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a 4.4 percent increase in January, the National
Statistics Institute in Sofia said in a statement today. The
median estimate of four economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 3.8
percent. The inflation rate rose 0.1 percent from the previous
month.  Bulgaria, the European Unionâ€™s poorest country in terms of
economic output per capita, withstood the global recession
without an international bailout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
