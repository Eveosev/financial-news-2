A lawyer for U.S. dietary
supplement companies asked a jury to find that Chinese suppliers
conspired to fix prices for vitamin C.  Chinese firms voluntarily propped up bulk prices of the
nutrient and were not compelled to do so by their government as
they claimed, William Isaacson, the attorney for the U.S. firms,
said today in closing arguments of an antitrust trial in
 Brooklyn ,  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
