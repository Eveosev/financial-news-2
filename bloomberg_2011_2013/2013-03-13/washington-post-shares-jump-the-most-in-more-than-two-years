Washington Post Co. (WPO) , the media and
education company partly owned by billionaire  Warren Buffett ,
gained the most in more than two years in New York trading,
rebounding from a post-earnings slump.  The stock climbed 5.1 percent to $438.26 at the close
today, the biggest one-day gain since Oct. 29, 2010. The shares
have climbed 20 percent this year.  Washington Post’s shares declined after the company’s
earnings were reported on Feb. 22. The company posted a
quarterly net loss of $45.4 million, or 6.57 a share, after
writedowns and restructuring increased expenses.  Standard & Poor’s reiterated its hold rating for Washington
Post shares today, saying the company could benefit from changes
to California law. The state is considering a bill that would
let California public universities accept credit for classes
taught online. Washington Post’s Kaplan division, which accounts
for most of its revenue, could be a candidate to participate,
the firm said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
