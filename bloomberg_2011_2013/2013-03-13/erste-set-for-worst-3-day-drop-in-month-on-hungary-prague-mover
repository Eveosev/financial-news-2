Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  fell
in its biggest three-day retreat in more than a month after
Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said he seeks to reduce
foreign banks’ presence in the country.  Erste, which operates across emerging Europe, including in
Hungary, led stock declines in Prague after Danske Bank A/S
analysts said Orban’s plan revealed yesterday is “in effect
threating to nationalize” part of the industry. Italy’s  Intesa
Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  may curb activities in Hungary, Chief Executive
Officer Enrico Tommaso Cuchicani said yesterday after Orban’s
comments, calling the country a “nightmare.”  “We regard the situation in Hungary and in particular the
prime minister’s statement as continuing negative sentiment”
toward lenders, including the Hungarian unit of Erste, Milan Lavicka, an analyst at J&T Banka AS in Prague, said in a report.  The stock fell 2.2 percent to 23.81 euros by close in
Vienna, extending its loss this week to 6.9 percent. In  Prague 
trading, Erste shares slid 2.3 percent to 612.7 koruna.  Lavicka has a hold rating for Erste with a price estimate
of 20.4 euros, according to the J&T report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
