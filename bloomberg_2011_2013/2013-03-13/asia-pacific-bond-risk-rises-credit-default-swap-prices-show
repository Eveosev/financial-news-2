The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
rose, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased 2 basis points
to 106 basis points as of 11:18 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. prices. The gauge is headed for its first
rise in eight business days after closing yesterday at its
lowest since May 2011, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index advanced 0.5 of a basis point
to 99.75 as of 9:11 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show.
The benchmark, which reached a high this year of 148.1 basis
points on Jan. 4, is set for its first increase since Feb. 26,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan climbed 2 basis points to 103 basis
points as of 8:15 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. prices. The measure is headed for
its highest close since March 7, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
