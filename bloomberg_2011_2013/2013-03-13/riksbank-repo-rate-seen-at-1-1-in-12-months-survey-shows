Sweden ’s central bank will raise
its  main lending rate  1.1 percent in the next year, according to
a survey commissioned by the Riksbank.  Consumer prices  will rise 1 percent in the next 12 months,
down from a 1.1 percent forecast in the previous survey
published in December, TNS Sifo Prospera said, citing the survey
of labor market groups, purchasing managers and money market
participants. Headline inflation will accelerate to 1.5 percent
the following year, staying below the bank’s 2 percent target.  The Riksbank last month kept its benchmark rate unchanged
at 1 percent after cutting it four times in a year to boost
Sweden’s  export -reliant economy. The central bank will announce
its next rate decision on April 17.  The Riksbank will raise its main rate to 1.6 percent in the
next two years and 2.3 percent in five years, according to the
survey. The  economy is estimated to grow  1.2 percent in the next
12 months and 1.9 percent the following year, according to the
survey published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
