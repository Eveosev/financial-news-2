Japan’s target of 2 percent
inflation is out of reach even as the central bank prepares to
accelerate monetary stimulus, said  Geoff Kendrick , head of
European FX strategy at Nomura International Plc.  “To achieve inflation in Japan is extremely difficult,”
Kendrick said at  Bloomberg Link ’s FX Debates in London. “You
have a whole generation that expects inflation close to zero and
changing that takes time. They won’t achieve 2 percent inflation
in the core sense.”  The  Bank of Japan  said in January it will buy 13 trillion
yen ($135.8 billion) in assets each month next year to cap
borrowing costs, while setting an inflation target of 2 percent.  Further action from Japanese policy makers is likely to
cause the yen to weaken further, said Peter Rosenstreich, chief
foreign-exchange strategist at Swissquote Bank SA.  “I expect more yen weakness and what the BOJ has in store
for the yen will make it a prime funding currency,” he said at
the FX Debates. “This will get pretty exciting when the BOJ
realizes asset buying is not providing the kick and steps up to
more radical solutions.”  The yen traded at 95.79 per dollar at 11:46 a.m. in London,
having slumped 13 percent over the past three months. The
currency slid to 96.71 yesterday, the weakest since August 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
