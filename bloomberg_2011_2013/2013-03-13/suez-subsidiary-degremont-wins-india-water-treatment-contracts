Suez Environnement (SEV) , Europe’s third-
largest water company by market value, won 41 million euros ($53
million) of contracts to build and operate water-treatment
plants in  New Delhi  and Bangalore, India’s Silicon Valley.  Suez’s subsidiary Degremont said today in a  statement  that
the contract in India’s capital, where more than 17 million
people reside, was awarded by the Delhi Jal Board to construct
and manage a plant in which treated wastewater will be re-used
by local industries and the Delhi Gate Nalla power plant.  The Bangalore Water Supply & Sewerage Board awarded
Degremont a contract for an advanced wastewater treatment plant
that will help meet the water needs of the new technology and
automobile park at Raja Canal. Degremont has been in  India  for
30 years, has built 153 plants and currently operates 18 of
them, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
