Nigeria ’s government said claims by
 Italy ,  Greece  and the U.K. that foreigners kidnapped by an
Islamist group in northern Nigeria last month are “premature”
conclusions.  “It is not confirmed,” Interior Minister Abba Moro told
reporters today in Abuja, the capital. “When investigations are
concluded the federal government will have the courage to tell
the people the true position of things.”  Three Lebanese, including a woman, were seized along with a
Filipino, a Greek, an Italian and a Briton in a Feb. 16 attack
on a residential compound of  Setraco Nigeria Ltd. , a
construction company, in Bauchi state, according to the Nigerian
authorities. A local security guard was killed in the raid.  A March 9  statement  from Jama’atu Ansarul Muslimina Fi
Biladissudan, or “Group of Supporters of Muslims in the Land of
the Blacks,” an offshoot of Boko Haram, said the hostages were
killed after British and Nigerian security forces made an
attempt to rescue them. The group had earlier claimed
responsibility for the abduction.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer, has been battling Boko
Haram, a militant Islamist group that’s carried out gun and bomb
attacks in the north and Abuja, leaving hundreds of people dead
since 2009. Africa’s most populous country with more than 160
million people is roughly split between the largely Muslim north
and the predominantly Christian south.  To contact the reporter on this story:
