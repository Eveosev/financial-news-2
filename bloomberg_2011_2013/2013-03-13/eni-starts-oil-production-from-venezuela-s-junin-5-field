Eni SpA (ENI) , Italy’s largest oil
company, said its joint venture with  Petroleos de Venezuela SA 
has started producing oil from the Junin-5 block, advancing
Venzeula’s plans to develop the world’s largest reserves.  Production from the block in the Orinoco Belt will reach
15,000 barrels a day by the end of the year and 75,000 barrels
in 2015, the Rome-based company said in a  statement  today. The
company had previously estimated it would reach 75,000 barrels
of output from Junin-5 this year.  The block, which holds the equivalent of 35 billion barrels
of oil, is about 550 kilometers (342 miles) southeast of
Caracas, the company said. The Orinoco fields may hold more
crude reserves than  Saudi Arabia , according to the  U.S.
Geological Survey .  Constanza Viola, an Eni spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mailed request for comment on the project’s
costs. PDVSA President  Rafael Ramirez  said in July 2011 that Eni
will lend the state oil company $1.5 billion for its share of
development costs for the block. PDVSA holds 60 percent of
Junin-5 and Eni has 40 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
