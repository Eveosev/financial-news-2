Kiddicare, the baby equipment
retailer owned by  WM Morrison Supermarkets Plc (MRW) , will open six
more superstores by August, bringing the total to 10, Chief
Executive Officer Scott Weavers-Wright said.  “The ambition is that I want 20 stores around the
country,” said Weavers-Wright, who joined Morrison’s when it
acquired Kiddicare for 70 million pounds ($105 million) in 2011.
Weavers-Wright also runs Morrison’s online non-food business.  Kiddicare, which opened its first outlet last year and now
has four stores, expects to generate annual sales of 200 million
pounds by 2015, Weavers-Wright said in an interview in London
today. Kiddicare stores should generate half of total revenue.
About 85 percent of sales, “exceeding 60 million pounds a
year,” currently come from online orders, he said.  Kiddicare decided to open stores because the presence will
allow expecting parents to try out the merchandise, such as
buggies and cots, Weavers-Wright said.  Morrisons, the U.K.’s fourth-largest grocer, is losing
market share in part because it doesn’t have an online grocery
business. It has a 10 percent stake in U.S. grocer FreshDirect,
and Chief Executive officer Dalton Philips will unveil the
company’s U.K. online strategy tomorrow when he reports full-
year results.  Weavers-Wright will also lead the new online grocery
business, Retail Week reported today.  Mothercare, a retailer of nursery equipment that set out a
three-year turnaround plan in April 2012, posted a 5.9 percent
decline in third-quarter same-store sales in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
