Soybeans dropped for a second day
as the harvest advances in  Brazil , poised to be the largest
grower this year, boosting supplies available for shipment.  About 10.5 million metric tons of soybeans and products
were scheduled for shipment on vessels berthed, arrived or
expected at major ports in Brazil as of yesterday, from 10.27
million tons a week earlier, according to SA Commodities and
Unimar Agenciamentos Maritimos. About 48 percent of the crop was
harvested as of March 8, researcher Safras & Mercado said. The
country may harvest a record crop of 83.5 million tons this
year, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates.  “Reports that the Brazilian soybean harvest continues to
surge ahead, and that supplies are making their way through to
the port onto waiting ships, weighed on prices,”  Luke Mathews ,
a commodity strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , wrote
in a report today.  Soybeans for May delivery fell 0.4 percent to $14.635 a
bushel by 7:15 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. Trading
volume was 27 percent lower than the 100-day average for that
time of day.  Ships are waiting as many as 60 days to load the oilseed at
Brazilian ports, Hamburg-based researcher Oil World said
yesterday. Soybean prices may decline in the second half of the
year as Brazil’s shipping delays ease while U.S. farmers boost
output, it said.  Corn for May delivery rose 0.3 percent to $7.1625 a bushel.
Wheat for May delivery climbed 0.4 percent to $7.0625 a bushel
in  Chicago . In Paris, milling wheat for the same delivery month
gained 0.3 percent to 233.25 euros ($303.48) a ton on NYSE
Liffe. The grain fell to an eight-month low at 230 euros on
March 8.  Wheat exports from Australia, the world’s third-biggest
shipper, may climb 13 percent to 18 million tons in the year
beginning November, according to CBH Group, the nation’s largest
grain handler. India, the second-largest wheat grower, after
China, is seeking to export the grain to Egypt, the world’s
biggest buyer, the Egyptian Trade and Supply Minister Bassem Oda
said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
