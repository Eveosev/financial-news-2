Gasoline rose on speculation that
U.S. supplies fell last week and as a report showed  retail sales 
rose the most in five months, indicating a stronger economy.  Futures gained as much as 1.2 percent. The median of 11
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg  predict  the government
will say gasoline supplies fell 1.2 million barrels in the week
ended March 8. The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute 
reported yesterday a 3.12 million-barrel decline and a 1.8
percentage-point drop in refinery operating rates. Sales at U.S.
retailers  increased  1.1 percent in February, Commerce Department
figures showed today.  “There has been supportive economic news and retail sales
are the latest,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston. “The API showed a significant drop
in inventories and a significant drop in utilization rates and
that is surprising.”  Gasoline for April delivery rose 2.33 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $3.1735 a gallon at 9:43 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, the first increase in three days. Trading
volume was 6.1 percent below the 100-day average for the time of
day. The contract is for reformulated gasoline to be blended
with ethanol, or RBOB.  Heating oil for April delivery gained 0.72 cent to $2.9556
a gallon on volume that was 42 percent below the 100-day average
for the time of day.  Gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.3 cent to
$3.706 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices are 9.9
cents below a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
