Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal
Industry Corp.,  Japan â€™s biggest steelmaker, plans to close a
blast furnace at its largest mill near  Tokyo  to save costs as it
seeks to become more competitive with Asian rivals.  The number three furnace at Kimitsu in Chiba prefecture
will cease operations by the end of fiscal 2015, the Tokyo-based
company said today in a statement outlining its mid-term plans.
Nippon Steel will also postpone its Wakayama number two furnace
operations, it said.  The closure comes as Chief Executive Officer Shoji Muneoka
pushes to pare costs and to streamline operations at the company
created by the merger in October of  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401)  and
Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. The company in November raised
its cost-saving targets by 33 percent to 200 billion yen ($2.1
billion) annually after three years of integration.  Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal inherited 16 steelworks in
Japan with 14 blast furnaces, which use  iron ore  and coal as raw
materials to produce the alloy. The company will secure
employment by moving extra jobs to overseas facilities and
affiliates, Muneoka said Sept. 26.  The  shares  rose 0.4 percent to 262 yen as of 3 p.m. in
Tokyo trading, extending gains this year to 25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
