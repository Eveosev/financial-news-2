South African  retail sales  growth
slowed in January as job losses, high debt levels and inflation
curbed  consumer spending  in Africa’s biggest economy.  Sales rose 1.9 percent from a year earlier, down from a
revised 2.2 percent pace in December, Pretoria-based Statistics
 South Africa  said on its website today. The  median estimate  in a
Bloomberg survey of 12 economists was 3.6 percent. Sales
declined 1.2 percent in the month in data that was rebased to
2012 from 2008.  “Households seem to be putting a break on spending,”
Thabi Leoka, head of macro research at Standard Bank Group Ltd.,
said in a phone interview. “We expect uninspiring growth in the
first half of the year.”  The  unemployment  rate of 25 percent is the highest of 39
 emerging markets  monitored by Bloomberg. The economy will
probably expand 2.7 percent this year from 2.5 percent in 2012,
Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said last month. That’s less
than half the 7 percent pace the government says is needed to
meet its target to reduce joblessness to 14 percent by 2020.  Gross domestic demand, which includes consumers, government
and investments, contracted for the first time since 2009 in the
fourth quarter, dropping an annualized 0.9 percent, the  Reserve
Bank  said yesterday. Growth in consumer spending, which makes up
about two-thirds of expenditure in the economy, slowed to an
annualized 2.4 percent last quarter from 2.7 percent in the
prior three months.  The central bank has kept its benchmark  interest rate  at 5
percent since a surprise cut in July, concerned that a weaker
rand will push the inflation rate above its 3 percent to 6
percent target range.  The rand extended its decline after today’s data, dropping
0.3 percent to 9.1978 per dollar at 1:13 p.m. in Johannesburg.
The yield on the rand debt due in 2021 was little changed at
6.51 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
