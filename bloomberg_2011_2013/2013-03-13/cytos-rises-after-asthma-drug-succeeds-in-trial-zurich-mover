Cytos Biotechnology AG (CYTN) , a Swiss
developer of an experimental drug for allergic asthma, rose to
the highest price in almost two months after the medicine met
its main goals in a patient study.  Cytos climbed 14 percent to 4.44 Swiss francs as of 9:32
a.m. in Zurich, the highest intraday level since Jan. 17. That
gives Schlieren, Switzerland-based Cytos a market value of 95.3
million francs ($101 million). More than 137,000 shares were
traded in the first half hour, almost three times the three-
month daily average. The stock was the  biggest gainer  on the
Swiss Performance Index.  In a trial among 63 patients in  Germany , those treated with
the drug, CYT003, had improved control of their asthma after
treatment with inhaled corticosteroids stopped, while those who
received a placebo saw their disease worsen, Cytos said in a
statement today. The drug was safe and generally well-tolerated,
Cytos said.  Results from a follow-up trial in 360 patients that started
in the fourth quarter of last year are expected in the first
half of 2014, Cytos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
