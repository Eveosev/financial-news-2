Most  European stocks  declined as
earnings reports from Inditex SA to  Enel (ENEL)  SpA offset an increase
in U.S. retail sales by the most in five months.  Inditex lost 2.6 percent after the world’s biggest clothing
retailer reported the slowest profit growth in five quarters.
Enel,  Italy ’s biggest utility, tumbled to a six-month low after
posting a 79 percent slump in net income. Prudential Plc jumped
to a 13-year high as the insurer raised its 2012 dividend.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  slipped less than 0.1 percent to
295.32, as four shares retreated for every three that advanced.
The gauge climbed to the highest level since June 2008 on March
8 as economic reports from U.S. payrolls to Chinese exports
bolstered confidence in the global recovery.  “At this point, we don’t necessarily expect a substantial
correction,” Daniel Morris, a market strategist at JPMorgan
Chase & Co., told Caroline Hyde on Bloomberg Television in
London. “Fundamental support for equities is still good. We
still look for equities’ appreciation for the rest of the
year.”  The Stoxx 600 pared an earlier drop of as much as 0.5
percent as U.S. retail sales topped forecasts. The 1.1 percent
advance last month exceeded all projections in a Bloomberg
survey and followed a revised 0.2 percent gain in January,
Commerce Department figures showed today in  Washington .  Euro-Area Industry  A report from the European Union’s statistics office
earlier today showed  industrial production  in the euro area fell
0.4 percent in January, adding to signs that the region’s
recession extended into the first quarter. The median economist
forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for a 0.1 percent decline.  National benchmark indexes declined in 10 of the 18 markets
in western  Europe .  France ’s CAC 40 lost 0.1 percent, the U.K.’s
FTSE 100 fell 0.5 percent and  Germany ’s DAX added less than 0.1
percent.  Italy’s  FTSE MIB (FTSEMIB)  slid 1.6 percent as borrowing costs rose
in the first bond auction since last week’s credit-rating
downgrade. The country sold 3.32 billion euros of a 2015 note at
2.48 percent. Ireland’s ISEQ Index slipped 0.2 percent as the
country sells 10-year bonds for the first time since seeking
financial aid in 2010.  Inditex (ITX)  dropped 2.6 percent to 105.65 euros in  Madrid . The
retailer reported a 12 percent decline in net income to 705
million euros in the three months through January. The average
of analyst forecasts in a Bloomberg survey called for 716
million euros.  Enel Earnings  Enel fell 6 percent to 2.61 euros, the lowest price since
August. The utility reported 2012 net income to 865 million
euros and said earnings won’t recover until 2017 as taxes and
weakening power demand in its biggest markets crimp growth.  Commerzbank AG tumbled 9.7 percent to 1.26 euros, the
sharpest decrease in 15 months, after Germany’s second-biggest
lender announced a 2.5 billion euros ($3.3 billion) share sale
to repay investments by a German government fund and  Allianz SE .
The lender is also asking shareholders to approve a share
consolidation reducing the number of shares to 583 million from
5.83 billion.  Direct Line Insurance Group Plc slid 2.5 percent to 205
pence in London after Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc sold a
stake in the U.K.’s biggest home and motor insurer, raising  507
million pounds ($758 million). Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley and UBS AG placed the 252.3 million Direct Line shares
at 201 pence apiece.  RBS slipped 2 percent to 300.1 pence.  ASM Drops  ASM International NV lost 10 percent to 27.85 euros, the
biggest drop since November 2008. The maker of semiconductor
equipment announced plans to sell a stake of as much as 12
percent in ASM Pacific Technology Ltd. in an effort to increase
the value of its combined businesses.  “People were anticipating a breakup of the company, and
this is kind of a setback,” said Jos Versteeg, an analyst at
Theodoor Gilissen Bankiers. “I think the company decided it
still needs ASM PT as a cash cow.”  Prudential advanced 9.3 percent to 1,125 pence, its highest
price since January 2000, after the biggest U.K. insurer by
market value raised its 2012 dividend 16 percent to 29.19 pence
a share. The company reported a 25 percent increase in operating
profit to 2.53 billion pounds in 2012, beating the average
analyst estimate of 2.32 billion pounds.  Royal Imtech NV increased 4.6 percent to 10.20 euros as the
technical-services provider late yesterday said it reached an
out-of-court settlement with Adventure World Warsaw. The shares
have still lost 41 percent this year as the company had
predicted writedowns exceeding 100 million euros in  Poland .  To contact the reporter on this story:
