SynQor Inc.’s $95 million patent-
infringement victory against nine manufacturers of power
converters in computer systems, including  Emerson Electric Co. (EMR) ’s
Artesyn, was upheld today by a U.S. appeals court.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
 Washington  upheld a jury verdict won by SynQor and said the
trial judge was correct to enhance the damage award. The
 decision  was posted on the court’s website.  The dispute is over safety features that control how much
electricity goes to large computer systems, as well as
telecommunication and data communication equipment. The other
companies that remained in the appeal are Emerson’s Astec, Delta
America Ltd.,  Bel Fuse Inc. (BELFA)  and Murata Manufacturing Co.  Emerson’s Artesyn and Astec were told to pay about $14
million; Delta $5.8 million; Murata about $18 million; and Bel
Fuse $8.1 million, according to the final judgment issued by the
judge in the case. The companies also were told to pay
additional damages for infringement after the verdict, and
$500,000 in sanctions were imposed on Delta for violating court
rules.  The case is SynQor Inc. v. Artesyn Technologies Inc.,
2011-1191,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit
(Washington). The lower court case is SynQor Inc. v. Artesyn
Technologies Inc., 07cv497, U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas (Marshall).  To contact the reporter on this story:
