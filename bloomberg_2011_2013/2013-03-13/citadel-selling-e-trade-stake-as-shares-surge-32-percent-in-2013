E*Trade Financial Corp. (ETFC)  dropped the
most in five months after Citadel LLC, its largest shareholder,
said it’s selling the rest of its equity stake in the fourth-
largest online brokerage by client assets.  Shares of the broker declined 5.8 percent to $11.14 at
11:06 a.m. New York time in the biggest intraday slump since
Oct. 19. Before today, the New York-based company had gained 32
percent in 2013, compared with the 9 percent advance in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Citadel, the Chicago-based hedge fund run by  Ken Griffin ,
plans to sell its remaining equity stake, about 27.4 million
shares, by March 19, according to a release yesterday from
E*Trade. The hedge fund, whose 9.6 percent stake made it the
biggest holder, asked E*Trade in 2011 to hire a bank to review
strategic alternatives and take immediate action to maximize
 shareholder value  after “catastrophic losses” that had driven
the shares down 97 percent since 2007.  Citadel invested $2.55 billion in E*Trade in November 2007
to help the company survive mortgage losses.  While E*Trade refused to put the company up for sale last
year, it ousted Chief Executive Officer Steven J. Freiberg in
August and named Citadel’s Griffin to the search committee.
Freiberg was replaced by former Barclays Plc executive Paul
Idzik in January as the company’s fifth top executive in five
years.  The sale represents about $323.9 million, based on
yesterday’s closing price of $11.82 a share. E*Trade won’t get
any proceeds from the sale, according to the release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
