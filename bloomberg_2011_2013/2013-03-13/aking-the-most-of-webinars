If you're anything like I am, you listen to webinars with one ear, occasionally checking your computer screen if a graph or image is referenced, perhaps catching up on email or articles while the webinar is running in the background.  Despite the challenges for viewers, everyone from for-profit companies like  LinkedIn  and  Procter and Gamble  to non-profits like the  Red Cross  and  City Year  to professional associations like the  American Medical Association  and the  American Bar Association   to publishers like  HBR  run webinars. These sessions are designed to do everything from teach particular skills or tools to discuss trends in different sectors.  And they are aimed at all sorts of audiences, from clients to colleagues.   But while they're ubiquitous, webinars aren't generally especially effective teachers.  Why?  Content isn't tailored to the viewer, the virtual experience offers few opportunities to engage with speakers, there are no consequence if you don't attend, and no rewards if you do.  Of course, there are exceptions.  But here's the bottom line: there is little oversight or quality control even with webinars that count toward professional development requirements, or ones for which the participant or his organization have paid a fee.  How can webinar developers engage viewers?  And how can viewers learn more from webinars?  Research on which methods are most effective for sharing knowledge related to innovation provide some clues.  In the  California Civic Innovation Project' s (CCIP) recent survey of city managers and county administrators in California, we found that webinars attempting to provide information about innovation in local government are not as effective as many other techniques.  When we asked officials to evaluate the value of sources of information used in researching and implementing important new approaches, webinars ranked very low on the list.  The most valuable sources: those that allowed direct, informal contact with human beings — personal contacts, other city/county staffers in California, and community groups.  Webinars ranked between list-servs from professional associations and magazines and newsletters from professional associations.   Webinars can be valuable when they are offered and consumed under the right circumstances, or when they address areas unrelated to approaches to innovation — training to use a technology, or information about the details of a new legislative requirement, for example.  Indeed, in certain cases, webinars have advantages over other types of learning.  Webinars don't require the time or expense of travel.  And participation in webinars doesn't generally require an extensive network. But in order to make webinars work, both those offering the webinars and those participating need to do more to make the experience worthwhile.   Follow-up interviews with survey respondents, and survey findings related to the importance of personal relationships and employee engagement suggest some practical approaches to how webinars can be made more effective.  Professional associations and others promoting webinars should keep these rules of thumbs in mind when developing webinar content: And those watching webinars need to hold up their end of the bargain, too.  Here are some things participants can do to maximize their webinar experiences: Of course there is no way completely to avoid the occasional pitfall.  Even the most conscientious webinar-attendee will miss one occasionally, failing to make good on his promise to watch the session at a later date.  Even professional associations that spend a great deal of time and thought selecting topics and designing curricula will choose a dud of a speaker.  Every once in a while the technology simply won't work.  But webinars can be made into much more valuable resources if both sponsors and attendees do more to make the experiences worthwhile ones.
