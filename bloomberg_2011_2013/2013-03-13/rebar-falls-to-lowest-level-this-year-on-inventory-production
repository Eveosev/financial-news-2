Steel reinforcement-bar futures
declined for a sixth day to the lowest level this year as
swelling inventory and record output in  China  increased concern
that the market is oversupplied.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 1 percent to 3,853  yuan  ($620) a metric
ton, the lowest level for a most-active contract since Dec. 25,
before trading at 3,862 at 9:59 a.m. local time.  Inventory jumped 86 percent this year through March 8,
according to Shanghai Steelhome Information. Total crude-steel
production in China gained 9.8 percent in February from a year
ago to 61.83 million tons, the statistics bureau said yesterday.
Average daily crude-steel output rose to 2.2 million tons last
month, a record high, according to a report by Wanda Futures Co.  “Crude-steel output is increasing and building-material
inventory is climbing quickly, all adding pressure to prices in
the short term,” Le Yukun and Hang Yijun, analysts at BOC
International China Ltd., said in a report late yesterday.  The  average spot price  for rebar fell for a seventh day
yesterday by 0.7 percent to 3,726 yuan a ton, according to data
from Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  Iron ore  for
immediate delivery fell 0.5 percent yesterday to $143.40 a ton
yesterday, lowest since Dec. 28, according to data compiled by
The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
