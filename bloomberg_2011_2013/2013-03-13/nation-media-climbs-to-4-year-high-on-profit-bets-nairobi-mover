Nation Media Group Ltd. (NMG) , East
Africa’s biggest media company, rose to the highest level in
more than four and a half years on speculation profit growth
accelerated last year.  The  stock climbed  as much as 5.7 percent to 297 shillings
and traded at 282 shillings by 1:24 p.m. in Nairobi, the
strongest intraday level since July 2008.  First-half  profit  jumped 25 percent to 915 million
shillings ($10.7 million) as revenue increased 13 percent, the
company said in August. Nation Media is scheduled to announce
full-year earnings on March 20.  “I am expecting very good numbers and a lot of guys are
taking positions,” Davis Mika, an analyst at Nairobi-based
Contrarian Investing Kenya Ltd., said by phone. “My estimate is
for 30 percent growth in profit.”  Nation Media said in August it partnered with  Diamond Trust
Bank Kenya Ltd. (DTKL)  to offer a money-transfer card. The service,
known as NationHela, allows Kenyans living abroad to send money
back home and domestic users pay utility bills.  “There is expectation of very strong numbers mainly
because advertising revenue has been pretty good and they’ve
done pretty well in diversifying their products,” Eric Musau, a
research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank Ltd.,
said in a phone interview. “We have been seeing investors
building up the stock.”  Nation Media has advanced 28 percent this year, compared
with a 26 percent rally for the  Nairobi Securities Exchange All-
Share Index. (NSEASI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
