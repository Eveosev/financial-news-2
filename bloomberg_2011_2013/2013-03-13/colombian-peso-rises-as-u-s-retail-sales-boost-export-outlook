Colombia’s peso rose to a three-
week high after a report showing U.S. retail sales exceeded
forecasts in February bolstered the outlook for the Andean
nation’s exports.  The peso gained 0.1 percent to 1,797.60 per U.S. dollar at
the close of trading in Bogota, paring its drop this year to 1.7
percent.  “Retail numbers out of the U.S. are signaling a path to
more solid growth, and that’s good news for Colombia’s
exports,” said Jorge Cardozo, an analyst at Corredores
Asociados brokerage in Bogota.  The U.S. is Colombia’s biggest trading partner, buying
about 30 percent of its exports. The 1.1 percent retail sales
advance exceeded all projections of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg and followed a revised 0.2 percent gain in January,
Commerce Department figures showed today in  Washington .  Yields on Colombia’s benchmark peso bonds due 2024 were
little changed at 4.90 percent, according to the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
