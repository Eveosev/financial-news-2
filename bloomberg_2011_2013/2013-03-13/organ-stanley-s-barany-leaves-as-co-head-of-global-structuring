Jeff Barany,  Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s co-
head of a group that creates fixed-income securities for
institutions and wealthy individuals, has left the bank and the
business will be run by Davide Menini, his counterpart in
 London .  Barany, a managing director in  New York , confirmed his
departure yesterday in a telephone interview. He joined the bank
in 1999, according to online  records  of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  Menini, who was co-head with Barany, will now lead global
macro structuring on his own, said two people with knowledge of
the moves who asked not to be identified because they haven’t
been announced publicly.  Lauren Onis, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley in New York,
and Menini declined to comment.  Morgan Stanley is the top issuer of structured notes in the
U.S. this year, selling $1.16 billion of the securities,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in  interest rates  or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
