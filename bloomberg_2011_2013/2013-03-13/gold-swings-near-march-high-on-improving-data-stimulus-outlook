Gold fell, ending the longest rally
since August, as stronger data in the U.S. eased pressure on the
 Federal Reserve  to expand its stimulus measures to boost growth.  U.S. retail sales rose 1.1 percent in February, the most in
five months, the Commerce Department said today. The  Federal
Open Market Committee , which meets March 19-20, is debating how
long to continue the $85 billion in monthly purchases of
Treasuries and mortgage bonds. Gold prices have declined 5.2
percent this year, partly on concern that Fed may end its
stimulus program. The dollar has gained 3.9 percent against a
basket of currencies in 2013.  “The better-than-expected retail-sales report and the
strength in the dollar are holding gold back,”  Frank Lesh , a
trader at FuturePath Trading in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “There’s still fear out there in general, and people
are also watching to see what the Fed will do when it meets.”  Gold futures for April delivery slipped 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,588.40 an ounce at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Prices rose in each of the previous four sessions, gaining
1.1 percent.  China  should only invest 1 percent to 2 percent of its
foreign exchange reserves in gold because the market is too
small, Yi Gang, a deputy governor for the central bank, said
today at a briefing in Beijing. While Chinese purchases may
raise prices and hurt domestic consumers, bullion is always an
option for China’s investments, Yi said. The metal accounts for
about 1.8 percent of the nation’s reserves, World Gold Council
data show.  Silver futures for May delivery dropped 0.7 percent to
$28.958 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery slid 0.1 percent to $1,593.10 an ounce.  Palladium futures for June delivery retreated 0.5 percent
to $771.25 an ounce. Futures trading volume was 60 percent below
the average in the past 100 days for this time of day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
