My colleagues Justin Wolfers and Betsey Stevenson  provocatively argue  that Representative Paul Ryan, the Republican Party's de facto spokesman on economic policy, is "an inflation nutter" because he is concerned that future budget deficits may lead to rapid price inflation.  Wolfers and Stevenson contrast Ryan's fears with the market's expectations of inflation, as expressed by the difference in yields between normal government bonds and inflation-indexed equivalents. This "breakeven" represents the average annualized inflation rate investors would be willing to tolerate to be indifferent between the two types of bonds.  Right now, America's 30-year breakeven inflation rate is just under 2.6 percent. The Consumer Price Index has not grown that slowly over a 30-year period since the Great Depression. In other words, if the markets are right, there is no reason to worry about inflation any time soon. But the markets have been wrong before. Ryan's views, right or wrong, are supported by a very distinguished group of academic economists, including  Christopher Sims , who won the Nobel Prize in 2011 for his work on macroeconomics, and  Michael Woodford , who is often cited as one of the world's leading monetary theorists. Starting in the 1990s, various scholars began formalizing the "fiscal theory of the price level." Woodford described this in  a 1995 paper : John Cochrane, of the University of Chicago,  wrote a very readable essay  that tackles these issues in greater detail. Those interested in the full scholarly treatment should read  this ,  this ,  this ,  this ,  this  and  this . The interesting question is whether the fiscal theory of the price level actually makes sense. I have three thoughts: Mr. Ryan may be many things, but "inflation nutter" is not among them.
