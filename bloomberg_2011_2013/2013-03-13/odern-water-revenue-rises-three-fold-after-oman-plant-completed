Modern Water Plc (MWG) , which completed
the worldâ€™s first commercial forward-osmosis desalination plant
last year in Oman, said revenue tripled as the company competed
with more reverse-osmosis water purifiers.  Modern Water, whose shares trade in London, supplies
advanced systems for water monitoring and treatment, touting
benefits of its membrane-based forward-osmosis technology that
includes lower energy consumption for highly contaminated
waters.  The company said today that revenue rose to 3.8 million
pounds ($5.7 million) in 2012 from 1.2 million pounds a year
earlier, it has no debt and its cash improved with 9.5 million
pounds of net proceeds this year from a share placement. It said
water-stressed countries in the Middle East and China are key
markets for its technology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
