Clayton Homes Inc., the maker of
manufactured houses owned by  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) , had the outlook on its long-term debt raised by  Standard &
Poor’s  amid an improving U.S. residential real estate market.  The credit-rating company changed its outlook on Clayton to
stable from negative in a report today, citing the housing
unit’s improved profitability and an increase in new retail
sales last year from 2011. Clayton’s  BBB rating  may be raised if
the company’s leverage decreases or if earnings advance
consistently, S&P said.  “The stable outlook reflects our view that Clayton’s
business and financial positions will gradually improve as the
broader U.S. housing market continues to heal,” S&P wrote.
“After several years of decline, following the U.S. housing
bubble, residential real estate is showing signs of recovery.”  A rebounding housing market has helped Omaha, Nebraska-
based Berkshire’s subsidiaries that make carpet, bricks,
insulation and houses. Pretax profit at Clayton climbed to $255
million last year from $154 million in 2011, Buffett, 82, said
in his annual  letter  to shareholders March 1. The housing unit
boosted production 14 percent last year, he wrote.  New-home sales climbed 15.6 percent nationally in January,
the most in two decades, to a 437,000 annual pace, Commerce
Department figures showed last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
