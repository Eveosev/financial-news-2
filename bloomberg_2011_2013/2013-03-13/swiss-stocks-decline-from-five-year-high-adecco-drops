Swiss stocks  retreated from a five-
year high before a report that may show euro-area industrial
output fell in January.  Adecco SA (ADEN) , the biggest supplier of temporary workers, slid
the most since October after fourth-quarter profit missed
analyst estimates. SGS SA, the world’s largest product
inspector, gained after UBS AG added the shares to its preferred
list.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  fell 0.3 percent to 7,782.78 at 9:21
a.m. in Zurich after yesterday closing at its highest level
since February 2008. The benchmark gauge has still climbed 14
percent this year as the U.S. unemployment rate fell and
speculation mounted that central banks will continue to support
economic recovery. The broader Swiss Performance Index also
dropped 0.3 percent today.  Euro-area industrial production declined 0.1 percent in
January, after increasing 0.7 percent in December, economists
predicted before a release from the European Union’s statistics
office in Luxembourg at 11 a.m. local time.  Adecco lost 4.2 percent to 52.40 francs, the biggest drop
since Oct. 26. The company reported fourth-quarter net income of
35 million euros, missing the average analyst estimate of 82.8
million euros.  SGS (SGSN)  advanced 0.9 percent to 2,419 Swiss francs as UBS added
the stock to its most preferred list of shares.  Cytos Biotechnology AG (CYTN)  jumped 8.4 percent to 4.24 francs.
