National Financial Partners Corp. (NFP) ,
the brokerage run by Jessica Bibliowicz, climbed in New York
trading after saying it was considering selling itself.  The firm rose 13 percent to $22.71 at 12:17 p.m., the
highest since 2008. The New York-based company said in a
statement today that it had received indications of interest
from private-equity firms and formed a committee of independent
directors to consider a sale.  National Financial Partners, initially backed by private-
equity firm  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) , has been adding
insurance and investment salesmen since it sold its stock in an
initial public offering about 10 years ago. Bibliowicz, the
daughter of former Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer
Sanford “Sandy” Weill, plans to step down as CEO in May, the
company said in a November filing.  The brokerage’s net income fell to $29.9 million in 2012
from $36.9 million a year earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Its market capitalization was $800 million yesterday
before the statement. Reuters reported the buyout interest late
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
