Porsche SE,  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s largest
shareholder, reported a surge in 2012 net income after selling
the remainder of its automaking business to VW last year.  Profit climbed to 7.83 billion euros ($10.1 billion) from
59 million euros in 2011, the Stuttgart, Germany-based holding
company said in a statement today. Porsche received a cash
inflow of 4.49 billion euros from the sale of the final 50.1
percent of the auto unit to VW.  The holding company, whose sole asset is VW shares,
proposed a dividend for 2012 of 2.01 euros per preferred share
and 2.00 per ordinary share. Porsche expects profit in the “low
single-digit billion-euro range” for 2013.  Volkswagen finalized the acquisition of the Porsche sports-
car business in August, ending a seven-year saga that saw
VW turn the tables on the maker of the 911. With the purchase,
VW assumed full ownership of the Porsche auto brand.  Porsche SE remains a holding company for a 50.7 percent
stake in VW’s common stock. After repaying 2 billion euros in
bank debt, it said last year that it plans to use proceeds from
the transaction to make investments “along the automotive value
chain,” including in energy trading and real estate.  Porsche  gained  as much as 1.70 euros, or 2.7 percent, to
64.50 euros and was up 0.2 percent as of 3:45 p.m. in  Frankfurt .
The stock has climbed 2 percent this year, valuing the German
company at 19.3 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
