Thousands of Syrian children are living in parks, barns, caves, and even chicken coops, while others are compelled to serve as soldiers and porters, according to the Save the Children charity.  Syrians are being forced to seek refuge wherever they can, enduring winter temperatures as low as -8 degrees Celsius (18 Fahrenheit), the charity said in its report, entitled Childhood Under Fire. The majority of people are staying with friends or relatives in overcrowded apartments or houses. In total, about 2 million children are thought to be trapped in the country, it said.  “This is a war that is disproportionately affecting children,” said Save the Children International Chief Executive Officer Jasmine Whitbread. “The innocence of childhood has been replaced by the cruel realities of trying to survive.”  Interviews with children suggest they’re being deliberately targeted, and an entire generation risks being scarred for life, according to the report. They are missing out on education, and while health risks, including malnutrition, disease and trauma grow, their access to health care is being reduced, it said.  At least 2,000 schools have been damaged during the two years of fighting, which has claimed as many as 70,000 lives, the London-based charity said. Two-thirds of children surveyed said they had been in a terrifying situation and one in three said they had been hit, kicked, or shot at, it said, citing research from Bahcesehir University in  Turkey .  Emotional Scars  Many children are showing signs of emotional difficulties, the organization said. About a third of children questioned said they had been separated from family members, while three quarters said a close friend or relative had died.  The number of children killed in the fighting, which has developed along sectarian lines, isn’t known as gathering of comprehensive and definitive date is difficult, the group said. Hospitals report a rising number being admitted with burns, gunshot wounds or injuries from explosions, it said.  Armed groups are also using boys under 18 years old as runners or informers, while others, as young as eight years-old are being used as human shields, according to the report. Families are marrying girls off early in a bid to protect them from a perceived threat of sexual violence.  Half of the one million Syrian refugees living abroad are children, Save the Children said, many of whom are separated from one or both of their parents. It called on the  United Nations Security Council  to overcome divisions and urgently unite to end the war.
