International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)  shares reached an all-time high, valuing the world’s
largest provider of computer services at $236.3 billion.  IBM gained 0.7 percent to $212.06 today in New York, the
highest level on record. Shares of the Armonk, New York-based
company have climbed 11 percent this year.  The company has propelled its stock price by boosting
 earnings  per share, divesting underperforming units and moving
into higher-margin software businesses such as data analysis.
IBM has said it will deliver at least $20 in earnings per share
in 2015, compared with $15.25 last year. It also has set aside
$50 billion for share repurchases and $20 billion for  dividends 
between the end of 2010 and 2015.  IBM last reached a record closing high of $211 on Oct. 16.
After the markets closed that day, IBM reported third-quarter
revenue that fell short of analysts’ estimates, causing the
shares to slump for the next month.  Even with the recent gains, the shares trade at a 10
percent  price-to-earnings discount  to the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index. IBM has a PE ratio of 13.9, compared with 15 for the  S&P
500 information-technology index , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  In the past month, IBM has said its data-analysis business
will perform better than expected, adding $20 billion in revenue
in 2015. That compares with an earlier goal of $16 billion. The
company also said it will double investment in mobile
technologies this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
