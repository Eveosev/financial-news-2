Turkey ’s currency depreciated for a
second day against the dollar after the central bank signaled it
would maintain monetary loosening.  The lira headed for its weakest since Oct. 10 after
Governor Erdem Basci said the right policy stance for Turkey is
a combination of low  interest rates  and balanced growth,
according to an e-mailed statement from the central bank.  Turkey’s central bank reduced overnight borrowing rates by
50 basis points this year, citing accelerating capital inflows,
saying it would not allow an overvalued lira to threaten the
country’s financial stability.  “The lira is weakening because the central bank has given
the message that it will continue to reduce interest rates,”
Ugur Kucuk, a fixed-income strategist at Is Investment
Securities in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments. “No one will
buy short-term debt as there are expectations of further lira
depreciation, and yields will rise more.”  The lira retreated 0.5 percent to 1.8127 per dollar at 5:10
p.m. in Istanbul, extending its loss this month to 0.8 percent.
Yields on two-year benchmark bonds rose two basis points to 5.83
percent.  Benchmark yields climbed 14 basis points this month, paring
this year’s decline to 32 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
