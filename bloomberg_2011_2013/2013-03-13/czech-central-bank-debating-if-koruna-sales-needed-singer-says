The Czech central bank is debating
whether to loosen conditions by selling the koruna in the second
half of the year, Governor Miroslav Singer said.  While the bank expects the economy to start recovering this
year from its  longest recession  on record, the Ceska Narodni
Banka’s forecasts imply that a weaker koruna may be needed,
Singer told the Nordic Chamber of Commerce in  Prague  today. The
currency fell against the euro after the comments.  “We’re talking about the likelihood of having to intervene
in the second half of the year,” Singer said. To meet the CNB’s
forecasts for market interest rates, “we may need, in the
second half, a slightly weaker  exchange rate .”  The $217 billion economy contracted for each of the past
four quarters as the government’s austerity program prompted
households and companies to spend less while the euro area’s
debt crisis damped demand for Czech exports.  The koruna has weakened 0.8 percent this week against the
euro after data published on March 11 showed the Czech inflation
rate slowed in February more than the analysts and the central
bank forecast. It traded at 25.640 per euro at 5:53 p.m. in
Prague, down 0.1 percent on the day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
