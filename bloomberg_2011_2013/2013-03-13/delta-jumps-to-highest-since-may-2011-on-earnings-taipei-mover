Delta Electronics Inc. (2308)  surged to an
almost two-year high in Taipei trading after earnings beat
analyst estimates and Credit Suisse Group AG and Macquarie Group
Ltd. recommended buying the shares.  Delta, a maker of power-supply packs for notebook
computers, jumped 6.7 percent to NT$119 as of 9:13 a.m. local
time, poised for the highest close since May 16, 2011. The
benchmark Taiex index advanced 0.5 percent to 8,036.09.  The company reported  net income  of NT$3.75 billion ($126
million) in the fourth quarter, higher than the median estimate
of NT$3.55 billion of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Credit Suisse  raised  the company to outperform from
neutral, saying operating margins are rising while an
“improving product mix,” productivity gains and increased
automation will help it offset price pressure from customers.
Macquarie upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral.  An outperform rating means the brokerage expects the
stock’s return to exceed the average among its peers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
