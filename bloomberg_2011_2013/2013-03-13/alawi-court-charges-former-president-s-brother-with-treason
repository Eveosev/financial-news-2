The brother of former Malawian
President Bingu wa Mutharika was charged with treason in
connection with an attempt to install the military after the
leader’s death last year.  Peter wa Mutharika’s case has been sent to the  High Court ,
Magistrate Agnes Chinangwe said today in Lilongwe, the capital.
He was charged with six counts, including treason and mutiny.  A commission of inquiry released a 90-page report in
January that found wa Mutharika and other Democratic Progressive
Party officials considered blocking the appointment of the
country’s deputy leader, Joyce Banda, as president after Bingu’s
death on April 5. Wa Mutharika was arrested on March 11, along
with six others.  Banda became president on April 7 in the southern African
nation,  Africa ’s biggest exporter of the burley variety of
tobacco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
