U.K. stocks fell, snapping four
days of gains, as a report showed euro-area industrial output
fell more than expected in January.  G4S Plc (GFS)  lost 1.8 percent after posting 2012 profit that
missed analysts’ estimates.  Balfour Beatty Plc (BBY)  fell 2.1 percent
after the stock was downgraded at HSBC Holdings Plc. Prudential
Plc jumped to the highest price in 12 years after raising its
dividend.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  dropped 46.14 points, or 0.7 percent, to
6,464.48 at 10:15 a.m. in  London . Six companies on the benchmark
gauge trade ex-dividend today, wiping about 10.8 points of the
measure. The broader FTSE All-Share Index lost 0.7 percent
today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index fell 0.2 percent.  Euro-area industrial production dropped 0.4 percent in
January, after increasing a revised 0.9 percent in December, a
report showed today. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of 32 economists had called for a 0.1 percent decline in
the first month of 2013.  U.S. data today may show sales at U.S. retailers climbed
0.5 percent in February for a fourth months of gains, according
to the median economist forecast in a Bloomberg Survey. That
would follow a 0.1 percent gain in January. The Commerce
Department releases the  figures  at 8:30 a.m. Washington time.  G4S Earnings  G4S slid 1.8 percent to 302.1 pence. The world’s largest
security company reported 2012 profit of 48 million pounds,
missing analysts’ estimates of 178 million pounds. Full-year
sales stood at 7.5 billion pounds, trailing analysts’
projections for 8.02 billion pounds.  Balfour Beatty, the U.K.’s largest construction company
fell 2.1 percent to 266.3 pence. The stock was downgraded to
neutral from overweight at HSBC, which said the outlook for the
construction business is tougher than anticipated.  Prudential (PRU)  rose 2.8 percent to 1,058 pence, the highest
price since January 2001. The U.K.’s biggest insurer by market
value raised its  dividend  16 percent as 2012 operating profit
beat estimates.  The full-year payout increased to 29.19 pence a share in
2012, compared with 25.19 pence a share a year earlier, the
London-based firm said. That beat the 26.5 pence a share median
estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Thomas Cook Plc surged 11 percent to 96.75 pence. The 171-
year-old U.K. tour operator said it will raise as much as 150
million pounds from disposals and is increasing cost cuts to
achieve profitability targets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
