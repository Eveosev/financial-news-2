Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN) , the most
valuable online-travel agency, said the $1.8 billion purchase of
 Kayak Software Corp. (KYAK)  will close later than expected because of
an antitrust review by U.K. regulators.  The U.K. Office of Fair Trading has a May deadline for its
examination of the merger, the Norwalk, Connecticut-based
company said in a statement today. The deal was originally
expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2013.  Priceline has been using acquisitions to add customers as
it works to grow sales and fend off competition in a sluggish
economy. Kayak, which raised $91 million in an initial public
offering in July, lets travelers compare prices and make
reservations for hotels, flights, cars and vacations.  Last month, Priceline said it was in the process of
obtaining approval from European regulators and expected a vote
on the transaction at a Kayak shareholder meeting planned for
March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
