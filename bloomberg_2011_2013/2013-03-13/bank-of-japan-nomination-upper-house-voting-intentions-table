Japan’s upper house of parliament votes March 15
on the government’s nomination for Bank of Japan governor and two deputy
governors. The lower house, where the ruling coalition has about a two-thirds
majority, votes March 14.             A nominee needs 118 votes to pass the upper house. Haruhiko Kuroda, the
Asian Development Bank president, is the nominee for governor. Hiroshi Nakaso,
a career BOJ staffer and current executive director, is the candidate for one
deputy job and Kikuo Iwata, a long-time critic of the bank who advocates
greater stimulus, the other.
