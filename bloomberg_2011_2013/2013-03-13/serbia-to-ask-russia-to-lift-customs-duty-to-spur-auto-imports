Serbia will ask Russia to allow
tens of thousands of cars made in the Balkan country to be
imported without a customs duty of as much as 30 percent.  Cars weren’t included in a free-trade agreement the two
countries signed in 2000 and Serbia hopes to change it to
support its auto industry, including  Fiat SpA (F) ’s Serbian plant
and some 150 local suppliers, Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic
told a business forum in Kopaonik, Serbia, today. Serbian
officials will hold talks in Moscow on April 10-11 on the issue,
he said.  “We’ll try to negotiate quotas, starting maybe with a few
tens of thousands of cars a year” to be sold customs-free, he
said. If an agreement is reached, Serbia may seek a gradual
increase to “possibly 50,000, maybe 80,000 units or more.”  Fiat Automobili Srbija, a joint  venture  between the
government and Italian carmaker Fiat, is Serbia’s sole
automaker, “but an agreement with Russia would be very
beneficial for other investors and for those who are considering
coming to Serbia,” Dinkic said.  With the current customs, vehicles made in Serbia are “not
sellable in Russia from the economic standpoint,” said Antonio
Ferrara, the head of the Fiat venture in Serbia.  The plant producing 500L compact wagons already makes some
units for the Russian market, but “volumes are completely
different” under customs-free conditions, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
