Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  reached a
$17.5 million settlement with Massachusetts regulators who said
the firm’s employees didn’t disclose conflicts of interest tied
to collateralized debt obligations before the financial crisis.  The bank’s securities unit failed to ensure that buyers of
a CDO known as Carina knew a proprietary trading group at the
firm and a hedge fund had played a role in structuring the
product in 2006, Secretary of the Commonwealth  William Galvin 
said today in a consent order. The group and fund intended to
bet against part of the CDO or similar debt, he said. Galvin
faulted the bank’s unit, known as DBSI, for supervisory lapses.  “Unless DBSI had disclosed these conflicts of interest,
investors could not have known of them and would not have
invested in Carina,” Galvin’s office wrote in the  order . “In
less than one year, rating agencies downgraded Carina’s notes to
junk status, resulting in substantial losses.”  The bank didn’t admit or deny violating laws, the order
shows.  “We are pleased to have reached this  settlement  and put
this matter behind us,” said  Renee Calabro , a spokeswoman for
the Frankfurt-based bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
