Millwall defeated Blackburn 1-0 in
a replay to reach the semifinals of English soccer’s F.A. Cup
for the first time in nine years.  Danny Shittu headed in a corner kick three minutes before
halftime at Blackburn’s  Ewood Park  to give the Lions the win in
the quarterfinal matchup of teams from the second-tier
Championship. The replay was needed after a 0-0 draw in London
three days ago.  Millwall will face Wigan of the Premier League at Wembley
Stadium on April 13 or 14. The Lions last reached the semifinals
in 2004, when they beat Sunderland 1-0 before losing the title
match to  Manchester United .  The other semifinal will pit Manchester City against
defending champion Chelsea or record 11-time winner United, who
will replay their quarterfinal April 1 after drawing 2-2 at Old
Trafford last weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
