New Zealand’s dollar dropped to the
weakest level this year after its central bank said the
currency’s strength may prompt it to lower benchmark borrowing
costs to help the economy cope with a drought.  The so-called kiwi tumbled by more than one U.S. cent after
the Reserve Bank of New Zealand held rates unchanged at 2.5
percent and said it expects to keep record-low borrowing costs
until next year. Swaps traders had been pricing in a 23 basis-
point increase over 12 months, according to a Credit Suisse
Group AG  index  based on swaps.  “The RBNZ has taken a swipe at the market’s pricing in of
hikes for this year,” said Mike Jones, a currency strategist at
Bank of New Zealand in Wellington. “Not only is the bank trying
to guide the market toward a later start to its hiking cycle,
but there’s a thinly veiled threat in the statement about
cutting rates if the kiwi refuses to fall. So the kiwi has
suffered from a double whammy of sliding interest rates and
jawboning.”  The New Zealand dollar traded at 81.80 U.S. cents as of
7:56 a.m. in Sydney after falling as low as 81.62, the least
since Dec. 26, from 82.68 just before the decision. It bought
78.60 yen.  The kiwi slid to NZ$1.2605 against the Australian dollar,
the weakest level since Jan. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
