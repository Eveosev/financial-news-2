U.S. ethanol output fell 1 percent
to 797,000 barrels a day last week, the U.S. Energy Information
Administration said.  Production dropped a second week for the first consecutive
seven-day decline since Dec. 14. The level for the week ended
March 8 was the lowest since Feb. 15, the Energy Department’s
analytical arm said in a report today.  Stockpiles slid to 18.7 million barrels, the least since
Nov. 16, declining for a sixth straight week. That was longest
set of inventory drops since the EIA began tracking weekly data
for the biofuel in June 2010.  The country didn’t  import  any of the fuel for a second
week, the first time that’s happened since June, EIA data show.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 93 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool, down from 94 percent last week.  Denatured ethanol for April delivery slipped 2.1 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $2.513 a gallon at 10:16 a.m. local time on the
Chicago Board of Trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
