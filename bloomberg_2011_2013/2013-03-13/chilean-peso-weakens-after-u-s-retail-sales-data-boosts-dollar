Chile’s peso depreciated as the
dollar rallied after data showed U.S. retail sales rose the most
in five months.  The Andean nation’s currency depreciated 0.1 percent to
471.2 per dollar at the close of trading in Santiago. It has
gained 1.7 percent this year.  The peso touched 470.42 per dollar before the Commerce
Department reported a 1.1 percent increase in sales from U.S.
retailers that beat all projections of economists  surveyed by
Bloomberg . The dollar gained against most of its major peers and
the euro sank after the data fueled confidence in the  U.S.
economy . The euro, which traders in Chile regard as a barometer
for the dollar, slid to the lowest since December.  “We’re buying dollars,” said Cristian Donoso, a currency
trader at Banchile Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago. “The
peso is in the same range, every time it strengthens people
worry about intervention and it weakens again.”  The peso has traded between 470 and 476 per dollar for most
of the year, and hasn’t broken through 470 since Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
