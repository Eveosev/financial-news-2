U.S. Ambassador to Italy David
Thorne urged an assembly of high-school students in  Rome  to
emulate the upstart political movement of ex-comic Beppe Grillo
and push to create a society where merit is rewarded.  “I know there’s a problem with meritocracy,” Thorne said
today, according to a  video  posted on the Internet. “But you
can take control of your country and act like the Five Star
Movement, push for reforms and change.”  Thorne held Five Star up as a model for Italy after the
performance of Grillo’s party in February elections upended the
balance of power in parliament. Five Star, which garnered about
a quarter of the votes by promising to sweep established
politicians from power, is among the four main parliamentary
forces negotiating to form  Italy ’s next government.  “You are the future of Italy and it’s up to you at this
time to act for your country,” Thorne said in the address to
students.  A spokesman for the Democratic Party, whose leader Luigi Bersani won a majority in the lower house, criticized the
comments by Thorne.  “The one thing we don’t need are frankly inappropriate
comments, even if made by friends of our country like those
today by the American ambassador,” Lapo Pistelli, a party
spokesman for foreign affairs, said in an e-mailed statement.  “The embassy doesn’t support any political force,” the
U.S. embassy said today in a Twitter Inc. posting. “It talks
with all and promotes the use of social media as a tool for
change.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
