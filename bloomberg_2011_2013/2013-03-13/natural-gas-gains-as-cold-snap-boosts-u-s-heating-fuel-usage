Natural gas futures climbed in New
York for the fourth time in five days, reaching a three-month
high, on speculation that unusually cold weather heading into
spring will spur heating demand.  Gas gained as much as 1.4 percent as Commodity Weather
Group LLC predicted below-normal temperatures sweeping from the
Dakotas into the Northeast from March 23 through March 27. The
government tomorrow may report an above-average  stockpile  drop
because of cold weather last week, analyst estimates show.  “The cold temperatures, especially in the Midwest, are
giving this market a boost,” said Phil Flynn, senior market
analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “I’m expecting an
above-average drawdown and the cold temperatures are adding to
demand.”  Natural gas for April delivery rose 4.3 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $3.688 per million British thermal units at 1:05
p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange after rising to $3.696,
the highest intraday price since Dec. 6. Trading volume was 18
percent below the 100-day average for the time of day. Prices
have climbed 10 percent this year.  The discount of April contracts to October, a gauge of
summer demand for gas, narrowed 0.7 cent to 17.2 cents, the
smallest gap since Nov. 28. The discount over the past month has
been at its smallest compared with any April-October spread for
the same period going back to 2004.  June $4.55 calls were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They rose 0.2 cent to 1.7 cents per million
Btu on volume of 1,620 contracts as of 1:08 p.m. Calls accounted
for 54 percent of options volume.  Implied volatility for at-the-money gas options expiring in
April was 33.43 percent, up from 33.32 percent yesterday. May
options volatility was 30.62 percent, up from 30.39 percent.  Options Trading  The low temperature in Chicago on March 26 may be 31
degrees Fahrenheit (minus 1 Celsius), three lower than the usual
reading, according to AccuWeather Inc. in State College,
 Pennsylvania . Washington’s low may be 5 below normal at 35
degrees.  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to the Energy Information Administration, a division
of the Energy Department. Gas demand typically slumps between
the peak heating-demand season and before hot weather drives
power demand to run air conditioners.  Output from U.S. nuclear plants fell 1.3 percent to 83,334
megawatts today, or 82 percent of capacity, the least since Dec.
1, according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data compiled
by Bloomberg. Production has fallen 13 percent from this year’s
high reached on Feb. 1.  Nuclear Plants  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall, when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  Gas inventories  probably fell by 136 billion cubic feet in
the week ended March 8, based on the median of 12 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year average drop from
the week is 74 billion, according to the EIA. Supplies dropped
66 billion a year earlier as an unusually mild winter  reduced
demand  for the fuel.  U.S. stockpiles totaled 2.083 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended March 1, 14.8 percent below year-earlier levels, the
 biggest deficit  since July 2008, the EIA reported last week. A
 supply surplus  to the five-year average narrowed to 14.8 percent
from 16 percent.  The U.S. lowered its forecast for natural gas output in
2013 by 0.6 percent and decreased its outlook for prices in a
report yesterday.  Production Estimate  Marketed gas production will average a record 69.6 billion
cubic feet a day this year, down from 70.02 billion estimated in
February, the Energy Information Administration said in its
monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook , released yesterday in
 Washington . Output will rise 0.7 percent from 2012.  Cold weather has reduced output during the winter as water
produced with gas crystallizes and blocks flows from wells.  “As natural gas production in the United States shifts
inland, well freeze-offs have become a greater supply disruption
risk during the winter,” the EIA said in the report.  Gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,  Louisiana ,
will average $3.41 per million British thermal units, lower than
the previous estimate of $3.53, according to the EIA report.  The forecast for total gas consumption fell to 70.02
billion cubic feet a day from 70.31 billion. Rising prices will
curtail gas use for power generation, the agency said.  Inventories of the fuel may be “just under” 2 trillion
cubic feet at the end of March, compared with 2.477 trillion for
the same period last year, according to the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
