Italian bonds fell, with two-year
yields rising the most in two weeks, as borrowing costs
increased at an auction amid concern a political deadlock will
derail plans to fix the nation’s finances.  Shorter-maturity notes led declines as the country sold
3.32 billion euros ($4.3 billion) of securities due in December
2015 at an average yield of 2.48 percent versus 2.30 percent at
the previous offering last month.  Spain ’s 10-year bonds snapped
a 10-day rally. Ireland’s bonds rose even as the nation sold
about 5 billion euros of securities through banks in its first
10-year debt issuance since a 2010 bailout.  “The market is a bit complacent about the risks that can
happen in  Italy ,” said Mohit Kumar, head of Europe and U.K.
rates strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in  London . “If you have a
government that is unable to pursue structural reforms, it will
have an impact on economic growth in Italy.”  Italy’s two-year yield rose 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 1.87 percent at 4:40 p.m. London time,
after increasing as much as 14 basis points, the most since Feb.
26. The 6 percent note due November 2014 declined 0.21, or 2.10
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 106.725. The 10-year bond
yield climbed seven basis points to 4.67 percent.  The Rome-based Treasury also allotted 2 billion euros of
securities maturing in 2028 at 4.90 percent compared with 4.805
percent when they were sold via banks on Jan. 15. The bond
auctions were the first since the nation’s debt was downgraded
by  Fitch Ratings  on March 8.  Below Target  Italy also sold 2017 and 2018 floating-rate notes, pushing
total sales to 6.99 billion euros today, less than the 7.25
billion-euros target.  The rate on Spanish 10-year bonds climbed four basis points
to 4.77 percent.  Italy’s government bond yields have increased since
elections on Feb. 24-25 failed to provide a clear winner,
threatening political paralysis that may derail outgoing Prime
Minister  Mario Monti ’s austerity program. Fitch lowered Italy’s
credit rating one level to BBB+, saying the political deadlock
would make it harder for the government to respond to recession.  Italian and Spanish bonds also fell as industrial
production in the euro area dropped more than economists
forecast.  Factory production slipped 0.4 percent in January from
December, when it rose a revised 0.9 percent, the European
Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today. The median
forecast in a  Bloomberg News survey  of 32 economists was for a
0.1 percent decline.  Irish Sale  Ireland’s new bond was sold at a yield of about 4.15
percent, Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  told reporters in
Dublin today, saying the country received more than 400 separate
offers from investors.  “Ireland coming to market is a further step toward a
normalization of the  bond market ,” said Mark Dowding, a London-
based senior fixed-income manager at BlueBay Asset Management,
which oversees about $50 billion including Irish bonds. “It may
pave the way for a credit-rating upgrade and can be seen in a
positive light.”  The yield on Ireland’s 5 percent bond maturing in October
2020 fell one basis point to 3.65 percent.  Germany  sold an additional 4.32 billion euros of two-year
notes at an average yield of 0.06 percent, down from 0.21
percent at a Feb. 13 auction. That compares with a  record-low 
auction yield of minus 0.06 percent set on July 18.  Benchmark 10-year bund yields were little changed at 1.48
percent.  Volatility on Italian bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Finland and Spain, according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Italian bonds returned 0.3 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Germany’s
bunds handed investors a loss of 0.7 percent and Spanish
securities gained 4.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
