The  bond market  could help smaller
U.K. technology companies grow and develop their products,
rather than being forced to sell themselves to larger overseas
businesses, a panel of lawmakers said.  The government doesn’t have a strategy for helping
scientists make successful businesses out of their innovations,
Parliament’s  Science and Technology Committee  said in a report
published in  London  today titled “Bridging the Valley of
Death.” Pension funds no longer invest in risky business
startups because of regulation, leading to a lack of sources of
capital, the panel said.  The committee urged the government to use the Business Bank
it’s currently setting up to promote a bond market for medium-
sized companies.  “Equity investments have a place, but too many companies
are forced into overreliance on this route because other types
of funding are unavailable,” the committee’s chairman,  Andrew Miller  from the opposition  Labour Party , said in an e-mailed
statement. “British entrepreneurs are being badly let down by a
lack of access to financial support and a system that often
forces them to sell out to private-equity investors or larger
foreign companies to get ideas off the ground.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
