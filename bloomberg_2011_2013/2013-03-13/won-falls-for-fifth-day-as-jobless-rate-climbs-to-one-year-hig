The won dropped for a fifth day,
the longest run of declines in 10 months, after South Korea’s
 unemployment rate  unexpectedly climbed to the highest in a year.
 Government bonds  advanced.  The nation’s unemployment rate climbed to 3.5 percent in
February, a government report showed today, more than the 3.2
percent median estimate of 13 economists in a Bloomberg survey.
South Korea’s import prices gained 2.7 percent last month from
January, according to a separate report from the central bank.
Twelve out of 16 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg predict the
Bank of Korea will keep  interest rates  steady at a review
tomorrow.  The “unemployment rate unexpectedly jumped to 3.5 percent
from 3.2 percent, and the breakdown of the data was quite
negative, which could revive rate-cut hopes,” Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit Agricole CIB,
said in a note today. The report “will weigh on the Korean won
as a decline in payrolls and higher unemployment are negative
for growth,” he wrote.  The won declined 0.1 percent to 1,096.72 per dollar as of
10:12 a.m. in  Seoul , after falling as much as 0.3 percent
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
touched 1,102.65 on March 11, the weakest level since October,
and its five-day losing streak is the longest since May 16. One-
month implied volatility for the won, a measure of expected
moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.84 percent.  The sale of dollars by exporters is limiting declines in
the won, said Son Eun Jeong, an analyst at Woori Futures Co. in
Seoul.  The yield on the 2.75 percent bonds due December 2015 fell
one basis point to 2.61 percent, according to prices from Korea
