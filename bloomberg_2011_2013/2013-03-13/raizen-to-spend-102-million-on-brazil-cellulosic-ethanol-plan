Raizen Energia SA, a Brazilian
joint venture of  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Cosan SA Industria &
Commercio (CSAN3) , will invest 200 million reais ($102 million) in a
plant that will produce ethanol from sugar-cane residues.  The plant will be attached to its Costa Pinto cane mill in
the southeastern city of Piracicaba and have capacity to produce
40 million liters of fuel a year, a press official for Raizen
who didn’t want to be named because of company policy, said
today in an e-mail. It may begin production next year.  Raizen, based in Barra Bonita, Brazil, plans to build eight
additional cellulosic-ethanol plants through 2024. The company
already makes ethanol from cane juice and using the crushed
stalks and leaves will let it produce 50 percent more fuel from
the same land, according to Raizen.  Shell has been researching the technology with Canada’s
Iogen Corp. and U.S. company  Codexis Inc. (CDXS)   To contact the reporter on this story:
