David Wright  drove in five runs and
Gio Gonzalez pitched five scoreless innings as the U.S. beat
Puerto Rico 7-1 in the second round of the World Baseball
Classic.  The U.S. scored runs in the first, third, fifth and seventh
innings before Wright hit a bases-loaded double in the eighth at
Marlins Park in Miami.  The U.S. will play tomorrow against the Dominican Republic,
which remained unbeaten in the WBC by rallying past Italy 5-4
last night.  In the other game yesterday, defending champion Japan
defeated the Netherlands 10-6 at Tokyo Dome in Tokyo.  Japan and the Netherlands both advanced to the semifinals
at AT&T Park in  San Francisco , which will host the championship
on March 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
