Banro Corp. (BAA) , the Canadian gold
miner whose chief executive officer stepped down last week, said
acting Chief Operating Officer Colin Belshaw has also departed.  Belshaw left “in the last month,” Naomi Nemeth, a
spokeswoman for Banro said today by phone. The Toronto-based
company isn’t looking for a replacement right now, she said.
Nemeth declined to comment on the reasons for Belshaw’s
departure because they are confidential.  Banro, which operates in the  Democratic Republic  of Congo,
fell 22 percent on March 7, a day after it announced  John Clarke 
as interim CEO, replacing Simon Village. The start of production
at the company’s Namoya project in Congo has been delayed and
the construction cost overrun is estimated at 15 percent because
of unseasonably heavy rains, Banro said March 7.  Banro declined 1.5 percent to C$2.01 at 12:40 p.m. in
Toronto. The shares have fallen 28 percent this year, compared
with a 17 percent drop in the 55-member Standard & Poor’s/TSX
Global Gold Sector Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
