Kerry Properties Ltd. (683) , the
developer controlled by Malaysian billionaire  Robert Kuok , paid
HK$11.7 billion ($1.5 billion) for a residential property in
Hong Kong.  The Hong Kong-based builder won the 1.13 million square-
foot site in a tender, the government said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. The price paid was equivalent to about
HK$10,200 a square foot, according to calculations by Centaline
Property Agency Ltd., the city’s biggest closely held realtor.  The site was the first sold by the Hong Kong government
since it imposed its toughest measures yet to curb  home prices 
that have doubled since early 2009. Chief Executive Leung Chun-
ying, who took over in July, on Feb. 22 doubled stamp duties on
all property transactions that exceed HK$2 million and raised
mortgage downpayment requirement on some purchases.  Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd. (1) , controlled by Hong Kong’s
richest man Li Ka-shing, will cut prices of new apartments at
one of its projects in the city by as much as 11 percent, it
said last week.  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16) , the world’s biggest
developer, on Feb. 28 cut its home sales target for the fiscal
year ending June by 8.6 percent to HK$32 billion. New World
Development Co., controlled by billionaire  Cheng Yu-tung , also
lowered its sales target in response to the government curbs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
