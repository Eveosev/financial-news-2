Grupo Pao de Acucar , Brazil’s biggest retailer, rose to a record
high as  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  recommended buying the stock,
citing expansion of small neighborhood stores.  Shares (PCAR4)  increased 3.9 percent to 107.87 reais at 2:34 p.m.
in Sao Paulo. A close at that level would be the highest since
October 1995, when the stock started trading. The benchmark
Bovespa index fell 0.3 percent.  JPMorgan raised its recommendation on the stock to the
equivalent of buy from hold as Pao de Acucar accelerated the
expansion of its high-return neighborhood minimarkets, increased
margins on its electronics unit and enhanced corporate
governance by appointing new board members.  Those changes signal the beginning of a “virtuous cycle”
and will help sales grow 11 percent this year, Andrea Teixeira
and Pedro Leduc, analysts at JPMorgan, wrote in a research note
to clients today.  Pao de Acucar advanced 15 percent this year through
yesterday while the Bovespa slid 4.5 percent during the same
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
