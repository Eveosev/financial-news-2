The first retreat in Chinese zinc
output in three decades and record global demand are spurring
Morgan Stanley to predict the end of a six-year glut.  Consumption will outpace supply of refined metal by about
100,000 metric tons in 2013, equal to what the U.S. consumes in
a month, with at least four more years of deficits, the bank
estimates. Zinc will rally as much as 19 percent to $2,350 a ton
by the end of December, according to the median of 11 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Prices that fell 57 percent from a record in November 2006
drove refiners in  China , the biggest producer, to cut annual
output for the first time since 1983. Supply is declining just
as steelmakers, the largest users, expand steel smelting at
three times last year’s pace. While zinc stockpiles are near
their highest in two decades, about 60 percent of the metal may
be tied up in financial transactions and unavailable to
consumers, Societe Generale SA estimates.  “All of the signs to me are that demand is improving,”
said  Peter Richardson , the chief metals economist at Morgan
Stanley in  Melbourne  who has tracked metals for a quarter
century. “Supply in the form of inventory availability is
restrained and likely to become more restrained.”  Zinc fell 4.7 percent to $1,981.75 this year on the London
Metal Exchange as the bourse’s LMEX Index of six metals dropped
2.7 percent. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities
gained 0.4 percent and the  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD)  of
equities gained 6.3 percent. Treasuries lost 0.6 percent, a Bank
of America Corp. index shows.  Chinese Output  Refined supply declined 3.5 percent to 12.66 million tons
last year, as Chinese output retreated 7.5 percent to 4.83
million tons, according to the Lisbon-based International Lead &
Zinc Study  Group . Consumption dropped 2.8 percent.  Production will rebound 5.6 percent to 13.59 million tons
this year, as demand surges 9.6 percent to 13.59 million tons,
Morgan Stanley estimates.  Supply is also constrained because so much is locked up in
warehouses and can’t trade freely. Stockpiles monitored by the
LME jumped 39 percent to 1.21 million tons in the past year. As
much as 60 percent of stockpiled metal may be tied into
financing deals, according to  Societe Generale , which expects a
supply deficit of 270,000 tons this year.  The transactions typically involve a simultaneous purchase
of metal for nearby delivery and a forward sale to take
advantage of a market in contango, when contracts with later
delivery months cost more than nearer-dated metal. Zinc for
delivery in June 2014 is trading at a 4.2 percent premium to
this month on the LME.  Canceled Warrants  Orders to remove zinc from warehouses, measured through so-
called canceled warrants, now represent 49 percent of inventory,
from 2.1 percent a year ago, data from the LME show. Stored
 metal  tracked by the Shanghai Futures Exchange is already 15
percent lower than a year ago, according to the bourse.  About 50 percent of zinc is used to rust-proof steel, 17
percent goes into brass and bronze and the same amount into die-
cast products from bathroom fixtures to car parts, data compiled
by Bloomberg Industries show. Global steel output will advance
4.7 percent to a record 1.62 billion tons this year, from growth
of 1.4 percent in 2012, according to MEPS (International) Ltd.,
a Sheffield, England-based industry consultant.  Slowing Economies  Any turnaround in the zinc market, where prices have
dropped in four of the past six years, may be undermined by
signs of slowing economies, with the 17-nation euro region
already back in recession.  Europe  accounts for 18 percent of
zinc demand, according to Barclays Plc. While the  International
Monetary Fund  expects global economic growth of 3.5 percent this
year, from 3.2 percent in 2012, the Washington-based group cut
its estimate three times since July.  Barclays says the surplus will decline to 273,000 tons this
year, from 338,000 tons in 2012. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
in January the glut would narrow 54 percent to 181,000 tons in
2013 and this month projected a price of $2,100 in 12 months, or
6.1 percent more than now. Gains in Chinese production should
offset growth in demand, the bank said.  As refiners curbed supply last year, mines produced 5.1
percent more, according to the study group. Mines will expand
another 6.7 percent this year, Morgan Stanley estimates.  Ore Available  There is ample ore available to increase refined output at
the right price, Macquarie Group Ltd. said in a report Feb. 25.
Chinese zinc production reached a record 479,983 tons in
December, after futures rebounded 9.4 percent in November,
Beijing Antaike Information & Technology Co. estimates. The
average Chinese smelter needs $2,500 to break even, or 26
percent more than now, according to Liu Mengluan, an analyst at
the state-backed research company.  The predicted rally in prices comes as  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  closes
its Brunswick mine in  Canada  this month, an operation which
yielded 2.9 million tons of ore last year. About 841,000 tons of
mine output will be lost by 2014 as Xstrata also shuts the
Perseverance mine in Canada and  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  closes
Lisheen in Ireland, said Kenneth Hoffman, an analyst at
Bloomberg Industries in Skillman,  New Jersey . The total will
rise to 2 million tons by 2017, he said.  Global car sales will advance 2.4 percent to 82.7 million
units this year, according to LMC Automotive Ltd., a research
company based in Oxford,  England . About 17 pounds of zinc are
used to protect the average vehicle from  rust , 20 pounds goes
into parts including handles and locks, and each tire contains
about half a pound of the metal, according to the American
Galvanizers Association.  Roads, Railways  Demand in China, which consumes 45 percent of supply, will
rise 13 percent to 6.07 million tons this year, Morgan Stanley
estimates. The nation’s government said March 5 it planned to
open 5,200 kilometers (3,200 miles) of new railway lines and
build 80,000 kilometers of highways, boosting demand for steel.
Urbanization will bolster metals demand,  Jiangxi Copper Co. (358) , the
country’s largest producer, said the same day.  “China’s appetite for zinc will continue to increase this
year for infrastructure,”  Tetsu Emori , the chief  fund manager 
at Astmax Investment Management Inc. in  Tokyo , which manages
about $760 million of assets. “Economies in the U.S. and Europe
will gradually be improving this year, supporting demand
prospects for industrial metals.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
