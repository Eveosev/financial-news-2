Silver Spring  Networks Inc., the
maker of networking equipment for smart electricity grids,
surged in its first day of trading after raising 21 percent more
than planned in a U.S. initial public offering.  The  stock  rose 29 percent to $22 at the close in New York.
 Redwood City , California-based Silver Spring yesterday raised
$80.8 million selling 4.75 million shares for $17 each. The
company had offered 3.71 million shares, equivalent to an 8.4
percent stake, for $16 to $18 apiece.  Silver Springâ€™s offering attracted higher-than-expected
demand as U.S. IPOs have raised $6.6 billion this year, more
than double the amount in the year-earlier period, and the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  has risen to record levels this month.
The company planned to raise an additional $12 million in a
private placement with venture-capital firm Foundation Capital,
its biggest shareholder, filings show.  Revenue (SSNI)  at the power-grid networking company declined 17
percent to $196.7 million in the 12 months through December
compared with the previous year, regulatory filings show. It
recorded a net loss of $89.7 million, narrower than the $92.4
million loss a year earlier.  The company was founded in 2002 and provides customers with
hardware and software that enable power providers to offer
flexible pricing and monitor the health of power grids. Sales
have withered partly because of slow adoption of smart-grid
technology, caused by uncertainty over the timing of U.S.
stimulus spending and regulatory investigations, the  filings 
show.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG led the
IPO. The stock is listed on the  New York  Stock Exchange under
SSNI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
