McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the largest
restaurant chain by sales, will next month begin selling an egg-
white breakfast sandwich at all U.S. locations to help boost
 sales .  The chain will roll out the new 250-calorie Egg McMuffin on
April 22, Ofelia Casillas, a spokeswoman for the Oak Brook,
Illinois-based company, said in an e-mail. An egg sandwich with
yolk has 300 calories. McDonald’s is making efforts to promote
healthier food at its stores as U.S. consumers demand more
nutritious fare. Last year, the chain began advertising a
“Favorites Under 400 Calories” menu.  The Big Mac seller is also facing more competition from
 Burger King Worldwide Inc. (BKW)  and  Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) ’s Taco Bell
chain. Sales at U.S. McDonald’s stores open at least 13 months
fell 3.3 percent last month, the company said on March 8.  McDonald’s has been trying to attract Americans with new
menu items, such as Fish McBites and chicken wings. Later this
month the company will introduce new wraps including sweet chili
chicken and chicken and bacon. The fast-food chain will also
begin selling a blueberry pomegranate-flavored smoothie on May
15, Casillas said.  McDonald’s  shares  advanced 13 percent this year through
yesterday, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has gained 9
percent.  The company has about 14,000 U.S. stores.  To contact the reporter on this story:
