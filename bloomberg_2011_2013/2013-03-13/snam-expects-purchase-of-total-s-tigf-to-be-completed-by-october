Snam SpA (SRG) , owner of Italy’s biggest
natural-gas network, expects to close the purchase of a stake in
 Total SA (FP) ’s TIGF by October after European Union and antitrust
approvals, Chief Executive Officer Carlo Malacarne said.  “TIGF is important,” he said today after a presentation
in London.  Total entered exclusive talks to sell the gas network in
southwestern France to Snam, Electricite de France SA and
Government of Singapore Investment Corp. for 2.4 billion euros
($3.1 billion), it said last month. Snam’s share is 45 percent,
Singapore’s state investor 35 percent and EDF 20 percent.  Snam plans to boost integration of the Italian network with
other European operations, the San Donato Milanese-based company
said. It’s studying acquisitions or ventures with operators in
Europe, Malacarne said, without identifying the companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
