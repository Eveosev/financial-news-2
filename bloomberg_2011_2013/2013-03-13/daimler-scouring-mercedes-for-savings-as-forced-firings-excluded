Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s third-
largest maker of luxury vehicles, will avoid forced job cuts as
it cut costs at Mercedes-Benz to push its goal of overtaking
Bayerische Motoren Werke AG in sales and profit.  “We’re looking everywhere to increase efficiency at
Mercedes-Benz Cars,” spokesman Florian Martens said today by
phone. The savings won’t involve firings, which are excluded
until the end of 2016 under an agreement with unions, he said.  Daimler is under pressure to boost sales and profit at
Mercedes as the maker of the S-Class luxury sedan falls behind
BMW and Volkswagen AG’s Audi. The Stuttgart, Germany-based
manufacturer last year postponed a Mercedes profit target to
2014 at the earliest, four years later than originally planned.  To revive profits, Chief Executive Officer Dieter Zetsche
initiated a savings program dubbed Fit for Leadership to trim 2
billion euros ($2.6 billion) from spending by the end of 2014.  “A reduction in workforce would be possible only on the
basis of voluntary agreements,” Martens said. “No decisions on
personnel measure have been taken.”  Daimler was responding to a report by Manager Magazin today
that said Mercedes plans to eliminate more than 1,000 non-
production jobs in sales, human resources and finance
departments.  Zetsche’s contract last month was extended by three years,
shorter than a planned five-year extension after investment
funds voiced concerns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
