Diesel fuel in the U.S. Gulf Coast
gained for the first time in three days as distillate
inventories in the region slumped to a  10-week low .  Gulf Coast  stockpiles  of heating oil and diesel declined by
1.33 million barrels to 35.7 million in the week ended March 8,
the lowest level since Dec. 28, Energy Information
Administration data showed today.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel on the Gulf strengthened 0.25 cent
to  7.75 cents  a gallon above heating oil futures on the New York
Mercantile Exchange at 1:55 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Reformulated gasoline , or RBOB, strengthened 4.5 cents to
16 cents below Nymex gasoline futures, the narrowest discount
since Feb. 28, the last day of trading for the March futures
contract.  Conventional gasoline  rose 3.5 cents to 19 cents below
futures as motor fuel supplies dropped to 72.9 million from 73.4
million the week earlier, EIA data showed.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, a measure of
refining profitability for gasoline and diesel fuel based on
West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , dropped 39 cents
to $31.30 a barrel, the third consecutive decline, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The same spread for Light Louisiana
Sweet oil retreated 4 cents to $11.45 a barrel.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s Port Arthur, Texas, refinery, which
currently has a 57,000-barrel-a-day hydrocracker shut, had a
different compressor trip, while Phillips 66’s Sweeny refinery
continues to restart units after power issues shut down the
plant on March 10, the companies said.  Gulf-Midwest Spread  The U.S. Gulf Coast-Midwest spread for diesel was 2.13
cents a gallon after ultra-low-sulfur diesel weakened in the
Group 3 region, which spans from Oklahoma north to the Dakotas.
The fuel  weakened 2.12 cents  to 9.88 cents above heating oil
futures, a second consecutive decline.  Stockpiles of distillates in the Midwest, known as PADD 2,
increased 1.04 million barrels to 32 million last week, the EIA
reported today. That’s the highest since April 6.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in the Midwest, based on WTI, slid
$1.15 to $30.68 a barrel, the lowest level since Feb. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
