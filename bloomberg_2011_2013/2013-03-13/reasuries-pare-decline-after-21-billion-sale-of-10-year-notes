Treasury 10-year note yields
declined from almost the highest level in 11 months as the
government’s $21 billion auction of the securities drew the
strongest demand since October.  The notes  yielded  2.029 percent, compared with a forecast
of 2.057 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the
Federal Reserve’s 21 primary dealers. The  bid-to-cover  ratio,
which gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, was 3.19, versus 2.68 at the February sale.
Treasury yields climbed earlier after U.S. retail sales rose
last month twice as much as forecast.  “It shows a very nice bid,” Jim Vogel, head of agency-
debt research at FTN Financial in  Memphis ,  Tennessee , said in a
telephone interview. “We fought off some really heavy selling
on the morning economic numbers and still came back and bought
the auctions.”  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year note rose less than one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.02 percent at 5 p.m.
in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It
increased earlier to 2.05 percent. The yield reached 2.08
percent on March 8, the highest level since April 5. The price
of the 2 percent security due in February 2023 slipped 1/32, or
31 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 99 26/32.  Volume Increases  Treasuries  trading volume  rose 28 percent today to $290
billion, the highest level since March 8’s $384 billion,
according to ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S.
government debt. The average daily volume for the past year is
$248 billion.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 47.7 percent of the notes sold today,
the most since the December 2011 auction. That compared with 28
percent at the Feb. 13 offering and an average of 36 percent at
the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders , non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 30 percent, versus
an average of 21.8 percent at the past 10.  Primary dealers  purchased 22.3 percent of the notes today,
compared with an average 42.3 percent at the past 10 auctions of
the maturity.  It was “a very strong auction,” said  Michael Cloherty ,
head of U.S. interest-rate strategy in New York at Royal Bank of
Canada’s RBC Capital Markets, which as a primary dealer is
required to bid at U.S. debt auctions. “Despite the strong
retail sales data and the strong payroll data, we’ve been
holding this range, we’ve been seeing some demand on yields
above 2 percent on 10s.”  Today’s sale was a reopening of the February offering, with
the notes due in February 2023.  Repo Rate  Benchmark 10-year notes today were the highest in demand,
or on “special,” in the repurchase-agreement, or repo, market,
where firms borrow and lend securities. The securities’ repo
rate closed at negative 2.95 percent, with traders willing to
pay to borrow the securities in exchange for loaning cash.  “Before the reopenings, you tend to see the 10-year trade
pretty special in repo markets,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest-
rate strategist in New York at the primary dealer BNP Paribas
SA. “What happens is that people are buying up a lot of the 10-
year, and then those who want to short it or sell it are having
difficulty borrowing it.”  Ten-year U.S. debt has lost 1.9 percent this year,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, almost
double the 1 percent loss in the broader Treasury market. The
notes returned 4.2 percent in 2012, compared with a 2.2 percent
gain by Treasuries overall.  The government will  sell  $13 billion of 30-year bonds
tomorrow. It auctioned $32 billion of three-year notes yesterday
at a yield of 0.411 percent.  Cheap Level  Treasury securities due in a decade and more are trading at
almost the cheapest level since 2011 relative to global peers
with similar maturities, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes
show. Yields on the Treasuries were 54 basis points higher on
March 8 than those in an index of other sovereign debt of
comparable maturity, the most since August 2011, according to
the data. The spread was 52 basis points yesterday.  The 10-year term premium, a model created by the Fed that
includes expectations for interest rates, growth and inflation,
was negative 0.58 percent after reaching 0.56 percent on March
11, the least-costly level since April 5. A negative reading
indicates investors are willing to accept yields below what’s
considered fair value. The average over the past year is
negative 0.78 percent.  Retail Sales  Sales at U.S.  retailers  in February rose 1.1 percent,
following a revised 0.2 percent gain in January, Commerce
Department figures showed in  Washington . The median forecast in
a Bloomberg survey was for a 0.5 percent advance. Sales
excluding automobiles and gasoline climbed 0.4 percent, versus a
forecast for a gain of 0.2 percent.  Yields on Treasuries dropped yesterday for the first time
in seven days after climbing last week as stronger-than-forecast
U.S. economic data spurred demand for higher-yielding assets.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 236,000 jobs in February, the
Labor Department reported March 8, versus a Bloomberg survey
forecast for 165,000.  The Fed purchased $1.46 billion today in Treasuries due
from February 2036 to February 2043. The central bank has been
buying $85 billion of bonds each month under the quantitative-
easing stimulus strategy since the start of the year to try to
hold down borrowing costs and spur economic growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
