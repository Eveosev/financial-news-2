The screening of a documentary
about  Egypt ’s Jews scheduled for today has been suspended after
security officials delayed the renewal of its authorization,
according to the producer.  The head of Egypt’s censorship office “apologized to me
and told me that a security authority requested to view the film
before renewing its screening authorization and regardless of
the previous censorship approvals,” Haitham Al Khamissi,
producer of the “Jews of Egypt,” said in a statement. He said
the screening would be postponed “until we find a solution to
this incomprehensible issue.”  Egypt’s Jewish community has dwindled since the 1948 Middle
East war and the creation of the state of  Israel . They totaled
less than 100 people in 2004 down from 75,000 in 1948, according
to the Jewish Virtual Library.  Censorship official Abdel Sattar Fathy, who is named in the
statement, said by phone the documentary makers rushed to
publicize the screening before getting authorization. He said he
was “astonished” by the producer’s statement.  Fathy said he was seeking to expedite a response from
security bodies “as I want people to see the documentary.”  The screening was slated for viewing in three movie
theaters today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
