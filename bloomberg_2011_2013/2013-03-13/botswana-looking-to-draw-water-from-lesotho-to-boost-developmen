Lesotho , Botswana and  South Africa 
have signed a memorandum of understanding to examine options for
Botswana to draw water from Lesotho to boost its economic
development, according to Lesotho’s minister of energy,
meteorology and water affairs.  Lesotho sells water from the Lesotho Highlands Water
Project to neighboring South Africa. The Lesotho minister,
Timothy Thahane, said today at a news briefing in the capital,
Maseru, that the envoys had recognized the need to collaborate
in addressing acute water scarcity issues, especially in
Botswana, and equitably the resource.  “This is particularly memorable as 2013 has been declared
the United Nations year of International Water Cooperation,”
the minister said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
