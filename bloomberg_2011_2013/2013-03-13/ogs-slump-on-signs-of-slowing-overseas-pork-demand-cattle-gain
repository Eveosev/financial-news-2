Hog futures fell for the second day
this week on signs of slowing demand for U.S. pork. Cattle
prices rose to a one-week high.  Wholesale  pork  slumped 0.5 percent to 78.42 cents a pound
yesterday, the fifth decline in six sessions, according to U.S.
Department of Agriculture data. U.S. exporters  shipped  423.12
million pounds (191,922 metric tons) of pork in January, down 16
percent from a year earlier, the latest government data show.  “The movement was pretty lethargic the last couple of
weeks,” Mark Schultz, the chief analyst for Northstar Commodity
Investment Co. in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview.
“We need some export demand to get back into some strength.”  Hog futures for June settlement slid 0.7 percent to 90.375
cents a pound at 10:15 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Through yesterday, prices are up 6.2 percent this year.  Chinese pork prices in 36 cities monitored by the Ministry
of Commerce dropped 1.5 percent in the week ended March 10,
according to a statement on the ministry’s website yesterday.
 China  is the world’s biggest consumer of the meat.  Cattle futures for April delivery increased 0.4 percent to
$1.2925 a pound in Chicago after reaching $1.2945, the highest
for the most-active contract since March 6.  Wholesale  beef  rose 0.2 percent to $1.9728 a pound
yesterday, and prices climbed 4.9 percent last week, the most
since April, USDA data show.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement added 0.5 percent
to $1.4475 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
