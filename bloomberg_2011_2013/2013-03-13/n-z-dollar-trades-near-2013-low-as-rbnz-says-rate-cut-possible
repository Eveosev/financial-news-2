The Australian dollar rose against
all of its major counterparts after a report showed bigger-than-
estimated growth in employment, reducing pressure on the central
bank to expand monetary easing steps.  The nation’s bonds fell, with the 10-year yield rising to
the highest in 10 months. The local dollar reached a one-month
high against the greenback as investors pared bets on interest
rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of  Australia . New Zealand’s dollar
traded near the weakest level this year after its central bank
said the currency’s strength may prompt it to lower borrowing
costs from a record low to cope with a drought.  “It’s a very strong employment number, and somewhat
surprising given the challenges the Australian employment market
is facing,” said Richard Grace, the Sydney-based chief foreign-
exchange strategist and head of international economics at
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia. (CBA)  “It illustrates the underlying
strength in the economy. The market that was primarily short the
Australian dollar is now unwinding.”  The Australian dollar jumped 0.7 percent to $1.0367 at 4:33
p.m. in Sydney, after earlier touching $1.0383, the highest
since Feb. 6. The Aussie gained 0.5 percent to 99.51 yen, after
earlier climbing to 99.62, a level unseen since August 2008. It
advanced as much as 0.8 percent to NZ$1.2683, the strongest
since Dec. 28.  The New Zealand dollar was little changed at 81.81 U.S.
cents from yesterday, when it touched 81.62, the lowest since
Dec. 26. The currency, known as the kiwi, fell 0.2 percent to
78.54 yen.  The yield on Australia’s  10-year bonds  reached 3.709
percent, the highest since April 26. The three-year rate rose to
3.175 percent, a level unseen since April 23, and the two-year
yield touched 3.112 percent, the highest since April 25. Yields
on all maturities were above the RBA’s key rate of 3 percent for
the first time since July 2011.  Employment Growth  The number of people  employed  in Australia rose by 71,500
in February from the previous month, when it increased by a
revised 13,100, the statistics bureau said today in Sydney. That
compared with a 10,000 increase estimated by economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The  unemployment rate  held at 5.4
percent.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see a 7 percent chance the central bank will lower its benchmark
to 2.75 percent at the next meeting on April 2. That’s down from
19 percent odds yesterday.  ‘Overvalued’ Currency  “The overvalued New Zealand dollar is undermining
profitability,” Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Graeme Wheeler said in a statement released today in Wellington after
leaving the benchmark rate at 2.5 percent. “We expect to keep
the official cash rate unchanged through the end of the year.”  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive a flowing rate, rose five basis points to 2.91 percent.  “The RBNZ has taken a swipe at the market’s pricing in of
hikes for this year,” said Mike Jones, a currency strategist at
Bank of New Zealand in Wellington. “Not only is the bank trying
to guide the market toward a later start to its hiking cycle,
but there’s a thinly veiled threat in the statement about
cutting rates if the kiwi refuses to fall.”  New Zealand’s dollar has strengthened 2.6 percent in the
past year, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes
tracking 10 developed-nation currencies. The Aussie has risen
0.4 percent over the same period.  “The New Zealand dollar represents the perfect storm of
global policy friction,” said Robert Mead, Sydney-based head of
portfolio management at Pacific Investment Management Co., which
runs the world’s biggest bond fund. “The New Zealand dollar is
too strong for exporters, yet if the RBNZ cut rates, then
housing bubble issues resurface.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
