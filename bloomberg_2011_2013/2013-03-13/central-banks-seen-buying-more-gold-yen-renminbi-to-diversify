Central banks are increasing
purchases of gold, yen and  China ’s  renminbi  to reduce their
dollar and euro holdings as a percentage of total reserves, the
World Gold Council said.  Official holdings increased to more than $12 trillion in
2012 from $2 trillion in 2000, while the share of gold and
currencies apart from the greenback tripled in absolute terms
since 2008, the London-based council said today in a report. The
group is funded by gold producers.  Central banks added 534.6 tons of gold to reserves in 2012,
the most since 1964, the council said last month. Barclays Plc
forecast government purchases of 300 tons in both 2013 and 2014.
Currency debasement and inflation concerns will spur metal
demand, Morgan Stanley said in a Feb. 25 report.  “Building gold reserves in tandem with new alternatives is
an optimal strategy as central banks remain under-allocated to
gold and many attractive alternatives are either too small or,
as is the case with the renminbi, not yet open to broader
international participation,” Ashish Bhatia, the manager for
government affairs at the council, said in the report.  Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest producer, Newmont
Mining Corp. and AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. are among council
members.  To contact the reporter on this story:
