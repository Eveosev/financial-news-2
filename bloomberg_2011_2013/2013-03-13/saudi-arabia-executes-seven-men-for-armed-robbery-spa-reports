Saudi Arabia  executed seven men
from the southern Asir province for “various crimes” after
their appeal was overruled, the official  Saudi Press Agency 
said, citing an Interior Ministry statement.  The men “had formed a gang and committed a series of
crimes of armed robbery, banditry and theft,” the ministry
said, according to the Riyadh-based news service. The verdict
was upheld by the Court of Appeal and the  Supreme Court , it
said.  Saudi Arabia, where religious police patrol shopping
centers and cinemas are prohibited, enforces a strict
interpretation of Islamic law. The kingdom usually beheads or
sentences people to flogging for murder, rape and drug-
smuggling.  The Sunni Muslim-majority country and member of the Group
of 20 nations has been criticized by international human rights
groups over the death sentences.  “Executing these men would be an act of sheer brutality,”
 Philip Luther ,  Amnesty International’s  Director for the  Middle
East  and North Africa, said a statement yesterday. London-based
Amnesty said two of the men are believed to have been juveniles
at the time of the alleged crime.  To contact the reporter on this story:
