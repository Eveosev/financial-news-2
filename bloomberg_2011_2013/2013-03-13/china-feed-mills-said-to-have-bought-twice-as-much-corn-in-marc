Chinese feed mills bought twice as
much corn this month than in February, said five company
officials in the grains industry with direct knowledge of the
transactions.  The mills bought 600,000 metric tons in nine cargoes of U.S.
corn for delivery starting in October, boosting total purchases
this year to about 900,000 tons, said the officials, who asked
not to be identified because the deals are private. They
requested that the sellers and purchasers not be identified.  Corn on the Dalian Commodity Exchange traded at 2,447  yuan 
a ton (about $10 a bushel) at 1:39 p.m. local time, while grain
on the Chicago Board of Trade was at $7.1525 a bushel. Global
demand will exceed supply by 13.7 million tons in the 2012-2013
season,  according  to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Surging
incomes over the past two decades in  China  have fueled demand
for meat and grains to feed livestock.  Suppliers of U.S. corn quoted the grain at about 2,100 yuan
($337) a ton including import taxes and port fees, for arrival
in southern China after October, the officials said.  China  bought  a record of 5.23 million tons of corn from
overseas in the marketing year ended Sept. 30, and shipments
this year are forecast to fall to 2.5 million tons, according to
the USDA.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
