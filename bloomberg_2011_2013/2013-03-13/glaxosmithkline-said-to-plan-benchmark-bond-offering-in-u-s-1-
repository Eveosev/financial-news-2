GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , the U.K.’s
largest drugmaker, issued $3 billion in its first dollar-
denominated bond sale in more than 10 months.  Glaxo’s $1.25 billion of 0.7 percent, three-year debt
yields 35 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, a
$1.25 billion portion of 2.8 percent, 10-year securities pay a
relative yield of 90 basis points and a $500 million piece of
4.2 percent, 30-year debentures have a 105 basis-point spread,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The bonds may be rated A1 by Moody’s Investors Service,
according to a person familiar with the transaction, who asked
not to be identified citing lack of authorization to speak
publicly. The company scrapped a three-year floating-rate note
portion, which it had considered selling earlier today.  The company last sold dollar debt in May, issuing $5
billion in three parts including $2 billion of 2.85 percent, 10-
year bonds yielding 100 basis points more than benchmarks,
Bloomberg data show. The bonds traded at 100.9 cents on the
dollar to yield 2.74 percent yesterday, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase
& Co. and UBS AG managed the offering for the London-based
company, Bloomberg data show. Proceeds will be used for general
corporate purposes, including debt refinancing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
