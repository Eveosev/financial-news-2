President  Barack Obama  says he’s
asking the U.S. Secret Service to find a way to let school
groups tour the White House after visits were canceled as a
result of automatic budget cuts that began March 1.  “What I’m asking them is, ‘Are there ways for us to
accommodate school groups who may have traveled here?’” Obama
said in an interview broadcast today on ABC’s “Good Morning
America.” “Can we make sure that kids potentially can still
come to tour?”  Because of the budget cuts, the Secret Service said it has
had to furlough some agents, including some who oversee
security-screening procedures for people touring the executive
mansion.  The White House is a popular stop for tourists visiting the
U.S. capital, particularly during school spring breaks. Tickets
are distributed through congressional offices, so lawmakers will
have to turn away home-district voters who are seeking the
tours.  The cancellation of tours won’t affect the annual White
House Easter Egg Roll on April 1.  The across-the-board cuts, known as sequestration, are
forcing government agencies to reduce spending. The law requires
the government to trim $85 billion for the rest of this fiscal
year, which ends Sept. 30, distributed evenly between defense
and non-defense discretionary spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
