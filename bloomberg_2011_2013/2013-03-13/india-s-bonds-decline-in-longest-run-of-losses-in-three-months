India’s bonds fell for a third day,
the longest losing streak since December, on speculation faster
inflation will limit the extent to which  interest rates  can be
cut this year.  The consumer price  index  rose 10.91 percent in February
from a year earlier, compared with 10.79 percent in January,
data showed yesterday.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri
Subbarao signaled last month inflation risks will affect how
much he can cut borrowing costs. Industrial  output  climbed in
January by more than economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast,
another report showed yesterday.  “Growth seems to have bottomed out, while inflation is
still rising,” said  Indranil Pan , Mumbai-based chief economist
at  Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. (KMB)  “This may restrict the RBI at best
to a 50 basis point cut in rates this year, compared to our
earlier forecast of 75 basis points.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds maturing in June 2022
rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.90 percent
in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The
rate is at the highest level since March 1.  The RBI, which last cut the repurchase  rate  by 25 basis
points to 7.75 percent in January, will review monetary policy
on March 19.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis
point to 7.59 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
