Almost all of the 500 employees in
the White House budget office have been told that they’ll have
to take unpaid days off because of the across-the-board budget
cuts that took effect March 1.  Furlough notices went out last week to 480 workers at the
Office of Management and Budget, saying they are required to
take 10 days off between April 21 and Sept. 7, or one day per
pay period, according to an OMB official, who asked to remain
anonymous because a public announcement hasn’t been made. The
action was reported earlier by Politico.  White House staff, including President  Barack Obama ’s
advisers, also are subject to furloughs, though the
administration hasn’t provided details.  “The White House and the components of the White House are
affected by the sequester in a way that’s similar to other
government agencies,” including pay cuts for staff members,
spokesman  Josh Earnest  said at a March 8 briefing, declining to
elaborate.  The administration is also reducing supply and equipment
purchases, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
