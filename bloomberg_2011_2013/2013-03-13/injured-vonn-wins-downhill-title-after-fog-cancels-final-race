AmericanLindsey Vonn, whose ski
season ended last month with a knee injury, won her record sixth
straight women’s  World Cup  downhill title after the
competition’s last race in Switzerland was cancelled. Norway’s
Aksel Lund Svindal took the men’s title.  Vonn finishes with 340 points, one more than Slovenia’s
 Tina Maze , with Germany’s Maria Hoefl-Riesch in third. The
American won three downhill races this season, and missed six
events earlier in the campaign because of illness. Today’s race
in Lenzerheide was called off because of fog today.  Vonn underwent surgery to repair two knee ligaments and a
fractured bone in her right leg after a Feb. 5 crash at the
World Ski Championships in Schladming, Austria. Vonn surpassed
Annemarie Moser-Proell of Austria, who won five straight
downhill titles between 1971 and 1975. The Austrian has seven
downhill titles, compared with Vonn’s six.  In the men’s downhill, Svindal had 439 points for the
season, surpassing Austria’s Klaus Kroell in second and  Italy ’s
Dominik Paris.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
