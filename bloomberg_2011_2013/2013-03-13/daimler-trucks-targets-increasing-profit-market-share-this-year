Daimler AG (DAI) ’s truck division aims to
increase vehicle sales, profit and market share this year on its
expansion in  emerging markets  and demand in Brazil.  “The year 2013 will be challenging on the whole and
business has been rather sluggish in the first few months,”
said Andreas Renschler, head of the trucks unit, at a press
conference today in Woerth, Germany. “However, in the second
half of the year the markets should gather momentum.”  Demand in Brazil is expected to increase as much as 10
percent this year, helping offset a decline of as much as 5
percent in Europe and a weakening of the North American market
by 5 percent to 10 percent, Daimler said today.  Daimler, the world’s largest maker of commercial vehicles,
is lagging behind  Volvo AB (VOLVA)  and  Scania AB (SCVB)  in profitability. The
truck unit scrapped plans last year to increase the percentage
of earnings before interest and taxes to sales to 8 percent by
2013 and posted a 2012 margin of 5.5 percent. To close the gap,
the division began a program in June to lower costs by 1.6
billion euros ($2.1 billion) by the end of next year.  “The scope for market share gains is limited,” said Marc- Rene Tonn, a Hamburg-based analyst with Warburg Research.
“Mercedes might win a little on new models, but I don’t expect
great leaps.”  Daimler Drops  Daimler  dropped  as much as 61 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
45.10 euros and was trading down 0.4 percent as of 2:11 p.m. in
Frankfurt today. The stock has gained 10 percent this year,
valuing the company at 48.6 billion euros.  Ebit last year fell 9 percent to 1.71 billion euros as
 revenue  climbed 9 percent to 31.4 billion euros, making up about
27 percent of Daimler’s sales. After selling 462,000 trucks in
2012, the manufacturer targets more than 500,000 deliveries in
2015 and 700,000 vehicle in 2020.  To adjust production to demand, the company is eliminating
1,300 factory jobs in North America and slashing 800 non-
production jobs on a voluntary basis in Germany.  The current order intake in North America is a little
better than expected, Renschler said at today’s event. Higher
orders in China, Africa, the Middle East and southeast Asia may
help balance the lower demand in Europe, he said.  Renschler will swap responsibilities with board member
Wolfgang Bernhard next month to lead the Mercedes-Benz passenger
car division’s purchasing and production operations.  Daimler has two joint ventures in Russia with  Kamaz OJSC (KMAZ) ,
the local market leader for heavy trucks. Daimler took a 10
percent stake in Kamaz in 2008 and currently owns 11 percent
directly and votes the 4 percent holding of the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development.  “We’re talking to Kamaz and aim to increase our stake
gradually,” said Renschler “We will not take the majority in
the next step, but from a strategic point of view it will make
sense someday.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
