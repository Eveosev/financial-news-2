The  Bovespa (IBOV)  index dropped as
companies owned by billionaire  Eike Batista  tumbled after his
oil unit OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA was lowered by
firms including JPMorgan Chase & Co.  MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA and  LLX Logistica SA (LLXL3) ,
Batista’s mining company and port developer, were the worst
performers on the gauge. OGX was cut to the equivalent of sell
at Banco Santander SA and Citigroup Inc. and hold at JPMorgan,
Banco Itau BBA SA and Banco Bradesco SA’s brokerage unit after
reporting on March 11 a decline in oil production.  The Bovespa fell 0.2 percent to 58,078.08 at 12:25 p.m. in
Sao Paulo. Thirty-seven stocks sank on the measure while 28
advanced. The real appreciated 0.1 percent to 1.9620 per  U.S.
dollar . OGX fell 2.3 percent to 2.55 reais, extending this
week’s slump to 18 percent.  “What happened with OGX is something that’s not affecting
just the company itself,” Rodolfo Amstalden, an analyst at
consulting firm Empiricus Research, said by phone from Sao
Paulo. “It’s a sign of difficulties Eike is facing in all his
ventures.”  MMX dropped 4.5 percent to 3.60 reais. LLX fell 3.5 percent
to 2.48 reais. OGX’s production at its three offshore wells in
the Campos Basin fell 14 percent to a combined 11,300 barrels a
day in February, the company said this week.  Embraer Rally  The Bovespa earlier gained as much as 0.4 percent as plane
builder  Embraer SA (EMBR3)  rose to a five-year high after reporting
sales that beat estimates. It rose 1.8 percent to 17.45 reais.  Oil and gas company  HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA  rose
1.4 percent to 3.72 reais as regulators extended the oil and gas
company’s license to explore blocks in the Amazon’s Solimoes
basin for four years.  The Bovespa has dropped 8.3 percent from this year’s high
on Jan. 3 amid concern accelerating inflation may curb Brazil’s
economic recovery and the government’s interventionist policies
will hurt profits in industries including utilities and energy.
The  MSCI BRIC Index (MXBRIC)  of shares in Brazil, Russia, India and China
has slid 3.9 percent over the same period.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge  trades  at 11.8 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 10.9 for the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  of 21
developing nations’ equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume for stocks in  Sao Paulo  was 6.41 billion
reais yesterday, which compares with a daily average of 7.62
billion reais this year through March 11, according to data
compiled by the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
