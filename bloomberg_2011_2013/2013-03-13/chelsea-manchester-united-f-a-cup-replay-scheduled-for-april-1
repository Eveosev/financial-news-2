The F.A. Cup quarterfinal replay
between Chelsea and  Manchester United  will be played on April 1,
England’s Football Association said in its  website .  The game at Chelsea’s Stamford Bridge stadium will kick off
at 12:30 p.m. local time on the British Easter Monday holiday.
Defending-champion Chelsea forced the match to be replayed by
coming back from a two-goal deficit to draw 2-2 at Old Trafford
three days ago.  The winner will face Manchester City in a semifinal at
Wembley Stadium on April 13 or 14. The other semifinal will
match Wigan against the winner of tonight’s replay between
 Blackburn Rovers  and Millwall.  As a result of the replay, Chelsea’s Premier League match
at Southampton has been moved up one day to March 30, the F.A.
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
