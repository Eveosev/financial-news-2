Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed to the smallest in more than a week as plant shutdowns
led to a record streak of inventory declines.  The spread between the biofuel and the motor fuel tightened
5.69 cents to 55.93 cents a gallon after the Energy Information
Administration said  stockpiles  dropped for a sixth week to 18.7
million barrels, the lowest level since Nov. 23 and the longest
string of declines since the government began keeping weekly
records in 2010. Production fell for two consecutive weeks for
the first time since Dec. 14.  “The fundamentals are changing,” said Jason Ward, an
analyst at Northstar Commodity Investments in Minneapolis.
“It’s positive to the ethanol price because you didn’t see an
increase in production and your stocks went down.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery rose 4.9 cents, or 1.9
percent, to settle at $2.583 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices have gained 18 percent this year.  Gasoline futures for April delivery slumped 0.79 cent, or
0.3 percent, to $3.1423 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Production hasn’t recovered from higher costs resulting
from the Midwestern drought that scorched corn crops,
devastating yields.  Ethanol Output  Output of 797,000 barrels a day for the week ended March 8
was down 1 percent from the previous seven days and down 17
percent from the record high of 963,000 barrels in December
2011, according to data from the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm.  Corn for March delivery added 0.25 cent to $7.4125 a bushel
in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.
The May contract slipped 4 cents to $7.1025 a bushel.  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, was minus
5 cents a gallon compared with minus 10 cents yesterday. The
amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can
be fed to livestock.  Ward said improving gasoline demand will lead to higher
ethanol prices as refiners blend more of the fuel to take
advantage of the discount.  Gasoline demand  averaged over the past four weeks was at
the highest level since Dec. 28, EIA data show, and 1.1 percent
higher than a year earlier.  Gasoline Pool  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 93 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool last week, from 94 percent the previous seven
days.  The country didn’t  import  any of the fuel for a second
week, the first time that’s happened since June, EIA data show.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  fetched $2.42 a gallon last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, the
certificates refiners submit to the Environmental Protection
Agency to show compliance with the U.S. Renewable Fuels
Standard, rose 12 percent to 86.5 cents for the conventional
corn-based ethanol grade, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Advanced RINs, which include Brazilian sugarcane-derived
ethanol and biodiesel, fell 5.4 percent to 87.5 cents. Both
varieties of the certificates reached records on March 8.  In cash market trading, ethanol in New York slid 1 cent to
$2.66 a gallon; in Chicago the additive rose 1 cent to $2.565;
in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel climbed 1 cent to $2.625; and on
the West Coast, the most expensive U.S. locale, it was unchanged
at $2.855 a gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf narrowed 1
cent to 23 cents, while Chicago’s discount to New York narrowed
to 9.5 cents from 11.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
