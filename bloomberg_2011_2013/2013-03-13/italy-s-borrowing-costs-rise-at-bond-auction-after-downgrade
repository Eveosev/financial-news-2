Italian borrowing costs rose in the
first bond auction since a credit rating downgrade last week
that highlighted the economic risks of the country’s current
political stalemate.  The Treasury in  Rome  today sold 3.32 billion euros of a
2015 note at 2.48 percent, up from the 2.3 percent paid Feb. 13
and the highest since December. The Treasury also managed to
sell longer-term debt, placing 2 billion euros of securities
maturing in 2028 at 4.9 percent compared with 4.805 percent when
the same bonds were sold via banks on Jan. 15.  Investors bid 1.28 times the amount of three-year bonds
offered, down from 1.37 times last month. The Treasury also sold
a total of 1.67 billion euros of 2017 and 2018 floating bonds to
yield respectively 2.95 and 3.03 percent. All together, Italy
sold 6.99 billion euros of debt, less than the 7.25 billion
euros maximum target.  Fitch Ratings lowered Italy one level to BBB+ on March 8,
saying that inconclusive parliamentary elections in February
threatened the government’s ability to respond to a deepening
recession and the  European debt crisis .  “The evolution of market sentiment on Italy will depend
crucially on how Italian politicians manage the political crisis
and market expectations of Italy’s credibility around fiscal
consolidation and structural reform,” economists at Barclays
including Fabio Fois wrote in a note yesterday.  Italian Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani, who led
in opinion polls throughout the two-month campaign, failed to
gain control of parliament in the Feb. 24-25 vote as former
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s bloc and comedian Beppe
Grillo’s party each won blocking minorities in the Senate.  “As of now, we would attach equal probabilities to either
a technocratic government or a new round of elections,” HSBC
Holdings Plc European Economist Matteo Cominetta said in a note
to clients yesterday. “Monti would be in charge until a new
government is formed but markets may become jittery before
that.”  Italy ’s 10-year bond yield rose 8 basis points to 4.69
percent after the sale at 1:35 p.m. in Rome. Today’s sale comes
after the Treasury yesterday sold 7.75 billion euros of one-year
bills at the highest rate since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
