The Shanghai Futures Exchange is
close to adding after-hours trading in a bid to become a more
global marketplace, an official at the bourse said today.  The time period for night trading will depend on the views
of  China ’s securities regulators, said the official from the
exchange’s communication department, who asked that he not be
identified because he isn’t authorized to speak to the media.  The SHFE faces rising competition after  Hong Kong Exchanges
and Clearing Ltd. (388)  acquired the London Metal Exchange last year,
with plans to start trading and clearing LME products during
Asian hours. The Shanghai bourse, the nation’s biggest commodity
exchange by the value of contracts traded, is also preparing for
crude oil futures.  The SHFE would explore “win-win” cooperation
opportunities with the HKEx, Chairman Yang Maijun said in an
interview on March 8. China should accelerate opening
commodities futures to overseas investors and set detailed
regulations to allow local firms to hedge on overseas markets,
Yang, a delegate of the National People’s Congress, said in
proposals to the nation’s top legislature.  The exchange is close to adding night trading from 9:30
p.m. to 2:30 a.m. local time, Yang said at a press conference in
Beijing, the Shanghai Securities News reported today.  SHFE trades copper, aluminum, zinc, lead, natural rubber,
 fuel oil , steel, gold and silver futures.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
