The dollar is likely to extend
gains as the global economy is decoupling and the U.S. is
outperforming its counterparts, said Stephen Jen, managing
partner at SLJ Macro Partners LLP.  “We only see definitive signs of recovery in the U.S. and
nowhere else,” Jen said at  Bloomberg Link ’s FX Debates in
 London . “In the world where growth is decoupling and the U.S.
is leading the world into a recovery, the dollar will perform
quite well as risk capital is attracted into the U.S. It’s very
hard to short the dollar now.”  The U.S. currency is “undervalued” and the debate about
monetary policy divergence between the  Federal Reserve  and the
rest of the world will also support the greenback, he said.  “The debate in the U.S. is very different from the debate
this time last year as the market questions if the Fed will
maintain quantitative easing,” Jen said. “In the rest of the
world, central banks are going in the opposite direction. And
the dollar, after years of debasement by the Fed, is
undervalued.”  A short position is bet an asset will decline.  To contact the reporters on this story:
