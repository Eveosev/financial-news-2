Rubber dropped for a second day to
the lowest level in more than a week as  Japan ’s currency climbed,
reducing the appeal of yen-denominated contracts, and on concern
that reserves in  China  are increasing.  The contract for delivery in August fell as much as 2.7
percent to 284.5 yen a kilogram ($2,967 a metric ton) on the
 Tokyo  Commodity Exchange, the lowest most-active price since
March 5. It traded at 285.1 yen at 10:51 a.m. in Tokyo after
losing 2.9 percent yesterday.  The yen gained against its major peers before announcements
by parties on their stance on nominees to lead the Bank of Japan,
including Haruhiko Kuroda as governor. The yen has dropped
against the dollar this year amid expectations that the new BOJ
leadership will boost cash infusions to end deflation.  “The rubber market is under pressure,” said Kazunori Kokubo, managing director at Yutaka Shoji Singapore Pte.
“Recently, the  Shanghai  rubber market looks very weak. Looks
like stocks are heavy.”  The yen gained 0.1 percent to 95.96 per dollar. A stronger
yen makes the commodity traded in Tokyo that’s used to make
tires and gloves more expensive for holders of other currencies.  Inventories in China, the largest user, jumped to 107,481
tons, the highest level in three years, based on a survey of
nine warehouses in Shanghai, Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and
Tianjin, the Shanghai Futures Exchange said March 8. Stockpiles
in Japanese warehouses rose 3.8 percent to 11,363 tons on Feb.
28, the Rubber Trade Association of Japan said March 11.  The contract for September delivery fell as much as 0.8
percent to 23,065  yuan  ($3,708) a ton in Shanghai, the cheapest
since Sept. 13, before rebounding. Thai rubber free-on-board
lost 0.8 percent to 90.30 baht ($3.05) a kilogram yesterday,
according to the Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
