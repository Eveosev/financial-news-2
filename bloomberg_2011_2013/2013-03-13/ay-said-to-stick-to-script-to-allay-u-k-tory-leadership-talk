U.K. Home Secretary Theresa May’s speech at her  Conservative Party ’s spring rally will focus on her brief of crime and immigration, a return to her brief after a fortnight of speculation about her leadership ambitions, a person familiar with the matter said.  Education Secretary Michael Gove attacked Cabinet colleagues yesterday for undermining Prime Minister  David Cameron . May gave a speech on March 9 that ranged far from the  Home Office ’s areas of competence and set out her views on the agenda for the 2015 election.  Cameron approved the March 9 speech before its delivery, the person said today, denying that May was undermining the premier. May and Cameron have a respectful and positive relationship and the home secretary has no intention of challenging Cameron for party leadership, the person said.  May will use a speech on March 16 to seek to remind her party and voters that she has been successful in reducing crime and bringing down immigration, both key Tory policy platforms, said the person, who declined to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the press.  At a morning meeting of Conservative Cabinet members yesterday, Gove attacked those in the room who were positioning themselves to succeed Cameron. He didn’t name names, according to one person present who declined to be identified.  Lawmaker Discipline  Cameron’s lieutenants moved last night to discipline Tory lawmakers, telling them and members of his Cabinet to stop undermining him and focus on the opposition.  In the past three weeks, Cameron has seen the U.K.’s top credit rating downgraded and his party, already behind in the polls for a year, pushed into third place in a special election, stoking criticism of his leadership.  When Tory lawmakers urged the leadership to focus on the party’s successes last night at the meeting, the areas they cited were a reduction in crime and falling immigration, the person said.  “Some people want to abandon the course we are on; they are offering easy answers,” Cameron said in a  party political broadcast  due to be broadcast on national television tonight, referring to the opposition  Labour Party . “There is still more to do, there are still some massive areas we have to tackle.”  “It’s so vital that you look to the horizon and not tomorrow’s headlines because there is a sort of daily battle of this story and that event,” Cameron said. “It’s all rubbish. What matters is -- are you taking the right long-term decisions for the good of the country.”  Immigration, Budget  May has asserted her authority on several occasions over the past few months. In December, she blocked a bid by the Treasury to relax immigration rules after concerns they were harming business investment in the U.K. In February, she resisted demands to cut her budget as Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  seeks savings across government, according to a person familiar with the negotiations.  She was also one of a group of Cabinet ministers, including Gove, Business Secretary Vince Cable and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles who opposed attempts to impose a minimum price on alcohol. Cameron sidestepped questions today about whether he has dropped those plans for a minimum price amid Cabinet opposition and Treasury concerns about a decline in tax receipts.  Today, though, her attempts to impose restrictions on Brazilian visitors to the U.K. amid concerns about illegal immigration were shelved by Cameron, who has put  Brazil  high on his list of key trading partners.
