Slovakia will join neighboring
 Poland  in a bid to host the 2022 Winter  Olympic Games  as the
government seeks to boost growth at a time when austerity
measures and the euro-area crisis are hurting the economy.  Slovakia will offer to hold several sporting events,
bidding jointly with Poland’s Krakow, Education and Sports
Minister Dusan Caplovic said. The government will discuss a
detailed analysis of the project’s environmental impact and its
costs by the end of October, he said.  Premier  Robert Fico  wants to fuel economic growth with
public investment to reduce the eastern euro member’s reliance
on export demand from crisis-struck western Europe. The country
of 5.5 million people, about one-seventh of Poland’s population,
is counting on its skiing resorts including Jasna, which is
operated by  Tatry Mountain Resort (TMR)  AS, and ice hockey stadiums to
support the joint bid.  The total costs of hosting the games are estimated at about
$2 billion, of which between 20 percent and 30 percent shall be
borne by Slovakia, according to a document discussed by the
Cabinet in the capital, Bratislava, today. The bid comes at a
time when a worsening outlook for  economic growth  is reducing
room for fiscal stimulus as the country works on meeting the
European Union’s budget-deficit limit.  The two countries would submit the joint bid to the
 International Olympic Committee  in October, according to the
schedule in the government document. The IOC is expected to
create a shortlist of applicants by June next year and pick the
host city in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
