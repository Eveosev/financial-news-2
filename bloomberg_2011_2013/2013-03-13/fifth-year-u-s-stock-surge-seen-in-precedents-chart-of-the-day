Another year or more of gains may
lie ahead for U.S. stocks if history is any guide, according to
Jeffrey Kleintop, LPL Financial Corp.’s chief market strategist.  The bull market that began in March 2009 is the seventh to
last at least four years since World War II, as Kleintop wrote
two days ago in a report. Four of the previous rallies ran for
five years or more, and the fifth year produced a 22 percent
average gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, the S&P 500’s ascent has
been relatively steep. In the bull market’s first four years,
the index rose 129 percent, the second-best performance of the
postwar period. The chart depicts the biggest four-year gain, a
138 percent surge that started in August 1982, as well as the
smallest, a 58 percent gain beginning in October 1990.  “The current bull market is not likely to be over,”
Kleintop wrote. Even so, the Boston-based strategist added that
the S&P 500 may be overdue for a drop of 5 percent or more. The
index hasn’t fallen that far since a two-month slide ending Nov.
15, and the almost four-month interval is the third-longest
since the advance began.  “Pullbacks do not have to be viewed as wicked,” the
report said. “Instead, we should cheer them, since they help to
sustain the bull market and provide opportunities for investors
to put money to work at a discount.”  The S&P 500 has yet to retreat for more than two days in a
row this year. Yesterday’s decline of 0.2 percent followed seven
consecutive days of gains, which left the index 0.6 percent from
a record set on Oct. 9, 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
