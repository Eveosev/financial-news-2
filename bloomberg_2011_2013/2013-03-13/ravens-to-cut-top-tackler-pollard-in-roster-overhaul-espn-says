Baltimore Ravens General Manager
Ozzie Newsome said he won’t repeat the mistake he made after the
2001  Super Bowl , when he tried to keep the team intact for a
second run at a championship instead of upgrading key positions.  The Ravens will release strong safety Bernard Pollard, the
leading tackler, according to  ESPN.com .  Baltimore has lost seven players from the team that beat
the  San Francisco 49ers , 34-31, to capture the Super Bowl at the
Superdome in  New Orleans  in February: receiver Anquan Boldin,
who was traded to the 49ers; guard Bobbie Williams, who was
released; Dannell Ellerbe and Paul Kruger, who became free
agents; and linebacker  Ray Lewis  and center Matt Birk, who
retired.  Meanwhile, the Ravens took steps to lock down their best
player, signing Super Bowl Most Valuable Player and quarterback
 Joe Flacco  to an NFL-record six-year, $120.6 million agreement
that included a $29 million signing bonus and $52 million in
guaranteed money.  Pollard carried a $3.25 million cap figure for next season
and was due a $500,000 roster bonus in three days, the  Baltimore
Sun  reported.  Pro Bowl safety Ed Reed is also a free agent, meaning the
team risks losing both its starting safeties from last year’s
championship lineup.  The Sun reported yesterday that the Ravens were $13.3
million under the $123 million cap for NFL payrolls, giving
Newsome room to sign additional free agents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
