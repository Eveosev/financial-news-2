Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez ,
who died March 5 from cancer, may not be preserved for permanent
display after embalmment preparations started late, acting
President  Nicolas Maduro  said on state television.  “The preparations had to begin and the decision had to be
taken much earlier,” Maduro said today in Caracas, citing
Russian and German scientists currently in Venezuela.
“Scientific news and opinions tell us it will be very difficult
for this to happen.”  Heads of state visiting for Chavez’s funeral first
suggested embalming the leader’s body, Maduro said. Like Ho Chi
Minh, Lenin and  Mao Zedong , Chavez’s body would be embalmed for
display at the Museum of the Revolution in a special glass urn
as a permanent tribute to the socialist revolutionary, Maduro
said March 7. The remains of  Vladimir Lenin , founder of the
Soviet Union, lie embalmed in Lenin’s Mausoleum in Moscow.  The country’s National Assembly yesterday postponed voting
to call a referendum on whether to bury Chavez alongside his
hero, South American liberator  Simon Bolivar , in the National
Pantheon. As Chavez’s chosen successor, Maduro will face in next
month’s election opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski, who lost to Chavez by 11 percentage points in October.  “What’s true is that more than his physical body, we have
to keep comandante Chavez in our eternal memory,” Maduro said.
“We should keep alive his image, voice and thought.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
