U.S. stock futures erased losses
after government data showed retail sales increased in February
by the most in five months, bolstering optimism in the world’s
largest economy.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June
were little changed at 1,546.8 at 8:32 a.m. in  New York  after
losing as much as 0.3 percent earlier.     The 1.1 percent advance was more than forecast and followed
a revised 0.2 percent gain in January, Commerce Department
figures showed today in  Washington . The median projection in a
Bloomberg survey called for a 0.5 percent advance. Sales
excluding the volatile categories of automobiles and gasoline
climbed 0.4 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
