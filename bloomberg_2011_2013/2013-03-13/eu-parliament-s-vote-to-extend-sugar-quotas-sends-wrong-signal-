A vote by the European Parliament
to extend sugar quotas that limit production until 2020 sends
the “wrong signal,” according to the Committee of European
Sugar Users.  “This vote does not give us confidence that the European
Parliament understands its key responsibility to promote a
modern, competitive agricultural sector and food supply chain in
 Europe ,” Muriel Korter, secretary general of the Brussels-based
group, said today in an e-mailed statement. “At a time when the
European economy desperately needs clear policy decisions toward
competitiveness and more jobs and growth, maintaining the
disruptive sugar quotas until 2020 and potentially beyond is the
wrong signal.”  While the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm,
wants to end sugar quotas in 2015, the bloc’s parliament wants
to extend them until 2020.  Lawmakers today vetoed proposals to allow sugar quotas to
expire in 2015, “so as to enable beet producers to prepare for
the liberalization of the sector in 2020,” the parliament  said 
on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
