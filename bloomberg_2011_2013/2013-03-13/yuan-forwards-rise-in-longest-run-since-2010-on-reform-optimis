Yuan  forwards advanced for a
seventh day, the longest winning streak since September 2010, on
optimism China will embark on further currency reforms.  Policies related to internationalization of the yuan in the
Qianhai district of Shenzhen, a testing ground for freer
currency usage, may be detailed before the end of June, the
Shanghai Securities News reported yesterday, citing Mayor Xu Qin.
The yuan traded near a 19-year high against the dollar as
central bank Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  said today in Beijing that
the nation should be on “high alert” over inflation and
reiterated gradual reform for the yuan’s convertibility.  “We do not expect any major policy hints, but some
tightening bias is quite possible, which would be supportive for
the yuan,” Dariusz Kowalczyk, a strategist at Credit Agricole
CIB, wrote in a research report released today before Zhou made
his comments. Any indications of further currency liberalization
and capital-account opening will provide support to the yuan,
Kowalczyk said.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.09 percent
to 6.3021 per dollar in  Hong Kong , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contracts traded at a 1.4 percent  discount  to the
onshore spot rate, which gained 0.04 percent to 6.2138 in
Shanghai, China Foreign Exchange Trade System prices show.  The People’s Bank of China raised the  fixing  by 0.03
percent to 6.2726 per dollar. The currency touched 6.2124 on Jan.
14, the strongest level since the government unified official
and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  The yuan’s  exchange rate  is close to equilibrium, Shanghai
Securities News reported today, citing  Wu Xiaoling , former
deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, China’s currency was little
changed at 6.2085, data compiled by Bloomberg show. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the exchange
rate used to price options, held at 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
