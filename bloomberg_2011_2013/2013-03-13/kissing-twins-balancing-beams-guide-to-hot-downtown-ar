With more than 100 galleries on the
Lower East Side alone, downtown  Manhattan  has emerged as a
serious alternative to the Chelsea art district. New spaces are
also popping up in SoHo and Tribeca. Here are a few of the most
interesting:  1.  Foley : Christa Parravani’s beautiful photographs with
her identical twin sister, who died at 28 of a drug overdose,
depict the two women in white cloaks kissing in the snow and
standing in a green field. Prices range from $3,000 to $5,000.
Through April 14 at 97 Allen St.;  http://foleygallery.com .  2.  James Fuentes : Anthropologist-turned-sculptor Richard
Nonas works on an intimate scale. There’s warmth in his small,
Minimalist steel and wood structures. Prices range from $16,000
to $80,000. Through April 21 at 55 Delancey St.;
 http://www.jamesfuentes.com .  3.  Clocktower : The experimental-art space is on the top
floor of this Tribeca court building. The current show, “Dark
Paradise,” includes previously unseen photographs by  Patti Smith , Joan Jonas’s video and musician Antony’s fragile
collages. The works are not for sale. Through May 1 at 108
Leonard St., 13th floor;  http://artonair.org/clocktower-gallery .  4.  Dorian Grey : Desire and consumption take center stage in
“Walter Robinson: Indulgences,” an exhibition of 56 sizzling
works depicting burgers, syrup-soaked pancakes and pin-up nudes.
Prices range from $1,200 to $4,500. Through March 31 at 437 E.
9th St.;  http://www.doriangreygallery.com .  Evoking Dread  5.  Bridge : In one work, painter Gerri Davis’s deft
manipulation of perspective evokes the dread that Isaac must
have felt as Abraham prepared to sacrifice him. Prices range
from $1,800 to $33,000. Through March 25 at 98 Orchard St.;
 http://bridgegalleryny.com .  6.  Untitled : Los Angeles artist Matthew Chambers fills the
gallery with 62 8-by-4-foot canvases of crudely painted
abstractions, Pop culture imagery and torn strips of failed
canvases. Each work is $12,000. Through April 21 at 30 Orchard
St.;  http://nyuntitled.com .  7.  Laurel Gitlen : In Allyson Viera’s sculptures, bulk meets
elegance as steel I-beams balance atop knobby, zigzagging
drywall columns. Prices range from $8,000 to $16,000. Through
March 24 at 122 Norfolk St.;  http://www.laurelgitlen.com .  8.  The Rotary : The second floor of Fanelli’s Cafe in Soho
is making a comeback as an exhibition space. Enter through a
side door to see Joshua Mattes, a Bushwick, Brooklyn-based
artist whose kaleidoscopic black-and-white abstractions play
with space. Prices range from $500 to $5,000. Through March 31
at 94 Prince St.;  http://www.rotarynyc.com .  9.  National Exemplar : Tristano di Robilant’s abstract glass
sculptures are made in Murano,  Venice , using a complex
glassblowing technique; they’re exhibited alongside Justin
Adian’s spray-painted foam-and-canvas structures. Prices range
from $10,000 to $14,000. Through April 20 at 381 Broadway;
