Philippine three-year bonds gained,
pushing the yield to the lowest level in more than a decade, on
speculation investors are switching to fixed-income securities
on odds for a cut in  interest rates  on central  bank deposits .  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas lowered the rate on $46 billion
of special-deposit accounts to 3 percent from more than 3.5
percent on Jan. 24 to help curb capital inflows, which have made
the peso the best performing emerging-market currency in the
past 12 months. The BSP will keep its benchmark overnight
borrowing rate at a record low of 3.5 percent tomorrow,
according to all 16 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  “Speculation in the market is the BSP will cut the SDA
rate by 25 basis points to 50 basis points,” said Malou Liwag,
a senior vice president at  Philippine National Bank  in Manila.
“If that materializes, that could mean more funds moving to the
 debt market .”  The yield on the 6 percent bonds due March 2016 fell three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.61 percent,
according to midday fixing prices at Philippine Dealing &
Exchange Corp. That’s the lowest rate for a three-year benchmark
note since Bloomberg started tracking the data in October 2000.  The central bank can’t rule out another cut in the deposit
rate, Governor Amando Tetangco told reporters in Manila
yesterday. The government is watching capital flows and is
preparing for outflow risks, Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima
said yesterday.  The  $225 billion  economy expanded 6.6 percent in 2012, the
fastest pace in  Southeast Asia , and the government forecasts
growth of 6 percent to 7 percent this year.  The peso gained 0.1 percent to 40.597 per dollar at the
noon trading break in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc.
It reached 40.55 earlier, the highest level since Feb. 14, and
has appreciated 5.2 percent in the past 12 months, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose
three basis points to 3.76 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
