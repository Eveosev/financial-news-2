Germany ’s state-owned Kreditanstalt
fuer Wiederaufbau development bank will avoid European Central
Bank supervision under legal changes backed by  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s Cabinet.  Germany’s Bafin financial-market regulator will get
oversight of Frankfurt-based KfW in cooperation with the
Bundesbank, the German central bank, according to an e-mailed
Finance Ministry  statement  today.  A ban on KfW’s turning over profits to the federal
government will remain in force, according to the statement.
That’s a reversal from plans by Merkel’s coalition in November
to use at least part of the bank’s profit to reduce the  budget
deficit .  “Also in future, KfW won’t be a normal banking
institution” under German law, according to the statement.
“There is no change to the ban on distributing profits” under
the legislation, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
