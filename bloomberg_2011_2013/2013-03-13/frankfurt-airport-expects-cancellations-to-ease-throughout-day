 Fraport AG’s Frankfurt airport
continues to face cancellations and significant delays today,
though flights will normalize throughout the day.  The airport expects about 80 flights to be scrapped today,
mostly due to a backlog from yesterday’s cancellations,
spokesman Mike Schweitzer said by telephone. Strong wind and
snow yesterday stopped flights from taking off and landing ,
Schweitzer said. All runways are back in operation today, he
said.  Lufthansa listed 65 flights as canceled for today on its
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
