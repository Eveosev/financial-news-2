More than 75 percent of the
countries in the Asia-Pacific region face a serious lack of
water security, according to a study by the Asian Development
Bank and Asia-Pacific Water Forum  released  today.  Thirty-seven  developing countries  such as Afghanistan and
India are either suffering from low levels of water security or
have barely begun to improve water security, the organizations
said, urging immediate steps to improve water management.  Water security was measured by such factors as access to
clean water for households and capacity to cope with water-
related disasters.  While Australia and  New Zealand  scored better than other
countries in the region, none of the 49 countries surveyed have
reached the highest level of water security, according to the
study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
