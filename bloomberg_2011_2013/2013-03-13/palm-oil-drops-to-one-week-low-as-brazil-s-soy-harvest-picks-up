Palm declined for a second day,
falling to the lowest level in more than a week, on concern that
the advancing soybean harvest in  Brazil  will boost global
oilseed supplies, depressing demand for the tropical oil.  The contract for May delivery lost as much as 1.5 percent
to 2,375 ringgit ($765) a metric ton on the  Malaysia  Derivatives
Exchange, the lowest most-active price since March 4, and traded
at 2,390 ringgit before the midday break. Futures have lost 29
percent in the past year as supplies outpaced demand.  About 48 percent of Brazil’s soybean crop was harvested as
of March 8, compared with 46 percent a year earlier, according
to researcher Safras & Mercado. The country is set to overtake
the U.S. this year as the top exporter of the beans that can be
crushed to make soybean oil.  “Supplies will be ample in the market for both soybeans
and palm oil” from May onwards, Chandran Sinnasamy, head of
trading at LT International Futures Sdn., said by phone from
Kuala Lumpur. “High stock levels in  China ” are also a concern.  Stockpiles of imported palm oil at ports tracked by
Grain.gov.cn climbed to a record 1.28 million tons, up 70,000
tons from a week earlier, the state-owned researcher said March
8. Exports from Malaysia, the second-largest producer, fell 14
percent to 1.4 million tons in February for a fourth monthly
drop, according to the nation’s palm oil board.  About 10.5 million tons of soybeans and products made from
the oilseed are scheduled for shipment on vessels berthed,
arrived or expected at major ports in Brazil as of March 12, up
from 10.27 million tons a week earlier, SA Commodities and
Unimar Agenciamentos Maritimos said yesterday.  Soybean oil for May delivery declined 0.4 percent to 49.76
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for May
delivery was little changed at $14.6675 a bushel. Soybean oil
was about 1.42 times  costlier  than palm oil.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September dropped as much
as 2.1 percent to 6,374  yuan  ($1,025) a ton on the Dalian
Commodity Exchange, the lowest price for the most-active
contract since July 2010. Soybean oil for delivery in the same
month declined 1 percent to 8,074 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
