Roger Draper will be leaving the
Lawn Tennis Association in the U.K. after seven years, the
organization said today.  Draper is stepping down at the end of September, the LTA
said in an emailed statement.  Draper said it was “the right time for me to hand over the
baton to a new leader who can build on what has been achieved in
recent years, and take British tennis to new levels.”  David Gregson, chairman of the LTA Board, said Draper “has
made a significant contribution to the development of British
tennis.”  During his tenure, Draper has often come under criticism
from the U.K. media for not producing more top players.
Britain’s second-ranked man - after U.S. Open champion  Andy
Murray  - is 209th-ranked James Ward.  To contact the reporter on this story:
