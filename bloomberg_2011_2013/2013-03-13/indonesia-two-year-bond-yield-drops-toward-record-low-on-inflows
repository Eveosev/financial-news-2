Indonesia ’s bonds gained, pushing
the two-year yield to within three basis points of a record low,
after global funds pumped money into the nation’s debt.  Overseas investors added 2.17 trillion rupiah ($224 million)
to their local-currency sovereign  holdings  this month through
March 8, finance ministry data show. Some 33 percent of the
notes are owned by foreign funds, near the highest proportion in
a year. The nation’s 10-year bonds yield 5.36 percent, compared
with 3.72 percent for Philippine notes and 3.65 percent for Thai
securities.  “Great demand from investors seeking to tap Indonesia’s
higher yields, compared with other countries in Southeast Asia,
will see bonds keep rallying,” said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, the
Jakarta-based head of treasury research at PT Bank Negara
Indonesia. “The inflows have been steady so we aren’t too
concerned over the high proportion of foreign holdings.”  The yield on Indonesia’s 11 percent bonds due October 2014
fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, from March 11
to 4.21 percent as of 9:05 a.m. in Jakarta, prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association show. That was the biggest drop
since Jan. 23 and is close to the 4.18 percent record-low for
 benchmark  two-year notes reached on Feb. 15, 2012. Local markets
were closed yesterday for a holiday.  HSBC Holdings Plc is overweight on Indonesian debt as a
rally in government securities elsewhere in the region makes it
more likely that the nation’s notes will be next, Hong Kong-
based rates strategist Pin Ru Tan said in an interview.  The finance ministry plans to sell 7 trillion rupiah of
bonds at an  auction  today, according to a statement on its
website.  Rupiah Steady  The rupiah was steady at 9,700 per dollar from March 11,
prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. The spot
rate was at a 0.1 percent premium to the one-month non-
deliverable forwards, which declined 0.1 percent to 9,713, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivative contracts was
set at 9,687 per dollar yesterday by the Association of Banks in
 Singapore , compared with 9,691 the previous day. Today’s fixing
will be published at 11:30 a.m. in the city-state.  The rupiah’s one-month implied volatility, which measures
expected exchange-rate swings used to price options, was little
changed at 5.68 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
