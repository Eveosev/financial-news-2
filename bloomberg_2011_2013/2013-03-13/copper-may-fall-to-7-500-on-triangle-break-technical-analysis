Copper may fall to the lowest level
this year after it broke through so-called triangle support,
according to technical analysis by Barclays Plc.  The attached chart shows that the metal breached on March 1
the lower limit of the triangle formed by a support line that
touches the lows of October 2011 and June and August 2012 and a
resistance line touching the highs in February 2012 and February
2013, Barclays said in a report dated March 11. A drop below
$7,650 a metric ton would indicate prices may slide to the
November low at about $7,500, according to Barclays.  “The important thing to note is that for the downside
breakout to be confirmed, I’m looking for two consecutive closes
below the trendline,” Barclays analyst Lynnden Branigan said
yesterday by e-mail. “In terms of timing, once we get a
confirmed break, I would expect a 3-4 month chop lower rather
than an quick sell-off.”  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange today fell 0.1 percent to $7,818.75 a ton. The metal is
down 1.4 percent this year after gaining 4.4 percent in 2012.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
