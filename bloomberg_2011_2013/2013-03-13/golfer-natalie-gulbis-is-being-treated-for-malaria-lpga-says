LPGA player Natalie Gulbis is being
treated for malaria and will be out for at least three weeks,
the world’s top professional women’s golf circuit said.  Gulbis, 30, was originally treated for the illness while
playing at the HSBC Women’s Champions event this month in
 Singapore . She received medical clearance to fly home to  Arizona 
and continues to receive treatment, according to the LPGA and
IMG, Gulbis’s management agency.  The 13-year LPGA veteran withdrew from this week’s RR
Donnelley LPGA Founders Cup event in Arizona after disclosing
her illness. Her goal is to recover in time to play in the Kraft
Nabisco Championship, the LPGA’s first major tournament of the
year, April 4-7, IMG said.  Gulbis’s lone LPGA victory came at the 2007 Evian Masters,
where she defeated Jeong Jang in a one-hole playoff.  To contact the reporter on this story:
