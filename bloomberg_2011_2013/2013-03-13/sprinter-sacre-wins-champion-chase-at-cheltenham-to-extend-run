Sprinter Sacre won the Queen Mother
Champion Chase at  England ’s Cheltenham horse racing festival to
extend his unbeaten run over fences to eight races.  Sprinter Sacre, the 1-4 favorite ridden by Barry Geraghty,
took the lead at the 11th of 13 fences in the two-mile race and
ran away to a 19-length victory. Sizing Europe, the 2011 winner
and runner-up last year, was second, with Wishful Thinking
third.  “He’s a pleasure to ride,” Geraghty said in an interview
with Britain’s Channel 4 after winning his fifth Champion Chase.
“I’ve ridden some brilliant horses over the years, but it’s the
ease and grace that he does it with sets him apart.”  Sprinter Sacre sat third in the seven-horse field behind
Mail de Brieve and Sizing Europe in the early going. Sizing
Europe moved to the front at the eighth fence and held the lead
until being caught by Sprinter Sacre.  The Cheltenham festival in western England is one of the
biggest events in U.K. jumps racing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
