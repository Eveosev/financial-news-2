Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  won a lawsuit
brought by a family of politicians from  Pakistan  over loans they
used to invest in luxury  London  properties after a U.K. judge
threw out claims they were misled by the lender.  The Khan family, including former privatization minister
Waqar Ahmed Khan, his father Gulzar Khan and companies they set
up, sued Deutsche Bank for about 60 million pounds ($90
million), saying it misvalued properties and didn’t honor
promises of additional funding to develop them.  Deutsche Bank sought to enforce repayment of loans worth
about 55 million pounds, which the Khans’ companies used to buy
apartments at  The Knightsbridge  development overlooking London’s
Hyde Park and on Bishop’s Avenue, one of the city’s most
expensive locations.  “A myriad of defenses and claims have been raised to
resist” Deutsche Bank’s action and those defenses failed, Judge
Nicholas Hamblen said in a written decision. “The case is in
reality a simple debt and possession claim enforceable” under
the terms of the contact.  Waqar Ahmed Khan said the family only owed the bank 46,000
pounds, in a statement released by public relations firm  Weber
Shandwick . “It’s a pity they didn’t tell us that beforehand --
they’re welcome to the money,” he said.  Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Kathryn Hanes said the lender was
pleased by the judgment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
