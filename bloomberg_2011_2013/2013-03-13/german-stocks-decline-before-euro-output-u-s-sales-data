German stocks  were little changed
as a report showing euro-area industrial production fell more
than economists forecast in January offset better-than-expected
U.S. retail sales data.  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  fell to its lowest price in almost four
months after saying it will sell 2.5 billion euros ($3.3
billion) of shares to repay stakes owned by  Allianz SE  and a
government fund.  Infineon Technologies AG (IFX)  dropped the most in
two weeks after Morgan Stanley downgraded the shares.  Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  led carmakers lower.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  added 0.1 percent to 7,970.91 at the close of
trading in Frankfurt. The measure has rallied 4.7 percent this
year, reaching a five-year high last week, amid optimism central
banks around the world will continue to support economic growth.
The broader HDAX Index also rose 0.1 percent today.  “Given the impressive rally of the last four months,
combined with the latest euro area economic data, the DAX index
is likely to enter a new phase, with range trading in the 7,500-
8,000 level,” Peter Garnry, an equity strategist at Saxo Bank
A/S in Copenhagen, wrote in a message.  The volume of shares changing hands on the DAX was 2 ½
times greater than the average of the last 30 days, led by
trading in Commerzbank, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Factory production in the 17-nation  euro zone  dropped 0.4
percent in January from December, when it rose a revised 0.9
percent, the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg
said today. The median forecast in a  Bloomberg News survey  of 32
economists was for a 0.1 percent decline. Production fell 1.3
percent in January from a year earlier.  U.S. Retail  Sales at U.S. retailers rose in February by the most in
five months. The 1.1 percent advance was more than forecast and
followed a revised 0.2 percent gain in January, Commerce
Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median
projection in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.5 percent gain.  Commerzbank slumped 9.7 percent to 1.26 euros, its lowest
price since Nov. 16.  Germany ’s second-largest lender is also
asking shareholders to approve a reverse share split reducing
the number of shares to 583 million from 5.83 billion, the
company said in an e-mailed statement from Frankfurt today.  Infineon Technologies dropped 2.4 percent to 6.62 euros.
Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to underweight, a rating
similar to sell, from equal weight, saying margins at  Europe ’s
second-biggest semiconductor maker could take longer to recover
to 15 percent than consensus estimates.  BMW, the largest maker of luxury cars, declined 1 percent
to 71.27 euros. A gauge of European auto stocks was among the
worst performers of the 19 industry groups in the Stocks Europe
600 Index.  Adidas AG rose 0.8 percent to 78.89 euros, its highest
price since at least 1995, after Credit Suisse AG raised its
target price for the world’s second-largest sporting-goods maker
to 86 euros a share from 61 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
