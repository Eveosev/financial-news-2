The krona’s appreciation risks
hampering the Swedish central bank’s efforts to keep inflation
around its 2 percent target, Deputy Governor Karolina Ekholm
said.  It’s “not good” if the krona slows inflation below the
Riksbank’s forecasts, Ekholm told reporters in response to
questions in  Stockholm  today.   The krona is the best performer in the Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Index that tracks 10 developed-nation
currencies, having risen 5.5 percent this year.  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) 
estimates the gains are likely to continue as central bank
Governor Stefan Ingves and Finance Minister Anders Borg reassure
investors they won’t be dragged into currency wars to boost
trade competitiveness.   Swedish consumer prices fell 0.2 percent in February from a
year earlier, the statistics office said yesterday. Underlying
inflation, which takes the impact of mortgage costs into
account, was 0.9 percent, it said.   Should the krona “move in a way so that inflation is
pushed down further, well, then that’s worrisome,” Ekholm said.
“I’m not saying that’s something that necessarily demands a
monetary policy response, but it would be more on the cards
then.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
