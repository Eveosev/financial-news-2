Elliott Management Corp. boosted
its stake in  Hess Corp. (HES)  to 4.39 percent as the activist investor
raised the “intrinsic value” it sees in the oil company to
$128 a share.  Elliott continues to press for board changes and the sale
or spinoff of certain Hess assets, according to a slide
 presentation  posted online today. The New York-based company’s
share price should be $95.70 to $128.46, based on the value of
the assets it should divest, Elliott said. It had previously
valued the shares at as much as $126.  Hess  rose  2 percent to $71.69 at the close in New York, the
highest price since July 2011. The shares have gained 22 percent
since Hess began announcing asset sales in January after Elliott
gave notice of its intention to buy shares. The fund previously
owned a 4 percent stake.  Elliott isn’t seeking to remove John Hess as chairman and
chief executive officer, John Pike, a portfolio manager for the
New York-based hedge fund, said in a phone interview today. A
decision on who should lead the company is up to its directors,
he said.  The Elliott presentation is “backward-looking,” Jon Pepper, a Hess spokesman, said today in an e-mail.  “The market recognizes that our plan is best placed to
create meaningful value for all Hess shareholders,” Pepper
said. “Analysts have overwhelmingly rejected Elliott’s flawed
and value-destructive agenda to split the company in two.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
