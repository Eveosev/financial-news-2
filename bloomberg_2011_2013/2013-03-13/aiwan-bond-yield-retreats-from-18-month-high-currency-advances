Taiwan ’s bonds rose, pushing the
10-year yield down from near an 18-month high, as some investors
judged recent declines in the securities excessive. The island’s
currency was little changed.  Benchmark 10-year yields surged 18 basis points in a five-
day slump that ended March 11, while the Dow Jones Industrial
Average of U.S. shares climbed to a record. Taiwan’s statistics
bureau raised its 2013 growth forecast for the local economy to
3.59 percent last month from 3.53 percent, and boosted its
projection for exports to 6.23 percent from 6.07 percent.  “Trade volumes have significantly shrunk from last week as
stop-loss trades died down,” said Stanford Chen, a fixed-income
manager at KGI Securities Co. in Taipei. “An improving Taiwan
and global outlook will continue to present a bearish backdrop
for bonds.”  The yield on the island’s 1.125 percent debt due March 2023
dropped six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 1.31
percent, according to prices from Gretai Securities Market. The
rate touched 1.40 percent on March 11, the highest for a
benchmark 10-year note since September 2011. The 14-day relative
strength index for the securities ended the three days through
yesterday below 30, a level that signals to some investors that
yields may decline.  Currency Steady  The Taiwan dollar was little changed at NT$29.735 against
its U.S. counterpart, based on prices from Taipei Forex Inc. It
touched NT$29.81 on March 11, the weakest level since Sept. 10.
The currency was trading 0.2 percent stronger two minutes before
the 4 p.m. close in Taipei.  The central bank has sold the local currency in the runup
to the close on most days in the past 11 months, according to
traders who asked not to be identified.  One-month  non-deliverable forwards  strengthened 0.1 percent
to NT$29.65 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the exchange
rate over a month used to price options, fell one basis point to
3.3 percent. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little
changed at 0.386 percent, according to the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
