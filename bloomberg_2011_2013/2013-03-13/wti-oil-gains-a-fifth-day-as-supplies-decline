West  Texas  Intermediate was little
changed after an Energy Information Administration report showed
that U.S. inventories climbed to a seasonal high. WTI’s discount
to Brent narrowed to the lowest level in six weeks.  WTI slipped 2 cents as the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm, said supplies rose 2.62 million barrels to 384
million last week, the most for any week in March in records
dating to 1982. The report was projected to show a 2.3 million-
barrel gain, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Crude output 
climbed 66,000 barrels a day to 7.16 million, the most since
July 1992. The International Energy Agency cut its 2013 global
demand estimate.  “The rise in U.S. oil production is boosting inventories
and should keep a lid on prices,” said  Chip Hodge , who oversees
a $9 billion natural-resource bond portfolio as senior managing
director at Manulife Asset Management in  Boston .  Crude oil for April delivery settled at $92.52 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract advanced as much
as 0.9 percent before the release of the EIA report at 10:30
a.m. in  Washington . Trading was 34 percent above the 100-day
average as of 2:34 p.m.  Brent oil for April settlement dropped $1.13, or 1 percent,
to $108.52 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe 
exchange. Futures touched $107.91, the lowest level this year.
April futures expire tomorrow. Trading was 48 percent above the
100-day average.  Narrowing Spread  The European benchmark grade settled at a $16 premium to
WTI, the sixth consecutive decline and the narrowest spread
since Jan. 22.  WTI’s discount to Brent oil widened to as much as $23.44 on
Feb. 8 on concern that limits on the Seaway pipeline trimming
flows to the Houston area would bolster a glut at Cushing,
 Oklahoma , the delivery point for the New York futures contract.  Crude stockpiles at Cushing fell 1.53 million barrels to
49.3 million last week, the EIA report showed. It was the
biggest one-week decline in supply since May 2011. Supplies at
the hub rose to a record 51.9 million in the week ended Jan. 11.  U.S. crude oil production has surged as the combination of
horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has
unlocked supplies trapped in shale formations in states
including North Dakota, Texas and Oklahoma.  U.S. Rebound  “The rebound of U.S. oil output has been a major
surprise,” Hodge said. “The U.S. oil industry seemed to be in
terminal decline a few years ago. This is going to be very good
for the U.S. from an economic standpoint.”  Gasoline stockpiles  fell by 3.57 million barrels to 224.3
million last week, the lowest level this year, according to the
EIA. Supplies of  distillate fuel  a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, rose 83,000 barrels to 120.4 million.  The Paris-based IEA curbed estimates for global fuel
consumption in 2013 by 60,000 barrels a day, predicting demand
will increase by 820,000 to 90.6 million amid “elusive”
economic growth.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting countries pumped
30.49 million barrels a day in February, up from January’s
output of 30.34 million, the IEA said in its monthly oil market
report. Iraqi output rose 5.7 percent to 3.14 million barrels a
day in February, according to the IEA.  ‘Downward Pressure’  “Rising OPEC production is putting downward pressure on
Brent,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Brent, the benchmark for more than half the world’s oil, is
more sensitive to changes in Middle Eastern and North African
production because Europe has a greater dependence on supplies
from the region.  Euro-area industrial output fell more than economists
forecast in January, adding to signs that the region’s recession
extended into the first quarter. Factory production in the 17-
nation euro zone dropped 0.4 percent from December, when it rose
a revised 0.9 percent, the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg said today.  “There’s more of a negative tone to the energy complex,”
said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a  New York- 
based hedge fund that focuses on energy. “Rising inventories
here and problems in Europe are putting downward pressure on
prices.”  India Refiners  Saudi Arabia, Iraq and  Kuwait , OPEC’s biggest producers,
are in talks to ship extra crude to  India  as the nation prepares
to halt purchases from  Iran  because of global sanctions, four
people with knowledge of the matter said.  Indian refiners, who are waiting for an order from the oil
ministry to stop buying Iranian cargoes, are discussing annual
term contracts with the countries for the year starting April 1,
the people said this week, asking not to be identified because
the information is confidential.  Iranian oil shipments advanced 13 percent to 1.28 million
barrels a day last month even as the U.S. implemented sanctions
complicating sales from the nation, the IEA said  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 630,823
contracts as of 3:24 p.m. It totaled 724,564 contracts
yesterday, the most since Feb. 11 and 34 percent above the
three-month average. Open interest was 1.72 million contracts,
down from a record 1.73 million the prior day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
