Discovery Insure, the property and
casualty insurance unit of  Discovery Holdings Ltd. (DSY) , sold almost
8,000 policies in the six months since it started,  Business Day 
said, citing chief executive officer Anton Ossip.  The Johannesburg-based company will probably sell 20,000
policies in its first year of operation through May 2012, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said.  Rivals  Santam Ltd. (SNT) , South Africa’s largest property and
casualty insurer, and Outsurance Insurance Co. Ltd., haven’t
lost market share to Discovery, Business Day said, citing the
chief executive officers of the two companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
