Funding next year’s $1.3 trillion
 U.S. budget deficit  may get a boost from  Germany  as bunds
underperform Treasuries for the first time since the European
debt crisis began in 2009.  While the U.S. needs to double bond sales to investors
after the  Federal Reserve  reduced purchases, Treasuries due in
10 years or more are 2011’s best-performing sovereign
securities, returning 26 percent as of Nov. 30, according to
Bloomberg/EFFAS indexes. German 30-year bunds yielded more than
their U.S. peers last month for the first time since May 2009 as
the government was only able to find buyers for 65 percent of a
6 billion euro ($8.1 billion) offering on Nov. 23, its worst
auction in 16 years.  Germany may be stripped of its AAA credit ratings as 15
euro-zone nations face downgrades by  Standard & Poor’s  as the
region’s debt crisis deepens, underscoring the relative safety
of and growing demand for Treasuries even as fixed-income
 measures  show U.S. debt is about the most expensive on record.
Bunds, Europe’s fixed-income benchmark, yielded a record high
relative to Swedish bonds on Nov. 25, as the euro-region’s debt
crisis begins to infect even the most stable economies.  “Supply won’t be an issue certainly for next year,” Mark MacQueen, a partner at Austin, Texas-based Sage Advisory
Services Ltd., which oversees $9.5 billion, said in a telephone
interview on Nov. 28. “Germany and the whole European picture
is worrisome. The huge safe-haven play is ongoing demand for
U.S. Treasuries and I don’t see that waning anytime soon.”  Good Timing  U.S. bond returns are poised to reach a nine-year high,
even as government debt exceeds $15 trillion for the first time.
While the S&P GSCI Total Return  Index  of commodities has risen 1
percent in 2011 and the  MSCI All Country World Index  of stocks
has handed investors a 6.7 percent loss including dividends as
of Nov. 30, Treasuries, corporate bonds, mortgage securities and
other fixed-income assets are set to gain 7.3 percent this year
on average, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data. That would be the most since 10.3 percent in 2002.  The rally couldn’t come at a better time for the  U.S.
Treasury . The administration of President Barack Obama will more
than double sales to investors to about $1 trillion from $454
billion in 2011 because the Fed’s stimulus programs have
diminished, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a Nov. 25 report.  When the Treasury auctioned $35 billion of two-year notes
on Nov. 21, it received $4.07 of bids for each dollar on offer,
the highest ratio ever for a fixed-coupon note or bond. In a $35
billion five-year debt sale the following day, yields were set
at a record low for the maturity of 0.937 percent.  Crisis Spreads  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, last week to 2.04 percent,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent note
due November 2021 dropped 20/32, or $6.25 per $1,000 face
amount, to 99 22/32.  The yield reached 2.16 percent on Dec. 2, the highest since
Oct. 31. It climbed 1 basis point to 2.04 percent at 5:10 p.m.
in  New York .  The status of bunds is being threatened by  Europe ’s debt
turmoil. Germany, France, Netherlands, Austria, Finland and
Luxembourg, the euro area’s six AAA rated countries, are among
the nations being placed on “CreditWatch negative,” by S&P
pending the result of a summit of European Union leaders on Dec.
9, S&P said.  European Yields  The crisis that started more than two years ago in  Greece 
sent  Spanish 10-year yields  to 6.78 percent on Nov. 17, the
highest since the euro was created in 1999. Italian 10-year
yields rose to a euro era record of 7.48 percent on Nov. 9.
 Italy , which has the second-largest public debt burden in the
region after Greece, had to pay almost 8 percent to sell three-
year debt on Nov. 29, the most since 1996.  Last month’s bund auction left the most unsold securities
since 1995. The sale of debt due in January 2022 received 3.889
billion euros of bids for maximum of 6 billion euros, according
to Bundesbank data.  Six central banks led by the Fed on Nov. 30 lowered the
cost of dollar funding for financial companies by a half
percentage point, boosting markets and lowering yields after
European Union leaders said they had failed to increase the
region’s bailout fund as much as planned.  “Germany was formerly considered a safe haven, but now
investors looking for safety are looking elsewhere, mostly to
the U.S.,” Mark Dowding, a senior  fund manager  at BlueBay Asset
Management, which oversees $39 billion in  London , said in a Nov.
29 interview.  German Bunds  Swedish 10-year yields fell to the  lowest ever  relative to
similar-maturity bunds on Nov. 25 as the country’s borrowing
costs sank 64 basis points below bunds. U.S. 10-year yields
dropped to 34 basis points less than bunds on Nov. 29, after
trading at 53 more in January. The  spread  shrank to three basis
points on Dec. 2 after the move by the central banks.  Ten-year Treasury yields dropped five basis points in
November, while 10-year German bunds climbed by 30 basis points,
the biggest monthly increase since May 2009. The U.S. 30-year
yield fell below the equivalent German rate on Nov. 29 for the
first time since May 2009.  Appetite for Treasuries will persist amid a shortage of the
safest fixed-income assets, Stanley Sun, a strategist at Nomura
Holdings Inc. in New York, said in a Dec. 1 interview. Nomura,
one of the 21 primary dealers of U.S. government securities that
are obligated to bid at  U.S. debt  auctions, estimates net
Treasury supply of about $1 trillion in 2012, the least since
2008 and less than the $1.27 trillion for 2011.  Fed Sales  Treasury needs more participation from investors as Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  reduces the central bank’s role in the
government bond market after purchasing $2.3 trillion of
Treasury and mortgage-related bonds between 2008 and June to
support the economy.  Instead of continuing to buy more debt, the Fed announced
on Sept. 21 it will sell $400 billion of shorter-term debt and
use the proceeds to buy longer-maturity Treasuries.  While the central bank may start a new round of stimulus
next quarter, it will likely buy about $545 billion in home-loan
debt, according to the median estimate of 16 of 21 primary
dealers surveyed by Bloomberg in the week of Nov. 21.  “While the Fed purchased 60 percent of net Treasury
issuance in 2011, we expect limited net buying of Treasuries by
the Fed next year,” Meera Chandan, a strategist at JPMorgan,
said in an interview on Dec. 1.  Higher Yields  Foreign demand for Treasuries is strengthening, with
holdings rising in September to a record $4.66 trillion,
government data show. Overseas investors owned 48.4 percent of
the $9.62 trillion of outstanding public Treasury debt, the most
since May. China increased its stake in longer-term Treasury
notes and bonds by $20.7 billion or 1.8 percent in September to
$1.14 trillion, the biggest rise since March 2010.  Japan , the
second largest international owner, boosted its stake by 2.2
percent to $956.8 billion.  “The sovereign credit concerns in Europe will result in
flight to quality bids from non-traditional Treasury buyers, but
it will not persist,” Chandan said. “We expect yields to be
lower in the first quarter because of the flight to quality, but
as Europe stabilizes, and investor positions in Treasuries get
crowded, Treasuries could decouple from Europe and yields could
go higher.”  U.S. government debt  is about as expensive as it’s ever
been, according to the Fed’s  term premium , which measures the
extra yield investors demand to compensate for the risk of
holding longer-term securities, based on expectations for
 interest rates , growth and inflation.  Yields to Rise  The gauge for the 10-year note dropped to negative 0.5
percent on Dec. 2, approaching the record negative 0.67 percent
reached Sept. 22. A figure below zero suggests investors are
accepting yields below fair value on the chart.  Yields on 10-year notes will rise to 2.4 percent at the end
of the second quarter, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 66 economists. That would still be
below the average of 3.96 percent over the past decade.  Though the Department of Labor said Dec. 2 the  unemployment
rate  fell to 8.6 percent in November as employers added 120,000
jobs, government data also showed inflation remained in check as
the  consumer price index  declined 0.1 percent in October from
the prior month.  Low borrowing costs are a bonus for the government as
lawmakers clash over how to reduce a  budget deficit  that exceeds
$1 trillion. The U.S. paid $454 billion in interest expense in
the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, or 3 percent of gross domestic
product, less than the average 3.9 percent when the U.S. was
running surpluses from 1998 through 2001, Bloomberg data show.  ‘Mild Recession’  The forecast for Europe looks worse. Germany remains
Europe’s largest economy and may grow by 2.7 percent this year,
according to the  International Monetary Fund . The Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris on Nov. 28
said the 17-member euro region is in a “mild recession,” with
gross domestic product set to rise 0.2 percent in 2012.  BlueBay’s Dowding says his firm has been switching out of
bunds into Treasuries as many investors “see Germany as part of
the problem rather than solution.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
