Cia. De Gas de Sao Paulo ,  Brazil ’s
largest gas distributor, headed to its biggest jump in three
years after saying it plans to extend voting rights to all
shareholders.  Comgas, as the company is known, surged 5.1 percent to
39.30 reais at 3:36 p.m. in  Sao Paulo , the steepest advance on a
closing basis since November 2008.  The company said today it plans to join BM&FBovespa SA’s
Novo Mercado, a segment of the Brazil’s stock exchange that
requires all shares have voting rights. Comgas intends to swap
each of its preferred shares for one common share, according to
a regulatory filing. The company will announce more details
after it finishes preparing the transaction, the statement said.  “The move is positive, as it will probably improve
liquidity,” Erick Hood, an analyst at SLW Corretora brokerage,
said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. “Some investors,
especially foreign ones, don’t like to buy shares that don’t
offer  voting rights .”  Comgas had said in a regulatory filing on Oct. 19 it was
studying the possibility of joining Novo Mercado.  To contact the reporter on this story:
