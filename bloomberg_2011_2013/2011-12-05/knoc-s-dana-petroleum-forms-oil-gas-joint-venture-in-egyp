Dana Petroleum , which is owned by
 Korea National Oil Corp. , South Korea’s state energy explorer,
formed a joint venture with Egyptian General Petroleum Corp. to
develop oil and gas in an area of the Gulf of Suez, Egypt’s Oil
Ministry said.  Total production in the area has reached 250,000 barrels of
crude and there are estimated reserves of 10 million to 12
million barrels of oil equivalent; the venture, called Petro
Kareem, plans to drill four wells, the ministry said in a faxed
