The Naftan refinery in Belarus is
planning to boost capacity by 12 percent next year with a new
crude distillation unit, the plant’s head said.  The AT-6 facility will increase capacity to 12 million
metric tons a year, or 240,000 barrels a day, from 10.7 million
tons, Vladimir Tretyakov said Dec. 2 at the World Refining
Association conference in Geneva.  “This unit is important because we won’t be getting any
more straight-run  fuel oil  from Mozyr,” Belarus’s other
refinery, he said. Naftan also plans to install a delayed coker
in an investment of at least $800 million, Tretyakov said. The
unit will start output in 2015 or later and will have a capacity
to process about 1 million tons of fuel oil a year, he said.  “The volume needs to be confirmed and depends on how much
fuel oil we produce,” Tretyakov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
