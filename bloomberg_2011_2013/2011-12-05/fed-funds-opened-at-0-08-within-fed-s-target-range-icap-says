Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.08 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target range of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.6 percent on Dec. 2 after trading
from 0.06 percent to 0.12 percent and averaging 0.08 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The Fed will hold two separate purchases of U.S. debt today
as part of its plan to replace $400 billion of short-term debt
in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries to reduce borrowing
costs further and counter rising risks of a recession.  Beginning at 10:15 a.m. New York time, the central bank
will acquire Treasuries due from August 2022 to February 2031.
The Fed plans to purchase $1.5 billion to $2 billion of the
securities today, according to the New York Fed’s website. This
operation will close at 11 a.m.  Starting at 1:15 p.m. and ending at 2 p.m., the Fed will
purchase Treasuries maturing from December 2017 to November
2019. The central bank will purchase from $4.25 billion to $5
billion of Treasuries in this maturity range.  To contact the reporter on this story:
