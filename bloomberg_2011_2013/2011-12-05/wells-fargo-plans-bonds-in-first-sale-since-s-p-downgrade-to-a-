Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  sold $1.5 billion
of five-year notes at a lower borrowing cost from March 2010
even after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the biggest U.S. home lender’s
credit ranking to A+ from AA-.  The bank issued 2.625 percent senior unsecured notes to
yield 175 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. San Francisco-based
Wells Fargo last issued five-year notes in March 2010 with a
$1.25 billion sale of 3.625 percent notes at a 123 basis-point
spread, the data show.  S&P downgraded Wells Fargo, Bank of America Corp.,  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  last week after the ratings
firm revised criteria for dozens of the world’s biggest lenders.
Wells Fargo retreated to a single A credit ranking from S&P for
the first time since 2003, Bloomberg data show. Investor
optimism that  Europe ’s leaders can contain the region’s debt
crisis outweighed the cuts, pushing relative yields on bank
bonds down from the highest in more than two years.  The spread was 20 basis points wider than outstanding Wells
Fargo notes and “significantly tighter” than  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM) ’s outstanding five-year notes, Morningstar Inc. analyst
James Leonard wrote in a note today. “Given the new issue
concession provided, and the overall spread level of this A+
name, we think these notes make sense for portfolio managers who
are filled-up on the JP Morgan credit,” he wrote.  Bank Spreads  Spreads on bank debt narrowed to 386 basis points, or 3.86
percentage points, on Dec. 2 from 403 basis points on Nov. 29,
which was the widest level since July 2009, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data.  Credit-default swaps on Wells Fargo, which investors use to
hedge against losses on the company’s debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, declined 9 basis points to 140.1 basis points
as of 11:37 a.m. in  New York , according to data provider CMA.
The contracts, which typically fall as investor confidence
improves, are down from a 30-month high of 185 basis points on
Nov. 25.  Of the six biggest banks, Wells Fargo’s swaps are higher
only than those tied to JPMorgan at 139.5 basis points, the data
show. The average of contracts on Wells Fargo, Bank of America,
JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  has fallen
97.7 basis points since Nov. 25 to 262.4, according to CMA,
which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  Citigroup, the third-biggest U.S. lender, sold $500 million
of 3.625 percent notes due in December 2014 on Dec. 2 to yield
323.9 basis points above similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
