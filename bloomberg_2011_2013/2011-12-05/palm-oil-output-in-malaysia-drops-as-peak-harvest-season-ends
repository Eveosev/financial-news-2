Palm oil  output in Malaysia, the
world’s second-biggest producer after Indonesia, probably
declined from a two-year high last month after the peak-harvest
season ended, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Output  fell 11 percent to 1.7 million metric tons in
November from 1.91 million tons in October, according to the
median estimate in the survey of four analysts and two
plantation companies last week. Production was 1.46 million tons
a year earlier, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, which
is scheduled to publish the official estimates on Dec. 13.  Lower output may cut stockpiles and help prices to gain for
a third month in December. Futures may rally to a four-year high
of 4,000 ringgit ($1,277) a ton in the next seven months as
output growth decelerates in  Indonesia  and Malaysia,  Dorab Mistry , director of Godrej International Ltd. said on Dec. 2.  “The decline in production is owing to the off-season
slowdown and certain disturbances due to heavy rains,” Murali Krishna P.V., chief executive officer of TransGraph Consulting
Pvt., wrote in an e-mail. The reduction in palm oil supply will
be offset by improving soybean and rapeseed crops, barring
damage from bad weather, he said.  Palm oil output typically peaks between July and October,
before tapering off. Heavy rains during the year-end monsoon can
disrupt harvesting, further slowing production. Soybeans and
rapeseed can be crushed to produce rival edible oils.  Stockpiles Drop  Palm oil  inventories  in  Malaysia  probably fell 1 percent to
2.08 million tons, staying above the 2 million-mark for a third
month, according to the survey.  Exports  may drop 12.5 percent to
1.61 million tons, the survey showed.  Shipments  fell 8.8 percent
to 1.53 million tons in November compared with 1.68 million tons
in October, surveyor  Intertek  said Nov. 30.  Palm oil for February delivery declined 0.9 percent to
3,094 ringgit per ton at the midday break on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange. The most-active contract, which gained 2.7
percent last month and 1.1 percent in October, reached a five-
month high of 3,270 ringgit on Nov. 18.  “Because of the high price people were not willing to buy
substantially,” said Ivy Ng, an analyst at CIMB Group Holdings
Bhd. “Exports are probably slowing but could pick up next month
because Chinese New Year is just around the corner.” The Lunar
New Year will fall at the end of January.  Futures may advance to 3,300 ringgit by January and 4,000
ringgit by June, Mistry said, keeping a forecast made in July.
Malaysian production may be “flat” in 2012, between 18.6
million and 19 million tons, while output in Indonesia may reach
26.5 million tons on new acreage, he said.  Malaysian output probably gained 11 percent to 17.5 million
tons in the 11 months through November from a year earlier,
according to the survey. Production may climb 2.2 percent to
18.7 million tons next year from an estimated 18.3 million tons
this year on rising yields and replanting of aging trees, the
nation’s finance ministry said on Oct. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
