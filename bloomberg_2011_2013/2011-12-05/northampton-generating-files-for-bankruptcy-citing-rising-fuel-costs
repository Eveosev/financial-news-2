Northampton Generating Co., owner of
a 112 megawatt electric generation facility in Northampton,
 Pennsylvania , filed for bankruptcy protection, citing increases
in fuel costs.  The company listed both assets and debt in the range of
$100 million and $500 million each in Chapter 11 documents filed
today in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Charlotte, North Carolina.  The company’s “financial performance in recent years has
been worse than expected as a result of rising fuel costs,”
Warren MacGillivray, president of Northampton, said in court
papers. “Fuel costs are up over 40 percent since 2005 primarily
to increases in the cost to transport fuel needed to operate the
facility,” MacGillivray said.  The company hasn’t been able to make payments on junior
bonds since Sept. 2009 or about $22 million in certain
management expenses in the past few years, according to court
papers.  The case is: In re Northampton Generating Co., 11-33095,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Western District of  North Carolina 
(Charlotte).  To contact the reporter on this story:
