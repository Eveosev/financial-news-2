Oman’s energy minister Mohammed al-
Rumhy said the Middle East needs to create an open and
transparent energy market.  “The problem is we have not created a market for
ourselves,” said the minister at a conference in Doha, Qatar,
today.  When asked if other Middle Eastern countries should adopt
the Oman crude oil futures as a benchmark, he said: "It would be
nice. It would be a good start to establishing a market in the
region."  Oman’s oil futures, the only exchange-traded crude oil in
the region, are currently used as a benchmark for Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
