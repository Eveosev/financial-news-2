European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said it was important that  Germany 
feels included in ECB decisions.  “I see a tendency that the biggest economy in  Europe ,
Germany, may increasingly get a problem in trusting the ECB,”
Nowotny told students in Vienna today. “I think it is
particularly important that the ECB policy aims at integrating
Germany -- while maintaining the equal treatment of all
countries.”  “It makes sense to make policy that doesn’t isolate the
biggest economy,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
