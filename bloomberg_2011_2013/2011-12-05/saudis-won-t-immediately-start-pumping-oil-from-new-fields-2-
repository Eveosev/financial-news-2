Saudi Arabia  won’t start producing
oil right away from new fields and will adjust its crude output
according to the market’s needs, said Ibrahim al-Muhanna, an
adviser to the nation’s oil minister.  “Although we continue to explore the kingdom’s oil and gas
potential and resources, this does not mean that we will
immediately start production from the newly discovered fields,”
Muhanna, speaking on behalf of Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi, said
in a speech in  Riyadh . Naimi is scheduled to attend the meeting
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna
on Dec. 14 and United Nations-led talks on climate change in
Durban,  South Africa  that began last week.  Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest crude exporter, produced
9.55 million barrels a day of crude in November, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The kingdom has discovered natural
gas in the  Red Sea , in the country’s north and in the desert of
the Empty Quarter in its south, Muhanna said.  The country aims to ensure stability in the global oil
market through investments in exploration, production, refining
and marketing, and will “maintain an appropriate level of
excess production capacity to meet supply shortages or any
unexpected demand increase,” Muhanna said. It will cooperate
with oil consumers especially at times of crisis, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
