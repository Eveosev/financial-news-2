Patrick Thomas ,  Hermes International (RMS) 
SCA’s chief executive officer, said the LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton SA “affair is over,” after shareholders united against
LVMH’s purchase of a stake,  Le Temps  reported.  Hermes can expect 10 percent sales growth next year, on a
“cautious” estimate, as long as the world economy doesn’t
enter a serious recession, the newspaper cited Thomas as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
