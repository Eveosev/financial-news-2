Even with the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index down 19 percent since the bursting of the technology
bubble in 2000, it’s been no lost decade for stocks.  The benchmark gauge for American common equity climbed 66
percent from March 24, 2000, through Dec. 2, after stripping out
adjustments for market value, which gives equal credit to  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) , whose shares are worth $382.5 billion, and  Monster
Worldwide Inc. (MWW) , at $945.6 million. That’s little help for most
investors, whose returns reflect the capitalization-weighted
index, says Cliff Asness at AQR Capital Management LLC.  Gains in the  S&P 500 Equal Weighted Index  through the dot-
com tumble, the Sept. 11 attacks, the real-estate collapse and
the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression show the
resilience of U.S. companies that are forecast to report record
earnings this year even as Europe’s debt crisis threatens growth
again. Declines in the  S&P 500 ’s biggest members have left them
 cheaper (OEX)  compared with the full index than 89 percent of the time
since 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Corporate America repaired itself,” Chris Hyzy, the New
York-based chief investment officer at U.S. Trust Co., which
oversees about $360 billion, said in a phone interview on Dec.
1. “On an equal-weighted basis, it hasn’t been a lost decade.”  Emergency Dollars  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  rose 7.4 percent last week to 1,244.28 after
six central banks led by the  Federal Reserve  made it easier for
lenders to obtain dollars in emergencies and the  U.S. economy 
added 120,000 jobs. Bigger companies rallied more, pushing the
S&P 100 Index up 7.6 percent. Both measures posted their largest
gains since March 2009, the data show.  The S&P 500 climbed 1 percent to 1,257.08 at 4 p.m. in  New
York  today, as optimism that Europe would tame its debt crisis
helped the market weather a late-day selloff on reports that
euro-area nations would be downgraded. The index is little
changed this year.  Owners of stocks in the S&P 100 suffered the most since
March 24, 2000. The index fell 33 percent, driven by declines of
70 percent or more in Cisco Systems Inc. and General Electric
Co., the second- and third-largest companies behind  Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT)  at the peak of the technology bubble.  Equities suffered two bear markets lasting longer than a
year in the previous decade. The first began after the S&P 500’s
price-earnings ratio reached 31.2 following the 1990s rally led
by computer and software makers. The second started in 2007 as
global bank losses from subprime mortgages spiraled toward $2
trillion. The gauge doubled in five years starting in October
2002 as energy companies rallied 242 percent as a group and raw-
material producers jumped 162 percent.  Lehman Bankruptcy  U.S. gross domestic product has increased every year since
2000 except for the 2008-2009 period, when the bankruptcy of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. triggered the worst recession in
seven decades. Growth is forecast to reach 2.2 percent in 2012
from 1.8 percent this year, according to the median estimate of
63 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Energy producers climbed 149 percent in the past decade as
Houston-based  Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN)  surged 44-fold to $37.69.
Materials producers, including  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF) ,
gained 57 percent. The Cleveland-based miner went from a split-
adjusted $3.18 to $68.34.  “All you have to do is to look at the balance sheet and
earnings growth, and that will show you that in general,
corporate America has done very well in the past 10 years,”
David Spika, who helps oversee $12 billion as an investment
strategist at Westwood Holdings Group Inc. in Dallas, said in a
phone interview on Dec. 1. “You are seeing a much healthier
corporate America today than you saw 10 or 12 years ago.”  Record Earnings  Companies in the S&P 500 are poised to report record
earnings of $99.05 a share for 2011 and profits may rise 10
percent next year and 12 percent in 2013, based on analyst
forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  The decline in the S&P 100, whose companies have an average
market capitalization of $73.9 billion, has reduced valuations
to 35 percent below the mean of 18.6 since 1997, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The index trades for 12.1 times reported
earnings, 7.6 percent lower than the S&P 500, the data show.  Smaller companies lifted the S&P 500 Equal Weighted Index
to a record on May 10, almost four years after the
capitalization-based gauge reached its all-time high of 1,565.15
in October 2007.  “That cycle is running its course,” Matt Peron, a  money
manager  at Northern Trust Corp. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview on Dec. 1. His firm manages $644 billion. “I’m not
saying it’s over, but it’s getting longer in the tooth. Mega-
caps are looking very cheap.”  Worse Than Bonds  The  Russell 2000 Index (RTY) , a gauge of small-cap shares with an
average market value of $667.8 million, peaked on April 29 and
is up 28 percent since March 24, 2000. Equity benchmarks did
worse than corporate bonds, which returned 121 percent,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate &
High Yield Master Index.  The relative performance of smaller stocks doesn’t help the
majority of investors. More than $5.58 trillion is benchmarked
to the S&P 500 and about $1.31 trillion is directly linked to
its value, according to an estimate by New York-based S&P. The
biggest 100 companies make up 63 percent of the value of the S&P
500 and almost half of the entire American market.  Individuals pulled $9.01 billion from equity mutual funds
since March 2000, with withdrawals exceeding $27 billion each
year starting in 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
from the Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade
group.  Investors Weren’t Spared  Gains in the equal-weighted index reflect appreciation in
its smaller companies and stocks with lower valuations over the
past decade, according to Asness, who helps oversee $38.8
billion as founder and president of the AQR hedge fund in
Greenwich, Connecticut. Since most investors didn’t anticipate
that, they weren’t spared the lost decade, he said.  “Sorry, I’m not sure it means more than small-cap and
cheap stocks had a good decade,” Asness wrote in an e-mail.
“If you add us all up, we add up to cap-weighted, not equal-
weighted indexes.”  Cisco (CSCO)  in  San Jose , California, trailed the S&P 500 in eight
out of the last 11 years as the market value of the world’s
biggest maker of networking equipment fell 82 percent to $99.7
billion. The stock is down 8.3 percent this year, even after
posting earnings that beat analysts’ estimates for at least the
27th straight quarter.  GE (GE)  Declines  The market value of Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE has
dropped 67 percent. The world’s largest maker of  jet engines 
failed to exceed analysts’ estimates for the first time in two
years as third-quarter earnings suffered from tighter profit
margins in the industrial business. Its shares have fallen 12
percent this year.  Microsoft, the Redmond, Washington-based software maker,
has been displaced by Irving, Texas-based oil producer Exxon as
the world’s biggest company after demand from emerging markets
bolstered energy stocks. Exxon’s profit almost doubled in the
past 11 years.  Southwestern Energy, the Houston-based natural-gas
producer, earned $604.1 million last year after losing $46.7
million in 2000. Cliffs, North America’s largest iron-ore
producer, has boosted earnings 56-fold since 2000 as a housing
boom in  China  and demand from automakers boosted steel orders.
Southwestern Energy has a market value of $13.1 billion, while
Cliffs is worth $9.77 billion.  “It was only a lost decade if you anchored on equities as
your core holding and you relied on cap-weighting,”  Rob Arnott ,
chairman and founder of  Newport Beach , California-based
investment firm Research Affiliates LLC, said in a telephone
interview on Nov. 18. About $78 billion is managed using his
firm’s investment strategies. “It was a lost decade for most
investors, but it didn’t have to be.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
