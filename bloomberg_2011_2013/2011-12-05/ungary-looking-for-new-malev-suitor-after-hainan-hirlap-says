Malev Zrt. , the unprofitable state-
owned Hungarian airline, is looking for a new suitor after
 Hainan Airlines (600221)  reportedly is no longer interested in buying the
company,  Magyar Hirlap  said, citing “unofficial information.”  Hungary is pressed for time as next year’s budget doesn’t
provide for any subsidies to Malev, the newspaper said. An
ongoing European Union probe may force the airline to pay back
as much as 100 billion forint ($442 million), something that
would mean the end of the company, Hirlap said.  Development Minister Tamas Fellegi will speak about Malev
today and may blame previous governments for the carrier’s woes,
Magyar Hirlap said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
