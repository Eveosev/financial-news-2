Egypt  plans to sell 2.5 billion
pounds ($416 million) in three-year bonds today after issuing
less than it sought last week.  The country will also auction 2.5 billion pounds in five-
year notes tomorrow, according to the Central Bank of Egypt. At
last week’s sale, the central bank sold $2 billion pounds, 500
million pounds less than it sought, after the average yield for
the 2014 bonds climbed to 15.46 percent. The rate on the five-
year notes rose to 15.77 percent from 14.45 percent.  The Arab country, where the first parliamentary vote since
the ouster of President  Hosni Mubarak  in February is taking
place, is struggling to bring down record borrowing costs. The
yields on three-, six-, nine-month and one-year bills are at the
highest levels since Bloomberg started tracking the data in
2006. The nation sold its first dollar-treasury bill last week
to diversify its funding sources.  Egypt’s 5.75 percent, 10-year dollar bond due April 2020
fell for the first time in four days, pushing the yield up four
basis points to 6.96 percent at 12:45 p.m. in Cairo. The pound
gained less than 0.1 percent to the dollar to 6.0030.  Five-year credit default swaps continued last week’s
decline, falling five basis points to 515 basis points,
according to CMA. They retreated 43 basis points last week,
according to the data provider, which is owned by CME Group Inc.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
