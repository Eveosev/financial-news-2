  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Europe’s
largest oil company, plans to expand projects with Qatar
Petroleum and PetroChina Co. after successful ventures in the
 Middle East  and Asia.  For international oil companies “it’s important to have
long-term relationships with partners,” Qatar Shell Country
Chairman Andy Brown told reporters today in Doha. “Qatar
Petroleum and Petrochina are the key partners for Shell”  Shell has invested about $20 billion in Qatar in the past
five years to produce gas and start making fuels with Qatar
Petroleum. The Anglo-Dutch company is examining plans to deploy
the gas-to-liquids technology on a “large scale” in the U.S.  “We are looking at new opportunities and we are investing
heavily to mature the technology,” Brown said. He declined to
elaborate on whether  Qatar Petroleum  will be a partner in the
possible GTL project in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
