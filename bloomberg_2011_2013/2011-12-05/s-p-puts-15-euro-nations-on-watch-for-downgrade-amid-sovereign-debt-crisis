Standard & Poor’s  said Germany and
 France  may be stripped of their AAA credit ratings as the debt
crisis prompts the ratings company to put 15 euro nations on
review for possible downgrade.   Germany, France, Netherlands, Austria, Finland and
Luxembourg, the euro area’s six AAA rated countries, are among
the nations being placed on “CreditWatch negative,” pending
the result of a summit of European Union leaders on Dec. 9, S&P
said.   The downgrade warnings come as German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President Nicolas Sarkozy push for a rewrite
of the EU’s governing rules to tighten economic cooperation in a
demonstration of unity on ending the debt crisis. With the fate
of the currency shared by the 17 euro countries at risk, Merkel
and Sarkozy presented a common platform for a Dec. 8-9 summit of
EU leaders in Brussels that aims to halt the crisis now in its
third year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
