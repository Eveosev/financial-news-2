The U.S. Navy will spend $12 million
to buy 450,000 gallons of alternative fuel for aircraft, ships
and unmanned vehicles, the biggest government purchase of
advanced biofuels, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said.  The fuel will come from  Dynamic Fuels LLC , a joint
partnership of Tyson Foods Inc. and Syntroleum Corp., and
 Solazyme Inc. , Mabus said today on a conference call. The cost
will be about $26 a gallon, he said.  “This is still R&D,” Mabus said. “As the market develops,
you will see the cost come down.”  Dynamic Fuels will process algal oil supplied by Solazyme
and used cooking oil into 100,000 gallons of  jet fuel  and
350,000 gallons of marine distillate fuel at its plant in
Geismar,  Louisiana . The facility opened in November 2010 and has
a 75 million gallon a year capacity. The Navy will receive the
fuel in May 2012, the companies said today in a joint statement
distributed by Globe Newswire. Both companies previously
supplied fuel to the military for testing.  The contract is part of the Navy’s effort meet half of its
fuel needs from alternative sources by 2020. The deal also
follows an August announcement by the Navy and the U.S. energy
and agriculture departments to invest $510 million to retrofit
or build new biofuel processing plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
