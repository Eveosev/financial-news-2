(Corrects to show Bahrain’s market was closed in story
published Dec. 5.)  United Arab Emirates shares declined,
sending Abu Dhabi’s  gauge (KWSEIDX)  down the most in more than a week,
amid speculation a four-day gain spurred by an increase in wages
for the nation’s government employees was overdone.  Emirates Telecommunications Corp., the U.A.E.’s biggest
telephone company, dropped to the lowest since 2009.  Abu Dhabi
Islamic Bank PJSC (ADIB) , the Persian Gulf nation’s second-biggest
Shariah-compliant bank, decreased the most since July 25. The
 ADX General Index (ADSMI)  fell 0.1 percent, the most since Nov. 24, to
2,470.52 at the 2 p.m. close in the emirate. The measure
advanced 2.4 percent in the four days through yesterday. Dubai’s
 DFM General Index (DFMGI)  slipped 0.4 percent.  “Markets in the U.A.E. are taking a breather after
consecutive days of good performance,” said Samer Darwiche, an
analyst at Gulfmena Investments in Dubai. “Markets should find
support at these levels after the emergence of more positive
catalysts for the U.A.E., including the draft law on foreign
ownership.”  Stocks in the U.A.E. rallied after President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan ordered pay increases for federal government
employees who are nationals of the country, state-run WAM
reported Nov. 30. The nation’s cabinet approved a draft
companies law that would lift the foreign ownership limit from
49 percent, the news agency said yesterday. Index provider MSCI
Inc. will announce on Dec. 14 whether to upgrade the U.A.E. to
emerging-market status from frontier.  The 66 companies listed on Abu Dhabi’s benchmark index
trade at about 13 times reported earnings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with about  11 times (MXEF)  for the
MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  Yamamah Cement  Etisalat decreased 0.7 percent to 9.74 dirhams, the lowest
since December 2009. Abu Dhabi Islamic tumbled 1.9 percent to
3.17 dirhams as two trades were made.  In  Saudi Arabia ,  Yamamah Saudi Cement Co. (YACCO)  surged the most
since April 2009, rising 6.8 percent to 66.5 riyals. The
country’s third-biggest cement company said the board will
propose a 50 percent capital increase through a bonus share
issue. The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  advanced 1 percent to
6,228.16, the highest since Nov. 14.  Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  gained 0.3 percent. Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30) 
advanced 0.5 percent and Kuwait’s gauge increased 0.2 percent.
The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  rose 0.7 percent. Bahrain’s market
was closed for an Islamic holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
