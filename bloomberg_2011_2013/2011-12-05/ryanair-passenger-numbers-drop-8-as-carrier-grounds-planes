Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) , Europe’s
biggest discount carrier, said passenger numbers fell by 8
percent in November as the carrier introduced the first capacity
cuts in its history.  Ryanair carried 4.68 million passengers last month compared
with 5.06 million a year earlier, it said in a statement today.
The Dublin-based airline has transported 76.7 million passengers
this year. Its  load factor , the proportion of seat filled, held
steady at 80 percent in November.  Chief Executive Officer  Michael O’Leary  said in May that
Ryanair would ground 80 of 300 planes for the winter season as
higher fuel costs made parts of its network unprofitable. The
airline’s strategy of luring passengers with discount fares has
made it the region’s largest carrier by passenger numbers.  Ryanair was unchanged at 3.68 euros as of 1:37 p.m. in
Dublin trading. The stock has fallen 2.5 percent this year,
cutting the company’s market value to 5.38 billion euros ($7.23
billion). It is the best performing stock in Bloomberg’s six-
company  index (BEUAIRL)  of European airlines, which has declined 35
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
