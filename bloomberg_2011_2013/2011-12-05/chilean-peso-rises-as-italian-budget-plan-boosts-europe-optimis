Chile ’s peso gained as stocks and the
euro rose after Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  proposed a 30
billion euro ($40.3 billion) plan to reduce the country’s debt,
boosting appetite for riskier assets such as emerging-market
currencies.  Chile’s peso strengthened 0.2 percent to 513.55 per  U.S.
dollar  from 514.45 per dollar on Dec. 2. The Bloomberg JPMorgan
Latin American Currency Index advanced 0.5 percent.  The MSCI World Index rose 1.3 percent, extending its
biggest weekly gain since March, after Italian borrowing costs
fell to a one-month low. European optimism outweighed data
released today that showed Chile’s economy  expanded  3.4 percent
in October, less than the 4.2 percent median forecast of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg and down from September’s 5.7
percent.  “That argues more for a central bank rate cut, but the
external news is having more weight,” said Andres de la Cerda,
a money markets trader at Bice Inversiones in Santiago. “The
news from  Italy  is positive.”  Inflation-linked central bank and government bond yields
fell today. The yield on inflation-linked central bank debt due
in February 2021 fell four basis points to 2.68 percent. The
yield on a similar bond due in August 2016 fell six basis points
to 2.51 percent. The yield on a 20-year government inflation-
linked bond fell 11 basis points to 2.93 percent.  The yield on the 10-year bond may fall to 2.4 percent,
economists at Larrain Vial SA wrote today in a note to clients,
reiterating an earlier forecast.  Offshore investors in the Chilean peso forwards market had
a $5.1 billion net short position in the peso versus the dollar
on Dec. 1, down from $5.9 billion a week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
