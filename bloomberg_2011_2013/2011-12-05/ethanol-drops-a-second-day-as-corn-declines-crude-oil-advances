Ethanol futures eased for a second
day in  Chicago  as corn declined and crude oil rose.  Futures slipped 0.1 percent as corn, the primary input for
the biofuel in the U.S., fell on speculation an Agriculture
Department report this week will show ample inventories of the
grain. Oil gained as much as 1.5 percent before ending 3 cents
higher amid tension in the  Middle East  that threatens supply and
on speculation that European leaders will remedy the region’s
debt crisis, boosting fuel demand.  “It really, really doesn’t” have any direction, said  Dan Flynn , a trader at PFGBest in Chicago. “There’s record corn for
ethanol. Stockpiles are good right now. We’re seeing higher
prices on crude because of unrest in the Mideast and good news
out of  Europe .”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery fell 0.3 cent to
$2.50 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. The contract
expired today. Prices have gained 5.1 percent this year. The
more active January contract dropped 1.2 cents to $2.204.  In cash market trading ethanol in  New York  sank 10.5 cents,
or 3.8 percent, to $2.69 a gallon and in Chicago the additive
lost 10.5 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $2.575, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf dropped 10 cents, or 3.6 percent,
to $2.705 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel slid 8
cents, or 2.9 percent, to $2.725.  Corn for March delivery tumbled 4.25 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $5.91 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel distills into about
2.75 gallons of the alternative fuel.  The Agriculture Department plans to release its forecast
for U.S. and world corn inventories Dec. 9.  Crude for January delivery climbed 3 cents to $100.99 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since Nov. 16. Prices are up 11 percent this year.
Ethanol is part of U.S. energy plans to reduce dependence on the
 fossil fuel .  To contact the reporter on this story:
