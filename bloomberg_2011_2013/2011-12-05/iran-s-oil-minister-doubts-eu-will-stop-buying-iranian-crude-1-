Iran’s oil minister said he doesn’t
expect  Europe  to stop buying crude from his country.  There are “some doubts the decision will be taken,”
Rostam Qasemi said in Doha, Qatar. “They are very wise.”  The European Union tightened sanctions on Iran on Dec. 1 in
a clampdown on the country’s nuclear program, potentially
igniting tensions in the  Middle East  that may threaten the flow
of oil. The EU was divided over a possible halt to purchases of
Iranian crude.  Following up on penalties imposed by the U.S. last month,
the EU added 180 Iranian officials and companies to a blacklist
and started work on sanctions on the country’s oil exports,
banks, transport sector and the Revolutionary Guard Corps.  Iran  is the second-largest oil supplier in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, earning $56 billion in the
first seven months of 2011, according to U.S. Energy Department
estimates. Iran pumped 3.6 million barrels a day last month, a
Bloomberg survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
