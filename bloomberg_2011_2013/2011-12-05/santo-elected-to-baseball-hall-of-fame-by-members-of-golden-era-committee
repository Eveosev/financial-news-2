Ron Santo, a nine-time All-Star third
baseman for the  Chicago Cubs  who battled diabetes throughout his
career, was elected to baseball’s Hall of Fame with 15 votes
from the 16 members of the Golden Era Committee.  The results were announced today at the Baseball Winter
Meetings in  Dallas . The panel covers the 1947-72 period and is
one of three groups set up to consider veterans for the Hall of
Fame in Cooperstown, New York.  “I always admired Ron’s courage and loyalty, and I miss
him very much,” Commissioner  Bud Selig  said in a statement
released by  Major League Baseball . “Today, I am so proud to
know that his contributions to baseball will receive the highest
honor.”  Santo, who died in December 2010 at the age of 70, had 342
home runs and won five Gold Gloves for his defense. He played
for the Cubs from 1960 through 1973 and finished with the
 Chicago White Sox  in 1974.  “Everybody saw the numbers, the homers, the Gold Gloves,”
Billy Williams, a former teammate of Santo and a Hall of Fame
member who sits on the committee, said in a news conference.  Santo, who became a Cubs radio broadcaster after his
playing days ended, will be inducted on July 22, 2012, along
with any recently retired players selected in January by a vote
of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America.  Nine other former players and executives failed to receive
the 12 votes needed from committee members today for induction
into the sport’s shrine.  Hodges Misses  Pitcher Jim Kaat received 10 votes; first baseman Gil Hodges and infielder/outfielder Minnie Minoso got nine each; and
right fielder Tony Oliva received eight.  Other former players who failed to receive the required 75
percent of votes cast were Allie Reynolds, Ken Boyer and Luis Tiant. Baseball executives Buzzie Bavasi, the Dodgers’ franchise
general manager from 1951 to 1967, and Charlie Finley, who owned
the Athletics’ franchise from 1960 to 1980, also were on the
ballot.  The voting continues the disappointment of family and fans
of Hodges, who helped the Dodgers to seven National League
pennants in  Brooklyn  and  Los Angeles  and managed the  New York
Mets  to their first World Series title in 1969.  Hodges is the only player no longer included in Baseball
Writers’ Association of America voting to be selected on at
least 60 percent of ballots -- he did that three times,
including 63 percent in his final year of eligibility in 1983 --
and not subsequently get enshrined.  Santo received more than 40 percent of the BBWAA vote only
once, capturing 43 percent in his final year of eligibility in
1998.  ‘Miracle Mets’  Hodges, who died in 1972 two days before his 48th birthday,
was an eight-time All-Star who started with the  Brooklyn Dodgers 
in 1947 and moved with the team to Los Angeles in 1958. He
stayed with the Dodgers through 1961 before playing his final
two seasons with the Mets, ending his career with 370 home runs,
a .274 batting average and 1,274 runs batted in. He won three
Gold Gloves for his fielding.  He managed the  Washington Senators  for five seasons, and
then in two years transformed New York from a last-place team
into the “Miracle Mets” who went 100-62 in 1969 and won the
World Series over the  Baltimore Orioles .  Hodges fell short of Hall of Fame induction during his 15
years of post-career eligibility with the writers’ group. He
also has been passed over for years by veterans committees,
falling one vote short in 1993.  ‘Great, Great Player’  “I am very much surprised that he’s not in the Hall of
Fame,” Tommy Lasorda, a member of the Golden Era committee and
a teammate of Hodges on the 1954-55 Dodgers, said in a news
conference today. “He was one of the greatest persons and he
was a great, great player.”  Lasorda didn’t say if he voted for Hodges.  Golden Era voters also include Hall of Fame members  Hank Aaron , Al Kaline, Ralph Kiner, Juan Marichal, Brooks Robinson
and Don Sutton, as well as executives such as Gene Michael of
the  New York  Yankees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
