The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Mexico  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close of trading.  The IPC  index (MEXBOL)  rose 0.9 percent to 37,103.17. Earlier, the
gauge briefly dropped as much as 0.5 percent as Industrias
Penoles SAB plunged about 9 percent in less than a minute. A
Penoles investor relations official said the company didn’t know
the reason for the drop. The stock recovered most of its losses
within about three minutes.  Mexican stocks followed U.S. equities higher as Italy’s
 Mario Monti  proposed budget cuts and Germany and  France  pushed
for a new European Union treaty to fight the debt crisis.  Separately, Mexico’s manufacturing index rose to 53.3 in
November, the Mexican Institute of Finance Executives, or IMEF,
said today. Economists forecast the gauge would be 52, according
to the median of four estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO)  , the largest cement maker in the
Americas, rose 5.4 percent to 6.81 pesos.  Desarrolladora Homex
