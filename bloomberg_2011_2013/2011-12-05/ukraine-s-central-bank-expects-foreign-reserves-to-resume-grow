Ukraine’s  central bank  said foreign-
currency and gold reserves will probably resume growth after two
months of declines as the former Soviet republic seeks to pay
for natural-gas imports in Russian rubles.  The central bank is also taking steps to reduce demand for
dollars among the country’s 46 million population, which is
estimated at about $10 billion a year, Governor Serhiy Arbuzov
said today in a statement on the bank’s  website .  “If there’s no disagreement with foreign investors or
panic among domestic investors, reserves will rise,” Arbuzov
said, without saying when the increase would begin.  The central bank controls the hryvnia’s exchange by buying
and selling dollars on the  interbank market . Reserves declined
to $34.16 billion in October from $34.95 billion the previous
month and $38.2 billion in August, according to central bank
data. They rose to an all-time high of $38.35 billion in April
from $25.29 billion at the start of 2009.  Capital inflows to Ukraine were almost $14 billion in the
year through November, Arbuzov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
