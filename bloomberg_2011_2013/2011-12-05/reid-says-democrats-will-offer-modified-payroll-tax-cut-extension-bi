U.S. Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said Democrats will introduce a “modified” version of a
payroll tax cut extension for workers for 2012 today. The
measure will be offset by a “scaled-back, temporary” surtax on
annual income exceeding $1 million.  “Raising taxes on American families by $1,000 next month
will have an immediate negative impact on the economy,” Reid
said today on the Senate floor. “We all know Congress can’t
afford to play chicken with this economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
