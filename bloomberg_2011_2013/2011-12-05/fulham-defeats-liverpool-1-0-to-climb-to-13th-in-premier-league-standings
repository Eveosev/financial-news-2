Fulham defeated Liverpool 1-0 last
night as  Clint Dempsey ’s 85th-minute goal pushed the Cottagers
up to 13th place in English soccer’s Premier League.  The American forward reacted quickly to put the home side
ahead when Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina fumbled a Danny
Murphy shot. Liverpool, which missed a chance to move to fifth
place, was reduced to 10 men in the 71st minute when Jay
Spearing was sent off for a tackle on Moussa Dembele.  Liverpool could have leapfrogged Arsenal and Newcastle with
a win, but finished the night in seventh place with 23 points.
Fulham, which was two points above the relegation zone in 16th
place before the match, moved above Wolverhampton, Swansea and
West Brom. The Cottagers have 15 points, one fewer than 9th
placed  Aston Villa .  “We have been playing well but not getting the rub of the
green,” Fulham’s Stephen Kelly told the British Broadcasting
Corp. “As soon as their player got sent off, we created more
chances and got at them.”  Dempsey and Liverpool’s  Stewart Downing  and  Jordan
Henderson  had shots hit the woodwork.  To contact the reporter on this story:
