Democrats in the U.S. Senate are
proposing to raise the fees  Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac charge to
lenders to offset the $185 billion cost of extending and
expanding a payroll tax cut for workers into 2012, according to
a summary released by Senator Robert Casey.  The legislation would also impose a 1.9 percent surtax on
income over $1 million, which is lower than a 3.25 percent
surtax Democrats had previously proposed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
