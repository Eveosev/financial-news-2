California  Governor  Jerry Brown  began
a drive to place temporary income- and sales-tax increases
before voters on the state election ballot next year, as a way
to deal with a looming budget deficit.  Brown will submit his proposal to the state Attorney
General’s office today, the governor said. If it qualifies,
voters in November 2012 would decide whether to raise levies on
individuals making $250,000 a year or more, or on couples
earning $500,000 or better. The measure also calls for a 6.9
percent boost in the state’s sales-tax rate to 7.75 percent.  “I am going directly to the voters because I don’t want to
get bogged down in partisan gridlock as happened this year,”
the governor said today in an open letter.  Brown, 73, has said he would push for the ballot measure
after failing to win legislative approval in June to extend $11
billion of higher taxes and fees, which have since expired.
State officials have said that a sluggish economic recovery is
unlikely to produce $3.7 billion in revenue Brown built into the
current budget. A shortfall of that size would trigger automatic
mid-year spending cuts.  The ballot measure would increase income levies for
individuals making $250,000 to $300,000 by 1 percentage point,
to 10.3 percent. For those earning $300,000 to $500,000, the
rate would jump to 10.8 percent, both from 9.3 percent now,
 according  to the Franchise Tax Board. For single filers with
income topping $500,000, the rate would climb to 11.3 percent.  Current Rates  California  currently taxes income of more than $1 million
at 10.3 percent, with the additional 1 percentage point
earmarked for mental-health services, under a 2004 initiative.  The Attorney General’s office must produce a summary and
title for Brown’s measure before supporters can start gathering
signatures needed to put it on the ballot.  The increases would raise an estimated $7 billion a year.
Both would expire in 2017, according to the initiative. In
crafting this year’s budget, which passed in June, lawmakers cut
more than $12 billion in proposed spending to help balance the
plan with projected revenue.  The state Legislative Analyst’s Office has said California
may face a $13 billion deficit in fiscal 2013, which begins in
July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
