Shares of the following companies had
 unusual (JCI)  moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the close in Jakarta.  The Jakarta Composite index rose less than 0.1 percent to
3,780.79.  PT Timah (TINS)  ,  Indonesia ’s largest tin producer, fell
1.7 percent to 1,730 rupiah. Tin futures declined for a third
day in  London , dropping as much as 1.4 percent to $19,725 a
metric ton.  PT Unilever Indonesia (UNVR)  , the nation’s biggest
detergent maker, rose 1.7 percent to 17,900 rupiah. The shares
gained because of year-end “window dressing,” when fund
managers buy better-performing stocks to boost the appearance of
their portfolios, according to Ikhsan Binarto, an analyst at PT
Indo Premier Securities in Jakarta. Unilever has risen 8.5
percent this year, compared with a 2.1 percent gain in the
benchmark index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
