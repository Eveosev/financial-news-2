Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista ’s
 LLX Logistica SA  surged the most in two years after a contract
for an oil and gas contract at its Acu port boosted prospects
for further industry deals.  The stock jumped 10 percent, the most since October 2009,
to 3.61 reais at the close of trading in Sao Paulo.  LLX, in a regulatory filing today, said it signed a leasing
contract with Intermoor do Brasil Servicos Offshore de
Instalacao Ltda, part of Grupo Acteon. Intermoor will build a
unit at Acu to support the oil and gas industries, and the
contract will generate annual revenue of about 3.6 million reais
($2 million), LLX said. Acu is located in Rio de Janeiro state.  “When someone closes an oil and gas contract, it opens up
a new outlook” for the company, said Rogerio Freitas, a partner
at Rio de Janeiro-based hedge fund Teorica Investimentos.
“People were saying before that the terrain would remain
restricted to steel, OSX, mining.”  OSX Brasil SA  is Batista’s shipbuilding start-up.  To contact the reporter on this story:
