India  plans to offer its first shale
gas blocks to developers by 2014 and seeks to raise natural-gas
production from offshore fields, an official said.  “Shale gas resources assessment is going on now,”
Narasimha Raju, joint secretary of India’s ministry of petroleum
and natural gas, said today in an interview in Doha, Qatar. The
country needs to devise a regulatory framework for developing
the shale blocks, which may take one or two years, he said.  Shale development, where rock formations are horizontally
drilled and broken apart using water, sand and chemicals under
high pressure to release trapped gas, has driven a surge in U.S.
gas output that made the country the world’s largest producer
and a net exporter in 2009. India may have 63 trillion cubic
feet of recoverable shale resources, enough to meet its
consumption for 33 years, the IEA said in April.  The country may also increase crude oil and gas output from
deepwater fields, where BP Plc and India’s Reliance Industries
Ltd. are doing small-scale recovery projects, Raju said.  India currently produces 40 to 42 million standard cubic
meters of natural gas and about 20,000 barrels a day of oil from
its deep sea deposits, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
