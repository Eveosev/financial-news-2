MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, plans to submit a fresh capital plan to the  Federal
Reserve  in January after the regulator rejected the companyâ€™s
proposal to raise its dividend and resume share buybacks.  The insurer expects to hear from the Fed by the end of the
first quarter, Chief Executive Officer  Steven Kandarian  said
today in a conference call held by the New York-based company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
