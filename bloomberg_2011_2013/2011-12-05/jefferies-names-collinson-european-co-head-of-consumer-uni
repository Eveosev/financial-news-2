Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) , the investment
bank that’s been expanding since the financial crisis, hired
Michael Collinson from  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  as a

investment banking.  Collinson was a managing director in the consumer
industries group of global banking and markets at RBS, New York-

in August as a managing director in its global industrials
group, based in  Frankfurt .  “Michael’s hiring brings to Jefferies a highly respected
senior consumer banker with strong M&A expertise to lead our
