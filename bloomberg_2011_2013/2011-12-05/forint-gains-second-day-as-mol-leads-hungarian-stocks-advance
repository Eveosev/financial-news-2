The forint appreciated for a second
day after posting the biggest weekly advance in more than two
years last week on speculation European leaders will take steps
to stop the spread of the region’s debt crisis.  Hungary’s currency strengthened 1.2 percent to 299.85 per
euro, the strongest on a closing level since Oct. 27. The BUX
 index (BUX)  of shares advanced 1.7 percent to 17,745.74 as Mol Nyrt.,
the country’s biggest refiner, jumped 3.3 percent by the close
in Budapest.  Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti today introduced a 30
billion-euro ($40 billion) package of austerity and growth
measures to trim the euro-region’s second-biggest debt and
prevent  Italy  from sparking the euro’s breakup. Hungary, the
European Union’s most-indebted eastern member, last month asked
for fresh assistance from the  International Monetary Fund  amid
what Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  called a ‘‘speculative attack’’
on the forint.  “Risk appetite is growing amid the improving international
sentiment, which can also be seen in the forint’s gains,” Peter Karsai, a Budapest-based trader at Commerzbank AG, and
colleagues, wrote in an e-mail today. “Monti’s so-called rescue
package seems to be convincing.”  The government’s  10-year bonds  rallied for a fourth day,
cutting the yield 13 basis points to 8.39 percent, according to
generic prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The cost of insuring against a default on  Hungary ’s bonds
with credit-default swaps fell to 548 basis points from 561
basis points on Dec. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
