Tanzania’s benchmark coffee grade
fell 5.8 percent at a sale on Dec. 1 as supplies increased and
global prices declined, the Tanzania Coffee Board said.  The highest price paid for the arabica AA grade dropped to
$321 per 50-kilogram (110 pounds) bag from $340.80 a week
earlier, the board said in an e-mailed statement today. The
average price for the grade fell 0.9 percent to $284.37 as
supplies more than doubled to 8,385 bags, it said.  Total supplies at the auction rose 30 percent to 28,611
bags while sales climbed 21 percent to 22,290 bags, the agency
said. Arabica accounts for 75 percent of Tanzania’s output with
robusta making up the rest.  The following are details of the auction in dollars per 50-
kilogram bag:  To contact the reporter on this story:
