Axa SA (CS) ,  Europe ’s second-biggest
insurer, plans to cut its full-time workforce in  Germany  by 18
percent to reduce its costs amid “difficult” price competition
in Europe’s largest economy.  The German unit,  Axa Konzern AG , will cut about 1,600 of
9,000 positions by 2015 to help save as much as 320 million
euros ($430 million) per year, Ingo Koch, a spokesman for the
company, said by phone today. He confirmed an interview with the
unit’s head, Frank Keuper, in the German newspaper  Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung .  “We need to make sure that we remain competitive with
pricing, which is very difficult in Germany at the moment,”
Koch said.  Axa, led by Chief Executive Officer Henri de Castries, is
banking on  Asia  and scaling back in some developed markets as it
aims for 10 percent annual growth in operating earnings per
share through 2015. The Paris-based insurer is targeting annual
operating profit of more than 6 billion euros by 2015, up from
3.9 billion euros last year.  Axa made similar cuts after it bought Credit Suisse Group
AG’s Winterthur insurance business in 2006. The German DBV-
Winterthur unit was combined with Cologne-based Axa Konzern,
resulting in a reduction of 1,200 positions.  The reductions will be “socially responsible” and make
the insurer “more efficient, with measures including
digitalization and automation of workflows as well as a
streamlining of processes,” Koch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
