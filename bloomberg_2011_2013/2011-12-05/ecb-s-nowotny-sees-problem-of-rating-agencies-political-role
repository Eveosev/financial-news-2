European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said that  Standard & Poor’s  move to
put 15 euro nations on review for possible downgrade shows the
problem of rating companies’ increasingly political position.
“This step highlights the problem that rating agencies
increasingly are assuming a political role,” Nowotny, who also
heads  Austria ’s central bank, said today in an interview in
Vienna. “Nevertheless, the necessity remains that Austria
pursues a policy of long-term budget consolidation.”  The rating company today put the countries on review,
saying that “systemic stress in the euro zone has risen in
recent weeks and reached such a level that a review of all euro
zone sovereign ratings is warranted.” This includes Austria,
which currently is rated AAA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
