Greece , Portugal, Italy and  Spain 
will struggle to return to sustainable public debt,  Handelsblatt 
reported, citing calculations by the Freiburg, Germany-based
Centre for European Policy.  CEP’s default indexes for Greece, Portugal and Italy, which
measure debt sustainability, fell in the first half while
Spain’s stagnated, Handelsblatt reported.  Greece, Portugal and Italy continued to import more capital
than they invested, the newspaper cited the CEP figures as
saying. Spain barely invested more capital than it imported, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
