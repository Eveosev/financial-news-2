Croatia’s new government must take
“unpopular” decisions on spending cuts after winning elections
yesterday, said Michele Napolitano, an associate director at
 Fitch Ratings  in  London .  The following are comments Napolitano made in a phone
interview today.  “We have to wait for their budget proposal. On paper, the
new government’s economic program seems to be in the right
direction, as we clearly see they want to cap the public debt at
60 percent of gross domestic product, and they also want to cut
the  budget deficit  to 3 percent from 6 percent of GDP.  ‘‘Fitch’s real GDP growth forecast for the next year is 0.3
percent, much lower than the 2.5 percent on which the current
budget is based. Therefore, with weaker revenue growth, the
government would need to cut expenditures, particularly in
pensions, ministerial budgets and public sector wages. And
these are not popular decisions to take.”  It’s “too soon” to say how the new government will impact
the country’s credit ratings, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
