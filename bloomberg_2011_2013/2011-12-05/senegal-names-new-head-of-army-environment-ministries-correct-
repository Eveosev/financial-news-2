(Corrects Sall’s position in second paragraph.)  Senegal named Moustapha Sourang as
head of the country’s armed forces, moving former chief Becaye
Diop to the urban environment ministry, Agence de Presse
Senegalaise reported, without saying how it got the information.  Khadim Gueye was replaced by Hamath Sall at the agriculture
ministry, while Gueye moves to the ministry of public service
and employment, the Dakar-based  news agency  reported on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
