Dexia SA (DEXB) , the bank being broken up
after running out of short-term funding, said a draft agreement
reached between Belgium, France and Luxembourg for temporary
guarantees has been submitted to the European Commission.  Dexia, rescued by the governments in October for the second
time in three years, obtained as much as 45 billion euros ($60.6
billion) in guarantees from the three states to cover its
financing needs until the end of May, the Paris- and Brussels-
based bank said in a statement today. The support, which reduces
the firm’s dependence from central banks, will help the lender
complete its planned asset sales, it said.  Dexia rose as much as 11 percent to 39 cents and was up 7.4
percent at 38 cents by 10:28 a.m. in Brussels trading, giving
the bank a market value of 739 million euros. The stock has
fallen 85 percent this year.  The temporary guarantee is “the first step” from the
three governments to provide as much as 90 billion euros, Dexia
said.  Belgium  is taking on 60.5 percent, France 36.5 percent and
Luxembourg 3 percent. “It is an irrevocable, unconditional,
direct, autonomous and first demand guarantee,” the company
said.  Dexia, once the world’s largest municipal lender, said Nov.
9 its shareholder equity shrank 84 percent after the
nationalization of its Belgian bank unit and declines in the
value of government-bond holdings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
