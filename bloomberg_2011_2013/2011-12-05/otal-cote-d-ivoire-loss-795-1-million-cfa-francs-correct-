(Corrects previous year’s revenue in second paragraph.)  Total Cote d’Ivoire SA said it made a
loss of 795.1 million CFA francs, compared with a profit of 2.22
billion francs a year earlier, because of the post-election
crisis in the West African country.  Revenue dropped 9 percent to 99.9 billion francs from 109.9
billion francs, the fuel retailer said in a statement today to
the Abidjan-based Bourse Regionale des Valeurs Mobilieres.  To contact the reporter on this story:
