CST Mining Group Ltd. (985) , a Hong Kong-
listed mining company, is looking to sell its Peru copper
project at around the same price offered by  Glencore
International Plc , which subsequently ended the proposal.  CST Mining is being approached by many interested parties,
Vice Chairman Owen Hegarty told reporters today in Hong Kong.
“It’s a good value price” and the fundamentals of the mine are
still good, Hegarty said.  Glencore terminated the deal to buy 70 percent of the Mina
Justa project for $475 million because it couldn’t reach
agreement with joint-venture partner Marcobre S.A.C., Hong Kong-
based CST Mining said in a Nov. 30 statement. Not all conditions
for the sale were met by the deadline and the transaction was
terminated, Glencore said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
