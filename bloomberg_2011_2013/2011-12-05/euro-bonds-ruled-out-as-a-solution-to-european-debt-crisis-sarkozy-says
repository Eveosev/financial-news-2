Bonds issued jointly by all members
of the euro zone are “in no case” a solution to the euro
zone’s crisis, French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said.  “Germany and  France  are not going to pay the debts of

Sarkozy said at a joint press conference with German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
