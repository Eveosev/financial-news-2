Indian stocks fell on speculation the
biggest weekly gain in shares in more than two years was
excessive as inflation and high  interest rates  continue to
threaten corporate profits.  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , the nation’s largest producer, lost 2.2
percent after jumping 12 percent last week.  ITC Ltd. (ITC) , the
biggest cigarette maker, fell for the first time in six days.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, dropped 0.2
percent, to 16,821.82, according to preliminary closing prices
at the 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the
National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. lost 0.2 percent to
5,039.15. The  BSE 200 Index (BSE200)  fell 0.1 percent. The markets are
closed tomorrow for a public holiday.  “The strong momentum we saw was symptomatic of a relief
rally and I doubt whether there is underlying strength for the
market to follow this through,” Vineet Bhatnagar, managing
director of MF Global Sify Securities  India  Pvt., said in an
interview with Bloomberg UTV today. “The market will find it
difficult to break 5,100” level on the Nifty index, he said.  The Sensex had its steepest weekly rally since July 2009
last week on expectation the nation’s central bank may pause its
record series of interest-rate increases after the economy grew
at the slowest pace in two years. The measure has still sunk 18
percent this year as a weakening rupee, accelerating inflation,
record borrowing costs and  Europe ’s debt crisis erode profits,
prompting foreign funds to cut equity holdings by $2.6 billion
from a record in July. The slide has narrowed the valuation of
the companies on the gauge to 14.5 times future profits, near
the lowest level since May 2009. The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) 
is valued at 10.3 times.  Overseas  investors  bought a net 9.05 billion rupees ($176
million) of Indian stocks on Dec. 1, paring their withdrawals
from equities this year to 17.7 billion rupees, according to
data from the  Securities & Exchange Board of India .  To contact the reporter on this story:
