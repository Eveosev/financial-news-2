Japan ’s  bonds  rose, pushing down 10-
year yields from a four-month high, as concern Europe is headed
for a recession supported demand for refuge assets.  Benchmark bond futures advanced for a fourth day before
data tomorrow forecast to show Europe’s economic growth stalled
in the third quarter. Treasuries gained in  New York  on Dec. 2,
breaking a five-day losing streak.  “The odds for a European recession are more than 50
percent,” said  Takeshi Minami , the Tokyo-based chief economist
at Norinchukin Research Institute Co. “Demand for Japan’s bonds
as a safe asset is likely to increase further.”  Japan’s benchmark 10-year  yield  fell three basis points to
1.045 percent at 3:09 p.m. in  Tokyo  at Japan Bond Trading Co.,
the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.1 percent
security due December 2021 added 0.272 yen to 100.497 yen. The
rate touched 1.09 percent on Dec. 1, the highest since July 29.  Twenty-year yields dropped 2 1/2 basis points to 1.775
percent. Ten-year bond futures for December delivery gained 0.09
to 142.17 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  An  estimate  of Europe’s gross domestic product will show it
grew 0.2 percent in the third quarter, the same pace as the
second quarter, according to the median forecast of economists
in a Bloomberg News survey before the report.  Growth of  factory orders  in  Germany , Europe’s biggest
economy, slowed to 1.9 percent in October from 2.4 percent the
previous month, a separate survey showed before the data are
released tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
