South  Korea ’s won advanced, after
fluctuating between gains and losses, as U.S. jobs data eased
concern that the world’s biggest economy is slowing.  Employment in the U.S. climbed by 120,000 workers in
November, after a 100,000 gain the prior month, Labor Department
figures showed on Dec. 2. Jobless rate fell to 8.6 percent, the
lowest level since March 2009. Italian Prime Minister  Mario
Monti  announced 30 billion euros ($40 billion) of austerity and
growth measures yesterday as he seeks to cut debt and prevent a
breakup of the euro. European Union leaders hold a summit on
Dec. 9 to help resolve the sovereign-debt crisis.  “U.S. job data is good news, and investors will also be
paying attention to what happens in Europe this week, the
European Central Bank’s rate meeting and the EU summit
decisions,” said Jeon Seung Ji, a currency analyst at Samsung
Futures Inc.  The won advanced 0.1 percent to 1,129.80 per dollar in
 Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
strengthened as much as 0.4 percent earlier, trimming gains on
speculation importers sold the local currency for dollars to
settle bills, according to Lee Jung Hyun, a foreign-exchange
dealer at Seoul-based Industrial  Bank of Korea .  The Bank of Korea will keep its  benchmark interest rate  at
3.25 percent on Dec. 8, according to all ten economists surveyed
by Bloomberg. The ECB unexpectedly lowered the benchmark
borrowing cost by 25 basis points to 1.25 percent last month.
Officials may cut rates again to 1 percent when they meet on
Dec. 8, according to 52 of 56 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News.  The yield on  South Korea ’s 3.5 percent bonds due September
2016 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.49
percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
