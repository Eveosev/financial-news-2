Minsur SA (MINSURI1) , the world’s fourth-largest
tin producer, aims to quadruple production at the Pitinga mine
in  Brazil  in four years, Chief Executive Officer Lucio Pareja
said.  Pitinga “should be reaching the 10,000 metric tons-per-
year level eventually,” Pareja said in an interview in London
today. The mine’s current output of 2,500 tons of tin should
reach 5,000 to 6,000 tons next year, he said.  Production at the San Rafael mine in Peru will likely stay
at 29,000 tons next year, Pareja said on the sidelines of a
seminar held by  St. Albans , England-based industry group ITRI
Ltd.  Minsur, located in  Lima , produced about 36,000 tons of
refined tin last year, according to ITRI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
