The premium buyers are willing to pay
for white, or refined sugar from  Brazil  fell in the past week as
sales increased before extra exports from  India  and the European
Union, according to Swiss Sugar Brokers.  White sugar in containers from the South American country
was at $60 a metric ton above the March contract on
the NYSE Liffe exchange as of Dec. 3, down from $75 a ton a week
earlier, data from the brokerage show. White sugar in bulk was
at a premium of $45 a ton, down from $65, it said.  The EU approved additional exports of 700,000
tons of sugar in Nov. 24, according to the European Commission,
the bloc’s regulatory arm. India, the world’s second-largest
producer and biggest consumer, allowed 1 million tons of exports
on Nov. 22, Vilasrao Deshmukh, minister for science and
technology, said in  New Delhi  that day.  The premium on Brazilian white sugar has started “waning
ahead of EU non-quota exports,”  Naim Beydoun , a broker at the
Rolle, Switzerland-based company said in a report dated Dec. 3.
There is a “race” to get sugar shipped before the Indian
exports start, he said.  White, or refined, sugar for March delivery advanced 1.6
percent to $623.20 a ton by 1:50 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London .
Brazil is the biggest producer of sugar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
