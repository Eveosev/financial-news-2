The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities rose 0.5 percent to 661.69 as of 4:44 p.m. in
 Singapore . The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
advanced 0.2 percent to 1,554.775.  CRUDE OIL  Oil rose for a second day in  New York  on concern that
tension in the  Middle East  threatens supplies and speculation
that Europe will take steps to tame a debt crisis that may curb
economic growth.  Crude for January delivery climbed as much as 77 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $101.73 a barrel in electronic trading on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices gained 4.3 percent last week, 
the first increase since the period ended Nov. 11, and are up 14 
percent the past year.  NATURAL GAS  OIL PRODUCTS  Asian refining margins for naphtha fell for a second day
amid signs of slowing economic growth in  China , the world’s
largest energy consumer.  Naphtha’s premium to  Brent crude  slipped 5.7 percent today
to $61.95 a metric ton at 1:31 p.m. Singapore time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. December swaps for naphtha, a
petrochemicals and gasoline feedstock, climbed 0.8 percent to
$897.75 a ton at 11:49 a.m. Singapore time, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd, a London-based broker.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude dropped 51 cents, or 2.8
percent, to $17.47 a barrel today, falling for the first day in
three, PVM data showed. January swaps for gasoil gained 20
cents, or 0.2 percent, to $124.85 a barrel. Jet fuel’s premium
to gasoil, also known as the regrade , fell 10 cents to $1.30.  BASE METALS  Copper, zinc and aluminum declined as equities fell on
concern that the Chinese economy may slow after non-
manufacturing industries contracted, possibly damping demand
from the largest consumer of the metal.  Three-month delivery copper declined as much as 0.6 percent
to $7,844.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, and
traded at $7,870 a ton by 3:11 p.m. Shanghai time. Copper for
February delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange dropped 0.2
percent to close at 57,960 yuan ($9,110) a ton.  PRECIOUS METALS  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, LIVESTOCK  Soybeans advanced, after climbing for the first week in
five last week, on signs that the U.S. economic recovery is
gaining momentum and  Europe  is moving toward trimming its debt.
Corn and wheat declined.  January-delivery soybeans gained as much as 0.8 percent to
$11.4425 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and were at
$11.41 at 3:23 p.m. in Singapore. Futures rose 2.6 percent last
week, the first gain since the five days ended Oct. 28.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cocoa fell to a 32-month low on Dec. 2 on signs of rising
supplies in  Ivory Coast  and  Ghana , the world’s biggest
producers. Sugar and coffee also dropped.  Cocoa for March delivery dropped 2.6 percent to settle at
$2,228 a metric ton at 12:12 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, after touching $2,218, the lowest for a most-active
contract since March 2009. Prices have slumped for seven
straight sessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
