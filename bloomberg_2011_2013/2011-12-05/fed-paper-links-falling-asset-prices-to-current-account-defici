Declining stock and housing prices
after the 2007-2009 financial crisis may be helping to reduce
the current-account deficits of the U.S. and other countries,
according to a paper by the  Federal Reserve Bank of San
Francisco .  “Falling asset prices have brought current-account
deficits back to more sustainable levels and helped restore a
better global financial balance,” said Paul Bergin, a professor
at the University of  California , Davis, who is a visiting
scholar at the bank. Bergin’s comments were made in a paper
released by the San Francisco Fed today.  The author links rising property and equity prices before
2007 to higher consumer borrowing and consumption, along with a
widening shortfall in the U.S.  current account , the broadest
measure of a country’s net exports to the rest of the world. The
gap widened from 1991 to 2006, reaching more than 6 percent of
national output, and has shrunk by half since the crisis, he
said.  “Current-account imbalances should be taken seriously as
warning signs of potential future financial crises,” Bergin
wrote. “It also suggests that the sharp fall in asset prices
stemming from the 2007-2009 financial crisis has served as a
mechanism of global financial adjustment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
