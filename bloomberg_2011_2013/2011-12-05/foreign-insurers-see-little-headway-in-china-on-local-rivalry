Foreign insurers expect little
progress in expanding their market share in  China  in the next
three years as competition from local rivals increases,
according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP survey.  Seven out of 18 overseas life insurers forecast their share
to be unchanged at 5 percent in 2014, according to the results
of a survey released today. Six of the 10 property and casualty
insurance companies that participated expect their slice to
remain at about 1 percent, the lowest foreign presence in  Asia .  Increasing competition from Chinese insurers such as  China
Life Insurance Co. (2628)  replaced  government regulation  as the biggest
challenge for insurance companies operating in China for the
first time in the five years the accounting firm has conducted
the survey, PwC said. The entry of local banks poses new
challenges, and the rising cost of living is making talent
retention and recruitment more difficult, according to the
survey.  Still, participants view China as a “very attractive”
market due to its rapid economic growth and low penetration
levels, PwC said. Twelve life insurers envisage premium growth
rates above 30 percent by 2014, while property and casualty
companies mostly expected growth in the 30 percent to 50 percent
range, according to the survey.  --Zhang Dingmin. Editors: Andreea Papuc  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
