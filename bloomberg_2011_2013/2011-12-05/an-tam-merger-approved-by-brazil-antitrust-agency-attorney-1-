Lan Airline SA (LAN) ’s $3.3 billion
acquisition of  Tam SA (TAMM4) ,  Brazil ’s largest airline by market value,
received a second recommendation of approval by Brazilian
authorities. Shares advanced.  Gilvandro Araujo, general attorney at Brazil’s antitrust
regulator, or Cade, recommended that the transaction proceed
without restrictions, according to a report distributed in
Brasilia.  Tam advanced as much as 1.8 percent on Araujo’s
recommendation after earlier falling 0.2 percent. Shares rose
0.4 percent to 35.01 reais at the close in  Sao Paulo .  “That’s positive news, as any step forward on this process
helps to reduce the uncertainty that still surrounds this
deal,” Rosangela Ribeiro, an analyst at SLW Corretora
brokerage, said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo.
“Investors will remain cautious until a final decision about
this deal is reached.”  In August, the Brazilian Finance Ministry body in charge of
analyzing mergers and acquisitions recommended the deal be
approved without restrictions. The deal still needs to be voted
on by Cade’s board. The antitrust regulator may start voting on
the deal as soon as Dec. 14, Araujo said in an interview from
Brasilia.  Santiago-based Lan,  Latin America ’s largest airline by
market value, agreed to buy Tam in an all-stock transaction on
Aug. 13, 2010. The combination follows similar tie-ups among
U.S. and European carriers trying to reduce operating costs and
increase revenue by offering a broader global market to
passengers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
