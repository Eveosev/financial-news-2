U.S. stocks rose, following the best 
weekly rally since 2009, as optimism that Europe will tame its 
debt crisis helped the market weather a late-day selloff on 
reports that euro-area nations' credit outlooks may be cut.  All 10 groups in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained,
with a gauge of  financial shares (S5FINL)  adding 2.1 percent.  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  advanced at least 2.6
percent. MetLife Inc., the largest U.S. life insurer, increased
3.7 percent after saying earnings will probably rise in 2012.
 Gannett (GCI)  Co., the owner of newspapers including USA Today, surged
10 percent as Lazard Capital Markets raised its recommendation.  The S&P 500 rose 1 percent to 1,257.08 at 4 p.m. New York
time, extending last week’s 7.4 percent rally. The benchmark
measure briefly traded above its  average price (SPX)  of the past 200
days of about 1,265 today. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
climbed 78.41 points, or 0.7 percent, to 12,097.83.  “There’s great potential reward, but great risk,”  James Paulsen , who helps oversee about $333 billion as chief
investment strategist at Minneapolis-based Wells Capital
Management, said in a telephone interview. “If you take  Europe 
out of the picture, valuations could jump dramatically. If
there’s disappointment, we can have a sizable decline.”  Italian borrowing costs dropped as Prime Minister Mario
Monti offered parliament a 30 billion-euro ($40 billion) package
of austerity and growth measures. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy pushed for a rewrite
of the EU’s governing rules to tighten economic cooperation.
Merkel and Sarkozy presented a common platform for a Dec. 8-9
summit of EU leaders in Brussels.  AAA Rated  Stocks pared gains in the afternoon as two officials
familiar with the S&P decision said the agency may downgrade
euro nations. After the market closed, S&P announced that it put
15 euro nations on review for possible downgrade. Germany,
France, Netherlands, Austria, Finland and Luxembourg, the euro
area’s six AAA rated countries, are among the nations being
placed on “creditwatch negative,” pending the result of the EU
summit, S&P said.  “This is a period where rating agencies have to be more
cautious,” Eric Teal, chief investment officer at First
Citizens Bancshares Inc., which manages $4 billion in Raleigh,
 North Carolina , said in a telephone interview. “It’s
conceivable that there will be more downgrades. There’s some
optimism building there that if Europe has a bold enough plan,
they could put some of the problems behind. We’re still
skeptical because of the many structural problems.”  Stocks rose even as a  report  showed that service industries
in the U.S. expanded in November at the slowest pace since
January 2010 as employment cooled.  Biggest Gains  Gauges of financial, technology and energy companies in the
S&P 500 rose at least 1.1 percent. The  Morgan Stanley (MS)  Cyclical
Index of companies most-dependent on economic growth gained 1.6
percent. The Dow Jones Transportation Average added 1.5 percent.  The KBW Bank Index rallied 2.7 percent as 23 of its 24
stocks gained. JPMorgan increased 3.7 percent, the most in the
Dow, to $33.51. Bank of America added 2.7 percent to $5.79.
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  jumped 5.9 percent to $29.83.  MetLife climbed 3.7 percent to $32.92. Next year’s
operating profit, which excludes some investment results, will
be $4.80 to $5.20 a share, the New York-based company said today
in a statement. That compares with the average $5.08  estimate (MET)  of
20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Gannett surged 10 percent, the biggest gain since September
2009, to $13.13. The company was raised to “buy” from
“neutral” at Lazard Capital Markets, which cited increased
chances for a dividend boost.  Hospital Shares  Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC)  soared 12 percent to $4.70, pacing
gains in hospital operators. A program to pre-approve Medicare
hospital payments for pacemakers and joint replacements is
limited to  Florida , a U.S. doctor’s group said. Hospital and
medical device stocks tumbled on Dec. 2 after a report said
 Medicare , the U.S. health plan for the elderly and disabled,
won’t pay for a range of heart and orthopedic procedures in 11
states until contractors confirm the care was appropriate.  SuccessFactors Inc. (SFSF)  surged 51 percent to $39.75. SAP AG,
the largest maker of business-management software, agreed to buy
the company for $3.4 billion in cash to keep pace with rival
Oracle Corp. in the cloud-computing market.  The  S&P 500  will climb to 1,360 next year as corporate
profits increase and European and U.S. officials make policy
changes, Gina Martin Adams of  Wells Fargo & Co . said.  That forecast would represent a 9.3 percent gain from its
close on Dec. 2 of 1,244.28. The level is about 13 times a blend
of estimated 2012 and 2013 earnings, Adams, a strategist at the
bank, said in a note dated today.  ‘Credible’  Adams predicts Europe’s debt crisis will push leaders in
the region to offer a “credible” asset purchase program next
year, while global economic growth concerns will spur the U.S.
Federal Reserve to embark on a third round of quantitative
easing within the next 12 months. Her 2012 price forecast for
the benchmark equity index is in line with the 1,359 average of
nine strategists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Stocks will start the year troubled by ongoing sovereign
debt struggles in Europe,” New York-based Adams wrote in the
report. “European and U.S. policy makers will likely have to
create just the right mix of ingredients to fill the punchbowl
to the satisfaction of investors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
