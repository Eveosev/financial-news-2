Sebastian Pinera will announce
proposed changes to  Chile â€™s tax code in the first half of 2012
that will help fund social and education programs, Santiago-
based newspaper  Diario Financiero  reported, quoting the
president.  The government will work with the opposition on changes to
the tax system that will sustain growth during a global economic
slowdown and distribute wealth more evenly, the financial daily
 reported . Authorities will study whether to keep corporate taxes
at 20 percent rather than letting them fall to 17 percent as
currently planned, the paper reported.  Editor: Harry Maurer  To contact the reporter on this story:
