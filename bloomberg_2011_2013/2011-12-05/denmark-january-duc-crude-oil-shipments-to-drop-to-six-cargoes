Crude oil shipments from Dansk
Undergrunds Consortium, the producer part-owned by A.P. Moeller
 Maersk  A/S, are scheduled to drop to six cargoes in January, one
less than this month, according to a loading program.  Exports will total 3.6 million barrels, or 116,129 barrels
a day, the plan obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  Copenhagen-based  Maersk (MAERSKB)  holds 39 percent of the venture,
known as DUC.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  owns 46 percent and  Chevron
Corp. (CVX)  has 15 percent. Maersk will receive three cargoes, Chevron
will get two and Shell one, according to the schedule.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
