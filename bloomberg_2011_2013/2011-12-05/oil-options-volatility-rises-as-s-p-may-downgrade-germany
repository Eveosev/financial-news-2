Oil options volatility rose as the
underlying futures were little changed after  Standard & Poorâ€™s 
planned to say it may strip  Germany  and  France  of their AAA
credit ratings.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, rose to 34 at 4:15 p.m. in New York, from 33.3
on Dec. 2.  Oil erased earlier gains after reports that S&P may strip
France and Germany of their AAA ratings and put all 17 euro
nations on review for possible downgrade.  The most active options contracts in electronic trading
today were January $95 puts, with 1,494 lots changing hands at
4:18 p.m. The options fell 18 cents to 49 cents a barrel. Next
were February $90 puts, with 1,343 lots. They fell 21 cents to
$1.46. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Puts accounted for 45 percent of the volume.  Oil for January delivery rose 3 cents to settle at $100.99
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices moved
between $100.24 and $102.44. Oil is up 10 percent this year.  June $120 calls were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 7,700 lots changing hands. They increased
11 cents to $3.47. The next-most active options, June $85 puts,
declined 21 cents to $4.84 on volume of 6,100.  Calls accounted for 55 percent of 104,522 lots traded.  Open interest was highest for December 2012 $150 calls with
38,023 contracts. Next were December 2012 $80 puts with 35,453
contracts, and December 2012 $100 calls with 32,375.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  -- Editors: Richard Stubbe, Bill Banker  To contact the reporter on this story:
