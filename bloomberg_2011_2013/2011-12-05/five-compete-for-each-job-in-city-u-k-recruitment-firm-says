Five qualified candidates competed
for each job in  London ’s main financial district in November, a
jump from about 1.7 applicants at the start of the year,
according to a U.K. recruitment firm.  The ratio was the highest since December 2008 as the number
of investment bankers seeking employment rose, Astbury Marsden
said in a statement today. New vacancies at financial-services
companies fell 16 percent to 2,670 in November from a month
earlier as banks battle a faltering economy and a euro crisis,
the London-based company said.  “For those City staff who are looking for a new job it
means they are being pitted against more intense competition
then they may have faced for years,”  Mark Cameron , chief
operating officer at Astbury Marsden, said in the statement.
“For many it will mean more interviews and more rejections
before they find the right job.”  Financial companies in western  Europe  including  Barclays
Plc (BARC)  and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  have cut about 125,000 jobs this year,
according to Bloomberg data, as investment-banking revenue slows
amid the sovereign-debt crisis and banks face tougher  capital
requirements  from regulators.  MF Global Holdings Ltd., the parent company of the broker
once run by former New Jersey Governor and  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)  co-chairman  Jon Corzine , which employed about 2,870 people,
sought  bankruptcy protection  last month after a wrong-way bet on
European sovereign debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
