Spanish lenders that have received
support from the government’s  bank rescue fund  must publish
details of pay for executives and board members, the Bank of
 Spain  said.  Lenders affected by the new rule should publish the
information by Dec. 31, the Bank of Spain said in a regulatory
circular published on its  website  today. The information should
include details of pay, bonuses and pensions, the circular said.  Banks that haven’t fully paid back the rescue fund cannot
hand bonuses to executives without justifying them to the
regulator, the Bank of Spain said. Banks that report “mediocre
or negative” earnings should reduce variable compensation “in
a considerable way,” the Bank of Spain said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
