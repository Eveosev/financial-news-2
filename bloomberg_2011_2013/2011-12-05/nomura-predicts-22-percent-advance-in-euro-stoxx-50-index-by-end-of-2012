The Euro Stoxx 50 Index will rally 22
percent to 2,850 by the end of next year, Nomura Holdings Inc.
strategist  Ian Scott  said in a report.  “We expect substantial upside for stocks in 2012, as long
as the sovereign debt crisis does not turn into a series of
messy defaults,” Scott said.  The Euro Stoxx 50 rose 1.2 percent to 2,342.5 on Dec. 2.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
