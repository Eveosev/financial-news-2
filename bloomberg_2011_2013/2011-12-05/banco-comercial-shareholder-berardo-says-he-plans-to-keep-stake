Banco Comercial Portugues (BCP)  shareholder
Jose Berardo said he plans to keep his 6 percent stake in
Portugal’s second-largest listed bank.  “I maintain my position,” Berardo said in a telephone
interview. “I’m waiting for better days. It’s not reasonable to
sell at this point.”  Banco Comercial has dropped 76 percent this year. The bank
rose 4 percent to 13 cents a share at 3:44 p.m. in Lisbon
trading today.  After losing so much market value, it’s “possible” that
Banco Comercial will become a takeover target, Berardo said.  “All it takes is a capital increase for that to happen,”
he said. It would help Banco Comercial if the  Portuguese
government  paid back debt it owes to the country’s banks,
Berardo said.  Portugal ’s government said on Dec. 2 it planned to transfer
to the state as much as 6 billion euros ($8.1 billion) from
Portuguese banks’ pension funds and use part of that to pay off
part of the state’s debts that are held by banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
