The cost to protect U.S. bank debt
tumbled, led by  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , and a
benchmark gauge of company credit risk declined to the lowest in
more than a month as  Europe ’s leaders battled to stem the
region’s sovereign fiscal crisis.  Credit-default swaps on U.S. banks eased to the lowest
levels in a month. The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade
Index of credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, fell 4.8 basis points to a mid-price of 120.8
at 11:40 a.m. in New York, the lowest level since Nov. 4,
according to Markit Group Ltd.  Traders pushed the index lower for the sixth day as Italy’s
10-year yield dropped by the most in almost four months after
Prime Minister  Mario Monti  announced 30 billion euros ($40
billion) of austerity and growth measures to cut the nation’s
debt load. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  pushed for a rewrite of the European Union’s
governing treaties to tighten economic cooperation as a first
step to ending the debt crisis.  The index, which typically decreases as investor confidence
improves, has declined from 146 basis points on Nov. 25. It fell
last week by the most since March 2009 as investors wagered
Europe’s policy makers would prevent the region’s fiscal
upheaval from infecting bank balance sheets globally.  Contracts tied to the debt of Morgan Stanley declined 32.7
basis points to 382.2 basis points, the least since Nov. 3, and
those on Citigroup fell 22.4 to 227.3, the lowest level since
Oct. 28, the data show.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  declined 25.8 to 289.7, the least
since Nov. 2, and those on Bank of America’s debt eased 30 to
390, the lowest level since Nov. 15, according to CMA, which is
owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in
the privately negotiated market.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
