Duke University  received $50 million
from Bruce Karsh, president of  Oaktree Capital Management LP ,
and his wife to fund undergraduate scholarships.  The donation includes $30 million for U.S. students and $20
million for foreigners, the Durham, North Carolina-based
university said today in an e-mailed statement.  Karsh, a Duke trustee and 1977 graduate, co-founded Los
Angeles-based Oaktree in 1995. The private-equity firm has $73
billion under management, according to its  website . Martha Karsh
is an attorney and co-founder of an architecture and development
firm. Both Karshes attended the  University of Virginia  School of
Law and previously donated $35 million to Duke for financial aid.  “We are deeply grateful to the Karshes for this remarkable
gift and for the way they have championed one of the
university’s highest priorities,” Duke President Richard
Brodhead said in the statement. “This gift helps safeguard our
commitment to keeping a Duke education accessible to students
from a wide range of backgrounds.”  A portion of the donation will also be used to support
graduates from Knowledge is Power Program charter schools who
enroll at Duke. The total cost of attendance at Duke for
undergraduates is estimated to be $57,180 per year, according to
its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
