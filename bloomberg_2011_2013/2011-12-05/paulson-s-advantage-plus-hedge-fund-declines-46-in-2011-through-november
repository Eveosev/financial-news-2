John Paulson , the billionaire money
manager having his worst year, has lost 46 percent in 2011
through November in one of his largest hedge funds, according to
an investor update obtained by Bloomberg News.  Paulson’s Advantage Plus Fund, which seeks to profit from
corporate events such as takeovers and bankruptcies and uses
leverage to amplify returns, declined 3.6 percent last month.
The fund’s gold share class dropped 2.7 percent in November and
29 percent this year.  Paulson & Co., which is based in New York and manages $28
billion, has lost money this year on investments including
Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Sino-Forest Corp., the
Chinese forestry company accused by short-seller Carson Block of
overstating timberland holdings. Paulson, 55, cut the so-called
net exposure in his main  hedge funds  to 30 percent last month
and reduced bullish bets across all his funds.  Net exposure is calculated by subtracting the percentage of
a hedge fund’s short positions, or bets on falling securities,
from its longs, or wagers on rising stocks and bonds.  Armel Leslie , a spokesman for Paulson, declined to comment
on the firm’s returns.  Paulson’s biggest funds, Advantage Plus and Advantage,
employ similar strategies and have $11 billion in combined
assets. The dollar-denominated Advantage Fund fell 3.3 percent
in November and 32 percent this year. Its gold share class
slumped 1.5 percent last month and 13 percent in 2011. Paulson
investors can choose between dollar- and gold-denominated
versions for most of the firm’s funds.  Gold Fund  The Gold Fund, which can buy derivatives and other gold-
related investments, rose 1.3 percent in November and 11 percent
this year.  The Recovery Fund, which invests in assets Paulson believes
will benefit from a long-term economic upturn, fell 4 percent in
November and 28 percent this year. The gold share class declined
2.2 percent last month and 12 percent in the year’s first 11
months. Paulson has been betting on a U.S. economic recovery by
the end of 2012.  The Paulson Partners Enhanced Fund, which invests in the
shares of merging companies, decreased 0.6 percent last month
and 18 percent this year. Its gold share class advanced 0.7
percent in November and declined 0.9 percent in 2011.  Paulson’s Credit Opportunities Fund slumped 3.6 percent
