The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
jump 6.9 percent by the end of this month as the benchmark
measure completes a year-end rally, according to Peter Beuttell,
a technical analyst at MTS Research Ltd. in Bath,  England .  “If you look around the world, certain indexes didn’t look
like they recovered enough, so there is a chance that the
initial rallies could repeat,” Beuttell said in a telephone
interview today. “That supports the case for another rally
pattern, which is under way now.”  The “double zigzag” that began in October will continue
this month, with the  S&P 500  climbing to a  resistance level (SPX)  of
1,330 by the end of the year, Beuttell said. The gauge slipped
less than 0.1 percent to 1,244.28 on Dec. 2. The S&P 500 will
not drop to its support level of 1,120 to 1,160 until next year.  The S&P 500 has rebounded 13 percent from its October low
of 1,099.23.  “It’s seasonal for the market to rally,” Beuttell said.
“The year-end rally began with the October low.”  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
