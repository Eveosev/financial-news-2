Centro Retail Australia  shares began
trading today after  Centro Properties Group (CNP)  shareholders and
lenders agreed to a plan to wipe out A$2.9 billion ($3 billion)
of debt, allowing the creation of the new entity.  Centro Retail shares closed at A$1.74 in Sydney, valuing
the 1.34 billion of quoted securities at A$2.3 billion. The
benchmark  S&P/ASX 200 Index  rose 0.8 percent.  Centro first announced a planned restructuring in 2009
after a debt-fueled U.S. buying spree backfired with the global
financial crisis. Share and debt holders of Centro Properties
and listed unit Centro Retail Trust approved a proposal last
month to give lenders control of the new Centro Retail Australia
trust in exchange for forgiving debt.  “Enough of the corporate wreckage has been removed to
reveal the quality underlying assets,” JPMorgan Chase & Co.
analysts wrote in a Dec. 2 note, placing an “overweight”
recommendation on the Centro Retail Australia shares with a
price target of A$2.07. “With discipline, further efforts at
the corporate level should lock-in relative outperformance.”  The reorganization has been approved by the  Supreme Court 
of New South Wales, Centro said Dec 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
