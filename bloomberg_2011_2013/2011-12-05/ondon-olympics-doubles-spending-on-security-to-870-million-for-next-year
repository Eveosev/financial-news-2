The U.K. government doubled its
security budget for the  London  Olympics to 553 million pounds
($870 million) after a review found more staff was needed for
next year’s Games.  The increase, from the original 282 million pounds, won’t
force organizers to change the overall Olympic and Paralympic
budget of 9.3 billion pounds, according to a government
 quarterly report  released today.  The government more than tripled its original budget after
failing to get companies to finance and develop the site. Led by
two-time Olympic gold medalist Sebastian Coe, London beat bids
from Paris,  New York  and Moscow in July 2005 after telling the
 International Olympic Committee  that the 30th Olympiad would
regenerate east London. After completing much of the
construction, organizers are looking at crowd control and other
security issues.  “As the development of venue security plans has evolved,
so too has the requirement for security personnel at Games time
to support them,” the government said in the quarterly review.
“Accordingly, further funding is being made available.”  The new budget will pay for 23,700 security personnel, up
from the original 10,000, and the associated recruiting and
training costs. They will guard more than 100 venues, the
government said.  The increases in spending on security and other parts of
the Olympics has cut the event’s contingency fund to 354 million
pounds from the 587 million pounds budgeted after a 2010
spending review, the government said. There have been savings in
other areas, including a projected 132 million pound reduction
in construction costs.  No Specific Threat  The government said the security increase “is not in
response to any specific security threat.”  The Games start July 27, 2012. China spent $70 billion on
the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, and the 2004 Athens Games cost
more than 11 billion euros ($14.8 billion).  To save money, London is building  temporary facilities  or
re-using arenas, such as Horse Guards’ Parade for the beach
volleyball, Greenwich Park for equestrian sports and Wembley
stadium for soccer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
