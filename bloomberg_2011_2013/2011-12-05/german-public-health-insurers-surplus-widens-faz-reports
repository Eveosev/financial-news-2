German public health insurers posted
a surplus in the first nine months that probably exceeded the
2.4 billion euros ($3.2 billion) recorded in the first half of
this year,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  said, citing
unpublished figures reported to the Berlin-based health
ministry.  Two thirds of the public health insurers together had a
surplus of 3 billion euros after the first three quarters, the
newspaper said, adding the health ministry will publish official
figures in coming days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
