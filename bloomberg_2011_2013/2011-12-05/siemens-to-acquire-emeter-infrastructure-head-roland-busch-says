Siemens AG (SIE)  has agreed to acquire
eMeter Corp., a smart metering company based in California, to
add services offered to its infrastructure and cities operation,
Roland Busch, head of the division, said today.  Busch declined to give details on the purchase of eMeter,
which makes software for utilities. Siemens partnered with
eMeter in early 2008 to jointly market the U.S. company’s
software, according to Siemens’s website.  eMeter’s customers include  Alliant Energy Corp. (LNT) , based in
Wisconsin, and Long Island Power Authority, which supplies 1.1
million customers in New York, according to the U.S. company’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
