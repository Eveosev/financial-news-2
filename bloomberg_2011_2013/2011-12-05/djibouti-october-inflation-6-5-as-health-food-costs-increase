Inflation in Djibouti accelerated to
6.5 percent in October as health costs and the prices of some
foods increased, the Department of Statistics and Demographic
Studies said.  The inflation rate climbed from 4 percent in September, the
Djibouti City-based agency said in an e-mailed statement today.
Prices rose 0.5 percent in the month, it said. Health costs
advanced 2.7 percent, as prices of vegetables jumped 7.3 percent
from September, it said.  Djibouti, which hosts about 2,500 U.S. military personnel
at the Camp Lemonnier military base, is a Horn of Africa nation
about the size of  Massachusetts . The country has a $982 million
economy with fewer than 1 million people that relies on services
related to its strategic location on the  Red Sea , one of the
worldâ€™s busiest shipping lanes, according to the U.S. State
Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
