The  International Monetary Fund  has
urged  Greece  to ensure that the countryâ€™s banks remain privately
managed even if they need state recapitalization through the
Hellenic Financial Stability Fund,  Imerisia  reported, citing an
IMF report.  Greek banks should try to meet fresh  capital requirements 
arising from writedowns of Greek sovereign debt through the
private sector where possible, the IMF said in the report on
Greece, according to the Athens-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
