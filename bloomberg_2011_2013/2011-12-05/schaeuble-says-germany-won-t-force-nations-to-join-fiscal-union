Germany  won’t force European Union
countries to join the stronger budget oversight it is proposing
to stem the sovereign-debt crisis in the euro area, Finance
Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said.  “We have repeatedly taken the step in  Europe  that we say
some of us press ahead,” Schaeuble said in a speech in Budapest
today. “Of course, with everything we do now, we have to make
it clear that the gap between the 17 and the 10 doesn’t get
bigger.”  Schaeuble’s message that the 10 EU members that don’t use
the euro won’t be excluded came at the start of week of crisis
meetings culminating with a Dec. 8-9 summit of all 27 leaders,
where Germany aims to set the region on the path to a fiscal
union. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  were meeting in Paris today to prepare the way.  “We want to propose very clearly that everything we do in
terms of treaty changes, we do with all of the 27,” Schaeuble
said. “Non-euro members are invited to take part.” Euro
countries “are not an instrument to create a two-class Europe
in the long run.”  The euro area needs to create a fiscal union and should
have veto powers over national budgets, he said. The EU has to
regain the confidence of the financial markets and stabilizing
the euro is a “major challenge.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
