Deforestation in  Brazil ’s Amazon fell
to the lowest rate since the government started monitoring the
world’s biggest rainforest in 1988, said the head of the
country’s space agency.  Deforestation fell to 6,238 square kilometers (2,408 square
miles) in the 12 months through July, from 7,000 square
kilometers in the year-earlier period, Gilberto Camara, head of
the National Institute of Space Research, also known as Inpe,
told reporters in Brasilia. This year’s area is twice the size
of  Rhode Island .  “This figure corresponds to the lowest number that Inpe
has estimated since the beginning of monitoring in 1988,”
Camara said.  The “relentless combat done by the Brazilian government”
was the main reason for the reduction of deforestation in the
Amazon, Science and Technology Minister Aloizio Mercadante told
reporters in Brasilia today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
