Getty Petroleum Marketing Inc., a
fuel marketer acquired this year by Cambridge Petroleum Holding
Inc., filed for  bankruptcy protection  to deal with environmental
cleanup costs.  The company, based in East Meadow, New York, listed assets
and debt of more than $50 million each in Chapter 11 documents
filed today in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan. Its Gasway
Inc., Getty Terminals Corp. and PT Petro Corp. units also sought
protection.  Bankruptcy “will enable Getty to emerge operationally
stronger with a better balance sheet” and “hasten
environmental cleanup,” Chief Executive Officer Bjorn Q. Aaserod said in a statement.  Bionol Clearfield LLC is listed as the largest unsecured
creditor. Its $230 million claim, resulting from an arbitration
award over an ethanol-supply contract, is listed as
“disputed.”  Getty Petroleum, formed in 1997, acts as a liaison for
about 765 leases between landlords and gas station operators and
other businesses, according to court papers.  Lukoil OAO (LKOH)  sold the
company to closely held Cambridge in March for an undisclosed
price.  The case is In re Getty Petroleum Marketing Inc., 11-15606,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
