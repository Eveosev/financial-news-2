Joao Havelange, the longest-serving
member of the  International Olympic Committee , has resigned from
the organization.  The departure of the 95-year-old, who had been a member of
the Lausanne, Switzerland-based committee since 1963, was
confirmed by the IOC in a text message today.  FIFA, soccer’s governing body for which the Brazilian is
honorary president, said in a statement it had “taken note” of
his resignation, but “cannot speculate on any decisions made by
Mr. Havelange.”  The British Broadcasting Corp.’s “Panorama” program said
last year that Havelange received $1 million from ISL, which
owned World Cup television rights and collapsed with debts of
$300 million in 2001, prompting an investigation by the IOC
ethics commission.  Havelange has denied the allegations. FIFA has promised to
release documents this month naming officials who took payments
from its former marketing partner.  “Regarding the ISL case, the FIFA Executive Committee
decided on 21 October to publish the dossier and to submit it to
an external committee for investigation,” FIFA said. “This
committee will then propose -- if necessary -- sanctions against
FIFA members who are guilty of misconduct.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
