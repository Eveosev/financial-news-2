Lan Airline SA’s (LAN)  $3.3 billion
acquisition of  Tam SA ,  Brazil ’s largest airline by market value,
received a second recommendation of approval by Brazilian
authorities.  Gilvandro Araujo, general attorney at Brazil’s antitrust
regulator, or Cade, recommended that the transaction proceed
without restrictions, according to a report distributed in
Brasilia.  In August, the Finance Ministry body in charge of analyzing
mergers and acquisitions in Brazil had already announced its
recommendation to approve the acquisition also without
restrictions. The deal still needs to be voted on by Cade’s
board. The anti-trust regulator may start voting on the deal as
soon as Dec. 14, Araujo said in an interview from Brasilia.  Santiago-based Lan,  Latin America ’s largest airline by
market value, agreed to buy Tam in an all-stock transaction on
Aug. 13, 2010. The combination follows similar tie-ups among
U.S. and European carriers trying to reduce operating costs and
increase revenue by offering a broader global market to
passengers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
