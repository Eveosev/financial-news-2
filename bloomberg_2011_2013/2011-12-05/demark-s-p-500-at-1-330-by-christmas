The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  may
advance to between 1,330 and 1,345 this month before the rally
reverses, according to Tom DeMark, the creator of indicators to
show turning points in securities.  That would represent a rise of at least 5.8 percent for the
benchmark gauge for American equities after the worst
Thanksgiving-week drop since 1932 depleted sellers, said DeMark,
whose prediction in September that the S&P 500’s decline would
stop at 1,076 proved prescient when the index bottomed at
1,074.77 on Oct. 4. This month’s rally will end when the S&P 500
closes higher on four successive days, DeMark said.  “I had the strongest short-term buy signal I’ve recorded
in 40 years” during the week of Thanksgiving, which fell Nov.
24, said DeMark, the founder of Market Studies LLC, in a phone
interview. “It’d be an explosive move to the upside.”  The  S&P 500  posted the biggest gain since March 2009 last
week, rising 7.4 percent, after six central banks made it easier
for lenders to obtain U.S. dollars in emergencies and a report
showed the American jobless rate dropped to 8.6 percent from 9
percent. The S&P 500 rose 1 percent to 1,257.08 today after
 Italy ’s  Mario Monti  proposed budget cuts and Germany and  France 
pushed for a new European Union treaty to fight the debt crisis.  Credible Market Action  “Today’s action is credible,” DeMark said in an interview
after the close of regular trading on U.S. exchanges on
Bloomberg Television’s “Street Smart” hosted by Lisa Murphy
and  Adam Johnson . “Today was a good job for the market, there
was some risk that it could move lower, but fortunately the
buyers came in after a weekend and that is usually a pretty good
sign.”  DeMark, who has spent more than 40 years developing
indicators with names like “sequential” and “countdown,”
said on Oct. 25 that a rally by the S&P 500 above 1,254 would
“trap” bulls. The index peaked three days later, then dropped
9.8 percent through Nov. 25.  “The market should top out around Dec. 21,” DeMark said
today. “The market rhythm and market balance equilibrium all
require the market rally. Once that’s completed, the market will
have a vacuum on the downside and we should have a sharp
decline.”  DeMark, an adviser to Steven A. Cohen’s SAC Capital
Advisors LP, provided consulting to hedge funds including George Soros’s Soros Fund Management LLC and Leon Cooperman’s Omega
