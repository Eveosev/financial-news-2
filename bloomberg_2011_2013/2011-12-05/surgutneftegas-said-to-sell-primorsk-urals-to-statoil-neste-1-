OAO Surgutneftegas, a Russian oil
producer, sold three cargoes of Urals crude via a tender to
 Statoil ASA (STL)  and Neste Oil Oyj for loading from the Baltic Sea
port of Primorsk this month, two traders who participate in the
market said.  Neste got the cargo for loading from Dec. 22 to Dec. 23,
while Statoil was awarded two shipments for Dec. 23 to Dec. 24
and Dec. 26 to Dec. 27, according to the people, who declined to
be identified because they arenâ€™t authorized to speak on the
matter. Each consignment is 100,000 metric tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
