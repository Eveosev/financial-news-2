Duke University ’s  Mike Krzyzewski  and
the University of Tennessee’s Pat Summitt were named Sports
Illustrated’s 2011 Sportsman and Sportswoman of the Year.  The two coaches, who have the most career wins at the top
level of men’s and women’s college basketball, will be honored
Dec. 13 in New York, Sports Illustrated said on its  website .  Krzyzewski, 64, passed mentor Bob Knight for the men’s
Division I coaching victory record on Nov. 15, when he won his
903rd game, and now has 907. He’s led the Blue Devils to four
national titles in 31 seasons, and has a record 79 wins in the
National Collegiate Athletic Association Tournament.  Summitt’s 1,075 wins are the most in college basketball
history. She’s led  Tennessee  to eight women’s national
