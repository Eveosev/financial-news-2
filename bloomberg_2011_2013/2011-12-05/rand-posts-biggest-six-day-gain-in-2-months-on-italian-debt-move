The rand appreciated and had its
biggest six-day gain in more than two months after Italian Prime
Minister  Mario Monti  introduced a proposal to cut his nation’s
debt, boosting appetite for riskier assets.  South Africa ’s currency strengthened as much as 0.7 percent
to 7.9892, its highest level on a closing basis since Nov. 11.
It traded 0.6 percent firmer at 7.9958 as of 9:31 a.m. in
Johannesburg, adding to last week’s 6.2 percent advance.  Standard & Poor’s  GSCI Index  of 24 commodities advanced 0.4
percent, a second day of gains. Monti will present the plan,
designed to reduce the euro-region’s second-biggest debt, to
policy makers in  Rome  today. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  is
scheduled to meet French President Nicolas Sarkozy to advance a
plan for stricter enforcement of the region’s deficit rules that
will be presented to European Leaders at a summit on Dec. 9.  “Weekend reports of a new austerity plan for  Italy  have
kept the mood risk-on, with the rand stronger this morning,”
Nomvuyo Guma, a Johannesburg-based currency strategist at
Standard Bank Group Ltd., and colleagues wrote in an e-mail.
“We anticipate that the rand’s strengthening bias will continue
as we head into the holidays. The rand has a cyclical tendency
to strengthen in December, which, barring renewed risk aversion
brought about by the euro zone, should keep it well supported
over the coming weeks.”  South Africa’s 13.5 percent bonds due 2015 declined for the
first time in six days, pushing up the yield 2.6 basis points,
or 0.026 percentage point, to 6.664 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
