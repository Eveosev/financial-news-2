Facebook Inc. is hiring Gowalla Inc.
employees, including co-founders Josh Williams and Scott Raymond, tapping the talent of a once-pioneering provider of
location-based services.  The group from Gowalla, which lets users share information
about their whereabouts by checking in to the site, will join
Facebook’s design and engineering teams, according to a
statement today.  “While Facebook isn’t acquiring the Gowalla service or
technology, we’re sure that the inspiration behind Gowalla will
make its way into Facebook over time,” Palo Alto, California-
based Facebook said in the statement. The company also won’t be
inheriting Gowalla’s user data.  The Gowalla team brings engineering staff to Facebook amid
rising competition with  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and Apple Inc. for
employees. Facebook also is opening an engineering office in  New
York , the first outside the West Coast, and plans to hire
thousands of employees in the next year, Chief Operating Officer
 Sheryl Sandberg (AAPL)  said last week.  Gowalla, a competitor to Foursquare Labs Inc. and Loopt
Inc., plans to wind down the service at the end of January.  “We know how much many of you loved Gowalla,” the Austin,
Texas-based startup  said on its blog . “It’s been the highlight
of our lives as we’ve built it with your help over the past two
years. As we move forward, we hope some of the inspiration
behind Gowalla -- a fun and beautiful way to share your journey
on the go -- will live on at Facebook.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
