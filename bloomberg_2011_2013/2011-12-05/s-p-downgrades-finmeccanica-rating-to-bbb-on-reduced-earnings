Finmeccanica SpA (FNC) , Italy’s biggest
defense company, had its long-term corporate  credit rating  cut
to BBB- with a ‘negative outlook’ by  Standard & Poor’s , which
cited lower earnings and restructuring of some of its divisions.  “We think that the announced suspension of dividends in
2012 is unlikely to counterbalance the company’s weakened
financial position,” the ratings company said in a statement
today. “Finmeccanica may be unable to improve its financial
risk profile in the near term.”  The Rome-based company’s credit rating was cut from BBB,
S&P said. The short-term rating was affirmed at A-3.  Finmeccanica said Nov. 15 it expects a full-year adjusted
Ebitda loss of 200 million euros ($269 million) compared with a
previous forecast of 1.6 billion euros for 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
