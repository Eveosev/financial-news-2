Kenya ’s shilling appreciated for the
first day in three on low dollar demand following an increase in
the benchmark interest rate.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy gained as
much as 0.4 percent to 89.50 per dollar before trading 0.3
percent higher at 89.55 at 11:20 a.m. in Nairobi, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Kenyan central bank raised the rate by 1.5 percentage
points to 18 percent on Dec. 1 to contain inflation after prices
rose more than double a government target. The worst regional
drought in 60 years and higher fuel prices helped spur inflation
to 19.7 percent in November from 18.9 percent in the previous
month, the National Bureau of Statistics said last month.  “The shilling has strengthened on account of low dollar
demand and a prevailing tight liquidity following the increase
in the benchmark rate by the central bank,” Duncan Kinuthia, a
dealer at Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said in
a phone interview today.  The Tanzanian shilling weakened 0.7 percent to trade at
1,676.15 to the dollar while Uganda’s currency gained for a
sixth day, rising 0.8 percent to 2,503 per dollar  To contact the reporter on this story:
