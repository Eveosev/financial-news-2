Neptune Orient Lines Ltd. , the
Singapore-based container line, denied reports that it planned
to bid for a stake in German shipping company Hapag-Lloyd AG.  “NOL wishes to state that currently, it is not making
another bid for a stake in Hapag-Lloyd,” it said in a stock
exchange statement today. “NOL evaluates investment
opportunities from time to time and will make the necessary
announcements when appropriate.”  Die Welt reported Dec. 3 that Neptune Orient had held
discussions with  TUI AG (TUI1)  on buying the Hanover, Germany-based
tourism company’s 38 percent stake in Hapag-Lloyd. TUI has
previously said it plans to offload the holdings to focus on its
holiday businesses.  NOL  rose 2.8 percent to S$1.12 in Singapore trading today.
The benchmark Straits Times Index declined 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
