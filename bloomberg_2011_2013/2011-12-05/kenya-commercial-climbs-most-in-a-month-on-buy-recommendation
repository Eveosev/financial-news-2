Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the
country’s third-biggest lender by market value, climbed for a
second day in three this month after Standard Investment Bank
initiated coverage of the stock with a “buy” recommendation.  The shares closed up 0.3 percent at 15.05 shillings as of 3
p.m. in the capital, Nairobi, matching the gain of Dec. 1.  “Based on our three years-out earnings forecasts, at
current market capitalisation there is 43.2 percent upside,”
for all publicly traded Kenyan lenders, Nairobi-based Standard
Investment said in an e-mailed note to clients on Dec. 2.  KCB, as the lender is known, has a fair value of 31.49
shillings over three years, giving it an upside of as much as
110 percent, according to the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
