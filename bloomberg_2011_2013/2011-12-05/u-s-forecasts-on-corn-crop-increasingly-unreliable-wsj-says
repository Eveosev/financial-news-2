The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
monthly corn crop estimates for last year’s harvest
overestimated the final harvest by 6 percent, more than twice
the error of most USDA crop estimates from 1998 to 2008, the
Wall Street Journal said, citing its own analysis.  The error was less than 3 percent in eight of the 11 years,
the Journal said. In 2009, the USDA underestimated the final
crop number by an average of 4.5 percent, the most since 2004,
it said. USDA estimates for this year suggest the crop is
overestimated by 10 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
