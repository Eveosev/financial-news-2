Young & Rubicam Group agreed to
become the anchor tenant at 3 Columbus Circle in midtown
 Manhattan , landlords  SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG)  and Moinian Group
said today.  The marketing and communications company, a unit of Dublin-
based  WPP Plc (WPP) , is buying a 214,372-square-foot (19,916-square-
meter) condominium interest and agreed to a 20-year lease for an
additional 124,760 square feet, New York-based SL Green said in
a statement. Terms weren’t disclosed.  The 26-story tower at 1775 Broadway covers the block
between Broadway and Eighth Avenue at the southwest entrance to
Central Park. Improvements being made to the property include a
new lobby and elevator cabs, according to the statement.  SL Green,  New York ’s biggest office landlord, bought a
stake in the building in January, forming a joint venture with
owner Joseph Moinian that protected him from a takeover bid by
Stephen Ross’s Related Cos., which controlled the building’s
mortgage. A settlement that month with Related allowed Moinian
to remain a partner in the redevelopment of the tower, which was
slowed by the 2008 credit crisis.  The condominium portion covers the third through eighth
floors and the lease is for floors nine, 10, 18 and 19,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
