Tin prices that have dropped 41
percent from a record in April may endanger smaller producers of
the metal, according to  Malaysia Smelting (SMELT)  Co.  “Twenty percent of the world’s producers will go out of
business at the current price level,” Chief Executive Officer
Mohammad Ajib Anuar said in an interview in  London  today. “It
can happen very quickly because they are sensitive to prices.”  Smaller producers of tin, used in solders that join metals
together and in packaging, face output costs of $20,000 to
$25,000 a metric ton, according to Anuar. Tin for delivery in
three months traded at $19,925 by 12:57 p.m. on the London Metal
Exchange, compared with the all-time high of $33,600 reached
April 11.  Malaysia Smelting produced about 45,000 tons of tin last
year, including its Indonesian operations, according to the CEO.
The company is the industry’s second-largest producer.  Producers in  Indonesia , which supplies 40 percent of global
exports, banned overseas deliveries as of Oct. 1 in an effort to
drive prices back to $25,000 a ton. Malaysia Smelting’s
Indonesian unit shipped 400 tons to  Singapore  on Nov. 26, the
first export since September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
