The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate debt fell, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 22.5
basis points to 722.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 7:30
a.m. in  London . A decline signals improved perceptions of  credit
quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was down 6.5 at 172.5 basis points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
