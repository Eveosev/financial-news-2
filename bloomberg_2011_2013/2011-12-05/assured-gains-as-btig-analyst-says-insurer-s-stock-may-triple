Assured Guaranty Ltd. (AGO) , the only
active insurer of new U.S. municipal bonds, rose in New York
trading after BTIG LLC said the shares may more than triple.  The insurer gained 98 cents, or 8.7 percent, to $12.23. The
stock has declined 31 percent this year.  BTIG analyst Mark Palmer initiated coverage on the
Hamilton, Bermuda-based company with a “buy” rating and $35
price target.  Standard & Poor’s  decision to allow  Assured
Guaranty  to maintain a rating in the AA tier will allow it to
gain business as “the only currently functioning monoline,” he
said.  S&P cut Assured Guaranty to AA- from AA+, according to a
Nov. 30 statement from the ratings company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
