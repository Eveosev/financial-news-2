Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened after
Exxon Mobil Corp. resumed normal operations at the Beaumont
refinery in  Texas .  The plant shut a compressor and expected “some impact to
production,” the company said in a Dec. 1 filing with state
regulators. Rachael Moore, a company spokeswoman, declined to
identify equipment returning to service.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast  widened 0.25 cent to 6 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:38 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
1.33 cents to $2.572 a gallon.  The same fuel in  New York Harbor  held at a premium of 4.25
cents a gallon against futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
