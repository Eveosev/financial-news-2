Ukraine may have to reseed between 30
percent and 35 percent of winter grains if snowfalls are
insufficient to protect plants from frost, UkrAgroConsult said.  Reseeding may be 27 percent to 28 percent of planted areas,
or 2.2 million to 2.3 million hectares (5.4 million to 5.68
million acres), if weather conditions are favorable, the Kiev-
based researcher said in e-mailed statement today.  Winter grains, mostly wheat, were planted on 8 million
hectares and plants sprouted on 6.18 million hectares as of Dec.
1, according to data on the  Agriculture Ministry â€™s website.
About 33 percent of the sprouted plants were in poor condition,
the data showed.  Thirty-three percent to 34 percent of winter rapeseed, or
300,000 to 400,000 hectares, will be reseeded in the spring even
if the weather is favorable, UkrAgroConsult said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
