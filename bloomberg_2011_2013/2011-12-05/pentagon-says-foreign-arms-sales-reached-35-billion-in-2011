The U.S. Defense Department struck
deals worth $34.8 billion in fiscal 2011 to sell weapons around
the world including  Afghanistan , Taiwan and  India , according to
a Pentagon statement today. It missed the agency’s goal of
exceeding $46 billion.  The top ten countries that reached agreement to buy U.S.
weapons under the Foreign Military Sales program also included
Australia,  Saudi Arabia , Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Israel,
 Japan , and Sweden, the  Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation
Agency  said in the annual statement.  The Pentagon had projected such government-to-government
sales would reach $36.3 billion for the year ending Sept. 30.
The agency fell short of the goal and got only $28.3 billion of
such orders. It also missed the overall goal of exceeding $46
billion for the year, including direct commercial sales.  Under the foreign military sales program, the Pentagon acts
as an agent between defense contractors and foreign buyers.  In April, Richard Genaille, deputy director of the Pentagon
agency responsible for sales, said fiscal year 2011 would exceed
$46 billion, “higher than ever” because of demand for jets and
air-defense systems.  One of the biggest items that did not go through in 2011
was a potential $6.95 billion sale of Theater High Altitude Area
Defense, or Thaad, made by  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  to the United
Arab Emirates. UAE has scaled back its request by one-third and,
if the sale goes through, the country will be the first
international buyer of the missile-defense system.  For 2012 export sales will “hover around $30 billion,”
the agency said in the statement. “But official projections are
still being calculated,” it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
