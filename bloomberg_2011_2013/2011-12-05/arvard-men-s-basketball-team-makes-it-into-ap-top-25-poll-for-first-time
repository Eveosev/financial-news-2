The Harvard University men’s
basketball team is No. 25 in this week’s Associated Press poll
and No. 24 in the coaches’ poll, the first time in the program’s
101-year history it’s been ranked among the best in the country.  The Crimson, 8-0, are the only unbeaten team in the  Ivy
League  with early season victories over Florida State (46-41),
which was in the Top 25 at the time, and Holy Cross (73-64).
Harvard, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, plays the University of
 Connecticut , ranked No. 9 in both polls, in Storrs, Connecticut,
on Dec. 8.  The University of  Kentucky  is ranked No. 1 in both polls
this week. The unbeaten Wildcats defeated the University of
 North Carolina  73-72 on Dec. 3.  Harvard is one of 15 undefeated teams in the country and
has a 19-game  home-court  win streak, tied with North Carolina
for seventh-longest in the nation, the school said in a press
release. Duke University and Kentucky share the nation’s longest
home victory run at 39. Harvard’s next home game is Dec. 22
against Florida Atlantic.  According to  CollegePollArchive.com , the Ivy League has had
six teams ranked in the AP Poll. The University of Pennsylvania
leads with 78 appearances, followed by  Princeton University 
(41),  Columbia University  (31), Dartmouth College (5), Yale
University (4) and  Cornell University  (3). Penn had the league’s
highest AP ranking at No. 2 after finishing the 1971-72 season
with a 25-3 record.  Top Players  Harvard is led by senior forward Keith Wright, of Suffolk,
Virginia (11.4 points, 6.8 rebounds per game), junior forward
Kyle Casey from Medway, Massachusetts (10.9 points, 5.2
rebounds), and sophomore guard Laurent Rivard of Saint-Bruno,
Quebec (10.1 points).  Cornell was the most recent previous Ivy team to be
nationally ranked after cracking the ESPN/USA Today Coaches’
poll for two weeks during the 2009-10 season. The Big Red
entered the poll at No. 25 on Feb. 1 and moved to No. 22 the
following week before dropping out. It ended the season back in
the coaches’ poll at No. 17.  Princeton is the last Ivy squad to be ranked among the top
25 in the AP poll. The Tigers’ 1997-98 team was No. 8 in the
final AP ranking and No. 16 in the final USA Today poll, which
was then conducted with the National Association of Basketball
Coaches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
