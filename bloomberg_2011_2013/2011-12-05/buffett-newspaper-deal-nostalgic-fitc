Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ’s deal to
acquire the Omaha World-Herald Co., publisher of the company’s
hometown newspaper, was “more nostalgic than strategic” by
Chairman  Warren Buffett ,  Fitch Ratings  said.  “Buffett appears to be showing a bit of sentiment,” the
ratings firm said today in a statement on Omaha, Nebraska-based
Berkshire.  Berkshire agreed to pay $150 million and assume debt, the
paper reported last week. Buffett has said newspaper buyers may
have motives other than profit, given declining readership and
competition from other information sources.  “For a local resident, ownership of a city’s paper, like
ownership of a sports team, still produces instant prominence,”
Buffett wrote in a  letter  accompanying Berkshire’s 2006 annual
report. “With it typically comes power and influence. These are
ruboffs that appeal to many people with money. Beyond that,
civic-minded, wealthy individuals may feel that local ownership
will serve their community well. That’s why Peter Kiewit bought
the Omaha paper more than 40 years ago.”  The newspaper deal is “very small” for Berkshire, Fitch
said. Buffett spent almost $9 billion this year to buy Lubrizol
Corp. and about $25.5 billion last year for the 77.5 percent of
railroad Burlington Northern  Santa Fe  that Berkshire didn’t
already own.  Berkshire is  rated  AA- by Fitch, the firm’s fourth highest
of 10 investment-grade levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
