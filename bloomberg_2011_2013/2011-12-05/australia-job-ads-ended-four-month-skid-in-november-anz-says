Australian job notices were unchanged
in November, ending a four-month skid, as companies delayed
personnel decisions during a bout of global financial turmoil, a
private report showed.  Jobs advertised  in newspapers and on the Internet held last
month after declining a revised 0.6 percent in October,
according to an  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) 
report released in Melbourne today.  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia cut  interest rates  last month
for the first time in 2 1/2 years, lowering the benchmark to 4.5
percent from 4.75 percent to boost demand as inflation pressure
eased. Hiring has weakened this year from a record in 2010 as
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis weighs on global growth.  “The tentative slowdown in the pace of job advertising
decline, if sustained, is an encouraging development as it would
signal only mild upward pressure on the unemployment rate, as
well as less pressure for Australian interest rates to fall much
further,” Ivan Colhoun, head of Australian economics and
property research at ANZ Bank, said in a statement.  ANZ predicts the RBA will lower borrowing costs by another
quarter percentage point tomorrow in an “insurance rate cut,”
Colhoun said.  National vacancies advertised in newspapers rose 0.6
percent in November, and Internet notices were broadly
unchanged, today’s report showed.  Australia ’s  unemployment rate  likely held at 5.2 percent in
November as employers added 10,000 jobs, a government report
will show on Dec. 8, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 22
economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
