Canadian Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty  said his government is ready to take additional steps
if needed to offset any worsening of the global outlook that
undermines the country’s labor market.  “Canada stands ready to respond again in a flexible and
pragmatic manner if the economic challenges from beyond our
shores begin to threaten jobs and the economy here,” Flaherty
said in speech today in Ottawa, according to a press release on
the finance department’s website.  European leaders must act decisively to resolve a debt
crisis that has become “very costly” and is threatening global
growth, Flaherty said in the speech. He said he may be in
contact with his European peers this week to discuss the issue.  Flaherty also said the most important contribution
government can make to bolster confidence and growth is to
maintain a sound fiscal position. He said next year’s fiscal
plan won’t have any big new spending measures, though he may
reallocate some funds toward priorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
