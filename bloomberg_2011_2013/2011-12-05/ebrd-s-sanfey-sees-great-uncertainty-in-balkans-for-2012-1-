Southeastern  Europe ’s economy will
face “great uncertainty” in 2012 because of “events taking
place globally,” said Peter Sanfey, the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development’s lead economist.  “Back in October, we expected 2 or 3 percent for the
region and 1.3 percent to 1.4 percent for Serbia,” Sanfey said
in a conference today in Belgrade. “But as of now, this looks
optimistic.”  The numbers “are more likely to go to a downward
direction” when the bank updates its forecasts in January, he
said.  The weaker growth will also result in lower current-account
deficits across the region, which includes Albania, Bosnia-
Herzegovina,  Bulgaria , Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania and
Serbia, mainly due to declining capital inflows, at least in the
short-term.  The EBRD expects its lending to  Serbia  this year to reach
530 million euros ($712 million) compared with 590 million euros
in 2010, the bank’s country manager Hildegard Gacek said, adding
that the lender had “a quite good target” for 2012 with a
continued focus on private businesses and helping create new
jobs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
