Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni
today will ask lawmakers from his ruling party to back  Tullow
Oil Plc (TLW) ’s $2.9 billion sale of its prospects in the East African
nation, the Daily Monitor reported.  Museveni will ask parliamentarians to backtrack on a
resolution to freeze new oil contracts, the Kampala-based
newspaper said, citing people it didn’t identify.  London-based Tullow said on March 30 that it agreed to sell
stakes in three oil blocks to  Total SA (FP)  and China National
Offshore Oil Corp., giving each company a third of Exploration
Areas 1, 2 and 3A in Uganda’s Lake Albert Basin. Ugandan
lawmakers voted in October to halt further oil transactions
until new laws governing the industry are implemented.  To contact the reporter on this story:
