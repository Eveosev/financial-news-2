The Philippine peso halted a four-day
advance on concern global economic growth will slow as  Europe 
crimps spending to resolve its debt crisis. Bonds were steady.  Gross domestic product rose less than analysts estimated in
the third quarter, climbing 3.2 percent from a year earlier, a
Nov. 28 government report showed. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey was for growth of 4.1 percent. Italian
Prime Minister  Mario Monti  will lobby parliament to support a 30
billion-euro ($40 billion) package of austerity measures to trim
the euro-region’s second-biggest debt.  “Although GDP growth was lower than expected, it’s
secondary to what’s happening in Europe,” said Rafael Algarra,
executive vice president at Security Bank Corp. “The market is
waiting for more impetus from the European situation.”  The peso closed at 43.272 per dollar in  Manila , compared
with 43.270 at the end of last week, according to Tullett Prebon
Plc. The currency advanced 1.6 percent in the Nov. 28-Dec. 2
period, the first weekly advance since October.  The yield on the government’s 12.25 percent notes due
October 2014 was little changed at 3.6 percent, according to the
noon fixing prices from the Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp.  Inflation  may have slowed to 4.9 percent last month, from
5.2 percent in October, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey before a government report
tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
