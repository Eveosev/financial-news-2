Manroland AG â€™s insolvency
administrator said he hopes to find buyers for parts of the
German printing-press maker,  Welt said , citing an interview with
the manager.  It will be difficult to find an investor for the company in
its current form, Werner Schneider said, according to the German
newspaper. Schneider has invited merger and acquisition advisers
to give presentations today, with the aim of mandating one or
two of them to find an investor, the newspaper said.  Werner is already talking to potential buyers, and
interested parties include financial as well as strategic
investors, Welt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
