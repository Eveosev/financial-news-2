Heating oil in New York rose to the
highest price in more than two weeks on speculation that fuel
demand will increase as Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
proposed budget cuts and leaders prepared to meet on Europe’s
debt crisis.  Futures advanced as much as 3 percent as Monti will present
a 30 billion-euro ($40 billion) plan to policy makers in Rome
today. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  is scheduled to meet
French President Nicolas Sarkozy to advance a plan for stricter
enforcement of the region’s deficit rules.  Oil products are rising on “optimism that the Europeans
will announce some deal later this week and also the Italian’s
introducing an austerity plan,” said Andy Lipow, president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Heating oil for January delivery gained 5.85 cents, or 2
percent, to $3.0485 a gallon at 9:47 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract rose to $3.0807, the highest
intraday price since Nov. 18.  The euro rose 0.6 percent to 1.3472. Germany is keen for
the IMF to adopt a “decisive role” in combating the crisis
alongside the European rescue fund, Michael Meister, the
parliamentary finance spokesman for Merkel’s  Christian
Democratic Union , said today in a telephone interview.  Gasoline for January delivery gained 2.44 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.6406 a gallon on the exchange.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.1
cent to $3.276 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data. It’s
the fifth consecutive drop and the lowest price since Feb. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
