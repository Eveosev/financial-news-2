Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields to two-week low, on speculation inflation slowed last
month because of cheaper food prices.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.54
percent, according to the stock exchange. That’s the lowest
since Nov. 18. The bond’s price rose 0.370 centavo to 119.517
centavos per peso.  “People have been cutting their inflation forecasts
because farmers have had to sell goods at lower prices as the
rains affect their quality,” said Felipe Campos, the head
analyst at brokerage Alianza Valores SA in Bogota.  Heavier-than-average rain, caused by the La Nina weather
pattern, will last through the first quarter of next year, the
government has said.  Consumer prices rose 0.19 in November, the same pace as the
previous month, according to the median estimate of 28
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The national statistics agency
is set to publish its monthly inflation report today at 7 p.m.
New York time.  The peso rose 0.3 percent to 1,935.55 per  U.S. dollar , from
1,940.57 on Dec. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
