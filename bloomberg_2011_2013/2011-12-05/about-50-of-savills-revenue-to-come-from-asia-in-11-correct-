(Corrects name of chief executive officer in first and

revenue will from  Asia  this year, from 40 percent in 2010,
driven by China, Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Helsby said in
Shanghai today.  In the next five years, the biggest growth in Asia will be
in China. London-based Savills’ revenue and profit from China
will grow 20 percent annually over the next five years, Helsby
said.  The real estate market in continental Europe is going to be
very, very tough in the next 12 years, Helsby said. Savills has
