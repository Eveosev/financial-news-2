Swedish Automobile NV , the owner of
 Saab Automobile , said it’s in talks to sell a stake to an
unidentified Chinese Bank to keep the carmaker in business.  The talks also involve  China ’s Zhejiang Youngman Lotus
Automobile Co. to enable Saab to pay November wages and continue
its reorganization, Swedish Automobile said in a statement
today. The outcome of the negotiations is uncertain and an
agreement would be subject to approval by stakeholders, it said.  The statement followed a Reuters report today that said
Youngman and Saab’s owner agreed that  Bank of China Ltd. (3988)  would
join as part-owner of the carmaker. The report was subsequently
corrected to say a Chinese bank would replace  Pang Da Automobile
Trade Co.  as an investor and own just under 50 percent of the
carmaker together with Youngman.  Pang Caiping, who heads Youngman’s negotiations team for
Saab, said today the company hasn’t held talks with Bank of
China.  Wang Ying , company secretary at Pang Da, said the company
was seeking to contact Saab for clarification. A Bank of China
press official, who declined to be named citing company policy,
had no comment on the report.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
