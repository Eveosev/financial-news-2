Craig Sedmak, the head of commercial-
mortgage bond trading at  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , has
left the bank, according to people familiar with the situation.  Sedmak, who was based in Stamford,  Connecticut , is
departing to pursue interests outside of financial services,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the move
hasn’t been made public. Sedmak and Pholida Phengsomphone, a
spokeswoman for RBS, declined to comment on the departure.  “RBS is committed to its CMBS origination and distribution
model that helped to reshape the current CMBS market,” said
Scott Eichel, global head of securitized products and head of
U.S. credit at RBS. “It’s one of our biggest growth sectors for
2012.”  RBS joined with Wells Fargo & Co. to sell $1 billion of
bonds last month backed by commercial mortgages, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sedmak joined RBS in 2008 after a decade working for Bear
Stearns Cos., according to records from the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. Jeffrey Wilson, Todd Jaeger and Cory Rothman will continue to trade commercial-mortgage bonds for the
lender in  Stamford , reporting to Adam Siegel, the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
