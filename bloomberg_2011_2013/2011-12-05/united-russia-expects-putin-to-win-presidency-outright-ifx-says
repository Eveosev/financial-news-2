Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin 
should win next March’s presidential election in the first
round, Interfax reported, citing a senior official in the
premier’s United  Russia  party.  “As soon as we lose our certainty, there will be nothing
left for us to do,” the news service cited Andrei Vorobyov as
saying.  Putin, who may be in power potentially for almost a quarter
century if he runs for president in 2018 as well, will need to
win more than 50 percent of the vote to avoid a run-off contest.
 United Russia  won 49.5 percent of yesterday’s parliamentary
elections to the State Duma, down from 64.3 percent in 2007, the
Central Election Commission said, citing preliminary results
from 96 percent of votes counted.  Putin, 59, was president from 2000 to 2008, when he handed
over to Dmitry Medvedev because of a constitutional bar on
serving three consecutive terms. Medvedev agreed in September to
step aside to allow Putin to return to the Kremlin next May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
