Ceske Aerolinie AS, the unprofitable
Czech state carrier, will dismiss as many as 100 pilots as part
of a streamlining of the airline, the company said.  The airline will start to dismiss pilots gradually starting
this week, Ceske Aerolinie, or CSA, said in an e-mailed
statement.  CSA had to cancel flights last week as some pilots didnâ€™t
show up for work to protest continuing restructuring of the
company.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
