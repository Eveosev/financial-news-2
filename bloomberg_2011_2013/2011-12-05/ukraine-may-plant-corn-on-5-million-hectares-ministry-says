Ukraine may plant 4 million to 5
million hectares (9.9 million to 12.3 million acres) of corn in
spring, up from 3.6 million hectares a year earlier after
drought damaged some winter grains, said Serhiy Kvasha, head of
the agriculture markets department at the  Agriculture Ministry .  “This would be a correct step and more productive use of
lands,” Kvasha told reporters in Kiev today. Farmers will also
plant more soybeans, he said.  Ukraine’s 2012 grain harvest is estimated at 40 million
tons, Kvasha said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
