Vietnam ’s 10-year bonds rose the most
since May, drawing funds after the nation’s inflation rate
dropped below 20 percent for the first time in six months. The
dong was steady.  Consumer prices  rose 19.8 percent from a year earlier in
November, after increasing 21.6 percent in October, according to
a Nov. 24 report from the General Statistics Office. The trade
deficit narrowed to $700 million last month from a revised $750
million in October, according to the statistics office.  “Demand for bonds may increase because the inflation rate
has dropped and the dong has been stable,” said Nguyen Tan Thang, head of fixed-income research at Ho Chi Minh City
Securities Corp. “Pressure on the  exchange rate  has eased
thanks to a lower trade deficit and more remittances being sent
back toward the end of the year.”  The  yield  on the government’s 10-year bonds fell 38 basis
points, or 0.38 percentage point, to 12.5 percent, according to
a daily fixing price from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
the biggest decline since May 13 and the lowest yield since
October.  The dong traded at 21,011 per dollar as of 4:24 p.m. in
Hanoi, from 21,016 at the end of last week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the  reference rate 
at 20,803, unchanged since Oct. 28, its website showed. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the official rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
