Alere Inc. (ALR) , a provider of health
management services, increased the size of a  term loan  it’s
seeking to refinance debt by $50 million to $250 million,
according to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  Alere is proposing to sell the loan at 97.5 cents on the
dollar compared with 97.5 cents to 98 cents originally offered,
said the person,who declined to be identified because the terms
are private. The discount reduces proceeds for the company and
boosts the yield to investors.  The financing, due in June 2017, will pay 3.5 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Libor, a rate banks charge to lend
to each other, will have a 1 percent floor.  GE Capital Markets, the lending unit of General Electric
Co., Jefferies Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG are
arranging the deal for the Waltham, Massachusetts-based company
and lenders must submit commitments by 3 p.m. tomorrow in  New
York .  David Teitel, chief financial officer of Alere, didn’t
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
