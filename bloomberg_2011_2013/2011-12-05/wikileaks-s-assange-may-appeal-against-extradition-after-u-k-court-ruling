The U.K.  Supreme Court  agreed to
consider WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange’s appeal against his
extradition to  Sweden  over sexual assault allegations.  A panel of three Supreme Court judges granted permission to
appeal an earlier court decision to extradite Assange. The
London-based court said it would review at a hearing in February
whether a prosecutor is a judicial authority with the power to
issue a European arrest warrant.  Assange has been fighting attempts by Swedish prosecutors
to put him on trial in the country since he was arrested in
 London  a year ago. The 40-year-old Australian is accused of rape
over incidents that took place in Stockholm and Enkoeping in
August 2010.  The issues raised in the case are of “great public
importance,” the court said in an e-mailed statement. A two-day
hearing was scheduled for Feb. 1.  The U.K. Court of Appeal rejected Assange’s latest bid to
block his extradition in November and said he must go to Sweden
to face the charges.  Assange says the sex was consensual and argues he won’t get
a fair trial in Sweden.  If the Supreme Court rejects Assange’s appeal, he can still
apply to the  European Court  of Human Rights in Strasbourg, the
U.K. Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
