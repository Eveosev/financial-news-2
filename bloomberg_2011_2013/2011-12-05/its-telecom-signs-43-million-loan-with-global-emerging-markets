Hits Telecom Holding Company, a
Kuwait-based telecommunications provider, agreed to a 158.8
dirhams ($43 million) loan from Swiss-based Global  Emerging
Markets  Ltd., the company said.  The debt will be repaid in cash or equity over five years
and the Swiss company will become a strategic investor in Hits
Telecom, the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  Hits Telecom said in November last year that its African
unit raised its stake in  Liberia â€™s Atlantic Wireless, known as
LiberCell, to 55 percent from 30 percent, in a deal valued at
$17 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
