Belarusian Potash Co., the trading
venture of  OAO Uralkali (URKA)  and Belaruskali, plans to increase
potash sales to Myanmar by about 13-fold to 20,000 metric tons
next year as demand for the crop nutrient rises.  Sales this year to the Asian country will be about 1,500
tons, Filipp Gritskov, a spokesman in Minsk for the trader known
as BPC, said by telephone today.  Myanmar’s potash purchases from BPC may rise to as much as
100,000 tons in future, the Minsk-based Belta newswire reported
earlier, citing an official from Awba Group, the trading
venture’s partner in the Asian country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
