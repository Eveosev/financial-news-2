Yahoo! Inc. , the  Internet company 
exploring strategic options, was sued by investors who contend
the board is shirking its duties to seek the best possible price
for the company if it’s sold.  The Sunnyvale, California-based company has instituted
bidding rules that discourage acquisitions that would lead to
replacement of the directors including co-founder Jerry Yang,
M&C Partners III contends in a Dec. 1 lawsuit filed in Delaware
Chancery Court in Wilmington.  Yahoo “has adopted a confidentiality agreement” for
bidders, prohibiting them from talking with other bidders and to
“confine themselves to a bid for only a minority stake,” M&C
lawyers said in court papers.  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  and  Softbank Corp. (9984)  are in
advanced talks with Blackstone Group LP and Bain Capital LLC
about making a bid for all of Yahoo, three people with knowledge
of the matter have told Bloomberg News.  In the lawsuit, M&C claims the so-called no cross-talk
provision “constitutes an unreasonable anti-takeover device”
and “tilts the playing field” in favor of Yang, who wants to
keep “a disproportionate influence” over company affairs.  The lawsuit was assigned to Judge Sam Glascock III, who
will have to decide whether to grant M&C’s request to invalidate
the “minority stake promise” as “unlawful and
unenforceable,” according to court papers.  “We aren’t commenting,” said Dana Lengkeek, a Yahoo
spokeswoman, in an e-mail message.  The case is M&C Partners III v.  Jerry Yang  and  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) ,
CA7082, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
