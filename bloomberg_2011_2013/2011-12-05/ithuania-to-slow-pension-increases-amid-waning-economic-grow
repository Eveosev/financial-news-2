Lithuania will cut back on planned
increases in retirement benefits beginning next year after the
government lowered its economic growth forecasts for 2012.  The Cabinet will raise pensions by half of the initially
planned amount, Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius said at a news
conference today. The 2012 budget draft included plans to
restore pensions to the levels last seen before the global
financial crisis.  The Baltic nation’s government needs to find additional
measures to save about 800 million litai ($311 million) in 2012
budget plan after the  Finance Ministry  cut the growth forecast
to 2.5 percent from a previous estimate of 4.7 percent next
year. Lithuania aims to cut the  budget deficit  to 2.8 percent of
 gross domestic product  from an estimated shortfall of 5.3
percent this year.  The ruling coalition rejected Kubilius’ plan to raise the
value-added  tax rate  by two percentage points to 23 percent to
plug the budget gap. The government will also cut budget
spending by 4 percent to keep the deficit on target, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
