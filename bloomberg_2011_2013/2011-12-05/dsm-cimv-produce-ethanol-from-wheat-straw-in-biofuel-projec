Royal  DSM (DSM)  NV and  France ’s CIMV SA
produced ethanol from wheat straw in a test run of a project led
by French agricultural researcher INRA to develop so-called
second-generation biofuels.  Levallois-Perret, France-based CIMV broke down the straw
into raw materials including cellulose, and DSM used enzymes to
convert the cellulose into glucose that was in turn fermented to
make ethanol, INRA said in a  statement  on its website today.  The companies and INRA are cooperating in the European
Union’s Biocore project to develop industrial-scale processing
of agricultural waste and forestry residues into fuel and
chemicals. Second-generation biofuel is based on non-edible feed
stocks, rather than food crops such as corn.  “Ethanol produced from food commodities, such as sucrose
or grain wheat, is often rejected by public opinion because of
the direct competition that it creates with food,” Michael
O’Donohue, scientific coordinator for Biocore, said in the
statement.  Arkema SA (AKE) , a French chemical maker, will use the second-
generation ethanol to make ethylene, a raw material for
plastics, as part of a pilot project to show how wheat straw can
be converted into PVC, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
