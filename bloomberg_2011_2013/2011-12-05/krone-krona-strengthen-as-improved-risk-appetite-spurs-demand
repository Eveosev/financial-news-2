The Norwegian krone and Swedish krona
climbed against the dollar as speculation that European Union
leaders are making progress on countering the region’s debt
crisis spurred demand for higher-yielding assets.  The krone rose against all but one of 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg, while the krona gained versus 13 of 16 as
investors shunned havens in favor of riskier assets. Equities
advanced and German bunds fell as Italy announced a 30 billion-
euro ($40 billion) austerity plan. German Chancellor  Angela
Merkel  and French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  pushed to rewrite
the EU’s governing treaties as a first step to ending the debt
crisis before a European Union summit in Brussels this week.  “Expectations are obviously building ahead of the EU
summit,” said  Carl Hammer , chief foreign-exchange strategist at
Stockholm-based SEB AG. “Given the market is expecting a pro-
active solution the krona and krone are amongst those currencies
that should benefit.”  The Norwegian krone strengthened 0.8 percent to 5.7459
against the dollar at 4:32 p.m. in London, and gained 0.3
percent to 7.7307 per euro. Sweden’s krona appreciated 0.5
percent against the dollar to 6.7211, and was little changed at
9.0411 per euro.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index added 1 percent, while the
Standard & Poor’s 500 index gained 1.6 percent.  Sarkozy told reporters in Paris today Europe’s two biggest
countries agreed to back automatic penalties for deficit
violators, a European monetary fund and monthly summit meetings.
He said they aimed to reach consensus by March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
