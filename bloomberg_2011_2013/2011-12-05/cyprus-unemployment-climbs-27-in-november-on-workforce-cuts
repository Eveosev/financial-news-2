Cyprus’s unemployment rose 27 percent
in November from a year earlier as the retail and wholesale,
construction, manufacturing, hotel and restaurant industries cut
jobs, the Cyprus Statistical Service said.  Unemployment in the euro area’s third-smallest economy
climbed to 31,826 people and increased 18 percent from October,
the statistical office said in a  statement  on its website today.  Construction and manufacturing in the third quarter dropped
after a July 11 munitions blast at a naval base damaged a
neighbouring power plant, knocking out half of Cyprus’s
generating capacity, the agency said on Nov. 15.  Unemployment in the retail and wholesale trade rose by
1,644 in November from a year earlier and that in construction
by 1,363, the service reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
