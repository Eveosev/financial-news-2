Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) , the maker of
the BlackBerry smartphone, said it fired the two employees who
were taken off an Air Canada flight by police last week because
of drunken behavior and charged with “mischief.”  “RIM expects that its employees conduct themselves in a
manner reflective of our strong principles and standards of
business behavior,” the Waterloo, Ontario-based company said in
an e-mailed statement. “The individuals involved in this
incident are no longer employed by RIM.”  George Campbell, 45, and Paul Wilson, 38, were removed from
the Toronto-to-Beijing flight after the two men’s unruly
behavior prompted the pilot to divert the plane to  Vancouver ,
according to the  Royal Canadian Mounted Police . The men pleaded
guilty to one count of mischief, were given suspended sentences
and probation for one year and ordered to pay C$71,757 ($70,557)
in compensation to Air Canada, the police said.  RIM declined to discuss the case further or say what
positions the fired employees held.  To contact the reporter on this story:
