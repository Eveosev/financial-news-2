Hungary may delay until 2016 a
constitutional rule passed in April that forces the government
to keep cutting public debt, according to a bill proposed by
Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy .  The constitution adopted this year requires the government
to lower debt each year until it reaches 50 percent of gross
domestic product, with the Fiscal Council in charge of
implementation. Hungary was the European Union’s most indebted
eastern member last year, with its public debt at 81 percent of
gross domestic product.  “According to the transitional rule, the debt-reduction
rule would be first applied when making the budget for 2016,”
said the draft, which is dated yesterday and posted on
parliament’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
