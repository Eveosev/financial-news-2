The Obama administration proposed
regulations to combat fraud by health-insurance providers hired
by small businesses to arrange coverage for employees.  The rules, part of the 2010 health-care law signed by
President  Barack Obama , require so-called  multiple employer
welfare arrangements  to meet enhanced reporting requirements
aimed at protecting employers, workers and their families who
need health-care services, according to an e-mailed department
statement today.  The Labor Department’s enforcement authority will be
expanded to protect participants in such plans and let the
department close providers that engage in fraud. The agency has
filed more than 1,100 civil and criminal cases against multiple-
employer plans, recovering more than $226 million through
September, according to an agency statement.  The rules are aimed a multiple-employer operators that have
used loopholes to avoid state regulations, such as a requirement
to maintain sufficient funds and adequate reserves to pay
claims, according to the statement. In some cases, individuals
incur medical bills before being told their claims can’t be paid
-- and they are liable for the costs.  Under the proposed rule, the providers must register with
the Labor Department before operating in a state, or be subject
to penalties. The Labor secretary can take legal action when it
appears that fraud is taking place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
