Austrian Central Bank Governor Ewald Nowotny said he’s “very disappointed” that the country’s debt
brake regulation won’t be in the constitution.  “We are under close international surveillance,” Nowotny
told reporters in Vienna today. “A debt limit in the
constitution is increasingly becoming a necessity, this means we
can’t fulfill an important European challenge.”  Nowotny, who also is a member of the European Central Bank
Governing Council, declined to comment if a lack of a debt limit
in  Austria ’s constitution may hurt its AAA rating.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
