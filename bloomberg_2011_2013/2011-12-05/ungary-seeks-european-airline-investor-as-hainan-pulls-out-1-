Hungary is talking with potential
European investors about Malev Zrt., the unprofitable state-
owned airline, after  China ’s Hainan Airlines withdrew from
negotiations, Development Minister Tamas Fellegi said.  The Cabinet aims to create a “national” airline based in
Budapest, majority-owned by a Hungarian or European Union-based
investor, with less debt than Malev currently, Fellegi told
reporters in Budapest today.  “The focus is not Malev but  air travel ,” he said. “Talks
are at an advanced stage with the possible investors” and may
be completed in the spring of 2012, Fellegi said.  The government won’t sell Malev until the European Union
completes its investigation into state subsidies the airline
received, Fellegi added. Malev may have to pay back “tens of
billions” of forint because of the probe, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
