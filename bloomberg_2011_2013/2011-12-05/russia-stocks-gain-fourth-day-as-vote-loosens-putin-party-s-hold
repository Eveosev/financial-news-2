Russian stocks gained, pushing the
30-stock Micex index higher for a fourth day, after crude oil
advanced and Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s grip weakened in
parliamentary elections.  The Micex Index added 0.8 percent to 1,517.89 at the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow after falling as much as 0.4 percent
earlier. Steelmakers  OAO Severstal  and OAO Novolipetsk Steel
both climbed more than 2.5 percent. The dollar-measured RTS
index rose 0.9 percent to 1,559.28.  Putin’s  United Russia  will get 238 seats out of 450 in the
State Duma, the lower house of parliament, after winning 49.5
percent in yesterday’s election, down from 64 percent in a 2007
vote, the electoral commission said today after 96 percent of
the votes had been counted.  “Policy talk from the country’s leadership will most
likely be tilted towards addressing the needs of the left-of-
centre electorate to move the needle of public opinion for the
presidentials,” Alexey Zabotkin, an analyst at VTB Capital in
Moscow, wrote in an e-mailed note today. “This is likely to be
short-term positive for the consumer.”  Crude futures advanced 1.1 percent to $102.08 a barrel in
 New York  after Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  approved 30
billion euros ($40 billion) of austerity measures yesterday and
on renewed hopes of an easing of  Europe ’s debt crisis. Yields on
10-year Italian bonds dropped 68 basis points, or 0.68
percentage point, to 6.006 percent, heading for the biggest
daily fall since Aug. 8.  Putin’s disapproval rating rose to the highest level since
he became president in 2000 in opinion polls last month,
according to the Levada polling company. Presidential elections
are scheduled for March.  Worst Vote  Yesterday’s parliamentary vote was the worst for United
Russia since 2003, when the party garnered 37.6 percent. Putin,
a former KGB officer, announced in September he would run for a
third term as president, swapping jobs with President  Dmitry Medvedev , who succeeded him in 2008 because of a constitutional
limit on serving more than two consecutive terms.  “A result like this may pressure Putin to accelerate
reform,” Julian Rimmer, a trader of Russian shares at CF Global
Trading in London, said in an e-mail. “This week, however,
market determinants are global.”  The results of yesterday’s elections don’t “change the
investment equation” for Russia,  Ian McCall , a managing partner
at Geneva-based Quesnell Capital SA, which runs the equivalent
of about $116 million in emerging-market assets, said in a phone
interview yesterday.  “United Russia has given us stability for two terms and we
will get a third term of stability,” he said. “The weakening
of their position is also a good sign. It is a sign of
democracy.”  Slight Positive  Confirmation Putin’s party is still in control should be a
“slight positive” for Russian stocks, Mattias Westman,
managing director of Prosperity Capital, which calls itself the
largest Russia-focused equity investor with about $5 billion
under management, said by phone from  London  yesterday.  Westman likes consumer and energy companies such as  OAO
Gazprom , the world’s largest natural gas producer, and  OAO
Magnit , Russia’s largest food retailer. Gazprom gained 0.8
percent to 184.77 rubles, while Magnit rose 1.9 percent, the
most since Nov. 30, to 2,842.8001.  Oil, which along with gas makes up about 17 percent of
Russia’s economy, climbed to a two-week high on Dec. 2. It had
its first weekly gain in three on concern tensions between  Iran 
and the West will threaten shipments from the Organization of
Petroleum Producing Countries’ second-largest producer.  Oil Rises  Oil prices  in New York have jumped 28 percent this quarter,
headed for the best quarter since the three months to June 30,
2009. Urals crude,  Russia ’s chief export blend, jumped 4.1
percent last week to $110.59. Oil producers OAO Rosneft and OAO
Lukoil gained 0.8 percent and 1.3 percent today, respectively.  The Micex has lost 11 percent this year and trades at 5.3
times analysts’ earnings estimates for member companies. The
drop compares with a 16 percent slide for  Brazil ’s Bovespa
index, which has a ratio of 10.4 times, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Shanghai Composite Index trades at
11.1 times and the BSE India Sensitive at 14.5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
