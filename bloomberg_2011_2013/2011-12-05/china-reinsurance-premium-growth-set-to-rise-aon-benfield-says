Reinsurance premiums from Chinese
property and casualty insurers increased to $6.5 billion last
year, a 67 percent rise since 2005, according to  Aon Benfield. (AON)   The pace of growth is set to climb further as the  China 
Insurance Regulatory Commission targets growth in premiums and
plans to create a natural-disaster risk transfer program, Aon
Benfield, the reinsurance unit of the world’s biggest insurance
broker Aon Corp., said in a statement.  China represents about 4 percent of the world’s total
insurance premiums at $226 billion for life and non-life, which
has grown from 1 percent over the last decade, Aon Benfield
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
