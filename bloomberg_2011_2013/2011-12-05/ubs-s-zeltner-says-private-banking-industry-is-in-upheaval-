UBS AG (UBSN) ’s  Juerg Zeltner , head of the
firm’s wealth-management unit, said turbulent financial markets
are creating “upheaval” for the private-banking industry.  “Those who wish to preserve or increase their wealth
cannot count on rising markets,” Zelter, chief executive
officer of the Zurich-based wealth business, wrote today in  Le
Temps  newspaper. Bankers must be “investment advisers,” and
monitor more frequently the health of customer portfolios,
instead of acting as “classic relationship managers,” he said.  “It’s absolutely necessary to have a presence in growth
markets in Asia and emerging markets to enable direct access to
opportunities from investment positions to promising yields,”
Zeltner said.  UBS told investors on Nov. 17 that it plans to increase the
number of client advisers in its wealth unit outside the
Americas to 4,700 from 4,252.  Switzerland ’s biggest bank
adjusted its expectations for earnings and new assets as the
economic slowdown makes wealthy clients more risk averse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
