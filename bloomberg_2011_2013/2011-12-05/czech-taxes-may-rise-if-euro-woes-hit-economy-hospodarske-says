The Czech cabinet may raise some
taxes, including the value-added-tax, if the euro-area debt
crisis prompts an economic slowdown and threatens to boost the
budget deficit,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported.  The government may also shorten the work week as part of
measures aimed at softening the impact of the economic crisis,
the newspaper said, citing a document prepared by the cabinetâ€™s
economic advisory body.  To contact the reporter on this story:
