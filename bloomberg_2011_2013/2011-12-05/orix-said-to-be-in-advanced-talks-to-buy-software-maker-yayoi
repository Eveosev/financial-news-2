Orix Corp. (8591) , a Japanese financial
services provider, is in advanced talks to buy accounting
software maker  Yayoi Co.  from  MBK Partners Ltd.  for about $800
million, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  An agreement could be reached within two weeks, the people
said, asking not to be identified as the information is private.
MBK, a South Korean private equity firm, is still discussing the
sale with other bidders and is seeking as much as $1 billion,
one of the people said.  MBK is exiting an investment it made more than four years
ago as the $3.7 billion private equity manager is considering
raising an Asia fund next year, two people familiar with the
matter said.  MBK bought Tokyo-based Yayoi in 2007 for 71 billion yen
($611 million at the time).  Michael Kim , MBK’s founding partner,
couldn’t be reached for comment. Manabu Ikeda, a spokesman at
Orix, declined to comment. A call to Yayoi outside of regular
business hours went unanswered.  Shares of  Orix  fell 0.8 percent to 6,620 yen at 10:17 a.m.
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Japan ’s benchmark  Topix  index
declined 0.4 percent.  Seoul-based MBK fund focuses on buyout transactions in
 Korea , Japan and the Greater China region. The private-equity
firm acquired Invoice Inc., a Japanese provider of
telecommunications billing services, for $211 million last
December. It also bought Universal Studios Japan in 2009 and
acquired Tasaki & Co., a Japanese jewelry retailer, in 2008,
according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
