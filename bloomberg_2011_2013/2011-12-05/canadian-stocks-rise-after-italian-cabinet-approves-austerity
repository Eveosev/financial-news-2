Canadian stocks  rose for the first
time in three days, led by financial and energy companies, after
 Italy ’s cabinet approved a 30-billion-euro ($40 billion) package
of austerity and growth measures.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) ,  Canada ’s largest lender by assets,
gained 1 percent as Italian bond yields fell to a five-week low.
 Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , the country’s biggest energy company,
increased 1.4 percent as crude futures advanced.  Barrick Gold
Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest gold producer, dropped 1.4 percent as
the metal declined.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index  gained 44.24
points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,119.33.  “Some austerity measures, that’s a good step,” Sadiq S. Adatia, chief investment officer at the asset-management unit of
Sun Life Financial Inc., said in a telephone interview from
Toronto. The unit oversees about C$3.2 billion ($3.2 billion)
for clients. “People are feeling a little more comfortable that
things will get done to get this thing over the hump.”  The index rallied the most since July 2009 last week after
central banks in  Europe ,  Asia  and  North America  cut lenders’
borrowing costs to bolster the financial system. The S&P/TSX has
fluctuated with developments in the European debt crisis this
quarter, which has overshadowed growth in Canadian companies’
earnings.  Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  presented his plan to
raise taxes and cut spending to Parliament today. German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
met in Paris today to discuss the crisis.  S&P Review  Stocks pared their gains after two officials familiar with
the decision said S&P will put all 17 euro nations on review for
downgrades pending the result of a Dec. 9 European Union summit.  The  S&P/TSX Financials Index  advanced after surging 5.2
percent last week. Royal Bank increased 1 percent to C$49.27.
 Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , its largest domestic rival, climbed 1
percent to C$73.48.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , North America’s
fourth-largest insurer, surged 3.8 percent to C$11.63.  Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada’s third-largest lender by
assets, fell 1.3 percent to C$48.37 after Mario Mendonca, an
analyst at Canaccord Financial Corp., cut his rating on the
shares to “hold” from “buy.” Mendonca cited the company’s
lowered earnings-growth forecasts.  Energy stocks  in the S&P/TSX increased as crude oil climbed
for a second day on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. Suncor
advanced 1.4 percent to C$31.20.  Canadian Natural Resources
Ltd. (CNQ) , the country’s second-biggest energy company by market
value, gained 1.5 percent to C$38.33.  ShawCor Ltd. (SCL/A) , which
provides pipeline products and services, rallied 5.3 percent to
C$28.11.  Teck, Ivanhoe Mines  Copper settled at a four-week high on the Comex in New York
after jumping 9.2 percent last week.  Teck Resources Inc., Canada’s largest base-metals and coal
producer, rose 3 percent to C$38.99 for a sixth-straight gain.
Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., Rio Tinto Group’s partner in the Oyu Tolgoi
copper project in Mongolia, surged 5.2 percent to C$21.58 in
Toronto Stock Exchange trading.  Quadra FNX Mining Ltd. (QUX) , which
operates in the U.S., Canada and  Chile , jumped 6.1 percent to
C$11.35.  The  S&P/TSX Gold Index  dropped for a third day on declining
demand for the metal as an alternative asset. Barrick declined
1.4 percent to C$51.15.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-
biggest producer of the metal by market value, lost 0.9 percent
to C$51.84. AuRico Gold Inc., which mines in  Mexico , tumbled 5.8
percent to C$9.18.  Industrial stocks in the S&P/TSX advanced the most among
the 10 groups in the index, led by railroads.  Canadian National
Railway Co. (CNR) , the country’s largest, increased 1.4 percent to
C$79.91.  Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP)  climbed 2.5 percent to
C$63.85.  Gildan Activewear Inc. (GIL) , Canada’s largest apparel maker,
advanced 7.3 percent, the most since December 2009, to C$18.61.
The shares’ 33 percent plunge on Dec. 1 presents a buying
opportunity, Jessy Hayem, an analyst at TD, said in a note to
clients. Gildan sank last week after forecasting a first-quarter
loss.  Imax Corp. (IMAX) , the maker of giant-screen movie-projection
systems, surged 11 percent to C$21.83 after Benjamin Mogil, an
analyst at Stifel Financial Corp., raised his rating on the
shares to “buy” from “hold.” The company is likely to
increase its forecast for 2012 screen installations when it
reports fourth-quarter earnings in February, Mogil said in a
note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
