Egypt ’s benchmark stock index fell
the most in almost two weeks on speculation gains last week were
overdone as the country goes through its worst political crisis
in 30 years.  Commercial International Bank Egypt SAE, the nation’s
biggest publicly traded lender, fell 2.8 percent and Orascom
Construction Industries lost the most in two weeks. The  EGX30
Index (EGX30)  dropped 1.3 percent, the most since Nov. 22, to 4,019.50
at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo. The measure rose 8.1 percent
last week, the biggest gain since March, buoyed by a peaceful
first stage of parliamentary vote. About 42  million shares 
traded, compared with a 12-month daily average of 96 million.  “Investors are taking profit after last week’s spike amid
political uncertainty,” said Omar Darwish, an equity sales
trader at Cairo-based Commercial International Brokerage Co.
“The reap is marked by low volumes.”  Egyptians in Cairo, Alexandria and seven other provinces
started to vote today in run-offs for the first stage of an
election that may give Islamist groups the dominant role in
parliament. The first elections since the ouster of President
 Hosni Mubarak  in February entail two more rounds covering the
country’s remaining 18 governorates.  Commercial International Bank (COMI)  tumbled to 23.3 Egyptian
pounds. Orascom Construction, the nation’s largest publicly
traded builder, declined 2.1 percent to 215.74 pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
