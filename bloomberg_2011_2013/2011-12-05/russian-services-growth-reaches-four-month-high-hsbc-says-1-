Russian services industry growth
accelerated in November to the fastest pace in four months,
showing the economy will end the year on a “optimistic note,”
HSBC Holdings Plc said.  The HSBC Russia Services PMI rose to 54.8 from 53.5 in
October, the U.K. bank said in a  report  today, citing data
compiled by  Markit Economics . A reading above 50 shows growth,
below 50 contraction. The measure reached 56.9 in July.  Combined with manufacturing, which expanded at the fastest
pace since April, overall news business growth hit an eight-
month high, said  Alexander Morozov , chief economist for Russia
and CIS at HSBC, in the statement.  “The slowdown in Russian economic growth signaled by the
PMIs in the third quarter seems to have been reversed in
November,” Morozov said. This indicates that GDP will return to
its average growth rate for the past 12 months of about 0.35
percent per month, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
