Mozambique’s Cahora Bassa North Bank
hydropower project, which will probably add 1,245 megawatts to
the existing facility’s 2,075 megawatts, will be complete by
2013, Noticias reported, citing Gildo Sibumbe, a senior official
at Hidroelectrica de Cahora Bassa.  The electricity will be consumed locally, with surplus
power exported to regional countries, the Maputo-based newspaper
cited Sibumbe as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
