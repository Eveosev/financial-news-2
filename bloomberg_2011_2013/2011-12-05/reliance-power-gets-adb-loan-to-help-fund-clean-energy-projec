Reliance Power Ltd. (RPWR) , controlled by
Indian billionaire Anil Ambani, obtained a loan of as much as
$48 million from the  Asian Development Bank  to help finance a
clean-energy project.  The loan will help fund a 40-megawatt solar power plant in
Rajasthan that the utility will complete by the second quarter
of 2012, the Manila-based lender  said  in a statement today.  Reliance Power will sell the electricity to  Reliance
Infrastructure Ltd. (RELI) , also controlled by the Ambani group, for
distribution to households in Mumbai. That will allow Reliance
Infrastructure to meet mandatory renewable-energy targets set by
the government, ADB said.  India has ordered large industrial companies including
power distributors, steelmakers and miners to source as much as
14 percent of their energy from clean sources. They will undergo
a government audit annually.  Reliance Power received in August an $84.3 million loan for
the Rajasthan project from the U.S. Export-Import Bank to
purchase thin-film panels from  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the worldâ€™s
second-biggest maker of the equipment by sales. The project may
cost about $147 million in total, the ADB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
