Telekom Slovenije Group d.d.,
Slovenia’s state-owned phone company, said it received a lawsuit
from a rival Tusmobil d.o.o. in the capital Ljubljana seeking
damages of 86 million euros ($116 million) for abuse of its
market position.  Tusmobil claims it suffered damages after Telekom
Slovenije’s wireless unit Mobitel d.d., which was merged into
the parent company this year, allegedly abused its dominant
position on the retail and wholesale telecommunication markets
with the offer of one of the price plans, the Ljubljana-based
company said in a statement to the city stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
