Latvia’s government approved next
year’s budget, which envisages trimming the deficit to 2.5
percent of gross domestic product from 4.5 percent in 2011, and
submitted it to parliament.  “For the first time in many years we’re returning to
within the Maastricht Treaty criteria,” Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference today.  Latvia turned to a group led by the European Commission and
the  International Monetary Fund  for a 7.5 billion euro ($10.1
billion) loan in 2008 after its second-biggest bank needed a
rescue and a debt-fuelled real-estate bubble burst. The Baltic
nation plans to conclude that lending program this year and
adopt the euro in 2014.  “We’re very close to closing the international lending
program,” Finance Minister Andris Vilks told a news conference
today. Including next year’s budget measures, Latvia will have
passed spending cuts and tax increases of 2.3 billion lati ($4.4
billion) or 17.8 percent of GDP since 2008, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
