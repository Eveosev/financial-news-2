Taiwan ’s dollar weakened for a second
day and  government bonds  rose before data this week that
economists predict will show export growth slowed last month.  Overseas shipments increased 8.6 percent from a year
earlier, after climbing 11.7 percent in October, according to
the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey before
government data due on Dec. 8. The economy expanded 3.4 percent
in the third quarter, the least in two years, official data show.  “The Taiwan dollar is going to weaken toward the year-
end,” said Teck Kin Suan, a Singapore-based economist at United
Overseas Bank Ltd. “The downside risk is still there for Asian
currencies, including the  Taiwan dollar , that are exposed to
fund outflows and volatilities from  Europe .”  The Taiwan dollar depreciated 0.1 percent to close at
NT$30.182 against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. The yield on the 2 percent bonds due July 2016 fell
one basis point to 0.984 percent, prices from Gretai Securities
Market show.  The island’s consumer prices rose 1.01 percent in November
from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said in Taipei today.
The median of 16 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
1.23 percent gain.  Taiwan will auction NT$100 billion of 364-day certificates
of deposits on Dec. 9, according to a statement on the central
bank website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
