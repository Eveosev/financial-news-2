Manny Ramirez  has asked to be
reinstated by  Major League Baseball  after retiring last year
and has to serve a 50-game drug suspension before he can play
again.  Ramirez, 39, left baseball last season rather than face an
unspecified violation tied to the sport’s anti-doping rules. The
12-time All-Star, who ranks 14th in major-league history with
555 home runs, was suspended 50 games in May 2009 while playing
for the  Los Angeles Dodgers  for breaking the sport’s drug rules.  “As a condition of his reinstatement, Ramirez will be
required to resolve his outstanding violation of the Joint Drug
Prevention and Treatment Program,” MLB said in a statement.  Ramirez’s suspension would begin with the first game he’s
eligible after a team signs him to a contract. The New York
Times reported in April that Ramirez had tested positive for a
performance-enhancing drug during spring training.  In 2009, Ramirez said in a statement that his violation
wasn’t a steroid and declined to challenge the suspension. ESPN
cited two unidentified people as saying Ramirez failed a test
for human chorionic gonadotropin, or HCG, a female fertility
drug that also can be taken by steroid users to help with
testosterone production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
