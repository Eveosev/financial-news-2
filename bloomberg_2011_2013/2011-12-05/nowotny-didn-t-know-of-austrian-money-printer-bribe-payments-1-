Austrian Central Bank Governor Ewald Nowotny says he didn’t know the central bank’s money printing
unit paid bribes.  “I knew nothing about bribes being paid,” Nowotny told
reporters in Vienna today, speaking ahead of a meeting of the
parliamentary finance committee on a criminal investigation at
the central bank’s Oesterreichische Banknoten-und
Sicherheitsdruck GmbH.  The central bank said on Nov. 28 that the Vienna prosecutor
is probing the supervisory board at the unit in connection with
its probe into the alleged payment of bribes. The supervisory
board is headed by Austrian central bank deputy governor
Wolfgang Duchatczek and also includes governor Nowotny and
fellow board member Peter Zoellner, according to the company
register.  The supervisory board, which said at the time that it is
“interested in a complete cleanup of the matter and will fully
cooperate with the investigation,” denied that it had been
informed of the bribes.  Austrian authorities are investigating the former
management of the money printer on suspicion that the company
paid bribes to officials in countries including Syria and
 Azerbaijan  to get new business and that executives received
kickbacks. The ex-managers have denied any wrongdoing.  Nowotny told lawmakers today that the money printer’s
activities in future should be limited to countries in the
European Economic Area, according to a statement from
parliament.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
