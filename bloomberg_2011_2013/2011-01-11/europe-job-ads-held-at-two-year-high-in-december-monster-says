European job advertisements on the
Internet held at the highest in two years in December, said
online-recruiting company  Monster Worldwide Inc .  The Monster Employment Index Europe was at 122 for a third
month, indicating a 22 percent increase from a year earlier, New
York-based Monster said in a report today. Last month’s reading
is the highest since  December 2008 , when the index was at 132.  “This shows that although the employment market is more
positive than last year, a degree of uncertainty remains,”
Andrea Bertone, head of Monster  Europe , said in the statement.
“It seems that many employers are waiting to see a clearer
picture emerge before embarking on wider staff expansion.”  While Europe’s manufacturing industry grew more than
initially estimated in December, its economy relied on exports
as the region’s sovereign-debt crisis prompted countries from
Spain to  Italy  to step up austerity measures, hurting consumer
demand and forcing companies to pare costs.  Italy reported the biggest monthly increase in job ads
among the surveyed countries, while growth in  Germany  slowed.
The transport and production industries led year-on-year growth,
with a 64 percent gain in demand for plant and machine operators
and assemblers, Monster said.  Monster’s employment index is based on job-search websites
from all European Union members, including Monster Worldwide’s
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
