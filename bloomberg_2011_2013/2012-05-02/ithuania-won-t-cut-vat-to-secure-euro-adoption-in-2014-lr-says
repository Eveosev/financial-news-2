Lithuania doesn’t plan to follow
neighboring  Latvia  by cutting the value-added tax to slow
inflation and help euro adoption in 2014,  Lietuvos Rytas 
reported, citing Finance Minister  Ingrida Simonyte .  Lowering VAT would threaten the Baltic nation’s target of
trimming this year’s budget deficit to 3 percent of gross
domestic product, the newspaper cited the finance minister as
saying.  Latvia plans to cut VAT by one percentage point to 21
percent in July to slow inflation as it seeks to adopt the euro
in two years, Finance Minister Andris Vilks said April 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
