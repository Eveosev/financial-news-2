(Corrects company location in second paragraph.)  Next Plc (NXT) , the U.K.’s second-largest
clothing retailer, reiterated profit guidance after first-
quarter sales slowed as wet weather curbed shopping and the
year-earlier period included a boost from the royal wedding.  Retail store revenue fell 3.9 percent in the 13 weeks ended
April 28, the Leicester, England-based retailer said in a
statement today. That compares with the median estimate for a
3.6 percent decline from six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg and
was worse than the 2.7 percent drop reported for Aug. 1 to Dec.
24.  Chief Executive Officer Simon Wolfson said in March there
was “significant downside risk” to U.K.  consumer confidence 
from faltering employment, tight credit availability and the
 European debt crisis . The retailer said product costs, selling
prices and profitability were little changed in the period and
it expects that to continue.  “April has seen particularly unfavorable weather,” and
comparable figures from a year earlier “are extremely
challenging,” Caroline Gulliver, an analyst at Execution Noble,
said in a report before the release. She has a neutral
recommendation on the shares.  A long holiday weekend for last year’s royal wedding and
“exceptionally warm weather” boosted last year’s first-quarter
sales, the retailer said today.  Next fell 1.1 percent to 2,896 pence in  London  trading
yesterday. The stock has gained 5.8 percent this year.  Profit before tax for the year will be between 560 million
pounds and 610 million pounds, the retailer forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
