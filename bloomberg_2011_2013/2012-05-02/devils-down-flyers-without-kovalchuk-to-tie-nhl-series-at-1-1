The  New Jersey Devils  scored all their
goals in the third period to beat the Philadelphia Flyers 4-1
and tie their National Hockey League second-round playoff series
at one game apiece.  Adam Larsson, David Clarkson and Bryce Salvador got their
first goals of the postseason, while Travis Zajac also scored at
Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia for  New Jersey , which lost
the opener of the best-of-seven series 4-3 in overtime.  The Devils were without  Ilya Kovalchuk , their regular-
season top scorer who sat out last nightâ€™s game with what the
team termed a lower body injury. Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur made 19 saves.  Matt Read put the Flyers ahead two minutes, 53 seconds into
the game. The score remained unchanged until 3:08 into the
third, when Larsson tied it.  Clarkson gave the Devils the lead for good eight minutes
later, Zajac doubled the advantage less than three minutes later
with his fifth postseason goal and Salvador made sure of the win
with a shorthanded goal 2:51 from the end.  The teams now head to Prudential Center in Newark, New
Jersey, for Games 3 and 4 on May 3 and 6.  Tonight, the  New York Rangers  resume their series against
the Washington Capitals, which is tied at one game apiece, and
the Los Angeles Kings host the  St. Louis Blues  with a 2-0 lead
in games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
