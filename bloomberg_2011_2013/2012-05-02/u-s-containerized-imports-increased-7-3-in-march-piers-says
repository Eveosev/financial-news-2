U.S. imports of  containerized  goods
rose 7.3 percent in March on shipments of furniture and car
parts, according to PIERS.  Imports gained to 1.4 million 20-foot boxes, the  Newark ,
New Jersey-based tracker of cargo movements said in an e-mailed
report yesterday. The increase raised first-quarter growth to 2
percent, exceeding the expected 1.5 percent climb, PIERS said.  “Although the  U.S. economy  is showing signs of
deceleration, it will likely be momentary,” Mario Moreno, an
economist for the Journal of Commerce/PIERS, said in the report.
“Import growth should regain speed in the second half.”  First-quarter containerized imports from Asia gained 0.5
percent, lower than a forecast of 1 percent, Moreno said.
Shipments from  China  rose 13 percent from a year earlier in
March to 66,681 boxes, according to PIERS. The jump reflected
shutdowns of Chinese factories in January for the Lunar New Year
holiday, which fell in February in 2011, Moreno said.  Auto-part and furniture imports advanced 15 percent for
March, Moreno said in a post on the Journal of Commerce website
on April 26. Shipments from northeastern Asia rose 11 percent as
imports from the  Indian subcontinent  fell 7 percent. Cargoes
from northern Europe advanced 6 percent in March and shipments
from Germany gained 11 percent, the post showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
