Crude oil futures extended declines
after the U.S. Energy Department said stockpiles rose to the
highest level in 21 years.  Supplies increased 2.84 million barrels to 375.9 million,
the department said today. Inventories were forecast to gain 2.5
million barrels, according to the median of 11 analyst estimates
in a Bloomberg survey. Stockpiles at Cushing, Oklahoma, the
delivery point for  New York  futures, gained 1.21 million barrels
to a record 43 million.  Crude oil for June delivery fell 83 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $105.33 a barrel at 10:38 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Oil traded at $105.54 a barrel before release of the
inventory report at 10:30 a.m.  Oil also fell after a report showed U.S. employers added
fewer jobs last month than forecast. Employment increased by
119,000 in April following a revised 201,000 gain the prior
month, according to figures from Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP
Employer Services. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a 170,000 advance.  “The ADP numbers took the wind out of the sails of the
market,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford , Connecticut. “The market needs a
steady drumbeat of positive economic news to move higher.”  Unemployment in countries that share the euro rose to the
highest level in almost 15 years, and manufacturing contracted
for a ninth consecutive month, adding to signs the economy
continues to weaken.  Jobless Rate  The jobless rate in the 17-nation euro area increased to
10.9 percent in March from 10.8 percent in February, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
That’s the highest level since April 1997, when the rate reached
a record at the time of 10.9 percent, according to data
Bloomberg has compiled since 1990.  “Concerns about  Europe  continue to weigh on risk,”
 Michael Hewson , a London-based analyst at CMC Market, which
handles about $240 million a day in U.S. crude contracts, said
today in an e-mailed response to questions. “There’s still a
lot of uncertainty ahead of this weekend’s political events in
France, Greece and Italy. Economic data continue to disappoint
in Europe.”  French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  is trying to retain his
office in a runoff election on May 6 against Socialist
challenger  Francois Hollande . Greece also holds a vote on May 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
