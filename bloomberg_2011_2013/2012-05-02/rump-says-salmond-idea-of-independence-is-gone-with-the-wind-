Donald Trump  said international
investors no longer see Scotland as a secure place to invest
because First Minister Alex Salmond is “single handedly
destroying” Scotland’s economy with his policy of building
thousands of  wind turbines .  A poll in a Sunday newspaper showed that 83 percent of
Scots regarded wind farms as a “blot” on the landscape, Trump
said in a letter to Salmond that was also e-mailed to Bloomberg.  Scotland could never become independent under Salmond’s
leadership because wind turbines would destroy the tourism
industry and the country couldn’t afford the subsidies, said
Trump. The  New York  entrepreneur has put building a hotel and
housing at his golf resort in Aberdeenshire on hold because of
plans to build an offshore wind farm nearby.  To contact the reporter on this story:
