The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default decreased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index slid 3.5 basis points to
153 basis points as of 10:23 a.m. in Sydney, according to
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  The gauge is set for its lowest close
since April 6, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan dropped 2 basis points to 163 from April
30â€™s close as of 8:20 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) 
prices show. The index is headed for its lowest close since
April 17, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market. Hong Kong and Singapore were closed yesterday for a
public holiday.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index fell 2.5 basis points to 181
as of 9:35 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The
gauge is poised for its first decline since April 19, CMA data
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
