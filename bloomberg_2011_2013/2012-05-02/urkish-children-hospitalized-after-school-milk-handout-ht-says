Hundreds of Turkish children were
hospitalized after drinking milk distributed free to schools on
the first day of a government program,  Haberturk newspaper 
reported.  More than 110 children were hospitalized in the eastern
city of Diyarbakir, while 30 children were hospitalized in the
western city of Edirne and more 200 children showed symptoms of
food poisoning in other cities including Adana, Mersin, Sivas
and Antalya, Haberturk said.  Diyarbakir Governor Mustafa Toprak said some children
complained of upset stomachs while others were “affected
psychologically” and taken to hospitals as a precaution,
according to Haberturk. The Health Ministry is investigating the
issue, the newspaper cited Toprak as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
