IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI) , the operator of
websites such as Match.com and Ask.com, rose the most in three
months after traffic to its online-dating and Internet-query
services helped first-quarter profit top analysts’ estimates.  Excluding some items, earnings rose to 51 cents a share,
the New York-based company said today in a statement, beating
the 46-cent average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
climbed 39 percent to $640.6 million, exceeding the $594.1
million projection.  Barry Diller , the billionaire chairman and founder of the
company, is adding digital content and services to IAC, which
operates more than 50 websites. At Match, IAC’s online-dating
unit, revenue increased 56 percent to $174.3 million -- fueled
by a 47 percent jump in paid subscribers and the consolidation
of European site Meetic. In December 2010, IAC named Greg Blatt,
head of the Match business, as chief executive officer.  “What is most impressive about IAC over the past two years
has been the consistent across-the-board strength in
operations,” said Sandy Mehta, CEO at Hong Kong-based Value
Investment Principals Ltd., an advisory firm that holds stock in
the company. “Very few companies in the world have returned so
much capital, free  cash flow , to investors.”  The shares  rose  7.9 percent to $52.58 at 9:58 a.m. in New
York. The shares had advanced 14 percent this year through
yesterday, following a gain of 48 percent in 2011.  Net income jumped 91 percent to $34.5 million, or 38 cents
a share, from $18.1 million, or 19 cents, a year earlier.
Revenue at its search-engine business, which includes Ask.com,
Mindspark and Dictionary.com, rose 47 percent to $343.2 million.  IAC also said it will pay a quarterly dividend of 12 cents
a share on June 1, and the board yesterday authorized the
repurchase of another 10 million shares. The company bought back
5.1 million shares between Jan. 28 and April 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
