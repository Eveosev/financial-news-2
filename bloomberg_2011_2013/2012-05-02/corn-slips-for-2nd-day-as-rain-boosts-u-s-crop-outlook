Corn futures fell for a second day in
 Chicago  as rains boosted soil moisture in the U.S., improving
harvest prospects in the world’s largest grower and exporter of
the grain. Wheat also declined.  July-delivery corn slipped 0.2 percent to $6.26 a bushel on
the Chicago Board of Trade at 2:14 p.m. Paris time. Wheat for
delivery the same month fell 0.6 percent to $6.3725 a bushel.  Wet weather will continue to lift soil moisture in  Illinois 
and other parts of the Midwest, easing dry conditions, Telvent
DTN Inc. wrote in a report yesterday. Illinois is the second-
largest U.S. corn grower, according to the Department of
Agriculture. About 53 percent of the U.S. corn crop was  planted 
as of April 29, compared with an average of 27 percent in the
past five years, the USDA said April 30.  “U.S. markets are under pressure in a context of weather
conditions seen as favorable,” Paris-based adviser Agritel
wrote on its website. “In  France  and Western Europe in general,
the weather conditions are also becoming more favorable.”  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris fell 0.4 percent to 203.75 euros ($267.61) a metric ton.  Winter-wheat yields in  Kansas , the largest U.S. grower of
the variety, are expected to be 45.8 bushels an acre, the
highest since 2003, based on the average estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 10 analysts.  Soybeans for delivery in July declined 0.5 percent to
$14.955 a bushel in Chicago. Futures for the oilseed rose to
$15.07 a bushel on April 30, the highest intraday price for the
most-active contract since July 2008.  “Fundamentals still stack up strongly for oilseeds so we
see sell-offs as buying opportunities,”  Adam Davis , a commodity
trader at Merricks Capital Services Pty, said in an e-mail
today. The USDA forecast last month that global soybean
production will trail demand in 2011-2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
