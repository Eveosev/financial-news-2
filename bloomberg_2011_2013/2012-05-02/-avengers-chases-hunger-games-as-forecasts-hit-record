“Marvel’s The Avengers” will
probably surpass the $152.5 million debut of “The Hunger
Games,” giving the superhero film saga the biggest opening
weekend for 2012.  Estimates for the  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  picture, featuring  Iron
Man , Thor and the Hulk, range from $150 million to a weekend
record of $170 million. “The Avengers” opens in U.S. theaters
on May 4.  The tally for “The Hunger Games” set the mark to beat
for summer films. Exceeding that sum would give Disney bragging
rights that may not be challenged until “The Amazing Spider-
Man” and “The Dark Knight Rises” open in July. Studios try to
manage expectations for their top films to avoid post-weekend
disappointments on newscasts and websites.  “It’s pretty much all about getting a great opening
weekend story,” said Phil Contrino, editor of Boxoffice.com, an
industry website. “That’s 100 percent understandable because
they’re accountable to the stockholders, so they can’t go out
there and be very bullish.”  Industry tracking puts the opening at $150 million-plus,
the  Hollywood Reporter  said on May 1. Analysts are more bullish,
with two including Contrino suggesting the movie may exceed the
all-time weekend mark of $169.2 million set last year by the
final “Harry Potter” film.  “The Avengers” is benefiting from the popularity of
previous movies based on the characters, including Robert Downey Jr.’s two “Iron Man” movies. The film had already generated
$218 million overseas as of yesterday, setting weekend records
in 12 countries including Australia, Brazil and  Mexico ,
according to researcher Box Office Mojo.  Long Tale  “They’ve been building this audience since the first ‘Iron
Man,’” said Contrino, who pegs weekend sales at $170 million.
“Then there’s ‘Iron Man 2,’ ‘Thor,’ ‘The Hulk.’ All of that
built up goodwill.”  In “The Avengers,” Marvel’s superheroes unite to battle
an army led by Loki, the evil god of Norse mythology. In
addition to Downey, the cast includes Scarlett Johansson,  Jeremy Renner  and Samuel L. Jackson.  Weekend sales of $163.9 million are forecast by the
Hollywood Stock Exchange, a website that bases estimates on mock
betting, while  Matthew Harrigan , a Denver-based analyst for
Wunderlich Securities, predicts $170 million.  Paul Roeder, a Disney spokesman, declined to comment on the
forecasts. Shares of Disney, based in  Burbank ,  California ,
gained 1.6 percent to $43.79 yesterday in  New York . The stock
has risen 17 percent this year, ranking seventh in the 16-stock
 Standard & Poor’s Media Index. (S5MEDA)   Social-Media Buzz  Enthusiasm for the film’s prospects is based in part on
Facebook and Twitter activity. As of yesterday, “The Avengers”
had 1.33 million “likes” on its official Facebook page and had
generated 45,936 Twitter tweets. On the Monday before it hit
theaters, “The Hunger Games’ had 2.99 million likes and had
generated 34,476 tweets.  ‘‘That says that the marketing plan is really working,’’
Contrino said. ‘‘People are aware of it.’’  ‘‘The Hunger Games’’ had a similar buildup of expectations,
with forecasts rising as its March 23 opening approached. The
film, based on the Suzanne Collins novel about teens battling in
a televised fight to the death, posted the third-best weekend
debut and has taken in a total of $372.7 million in the U.S. and
 Canada , according to Box Office Mojo.  Advance Sales  At Fandango.com, the ticket-sales website owned by  Comcast
Corp. (CMCSA) , ‘‘The Avengers’’ accounted for about 91 percent of total
purchases yesterday. At the same time in March, ‘‘The Hunger
Games’’ generated 92 percent of sales, according to releases
from the company.  ‘‘The Avengers’’ is among an increasing number of movies
that open first outside the U.S.  ‘‘Battleship,’’ scheduled to open on May 18 in the U.S.,
has generated $170 million in foreign sales for Comcast’s
Universal Pictures since April 11, according to Box Office Mojo.  Viacom Inc. (VIAB) ’s Paramount Pictures, which previously held
theatrical rights to Marvel films before Disney bought the
company, took the same approach to ‘‘Thor” last year.  The film began playing on April 27 last year in foreign
territories and opened in the U.S. and Canada on May 6.  Buzz from a film’s sales abroad can enhance its prospects
in the U.S. and Canada, said  Paul Dergarabedian , president of
the box-office unit of Hollywood.com. He is estimating opening
weekend sales of $150 million.  “It raises the excitement level because it’s being talked
about all over the world,” Dergarabedian said. “That’s why I
think we’ll see more of this international-first strategy on
certain key movies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
