International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) 
agreed to buy Tealeaf Technology Inc., gaining software that
helps marketing executives analyze online buying data and
respond faster to trends.  Closely held Tealeaf, located in  San Francisco , provides
real-time insights about Internet spending on mobile and desktop
devices, IBM said today in a statement. IBM, based in Armonk,
 New York , didn’t disclose terms of the acquisition.  The world’s largest computer-services provider expects
software to deliver half of its earnings in 2015, driven in part
by its Smarter Commerce initiative. IBM has made more than $3
billion in acquisitions, including Unica Corp. and DemandTec
Inc., to add software tools that help businesses uncover trends,
improve online transactions and better deploy their employees.  Tealeaf’s technology spots patterns where online promotions
and transactions work and fail, helping businesses capture
customer data and deliver “optimal experiences,” Rebecca Ward,
its chief executive officer, said in the statement.  Tealeaf was founded in 1999 and  spun off  from  SAP AG (SAP) , the
biggest maker of business management software. It has more than
450 customers worldwide in financial services, travel, retail
and communications services, including Dell Inc., Wells Fargo &
Co., Zappos.com Inc. and Best Buy Co.  Tealeaf is backed by venture-capital firms including
Foundation Capital, Matrix Partners, and Bay Partners.  IBM  rose  less than 1 percent to $208.13 at 1:03 p.m. New
York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
