Two Tunisian policemen were sentenced
to 20 years in prison for killing a man at the start of the
countryâ€™s uprising, the official TAP news agency reported today.  The verdicts were the first against members of the police
force in connection with a civilian death during the mass
uprising that ousted President Zine Abdine Ben Ali from power
last year.  The tribunal also ordered policemen Omrane Abdelali and
Mohamed Said Khlouda to pay 80 thousand dinars ($60,000) to the
family of Slim Hadhri, TAP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
