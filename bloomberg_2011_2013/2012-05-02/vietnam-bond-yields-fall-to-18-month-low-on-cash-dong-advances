Vietnam ’s bonds rose for an 11th day,
pushing benchmark five-year yields to an 18-month low, on
speculation banks will buy debt to improve returns following a
drop in money-market rates. The dong advanced.  “Demand is high since  government bonds  are seen as good
investment now,” said Vu Anh Duc, Hanoi-based senior fixed-
income dealer at  Vietnam Joint-Stock Commercial Bank for
Industry and Trade. (CTG)  “It’s more profitable to hold bonds than to
lend in the  interbank market  now.”  The  overnight interbank deposit rate  was at 4.66 percent
today, after dropping 2.41 percentage points in April in the
third monthly decline, according to data from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate was 11.8 percent at the end of 2011.  The  yield  on five-year notes fell seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 10.58 percent, the lowest level since
November 2010, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled
by Bloomberg. Three-year yields dropped four basis points to
10.54 percent.  The dong advanced 0.1 percent to 20,865 per dollar as of
2:45 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank set the reference rate at 20,828, unchanged since
Dec. 26, its website showed. The currency is allowed to trade as
much as 1 percent on either side of the fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
