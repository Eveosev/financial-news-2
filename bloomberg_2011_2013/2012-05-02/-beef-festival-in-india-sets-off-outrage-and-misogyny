A " beef festival " organized last month by  Dalit  (or low-caste) student groups at Osmania University in the south Indian city of Hyderabad ended up not only provoking the very violence and repression it sought to draw attention to, but uncovered other pathologies deeply embedded in Indian social life. What started out as a debate over the validity of the cow -- to many Indians, the holy cow -- as a source of meat was overwhelmed, on the day, by a conflagration of vehicle-burning and teargas, and, in the days that followed, by a firestorm of upper-caste outrage, conspiracy theory, and, most strangely (but revealingly), by sickening misogyny. As I wrote in an  essay on the subject in January , cow slaughter, and therefore the consumption of beef, is a practice abhorrent to most Hindus. But beef is eaten by India's sizeable Muslim and Christian minorities, and historically by some of the lower-caste groups within Hinduism's  elaborate and often repressive hierarchy of castes , an ancient social order that has only been partially vanquished over six decades by the egalitarian  Indian Constitution of 1950 . Nevertheless, beef-eating in India has become something done in the shadows. There are  laws in many Indian states  restricting or banning cow slaughter; most restaurants and multinational chains (including  McDonalds Corp .) don't serve beef for fear of offending Hindu customers; and mixed-community spaces, such as office canteens or hostel messes, don't serve it either. This "food fascism" was what some student groups of Osmania University sought to challenge in having a festival that served beef on campus to all those who cared to eat it. But this was like waving a red flag in front of the bulls -- the bovine metaphor seems appropriate -- of right-wing student groups dedicated to the cause of "cultural nationalism," such as the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the student wing of the Bhartiya Janata Party,  India 's second-largest political party.  The Hindu reported April 16 : An alternative interpretation of the festival was provided by the Organiser ("the oldest and most authentic weekly of India"), run by the Hindu group  the RSS , which saw the event as a deliberate ploy on the part of Dalits and "Leftists" to inflame the religious sentiments of Hindus. In an article under the headline " Beef Festival Hosted By Left Communalists To Taunt Hindu Sentiments Foiled By ABVP ," N Nagaraja Rao wrote: The implication of the last sentence about adapting to the environment seemed to be that unless "the alliance of beef-eaters" adapted to the wider Hindu environment of beef-eating-as-taboo, Indian civilization would be doomed. Among the participants at the festival who freely accepted Nagaraja Rao's charge that the underlying motive for the festival was "entirely political" was the Dalit poet and feminist Meena Kandasamy, who explained in an essay called " A Cowed-Down Nation ": News of the festival provoked outrage from supporters of Hindu nationalism on social media. But what was most revealing about this strain of reaction was its singling out of Kandasamy for abuse. Although she  explained in a Twitter post  that the "beef fest motive was NOT to hurt. it was to assert the right to eat what students wanted to eat," what she received in return was a heap of  sexually charged invective from upper-caste men . The comments showed how nationalism, racism, egotism and misogyny often exist on the same continuum, and that the same elites that want to control what should be done to the bodies of cows  often also want to control  -- sometimes in the coarsest and ugliest ways -- the bodies of women. One might say that by standing up for the right of Dalits to eat beef in a public space, Kandasamy was acting less as a provocateur (as she was accused by many of being) and more as a scapegoat, a figure on whom a society projects its own sins. What she brought into the open was the  persistence of caste  in India as a source of everyday, even casual, violence, and of gender violence as a widespread response in situations of caste tension. As the  writer Annie Zaidi  wrote in DNA: Meanwhile,  the news channel CNN-IBN reported  last week that men from right-wing Hindu groups had conducted a ritual in Hyderabad "to purify the campus of Osmania University" after its desecration by beef consumption. Some would say, however, that in situations like this, the ideal of purity is much more inimical to peaceful coexistence than the perception, or reality, of pollution.
