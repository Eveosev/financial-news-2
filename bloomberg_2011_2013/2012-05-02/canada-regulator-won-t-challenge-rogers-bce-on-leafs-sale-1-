Canada’s Competition Bureau said it
issued a “no action” letter to  BCE Inc. (BCE)  and  Rogers
Communications Inc. (RCI/B)  regarding their proposed acquisition of
Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd.  Under Canadian law, the bureau can still challenge the
acquisition for one year after it’s completed, and is “actively
reviewing” the transaction, the bureau said in  a statement .  Rogers and BCE said Dec. 9 they agreed to buy a controlling
stake in MLSE in a C$1.32 billion ($1.34 billion) deal to own
the Toronto Maple Leafs of the  National Hockey League  and the
Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
