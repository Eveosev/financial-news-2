A panel of five judges at the  European
Court  of Human Rights will decide on May 9 whether it will
reconsider the case of Muslim cleric Abu Qatada, which the U.K.
wants to deport to  Jordan  to face terrorism charges.  The panel has to make a decision on whether to refer his
appeal to the courtâ€™s Grand Chamber, a spokesman for the
Strasbourg-based body said today. Qatada appealed against a U.K.
ruling that he should be sent to Jordan on the grounds it
infringed his human rights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
