Latvia’s credit rating may be upgraded
by Standard & Poor’s this month,  Telegraf  reported, citing an
interview with Finance Minister Andris Vilks.  Other credit-rating companies may follow suit, giving
Latvia “a few more” upgrades through 2014, Vilks was quoted as
saying. S&P rates Latvia’s debt at BB+, one level below
investment grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
