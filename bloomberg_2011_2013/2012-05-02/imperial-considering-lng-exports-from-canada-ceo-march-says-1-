Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) , the Canadian
company that’s 70 percent-owned by  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , is
considering exporting liquefied natural gas from Canada, said
Chief Executive Officer Bruce March.  “When it comes to LNG, it’s about a lot of gas reserves in
western Canada which makes it strategically possible,” he said
in a briefing with journalists in Calgary. “There appears to be
huge and expansive growth opportunities for gas in Asia.”  Imperial joins  Encana Corp. (ECA)  and other gas producers in
looking for ways to tap Asian demand for the fuel with decades
worth of supply in western Canada. Imperial is looking at
different sites on the Pacific coast of Canada for an export
terminal as part of an LNG export strategy, March said.  The amount the company would need to spend on construction
and operation of an LNG export facility over the 40-year or
longer period is “significant,” he said.  Imperial fell 0.1 percent to C$45.93 in Toronto. The stock
has five buy, nine hold and two sell  ratings  from analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
