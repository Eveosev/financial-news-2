Treasury 30-year  yields  may have
trouble climbing past their 200-day moving average of 3.18
percent, according to Daiwa Asset Management Co., citing trading
patterns.  The rate increased two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, today to 3.16 percent as of 7:15 a.m. in London. The
moving average is seen as a barrier by some traders.  “It’s a  resistance  level,” said Tsutomu Komiya, who helps
oversee the equivalent of $111 billion as an investor in Tokyo
at Daiwa Asset, a unit of Japan’s second-biggest brokerage.  The yield has been less than the 200-day moving average for
almost a month. In  technical analysis , investors and analysts
