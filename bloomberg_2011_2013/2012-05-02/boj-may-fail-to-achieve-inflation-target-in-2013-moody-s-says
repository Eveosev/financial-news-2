 The  Bank of Japan (8301)  is increasing its
purchases of government debt because it probably won’t meet its
inflation goal in 2013, Moody’s Investors Service said.  “It looks like the BOJ’s 1 percent inflation target won’t
be hit,”  Tom Byrne , Moody’s senior vice president in charge of
Asia sovereign credit ratings, said to reporters in Manila today.
“Hence the BOJ is increasing its asset-purchase program.”  The central bank last week increased the size of its asset-
purchase program to 40 trillion yen ($498 billion) and gave an
inflation outlook of 0.7 percent for the year starting in April
2013. The BOJ said April 27 it would reach the “price stability
goal in the medium to long term of 1 percent” soon after the
end of the financial year through March 2014.  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa has been under pressure to
expand easing to defeat deflation. A group of lawmakers this
year proposed overhauling the BOJ’s governing law to ensure
steps to end the price declines afflicting the nation for more
than a decade.  Japan ’s consumer prices excluding fresh food  rose  0.2
percent in March from a year earlier. Inflation is “unlikely to
reach 1 percent any time soon, thus the BOJ’s easy money stance
is likely to remain unchanged,”  Takuji Aida , senior Japan
economist at UBS AG in  Tokyo , said in a research note yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
