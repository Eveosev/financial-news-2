Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD) , the largest
provider of mobile-phone services to South Africans, said basic
earnings per share probably rose as much as 25 percent in the
fiscal year through March.  Profit is estimated to have climbed to as much as 7.01 rand
per share from 5.62 rand a share a year earlier, lower than the
7.24 rand per share median  estimate  of seven analysts polled by
Bloomberg.  The company, based in Johannesburg, said higher taxes and
impairments negatively affected earnings, which are due to be
released on May 21.  Earnings per share after one-time items will probably
increase as much as 10 percent from 6.56 rand last year, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
