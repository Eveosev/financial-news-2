Brazil’s  trade surplus  narrowed to its
smallest in a decade for the month of April as imports jumped to
their highest level on record for that period.  The  trade surplus  fell to $881 million in April, from a
surplus of $2 billion in March and $1.86 billion a year earlier,
the Trade Ministry said in a report published today on its
website. The median estimate of 25 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a surplus of $300 million.  Imports were $18.69 billion in April, the highest for that
month and above the $18.31 billion a year earlier. Exports fell
to $19.57 billion in April from $20.91 billion in March and
$20.17 billion a year earlier.  The real, which reached a 12-year high against the dollar
last year, helped fuel a trade deficit for manufactured goods of
$92.5 billion in 2011.  Brazil ’s central bank has lowered the
benchmark  interest rate  in six straight meetings to 9 percent,
which contributed to a weakening the currency.  Since the end of February, the currency has declined 11
percent against the dollar, the most of 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. The real declined 0.7 percent to 1.9209
per  U.S. dollar  at 4:30 p.m. Brasilia time.  In the first four months of the year, the trade surplus
totaled $3.3 billion.  Economists expect a trade surplus of $19.2 billion in 2012
and of $14.5 billion in 2013, according to an April 27 central
bank survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
