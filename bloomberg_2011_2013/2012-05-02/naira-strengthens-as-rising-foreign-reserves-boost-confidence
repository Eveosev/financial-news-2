Nigeria ’s naira is heading for a week
high against the dollar as the country’s foreign reserves
increase, adding to confidence that the central bank can
maintain currency stability.  The naira strengthened 0.1 percent to 157.32 per dollar as
of 11:29 a.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital. The currency has
advanced 3.2 percent this year versus the dollar.  The foreign currency reserves of Nigeria,  Africa ’s biggest
oil producer, have advanced 11 percent this year to $36.5
billion, according to April 27 central bank data, as the
government partially reduced a fuel subsidy in January and as
the West African nation’s benchmark Bonny Light crude gained 9
percent over the same period.  “The partial removal of the subsidy partly explains the
$4.1 billion increase in foreign reserves year-to-date to $36.5
billion and naira stability, compared with 2011’s depreciation
trend,” Yvonne Mhango, an economist at  Renaissance Capital  in
Johannesburg, wrote in a note to clients today.  Borrowing costs on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due
2021 fell 13 basis points, or 0.13 percent, to 5.398 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on Nigeria’s
naira bonds due in 2015 were unchanged at 15.06 percent,
according to April 30 data on the Financial Markets Dealers
Association’s website.  Ghana ’s cedi rose 0.2 percent to 1.8525 per dollar, in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
