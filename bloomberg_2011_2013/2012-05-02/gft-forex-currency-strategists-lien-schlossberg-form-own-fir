GFT Forex, an online-currency
brokerage that focuses on individual investors, said strategists
Boris Schlossberg and  Kathy Lien  will leave the company in June
to form their own asset-management firm.  The venture, which is going through regulatory approval,
will be called BK Asset Management and will be based in New
York, according to Schlossberg, director of research at GFT
since 2008. The startup should be “up and running” by mid-June
or early July, he said in an interview today.  “For a long time people have asked us to run money and we
have found that to be exceedingly difficult to do working for a
broker-dealer because of regulatory barriers,” Schlossberg, 48,
said. “We’ve decided after doing advisory service for four
years to finally take it to the next level and manage funds.”  Schlossberg and Lien, director of currency research, have
worked together for seven years. They started at FXCM Inc. and
in 2008 together moved to GFT in  New York .  Linda Chamberlain, senior vice president for global
strategy in New York at GFT, confirmed their departure. No
successors have been named to the positions yet.  “This is only the beginning of what we will be doing,”
Lien, 31, said. “We are looking forward to expanding rapidly.”  They will continue to publish currency market analysis and
updates, Lien said.  GFT Forex is based in  Grand Rapids , Michigan, and also has
offices in Singapore,  Tokyo , Sydney and  London .  To contact the reporters on this story:
