EON AG (EOAN) ’s executive board compensation
system works,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  said, citing an
interview with the utility’s supervisory board chairman Werner Wenning.  The executive board was paid less than last year because
the long-term component was cut, the German newspaper said.
Short-term components were calculated without exceptional one-
time effects such as costs tied to Germany’s change in energy
policy, Wenner said, according to FAZ.  To contact the reporter on this story:
