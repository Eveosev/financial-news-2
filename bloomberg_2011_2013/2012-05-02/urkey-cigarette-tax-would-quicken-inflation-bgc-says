A planned Turkish health tax on
cigarettes would have a “very negative” impact on prices,
increasing the inflation rate by 1.2 percentage points this
year, BGC Partners’ chief economist, Ozgur Altug, said in an e-
mailed report today.  The tax would increase tobacco prices in  Turkey  by 24
percent and the likelihood of having double-digit consumer price
inflation again by the end of the year would “increase
significantly,” Altug said.  An additional tax of 1.50 liras ($0.85) per cigarette
package is likely to raise 4.1 billion liras ($2.3 billion) in
revenue for the government,  Sabah newspaper  reported today,
without saying how it got the information.  Turkish prices in March were 10.4 percent higher than a
year earlier. The statistics agency in Ankara will release
figures for April tomorrow. The average forecast of six
economists on Bloomberg is 10.9 percent, estimates ranging from
10.6 percent to 11.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
