China’s stocks  rose the most in two
weeks after manufacturing expanded at a faster pace and the
nation’s two stock exchanges said they will cut trading fees by
25 percent to attract investors.  Citic Securities Co. and Haitong Securities Co. led
brokerages higher on speculation the regulators’ move may boost
 stock trading . Jiangxi Copper Co. and  Yunnan Copper Industry Co. (000878) 
gained more than 6 percent after the  Purchasing Managers ’ Index
rose to 53.3 in April, the fastest pace in a year. SAIC Motor
Corp., the biggest Chinese automaker, climbed the most in a
month after first-quarter net income increased.  “The cut in transaction fees signifies the government is
putting emphasis on the  capital market  and this signal is very
important,” said  Li Jun , a strategist at Central China
Securities Co. in  Shanghai . “The manufacturing data means the
economy in the second quarter may be more stable.”  The Shanghai Composite Index gained 42.12 points, or 1.8
percent, to 2,438.44 at the close. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  advanced
2.2 percent to 2,683.49. China’s markets were shut April 30 and
May 1 for the holidays. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , a
measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies,
advanced 1.1 percent to 104.65 at the close in  New York 
yesterday.  The Shanghai index has climbed 11 percent this year amid
speculation the government will take measures to boost the
economy. Stocks in the gauge are valued at 10.5 times estimated
earnings, compared with a record low of 8.9 times on Jan. 6,
according to weekly  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  About 9.16 billion shares changed hands in the Shanghai
Composite on April 27, or 16 percent higher than the daily
average this year. Thirty-day  volatility  in the gauge was at
16.79, the lowest in two months.  Fees Cut  China’s two stock exchanges will lower fees charged for
trading yuan-denominated shares by 25 percent with effect from
June 1, the nation’s securities regulator said in a  statement  on
its website on April 30.  The Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses will charge both buyers
and sellers 0.087 percent of the transaction value, and the
Shanghai branch of the China Securities Depository & Clearing
Corp. will set transfer fees at 0.375 percent of transaction
value, according to the China Securities Regulatory Commission.  The securities regulator released new rules for initial
public offerings, saying the changes should make the price of
shares “more reasonable” and improve disclosure.  Brokers Rally  Citic gained 1.3 percent to 13.17  yuan . Haitong advanced
2.3 percent to 10.12 yuan. A gauge of financial companies in the
CSI 300 including banks and brokerages advanced 1.9 percent.  “The regulators are trying to revive and excite the
trading in the A-share market, which has been a poor market over
the last few years,” Khiem Do, the Hong Kong-based head of
Asian multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset Management Asia Ltd.,
which overseas about $10 billion, said by telephone. “The
spirit of the change is obviously to get retail investors to go
back into the A-share market and increase trading activity.”  Yunnan Copper led gains for material companies, surging 10
percent to 18.89 yuan. Jiangxi Copper, the biggest producer of
the metal, jumped 6.1 percent to 27.66 yuan. Aluminium Corp. of
 China  Ltd. advanced 2.1 percent to 7.23 yuan.  China’s PMI rose from 53.1 in March, the statistics bureau
and logistics federation said in a statement yesterday. That’s
the fifth straight reading above the 50 level dividing expansion
from contraction. The HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
reported an April final reading of 49.3 for their purchasing
managers’ index today, compared with a preliminary 49.1 reported
April 23 and a final 48.3 in March.  Bear Market End  China’s longest  bear market  since 2005 is ending as
government efforts to bolster the economy spur a rally in
stocks, say the strategists whose buy recommendations two years
ago preceded a 34 percent gain in the  Shanghai Composite Index. (SHCOMP)   While the Communist Party cut its economic expansion target
in March, Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities and Guotai Junan
Securities Co. say  growth  is rebounding from the slowest pace
since 2009 as policy makers ease lending curbs. Value Investment
Principals predicts stocks that benefit most from a buoyant
economy will lead  gains  after they tumbled during the Shanghai
Composite’s 423-day bear market. The retreat ranks as the
second-longest since 1990, according to Birinyi Associates Inc.  “We’re definitely going to have a major  bull market 
ahead,” Jerry Lou, the chief strategy officer at Morgan Stanley
Huaxin in Shanghai, said in an April 24 phone interview.  U.S.-Traded Stocks  SAIC Motor gained 3.7 percent to 15.95 yuan. The automaker
reported a 7 percent gain in first-quarter net income to 5.61
billion yuan. Coal stocks rallied the most on the Shanghai
Composite. China Shenhua Energy Co., the biggest producer,
jumped 2.7 percent to 27.62 yuan after it posted a 5.9 percent
increase in first-quarter profit on higher production and sales.  In the U.S, the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose to the
highest level since 2007, as faster growth in U.S. manufacturing
fueled optimism in the world’s biggest economy. The  Institute
for Supply Management ’s factory index rose to 54.8 in April from
53.4 a month earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-based group’s report
showed.  The  IShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., rose 1.1 percent to $38.35
yesterday, the highest close since March 16.  Solar equipment makers including  Yingli Green Energy
Holding Co. (YGE)  and  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP)  led gains in the
Bloomberg China-US gauge yesterday as Citigroup Inc. said there
are “signs of a near-term bottom” for the shares as demand for
their products picks up.  Of the 16 companies in the Bloomberg China-US index that
have reported earnings since April 10, eight fell short of
analysts’ forecasts, including  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (YZC)  and  China
Telecom Corp. (CHA) , according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  -- Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
