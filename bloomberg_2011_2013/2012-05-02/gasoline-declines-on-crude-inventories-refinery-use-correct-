Gasoline declined to a nine-week low
after the Energy Department said crude-oil inventories advanced
and refinery rates increased.  Futures slipped for a third day as crude stockpiles rose to
a 21-year high and refinery rates jumped 1.3 percentage points
to 86 percent, the highest level since December. Gasoline
stockpiles, which declined for the 11th straight week, are above
the 10-year  seasonal average .  “Gasoline stocks are very ample in the United States and
crude-oil stocks are through the roof right now,” said  James Cordier , portfolio manager at OptionSellers.com in Tampa,
Florida. “Refining capacity looks like we can make all the
gasoline we want.”  Gasoline for June delivery fell 2.14 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to settle at $3.0757 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest settlement since Feb. 29. Gasoline has
declined 9.3 percent in the second quarter, paring the 2012 gain
to 14 percent. Prices traded at $3.0974 before the report’s
release at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Oil supplies  increased 2.84 million barrels to 375.9
million, the report showed.  Stockpiles at Cushing , Oklahoma, the
delivery point for  New York  futures, gained 1.21 million barrels
to a record 43 million.  Demand for gasoline  over the past four
weeks was 4.7 percent below a year earlier.  “Gasoline appears to have topped off for the year
already,” Cordier said. “We could be trading here in the
doldrums for a while.”  He said prices could go lower if the economy sours and
equity markets plunge.  Employment Gains  Employment increased by 119,000 in April after a revised
201,000 gain the prior month, according to figures from
Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Employer Services. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a
170,000 advance.  “You had the bad ADP number this morning,” said  Sander Cohan , a global transportation fuels analyst and principal with
Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,  Massachusetts .  Cohan said  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) ’s agreement to buy a
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  refinery that was to be shuttered is also pushing
down prices.  Delta subsidiary Monroe Energy LLC said April 30 that it
agreed to buy the ConocoPhillips operation in Trainer,
 Pennsylvania . Conoco planned to shut the 185,000-barrel-a-day
plant unless a buyer surfaced by the end of May. Delta plans to
add capacity.  Heating oil and diesel  inventories  dropped 1.9 million
barrels to 124 million, the lowest level since October 2008.
Analysts forecast a 350,000-barrel decrease.  Heating oil for June delivery fell 3.46 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $3.1425 a gallon. The price was $3.167 before the
report was released.  The national unleaded average gasoline price fell to $3.803
a gallon yesterday, according to AAA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
