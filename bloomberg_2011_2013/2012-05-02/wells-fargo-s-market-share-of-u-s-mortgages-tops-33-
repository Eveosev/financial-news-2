Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , already the largest
U.S. home lender, widened its lead in the first quarter by
originating a third of all residential mortgages in the nation
as some of its biggest rivals retreated.  Wells Fargo controlled 33.9 percent of the U.S. mortgage
market in the three months ended March, more than three times
the share for No. 2-ranked  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , according to
Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry publication based in
Bethesda, Maryland. The first quarter’s market share expanded
from 30.1 percent in the fourth quarter, which was already the
highest ever posted by a single company, according to Guy Cecala, publisher of IMF.  “Wells Fargo finished the first quarter with a record
high,” IMF said in an e-mail sent to subscribers. “Perhaps
more significantly, Wells widened the mortgage lending gap among
its competitors.” The tally for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo
exceeded the combined total for the next seven largest lenders,
IMF said.  Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf, 58, is taking
advantage of weakness at competitors such as Bank of America
Corp. to boost mortgage lending, which helped Wells Fargo post
13 straight quarters of profit. Bank of America, once the
largest home lender, has cut back after recording more than
$40 billion of costs tied to faulty home loans and foreclosures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
