Euro-region  unemployment  rose to the
highest in almost 15 years and manufacturing contracted for a
ninth month, adding to signs the economy continues to weaken.  The jobless rate in the 17-nation euro area increased to
10.9 percent in March from 10.8 percent in February, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
That’s the highest since April 1997, when the rate reached a
record high, according to Bloomberg News data going back to
1990. A  manufacturing gauge  in the region fell to 45.9 in April
from 47.7 in March, Markit Economics said.  The  European Central Bank  will probably keep its  benchmark
interest rate  at a record-low 1 percent tomorrow, according to
all 58 economists in a Bloomberg survey. ECB President  Mario Draghi  said on April 25 that European leaders need to create a
“growth compact” as spending cuts across the region damp
activity and prompt a backlash among citizens.  The euro-area jobless rate in March matched the median
forecast of 31 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The number of
people out of work in the region rose by 169,000 from February
to 17.4 million.  In the 27-nation European Union, the  unemployment rate  was
10.2 percent in March, unchanged from the previous month and up
from 9.4 percent in March 2011.  Spain had the region’s highest unemployment rate in March,
at 24.1 percent, with Greece at 21.7 percent, the report showed.
The lowest rates were in  Austria  and the Netherlands, at 4
percent and 5 percent respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
