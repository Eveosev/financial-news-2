Gold declined the most in a week after
three voting members of the  Federal Open Market Committee  said
they don’t see a need for more economic stimulus and as physical
demand slumped in India, the world’s biggest importer.  John Williams , president of the San Francisco Fed, joined
his counterparts from Richmond, Philadelphia and Atlanta in
casting doubt on the need for additional purchases of bonds to
push down longer-term  interest rates  even as American employers
added fewer jobs than forecast. India imported 30 to 35 metric
tons of gold in April, down from 90 tons a year earlier, the
Bombay Bullion Association said today.  “The market is clearly worried,”  Frank McGhee , the head
dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago, said in
a telephone interview. “The physical demand has also been very
weak.”  Gold futures for June delivery fell 0.5 percent to settle
at $1,654 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in  New York , the
biggest drop for a most active contract since April 23. Prices
declined for the past three months, the longest losing streak
since 2001.  Companies in the U.S. added 119,000 workers in April,
according to figures from Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP
Employer Services. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a 170,000 advance.  Holdings in bullion-backed exchange-traded products were
2,381.6 tons as of yesterday, the lowest since Feb. 1, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Significant ETF buying will have to resume in order to
breathe some life back into gold,”  Edel Tully , an analyst at
UBS AG in London, wrote today in a report.  Silver futures for July delivery slid 0.9 percent to
$30.645 an ounce on the Comex, retreating for the third straight
day.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
June delivery slipped 1.7 percent to $669.45 an ounce, the
biggest decline since April 4.  Platinum futures for July
delivery fell 0.5 percent to $1,564.40 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
