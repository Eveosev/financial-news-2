Gome Electrical Appliances Holding
Ltd. (493) , China’s second-biggest electronics retailer, slumped to
its lowest level in almost three years in Hong Kong trading
after forecasting a drop in first-quarter earnings.  The company expects a “significant decline” in first-
quarter  profit  because of lower sales and a loss from its e-
commerce business, it said after trading closed on April 30. The
Hong Kong stock market was closed for a holiday yesterday.  Gome slid 11 percent to HK$1.24  at the close of Hong Kong
trading, its lowest level since June 22, 2009. The stock has
lost 31 percent this year compared with a 16 percent gain for
the benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   The Beijing-based company in March reported a 6 percent
drop in 2011 profit and warned that investments in its e-
commerce business may hurt margins.  Gome competitor Suning Appliance Co. reported a 15 percent
drop in first-quarter net income last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
