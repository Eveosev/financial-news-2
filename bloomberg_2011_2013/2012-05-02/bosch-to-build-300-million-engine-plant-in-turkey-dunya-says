Robert Bosch GmbH , the worldâ€™s largest
auto-parts maker, will build a car engine production plant in
the Turkish capital of Ankara for as much as $300 million,  Dunya 
said, without saying where it got the information.  Bosch held talks with government officials in Ankara in
April after finding land for the plant, the newspaper said.  Bosch, which already has brake production plants in Manisa
and Bursa provinces in Turkey, will make Turkey its engine
production hub for  Europe  including Russia, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
