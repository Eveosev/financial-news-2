Swiss manufacturing output
unexpectedly contracted in April, as the euro crisis took its
toll on order inflows.  The  procure.ch Purchasing Managers’ Index  fell to 46.9 in
April from 51.1 in March, when adjusted for seasonal swings,
Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich said in an e-mailed statement
today. That’s the lowest level since November. A reading below
50 indicates contraction. Economists had  forecast  a value of 51,
the median of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg survey showed.  “The course of the index clearly shows the back and forth
of the euro crisis,” Credit Suisse said. “Disappointment is
taking hold again.”  The output sub-indicator fell 6.4 points to 46.2, while the
gauge measuring backlogs of orders dropped 7.4 points to 47.8
and the indicator of suppliers’ delivery times advanced 2.4
points to 50.8. Both the sub-indicators for employment and
stocks of purchases fell from March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
