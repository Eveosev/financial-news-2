CME Group Inc. (CME)  Chief Executive Officer
 Craig Donohue  retired effective yesterday, leaving the world’s
largest futures market ahead of schedule, the company said today
in a regulatory filing.  Donohue, 50, said last week on a conference call with
analysts that the transition to promote President Phupinder Gill
to the CEO role was going faster than planned, with a formal
hand-off possible by the May 23 annual shareholder meeting.  Donohue, who has run the Chicago-based company for the past
eight years, announced last month his plan to retire in December
when his contract expires.  “The transition has gone very well and everyone is ready
to move on and into their new roles so we have been able to
expedite the official date,” Anita Liskey, a CME spokeswoman,
said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
