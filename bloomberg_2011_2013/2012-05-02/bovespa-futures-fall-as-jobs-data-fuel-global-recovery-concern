The Bovespa index rose for a second
day as data that showed manufacturing picked up in China boosted
the outlook for growth in  Brazil ’s top trading partner,
outweighing employment in  Europe  and the U.S.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA contributed the most to the gauge’s
advance after  Valor Economico  reported that the state-run oil
producer may participate in a 5 billion-real ($2.6 billion)
project to build a terminal in the city of Marica in the state
of  Rio de Janeiro .  OGX Petroleo (OGXP3)  & Gas Participacoes SA rose
after its controller, the billionaire  Eike Batista , said he’s
considering the sale of another stake in his EBX Group Co.  The Bovespa climbed 0.5 percent to 62,111.11 at 2:07 p.m.
in Sao Paulo. Forty stocks gained while 27 fell. The real
weakened 0.8 percent to 1.9241 per  U.S. dollar .  China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 53.3 in April
from 53.1 in March, the statistics bureau and logistics
federation said yesterday. It was the fifth straight reading
above the 50 level dividing expansion from contraction.  “Markets in Brazil were closed yesterday for a national
holiday, so only today investors are analyzing data that show
manufacturing in  China  rose in April,” Joao Pedro Brugger, who
helps oversee 70 million reais ($37 million) at Leme
Investimentos, said by phone from Rio de Janeiro. “It’s more
important for Brazil that China recovers than the euro region or
even the U.S.”  Employment Reports  The jobless rate in the 17-nation euro area increased to
10.9 percent in March from 10.8 percent in February, the
European Union statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
That’s the highest since April 1997, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. U.S. employers added 119,000 workers in April,
according to figures from Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP
Employer Services. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a 170,000 advance.  Petrobras advanced 2.7 percent to 21.87 reais. OGX gained
3.7 percent to 13.72 reais.  Batista said he’s considering partnering with an industrial
group to help develop iron-ore, oil, coal and gold resources
that he estimates may be worth about $1.5 trillion. The sale of
another stake in EBX would help boost global investors’
confidence in these projects, the billionaire said April 30 in 
an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Money Moves.”  Banks Fall  Banco do Brasil SA , Latin America’s biggest bank by assets,
dropped 1.2 percent to 23.29 reais, the most in a week. It was
the worst performer on the MSCI Brazil/Financials Index, which
slipped 0.9 percent.  Itau Unibanco SA (ITUB)  lost 0.7 percent to 29.79
reais.  President  Dilma Rousseff  said in a televised address on
April 30 that the economy will only be competitive when  interest
rates  for producers and consumers are at global-market levels.  Brazil’s benchmark equity  measure  has gained 9.5 percent
this year, buoyed by local interest-rate cuts, signs of
expansion in the U.S. and speculation Europe may be closer to
resolving its sovereign-debt crisis. The gauge has fallen 9
percent since this year’s high on March 13 as signs of a
slowdown in China spurred speculation that demand for
commodities exports may falter.  The Bovespa trades at 10.4 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, in line with the 10.6 ratio for MSCI Inc.’s measure
of 21 developing nations’ equities, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Trading  volume  was 4.86 billion reais in stocks in  Sao
Paulo  on April 30, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
compares with a daily average of 7.23 billion reais this year
through April 27, according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
