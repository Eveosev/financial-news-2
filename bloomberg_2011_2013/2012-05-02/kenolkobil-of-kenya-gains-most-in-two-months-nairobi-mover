KenolKobil Ltd. (KNOC) , a Kenyan fuel
retailer with operations in nine African countries, gained the
most in more than two months after the  Times of Zambia  reported
it was shortlisted for a tender by the Zambian government.  The stock climbed 3.8 percent to 12.50 shillings by 3 p.m.
in the capital, Nairobi, the largest increase since Feb. 16,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  KenolKobil is one of six companies shortlisted by  Zambia ’s
ministry of Energy, Mines, and Water Development to supply
petroleum products and crude oil, the newspaper reported
yesterday. In February the government invited tenders for the
supply of 1.4 million tons of oil after the expiry of a contract
with Glencore under a two-year arrangement from March 2010, the
newspaper said.  Patrick Kondo, the company’s mergers and acquisitions
manager wasn’t immediately available to comment.  “It is one of the indigenous businesses with the largest
exposure in sub Saharan Africa,” Eric Musau, a research analyst
at Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  KenolKobil increased its stake in Zambia’s Lublend Ltd. to
25.5 percent after it bought an additional 10.5 percent stake
from  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , having earlier acquired 15 percent of
Lublend from  Total Zambia Ltd. (FP) , it said in January 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
