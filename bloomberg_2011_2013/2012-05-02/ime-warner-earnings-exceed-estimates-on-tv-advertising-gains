Time Warner Inc. (TWX) , the owner of movie,
television and publishing businesses, reported first-quarter
earnings that beat analysts’ estimates on TV-advertising gains.  Earnings excluding some items rose to 67 cents a share, the
New York-based media and entertainment company said today in a
statement. Analysts predicted 64 cents, the average of  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales also exceeded projections.  Time Warner, led by Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Bewkes,
derives more than 70 percent of its annual operating income from
its television business, which produces shows such as the hit
series “The Big Bang Theory.” Advertising at television
networks increased 6 percent, and subscription fees to carry the
company’s cable networks rose 5 percent.  “Cable-network advertising revenue is what matters most,
and that 6 percent growth was ahead of our estimates,”  Michael Morris , a Davenport & Co. analyst in Richmond,  Virginia , said in
an interview. He rates Time Warner shares neutral.  The cancellation of HBO’s high-profile gambling series
“Luck,” set in the world of horseracing,  cost  $35 million in
impairment expenses, according to Time Warner.  Sales advanced 4.4 percent to $6.98 billion from $6.68
billion a year ago. Analysts estimated $6.82 billion on average.  The company’s filmed-entertainment revenue increased 6.9
percent to $2.78 billion, helped by ticket sales for its
February film “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.” The
company’s  Warner Bros . film division faces tougher comparisons
this year after the final film from the Harry Potter franchise
boosted 2011 results.  Time Warner fell 1.7 percent to $37.29 in  New York  at the
close. The stock has risen 3.2 percent this year.  Time Warner’s publishing business, which includes People,
 Sports Illustrated  and Time magazines, declined 3.1 percent.  Net income dropped 11 percent to $583 million, or 59 cents
a share, from $653 million, or 59 cents, year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
