Enel Green Power SpA (EGPW) , the renewables
unit of Italy’s biggest utility, signed a 180 million-euro ($237
million) financing agreement with Denmark’s export credit agency
and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  to fund wind projects abroad.  The 12-year loan will help fund the 120-megawatt Zephyr I
wind farm in Romania, the 200-megawatt Caney River project in
Kansas and the 90-megawatt Cristal venture in Brazil, Enel Green
Power said today in a  statement . The interest rate is “in
line” with the market benchmark, it said, without elaborating.  Enel Green Power is expanding into new markets to counter
lower demand in  Europe , where the sovereign-debt crisis has cut
electricity use. The company has earmarked global spending of
6.1 billion euros through 2016 to add 4.5 gigawatts of installed
capacity, including about 460 megawatts of wind projects in
 Brazil , 340 megawatts in Chile and 350 megawatts in Mexico. It’s
targeting about 500 megawatts of wind power in Romania.  Denmark’s export credit agency helps support Danish
businesses by funding companies that use their products.
Citigroup arranged the loan for the three wind parks, which will
cost a combined 670 million euros to build, according to Rome-
based Enel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
