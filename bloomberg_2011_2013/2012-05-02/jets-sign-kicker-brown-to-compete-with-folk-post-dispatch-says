The  New York Jets  signed former St.
Louis Rams kicker Josh Brown to compete with  Nick Folk  for the
starting job, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Brown, 33, spent the past four National Football League
seasons in St. Louis and was released after the franchise
selected kicker Greg Zuerlein from Missouri Western State in the
sixth round of the draft.  Brown made 21 of 28 field goals for the Rams last season
and has connected on  220 of 272 kicks  over his nine-year NFL
career, a success rate of 81 percent.  Folk, 27, made 19 of 25 field goals for the Jets last
season and has a  77.9 percent  success rate for his career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
