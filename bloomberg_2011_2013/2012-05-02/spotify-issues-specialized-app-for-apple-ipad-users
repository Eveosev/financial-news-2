Spotify Ltd., the music streaming
 service , released a specialized application for  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s
iPad that allows subscribers to search for songs, playlists and
connect with other users.  The software, available on Apple’s  App Store , displays
cover art in high-definition and provides gapless playback and
crossfade for uninterrupted listening, London-based Spotify said
in an e-mailed  statement .  Spotify is seeking to sign up more premium subscribers
where access is available on mobile devices for $9.99 a month.
Before now, iPad owners were limited to using Spotify’s program
for the iPhone, which is built for a smaller screen. The new app
allows users with  Apple TV  devices to stream music from an iPad
to their home stereo using Apple’s AirPlay technology.  The iPad app’s features also include highlighting music
that’s being played the most across the service’s 17 million-
song library and the most popular playlists among a user’s group
of friends. Spotify is offering non-subscribers a free 30-day
trial to use the iPad app.  The online music provider  has  more than 10 million active
customers who use its free ad-supported service and 3 million
subscribers who pay for either the $4.99 monthly service limited
to desktop computers, or pay for its premium mobile service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
