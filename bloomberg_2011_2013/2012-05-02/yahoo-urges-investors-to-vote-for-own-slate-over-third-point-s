Yahoo! Inc., owner of the largest U.S.
Web portal, urged its shareholders to support its board
candidates, rather than nominees put forward by shareholder
 Third Point  LLC.  “Regrettably, our efforts to avoid a proxy contest with
Third Point were unsuccessful,” Yahoo said in a letter to
investors today. Third Point Chief Executive Officer Daniel Loeb
insisted that there could be no settlement unless he was
personally appointed to the board, Yahoo said.  Yahoo has come under investor scrutiny after losing ground
to rivals  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Facebook Inc. (FB)  and posting three years
of declining sales. New CEO Scott Thompson, who joined in
January after his predecessor Carol Bartz was ousted, is trying
to drive a turnaround by focusing on growth and shrinking costs.  The Sunnyvale, California-based company’s committee for
nominating board members identified more than 100 potential
candidates, according to the letter, and engaged with 20 of
them, including the nominees from Third Point. The candidates
picked at the end of the process are “significantly superior”
to those proposed by Third Point, Yahoo said.  Yahoo shares rose less than 1 percent to $15.67 at the
close in  New York . The stock has fallen 2.9 percent this year.
Third Point held 5.8 percent of the stock as of March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
