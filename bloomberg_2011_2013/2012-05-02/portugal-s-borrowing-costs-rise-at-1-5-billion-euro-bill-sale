Portugal sold 1.5 billion euros ($2
billion) of bills in an auction today, the maximum amount for
sale, with investors demanding higher  interest rates  to purchase
the debt.  The 12-month securities due in May 2013 were issued at an
average yield of 3.908 percent, the country’s debt management
agency said. That compares with an average yield of 3.652
percent at a previous auction of 12-month bills on March 21. The
auction attracted bids for 2.7 times the amount offered,
compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.5 in March.  The debt agency also sold 500 million euros of six-month
bills due in November 2012 at an average yield of 2.935 percent,
attracting bids for 4.1 times the amount offered. That compares
with an average yield of 2.9 percent at a previous auction of
six-month bills on April 4, with a bid-to-cover ratio of 5.  The IGCP, as the debt agency is known, on April 26 said
that the total indicative amount for today’s auctions was
between 1.25 billion euros and 1.5 billion euros.  The sale “took place without surprises” and “interest is
still there,” said Filipe Silva, who manages 60 million euros
of securities at Banco Carregosa SA in Oporto, northern
 Portugal . The next test will be to sell debt maturing after
September 2013, he said.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said March 5 that if the
country can’t tap bond markets by September 2013 as planned, due
to “external reasons,” it would be able to count on continued
support from the  International Monetary Fund  and the European
Union. Portugal is cutting spending and increasing taxes to
comply with the terms of a 78 billion-euro aid plan requested
last year from the IMF and the EU.  ECB Loans  Portugal’s two-year note yield fell 31 basis points from
April 30 to 8.27 percent as of 11:05 a.m. in  London .  The  European Central Bank  in February approved the
temporary use of additional collateral in funding operations by
seven euro-area members’ central banks including Portugal. It
offered loans of up to three years against eligible collateral
on Feb. 28 that can be used to finance purchases of assets
including higher-yielding  government debt .  Portugal’s IGCP on March 29 said it plans to sell as much
as 4.5 billion euros of bills in the second quarter. It sold 1.5
billion euros of six- and 18-month bills on April 4.  To contact the reporters on this story:
