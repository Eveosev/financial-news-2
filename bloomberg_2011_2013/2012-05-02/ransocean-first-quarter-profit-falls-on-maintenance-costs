Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the world’s largest
offshore-rig contractor, reported first-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates as maintenance costs rose less than
expected.  Net income fell to $42 million, or 12 cents a share, from
$310 million, or 96 cents, a year earlier, the Vernier,
Switzerland-based company said in a statement today.  Excluding $184 million in charges mostly related to a
goodwill expense, the company earned 64 cents a share, 32 cents
more than the average of 31 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales climbed 8.7 percent to $2.3 billion.  “The beat was really driven more by controlling their
operating and maintenance costs this quarter a little better,”
Brian Youngberg, an analyst at  Edward Jones  in  St. Louis , who
rates the shares a hold and owns none, said today in a telephone
interview. “That was a big issue for them in the second half of
last year. Getting that fixed is definitely a step in the right
direction.”  Total operating and maintenance costs increased 3.8 percent
to $1.4 billion. Youngberg said he was expecting the costs to be
in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion.  The number of rigs  operating  in the U.S.  Gulf of Mexico 
climbed 62 percent to an average of 42 during the first quarter
from 26 a year earlier, according to  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   Producers and explorers chasing oil at more than $100 per
barrel have been pushing up rig demand.  Rates Seen Rising  Rental rates for the industry’s ultra-deepwater rigs, the
world’s most complex and expensive drilling vessels, should
climb 28 percent to a record $714,000 a day by the third quarter
from about $560,000 currently, according to estimates by Ole Slorer, an analyst at Morgan Stanley who dubs the move a “super
spike.”  The company’s total out-of-service costs are expected to
drop $500 million this year compared to 2011, Chief Financial
Officer Greg Cauthen said on a Feb. 27 conference call.  Transocean owned the $365 million Deepwater Horizon rig
that was destroyed in the  BP Plc (BP/)  oil spill in the Gulf of
 Mexico . The company employed nine of the 11 workers who died in
the April 2010 disaster.  The earnings results were released after the close of
regular trading on U.S. markets. Transocean fell 1.6 percent to
$49.93 at the close in  New York .  (Transocean scheduled a conference call to discuss first-
quarter results for 10 a.m. New York time tomorrow. To access
