Ethanol futures fell the most in two
weeks after a government report showed an inventory gain.  Futures declined a day after the Energy Department said
stockpiles jumped 1.7 percent to 22.2 million barrels in the
week ended April 27, a four-week high and the biggest weekly
advance since March 16.  “That was a little negative,” said Jerrod Kitt, an
analyst at Linn Group in  Chicago . “You got another inventory
build.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery slipped 3.6 cents, or
1.6 percent, to settle at $2.175 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the biggest decline since April 18. Prices are down
1.3 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol sank 2.5 cents to $2.235 a
gallon in the U.S. Gulf and 2 cents to $2.25 in  New York , data
compiled by Bloomberg showed. Ethanol fell 1.5 cents to $2.185
in Chicago and 2 cents to $2.315 on the West Coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
