Royal Boskalis Westminster NV won a 70
million-euro ($92 million) contract to install turbine
foundations at a U.K. wind farm being developed by  Iberdrola
SA (IBE) ’s ScottishPower Renewables unit and Dong Energy A/S.  Boskalis will build foundations for 108 turbines at the
Irish Sea wind park called West of Duddon Sands, the Dutch
marine-services company said today in a  statement . The work will
start in early 2013 and be completed by mid-2014, it said.  The 1.6 billion-pound ($2.6 billion) wind farm is about 14
kilometers (9 miles) off Barrow-in-Furness in northern  England .
Dong, a utility based in Skaerbaek,  Denmark , and ScottishPower
Renewables are building the 389-megawatt project, which they
expect to produce enough power for about 300,000 homes.  Boskalis will collaborate with Volker Construction
International, a unit of Dutch Volkerwessels Bouw &
Vastgoedontwikkeling Midden BV, on the contract, it said.  Iberdrola may invest 12 billion pounds in Britain this
decade, including on wind projects, the Spanish company said in
February. The West of Duddon Sands venture marks the start of
its offshore wind investment program, it said today in a
separate statement, detailing contracts valued at a combined 115
million euros for work at the project.  Boskalis also won a contract for seabed work at WindMW
GmbH’s Meerwind project in the German  North Sea , and an order to
inspect and repair about 20 offshore oil production platforms
for Maersk Oil in the Danish North Sea, it said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
