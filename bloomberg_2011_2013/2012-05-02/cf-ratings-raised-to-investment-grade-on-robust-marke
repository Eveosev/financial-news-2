  CF Industries Holdings Ltd. (CF) ’s  credit
ratings were raised to investment grade as the largest U.S.
maker of nitrogen fertilizers benefits from higher prices for
crop nutrients. Its share price rose to a record.  Moody’s Investors Service changed the ratings to Baa3 from
Ba1 with a “positive” outlook, according to a statement today.
The improvement was based on the Deerfield, Illinois-based
company’s cash flow and low debt levels as the price of natural
gas, a key component of making the fertilizer, drops.  “An upgrade is likely over the next four quarters if
management continues to build a track record of prudent
management and the fertilizer industry conditions remain
robust,” William Reed and  Steven Wood  of Moody’s wrote in the
report.  CF is benefiting from higher prices for nitrogen crop
nutrients, including  urea , as U.S. farmers put this year’s corn
crop in the ground. The company, which acquired nitrogen-
industry competitor Terra Industries Inc. in 2010, is scheduled
to report first-quarter earnings tomorrow.  The company’s $800 million of 7.125 percent notes due May
2020 rose 3.75 cents to 123.5 cents on the dollar as of 1:48
p.m. in  New York , according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  CF  rose  2.5 percent to $200.13 at the close in New York,
the highest since the company began trading in 2005. The shares
have gained 38 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
