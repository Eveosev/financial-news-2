DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. (DWA) , maker
of the “Kung Fu Panda” films, said first-quarter profit rose
3.2 percent on overseas ticket sales and home-video revenue from
the film “Puss in Boots.”  Net income increased to $9.1 million, or 11 cents a share,
from $8.8 million, or 10 cents, a year earlier, the Glendale,
California-based company said today in a  statement . Analysts
predicted 9 cents, the average of 12 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 26 percent to $136.1 million, beating
projections of $133.3 million.  “Puss in Boots” had worldwide ticket sales of $554
million and contributed $73.6 million in revenue for the
quarter, the company said. The filmmaker produces two to three
movies a year. The first of two theatrical releases for 2012,
“Madagascar 3:  Europe ’s Most Wanted,” opens on June 8. “Rise
of the Guardians” comes out Nov. 21. DreamWorks Animation has
three movies slated in 2013.  DreamWorks Animation rose 2 percent to $18.46 at the close
in New York. The stock has  gained  11 percent this year.  An agreement for  Viacom Inc. (VIAB) ’s Paramount Pictures to
distribute its films worldwide expires this year.  Creating an internal distribution system is among the
options DreamWorks Animation is considering, Chief Executive
Officer  Jeffrey Katzenberg  said today on a conference call. The
company won’t begin serious discussions about the alternatives
until after “Madagascar 3” is released, he said.  In addition to theatrical revenue, DreamWorks Animation
collects sales from DVDs and pay television.  In September, DreamWorks Animation signed a home-video
accord with  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  that starts next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
