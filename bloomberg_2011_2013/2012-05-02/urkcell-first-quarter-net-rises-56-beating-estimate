Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL) ,
Turkey’s biggest mobile phone operator, said first-quarter
profit rose 56 percent, helped by mobile Internet revenue
growth.  Net income rose to 514.8 million liras ($292 million) from
330.1 million liras a year earlier, the company said in a
statement today. The year-earlier period included a charge
related to its Ukraine unit. Turkcell was estimated to report
net income of 408.4 million liras, according to the average of
14 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Turkcell, partially owned by  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) , is facing more
competition at home from  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and Avea Iletisim
Hizmetleri AS, majority-owned by  Turk Telekomunikasyon AS. (TTKOM)  The
country’s fixed and mobile telephone market grew 7.5 percent to
22.8 billion liras in 2011, according to the market regulator.
Turkcell controlled 53 percent of the mobile market at the end
of 2011, while Vodafone had 28 percent and Avea had 20 percent,
according to Turkcell’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
