Wisconsin ’s Republican Governor  Scott Walker  and Democratic Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett are deadlocked
in a poll released today on a hypothetical match-up in a June 5
recall election.  The survey from Marquette Law School has Barrett leading
former Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk almost 2-to-1 going
into the May 8 Democratic primary that will determine which will
face Walker. If the numbers bear out, the governor and mayor
would face each other for the second time in 19 months in the
nation’s third gubernatorial recall.  Barrett led Falk 38 percent to 21 percent in the poll of
705 registered voters conducted April 26-29. Secretary of State
Doug La Follette and state Senator Kathleen Vinehout trailed
with 8 percent and 6 percent, respectively, while 19 percent
said they were undecided.  “Despite Barrett’s late entry into the race, he has
improved his position both among Democratic primary voters and
in the general recall contest against Walker,”  Charles Franklin , director of the poll, said in a statement.  Barrett led Walker 47 percent to 46 percent among
registered voters. Among likely voters the measurement has the
governor up 48 percent to 47 percent.  The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 3.8 percentage
points.  Walker’s opponents forced the recall after he championed
restrictions on unions that represent must public employees,
saying local governments needed financial help. Democrats said
he was trying to break labor’s power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
