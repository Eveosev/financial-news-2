French nitrogen-fertilizer shipments
fell 17 percent from July through February to the lowest level
in at least four years, industry association Unifa said.  Nitrogen sales in  France  declined to 1.33 million metric
tons in the first eight months of the year that started July 1
from 1.61 million tons a year earlier, Paris-based Unifa wrote
in an e-mailed statement today.  France is the largest crop grower in the European Union,
and the blocâ€™s biggest user of crop nutrients, according to the
International Fertilizer Industry Association. Nitrogen is
applied to plants to boost yields.  Potassium-fertilizer shipments in France fell 16 percent to
391,000 tons in May through February, while phosphate deliveries
declined 20 percent to 328,000 tons, Unifa said.  The association tracks nitrogen sales on the basis of a
year that starts July 1, while the marketing year for potassium
and phosphorus begins May 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
