GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , the U.K.’s
largest drugmaker, sold $5 billion of bonds in its first dollar-
denominated offering in four years as companies market the most
 U.S. debt  in more than a month.  Glaxo issued $1 billion of three-year notes and $2 billion
each of five- and 10-year bonds, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The deal is its first dollar sale since 2008, when
the London-based company raised $9 billion in what was then the
largest U.S. corporate bond offering in six years.  The company is leading borrowers including Hong Kong-based
 Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13)  and Ericsson AB, the biggest maker of
wireless  network equipment , that are selling at least $14.6
billion in U.S. debt, the  most since  March 14, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Foreign issuers including  Barclays Plc (BARC) 
and  BP Plc (BP/)  are raising money in the U.S. bond market after
yields on investment-grade debt fell to the lowest level ever
last week.  “Almost half of corporate issuance is being seen from non-
U.S. issuers,” Jennifer Powers, head of investment-grade
 capital markets  for the Americas at Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc, said today in New York. “Issuers are finding that the U.S.
market is attractive or their home market is not open to them.”  Barclays Debt  Barclays, the U.K.’s second-largest lender by assets, sold
$2 billion of 2.25 percent five-year debt to yield 153 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data
show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Hutchison Whampoa, the telecommunications company whose
chairman is billionaire  Li Ka-shing , sold $1 billion of dollar-
denominated perpetual bonds, its first offering since January.
The notes carry a variable coupon, starting at 6 percent for the
first five years, and were issued at a yield of 517.6 basis
points more than similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries.  Ericsson, which last offered dollar-denominated debt more
than a decade ago, sold $1 billion of 4.125 percent notes due
May 2022 that yield 225 basis points more than Treasuries. It
will use proceeds to refinance debt maturing through 2014 and
for general corporate purposes, the Stockholm-based firm said in
a regulatory filing.  Glaxo, which has about $23 billion of bonds  outstanding ,
sold its three-year debt to yield 45 basis points more than
Treasuries, the five-year portion at 75 basis points more than
benchmarks, and the 10-year debt at a 100 basis-point spread.
Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes such as
refinancing existing bonds, Glaxo said today in a filing.  Yields on investment-grade U.S. bonds fell to a record 3.37
percent on April 27, down from 3.895 percent at the end of last
year, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. The debt
has returned 3.59 percent this year, compared with 0.01 percent
for Treasuries, the data show.  BP,  Europe ’s second-biggest oil company, sold $1.75 billion
of 3.245 percent 10-year notes and $1.25 billion of 1.846
percent five-year bonds, its largest single-day issuance in a
year. The oil explorer’s financing arm, BP Capital Markets,
issued the five-year debt at a spread of 103 basis points with a
133 basis-point premium for the 10-year bonds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
