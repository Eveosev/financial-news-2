Trump National Golf Club , a course
owned by real estate developer  Donald Trump , will host the 2017
U.S. Women’s Open golf tournament, according to two  U.S. Golf
Association  officials who declined to be identified.  Trump National’s Old Course, which opened in 2004 in
Bedminster,  New Jersey , is about a 40-minute drive west of
 Manhattan . It’s also about five minutes from the Far Hills, New
Jersey, headquarters of the USGA, which decides on host courses
for the tournament first held in 1895. The people were granted
anonymity because an official announcement hasn’t been made.  The USGA has scheduled a press conference at the club for
tomorrow with Trump; Mike Davis, the USGA’s executive director;
and Dot Paluck, head of the USGA’s Women’s Committee, to
announce the site of a major championship.  “We’re very proud and excited to be hosting what will be
our third national championship in nine years at Bedminster,”
Dave Schutzenhofer, General Manager of Trump National, said in a
telephone interview without identifying the tournament. “This
facility was created to host national championships.”  Trump National, designed by Tom Fazio and opened in
September 2004 on a 525-acre facility previously owned by car
designer John DeLorean, also hosted the 2009 U.S. Junior and
U.S. Girl’s Junior tournaments.  The USGA previously announced sites for the U.S. Women’s
Open through 2015. The 2012 tournament will be held at Blackwolf
Run in Kohler, Wisconsin; the 2013 event will be at Sebonack
Golf Club in Southampton,  New York .  North Carolina ’s Pinehurst
No. 2 course will host the women’s Open in 2014, one week after
the men’s Open is played on the same course.  To contact the reporters on this story:
