Tyson Chandler  was named the  National
Basketball Association ’s Defensive Player of the Year, becoming
the first  New York  Knick to win the award.  Chandler received 45 first-place votes and 311 overall
points from a panel of 121 sports writers and broadcasters,
topping runner-up Serge Ibaka of the Oklahoma City Thunder, who
collected 41 first-place votes and 294 points, the NBA said
today in a news release.  Orlando Magic center  Dwight Howard  received 18 first-place
votes and 186 points to finish third.  Players were awarded five points for a first-place vote,
three for a second-place vote and one for a third-place vote.  Chandler, a 29-year-old center, averaged 1.4 blocks and a
career-high 0.9 steals per game during the lockout-shortened 66-
game regular season. He also averaged 11.3 points and 9.9
rebounds per contest while hitting 68 percent of his field goal
attempts for the Knicks, who are trailing the  Miami Heat  2-0 in
their best-of-seven first-round Eastern Conference playoff
series.  New York opponents shot .438 from the field when Chandler
was in the lineup, compared to .520 when he was on
the bench. Knicks’ opponents averaged 94.7 points per game this 
season, Chandler’s first in New York. Last season the franchise 
allowed 105.7 points per contest.  New York acquired Chandler as part of a three-team trade
with the  Dallas Mavericks  and  Washington Wizards  in December.
The Knicks sent center Ronny Turiaf and a 2013 second-round
draft pick to the Wizards and guard Andy Rautins to Dallas.  The Mavericks opted not to re-sign Chandler after he helped
them win their first NBA championship, averaging 10.1 points and
9.4 rebounds last season.  With Chandler on their roster this year, the Knicks ended
the regular-season in seventh place in the Eastern Conference.  The Defensive Player of the Year was first awarded for the
1982-83 season, with Milwaukee Bucks guard Sidney Moncrief
winning the first two awards. Howard won the title the past
three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
