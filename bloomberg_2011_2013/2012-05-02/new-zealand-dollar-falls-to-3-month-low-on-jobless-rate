The  New Zealand  dollar fell to its
lowest level in more than three months after a report today
showed the jobless rate unexpectedly rose.  The so-called kiwi weakened versus all of its major peers
and the two-year swap rate matched a record low after
 unemployment  exceeded the most pessimistic forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists. The currency also slid
after a purchasing managers’ index yesterday showed euro-region
 manufacturing  contracted for a ninth month. Australia’s dollar
dropped for a fourth day versus its U.S. peer as Asian stocks
declined, snapping a three-day gain.  “The overall unemployment headline number is worse,” said
 Tim Kelleher , Auckland-based head of institutional foreign-
exchange sales at ASB Institutional, a unit of  Commonwealth Bank
of Australia. (CBA)  “It’s obviously higher than the market expected.
The kiwi didn’t like the data initially on the knee-jerk
number.”  The New Zealand dollar lost 0.5 percent to 80.65 U.S. cents
as of 4:23 p.m. in Sydney after earlier dropping to 80.41 cents,
matching the lowest level since Jan. 23. It fell 0.4 percent to
64.72 yen, after sliding to 64.43, the lowest since Feb. 14. The
so-called Aussie retreated 0.2 percent to $1.0308 and declined
0.1 percent to 82.73 yen.  New Zealand’s  two-year swap rate , a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates, fell 10 1/2 basis points to 2.60
percent, matching the Nov. 24 low which is the least recorded in
Bloomberg data going back to 1993. The yield on  Australia ’s 10-
year note dropped seven basis points to 3.58 percent. It reached
a record low of 3.53 percent on May 1.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index  of shares lost
0.3 percent, paring this week’s gain to 1.3 percent.  Japan ’s
markets are shut today and tomorrow for public holidays.  Jobless Rate  New Zealand’s unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent in the
three months through March 31, the highest since 2010, from a
revised 6.4 percent in the previous quarter, the country’s
statistics office said today in Wellington. Economists predicted
a 6.3 percent rate.  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand Governor Alan Bollard has kept
the official cash rate at a record-low 2.5 percent since March
last year and signaled last month that level remained
appropriate amid benign inflation.  “Should the  exchange rate  remain strong without anything
else changing, the Bank would need to reassess the outlook for
monetary policy settings,” he said in an April 26 statement.  New Zealand’s dollar has advanced 1.8 percent this year,
the best performer after the British pound and the Norwegian
krone among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes.  ‘Scope to Ease’  Today’s New Zealand unemployment report may contribute to
lowering the central bank’s inflation outlook and may “create
scope to ease monetary policy,”  Matthew Johnson , an interest-
rate strategist at UBS AG in Sydney, wrote in a note today.  The probability of a reduction in the benchmark  interest
rate  by September has climbed to more than 60 percent from less
than 50 percent yesterday, according to swaps data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Demand for the kiwi was also tempered on signs  Europe ’s
economy is struggling to recover as it deals with its debt
crisis.  London-based Markit Economics said yesterday its purchasing
managers’ index of euro-region manufacturing fell to a 34-month
low of 45.9 in April from 47.7 in March.  “Further tests of key support levels are likely for the
 New Zealand dollar  as global PMI releases falter,” Alex Sinton,
a senior dealer at ANZ National Bank Ltd. in Auckland, wrote in
a report today.  The Aussie dollar also weakened after a gauge of the
nation’s  services industry  released by Commonwealth Bank of
Australia and the Australian Industry Group fell to 39.6 in
April from 47 in March. That’s the weakest since March 2009.  The currency has lost 1.6 percent since April 27, set for
its first weekly slide in almost a month. The Australian dollar
climbed to NZ$1.2831, the strongest since March 23, before
trading at $1.2782, 0.3 percent above yesterday’s close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
