Minmetals Resources Ltd. (1208) , a unit of
 China â€™s largest metals trader, said its gold production climbed
62 percent in the first quarter, aided by high-grade ore from
its Sepon mine in Laos.  Output of the precious metal increased to 34,082 ounces
from 21,039 ounces a year earlier, Hong Kong-based Minmetals
said today in a statement. Copper cathode output rose 21 percent
to 22,246 tons from a year earlier.  Gold prices averaged $1,691 an ounce in the quarter on the
London Metal Exchange, compared with $1,387 an ounce a year
earlier, Minmetals said today. The forecast of 60,000 to 65,000
ounces of gold production from Sepon this year will be
maintained as ore supply from the mine is expected to decline in
second half, the company said.  While production of copper concentrate gained 47 percent to
6,010 metric tons, copper output fell 18 percent from the
previous quarter because of a decline in processing volumes and
the quality of copper ore, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
