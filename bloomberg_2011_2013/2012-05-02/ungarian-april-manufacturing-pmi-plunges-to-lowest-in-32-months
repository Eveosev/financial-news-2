Hungary’s  purchasing managers’ index 
plunged to 46.9 points in April, the lowest since August 2009,
the Hungarian company MLBKT said in a report today.  The PMI, as reported by the purchasing managers of 100
manufacturing companies, is a weighted average of five indexes:
new orders, production volume, employment, transportation time,
and purchased inventory. A reading below 50 indicates a decline
in output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
