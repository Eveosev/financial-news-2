SIC Insurance Co. (SIC) , the biggest insurer
in Ghana, said first-quarter profit rose 37 percent as net
premiums grew.  Net income increased to 8.6 million cedis ($4.7 million),
while net premiums in the three months through March climbed to
25.7 million cedis from 21 million cedis a year earlier, the
company said in a statement e-mailed by the Ghana Stock Exchange
today.  “Rigorous market penetration strategies such as the
introduction of new products, including e-insurance, improved
net premiums,” Nana Ama Ofowaah, a stock analyst at  Databank
Financial Services Ltd.  in Accra, said in an e-mailed comment
today. “The company also adopted a strategy to retain at least
90 percent of its business by rewarding its loyal clients.”  The company’s shares closed unchanged at 38 pesewas on the
 Ghana  Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
