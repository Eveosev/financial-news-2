Hog futures slumped to a 16-week low
on signs of increasing pork supplies in the U.S. amid weak
demand. Cattle also declined.  Hog  carcasses  in the U.S. averaged 209.61 pounds (95
kilograms) on April 30, up 0.9 percent from a year earlier, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. Spot-hog  prices  fell to
77.27 cents a pound yesterday, the lowest since January 2011,
USDA data show. Wholesale-pork  prices , a gauge of demand, are
down 8.7 percent this year, government data show.  “We’re still working with heavy weights,” Paul Beere, a
market advisor at Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc., said in a
telephone interview from Brookfield,  Wisconsin . “Those need to
come down. It almost looks like we’re going to miss out on a
seasonal rally this year. I think it’s because of the weights
being higher, and production being up.”  Hog futures for June settlement fell 1.6 percent to settle
at 84.45 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. After the close of regular trading, the price reached
84.175, the lowest since Jan. 10. The commodity has gained 0.2
percent this year.  Cattle futures for June delivery declined 0.6 percent to
settle at $1.12875 a pound on the CME. The price has dropped 7.1
percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose less than
0.1 percent to $1.54225 a pound in  Chicago .  To contact the reporter on this story:
