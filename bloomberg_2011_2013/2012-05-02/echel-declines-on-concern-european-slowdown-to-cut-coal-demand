OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s largest producer
of coal for steelmakers, fell the most in a week as the European
economic slowdown stoked concern demand for the commodity will
deteriorate.  Mechel slid 2.1 percent to 255 rubles by 4:07 p.m., the
biggest one-day drop since April 23. The stock declined as much
as 2.3 percent earlier.  The jobless rate in the 17-nation euro area increased to
10.9 percent in March from 10.8 percent in February, the
European Union statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
That’s the highest since April 1997, according to Bloomberg News
data. Separate reports showed euro-area manufacturing contracted
more than initially estimated in April and unemployment in
 Germany , the region’s largest economy, unexpectedly increased.  Europe  is Mechel’s second-largest market, accounting for 19
percent of its revenue in 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Mechel has retreated 5.8 percent this year and trades at
4.4 times estimated earnings.  Consol Energy Inc. (CNX) , the third-
largest U.S. coal producer and a member of the  S&P 500’s coal
and consumable fuel sub-industry index , trades for 17.2 times
estimated earnings, while the ratio for  Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) ,
the largest U.S. producer of the commodity, is 10.6.  To contact the reporters on this story:
