Morgan Stanley (MS)  hired Takashi Miura
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as a Tokyo-based credit
strategist, replacing Hidetoshi Ohashi.  Miura, who joined Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co.
yesterday, will cover Japanâ€™s credit markets including corporate
bonds and credit-default swaps, Natsuo Nishio, a spokesman for
the brokerage, said by telephone today. Miura had joined Goldman
in 2000 from Rating and Investment Information Inc., a Japanese
risk assessor, Nishio said.  Ohashi is leaving the firm at the end of June to start a
hedge fund, a person familiar with the matter said April 25,
asking not to be identified as the details are private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
