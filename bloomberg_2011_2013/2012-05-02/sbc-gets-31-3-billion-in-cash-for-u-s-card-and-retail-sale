HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest
bank, completed the sale of its U.S. credit card unit to  Capital
One Financial Corp. (COF)  for a premium of $2.5 billion.  The lender received $31.3 billion of cash for the sale and
customer balances of the U.S. card and consumer services
division, the London-based bank said in a statement today. HSBC
agreed to sell the business last August.  The purchase from HSBC with the acquisition of ING’s U.S.
online bank will allow Capital One, which gets more than half
its revenue from credit cards, to expand even as slowing U.S.
growth caps loan demand. The deal also takes HSBC Chief
Executive Officer Stuart Gulliver a step closer to focusing
operations on faster-growing markets and U.K. consumer banking.  “The consideration and premium are subject to an
adjustment based on final closing balances,” HSBC said in the
statement. HSBC forecast a $2.6 billion premium in August as
loan balances were higher.  While HSBC Finance Corp. will cease issuing credit cards,
HSBC Bank U.S.A. will continue to do so, the lender said. HSBC
is selling part of the HSBC Bank U.S.A. credit card business and
its upstate New York branch network to  First Niagara Financial
Group Inc. (FNFG) , the bank said.  -- Editors: Jon Menon,  Keith Campbell   To contact the reporter on this story:
