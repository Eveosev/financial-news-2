Shinhan Financial Group Co. (055550) ,  South
Korea ’s largest financial company by market value, said first-
quarter profit fell 11 percent after the company set aside more
funds for bad loans as the economy slows.  Net income  dropped to 826.3 billion won ($733 million) in
the three months ended March 31 from 924.3 billion won a year
earlier, the Seoul-based company said in an e-mailed statement
today. That compares with the 766.1 billion won average of 20
analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings at South Korean banks fell last quarter as loans
became less profitable and lenders set aside more cash for
soured debt, a regulatory report showed this week. Shinhan joins
 KB Financial Group Inc. (105560) , owner of South  Korea ’s largest lender,
in posting lower net income for the quarter.  “Shinhan and other banks are facing a burden of growing
provisions and interest margin will likely remain flat for the
rest of the year,” Yoo Sang Ho, an analyst at Seoul-based HI
Investment & Securities Co., said before today’s report. “While
there’s no risk of further deterioration in earnings, it’s hard
to expect banks’ shares to outperform the overall market under
current macro-economic conditions.”  Shares of Shinhan Financial climbed 0.3 percent to 39,600
won at the close of Seoul trading before the earnings were
announced. The stock has slid 0.4 percent this year, compared
with the benchmark Kospi index’s 9.5 percent gain.  Bad Loans Rise  Shinhan’s non-performing loans rose to 1.45 percent of
total credit last quarter from 1.25 percent three months
earlier, today’s statement showed. The bank set aside 257.1
billion won for potential loan losses, 45 percent more than a
year earlier, led by increases at its credit card unit.  Interest income at Shinhan gained 2.9 percent last quarter
from a year earlier to 1.76 trillion won. Net interest margin, a
measure of profitability from lending, narrowed to 2.57 percent
at the banking and credit card units from 2.72 percent a year
earlier and 2.58 percent in the previous quarter.  South Korean banks’ combined first-quarter profit declined
17 percent from a year earlier to 3.7 trillion won, the
Financial Supervisory Service said on April 29. Non-performing
loan provisions climbed 27 percent and net interest margin
narrowed to 2.16 percent from 2.35 percent a year earlier.  Profit at Shinhan Card Ltd., the country’s biggest credit
card issuer, which usually  contributes about a quarter  of
Shinhan’s group profit, dropped 25 percent from a year earlier
on higher provisions and weaker fee income, according to today’s
statement.  KB Financial, Hana  KB Financial said last week that net income fell 20 percent
last quarter to 603.2 billion won as the lending margin
narrowed. Profit at  Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790) , South Korea’s
fourth-largest lender by assets, fell about 26 percent to 281.4
billion won when excluding a 1 trillion won accounting gain from
its purchase of  Korea Exchange Bank (004940)  in February.  South Korea’s  economy expanded  2.8 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace in more than two
years, the central bank said on April 26. The economy grew 0.9
percent from the previous quarter.  The  Bank of Korea  reduced its growth forecast for this year
to 3.5 percent from 3.7 percent on April 16, citing risks from
the  European debt crisis  and high  oil prices .  To contact the reporter on this story:
