Spain  can finance itself on the
 capital markets  even though its  interest rates  are high,
Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said.  “We are watching it very closely, in terms of the
financial capacity,” Fekter told reporters before a meeting of
European Union finance chiefs in Brussels today. “Spain can
still get money on the capital markets, even if it’s
expensive.”  Spain’s  10-year borrowing costs  have jumped 1 percentage
point to 5.85 percent since the government said in early March
that it wouldn’t meet its 2012  budget deficit  target, set by the
European Commission, as the economy sinks into its second
 recession  since 2009.  Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s People’s Party government,
in power since December, has tightened rules to force lenders to
recognize deeper real-estate losses, in a bid to convince the
 bond market  that bank losses won’t overburden public finances.  “Spanish banks are above even the strictest Basel III
ratios concerning the levels and the quality of capital,”
Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said in Brussels today.
“Spanish banks are among the least indebted, guaranteeing their
solvency and capacity to withstand the crisis.”  De Guindos said on April 30 that he expected more bank
mergers and efforts to clean up balance sheets. He reiterated
that Spain won’t seek a European bailout for its lenders.  “Spain has very responsible government which is determined
to do everything that is necessary to maintain Spain’s fiscal
stability,” Polish Finance Minister  Jacek Rostowski  said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
