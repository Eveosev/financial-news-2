Bank of America Corp.  asked a judge to
reject a demand for loan files in litigation over the bank’s
proposed $8.5 billion mortgage-bond settlement, saying it
threatens years of delay.  The files are irrelevant to the case and producing them for
investors would “dramatically transform” the proceeding, Bank
of America said in papers filed today in  New York  State Supreme
Court in Manhattan.  “Loan-file review will answer no questions,” the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender said. “It will lead only
to interminable delay and unnecessary litigation, loan-by-loan-
by-loan. It will bog down this proceeding for no good reason.”  The settlement with Countrywide Financial mortgage-bond
investors is before a state judge for approval, and some
investors have said they need information related to the
agreement and negotiations leading up to it.  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  and Walnut Place are
“leading the charge” on getting the loan files, Bank of
America said. A sample of loan files that was requested would
total more than 200 million pages and “require untold years to
evaluate,” the bank said.  Michael Rollin, an attorney for AIG, said in an e-mail that
Bank of America’s position “is without merit and we are looking
forward to addressing the issue with the court.”  An attorney for Walnut Place didn’t respond to an e-mail
seeking comment.  The case is In the matter of the application of the Bank of
New York Mellon, 651786-2011, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
