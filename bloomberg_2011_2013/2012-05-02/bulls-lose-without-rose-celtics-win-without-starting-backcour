The  Chicago Bulls  lost their first
playoff game without  Derrick Rose . The  Boston Celtics  overcame
the absence of their starting backcourt to defeat Atlanta.  The Philadelphia 76ers outscored the top-seeded Bulls 36-14
in the third quarter and went on to a 109-92 victory in Chicago
to even their best-of-seven National Basketball Association
first-round series at one game apiece.  It was Chicagoâ€™s first game since Rose, the reigning NBA
Most Valuable Player, was lost for the rest of the playoffs with
a knee injury.  Jrue Holiday had 26 points on 11-for-15 shooting and Lou
Williams added 20 points for the eighth-seeded 76ers, who hit 59
percent of their shots. Joakim Noah led Chicago with 21 points.  Paul Pierce had 36 points and 14 rebounds for the Celtics,
who were missing point guard  Rajon Rondo  because of a suspension  and shooting guard Ray Allen because of injury.  The Celtics, who trailed by five points after three
quarters, outscored Atlanta 26-14 in the fourth period.  Joe Johnson had 22 points for the Hawks at Philips Arena in  Atlanta. The series is tied 1-1.  The third games of the two series are set for May 4, in
Boston and Philadelphia.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
