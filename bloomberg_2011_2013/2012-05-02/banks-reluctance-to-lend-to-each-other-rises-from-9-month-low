European banks’ reluctance to lend to
one another rose from the lowest level in nine months, according
to a money-market indicator.  The  Euribor-OIS spread , the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was 40 basis
points at 8:45 a.m. in  London  from 39 yesterday, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The measure reached 38.9 basis points on
April 20, the lowest since the beginning of August.  The cost for banks to convert euro interest payments into
dollars fell. The three-month cross-currency  basis swap  was 44
basis points below Euribor from 45 yesterday.  The one-year basis swap was 48.5 basis points less than
Euribor from minus 51 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01
