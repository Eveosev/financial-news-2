Singapore time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
dropped 0.3 percent to 1,584.8789.  CRUDE OIL  Oil slid from the highest level in five weeks after an
industry report showed crude stockpiles increased in the U.S.,
countering signs of an economic revival in the world’s biggest
consumer of the commodity.  Crude for June delivery slid as much as 39 cents to $105.77
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . It was at $106 at 3:11 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract yesterday rose $1.29 to $106.16, the highest close
since March 27. Futures are up 7.3 percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  OIL PRODUCTS  Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude
futures fell to $75.26 a metric ton today from $94.16 on April
30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There was no oil
trading yesterday on the Platts system in Singapore because of a
public holiday. The spread, a measure of the profitability from
making the gasoline and petrochemical feedstock, is the
narrowest since Jan. 4.  Naphtha swaps for June dropped $19.05, or 1.9 percent, to
$975.20 a ton at 11:06 a.m. Singapore time, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.  The premium of gasoil to Dubai crude, a benchmark price for
 Asia , rose 50 cents, or 3 percent, to $17.39 a barrel, PVM data
showed. The spread is at the widest since Feb. 10. Singapore
gasoil swaps for June rose 50 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $133.40
a barrel.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold declined for a second day as manufacturing in the U.S.
and China improved, adding to evidence of a global recovery,
while data showed holdings in exchange-traded products dropped
to the lowest level in three months.  Spot gold fell as much as 0.6 percent to $1,653 an ounce
and traded at $1,653.65 at 3:45 p.m. in Singapore, after
dropping from a two-week high yesterday. Holdings in ETPs lost
0.2 percent to 2,381.568 metric tons yesterday, the smallest
amount since Feb. 1, according to data tracked by Bloomberg.  Cash platinum, this year’s best-performing precious metal,
fell 0.3 percent to $1,566.50 an ounce. One ounce of platinum
bought as little as 0.9377 ounce of gold yesterday, the least
since Feb. 16, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
ratio was last at 0.9464.  BASE METALS
Copper declined as improving manufacturing in  China  may reduce
pressure on policy makers to loosen monetary policies, curbing
demand for the metal in the largest user.  The metal for delivery in three months fell as much as 1
percent to $8,357.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
and traded at $8,395 by 3:16 p.m. Shanghai time. July-delivery
metal on the Comex dropped 0.4 percent to $3.8265 per pound.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn dropped for a second day as rains boosted soil
moisture in the U.S., improving crop prospects in the world’s
largest grower and exporter of the grain.  July-delivery corn lost as much as 0.9 percent to $6.2325 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at $6.265 as of
3:20 p.m.  Singapore  time. Wheat for July delivery slipped 0.6
percent to $6.3925 a bushel.  Soybeans for delivery in July fell 0.6 percent to $14.945 a
bushel. Futures rose on April 30 to $15.07 a bushel, the highest
intraday price for the most-active contract since July 2008.  Rubber climbed to the highest level in three weeks after
data showed manufacturing in the U.S. grew and auto sales topped
analysts’ forecasts in April, boosting the demand outlook for
the commodity used in tires and gloves.  The October-delivery contract gained as much as 1.2 percent
to 317.6 yen a kilogram ($3,965 a metric ton), the highest price
since April 11. Futures traded at 317 yen on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange at 11:42 a.m.  Palm oil  fell for a second day after a U.S. government
report showed that farmers accelerated soybean planting, easing
concerns about dwindling cooking-oil supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
