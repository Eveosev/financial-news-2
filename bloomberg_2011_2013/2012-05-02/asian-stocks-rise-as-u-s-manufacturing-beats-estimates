Asian  stocks  gained as manufacturing
in the U.S. and  China  improved in April, adding to signs the
world’s two biggest economies are recovering and boosting the
outlook for the region’s exporters.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the world’s No. 1 mobile-phone
maker by sales, climbed 1.4 percent in Seoul. Japan Tobacco Inc.
gained 2.4 percent after Asia’s largest cigarette maker said it
will raise its dividend payout. Idemitsu Kosan Co. jumped 4.6
percent after Japan’s third-biggest oil refiner posted earnings
that beat expectations.  Asustek (2357)  Computer Inc. surged 7 percent
in Taipei after the laptop maker reported net income that
exceeded analysts’ estimates.  “I’m not that worried about growth in China,” said
Masahiko Ejiri, a senior  fund manager  in  Tokyo  at Mizuho Asset
Management Co., which oversees $39 billion. “We are quite
positive about the Chinese economy and the prospects for the
equity market. There will be more enthusiasm coming for the
second half of the year.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.5 percent to 124.86 as
of 5:10 p.m. in Tokyo, with more than two shares rising for each
that fell. The gauge dropped 2.8 percent in March and April amid
concern  Europe  will be trapped in a recession as debt-stricken
nations such as Spain cut spending and as Chinese economic
growth slows.  South Korea’s Kospi Index rose 0.9 percent, while Taiwan’s
Taiex Index climbed 2.3 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
gained 0.1 percent. Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  added 0.3

least 6.8 percent higher than the 30-day average, while those in
Japan were 28 percent below, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg News.  A Chinese manufacturing index compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics rose in April, signaling a rebound in the
world’s second-biggest economy. A government report yesterday
showed China’s manufacturing expanded last month at the fastest
pace in a year.  Exporters advanced as the Chinese data, combined with a U.S.
report that showed production at U.S. factories unexpectedly
expanded, bolstered optimism the world’s biggest economies will
weather Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  Samsung Electronics rose 1.4 percent to 1.41 million won in
Seoul. Li & Fung Ltd., a supplier of toys and clothes to Wal-
Mart Stores Inc., advanced 2.2 percent to HK$16.96 in Hong Kong.
Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd., a maker of shoes for Nike
Inc., climbed 3.9 percent to HK$27.  Japan Tobacco  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The gauge advanced 0.6 percent in  New York 
yesterday and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rallied 0.5
percent to close at the highest level since December 2007.  Japan Tobacco (2914)  gained 2.4 percent to 446,500 yen in Tokyo.
The company will raise its dividend payout ratio to 50 percent
and increase prices to make up for low sales volume in Japan,
the Nikkei newspaper reported, citing incoming President
Mitsuomi Koizumi.  Idemitsu jumped 4.6 percent to 7,530 yen after posting
full-year profit of 64.4 billion yen ($802 million), beating
analysts’ estimates of 55.8 billion yen. Asustek surged 7
percent to NT$315.50 in Taipei after reporting first-quarter net
income of NT$5 billion ($171 million), 28 percent higher than
expectations.  OCI, Gome  OCI Co., South Korea’s biggest maker of polysilicon used in
solar panels, surged 9.1 percent to 233,500 won, the best
performer on the regional index, on speculation industry
oversupply will ease after China’s LDK Solar Co. cut workers and
delayed expansion plans.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose 9.2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with an 11.8 percent gain by the  S&P
500  and a 5.7 percent advance by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Shares on the Asian benchmark are  valued  at 12.6 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with a multiple of 13.4 times for
the S&P 500 and 10.8 times for the Stoxx 600.  Among stocks that fell, Gome Electrical Appliances Holding
Ltd. slumped 11 percent to HK$1.24, its lowest close since June
2009, after China’s second-biggest electronics retailer forecast
a drop in first-quarter earnings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
