German labor union Ver.di repeated its
call for a 6 percent wage increase for 220,000 workers at the
nation’s banks before a third round of talks start this week.  “We expect both private and public banks to finally
present a negotiable offer,” Beate Mensch, who is leading the
wage negotiations with employers on behalf of Ver.di, said in a
statement today. “Such a step is not only important for the
employees but for the whole industry.”  The pay demands may increase banks’ costs as German lenders
work to fill a 13.1 billion-euro ($17.2 billion) capital hole
identified by European regulators and the sovereign debt crisis
weighs on earnings. Moderate wage claims that helped  Germany 
climb out of recession in 2009 are being abandoned in industries
from banks to engineering and public services, helping support
private consumption.  Ver.di and the banks will resume negotiations on May 4 in
 Frankfurt . The union won a 6.5 percent wage increase last month
for about 2 million public-sector workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
