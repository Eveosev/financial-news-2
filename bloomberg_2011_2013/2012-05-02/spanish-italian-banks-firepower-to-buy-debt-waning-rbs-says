Italian and Spanish banks are running
out of cash borrowed through the  European Central Bank ’s three-
year-loan program, diminishing their “firepower” to buy
 government bonds , according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  Banks in  Italy  have spent the equivalent of 46.4 percent of
the funds they received from the longer-term refinancing
operations, while Spanish ones have used up 42.3 percent,
Harvinder Sian, Biagio Lapolla and Simon Peck, interest-rate
strategists in  London , wrote in a note to clients on April 30,
citing ECB data for the period from December to March.  Assuming the banks intended to use about half of the funds
to buy higher-yielding sovereign bonds, Italian lenders would
have had 6 billion euros ($7.93 billion) left by the end of
March, and Spanish banks would have had 16 billion euros
remaining, the analysts wrote.  Had they to assigned 65 percent of the LTRO cash for
government debt, they’d have had 31 billion euros and 46 billion
euros still to spend, according to the note. Based on the rate
of purchases in March, that would have meant another 1.6 months
of bond purchases for  Spain  and less than a month’s worth for
Italy, the analysts said.  “Aggressive buying done to date means that the remaining
firepower from the LTRO for the European government bond markets
is lower,” the analysts wrote. “Domestic bank support is
likely to fade even further.”  Spanish bonds were the worst-performing of 26 sovereign-
debt markets tracked by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies in April, with losses of 1.8
percent. Italian securities were second worst, dropping 1.3
percent, after gaining 11 percent in the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
