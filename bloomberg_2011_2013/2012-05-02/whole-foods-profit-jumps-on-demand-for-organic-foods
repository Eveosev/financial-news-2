Whole Foods Market Inc. (WFM) , the largest
U.S. natural-goods grocer, posted second-quarter profit that
topped analysts’ estimates on increased demand for organic
foods.  Net income  climbed 31 percent to $117.7 million, or 64
cents a share, from $89.9 million, or 51 cents, a year earlier,
the Austin, Texas-based company said today in a statement.
Excluding some items, profit was 64 cents a share. Analysts
projected 59 cents, the average of 23  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Co-Chief Executive Officers Walter Robb and John Mackey
have pushed the company’s 365 Everyday Value brand to attract
shoppers looking for more affordable choices. The chain of more
than 300 stores, which has also been working to lure nutrition-
conscious consumers, is opening more locations in urban areas to
expand sales.  “Sales trends remain strong as it appears that the growth
of the natural and organic industry has accelerated,” Meredith Adler, an analyst for Barclays Plc., wrote in a note to clients
before the results were announced.  Whole Foods rose 2.8 percent to $86.63 at 4:22 p.m. in  New
York . At the close, the  shares  had gained 21 percent this year.  The company boosted its full-year earnings forecast. Profit
will be as much as $2.47 a share for the fiscal year, up from a
previous prediction of a maximum of $2.32. Analysts had
projected $2.34, the average of 14 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Sales in the quarter ended April 8 rose 14 percent to $2.67
billion, matching the average of 19 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
