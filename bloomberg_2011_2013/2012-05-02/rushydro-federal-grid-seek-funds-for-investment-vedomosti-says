State-run energy companies including
OAO RusHydro and Federal Grid Co. are looking at new ways to
finance their investment programs amid caps on how much they can
raise prices, Vedomosti  reported .  The federal government plans to set aside 22 billion rubles
($750 million) for RusHydro this year and 42 billion rubles next
year to help finance the companyâ€™s 350 billion ruble investment
program for 2012 to 2014, the Moscow-based newspaper reported,
citing a Finance Ministry proposal.  Federal Grid will partially finance its 592.3 billion ruble
investment program to 2014 by selling debt, Vedomosti reported.
The board of directors on April 27 approved plans to sell as
much as 325 billion rubles in debt, though it is not planning to
raise the full amount, the newspaper said, citing an
unidentified company spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
