Sul America SA (SULA11)  rose to a four-week
high after the Brazilian insurer’s first-quarter profit
increased 11 percent, exceeding analysts’ estimates.  Shares  gained  0.9 percent to 15.71 reais at the close in
Sao Paulo. The benchmark Bovespa index advanced 1 percent.
Markets were closed yesterday for a holiday.  Net income was 112.8 million reais ($58.7 million) in the
quarter, compared with 101.9 million reais a year earlier,
according to a regulatory filing April 30 after the markets
closed. The result  exceeded  the average estimate for an adjusted
profit of 107.7 million reais in a Bloomberg survey of three
analysts  The results “showed a good expansion in terms of premiums,
mainly driven by the health segment,” analysts Carlos Firetti,
Rafael Frade and Gustavo Lobo at Banco Bradesco BBI wrote in a
report dated April 30.  Sul America’s insurance premiums rose 15 percent in the
first quarter to 2.5 billion reais, “benefiting from a robust
domestic economy,” among other factors, the company said in the
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
