OAO Novatek,  Russia ’s second-largest
natural-gas producer, slumped to its lowest in seven months
after a finance ministry official said the government approved
quadrupling the mineral-extraction tax.  Novatek sank 10 percent to 340.85 rubles by the close in
Moscow, the lowest since Oct. 4 and the biggest drop on the
benchmark 30-stock Micex Index today. The company’s  London-
traded shares  lost 9.1 percent to $113.  Independent gas producers, which include Novatek and  oil
companies , will pay 1,049 rubles per 1,000 cubic meters of gas
produced in 2015, compared with 251 rubles this year, Deputy
Finance Minister  Sergei Shatalov  told reporters in Moscow today
after a government meeting.  OAO Gazprom, Russia’s gas export monopoly, erased gains of
as much as 1.6 percent to close down 1.1 percent at 167.34
rubles. Gazprom will be taxed at 1,062 rubles per 1,000 cubic
meters of gas produced in 2015, Shatalov said. That compares
with a rate of 509 rubles this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
