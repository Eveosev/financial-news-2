French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  told
Socialist rival  Francois Hollande  that he won’t accept lessons
from the political party that was home to former International
Monetary Fund managing director  Dominique Strauss-Kahn .  “I won’t accept lessons from a political party that was
enthusiastically uniting behind Dominique Strauss-Kahn,”
Sarkozy said in a hard-fought debate four days before France’s
election.  Strauss-Kahn left his job at the IMF last year after facing
charges of raping a maid in a  New York  hotel room. Prosecutors
later dropped the case. The former Socialist minister also
dropped his ambitions to run for the French presidency following
the scandal.  “I was sure you were going to bring that up,” Hollande
retorted. “You put him at the head of the IMF.”  The DSK spat marked the climax a 2-hour long heated and
angry debate. Sarkozy repeatedly accused his rival of lying.
Hollande attacked Sarkozy saying “you are always so content
with yourself. French people are less so.”  Both candidates sought to distance themselves from Strauss-
Kahn. “I know him less well than you,” Sarkozy said. Hollande
replied: “I don’t know him.”  Sarkozy is behind Hollande in the polls. French voters cast
their ballots on May 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the reporters on this story:
