OAO Rosneft said profit fell 7.4
percent in the first quarter after Russia’s biggest oil producer
lost tax benefits at its largest new crude development.  Net income dropped to 112 billion rubles ($3.8 billion)
from 121 billion rubles in the year-earlier period, the Moscow-
based company said today in a statement. That beat the 88
billion-ruble average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “The expiration of reduced mineral extraction tax rates
and export duties for oil produced at the Vankor field” was
behind lower earnings, Rosneft said in the statement. The
company lost preferential tax treatment for Vankor last year.  Revenue advanced 27 percent to 748 billion rubles. Russia’s
Urals export blend rose 14 percent to average $116.98 a barrel
in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Net debt grew 66 percent to 527 billion rubles after
Rosneft invested in refinery upgrades and oil production
projects, according to the statement.  Oil and gas output increased to 2.63 million barrels of oil
equivalent a day from 2.56 million barrels a day in the period a
year earlier, Rosneft said.  Rosneft switched to International Financial Reporting
Standards this year from U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
