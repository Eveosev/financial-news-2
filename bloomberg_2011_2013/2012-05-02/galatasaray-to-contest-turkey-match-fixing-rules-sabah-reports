Galatasaray (GSRAY) , the top contender for
 Turkey ’s soccer league championship this year, is planning to
file a legal appeal against the Turkish Football Federation for
abusing their authority in connection with a match-fixing probe,
Sabah reported.  The Istanbul-based club, with the most titles behind last
year’s champion Fenerbahce, will also seek to nullify changes to
regulations that added a point-reduction system which may be
used to prevent relegation of teams if they’re found guilty of
chicanery, according to the newspaper.  TFF Chairman Yildirim Demiroren announced an executive
committee decision to revise match-fixing penalties on April 30,
more than a month after the general assembly rejected the
measure, Sabah said, citing Galatasaray’s objection filed with
the soccer authority. The federation needs to abide by
guidelines set out by FIFA and UEFA, respectively the world’s
and  Europe ’s top soccer authorities, thus sanctions against
chicanery can only be changed with a general assembly vote,
Galatasaray said, according to the newspaper.  The TFF refered 16 of the 18 teams in the top league to the
disciplinary committee in connection with 22 matches last year
that may have been rigged, Sabah said. Other clubs oppose the
TFF move as well, with Kayserispor and Bursaspor refusing to
submit a defense to the disciplinary committee, the newspaper
reported, citing statements from the teams.  Turkish prosecutors unveiled a match-fixing probe in July,
implicating teams including  Fenerbahce (FENER) , Trabzonspor and cup
winner Besiktas, which Demiroren chaired before taking up the
top post in the TFF.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
