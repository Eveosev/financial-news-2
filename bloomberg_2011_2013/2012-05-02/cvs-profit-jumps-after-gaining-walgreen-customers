CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) , the largest
provider of  prescription drugs  in the U.S., reported first-
quarter profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates after grabbing
customers from  Walgreen Co. (WAG)   Net income in the quarter ended March 31 rose 8.8 percent
to $776 million, or 59 cents a share, from $713 million, or 52
cents, a year earlier, the Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based
company said today in a statement. Excluding certain items,
profit totaled 65 cents, compared to the 63-cent average of 20
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo increased marketing
this year to lure customers from Walgreen, boosting demand for
prescriptions and general merchandise. Walgreen has lost
customers after its contract to sell prescriptions through
employee-benefits manager  Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX)  ended Dec. 31
amid a reimbursement dispute.  “We didn’t know it was going to be this good,” Judson Clark, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. in Des Peres,
Missouri, said today in a telephone interview. “The customers
bringing over prescriptions from Walgreen are probably going to
stay with CVS regardless of what happens between  Express Scripts 
and Walgreen,” said Clark, who recommends buying CVS shares.  CVS  rose  2.7 percent to $45.92 at the close in  New York .
The shares have gained 13 percent this year.  CVS boosted its full-year earnings forecast, citing
benefits from the dispute between Walgreen and Express Scripts.
Earnings this year will be as much as $3.33 a share, up from a
previous projection of a maximum of $3.28. Analysts predicted
$3.29, the average of 20  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Total revenue in the first quarter increased 20 percent to
$30.8 billion. Analysts projected $30.3 billion, the average of
17 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue in the pharmacy services business rose 32 percent
to $18.3 billion in the quarter, while revenue in the retail
pharmacy business increased 9.9 percent to $16 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
