The Czech  PX (PX)  equity index dropped 0.5
percent to 934.5 by 1:12 p.m. in Prague, ending a two-day gain.  The following are among the most active  stocks  in the Czech
market today. Equity symbols follow company names.  Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CETV)  , known as
CME, jumped 4.9 percent to 155 koruna, poised for its highest
close in more than two months. The broadcaster said yesterday it
has secured a $300 million loan from Time Warner Inc., its
biggest shareholder to repay debts coming due next year.  Unipetrol AS (UNIP)  , the largest Czech oil refiner, fell
0.6 percent to 173 koruna. Komercni Banka AS cut its 12-month
price estimate for the stock to 137 koruna from 143 koruna in a
report to clients today, saying Unipetrol is “too expensive”
relative to peers while higher  oil prices  may dent profits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
