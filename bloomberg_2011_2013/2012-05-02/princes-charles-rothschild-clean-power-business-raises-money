Tamar Energy Ltd. (TVE) , a waste-to-power
business backed by U.K. financier Jacob Rothschild’s  RIT Capital
Partners Plc (RCP) , and the estate of Prince Charles, raised 7 million
pounds ($11.3 million) from  Ludgate Environmental Fund Ltd. (LEF)   Ludgate, a Jersey-based clean technology fund, made the
investment for Tamar to develop and build plants in the U.K.
that will use food and mixed waste to produce electricity,
according to an e-mailed statement today.  Tamar plans to build as many as 40 facilities over the next
five years for a total capacity of 100 megawatts. The company
also counts J Sainsbury Plc, the U.K.’s third-largest
supermarket owner, as an investor.  The U.K. is seeking to get 15 percent of its energy from
renewable sources by 2020. The Department of Energy and Climate
Change estimates as much as half of that may be generated from
biomass, which includes municipal waste, wood chips and straw.  Ludgate also invested 3.1 million pounds in Ignis Biomass
Ltd. for it to build a biomass power plant in Wick,  Scotland . In
addition it led a 5.3 million pound growth capital funding round
in Germany’s Micropelt GmbH alongside Mitsubishi UFJ Capital Co.
Micropelt has developed technology that uses waste heat to
generate electricity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
