Best Buy Co. (BBY)  said Barry Judge resigned
as chief marketing officer of the world’s largest consumer
electronics retailer.  Judge is “leaving the company to explore the next chapter
in his career,” Greg Hitt, a spokesman for Richfield,
Minnesota-based Best Buy, said today by e-mail. He declined to
say how Judge’s duties will be assigned other than that the
retailer will tap “the skills and experiences of other
additional senior leaders.”  Best Buy is searching for a new chief executive officer
following last month’s resignation of  Brian Dunn  at the outset
of a board investigation of his personal conduct. Judge was
named head of marketing in February 2008.  Best Buy slipped 1.6 percent to $22.10 at 4:15 p.m. in  New
York . The shares have dropped 5.4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
