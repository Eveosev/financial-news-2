Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , maker of the Camry
sedans and Prius hybrids, led sales of Asian automakers higher
in the U.S. last month, gaining market share as deliveries at
 General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Ford Motor Co. (F)  fell.  The Japanese carmaker posted a 12 percent sales increase
from a year earlier, topping eight analysts’ 10 percent average
estimate. Deliveries fell 2.2 percent at Honda Motor Co. and 0.3
percent at  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  South Korea’s  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and
 Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  had gains of 0.8 percent and 1 percent.  “Toyota’s recovery has been remarkable,” said  Jesse Toprak , industry analyst for TrueCar.com, an automotive pricing
and data service. “They’ve not only regained all the market
share lost last year, but at a much faster pace than we thought
they would.”  Toyota saw U.S. sales and market share contract in 2010 and
2011 from back-to-back crises.  Asia ’s largest automaker will
probably report its biggest profit in seven quarters next week,
according to the average  analyst estimate  compiled by Bloomberg,
after the company restored production disrupted by natural
disasters in  Japan  and  Thailand  last year.  April market share for Toyota rebounded to 15 percent, the
highest since December 2010, and rose to 14.3 percent so far
this year from 14.1 percent, according to Autodata, based in
 Woodcliff Lake , New Jersey. GM’s share of new vehicle sales fell
2.1 percentage points last month to 18 percent, and is down 1.9
percentage points to 17.7 percent this year, according to
Autodata Corp.  Year’s Fastest Pace  U.S. auto sales have gained 10 percent in the year’s first
four months, according to Autodata, helping to buoy a broader
improvement in the nation’s economy. Stronger demand for cars
and light trucks bolstered the U.S. manufacturing sector, which
grew in April at the fastest pace in almost a year, according to
the  Institute for Supply Management .  Industrywide sales of new autos grew 2.3 percent in April
to 1.18 million, according to Autodata, based in Woodcliff Lake,
 New Jersey . Chrysler Group LLC led gains for U.S.-based
automakers, with sales up 20 percent. GM, the world’s largest
automaker, reported an 8.2 percent decline and Ford said sales
fell 5.1 percent.  ‘Different Cycle’  “We’ve got ourselves steady, sustainable growth in the
market,” said Alan Baum, principal of  auto-industry  forecaster
Baum & Associates in West Bloomfield, Michigan. “The auto
industry is going through a little bit different cycle that is
obviously helping the overall economy.”  Sales of the Toyota, Lexus and Scion brands rose to 178,044
from 159,540 a year earlier, the Toyota City, Japan-based
company said. Toyota’s Camry, the best-selling car in the U.S.
for more than a decade, had a 21 percent gain in April, while
deliveries of the four-model Prius line more than doubled to
25,168.  “In terms of what the customer is looking for, MPG is
still top of mind,”  Bob Carter , Toyota’s group vice president
of U.S. sales, said in a conference call yesterday.  Prius outsold Corolla, typically Toyota’s No. 2 model by
sales after Camry, for the second consecutive month. That may
change later in the year as Corolla production expands at
Toyota’s Blue Springs,  Mississippi , plant, Carter said.  Toyota’s performance this year, led by sales of the Camry,
is a contrast to two years ago, when it coped with record
recalls for flaws linked to unintended acceleration, followed by
natural disasters that left Toyota and Lexus dealers short of
vehicle inventory reduced Toyota’s market share to 12.9 percent
last year from 17 percent in 2009.  Prius Goal  Toyota has a goal of selling at least 220,000 Prius models
this year in the U.S., as the addition of the v wagon, c
subcompact and plug-in Prius attract new customers. About 72
percent of Prius v buyers haven’t previously bought a Toyota
model, Carter said.  Lexus sales fell 0.1 percent in April and have grown only
2.6 percent this year. The luxury brand should post monthly
increases of at least 10 percent starting in May, with the
addition of models such as the new RX sport-utility vehicle and
ES sedan, said Tim Morrison, vice president of Lexus sales and
dealer development.  Toyota’s U.S. market share was 15 percent in April, up 1.2
percentage points from a year earlier, according to Autodata.  Honda’s 122,012 deliveries of Honda and Acura models were
fewer than April 2011’s 124,799. Still, the Tokyo-based
company’s decline was narrower than the average estimate of a
6.7 percent drop from eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Accord Gains  Accord sales rose 26 percent and the CR-V small crossover
had a 9 percent increase to 23,627 units. An 8.8 percent drop in
sales of the Civic compact, Honda’s second-biggest seller, cut
the carmaker’s total volume for the month.  Honda’s April market share was 10.3 percent, falling from
10.8 percent a year earlier, according to Autodata.  Sales for Yokohama, Japan-based Nissan dropped 0.3 percent
from April 2011, well short of the average estimate of a 19
percent increase from eight analysts.  Deliveries of the Altima sedan, Nissan’s biggest seller in
the U.S., fell 5.8 percent. The company also reduced incentives
and sold fewer vehicles to daily rental fleets, said David Reuter, a Nissan spokesman.  “All things being equal, Nissan buyers are particularly
sensitive to pricing,” said Toprak, the TrueCar analyst. “They
cut incentives by about $300 in April, and sales fell in line
with that.”  Hyundai Slows  Market share for Nissan was 6 percent last month, a drop of
0.2 percentage point, according to Autodata.  April’s slower sales pace meant Hyundai and affiliate Kia
reported their smallest increases in more than a year. Combined
sales for the two, which operate separately in the U.S., rose
0.9 percent to 109,814 cars and light trucks. That beat the
average estimate of six analysts for a 0.4 percent gain.  Adjusted for “selling days,” which exclude Sundays and
holidays, sales rose 26 percent at Toyota, 10 percent at Honda,
12 percent at Nissan and a combined 14 percent at Hyundai and
Kia. Some analysts exclude non-selling days to compare results
from a year earlier because many dealerships are closed.  April this year had three fewer selling days than in 2011.
Last month was just the second in the past 10 years with such a
wide disparity,  Jim Cain , a GM spokesman, said in an e-mail.  Subaru, the auto brand of Japan’s  Fuji Heavy Industries
Ltd. (7270) , rose 6.3 percent last month, and  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) 
reported sales of 21,506 cars and trucks, up 4.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
