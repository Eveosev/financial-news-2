Kenya ’s shilling depreciated to the
lowest in almost three months on concern that the nation’s trade
deficit is widening.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.3 percent to 83.51 per dollar and was trading 0.2
percent weaker at 83.38 by 3:34 p.m. in Nairobi, set for the
lowest since Feb. 9.  Kenya’s trade deficit widened 24 percent in February to 58
billion shillings ($695 million), up from 46.8 billion shillings
a year earlier, as costs of imported food, machinery and
transport equipment rose, the Nairobi-based Kenya National
Bureau of Statistics said in a statement on its website on April
30.  Imports advanced to 102.1 billion shillings from 85.6
billion shillings as food costs more than doubled. Exports grew
to 44.1 billion shillings from 38.8 billion shillings, according
to the data.  “The shilling is feeling the pressure of a widening
balance of payment which despite all measures to support it has
not worked as the market sees a weaker shilling on account of
higher imports,” Duncan Kinuthia, a dealer at Nairobi-based
Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview today.
“The central bank committee is expected to retain the benchmark
rate at 18 percent tomorrow as it attempts to keep support for
the shilling in the medium term.”  The Central Bank of Kenya accepted all 3.25 billion
shillings in bids for seven-day  repurchase agreements  at a
weighted average rate of 16.369 percent, after offering 9
billion shillings of the securities, an official with the bank,
who declined to be named in line with policy, said by phone from
the capital.  Uganda ’s shilling climbed 0.2 percent to 2,500 per dollar,
while Tanzania’s shilling gained for the first day in two,
rising 0.2 percent to 1,585 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
