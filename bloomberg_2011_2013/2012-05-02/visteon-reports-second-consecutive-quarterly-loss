Visteon Corp. (VC) , the auto-parts maker
paring units to focus on faster-growing operations in Asia,
reported its second consecutive quarterly loss as it revamps
operations.  Visteon reported a first-quarter net loss of $29 million,
or 56 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $39
million, or 75 cents. The quarter included $63 million in
restructuring costs, including expenses from closing an
electronics plant in  Spain ,  Jim Fisher , a company spokesman,
said in an e-mail.  The results follow a fourth-quarter deficit of $26 million.
Prior to that, the company had recorded four straight profitable
quarters after it exited a 16-month bankruptcy in 2010.  Visteon, based in  Van Buren Township , Michigan, has been
plagued by losses since it was spun off in 2000 by  Ford Motor
Co. (F)  The supplier has expanded business with automakers other
than Ford and has narrowed its product offerings.  The company agreed to sell its lighting unit to Varroc
Group of India in March for $92 million. The unit, which
supplies automotive exterior lights, had revenue of $531 million
last year. Visteon Oct. 31 sold a part of its stake in Duckyang
Industry Co., an interiors joint venture, and it no longer had a
controlling interest.  The Duckyang transaction decreased first-quarter sales by
$114 million, Visteon said in todayâ€™s statement. Total sales for
the quarter slid 7.2 percent to $1.72 billion. The average
estimate of two analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for sales of
$1.77 billion.  Visteon also lowered its full-year sales forecast because
of paring units and divesting holdings.  Sales this year will be $6.6 billion to $7 billion, Visteon
said today in a statement. In February, the company forecast
sales of as much as $7.5 billion for the year. Free  cash flow 
will be $5 million to $30 million, compared with a February
forecast of $25 million to $50 million, Visteon said today.  Visteon slid 2.8 percent to $48.83 at the close in  New
York , the biggest drop since April 13. The shares have dropped
2.2 percent this year after falling 33 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
