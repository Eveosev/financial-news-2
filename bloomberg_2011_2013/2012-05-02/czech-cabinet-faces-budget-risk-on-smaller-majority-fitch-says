The Czech government’s reduced
majority following a breakup of the ruling coalition may make it
harder to meet plans to cut the budget deficit,  Fitch Ratings 
said.  April political events, in which the three-party coalition
disintegrated and the government won a confidence vote in
parliament, “do not in themselves have any implications” for
the country’s A+ rating with a stable outlook, Fitch said in an
e-mailed statement today. Premier Petr Necas’s Cabinet won
backing for its austerity plans from lawmakers that split from
the smallest member of the original coalition.  Necas is keeping his 20-month-old Cabinet in power as
governments crumble across  Europe  amid German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s push for austerity to prevent the euro area from
breaking up. The breakup of the Czech coalition followed clashes
over spending cuts and personnel issues as the Cabinet prepares
bills to cut the  budget deficit  to less than the European
Union’s limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product.  “The government’s smaller majority could make it harder to
deliver on its fiscal tightening plans, which envisage tax
increases and further spending cuts bringing the deficit below 3
percent of GDP in 2013,” Fitch said.  Necas’s original administration, assembled after May 2010
elections, had 118 mandates in the 200-seat lower house of
parliament. His Civic Democrats now have 51 seats, while the
TOP09 party holds 41 mandates. The government secured support
from 13 lawmakers outside the government parties in the April 27
confidence vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
