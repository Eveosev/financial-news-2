Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  dropped 1.8 percent to 58,943.71 at the close in Istanbul,
falling to the lowest since Feb. 27.  The following shares were active. Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  Anadolu Anonim Turk Sigorta Sirketi (ANSGR)  , a Turkish
non-life insurance company, dropped 2.2 percent to 90 kurus
after reporting a first-quarter loss of 7.81 million liras ($4.4
million), compared with a profit of 4.51 million liras in the
same period of 2011. The company’s income was hit by a declining
market share in the life insurance segment as it focused on
growing its pensions, which “have a brighter future,” Neslihan Karagoz, an analyst for Istanbul-based brokerage BGC Partners,
said in an e-mailed report today.  Arcelik AS (ARCLK)  , Turkey’s largest home appliances
maker, jumped as much as 1.3 percent and traded 0.3 percent
higher to 7.72 liras after it was upgraded to buy from hold at
UniCredit SpA.  Petkim Petrokimya Holding AS (PETKM) , Turkey’s biggest chemicals
maker, fell 1.4 percent to 2.06 liras, its lowest since Jan. 31,
after reporting a first-quarter loss of 7.9 million liras ($4.5
million), missing estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
