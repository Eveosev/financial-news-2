Standard & Poor’s ’ reduction of the
outlook on Turkey’s sovereign rating to stable indicates that
there’s “a less than one out of three likelihood of an
upgrade” over the next 12 months, the company said in an e-
mailed statement today.  S&P cut its outlook for Turkey’s long-term foreign and
local currency credit ratings to stable from positive yesterday,
citing concern about external demand and terms of trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
