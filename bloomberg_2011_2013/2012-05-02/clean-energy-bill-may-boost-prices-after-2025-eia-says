A U.S. bill that requires utilities to
increase their use of power generated by clean sources may drive
up power prices for consumers, though not for at least a decade,
according to the Energy Information Administration.  The  Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012  would increase power
prices by about 4 percent in 2025, compared with a reference
price in a draft of the EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2012, the
agency said today in a  statement  on its website.  That gap may increase to as much as 18 percent by 2035 as
utilities seek to reduce  carbon emissions  by shifting their mix
of power plants away from coal in favor of natural gas, nuclear
and renewable energy.  “Electricity prices, generally speaking, do not experience
a significant impact until after 2020,” according to the
report. EIA is part of the U.S. Energy Department.  The bill, introduced in March by New Mexico Democratic
Senator  Jeff Bingaman , would require utilities to sell an
increasing amount of power generated by “clean” sources
annually, starting in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
