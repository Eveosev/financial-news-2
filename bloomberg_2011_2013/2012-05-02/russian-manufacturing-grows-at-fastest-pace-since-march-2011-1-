Russian manufacturing grew in April at
the fastest pace in more than a year as output and employment
rose and new orders accelerated, HSBC Holdings Plc said.  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index increased to 52.9 in April,
the highest since March 2011, from 50.8 the previous month, HSBC
said in an e-mailed  statement  today, citing data compiled by
London-based Markit Economics. A level above 50 signals an
expansion, while below that shows a contraction.  The  International Monetary Fund  last month boosted its 2012
growth forecast for  Russia , the world’s largest energy exporter,
as higher  oil prices  shield the economy from a possible slump in
its biggest trading partners, the European Union and  China .
Improvements in manufacturing, which had been at the forefront
of the country’s economic expansion, suggest a stronger recovery
in industrial production in April after a weak March, HSBC said.  “Manufacturers surprised positively in April, expanding
their portfolio of new orders and increasing output and staff
levels faster than before,”  Alexander Morozov , chief economist
for Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States at HSBC in
Moscow, said in the statement. “The arrival of a late yet very
warm spring to the European part of Russia must have improved
manufacturers’ confidence.”  The Micex Index of 30 stocks advanced 0.7 percent to
1,483.73 as of 10:04 a.m. in Moscow. The ruble strengthened 0.2
percent against the dollar to 29.3410.  To contact the reporter on this story:
