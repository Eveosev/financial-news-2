Pacific Andes International Holdings
Ltd. (1174)  hired Rabobank International to coordinate a 110 million
euro ($145 million) loan, proceeds of which will help refinance
debt used for an acquisition, according to three people familiar
with the matter.  Pacific Andes last year bought a 19 percent indirect equity
interest from Icelandic Group HF in two Pickenpack Hussman &
Hahn frozen seafood processing plants in Germany and France,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The two units are the borrowers on the loan guaranteed by
Pacific Andes, one of the people said. Rabobank helped provide
the original loan for the acquisitions, another person said.
Both people asked not to be identified because the details are
private.  Pacific Andesâ€™s Singapore-listed affiliate,  Pacific Andes
Resources Development Ltd. (PAH) , signed a separate $100 million loan
on April 30, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange
 announcement . That loan was arranged by Taipei Fubon Commercial
Bank Co., one of the people said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
