Jebel Ali Free Zone FZE, a business
park operator in Dubai, will seek approval from holders of its
7.5 billion-dirham ($2 billion) Islamic bonds to redeem the
trust certificates ahead of their maturity in November.  Jebel Ali “is in advanced discussions with a group of
financial institutions in relation to a financing package,” the
company  said in a statement  to Nasdaq Dubai. “The use of
proceeds will be solely for the redemption of the certificates
ahead of the scheduled redemption date.”  Investors have been concerned about Jebel Ali Free Zone’s
ability to repay the sukuk. The state-owned company plans to
seek a $900 million syndicated loan, sell $500 million of
Islamic bonds, raise at least $200 million from the sale of its
U.K.-based Gazeley Ltd. unit and pay the remaining with its own
cash, a banker familiar with the plan said March 28.  “The trustee is proposing the introduction of a  call
option  to provide JAFZ with enhanced flexibility to implement
the new financing in a timely and efficient manner and to allow
the timing of the dissolution of the underlying trust to be
coordinated with the new financing,” the company said.  Jebel Ali Free Zone plans to repay the sukuk at par and
will redeem all the certificates, it said. A meeting of sukuk
holders will be held in  London  on May 24 and investors must turn
in their voting instructions by 4 p.m. London time on May 22.  The floating-rate Islamic notes were trading at 97.16 fils
to the dirham at 4:22 p.m. Dubai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The securities have gained 4.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
