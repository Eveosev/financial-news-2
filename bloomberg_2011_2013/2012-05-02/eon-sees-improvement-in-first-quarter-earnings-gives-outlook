EON AG (EOAN) , Germany’s biggest utility,
said it expects earnings to be about 31 percent higher in the
first quarter of 2012 from a year earlier.  Underlying net income, the profit measure EON uses to
calculate its dividend, will be around 1.7 billion euros ($2.2
billion) for the first three months of the year, compared with
1.3 billion euros in 2011, the company said in a statement
today. A cold snap in February may have helped boost gas sales,
 Baader Bank AG (BWB)  analyst Karin Brinkman said in a telephone
interview today.  “They seem to have been able to profit from that cold
week,” Brinkman said. The first quarter results “surprise me
on the upside. I had expected higher impact from the nuclear
power plant shut down.”  EON jumped as much as 1.8 percent, to 17.42 euros in
 Frankfurt  after the announcement, before trading at 17.07 euros
at 12:29 p.m. local time, down 5 cents on the day.  Full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization will be between 9.6 billion and 10.2 billion euros,
the Dusseldorf, Germany-based company said. This compares to the
10.1 billion euro median estimate of 27 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  EON has started to overhaul operations after the Fukushima
disaster in  Japan  last year drove Chancellor  Angela Merkel  to
order the permanent closing of all nuclear plants by 2022. The
shutdown of nuclear stations trimmed earnings by 2.5 billion
euros in 2011 and drove EON to announce a 15 billion-euro
divestment program, job cuts and plans to expand into new
markets including  Brazil .  The company will hold its annual shareholders meeting
tomorrow in  Essen , according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
