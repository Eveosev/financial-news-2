The U.K. government should demand that
a new European Union patent court be located in  London , U.K.
lawmakers said in a report.  Locating the Unified Patent Court in London would
“mitigate the most damaging effects of a unitary EU-wide
patent,” the U.K. Parliament’s European Scrutiny Committee said
said in a report published today. EU governments may decide on
the site of the headquarters of a proposed region-wide patent
court by the end of next month, an EU official said in February.  Attempts to reach an agreement on an EU patent system since
2000 have  faltered  over language issues and a dispute over the
location of a new court. An EU-wide patent may reduce the cost
of protecting intellectual property in the region. Companies can
pay 18,000 euros ($23,700) for a patent valid in only 13
countries, including 10,000 euros for translation, according to
the European Commission.  Last year, 25 EU nations agreed to move forward with a
common patent system. Italy and  Spain  opted out of the plans
because they objected to the language proposals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
