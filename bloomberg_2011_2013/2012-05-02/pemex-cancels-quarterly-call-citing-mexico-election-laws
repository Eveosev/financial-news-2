Petroleos Mexicanos , the state-owned
company, canceled a quarterly call with analysts and investors,
citing an election law that bans the government from promoting
achievements during a campaign.  Pemex, as the company is known, won’t have its quarterly
call after filing its earnings with the stock exchange, said a
company official for the  Mexico  City-based company who asked not
to be identified because of corporate policy.  Pemex, the largest issuer of corporate bonds in Mexico last
year, is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings today. Pemex
has posted losses in five of the past seven quarters.  This is the first time the company has canceled the call.
Pemex usually has two calls, one in Spanish and one in English,
the first business day after its quarterly filing.  “This is unusual. It raises questions about the corporate
motives behind the decision,” said  Enrique Alvarez , the head of
Latin America fixed-income research at IdeaGlobal in  New York .
“There’s a political context, but it’s hard to comprehend.”  Mexico’s finance ministry had its quarterly press
conference today after posting its budget report on April 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
