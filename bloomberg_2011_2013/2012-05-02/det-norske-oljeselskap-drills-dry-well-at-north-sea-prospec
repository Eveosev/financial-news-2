Det Norske Oljeselskap ASA (DETNOR) , the  oil
company  partly owned by Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke,
drilled a dry well at its Storebjoern prospect in the  North Sea .  “The reservoir sections were water bearing, and the well
will be plugged and abandoned,” the Trondheim, Norway-based
company said today in a statement.  It was the second dry well in the North Sea this year for
the company, which in 2011 was one of three partners in what’s
called the Johan Sverdrup deposit, the largest find offshore
Norway since 1974. That discovery may hold 3.3 billion barrels
of oil equivalent. Det Norske said in its fourth-quarter report
it plans to participate in 10 to 13 exploration wells in 2012.  Drilling took more time than expected because high-pressure
zones were encountered in the well, the company said. Det Norske
owns a 60 percent stake in the well, while Dana Petroleum Plc
has a 25 percent stake and  North Energy ASA (NORTH)  15 percent.  Det Norske’s share fell 2.1 percent to 80.5 kroner as of
11:25 a.m. in Oslo.  The benchmark OBX index gained 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
