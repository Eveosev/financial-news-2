South Africa ’s southeastern coastal
city of Durban is considering developing plants to generate
electricity from sea-currents together with Hydro Alternative
Energy Inc., which says the project would be the first of its
kind.  Hydro Alternative plans to develop a $20 million, 1
megawatt demonstration unit that will generate power from the
Agulhas Current, which flows past the city. The project is being
supported by the Durban Investment Promotion Agency.  “Generating power from from a sea current has never been
done before,” Mark Antonucci, co-chief executive officer of the
Jupiter, Florida-based company said in a phone interview today.
“All previous wave generation technologies have been tidal
based.”  South Africa is pushing the use of renewable energy to
reduce the country’s reliance on coal. The government has issued
tenders for the construction of renewable energy plants with a
capacity of 3,725 megawatts by the end of 2016.  Once the unit, which uses the so-called  Oceanus  technology,
has been tested the company can build as many plants as
required, each with a generation capacity of 8 megawatts, he
said. So far four potential sites have been identified. The
plants are submerged about 30 meters (98 feet) below  sea level 
to prevent interference with shipping.  South Africa has previously considered generating
electricity from waves. In 2006 it held talks with Edinburgh-
based Ocean Power Delivery Ltd. over a 7 billion rand ($903
million) project to develop wave-powered electricity plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
