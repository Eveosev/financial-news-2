CBS Corp. (CBS) , the broadcaster and owner
of the Showtime cable channel, will rise at least 46 percent to
more than $50 from its current price below $35, Chairman  Sumner Redstone  said.  “As long as the company continues to perform well, and it
will under Les Moonves, the stock will keep rising,” Redstone
said today in an interview with Michael Milken at the Milken
Global Institute 2012 Global Conference in Los Angeles.  CBS, run by Chief Executive Officer Moonves, reported an 80
percent increase in first-quarter profit yesterday, driven by
sales of reruns and higher fees from pay-TV systems. The shares,
which rose 2.3 percent today to $34.19, have multiplied 10-fold
from a closing low of $3.09 on March 9, 2009, during the
financial crisis.  Redstone, the 88-year-old billionaire, said his decision to
split his two New York-based media companies, CBS and  Viacom
Inc. (VIAB) , where he is also chairman, has been vindicated by Wall
Street.  Viacom, the owner of Paramount Pictures, MTV and Comedy
Central, closed today at $47.43 in  New York , up 1.8 percent. The
shares fell to a closing low of $11.96 on Nov. 20, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
