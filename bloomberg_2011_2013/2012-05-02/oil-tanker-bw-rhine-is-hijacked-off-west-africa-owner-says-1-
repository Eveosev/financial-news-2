The oil-products tanker BW Rhine was
hijacked April 28 off Togo in West Africa, the company that owns
the vessel said.  The status of the tanker, which has a capacity of 75,678
deadweight tons, isn’t known, Nick Fell, Singapore-based general
counsel for BW Maritime, said by phone today. The last contact
the company had with the ship’s crew was on April 30, he said.  The carrier was partly loaded with refined fuel and BW
Maritime has been working with local navies to locate it, he
said. The tanker sailed to West Africa from Ventspils,  Latvia ,
according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. Its depth
in the water is 12.6 meters (41 feet) out of a maximum of 14.7
meters, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
