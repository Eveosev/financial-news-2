Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , the largest U.S. cable
company, fell after reporting its 20th consecutive quarterly
decline in video subscribers following price increases.  The shares dropped 0.6 percent to $30.42 at the close.
Comcast, facing competition from phone companies and  Netflix
Inc. (NFLX) , said today it lost 37,000 video customers last quarter. At
least two analysts anticipated the first increase in cable-TV
subscribers since 2007.  Investors were “hopeful for positive net video
additions,” said  Jason Armstrong , an analyst at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. who recommends buying the shares. “That’s what
people are focused on even though Comcast has a very good story
with broadband.”  The decline in cable-TV subscribers overshadowed a gain of
439,000 high-speed Internet subscribers at Philadelphia-based
Comcast, topping the 382,000 average estimate of 11 analysts’
projections compiled by Bloomberg. Average revenue per user rose
7.8 percent to $143.40, a “standout” number, said  Marci Ryvicker , an analyst at  Wells Fargo & Co ., in an e-mail.  Comcast managed to curb video customer losses from a year
earlier, when it shed 39,000 cable-TV subscribers. It marked the
sixth consecutive quarter Comcast has reduced video losses.  Drop in Video  A rate increase for 62 percent of customers led to slightly
higher churn -- the percentage of customers who leave the
service each month -- causing a larger drop in video subscribers
than analysts estimated,  Neil Smit , Comcast’s head of cable,
said during a conference call. The average projection was a
decline of 23,000 customers.  Comcast also added a net of 164,000 phone customers, less
than the 187,000 average analyst estimate.  “Comcast is taking share from the telcos in broadband,
which in turn, with good pricing power, is leading to improved
profitability and  cash flow ,” said  Joel Levington , managing
director of corporate credit at Brookfield Investment Management
Inc. in New York.  First-quarter net income rose 30 percent to $1.22 billion,
or 45 cents a share, compared with $943 million, or 34 cents, a
year earlier, the company said in a statement. Analysts had
 projected  42 cents.  Free cash flow in the quarter increased 37 percent to a
record $3 billion.  Comcast revenue increased 23 percent to $14.9 billion,
topping estimates of $14.5 billion. NBC Universal sales rose 18
percent to $5.47 billion, helped in part by increased revenue
from Super Bowl advertising.  Broadcast television revenue rose 37 percent to $1.85
billion. Cable network revenue advanced 5.8 percent to $2.1
billion.  Comcast bought back $750 million in shares after saying it
would repurchase $3 billion in 2012 last quarter. Comcast has
gained 28 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
