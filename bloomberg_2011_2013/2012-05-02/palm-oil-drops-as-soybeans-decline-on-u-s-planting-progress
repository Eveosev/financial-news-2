Palm oil  declined for a second day,
dropping to the lowest level in more than a month, after a U.S.
government report showed that farmers accelerated soybean
planting, easing concerns about dwindling cooking-oil supplies.  The July-delivery contract fell 0.6 percent to close at
3,452 ringgit ($1,140) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the lowest settlement price for the most-active
contract since March 30.  About 12 percent of the soybean crop was planted as of
April 29 in the U.S., compared with the previous five-year
average of 5 percent, a Department of Agriculture report showed
April 30. Planting may total 73.902 million acres, down 1.4
percent from last year, the USDA said March 30. The oilseed can
be crushed to make  soybean oil , which competes with palm oil for
use in food and fuels.  “The favorable planting report shows that it’s on
schedule,” Donny Khor, senior vice president for futures and
options at  OSK Holdings Bhd. (OSK) , said by phone from Kuala Lumpur.
Increased U.S. planting will have a negative impact on palm oil
as it closely tracks the soybean market, he said.  Soybeans for July delivery fell 0.5 percent to $14.9575 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean oil for the
same month gained 0.6 percent to 55.21 cents per pound.  Palm oil has rallied 8.7 percent this year on concern
soybean crops in  South America  will decline, cutting global
cooking-oil supplies. Futures reached 3,628 ringgit a ton on
April 10, the highest level since March 2011.  ‘Improved Exports’  “This consolidation and correction phase is likely to
continue,” Khor said. “Even with the improved export numbers,
it’s not able to hold the gains.”  Malaysia’s palm oil exports rose 9.4 percent to 1.35
million tons in April compared with 1.23 million tons the
previous month, surveyor Intertek said April 30. Shipments
climbed 10.4 percent to 1.34 million tons, estimated Societe
Generale de Surveillance.  Palm oil for September delivery dropped 0.5 percent to
close at 8,730  yuan  ($1,384) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange , the lowest closing price for the most-active contract
since March 30. Soybean oil for the same month lost 0.8 percent
to close at 9,864 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
