Helsinki rejected a proposal to
establish a Guggenheim art museum in the city.  The city board voted eight to seven to block Mayor Jussi
Pajunen’s proposal to build the museum, according to a
 memorandum  posted on the Finnish capital’s website. The
memorandum didn’t provide a reason for the rejection. Passage by
the board would have sent the proposal to the city council, its
highest decision-making body.  Helsinki asked the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in
January 2011 to look into establishing its fourth European
museum in  Finland ’s biggest city. The 140 million-euro ($184
million) museum was planned as a mostly non-collecting
institution hosting traveling exhibitions of contemporary art,
with attendance estimated at about half a million people a year.  The Guggenheim Foundation has museums in  New York , Bilbao,
Berlin and Venice, and is building one in  Abu Dhabi .  To contact the reporter on this story:
