President  Barack Obama  returned from
Afghanistan today and left the White House a few hours later for
another mission: raising campaign money.  Obama was scheduled to attend two $40,000-a-plate
fundraisers at a Washington hotel to collect checks for his re-
election effort, according to a campaign official. Twenty-five
donors will be at each event, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity to discuss the closed fundraisers.  The money will go to Obama’s campaign, the  Democratic
National Committee  and state Democratic Party organizations.  Obama began the month of April with a 10-to-1 campaign cash
advantage over likely Republican nominee  Mitt Romney . The
president had $100 million in the bank at the end of March,
while the former Massachusetts governor had $10 million in cash,
according to disclosure forms filed with the  Federal Election
Commission .  Romney and Obama will forgo federal funding for the general
election. That marks the first time since public financing was
initiated after the Watergate scandal that both major party
candidates will forfeit the $91.2 million that’s available,
making them eligible to raise an unlimited amount from private
donations. Those individual donations are still subject to
limits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
