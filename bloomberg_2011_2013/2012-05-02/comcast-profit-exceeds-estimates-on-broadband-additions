Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , the largest U.S. cable
company, topped profit and sales estimates in the first quarter
after gains in broadband customers helped mitigate the 20th
consecutive loss in video subscribers.  Net income rose 30 percent to $1.22 billion, or 45 cents a
share, compared with $943 million, or 34 cents, a year earlier,
the Philadelphia-based company said today in a statement.
Analysts had  projected  42 cents.  Comcast added 439,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter,
topping the 382,000 average estimate of 11 analysts’ projections
compiled by Bloomberg. The cable provider, facing competition
from phone companies and  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , lost 37,000 video
customers. At least two analysts anticipated the first increase
in cable-TV subscribers since 2007.  “Comcast has been out-executing everybody,” said  Vijay Jayant , an analyst at ISI Group in New York who  recommends 
buying the stock. “Positive net adds on video is more of an
optical event than truly affecting the financials, but it
matters on investor sentiment.”  The cable provider fell 2 percent to $29.97 at 8 a.m.
before the markets opened. The shares had gained 29 percent this
year before today.  Comcast still managed to curb video customer losses from a
year earlier, when it shed 39,000 cable-TV subscribers. It
marked the sixth consecutive quarter Comcast has limited video
losses. Comcast raised subscriber fees for 62 percent of its
customers, leading to some cancellations and an increase in
average revenue per user, which jumped 7.8 percent to $143.40.  Comcast added a net of 164,000 phone customers, less than
the 187,000 average analyst estimate.  ‘Taking Share’  Free  cash flow  in the quarter increased 37 percent to a
record $3 billion.  “Comcast is taking share from the telcos in broadband,
which in turn, with good pricing power, is leading to improved
profitability and cash flow,” said  Joel Levington , managing
director of corporate credit at Brookfield Investment Management
Inc. in New York.  Comcast revenue increased 23 percent to $14.9 billion,
topping estimates of $14.5 billion. NBC Universal sales rose 18
percent to $5.47 billion, helped in part by increased revenue
from Super Bowl advertising.  Broadcast television revenue rose 37 percent to $1.85
billion. Cable network revenue advanced 5.8 percent to $2.1
billion.  Comcast bought back $750 million in shares after saying it
would repurchase $3 billion in 2012 last quarter.  (Comcast plans to hold a conference call at 8:30 a.m.  New
