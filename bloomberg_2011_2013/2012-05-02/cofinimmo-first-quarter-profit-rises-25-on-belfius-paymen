Cofinimmo SA,  Belgium ’s biggest real-
estate fund, reported a 25 percent increase in first-quarter
profit after receiving a one-time indemnity payment from Belfius
Bank for ending a lease on the Livingstone building.  Earnings before gains on disposals, valuation losses and
changes in the value of interest-rate derivatives rose to 2.45
euros a share from 1.96 euros a share a year earlier, the
Brussels-based company said today in an e-mailed  statement .  The occupancy rate slipped to 95.15 percent at the end of
March from 95.34 percent at the end of December, Cofinimmo said.
Net rental income climbed 25 percent from a year earlier to 58
million euros ($76.7 million) due to the 11.2 million-euro
indemnity payment from Belfius, formerly known as Dexia Bank,
for terminating the lease on the Livingstone building.  Separately,  Cofinimmo (COFB)  will give shareholders the choice of
receiving this year’s dividend in new stock, cash or a
combination of the two, the company said in a second statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
