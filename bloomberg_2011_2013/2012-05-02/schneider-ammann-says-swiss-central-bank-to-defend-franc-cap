Swiss Economy Minister Johann
Schneider-Ammann praised the franc’s cap against the euro and
predicted the central bank would defend the policy.  “I am satisfied that this limit exists,” Schneider-Ammann
told reporters today in Brussels after meetings with European
Union officials. “I am very confident and convinced that the
national bank will in fact defend the limit as it has said it
would.”  The Swiss central bank has said it’s ready to protect the
currency ceiling of 1.20 per euro as  Europe ’s fiscal crisis
clouds the region’s growth prospects, making  Switzerland ’s
economy more attractive for investors. The franc is considered a
haven in times of global turmoil.  The  Swiss National Bank  said at its quarterly assessment in
March that it expects the economy to expand about 1 percent this
year. By contrast, the European Commission projected in February
that the euro-area economy would contract this year for the
first time since 2009.  SNB President Thomas Jordan said on April 27 that policy
makers are ready to take further measures if needed to weaken
the franc as its strength poses “major challenges” to the
economy. The ceiling was introduced last September.  “It was an absolute necessity,” Schneider-Ammann said
today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
