Telenor ASA (TEL)  Chairman Harald Norvik
resigned after the Norwegian government questioned his handling
of the sale of a stake in the country’s largest commercial
television broadcaster.  Trade and Industry Minister Trond Giske “expressed a lack
of confidence” in Norvik, citing his handling of the sale of
the Fornebu, Norway-based company’s remaining stake in TV2 in
January this year, Norvik said in a statement.  A-Pressen AS, owned by Telenor and  Norway ’s LO trade union,
agreed to sell its stake in the broadcaster to Egmont
International Holding A/S, a closely held Copenhagen-based media
company and publisher, for 2.1 billion kroner ($366 million) in
January. The Norwegian government owns a 54 percent stake in
Telenor.  Giske exerted pressure on Telenor not to sell A-Pressen’s
stake as he preferred a Norwegian owner for the TV station,
Norvik said Jan. 13. Giske said that he didn’t breach policy in
raising questions about Telenor’s move to sell its holding in
the broadcaster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
