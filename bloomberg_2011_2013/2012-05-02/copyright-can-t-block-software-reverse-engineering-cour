Software companies can’t rely on
copyright rules to prevent rivals from “reverse engineering”
computer programs, the European Union’s highest court ruled.  SAS Institute Inc., the world’s biggest closely held
 software company , lost a bid at the EU Court of Justice to
extend copyright protection to the functions of a computer
program. World Programming Ltd. infringed SAS’s copyright by
developing a system that copied the company’s manuals, SAS said
at a September hearing.  “There is no copyright infringement” when a software
company without access to a program’s source code “studied,
observed and tested that program in order to reproduce its
functionality in a second program,” the court said in a
statement today.  Copyright protection doesn’t extend to the functionality of
a computer program or the programming language and the format of
a program’s data files, the EU court said.  SAS, based in Cary,  North Carolina , is an independent maker
of so-called business intelligence programs, which spot patterns
amid vast stores of data. WPL, based in Romsey,  England , makes a
software product that analyzes and processes data.  The ruling is “the European software copyright case of the
century,” said  Thomas Vinje , a spokesman for the European
Committee for Interoperable Systems, a group representing
International Business Machines Corp., Oracle Corp. and other
software developers.  Legal Certainty  “By clearly stating that functionality, programming
languages and data formats are not protected, it definitively
resolves fundamental issues that have been left unaddressed for
two decades in European copyright law,” Vinje said in an e-
mail.  While the case may aid some software developers by giving
them legal certainty over “reverse engineering,” or analyzing
concepts from rival programs to create their own products, it
will also mean that established software firms “will be at much
greater risk of upstart competitors copying functionality,”
said Guy Wilmot, a lawyer at Russell-Cooke in  London .  It’s the first time the EU’s top court has been asked to
define the scope of copyright protection for computer software.
The  High Court  in London in 2010  referred the case  to the EU
tribunal for guidance on how to interpret the region’s  software 
and  copyright  laws. The court will decide whether SAS can claim
copyright over manuals copied by WPL.  Copyright is “a somewhat ill-fitted tool in the fight
against copycats,” said Tom De Cordier, a lawyer at  Allen &
Overy  in Brussels. “For a competing piece of software to
constitute a copyright infringement, it will in most cases be
required” that code is copied from the original computer
program.  Pamela Meek, a spokeswoman for SAS, declined to immediately
comment. WPL didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  The case is:  C-406/10 , SAS Institute Inc. v. World
Programming Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
