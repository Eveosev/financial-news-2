Chile ’s peso was little changed as
trading resumed from yesterday’s public holiday after weaker
manufacturing in the euro region countered expansion in the U.S.  The currency traded at 485.05 per  U.S. dollar  as of 11:09
a.m. in Santiago from 485.05 on April 30 and earlier weakened as
much as 0.3 percent to 486.45. Chilean  interest-rate swaps  fell
to the lowest in eight weeks as copper, the nation’s biggest
export, led a slump in metals prices.  Manufacturing in the euro area fell and unemployment
reached a 15-year high, fanning concern that the region’s
economic slump may deepen. Data published yesterday, when
Chilean markets were closed, showed manufacturing in the U.S.
grew at the fastest pace in almost a year last month.  “Yesterday markets reacted positively to the U.S. data and
today they have turned negative in response to news from
 Europe ,” said Alejandro Araya, a currency trader at Banco
Santander Chile in Santiago. “Yesterday’s data is offsetting
today’s.”  Chile’s two-year interest-rate swap rate dropped six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 5.15 percent. The one-year
swap rate fell seven basis points to 5.13 percent.  Copper, which accounts for more than half of Chile’s
exports, declined as much as 2 percent to $3.7665 a pound on the
Comex in  New York  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
