Treasury 10-year yields approached the
lowest level in almost three months as manufacturing contracted
in  Europe  and private employers in the U.S. added fewer workers
than forecast, underpinning demand for the safest assets.  The Treasury, in its quarterly refunding announcement,
delayed decisions on whether to sell floating-rate securities
and bills with negative yields at government auctions for the
first time. The U.S. will issue $32 billion in three-year notes,
$24 billion in 10-year debt and $16 billion in 30-year bonds on
three consecutive days beginning May 8, the same amounts sold in
each so-called refunding month since November 2010.  “With all the data, we’ve definitely hit a bump in the
road,” said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist in New
York at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, one of 21 primary dealers that
trade with the  Federal Reserve . “We caught the bid overnight,”
he said, as Treasuries rallied along with German government
debt.  The 10-year note  yield  fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.93 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
security due in February 2022 gained 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000
face amount, to 100 5/8. The yield dropped to 1.88 percent on
April 27, the lowest level since Feb. 3.  Companies in the U.S. added 119,000 workers in April,
according to figures from Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP
Employer Services. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a 170,000 advance. Estimates of the 37
economists ranged from gains of 100,000 to 200,000.  Floating-Rate Notes  The Treasury said it sees benefits in the issuance of
floating-rate notes and a decision will be made “at a later
date.” While there are good reasons to have negative yields at
Treasury auctions, a department official said, no decision has
been made and there are operational challenges.  Maturing Treasuries available for reinvestment will total
$36.7 billion, and the sales will raise $35.3 billion of new
cash, estimates Wrightson ICAP LLC, an economic advisory company
in  Jersey City ,  New Jersey .  A euro-region  factory gauge  based on a survey of  purchasing
managers  slipped to a 34-month low of 45.9 from 47.7 in March,
London-based Markit Economics said. A reading below 50 indicates
contraction. German unemployment increased by a seasonally
adjusted 19,000 to 2.87 million, the Nuremberg-based Federal
Labor Agency said. Economists forecast a decline of 10,000.  ‘Soft Data’  “The soft data is starting to pile up,” James Collins, an
interest-rate strategist in the futures group in  Chicago  at
Citigroup Global Markets Inc., a primary dealer. “We’re skewed
toward lower yields.”  Yields on German two-year debt fell as low as 0.066 percent
while  10-year bunds  declined as low as to 1.60 percent, both
record lows.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said April 25 the central bank
is ready to add to its stimulus if necessary, even after it
upgraded its view of the economy.  Treasuries handed investors a return of 9.8 percent last
year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, as
financial turmoil in the euro-region boosted demand for the
safest assets. The securities are little changed this year.  HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said  China ’s
Purchasing Managers’ Index for April advanced to 49.3 from a
preliminary 49.1 reported on April 23 and a final 48.3 the
previous month. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  Payrolls increased by 161,000 last month after a 120,000
gain in March, a Bloomberg survey showed before the Labor
Department announces the figures on May 4.  ‘Not Sustainable’  “We all know from listening to Bernanke that payrolls over
the next several months are really what they’re focused on when
it relates to quantitative easing,” said Tom Tucci, managing
director and head of Treasury trading in  New York  at CIBC World
Markets Corp. “The recovery’s not sustainable on its own. It
needs further accommodation.”  U.S. policy makers have pledged to keep the benchmark
target for overnight bank lending at almost zero until at least
late 2014. The central bank has also  purchased  $2.3 trillion of
debt in two rounds of quantitative easing, or QE, to lower
borrowing costs.  John Williams , president of the San Francisco Fed, joined
his counterparts from Richmond, Philadelphia and Atlanta
yesterday in casting doubt on the need for additional purchases
of bonds to push down longer-term  interest rates . Three of them
are voting members of the  Federal Open Market Committee , which
sets interest rates.  ‘Further Progress’  Thresholds for further action “would be if we see economic
growth slow to the point where we’re not seeing further progress
in bringing the  unemployment rate  down,” Williams said at a
conference in  Beverly Hills ,  California . Those aren’t “the
circumstances I currently expect,” he said.  The Fed sold $1.34 billion of Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities maturing from January 2014 to April 2015 today as
part of its program to replace $400 billion of short-term debt
in its portfolio with longer-term securities in an effort to
reduce borrowing costs further and counter rising risks of a
recession.  To contact the reporters on this story:
