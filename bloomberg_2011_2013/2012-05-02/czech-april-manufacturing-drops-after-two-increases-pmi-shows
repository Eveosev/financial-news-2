Czech manufacturing shrank in April,
after two months of expansion, as new export business declined
for a sixth month, an industry gauge showed.  The HSBC Czech Republic Manufacturing PMI fell to 49.7 from
52.1 in March, the bank said today in an e-mailed report. A
result greater than 50 signals improvement in manufacturing
performance.  “Driving the overall weakening in the business climate in
April was a fall in the volume of new work received,” the bank
said in the report, compiled by Markit, a financial information
services company. “New export orders fell for the sixth
successive month.”  Czech economic  growth  depends on demand for its products
from the European Union, which buys about 80 percent of the
country’s exports with Germany accounting for a third. The
economy returned to a recession in the second half of last year
as government spending cuts outweighed demand abroad for Czech-
made vehicles, car parts and electronics goods.  To contact the reporter on this story:
