Spirent Communications Plc (SPT) , a U.K.
maker of telecommunications testing systems, rose to the highest
in 10 years in  London  trading after saying first-quarter results
beat its forecasts.  Revenue increased 5.4 percent from a year earlier to $129.4
million, the Crawley, southern-England based company said in a
statement today. Sales at its Performance Analysis unit jumped
16 percent to $107.3 million.  “Performance analysis is going gangbusters,” Panmure
Gordon & Co. analyst George O’Connor, who has a buy rating on
the stock, said in a note to clients today. “While the short
term remains uncertain, structurally, the world is in a better
place for Spirent than it was a few short months ago.”  Spirent paid $40 million last month for California-based Mu
Dynamics, its biggest acquisition since 2006 and only the second
since that year. Mu Dynamics does testing for cloud computing
and  cyber security .  Spirent is focusing on growth markets such as mobile
internet, cloud computing and global positioning systems. The
company said its performance analysis unit is also benefiting
from its strong position in Asia-Pacific.  “All of these drivers are very positive for Spirent’s
future and will support our continued growth through 2012,” it
said in the statement.  Service Assurance  The stock rose as much as 4.3 percent to 176.3 pence, the
most since January 2002. It was up 1.3 pence, or 0.8 percent, at
170.3 pence at 10:45 a.m. in London, extending its gain so far
this year to 44 percent.  “We have seen Performance Analysis outperforming once
again and there is swift action being taken on Service
Assurance,” said  Lee Simpson , an analyst at Jefferies
International Ltd. in London, in a phone interview. “These are
the positives for investors to take away from this.”  Spirent has outpaced all of its competitors on the FTSE 350
Technology Hardware and Equipment Index this year. Laird Plc has
advanced 39 percent and CSR plc has jumped 22 percent. Arm
Holdings Plc has declined 13 percent.  Operating  profit  rose 15 percent in the first quarter to
$27.2 million and adjusted basic earnings per share increased 15
percent to 3.03 cents from 2.63 cents a year earlier.  The results were a “big beat” to Panmure’s estimates,
O’Connor said.  Revenue and operating profit in Spirent’s service assurance
and systems units declined in the period as customers deferred
orders and demand for consumer wheelchairs fell.
