Lion Capital  LLP plans to fund its bid
for French eyeglass retailer Alain Afflelou SA with about 410
million euros ($540 million) of debt, according to two people
with knowledge of the situation.  The financing will include a 110 million-euro eight-year
mezzanine facility that also offers warrants in Alain Afflelou,
and about 300 million euros of senior debt, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the deal is private.  Shona Prendergast, a spokesman in  London  for Lion Capital,
declined to comment on details of the debt financing.  Lion Capital said on April 30 it entered into exclusive
talks to buy Alain Afflelou from Bridgepoint, Apax Partners
France and  Altamir Amboise. (LTA)  Lion Capital last week offered about
800 million euros for the assets, another person with knowledge
of the matter said on April 30. The buyout is set to be Franceâ€™s
largest private equity deal so far this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Citigroup Inc.,  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and Alcentra Ltd. provided
debt financing for the deal, Lion Capital said.  Bridgepoint, a buyout fund manager based in London, bought
a majority stake in Alain Afflelou in 2006, when its eponymous
founder sought to plan his succession. The deal valued the
company at about 500 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
