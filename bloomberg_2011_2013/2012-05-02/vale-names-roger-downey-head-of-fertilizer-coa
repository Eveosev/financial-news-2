Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s second-largest
mining company, named  Roger Downey  as head of its fertilizers
and coal business in the fourth replacement of a top executive
in less than six months.  Downey, a former chief executive officer of billionaire
Eike Batista’s iron-ore producer  MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA (MMXM3) ,
replaces Eduardo Bartolomeo, the Rio de Janeiro-based company
said in a  statement  today, without elaborating.  Chief Executive Officer Murilo Ferreira reshuffled the
company’s management in November, replacing three executive
directors. Bartolomeo, who at the time was leading Vale’s
integrated bulk operations, was then named executive director
for Fertilizers and Coal.  Downey will oversee the $5.9 billion Rio Colorado potash
project in the Argentine province of Mendoza, which Vale is
reviewing. Ferreira announced the revision on an April 26
conference call, saying the company is “very concerned” about
the political situation in the neighboring country. Argentina
seized oil producer  YPF SA (YPFD)  on April 16.  A former director of equity research at Credit Suisse Group
AG, Downey was CEO of Rio-based MMX until October, when he
resigned citing personal reasons. He had a previous stint at
Vale in 2005 as manager for strategic marketing of iron ore.  Vale  rose  0.8 percent to 41.80 reais at the close in Sao
Paulo. The stock has gained about 11 percent this year, compared
with the 10 percent increase in the Brazilian benchmark Bovespa
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
