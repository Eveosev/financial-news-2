Amar’e Stoudemire said there’s a
“great chance” he’ll be able to play in Game 4 of the  New York
Knicks ’ playoff series against the  Miami Heat  after having
surgery on his cut hand.  Stoudemire, 29, was injured when he punched a metal and
glass box holding the extinguisher at Miami’s AmericanAirlines
Arena three days ago after the Knicks fell behind 2-0 in the
best-of-seven National Basketball Association series.  The Knicks’ second-leading scorer, Stoudemire had a small
muscle in his hand surgically repaired May 1, when the team
confirmed he’ll miss Game 3 tonight in New York and said he was
doubtful for the fourth game on May 6. Stoudemire yesterday met
with reporters for the first time since the incident.  “I’m going to stay strong and stay positive,” Stoudemire
told reporters, in comments broadcast on ESPN. “I think there’s
a great chance I’ll be able to play on Sunday.”  The 6-foot-10 Stoudemire averaged 17.5 points and 7.8
rebounds in 47 games for the Knicks this season. It was his
lowest scoring average since his rookie year of 2002-03 in
Phoenix. He missed 19 games earlier this season because of a
bulging disc in his back and the death of his brother.  The Knicks have tied an NBA record with 12 straight playoff
losses dating to the 2000-01 postseason.  To contact the reporter on this story:
