Playtech Ltd. (PTEC)  Chief Executive Officer
Mor Weizer says  Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s share sale on the stock exchange
will boost social gaming and the company remains highly
acquisitive.  “We remain highly acquisitive,” Weizer said in a phone
interview today. “We see some opportunities, given that the
market is undergoing regulatory change. I see reports that
Facebook may be floating in mid-May that will give a boost to
social gaming.”  Weizer added that he expects the U.S. make a “lot of
progress” this year toward regulating gambling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
