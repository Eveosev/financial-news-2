Chile’s government announced plans to
increase  unemployment benefits , a week after Finance Minister
Felipe Larrain said the economy of the world’s top copper
producing nation was operating at near full employment.  Workers who had contracts for an indefinite term will be
able to draw 70 percent of their monthly salary in the first
month after losing their job rather than today’s 50 percent,
President Sebastian Pinera said in a speech televised live on
state television. The benefits are part of an insurance system
financed by workers, employers and the government.  Pinera said changes in part will be funded by redirecting
contributions from a general unemployment account to the
workers’ personal account. Larrain said Chile was nearing rates
of full unemployment on April 25, before adding that the economy
would shed jobs after the end of summer in February.  “This is good news for the freer, more equitable  Chile  we
all believe in,” said Pinera, a Harvard University-trained
economist. “This will give workers more peace-of-mind, more
security and improved chances to find another job.”  Chile’s unemployment rate  increased to 6.6 percent in the
three months through March from 6.4 percent through February as
the farm and retail industries shed jobs at the end of the
southern hemisphere’s summer, Larrain told reporters in Santiago
April 30. Unemployment was 7.3 percent in March 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
