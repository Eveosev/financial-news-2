Natural gas futures in  New York 
declined the most in almost two months on forecasts of
moderating weather that may limit demand from  power plants .  Gas slid 5 percent after WSI Corp. in Andover,
 Massachusetts , predicted mostly normal weather in the Midwest
and Northeast through May 16. About 35 percent of U.S. gas
demand comes from electricity producers, according to the Energy
Department.  “The bullish weather has dissipated, and we’re still on a
path toward lower prices,” said Tom Saal, senior vice president
of energy trading at INTL Hencorp Futures LLC in Miami. “We
could take another shot at $2.”  Natural gas for June delivery fell 11.8 cents to settle at
$2.253 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures have declined 25 percent this
year, making gas the worst performer on the Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Index of 24 commodities. Today’s percentage drop was the
biggest since March 5.  Gas fell to a 10-year intraday low of $1.902 per million
Btu on April 19.  June $2 puts, bets that prices will fall, were the most
active options in electronic trading on the exchange. They rose
1.6 cents to 3.4 cents per million Btu on volume of 1,223
contracts at 3:05 p.m.  The high in New York on May 9 may be 71 degrees Fahrenheit
(22 Celsius), 2 above normal, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in
 State College ,  Pennsylvania . The high in  Cleveland  may be 63
degrees, 2 below normal.  Cooling demand in the U.S. may be 7 percent below normal
from May 8 through May 12, data from Weather Derivatives in
Belton,  Missouri , show.  Summer Outlook  Temperatures in the U.S. this summer will be lower than the
past two years and the number of hurricanes coming out of the
Atlantic will probably be fewer than in 2011, forecasters from
MDA EarthSat Weather said.  While June to August may be warmer than both the 10-year
and 30-year averages, temperatures aren’t forecast to reach the
record hot levels of 2011, Travis Hartman, energy weather
manager at  MDA  in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said in a joint
presentation by MDA and Bloomberg LP in New York yesterday.  Residential deliveries of natural gas in February totaled
23 billion cubic feet a day, the lowest on record for that
month, the Energy Department said April 30 in its Natural Gas
Monthly report. Commercial deliveries were 13.5 billion a day,
the lowest for that month since 1992.  Supply Report  Gas inventories rose 47 billion cubic feet in the week
ended April 20 to 2.548 trillion cubic feet, the Energy
Department said April 26. Marketed gas production reached a
record 66.22 billion in 2011 and may rise another 4.5 percent
this year, according to Energy Department estimates.  “The inventory glut could still drive prices to new lows
this spring as seasonal weather demand fades,” said  Mike Fitzpatrick , editor of the Energy OverView newsletter in New
York, in a note to clients. “More pressure is likely to come in
summer as storage caverns fill up and force more gas on to an
oversupplied market.”  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  reported an unexpected first-
quarter loss, cut cash flow estimates, reduced its drilling
budget and said it may run out of money next year under the
weight of the lowest natural-gas prices in a decade.  The company’s net loss narrowed to $71 million, or 11 cents
a share, from $205 million, or 32 cents, a year earlier, the
Oklahoma City-based company said in a statement yesterday.
Natural-gas production of 2.98 billion cubic feet a day was 10
percent higher than a year earlier.  Chesapeake Production  Chesapeake curtailed gross natural gas production by about
330 million cubic feet a day during the first quarter and by as
much as 900 million a day in February and March, the company
said in an earnings statement yesterday.  The company will reduce its gas-rig count to 12 within the
next 90 days from 50 at the beginning of 2012,  Aubrey McClendon ,
Chesapeake’s chief executive officer, said in a conference call
with analysts today.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
366,449 as of 2:46 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 371,000. Volume was 394,768 yesterday. Open interest was 1.26
million contracts. The three-month average is 1.25 million.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
