Germany ’s bonds rose, driving the
nation’s borrowing costs to record lows, on speculation  Europe ’s
economic slump is deepening and exacerbating the region’s
financial crisis.  Yields on German two-, five-, 10- and 30-year securities
fell to lowest since Bloomberg began tracking the securities
after unemployment in the euro area rose in March and
manufacturing shrank for a ninth month in April, stoking demand
for the safest assets. Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds fell as
the region’s debt markets reopened after a holiday yesterday.
 Portugal ’s notes gained as the nation auctioned 1.5 billion
euros ($1.97 billion) of bills.  “Bunds have been trading at low levels for a while and all
they required was the miserable  Purchasing Managers ’ Index
numbers to take them to fresh lows,” said  Marc Ostwald , a
fixed-income strategist at Monument Securities Ltd. in London,
referring to yields. “For those investors that have to have a
proportion of their portfolios invested in euros, there are few
other options.”  The  10-year bund  yield fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.61 percent at 4:46 p.m. London after
dropping to a record 1.599 percent. The 1.75 percent security
due in July 2022 rose 0.465, or 4.65 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 101.265.  Two-year yields dropped to as low as 0.066 percent,  five-
year  rates reached 0.549 percent and 30-year yields slid to
2.325 percent. Bund futures climbed to an all-time high of
141.839.  Finland ’s 10-year bond yield also dropped to 1.998
percent, the least on record.  Factory Output  The euro-area  factory gauge  based on a survey of purchasing
managers slipped to 45.9 from 47.7 in March, London-based Markit
Economics said. That’s the lowest in 34 months and compares with
an estimate of 46 published on April 23. A reading below 50
indicates contraction. An Italian manufacturing index tumbled to
43.8 from 47.9. German, Spanish and French factory indexes also
showed a contraction.  “The sharp fall in Italian PMI and continued downward
trend in Spanish, French and German PMI is the main driver of
the selloff in Spanish debt,” said  Brian Barry , an analyst at
Investec Bank Plc in  London . That underscores “the fragility of
the underlying fundamentals,” he said.  Spain ’s 10-year  yield  rose eight basis points to 5.85
percent and similar-maturity Italian yields climbed one basis
point to 5.55 percent.  Volatility on Spanish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by Swedish securities, according to
measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and
credit-default swaps. The change in the Spanish spread was 3.5
times the 90-day average.  Unemployment Rises  Italy’s unemployment rate jumped more than economists
forecast in March to the highest since 2000. Joblessness
increased to a seasonally adjusted 9.8 percent from a revised
9.6 percent in February. The rate for the 17-nation euro area
climbed to 10.9 percent from 10.8 percent.  German unemployment unexpectedly rose in April, with the
number of people out of work increasing a seasonally adjusted
19,000 to 2.87 million, the Nuremberg-based Federal Labor Agency
said today.  European  stocks  dropped and the euro weakened for a third
day against the dollar.  The  European Central Bank  meets tomorrow in Barcelona to
review monetary policy, with all 58 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey predicting it will keep the benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at a record-low 1 percent.  Portuguese Notes  Portugal’s notes gained as the nation sold six- and 12-
month bills. The two-year yield declined 34 basis points to 8.24
percent after falling to 8.22 percent, the lowest level since
March 2011.  The  10-year bond  yield fell four basis points to 10.59
percent. The extra yield investors demand to hold the securities
instead of similar-maturity German bunds still increased four
basis points to 898 basis points.  “The crisis certainly added, temporarily, to the demand
for bunds and has strengthened the nature of German credit,”
said Carl Heinz Daube, managing director of Germany’s Federal
Finance Agency in  Frankfurt .  Too Wide  The spread of Portuguese bonds over bunds is too wide
because it implies investors will have to write down almost half
of their holdings, according to ING Bank NV.  The difference should be around 600 basis points, implying
a 30 percent writedown, Alessandro Giansanti, a senior rates
strategist at ING in Amsterdam, said today by telephone.  Greece ’s debt rating was lifted out of the default category
by  Standard & Poor’s  after the country completed the largest
debt restructuring in history. The long-term sovereign rating
was raised to CCC from SD, or selective default, with a stable
outlook, the ratings company said today.  The Greek  10-year yield  rose 26 basis points to 20.43
percent. It surged to a record 44.21 percent on March 9 before
the debt exchange.  German debt returned 1.1 percent last month, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities were the worst
performers in April of the 26 sovereign markets tracked by the
indexes, falling 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
