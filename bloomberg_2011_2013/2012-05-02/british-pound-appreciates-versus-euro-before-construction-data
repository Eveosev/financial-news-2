The pound strengthened the most in
more than a week against the euro after U.K. reports showed
construction output slowed less in April than economists
forecast and  mortgage approvals  unexpectedly rose in March.  Sterling climbed to a 22-month high versus the shared
currency after data showed euro-area manufacturing contracted
and unemployment increased, adding to concern  Europe ’s debt
crisis is worsening. The pound slipped from near an eight-month
high against the dollar. Gilts rose for a third day.  “The pound is being driven by external factors as well as
slightly better data” from the U.K., said  Steven Saywell , head
of foreign-exchange strategy for Europe at BNP Paribas SA in
 London . “We are starting to see sterling outperformance as a
theme in the market.”  The pound appreciated 0.5 percent to 81.22 pence per euro
at 4:40 p.m. London time after rising 0.6 percent, the biggest
gain since April 23. It reached 81.13 pence, the strongest since
June 2010. Sterling fell 0.1 percent to $1.6199 after climbing
to $1.6302 on April 30.  A gauge of U.K.  building activity  based on a survey of
 purchasing managers  dropped to 55.8 from 56.7 in March, Markit
Economics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply 
said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a decline to
54. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. Lenders granted
49,860 loans to buy homes, up from 49,029 in February, the Bank
of  England  said.  Factory Gauge  The euro-area factory gauge slipped to a 34-month low of
45.9 from 47.7 in March, Markit also said. A separate European
report showed unemployment was at a 15-year high.  BNP predicts sterling will appreciate to 80 pence per euro
in the second half of the year, Saywell said. The U.K currency
may strengthen to $1.75 in the same period, he said.  “That’s a very bullish view, based largely on the dollar
remaining weak, driven by a very easy U.S. policy, and the
market pricing in some policy normalization by the  Bank of
England ,” he said.  The pound has risen 3 percent in the past three months, the
best performer of the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar rose 0.3
percent, and the euro climbed 0.4 percent.  The  10-year gilt  yield fell five basis points to 2.05
percent after dropping to 2.04 percent, the lowest since April
16. The 4 percent bond due March 2022 rose 0.46, or 4.60 pounds
per 1,000-pound face amount, to 117.295.  BOE Meeting  Bank of England officials will consider whether to extend
their asset-purchase program when they meet on May 9-10. The
Monetary Policy Committee backed finishing the current 325
billion-pound round plan when it last met on April 4-5.  The Debt Management Office plans to auction 1.2 billion
pounds of inflation-linked securities due March 2034 tomorrow.  Gilts have handed investors a loss of 1.2 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Treasuries
were little changed, and German bunds gained 1.4 percent.  Gilt futures expiring in June may test their record high
should they remain above a level of so-called support, according
to UBS AG, citing trading patterns.  “Gilts are bullish while they trade above the 115.08
low,”  Richard Adcock , head of fixed-income technical strategy
at UBS in London, wrote today in a note to clients. That
represents the April 25 intraday low, Adcock wrote.  A break beyond 116.24 will pave the way to the April 10
high of 116.74, he said. Support refers to an area where buy
orders may be clustered.  The June contract rose 0.4 percent to 116.37.  To contact the reporter on this story:
