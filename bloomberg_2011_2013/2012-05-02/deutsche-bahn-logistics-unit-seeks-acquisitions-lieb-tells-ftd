 Deutsche Bahn AG’s DB Schenker
Logistics unit may make acquisitions in  emerging markets  or some
European countries, Thomas Lieb, the head of the unit said in an
interview in the Financial Times Deutschland.  The unit would consider purchases in England,  Italy  or a
northern European country as it aims to double its revenue by
2020, the newspaper said, citing Lieb. The freight business of
Deutsche Bahn AG makes up 40 percent of the company’s revenue
and is leader in the European overland transportation market,
the FTD said, citing Lieb.  To contact the reporter on this story:
