The won rose to a four-week high after
reports showed manufacturing in the U.S. and  China  grew at the
fastest pace in at least 10 months, brightening the outlook for
 South Korea ’s exports.  Government bonds  declined.  The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s factory index
climbed to 54.8 in April, exceeding the most optimistic forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey, while China’s  Purchasing Managers ’
Index signaled a fifth month of growth, figures showed
yesterday. South Korea’s overseas shipments contracted for a
second month in April, affected by fewer working days due to a
parliamentary election, government data showed. The  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index
of shares rose the most in two weeks.  “With the U.S. and Chinese manufacturing data, the overall
atmosphere is favorable for the won,” said Lee Yong Hee, a
Seoul-based currency dealer at Industrial Bank of  Korea . “We
see more exporters selling the dollar than importers buying,
which also supports the won.”  The won gained 0.2 percent from its April 30 close to
1,127.45 per dollar in Seoul, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 1,125.35 earlier, the strongest level
since April 3. The Kospi rose 0.9 percent. South Korea’s local
financial markets were closed yesterday for a holiday. One-month
implied volatility for the won, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, declined one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, since April 30 to 7.00 percent.  Slowing Inflation  South Korea will carry out policy measures that will
encourage a private sector-led economic recovery and allow the
country to cope with external risks for the rest of this year,
the  Finance Ministry  said in a statement yesterday. Inflation
slowed to a 21-month low of 2.5 percent last month, less than
the median forecast for a 2.8 percent rate in a Bloomberg News
survey, government data showed yesterday.  A separate output index for China rose in April, today’s
figures showed. HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics reported
its purchasing managers’ index of Chinese factory production
rose to 49.3 in April, compared with a preliminary reading of
49.1 on April 23 and a final 48.3 in March.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 climbed one basis point to 3.46 percent, Korea Exchange
Inc. prices show. Three-year debt futures fell 0.05 to 104.19
and the one-year interest-rate swap held steady at 3.49 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
