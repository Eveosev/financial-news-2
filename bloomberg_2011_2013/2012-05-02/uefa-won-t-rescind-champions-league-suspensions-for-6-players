Three players each from  Bayern Munich 
and Chelsea will miss the Champions League soccer final after an
appeal of their suspensions was rejected.  Bayern’s David Alaba, Holger Badstuber and Luis Gustavo,
and Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic, Raul Meireles and Ramires must
sit out the May 19 title match in Munich after picking up their
third yellow cards of the competition during the semifinal
round. Players union FIFPro appealed the bans to European
soccer’s governing body UEFA.  “UEFA said it will not respond to the appeal for clemency
for the six players, who will have to miss the coming Champions
League final because they were awarded a yellow card in the
second match of their semifinal,” FIFPro said in a  statement  on
its website. “In fact,  UEFA  states the rule will stay in force
for the coming three years.”  UEFA wipes out all yellow cards awarded to players after
the European Championships and world governing body FIFA does
the same for the World Cup.  “Different rules can apply in different competitions,”
Michael  van Praag , head of UEFA’s Champions League rules groups,
said on FIFPro’s website. “The current rules are a result of a
careful, democratic procedure.”  Van Praag added that UEFA “did not receive any request
whatsoever concerning the yellow-card rule, not even from the
representative of Bayern Munich” during the meeting in which
the rule was extended.  Chelsea captain  John Terry  will also miss the final after
receiving a red card in the second semifinal game against
Barcelona.  To contact the reporter on this story:
