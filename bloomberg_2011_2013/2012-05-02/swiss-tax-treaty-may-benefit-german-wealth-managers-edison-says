German wealth managers may benefit
from a withholding tax deal with  Switzerland  as affluent Germans
repatriate funds from the Alpine country, according to Edison
Investment Research.  German holdings in Switzerland probably rose to about 222
billion euros ($291.8 billion) at the end of 2010 from 187
billion euros at the end of 2007,  Peter Thorne  and other
analysts at Edison wrote in a note to be published tomorrow.
About 41 percent of those funds were declared, they said.  Switzerland and Germany signed an amended withholding-tax
accord last month to end a dispute over  tax evasion  between the
neighboring countries. The Swiss financial industry, with the
exception of some “very small” private banks and asset
managers, should digest repatriation of German funds as they
represent 12 percent of non-resident money in Switzerland,
according to Edison.  The number of Germans declaring their funds fell to 27,496
in 2010 from 56,566 in 2007, which probably “reflects the
repatriation of money to  Germany  rather than the decision by
Germans not to declare their earnings,” Edison said.  German wealth managers will probably also profit from
demand for investment products as the country’s population ages
and seeks alternatives to state pensions, according to Edison.  To contact the reporter on this story:
