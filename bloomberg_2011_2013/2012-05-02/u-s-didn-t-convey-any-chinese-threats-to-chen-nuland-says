No U.S. official passed on information
about any physical or legal threats from Chinese authorities to
dissident  Chen Guangcheng , State Department spokeswoman  Victoria Nuland  said in a statement.  “Nor did Chinese officials make any such threats to us,”
Nuland said.  U.S. interlocutors did make clear that if Chen elected to
stay in the U.S. embassy in Beijing, where he sought refuge,
Chinese officials had indicated that his family would be
returned to Shandong and they would lose their opportunity to
negotiate for reunification, she said.  “At no point during his time at the embassy did Chen ever
request political asylum in the U.S.,” she said. “At every
opportunity, he expressed his desire to stay in  China , reunify
with his family, continue his education and work for reform in
his country. All our diplomacy was directed at putting him in
the best possible position to achieve his objectives.”  The  Associated Press  reported that Chen said by phone that
he now wants to leave China with his family. Chen said a U.S.
official relayed a threat by Chinese authorities to beat his
wife to death if he stayed in the U.S. embassy, according to the
AP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
