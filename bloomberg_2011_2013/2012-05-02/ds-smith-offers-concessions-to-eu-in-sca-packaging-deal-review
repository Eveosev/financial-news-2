DS Smith Plc (SMDS)  offered concessions to
European Union regulators examining its plan to buy  Svenska
Cellulosa AB (SCAA) ’s packaging business for 1.6 billion euros ($2.1
billion) as it vies with Smurfit Kappa Group Plc to become the
region’s largest supplier of recycled cartons for  consumer
goods .  The European Commission extended its deadline to rule on
the deal until May 25 to examine the concessions, it said in a
filing on its website today. It didn’t specify the offered
remedies.  Chief Executive Officer Miles Roberts, who joined DS Smith
in May 2010, is buying the SCA unit to gain access to new
geographical markets across Europe and “substantially” improve
earnings per share, the U.K. company said in January.  DS Smith declined to comment on the concessions. Roberts
has said he expects the SCA acquisition to be completed by the
end of June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
