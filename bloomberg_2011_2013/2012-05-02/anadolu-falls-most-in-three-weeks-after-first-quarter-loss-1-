Anadolu Anonim Turk Sigorta Sirketi (ANSGR) ,
Turkeyâ€™s non-life insurer, dropped the most in more than three
weeks after reporting a first-quarter loss of 7.81 million liras
($4.4 million).  Anadolu Sigorta fell 2.2 percent to 90 kurus at the close
in Istanbul, the biggest decline since April 10.  The loss in the first three months of this year compared
with a profit of 4.51 million liras a year ago, Anadolu Sigorta
said in a filing with the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  after the end
of trading on April 30. Turkish markets were closed for the
Labor Day holiday yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
