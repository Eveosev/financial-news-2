First Bank of Nigeria Plc (FIRSTBAN) , the West
African nation’s third-largest lender by market value, said
first-quarter profit doubled as revenue jumped 42 percent.  Net income rose to 24.5 billion naira ($155.7 million) in
the three months through March from 12.2 billion naira a year
earlier, the Lagos-based lender said in a statement today on the
website of the  Nigerian Stock Exchange . Revenue climbed to 92.3
billion naira from 64.8 billion naira.  “A good set of numbers which follows the general trend
that has been prevalent to date,” Securities Africa, a
Johannesburg-based brokerage, wrote in an e-mailed note to
clients today.  First Bank, which in October agreed to buy Congo’s Banque
Internationale de Credit, is looking to acquire another lender
this year in West Africa, Chief Financial Officer Adebayo Adelabu said April 18. It also wants to add 120 branches in
 Nigeria  to a total of 750, he said.  The bank’s loans and advances increased 12 percent to 1.89
trillion naira, compared with a year earlier, it said. Deposits
climbed 8 percent to 2.29 trillion naira.  First Bank’s  shares  jumped 4.9 percent to 10.47 naira at
the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, the commercial capital. The  stock 
has gained 18 percent this year, compared with the 21 rise of
the  Bloomberg NSE Banking Index (NGSEB10) , which tracks the performance of
Nigeria’s 10 biggest banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
