 South African farmers probably
harvested 33 percent more wheat in the 2011 season than a year
earlier, a survey showed.  The government may say growers reaped 1.9 million metric
tons of the grain, the median of seven traders surveyed by
Bloomberg News shows. That compares with 1.43 million tons
produced a year earlier and with the Crop Estimates Committee’s
final forecast of 1.91 million tons, released on Feb. 28. The
committee is set to report output on May. 8.  South Africa , which is a net importer of wheat, is sub-
Saharan  Africa ’s largest producer of the grain and the region’s
third-biggest importer after Nigeria and  Sudan , according to
U.S. Department of Agriculture data on Bloomberg.  Wheat prices have declined 14 percent over the past year on
the Johannesburg-based South African Futures Exchange. Prices
for the May contract increased 1.7 percent to 2,686 rand ($346)
by the midday close.  To contact the reporters on this story:
