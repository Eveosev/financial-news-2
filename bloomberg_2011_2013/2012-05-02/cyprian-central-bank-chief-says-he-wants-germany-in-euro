Panicos Demetriades, the new governor
of the Cyprian central bank, has reversed his earlier statement
that the  euro  crisis could be solved by  Germany  exiting the
single currency, the Financial Times Deutschland reported.  In a letter to the Financial Times published in May 2011,
Demetriades called upon Germany to ditch the euro.  ”As an independent academic, I decided to make a
lighthearted response to those who demanded that the weaker euro
area members leave the euro area,” Demetriades told the FTD
yesterday. ”I am wholly committed to the euro project and want
the euro area to be strengthened.”  Demetriades will be sworn in as Cypriot central bank
governor tomorrow. He will not participate in this week’s
meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council, which is made up of the
heads of the euro region’s central banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
