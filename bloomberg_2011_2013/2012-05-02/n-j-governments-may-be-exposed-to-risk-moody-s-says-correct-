New Jersey  local governments may be
exposed to more credit risk as they guarantee the debt of other
entities, a strategy that led to default in Harrisburg,
 Pennsylvania , Moody’s Investors Service said.  Local governments that pledged their full faith and credit
to guarantee the general-obligation debt of enterprises and
other municipalities was 7.9 percent of all Moody’s-rated New
Jersey local-government issuance in 2008. In 2011, that figure
increased to about 29 percent, Moody’s said in a report today.  Moody’s examined impaired credit in Collingswood, Salem and
Hoboken, all with non-investment-grade ratings; and Hudson
County, rated Aa3, Moody’s fifth-lowest investment grade. The
governments saw their borrowing power fall on soured projects
involving residential redevelopment, a privately run hospital,
office leases and a soccer stadium.  The report cited Harrisburg as “an extreme example of
credit stress driven by a guarantee obligation for a failed
enterprise.” The city, which backed $310 million of debt for a
failed incinerator project, missed $65 million of guaranteed
payments over three years and defaulted on its own general-
obligation debt in March.  The local governments act as “backup” security, and in
some cases can bypass debt limits, according to the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
