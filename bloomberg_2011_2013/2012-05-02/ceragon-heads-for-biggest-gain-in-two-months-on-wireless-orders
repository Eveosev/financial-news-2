Ceragon Networks Ltd. (CRNT)  headed for the
biggest advance in more than two months after the maker of
wireless networking systems received orders for high-capacity
wireless equipment.  The  shares  advanced 3.1 percent, poised for the largest
gain since Feb. 21, to 36.40 shekels at 12:25 p.m. in  Tel Aviv .
The benchmark TA-25 index advanced less than 0.1 percent.  Ceragon said it will provide high-capacity wireless point-
to-point and point-to-multipoint solutions and “last mile”
equipment to the  Florida  Rural Broadband Alliance. The new
network will provide high-speed broadband services to 15
counties in Florida.  To contact the reporter on this story:
