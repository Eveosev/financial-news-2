Camargo Correa SA is still submitting
information about its 2.48 billion-euro ($3.3 billion) bid to
buy out Cimpor- Cimentos de Portugal SGPS SA  to  Portugal ’s
Securities Market Commission, CMVM Chairman  Carlos Tavares  said.  “We are still receiving information which we consider to
be essential,” Tavares said at a parliamentary hearing in
Lisbon today. “The offer period will only begin after it is
registered with the regulator.”  Tavares said it was difficult to determine whether there
exists an agreement between the Portuguese cement company’s
Brazilian shareholders Camargo Correa and Votorantim
Participacoes SA on Cimpor if both parties deny it.  Camargo Correa, Brazil’s No. 2 construction company, on
March 30 offered 5.50 euros a share to buy the remaining 67
percent of Cimpor it doesn’t already own. Votorantim
Participacoes SA, which competes with Camargo in  Brazil ’s cement
market, owns a 21 percent stake of Cimpor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
