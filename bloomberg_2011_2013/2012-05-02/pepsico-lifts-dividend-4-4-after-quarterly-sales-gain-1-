  PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) , the world’s largest
snack-food maker, increased its dividend by 4.4 percent after
reporting a jump in first-quarter sales.  The company, based in Purchase,  New York , will pay $2.15 a
share over the course of a year, up from $2.06, according to a
statement today. PepsiCo, which said it raised the dividend for
the 40th consecutive year, makes payments quarterly.  PepsiCo, led by Chief Executive Officer  Indra Nooyi , said
on April 26 that first-quarter sales rose 4.1 percent to $12.4
billion, as revenue in the Latin America Foods unit grew 11
percent on higher pricing. Net income fell 1.4 percent from a
year earlier to $1.13 billion, or 71 cents a share.  Nooyi is cutting 8,700 jobs this year to reduce expenses as
she plans to spend as much as $600 million more on marketing to
win back soft-drink market share from Coca-Cola Co.  The company’s next quarterly dividend, of 53.75 cents a
share, is payable on June 29 to stockholders of record June 1,
the company said in the statement.  PepsiCo climbed 0.5 percent to $66.83 at the close in New
York. The shares fell 3.6 percent in the 12 months through
today, compared with a 14 percent jump for  Coca-Cola. (KO)   To contact the reporter on this story:
