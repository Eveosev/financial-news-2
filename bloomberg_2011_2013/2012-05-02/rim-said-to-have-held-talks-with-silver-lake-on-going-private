Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM) , the maker of
the BlackBerry smartphone, once held talks with private-equity
firm Silver Lake about a possible deal to take the company
private, a person familiar with the discussions said.  The talks occurred before current Chief Executive Officer
Thorsten Heins took charge in January,  according to the person ,
who asked not to be named because the negotiations were private.
The discussions were preliminary and the two sides weren’t able
to agree on a potential valuation, the person said. The deal
would have allowed RIM to work on a turnaround without the
scrutiny of being a public company.  Tenille Kennedy, a spokeswoman for Waterloo, Ontario-based
RIM, declined to comment, as did Gemma Hart, a spokeswoman for
 Silver Lake .  RIM is preparing to release the BlackBerry 10 operating
system as the linchpin of a comeback plan. Sales tumbled 25
percent last quarter, with U.S. revenue plummeting more than 50
percent. The old BlackBerry, best-suited for checking e-mail and
other business functions, has struggled to keep up with the Web
capabilities and applications of Apple Inc.’s iPhone and Google
Inc.’s Android devices.  RIM  shares  declined 5 percent to $12.80 today at the close
in  New York . The stock has lost almost three-quarters of its
value over the past year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
