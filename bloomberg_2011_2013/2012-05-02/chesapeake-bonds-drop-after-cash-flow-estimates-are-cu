The cost to protect against losses on
the debt of  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  jumped to the highest since
September 2009 as the driller, which reported an unexpected
first-quarter loss, said it may run out of money next year.  Credit-default swaps  on the company jumped 3.3 percentage
points to 7.4 percent upfront as of about 12:30 p.m. in New
York, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. The
driller’s $1.3 billion of 6.775 percent bonds due in March 2019
dropped by 4.1 cents to 94.9 cents on the dollar at 12:20 p.m.,
the lowest level on record, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The second-largest U.S. natural-gas producer reported a
first-quarter loss of $71 million as it cut its cash flow
estimates by as much as 48 percent with falling natural gas
prices hurting company profits, it said in a statement
yesterday. The driller also announced plans to strip CEO Aubrey McClendon of the role of chairman as investors criticized him
for using company interests to secure personal loans, raising
concerns over corporate governance.  “The company was headed into 2012 without any hedges on
natural gas production and the market is rightfully concerned as
gas prices have gone lower,”  Mark Hanson , an equity analyst at
Morningstar Inc. said in a telephone interview.  Company Spokesman Jim Gipson couldn’t be reached for a
comment.  Make or Break  “In 2011, they thought natural gas prices had hit a
rock bottom and it didn’t and now they are paying a price for
it,” Hanson said. “2013 is a make or break year for the
company.”  McClendon said the company had planned for an increase in
debt levels in the first quarter because of low gas prices and
capital expenditure, in an earnings call with investors today.
Chesapeake has about $1.7 billion of bonds maturing by 2015,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company has a $9.5
billion year-end net long term debt target.  Natural gas prices touched a more than 10-year intraday low
of $1.902 per million British Thermal Units last month on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange .  The cost of the Chesapeake swaps contracts means buyers of
protection would pay $740,000 initially and $500,000 annually to
protect $10 million of debt from default for five years.  Markit CDX Index  A gauge of corporate credit risk for U.S. issuers also
increased today as data showed American companies added the
fewest workers in seven months and euro-area unemployment rose
to a 15-year high.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark of high-grade companies that
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, added 0.2 basis point to a mid
price of 94 basis points at 2:34 p.m. in  New York , according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg. The index typically rises as
investor confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves.  The measure increased as employers added 119,000 workers
last month, according to figures from Roseland, New Jersey-based
ADP Employer Services. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 170,000 advance. The
euro-area jobless rate rose to 10.9 percent in March from 10.8
percent in February, the highest since April 1997, the European
Union statistics office in Luxembourg said.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract
protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
