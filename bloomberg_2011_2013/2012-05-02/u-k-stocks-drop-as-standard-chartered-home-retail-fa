U.K. stocks  declined the most in more
than a week as a contraction in euro-region manufacturing added
to signs that the economic slump in Britain’s largest export
market is worsening.  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  led banks lower, retreating 3.9
percent.  Home Retail Group Plc (HOME)  tumbled 13 percent after
reporting a 60 percent slump in profit.  British Sky Broadcasting
Group Plc (BSY)  paced advancing shares after operating earnings jumped
20 percent.  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index lost 54.12, or 0.9 percent, to 5,758.11
at the close in London. The gauge jumped 1.3 percent yesterday,
its biggest rally since April 17 as gauge of U.S. manufacturing
expanded at the fastest pace in 10 months. The FTSE All-Share
Index declined 0.8 percent today and Ireland’s ISEQ Index
slipped 0.1 percent.  “We have seen some of yesterday’s enthusiasm wane today,
but there is still an appetite for risk out there,” said  David Jones , chief market strategist at IG Index in  London . “Some of
the data coming out of  Europe  is a concern and raises the
question of how long the European economy will take to get on a
firmer footing; it can’t just be the U.S. driving growth.”  A report today showed  manufacturing  in the euro area shrank
for a ninth month in April. A factory gauge based on a survey of
purchasing managers slipped to 45.9 from 47.7 in March,
according to London-based Markit Economics. That’s the lowest in
34 months and compares with an estimate of 46 published on April
23. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  German Unemployment Climbs  German unemployment unexpectedly rose for the first time in
six months in April. The number of people out of work increased
a seasonally adjusted 19,000 to 2.87 million, the Nuremberg-
based Federal Labor Agency said. Economists had forecast a
decline of 10,000, the median of 34 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey showed.  In the U.S., a report from ADP Employer Services showed
that companies added the fewest number of workers in seven
months in April. Employment increased by 119,000 following a
revised 201,000 gain the prior month, the data showed.  Standard Chartered  led banks lower, falling 3.9 percent to
1,453 pence as the  U.K.’s second-largest lender by market value 
said operating profit in the first quarter expanded by a “low
double-digit” rate from a year earlier. The bank also said it
had “high single-digit” revenue growth for the period. Even
so, the company said sales was curbed by the U.S. dollar’s
strength against Asian currencies.  Barclays, Lloyds, RBS  Barclays Plc (BARC)  lost 5.1 percent to 213.65 pence and  Lloyds
Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  fell 4.5 percent to 32.08 pence after the
shares jumped 8.3 percent yesterday.  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc (RBS) , which is due to report earnings on May 4, slid 2.1
percent to 24.77 pence.  A  gauge of U.K. banks stocks  jumped 2.3 percent yesterday,
its biggest advance in two weeks.  Home Retail sank 13 percent to 87.55 pence after the owner
of the Argos and Homebase chains said it won’t pay a  final
dividend . The company posted a 60 percent drop in annual profit
to 102 million pounds ($165 million). That still beat the
average analyst estimate of 96.7 million pounds, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  “The group’s performance in the short term cannot be
immune from the economic environment,” Chairman Oliver Stocken
said in the statement. “Against this economic backdrop, the
board has decided not to recommend a final dividend this year.”  BSkyB, Next Gain  BSkyB climbed 1.5 percent to 701.5 pence for a third day of
gains. The U.K.’s biggest pay-TV operator reported a jump in
operating profit to 1.19 billion pounds in the nine months to
the end of March as the company gained broadband customers.
Sales rose 5 percent to 5.08 billion pounds.  Next Plc (NXT)  increased 2.6 percent to 2,971 pence, climbing for
the first time in three days. The  U.K.’s second-largest clothing
retailer  maintained its annual profit forecast after a first
quarter in which the growth of the Directory home-shopping unit
compensated for a drop in store sales.  The company  predicted pretax profit  of 560 million pounds
to 610 million pounds compared with the previous year’s 579.5
million pounds.  Housebuilders advanced as U.K. mortgage approvals rose to
49,860 loans in March. That compared with 49,029 in February,
the  Bank of England  said today in London. Economists had
forecast 48,000, according to the median of 21 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey.  Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/)  increased 2.6 percent to 51.95 pence,
 Bellway Plc (BWY)  jumped 2.7 percent to 808 pence and  Barratt
Developments Plc (BDEV)  gained 2.4 percent to 135.2 pence.  To contact the reporters on this story:
