Peru will seek investors for a 1.4
billion soles ($530 million) irrigation project on the country’s
northern coast as it seeks to boost agricultural exports,
Cabinet Chief Oscar Valdes said.  The Chinecas project in Ancash will create 90,000 jobs and
boost the Andean country’s hydroelectric output, Valdes said in
an e-mailed statement. The project will involve public and
private investment, he said.  Peru is the world’s largest exporter of asparagus, organic
bananas and organic coffee, according to the government’s
private investment promotion agency known as Proinversion.
Agricultural produce accounted for $2.83 billion of its $46
billion of exports last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
