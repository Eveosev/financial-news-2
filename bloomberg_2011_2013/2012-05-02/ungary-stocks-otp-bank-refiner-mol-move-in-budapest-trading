Hungary’s benchmark  BUX (BUX)  index fell 1.2
percent to 18,025.36 by the close in Budapest.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , Hungary’s largest lender,
retreated 0.2 percent to 3,801 forint as European stocks fell
after an industry report showed that American employers added
fewer jobs than economists projected last month. OTP shares had
jumped as much as 3.4 percent earlier today after UBS AG raised
its recommendation on the stock to buy from neutral yesterday.  Mol Nyrt. (MOL)  , Hungary’s largest refiner, declined 1.1
percent to 17,700 forint. Crude oil futures extended declines
after the U.S. Energy Department said stockpiles rose to the
highest level in 21 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
