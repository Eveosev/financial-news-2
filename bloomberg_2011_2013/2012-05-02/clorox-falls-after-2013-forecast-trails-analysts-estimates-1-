Clorox Co. (CLX) , maker of Hidden Valley
salad dressing and Kingsford Charcoal, fell the most in seven
months after forecasting 2013 profit that was less than
analysts’ estimates.  Clorox declined 3.2 percent to $67.80 at the close in New
York, the biggest drop since Sept. 26. The company said today it
expects adjusted profit next year to be $4.20 to $4.35 a share.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated $4.42.  Higher administrative and commodity costs will pinch profit
next year, along with “uncertainty” in some international
markets, the Oakland, California-based company said. Clorox said
it expects earnings before interest and taxes to be the same
percentage of sales as last year.  Clorox reaffirmed its 2012 profit forecast of as much as
$4.10 a share and reported third-quarter profit from continuing
operations fell to $134 million, or $1.02 a share. Costs for raw
materials hurt profit, Clorox said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
