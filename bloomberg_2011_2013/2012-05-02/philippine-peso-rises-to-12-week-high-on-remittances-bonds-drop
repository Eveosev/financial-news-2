The Philippine peso reached a 12-week

are increasing. Bonds rose.  Remittances account for about 10 percent of the $200
billion economy, and inflows usually accelerate before the
opening of the regular school term in June. They quickened to a
6.9 percent pace in May 2011 from a year earlier after an
increase of 6.3 percent the previous month, central bank data
show.  “Remittances have been coming in strong,” said Lito Mercado, head of trading at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. in
 Manila . “Many players are positioned for that. In the next four
weeks, we’ll see more and more remittances for tuition
payments.”  The peso advanced 0.1 percent to 42.190 per dollar at the
close in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency
touched 42.110, the strongest level since Feb. 9. One-month
implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate swings used to
price options, was unchanged at 4.50 percent.  The yield on the  Philippines ’ 6.5 percent bonds due April
2021 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.25
percent, according to prices from Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
