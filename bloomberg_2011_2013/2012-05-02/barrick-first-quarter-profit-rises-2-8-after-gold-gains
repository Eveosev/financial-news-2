Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s
largest producer of the metal, reported a 2.8 percent increase
in first-quarter profit after gold prices rose.  Net income advanced to $1.03 billion, or $1.03 a share,
from $1 billion, or $1, a year earlier, Toronto-based Barrick
said today in a statement. Profit excluding impairment charges
and other one-time items was $1.09 a share, matching the average
of 18 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales rose 18 percent to $3.64 billion. The company raised
its quarterly dividend to 20 cents a share from 15 cents and
reiterated its 2012 production forecast.  “Barrick has a reputation as being one of the best
operators and being the ‘Steady Eddie’ of the gold-mining
sector, and it’s deserved,”  George Topping , an analyst at
Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Toronto, said in a telephone interview
yesterday.  Chief Executive Officer Aaron Regent plans to boost annual
production to about 9 million ounces of gold by 2016, from as
much as 7.8 million ounces forecast this year. Gold, which has
risen for 11 straight years, averaged $1,694 an ounce in the
quarter in New York, 22 percent more than a year earlier.  First-quarter gold production was 1.88 million ounces, down
from 1.96 million ounces a year earlier. Topping estimated 1.79
million ounces.  Higher Costs  So-called total cash costs rose 25 percent to $545 an
ounce. Brian Yu, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in  San Francisco ,
estimated $559 while Stephen Walker, a Toronto-based analyst at
 RBC Capital Markets , estimated $577.  Barrick reiterated that gold production in 2012 will be 7.3
million to 7.8 million ounces with total cash costs of $520 to
$560 an ounce.  Barrick’s Pueblo Viejo project in the  Dominican Republic  is
expected to begin production in the middle of this year, the
company said. The Pascua-Lama mine, on the border between Chile
and  Argentina , will start up in mid-2013.  Barrick said it’s reviewing the cost and scheduling for
Pascua-Lama, which is being affected by labor and commodity cost
pressures. About 70 percent of the current $4.7 billion to $5
billion cost estimate has been committed, it said.  The cost challenges at Pascua-Lama and a potential delay in
startup will probably “reinforce concerns about the wisdom of
proceeding with development on large longer term development
projects during a period of rampant cost inflation,”  Greg Barnes , a Toronto-based analyst at TD Newcrest, said in a note
today.  Barrick fell 2.7 percent to C$38.80 at the close in
Toronto.  The shares  have dropped 16 percent this year.  (Barrick started a conference call at 4:30 p.m.  New York
