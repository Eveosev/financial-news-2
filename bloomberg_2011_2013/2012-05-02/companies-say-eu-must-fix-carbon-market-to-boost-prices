Europe must improve its emissions
program to boost the price of carbon and should promote clean
technologies as a foundation for future growth, according to
companies including  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Acciona SA. (ANA)   The European Union’s emissions trading system needs a
“meaningful recalibration,” after the price of permits dropped
to a record low, according to a statement published before a
meeting of companies with senior EU officials in Brussels today.  “This action will provide a strong carbon-dioxide price
signal that business can respond to and ensure Europe makes the
rapid progress needed to improve  energy efficiency  and support
low-carbon technologies,” Graeme Sweeney, Shell’s vice
president of Future Fuels and CO2, said in the statement.  One way to bolster the world’s biggest carbon market is to
withhold some permits in the next phase of the cap-and-trade
program starting in 2013, Sweeney said in the statement
published by the Prince of  Wales ’s EU Corporate Leaders Group on
 Climate Change , or EU CLG, which also includes Unilever, the
world’s second-biggest consumer goods company.  Commission Meeting  Members of the EU CLG are meeting today with European
Commission PresidentJose Barroso, Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard and Environment Commissioner Janez Potocnik to discuss
the role of green innovation and the development of low-carbon
economy.  EU carbon permits for December slumped 68 percent in the
past year to a record low of 5.99 percent last month on concerns
that the system will be oversupplied for most of its next
trading phase through 2020 after recessions and debt crises
curbed industrial output. Permits closed 4.6 percent lower at
7.09 euros on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange today.  The European Commission, the EU regulatory arm, is planning
to seek a review of carbon-permit auctioning rules as of 2013 to
delay some volumes at the beginning of the next trading period,
Hedegaard said on April 19. Such a revision would require
support from member states to pass.  To contact the reporter on this story:
