California-blend gasoline in San
Francisco rose to the highest level in more than six months as
 Phillips 66 (PSX-W) ,  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)  perform
maintenance on units at their Northern  California  refineries.  Tesoro shut the hydrocracker at the Golden Eagle refinery
until around May 21 for work, a person with knowledge of the
schedule said yesterday. Phillips 66 is performing a turnaround
on a hydrocracker at the Rodeo plant, two people said April 26.
Shell shut a catalytic cracker at the Martinez refinery April 21
for a month of work, a regulatory notice shows.  California-blend, or Carbob, gasoline in San Francisco rose
5.5 cents to a premium of 41.5 cents a gallon against gasoline
futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the highest level since Oct.
11.  Tina Barbee, a spokeswoman at Tesoro’s headquarters in  San
Antonio , said in an e-mail yesterday that the Golden Eagle
refinery is performing “planned maintenance activities.” She
declined to say which units are involved in the work.  Los Angeles  Carbob jumped 6 cents to a 36-cent-a-gallon
premium to gasoline futures, the highest level since Feb. 24.  Phillips 66 is scheduled to flare gases through May 3 at
the 139,000-barrel-a-day Los Angeles refinery, which is
performing planned maintenance.  Gasoline inventories in California dropped 9.1 percent, or
562,000, to 5.63 million barrels in the week ended April 27, the

Distillate supplies slipped 1.7 percent, or 56,000, to 3.32
million barrels, the state said.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in  San Francisco  rose 1
cent to a premium of 21 cents a gallon versus Nymex heating oil
futures. The same fuel in Los Angeles slipped 0.25 cent to an
11.5-cent-a-gallon premium to futures.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon , a
benchmark for the U.S. Northwest, strengthened 2.5 cents to 22.5
cents a gallon above gasoline futures.  Gasoline inventories  on the U.S. West Coast, known as the
Padd 5 region, dropped 3.6 percent to 28.3 million barrels last
week, the Energy Department said in a report today. That’s the
