A leader of Israeli Prime Minister
 Benjamin Netanyahu ’s Likud Party introduced legislation to
dissolve parliament and hold early elections on Sept. 4.  The motion was submitted today by Zeev Elkin, head of the
Likud delegation in the Knesset,  Israel ’s 120-seat parliament,
and will be debated starting May 7, Knesset spokesman Yotam Yakir said.  Netanyahu said earlier this week that he was contemplating
early elections. Aides have since been negotiating with both the
prime minister’s coalition allies and leaders of the opposition
to coordinate an orderly finish to the current term of the
government, which took office three years ago.  Tensions among the parties within Netanyahu’s governing
coalition over issues ranging from budget allocations to
drafting ultra-Orthodox Jews led to the decision to propose new
elections, which weren’t required to be held until late 2013.  To contact the reporters on this story:
