Oil fell after the U.S. Energy
Department reported that crude inventories surged to the highest
level in more than 21 years and production and imports climbed.  Futures dropped 0.9 percent after the department said
 supplies  rose 2.84 million barrels to 375.9 million last week,
the most since September 1990. Output increased 8,000 barrels a
day to 6.12 million, the highest level since November 1999.
Crude also decreased as U.S. employers added fewer jobs than
forecast in April and factory orders declined in March.  “Prices should be lower because there’s no shortage of oil
and we’re looking at rather anemic economic growth,” said  Chip Hodge , who oversees a $9 billion natural-resource bond portfolio
as senior managing director at Manulife Asset Management in
 Boston . “We’re getting robust builds in supply.”  Crude oil for June delivery fell 94 cents to settle at
$105.22 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  in the
biggest decline since April 18. Futures have slipped 7.3 percent
in the past year.  Brent oil for June settlement dropped $1.46, or 1.2
percent, to end the session at $118.20 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European benchmark
contract settled at a $12.98 premium to New York futures, the
narrowest gap based on closing prices since Jan. 31.  Inventories of crude were projected to increase 2.5 million
barrels, according to the median of 11 analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg survey.  Oil  imports  rose 56,000 barrels a day to 8.82 million, the
report showed. Fuel imports dropped 50,000 barrels to 1.81
million barrels a day.  Cushing Supply  Supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for the
 New York  oil contract, rose 1.21 million barrels to a record 43
million, the report showed. Stockpiles at the hub have climbed
13 of the last 15 weeks.  “There’s no fundamental reason for oil to be up here given
how much we have in storage,” said Todd Horwitz, chief
strategist at Adam Mesh Trading Group in  Chicago . “There’s
plenty of oil on hand.”  Companies operated refineries at 86 percent of capacity
last week,  up 1.3  percentage points from the previous seven
days, the report showed. It was the highest utilization rate
since the week ended Dec. 2.  Gasoline inventories  fell 2.01 million barrels to 209.7
million last week, the lowest level since Nov. 18. Supplies of
 distillate fuel , a category that includes heating oil and
diesel, dropped 1.9 million barrels to 124 million, the lowest
level since October 2008.  ‘Steady Drumbeat’  Employment increased by 119,000 in April following a
revised 201,000 gain the prior month, according to figures from
Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Employer Services. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a
170,000 advance.  “The ADP numbers took the wind out of the sails of the
market,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The market needs a
steady drumbeat of positive economic news to move higher.”  The Labor Department’s payrolls report for April will be
released on May 4 and is forecast to show that employers added
160,000 jobs.  Orders with U.S. factories fell 1.5 percent in March after
a revised 1.1 percent gain the prior month, figures from the
Commerce Department showed today in  Washington . The  median
projection  of 61 economists in a Bloomberg survey called for a
1.6 percent decline.  “Slowing economic numbers indicate that there is less
demand,” said Marshall Berol, co-portfolio manager of the
Encompass Fund in  San Francisco , which manages about $300
million of assets. “Less activity is probably the main cause of
the increase in inventories.”  European Unemployment  Unemployment in countries that share the euro rose to the
highest level in almost 15 years and manufacturing contracted
for a ninth consecutive month, adding to signs the economy
continues to weaken.  The jobless rate in the 17-nation euro area increased to
10.9 percent in March from 10.8 percent in February, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.
That’s the highest level since April 1997, when the rate reached
a record at the time of 10.9 percent, according to data
Bloomberg has compiled since 1990.  The European jobs number sent the euro and commodities
lower. The common currency slipped 0.6 percent versus the dollar
at 3:11 p.m. in New York. A falling euro reduces the appeal of
raw materials as an investment. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index
of 24 commodities was down 1.3 percent, the biggest decline
since April 10.  Easing Tensions  Oil in New York has fallen 4.8 percent from a March 1 peak
of $110.55 a barrel as tensions have eased between  Iran  and
Western nations over the country’s nuclear program.  “Oil at over $100 a barrel doesn’t feel right,” Hodge
said. “There’s been a security premium in the price due to the
tensions with Iran. That premium appears to be shrinking.”  Electronic trading volume of crude oil on the Nymex was
539,462 contracts as of 3:11 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled
568,789 contracts yesterday, 8.5 percent below the three-month
average. Open interest was 1.6 million, the highest level since
May 16, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
