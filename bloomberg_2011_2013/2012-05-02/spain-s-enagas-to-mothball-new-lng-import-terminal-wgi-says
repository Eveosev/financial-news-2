Enagas SA (ENG) , operator of  Spain ’s
natural-gas grid, plans to mothball a liquefied fuel import
terminal as soon as construction is complete, World Gas
Intelligence reported, citing an unidentified Enagas official.  The 7 billion-cubic-meter-a-year El Musel facility in
northern Spain, the country’s seventh LNG site, will be shut as
soon as it’s finished in December due to low demand for the
fuel, according to the report.  Enagas didn’t immediately answer a phone call seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
