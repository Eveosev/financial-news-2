Mexico  economists expect the country’s
gross domestic product to expand 3.62 percent this year, the
highest forecast since July, according to the central bank’s
monthly  economic survey  for April.  Economists and consulting firms had forecast growth of 3.43
percent in March and 4.09 percent in July. Inflation will end
this year at 3.68 percent, the lowest estimate since the 3.68
percent projected in November, the survey showed.  Consumption and investment by private industry will drive
growth this year, rising 4.02 percent and 6.25 percent
respectively, analysts forecast. That compares with the March
estimates of 3.76 percent and 5.30 percent. Mexico’s economy
expanded about 4 percent in the first quarter of the year, the
 Finance Ministry  said April 30 in its monthly budget report.  The increase in domestic consumption and investment was
supported by an expansion of formal employment and lending, the
Finance Ministry said in the e-mailed statement.  Core inflation  will finish 2012 at 3.48 percent, the lowest
forecast since January, according to today’s central bank
survey.  Economists estimated growth of 3.50 percent for 2013, the
same forecast as the March survey, the report showed.  The peso weakened 0.4 percent to 12.9610 per dollar at
10:57 a.m. Mexico City time from 12.9162.  To contact the reporter on this story:
