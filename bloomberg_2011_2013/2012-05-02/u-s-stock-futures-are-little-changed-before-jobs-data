U.S. stocks fell, dragging the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  down from the highest level since 2007,
as data showed companies added fewer jobs than economists
projected and euro-region unemployment rose to a 15-year high.  Energy and  financial  shares dropped the most among 10
groups in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Chesapeake Energy
Corp. (CHK)  tumbled 15 percent after reporting an unexpected loss and
saying it may run out of money next year under the weight of the
lowest natural-gas prices in a decade.  Bank of America Corp. 
retreated 1.8 percent. Stocks pared their slump as a gauge of
 homebuilders  in S&P indexes advanced to the highest since 2008.  The S&P 500 slid 0.3 percent to 1,402.31 at 4 p.m. New York
time, after falling 0.9 percent earlier today. The Dow dropped
10.75 points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,268.57. The Nasdaq Composite
Index increased 0.3 percent to 3,059.85 as  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  shares
rebounded. About 6.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S.
exchanges, or 1.4 percent below the three-month average.  “The labor market is weak at best,” said  Keith Wirtz , who
oversees $15 billion as chief investment officer for Fifth Third
Asset Management in Cincinnati. “While we thought that we were
gaining some momentum, more recent data suggest that things are
sluggish. If we start to see a cascade of negative news, the
market is going to be vulnerable.”  Equities fell as American companies added 119,000 workers
in April, the fewest in seven months, according to a private
report. Concern about  Europe ’s economy also helped drive stocks
lower today. The  jobless rate  in the euro area rose to 10.9
percent in March, manufacturing contracted last month and
 unemployment  in  Germany  unexpectedly increased.  Economic Surprises  The decline in stocks came after the  S&P 500  rose to the
 highest  level in almost a month yesterday. Today’s payroll
survey intensified concern that Labor Department data in two
days may show the U.S. isn’t growing fast enough to reduce
unemployment. An index of forecasting  accuracy  shows data have
been worse than economists predicted. The Citigroup Economic
Surprise Index is at minus 20.40, the lowest since October.  “I’ve got a feeling that we might see a downside surprise
on the monthly jobs report,”  Randy Frederick , managing director
of active trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab Corp., said
from Austin,  Texas . His firm has $1.83 trillion in client
assets. “Given how high the market is right now and this
softening in economic data, it’s very likely to see a pullback
in the range of 5 percent to 10 percent.”  Investors bought stocks this year on better-than-estimated
earnings, sending the S&P 500 up 12 percent. About  73 percent  of
S&P 500 companies that reported results since April 10 have
beaten projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Energy Stocks  Six out of 10 groups in the S&P 500 retreated as energy
shares slumped 1.6 percent. Oil dropped from a five-week high
after the U.S. Energy Department said stockpiles rose to the
highest level in 21 years.  Byron Wien , the 79 year-old chairman
of Blackstone Group LP’s advisory services unit, is forecasting
an annual drop in  oil prices  for the first time in his career as
 swelling production  pushes global inventories higher.  Chesapeake tumbled 15 percent, the most since 2008, to
$16.74. The company slashed its full-year 2012 and 2013
operating cash flow estimates by as much as 48 percent, and
increased the amount of assets it plans to sell. This year’s
 cash flow  estimate was lowered to $2.7 billion to $3 billion,
from a February forecast of $4.5 billion to $5.2 billion.  The shares surged 6.3 percent yesterday amid plans to strip
Chief Executive Officer  Aubrey McClendon  of the chairman’s job
and end an executive perk that allowed him to buy personal
stakes in every well the company drilled.  ‘Deeply Sorry’  “I’m deeply sorry for all of the distractions of the past
two weeks,” McClendon, co-founder of Oklahoma City-based
Chesapeake, said on a conference call to discuss first-quarter
results today. McClendon said the company may have to sell more
assets than planned to cover a gap between cash flow and revenue
if natural-gas prices remain depressed.  The KBW Bank Index dropped 0.9 percent as 18 of its 24
stocks retreated.  Bank of America  declined 1.8 percent to $8.16.
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  slipped 2.7 percent to $32.70.  Bankrate Inc. (RATE)  plunged 15 percent, the most since it went
public in June, to $20.19. The online publisher of personal
finance information reported first-quarter earnings and revenue
that fell short of estimates.  OpenTable Inc. (OPEN)  sank 15 percent, the biggest decline since
going public in 2009, to $37.13. The online restaurant-
reservation service forecast  revenue  in 2012 of no more than
$164 million, compared with the average analyst estimate of
$168.5 million.  Homebuilders Rally  Stocks pared losses as a gauge of  homebuilders  in S&P
indexes rose 2.5 percent.  Lennar Corp. (LEN)  gained 2.7 percent to
$29.02. D.R. Horton Inc. added 3.4 percent to $17.22.  An International Strategy & Investment survey released
yesterday showed sales by homebuilders climbed to a six-year
high. The Los Angeles Times reported that the Federal Housing
Finance Agency is under pressure to allow  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie
Mac  to reduce loan principal amounts for struggling borrowers.  A rebound in Apple, the world’s most valuable company, also
helped trim some of the earlier slump in equities. Apple rose
0.7 percent to $585.98, after dropping for four straight days.  CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS)  rose 2.7 percent to $45.92. The largest
provider of prescription drugs in the U.S. reported first-
quarter profit that  exceeded  analysts’ estimates after grabbing
customers from Walgreen Co.  Con-way Inc. (CNW)  advanced 13 percent to $37. The U.S. trucking
company said it earned 45 cents a share excluding some items in
the first quarter. Analysts, on average, estimated 34 cents,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  Nike at Record  Nike Inc. (NKE) , the world’s largest sporting-goods company,
surged to an  all-time high  today. The shares added 2.7 percent
to $114.28, extending this year’s rally to 19 percent.  TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP)  surged 17 percent to $42.63 for the
biggest gain in the S&P 500. The online travel-recommendation
service spun off from Expedia Inc. reported first-quarter profit
and  sales  that topped some analysts’ estimates.  Financial shares are sending a signal that stock investors
may be better off without a “sell in May” strategy this year,
said Ari H. Wald, a Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. analyst.  The S&P 500’s financial stocks are beating the benchmark
this year after lagging behind in  2011. (SPX)  The group’s weakness
last year preceded five straight months of declines, from May
through September, for the S&P 500.  Banks, insurers and other financial companies posted the
year’s biggest gain among the S&P 500’s 10 main industry groups
through yesterday. Their industry index rose 20 percent, just
beating a 19 percent advance in a gauge of technology stocks.  Economic Swings  Another favorable sign is that computer-related companies
and other groups sensitive to economic swings are market leaders
this year, Wald wrote yesterday in a report. Industries less
affected by the economy’s performance were top performers
through the first four months of last year.  There are indicators of weakness as well, he wrote. The
number of  52-week highs  in U.S. stocks after subtracting lows is
shrinking, investor concern about a market slump has faded,
yields on Treasury debt are low by historical standards, and
commodity prices have fallen in the past two months.  The slump in these and other market barometers “has not
progressed to the point that they support a bearish outlook as
they did in May 2011,” Wald wrote. Instead, they point toward a
“lack of full confirmation in either direction,” according to
the New York-based analyst.  To contact the reporter on this story:
