Luxury-home prices in central  London 
rose in April as demand, particularly from overseas buyers,
exceeded the number of properties for sale, Knight Frank LLP
said.  Values of houses and apartments costing about 3.7 million
pounds ($6 million) increased by an average of 11.4 percent from
a year earlier, the London-based broker said in a  report  today.
Prices gained 1.1 percent last month.  Overseas investors have turned to London residential real
estate to preserve wealth as they face political, economic and
financial upheaval in their home markets. Sales of properties
valued at more than 2 million pounds were subdued in April 2011,
when a higher  tax rate  came into effect and caused a rush of
buyers trying to avoid the levies during the preceding months.  “Activity was relatively weak last April,” said  Liam Bailey ,  Knight Frank ’s head of residential research. The number
of property sales agreed to in February through April was 50
percent higher than in the same three-month period a year ago,
he said.  Knight Frank compiles its luxury-homes index from its own
appraisal values of a sample of properties in the 13 most
expensive central London neighborhoods, such as Belgravia,
Kensington and Knightsbridge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
