State Oil Co. (ATPG)  of  Azerbaijan  said crude
production fell in the first three months of the year, declining
for at least the fourth straight quarter.  Socar, as the company is known, produced 2.03 million
metric tons of crude oil in the first quarter, the Baku-based
company said on its website, without giving a reason for the
decline. That is equivalent to 163,400 barrels a day, down about
2.8 percent from the average in the previous three-month period
and 4 percent less than a year earlier.  Gas output fell to 1.71 billion cubic meters from 1.74
billion cubic meters a year earlier, Socar said.  Azerbaijan, the third-largest oil producer in the former
Soviet Union after Russia and  Kazakhstan , produced 45.6 million
tons of oil and 25.7 billion cubic meters of gas last year. Oil
output decreased from 51 million tons in 2010 to ensure peak
production continues for 10 to 15 years, Socar Vice President
for Marketing and Investment Elsad Nasirov said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
