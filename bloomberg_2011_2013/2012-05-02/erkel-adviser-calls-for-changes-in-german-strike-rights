Wolfgang Franz , who heads German
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s council of economic advisers, called
for an overhaul of German strike rights to make the wage
negotiation process more efficient, according to an article he
wrote in Handelsblatt.  Sympathy strikes must be banned and warning strikes
restricted, Franz said in the article published today. Germany
needs a mandatory conciliation process with a binding “peace
period” that prevents workers from striking during wage
negotiations, he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
