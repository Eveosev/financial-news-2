Mali “will not abandon” residents in
the north of the country, which is under the control of ethnic
Touareg rebels and Islamist groups, Prime Minister Cheick Modibo Diarra said.  The Bamako-based government is “about to organize for you
to get food and drugs,” Modibo said in a speech broadcast on
state-owned ORTM today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
