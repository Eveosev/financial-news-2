Democratic Republic  of Congo called
for the arrest of General Bosco Ntaganda for leading an
insurrection in the country’s east, said Julien Paluku, the
governor of North Kivu province.  “He’s responsible for what is happening and he will face
justice,” he said by phone today from Goma, the provincial
capital. “He will face justice before a Congolese court and he
will be judged by the Congolese for the infractions that he’s
committed here.”  Congolese soldiers are fighting troops with links to
Ntaganda on three fronts in the province, according to the
 United Nations . Last month, about 300 soldiers loyal to him
deserted the army amid speculation he would be arrested.
Ntaganda is a former rebel who integrated into the army in 2009
after he was indicted by The Hague-based  International Criminal
Court  for  war crimes .  “The ICC, that’s his problem,” Paluku said. “We are
concerned about Congo.”  About 5,000 people have been displaced by fighting in the
province, the UN refugee agency said today in an e-mailed
statement. The political wing of Ntaganda’s former rebel group
denied he was involved in the mutiny in a statement on April 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
