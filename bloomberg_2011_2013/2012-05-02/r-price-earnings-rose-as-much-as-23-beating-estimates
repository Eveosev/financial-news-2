Mr Price Group Ltd., (MPC)  a South African
clothing, furniture and linen retailer, said annual earnings per
share climbed as much as 23 percent, more than double the gain
expected by 14 analysts. The shares rose to a record.  Earnings per share excluding one-time items in the 52 weeks
through March rose by at least 18 percent compared with the 53
weeks through April 2 last year, the Durban, South Africa-based
company said in a stock-exchange filing today.  Mr Price expects so-called headline earnings per share in
the range of 4.94 cents to 5.15 cents, according to Bloomberg
calculations based on the percentage increases provided by the
company. The analysts’ mean  estimate  for the period is 4.63
cents, or a gain of 10.6 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The retailer’s earnings have beat estimates five
times in the past six announcements.  The shares  gained  as much as 1.9 percent to 107.20 rand and
were trading at 106.61 rand as of 10 a.m. in Johannesburg. That
extends its advance over the past 12 months to 58 percent,
compared with a 32 percent increase in the  FTSE/JSE Africa
General Retailers Index. (JGENR)   To contact the reporter on this story:
