New Zealand ’s dollar fell to the
lowest level in more than five weeks versus its U.S. counterpart
after weaker-than-forecast economic data in  Europe  and the U.S.
reduced demand for higher-yielding currencies.  Australia ’s dollar touched a one-week low against the
greenback as stocks and commodities slumped. Both South Pacific
currencies strengthened earlier after a Chinese manufacturing
index rose in April. They erased the gains after reports showed
European manufacturing shrank in April and U.S. companies added
fewer workers than forecast.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, dropped 0.6
percent to 81.08 U.S. cents yesterday in New York and reached
80.87 cents, the weakest since March 22. The kiwi slumped 0.5
percent to 64.97 yen.  Australia’s dollar lost as much as 0.5 percent to $1.0285,
the weakest since April 24, before trading little changed at
$1.0333. It gained 0.2 percent earlier. The Aussie was little
changed at 82.78 yen.  The  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of stocks weakened 0.4 percent, and
the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials lost
1.3 percent.  A purchasing-manager index of euro-region manufacturing
shrank for a ninth month, falling to a 34-month low of 45.9 in
April from 47.7 in March, according to London-based Markit
Economics. A reading below 50 shows contraction.  U.S. companies’ payrolls increased by 119,000 workers last
month, after a revised 201,000 gain in March, according to
Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Employer Services. The median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
170,000 advance.  The 49.3 final reading of a Chinese factory gauge released
yesterday by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics compared
with a preliminary 49.1 reported April 23 and a final 48.3 in
March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
