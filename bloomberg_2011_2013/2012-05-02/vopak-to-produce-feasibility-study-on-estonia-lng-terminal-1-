Vopak LNG Holding BV, a unit of  Royal
Vopak NV (VPK) , will conduct a feasibility study for an Estonian
liquefied natural gas terminal at Muuga harbor, near Tallinn.  The study, due to be presented to the  Economy Ministry  in
August, will cover technical and economic details, the cost of
construction and the need for European Union funding, according
to the letter of intent signed with Estonia’s power grid company
Elering AS and port operator Tallinna Sadam AS.  The study will be useful “to convince the European
Commission of the suitability” of a Tallinn LNG terminal for
supplying “the whole of the Baltics and Finland,” Elering said
in an e-mailed statement today.  The company said the commission has previously expressed
support for the development of the LNG solution in the Baltics
on condition that it is “able to cover at least 25 percent of
the consumption of the entire region.”  Building an LNG terminal is part of the strategy of
 Estonia ’s ruling coalition to reduce dependence on  Russia ’s OAO
Gazprom, which owns 37 percent of local gas utility Eesti Gaas
and is the sole supplier of gas to Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania. The three countries have uneasy political relations
with their larger neighbor and point to supply risks and higher
natural-gas prices than in western  Europe .  The three Baltic countries asked the commission last
November to help decide whether a regional LNG terminal is
needed and where to build it, after failing to agree on a
location. A study by a unit of Poeyry Oyj, a Finnish engineering
company, commissioned by the Estonian government, concluded that
Estonia would be the best location, Prime Minister  Andrus Ansip 
said then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
