Swiss Re Ltd. (SREN) , the world’s second-
biggest reinsurer, may say it returned to profit in the first
quarter after record claims from earthquakes in  Japan  and  New
Zealand  produced a year-earlier loss.  Net income was probably $691 million, after a net loss of
$665 million a year ago, according to the mean estimate of seven
 analysts   surveyed  by Bloomberg. Swiss Re is due to report
earnings at 7 a.m. in Zurich on May 4.  Aon Benfield estimates that natural disasters caused less
than $3 billion of insured losses in the industry in the first
quarter, compared with almost $53 billion in the year-earlier
period. Swiss Re said last month that the Zurich-based firm
expects margins to improve because of new business at its life
and health unit and a “firming of the reinsurance cycle” at
the property and casualty division.  Swiss Re will provide a breakdown for its reinsurance,
corporate solutions and Admin Re units following a restructuring
of the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
