European banks that took part in last
year’s capital stress tests have satisfied the region’s top
regulator on their progress in raising capital, the  European
Banking Authority  said.  The regulator is “satisfied with the progress made in the
fulfillment” of banks’ promises to raise core tier 1 capital, a
measure of loss-bearing reserves, the EBA said in a  statement  on
its website today. “The actions taken include capital
strengthening and adequate recognition of losses,” it said.  Eight banks, out of the 90 tested, failed the European
Union stress tests in July 2011 with a combined capital
shortfall of 2.5 billion euros ($3.3 billion). The EBA, which is
required to run the exercises annually, will postpone this
year’s exams to allow banks to complete a fresh round of
capital-raising.  The EBA, set up last year to harmonize banking rules across
the European Union, has told banks to raise 114.7 billion euros
in fresh capital by the end of June as part of measures
introduced to respond to the euro area’s sovereign-debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
