Rajat Gupta  lost a bid to get
documents concerning settlement negotiations between the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission and witnesses cooperating
with a probe into insider trading at hedge funds.  The SEC is suing Gupta, a former  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
director, for allegedly passing inside information to Galleon
Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan yesterday said Gupta can’t see the tax
filings, financial statements and other records relating to the
agency’s discussions to settle claims against government
witnesses.  Gupta claimed the material would help him establish any
bias the witnesses may have against him or in favor of the
government, Rakoff said. The SEC has agreed to produce the
settlement agreements themselves.  “The negotiations are not the benefit the cooperator is
receiving,” Rakoff said. “The best evidence of bias in a
cooperator’s testimony comes from the actual agreement he struck
with the SEC, not from his lawyer’s attempt to get him a good
deal.”  Gupta’s criminal trial on related insider-trading charges
is scheduled for May 21. His lawyer  Gary Naftalis  didn’t
immediately return a phone message and e-mail seeking comment on
the ruling.  The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Gupta,
11-CV-7566, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
