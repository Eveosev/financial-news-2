Taiwan ’s dollar touched the strongest
level in almost eight months as the Taiex index rallied after
the government postponed an electricity-price increase.
 Government bonds  were little changed.  Electricity-price gains will take effect on June 10, later
than the originally scheduled May 15, and will be phased in over
a period of more than six months, according to a statement
posted by the island’s presidential office yesterday on its
website. Official data showed last week that the local economy
expanded for a 10th successive quarter in the three months
through March.  “Although Taiwan’s economy is still recovering, it’s still
in pretty good shape compared to the developed nations,” said
Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. in
Taipei. “Markets have been reflecting inflation concerns
recently.”  Taiwan’s dollar was little changed at NT$29.24 versus its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$29.08, the strongest level since Sept. 8. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings traders use to
price options, .dropped nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage
point, to 3.91 percent  The yield on the government’s 1 percent bonds due January
2017 was little changed at 1 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.505 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center. It reached 0.508 percent on April
30, the highest level since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
