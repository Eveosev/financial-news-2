(Corrects company name in first and last paragraphs.)  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) , the owner of
electric utilities in five U.S. states, bought a 10-megawatt
solar plant in Arizona from Solon Corp., formerly a unit of the
bankrupt German solar company Solon SE.  Power from the Black Mountain Solar Project will be sold to
 UniSource Energy Corp. (UNS)  under a 20-year power contract,
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke said today in a statement.
Terms for Duke’s purchase and the power contract weren’t
disclosed.  The plant is under construction near Kingman, Arizona, and
is expected to begin producing power in October. It’s Duke’s
12th solar farm, bringing total owned capacity to 59 megawatts,
according to a  fact sheet  on its website.  Solon Corp. was bought in March by Microsol International
when the United Arab Emirates-based solar-cell maker acquired
most of the assets of  Solon SE (SOO1) , which filed for insolvency
protection Dec. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
