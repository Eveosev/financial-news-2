Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY) ,  Nigeria ’s
biggest lender by market value, reached the highest in four
years and gained the most in almost nine months on bets of
higher earnings, according to  Renaissance Capital .  The stock  rose 5 percent  to close at 16.82 naira in Lagos,
the commercial capital, the biggest gain since Aug. 12 and the
highest price since April 2008.  Guaranty is projected to achieve a 40 percent growth in
earnings this year, compared with 37 percent for the Nigerian
banking industry, Adesoji Solanke, a Lagos-based Africa banking
analyst at Renaissance Capital, said by phone today. The
lender’s results for 2011 and the first quarter of this year
have demonstrated “the sustainability of its earnings
profile,” he said.  Full-year net income rose 37 percent to 52.65 billion
naira, the company said in March. First-quarter profit rose 35
percent to 19.3 billion naira, it said April 19.  Guaranty will benefit from expected high  interest rates ,
Solanke said. High interest rates “will be good for a bank like
Guaranty which is highly liquid and with very low cost of funds
of between 2 and 3 percent,” he said.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  raised interest rates to a
record 12 percent last year, and RenCap’s economists expect it
to remain at this level for most of this year, Solnake said.  Guaranty’s shares have risen 18 percent this year, compared
with a 7.6 percent rise in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
