Polish manufacturing fell more than
economists forecast in April as new orders declined at the
fastest pace in almost three years, HSBC Holdings Plc said.  The purchasing managers’ index, a gauge of manufacturing,
dropped to 49.2 from 50.1 in March, HSBC Holdings Plc said in an
e-mail today, summarizing a survey by  Markit Economics . The
median estimate of 15 economists in a Bloomberg survey was 49.5.  The index fell below 50, a level showing a contraction, for
the third time in the past six months, following uninterrupted
gains from November 2010 to October last year. Polish economic
growth will slow to 2.5 percent this year, the government
forecasts, from 4.3 percent in 2011 amid a recession in the euro
region, where the nation sells two-thirds of its exports.  “The economy is slowing as marked most recently by very
poor industrial production growth in March,”  Agata Urbanska , a
London-based economist at HSBC, said in an e-mailed statement
“The negative drag comes from the external environment with the
new export orders underperforming the new orders index in the
second half of last year and both falling to a lowest level
since mid-2009 in April.”  Polish industrial-output growth advanced an annual 0.7
percent in March, the lowest rate since November 2009, and  wage
expansion  slowed for a third month to 3.8 percent, the lowest in
15 months, data released last month showed.  The zloty traded at 4.159 per euro at 10 a.m. in Warsaw,
little changed from late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
