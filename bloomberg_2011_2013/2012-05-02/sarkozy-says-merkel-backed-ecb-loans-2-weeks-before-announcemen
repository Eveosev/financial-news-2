French President Nicolas Sarkozy says
he struck a deal with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  to back
three-year loans to banks by the  European Central Bank  at a
summit two weeks before the policy was announced by the ECB.  In a campaign debate against his Socialist challenger,
Francois Hollande, Sarkozy took credit for the loans that have
helped ease the region’s financial crisis. He said the key
meeting was at Nov. 24 meeting in Strasbourg, France, with
Merkel and Italian Premier  Mario Monti .  Responding to Hollande’s criticism that he had bowed to
Germany throughout the crisis, Sarkozy retorted, “the stability
of economic governance? Germany didn’t want it, it was a French
request.”  “Secondly,” Sarkozy continued, “when the ECB lends at 1
percent, as you mentioned, violating the letter of its treaties,
I obtained this at the Strasbourg summit with Monti, from
Germany.” ECB President  Mario Draghi  announced the unlimited
three-year loans Dec. 8.  At the three-way press conference in Strasbourg at the
time, Sarkozy said France agreed to stop pressuring the ECB to
step up its response to the debt crisis. “On institutions like
the ECB, it is true we don’t have the same history,” Sarkozy
said at the time. “When we say we won’t make comments, it has a
meaning. We’ve made a positive compromise here.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
