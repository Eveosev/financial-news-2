Following are comments on London Metal
Exchange rules for delivering industrial metals from stockpiles
and on aluminum demand by Philip Martens, chief executive
officer of Novelis Inc.  Martens spoke yesterday in an interview in Abu Dhabi.
Novelis, an Atlanta-based unit of  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) ,
recycles about 40 billion aluminum beverage cans a year,
according to its website.  On LME rules:  “The offloading rate that’s been introduced in April has a
small incremental benefit. There has to be some aggressive
offloading rate that has to be introduced.  “It’s hard to consider legal action. The only action we
really can take is to be vocal about what we see.  “You have that amount of  inventory  stockpiled, tied up in
financing arrangements, and then you have a backlog in demand
that really can use it. It’s just a misbalance right now.”  On demand:  “If you look at it globally, the U.S. probably has flat
demand except for the automotive sector.  Europe  is flat except
for the automotive sector, and there is an increase in beverage-
can usage for aluminum. The biggest demand, probably, that we
have is the broader Asian market.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
