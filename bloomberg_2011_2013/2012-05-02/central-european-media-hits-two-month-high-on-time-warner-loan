more than two months after saying Time Warner Inc. will provide
a $300 million loan and will raise its stake in the company.  CME, as the broadcaster is known, increased as much as 7.6
percent to 159 koruna, its strongest intraday price since Feb.
22, before paring the rally to 4.9 percent at 155 koruna by 9:52
a.m. in Prague. That made the stock the best performer today in
the 14-member  PX (PX)  equity index, which advanced 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
