The  International Monetary Fund  said
more work needs to be done before signing a $3.2 billion loan
with  Egypt , raising the possibility that the funds won’t be
delivered as soon as the Egyptian government had anticipated.  The IMF has said Egypt must submit an economic program
supported by political groups that will run the country after
the transition from military rule. Parliament, dominated by
Islamists who are calling for the military-appointed Cabinet to
be fired, voted against the government’s platform last month.  “There is still a little bit of work to be done to get to
the point where we could say to our board that this is a program
that has the kind of support that we could confidently feel will
lead to its implementation,”  Masood Ahmed , director of the
 Middle East  and Central Asia at the IMF, told a news conference
in Dubai today.  His remarks throw into question whether Egypt will sign the
IMF agreement by May 15, as announced by Finance Minister Momtaz El-Saieed last month. El-Saieed didn’t answer calls by Bloomberg
News seeking comment today.  Economists such as Raza Agha of the Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc say IMF support is necessary to rebuild investor
confidence in Egypt after the revolution that ousted  Hosni Mubarak  last year. The country has spent more than half its
 foreign currency reserves  since the start of 2011, and domestic
borrowing costs are close to a record high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
