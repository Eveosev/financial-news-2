Turk Telekomunikasyon AS (TTKOM) ,  Turkey ’s
biggest phone company, is seeking powers from shareholders to
allow its board to make acquisitions this year of as much as 300
million euros ($396 million) per transaction, the company said.  The board will ask an annual shareholders meeting scheduled
for May 25 to give it the powers, the Ankara-based company said
in a filing with the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  after the markets
closed on April 30.  The company is looking to expand in markets such as
entertainment and education, group Chief Executive Officer Hakam Kanafani said in an interview on April 24.  “Our eyes are open for any opportunities in the region,”
Kanafani said. “But this is a sellers’ market where assets are
highly leveraged and we are not under pressure to buy assets
that don’t justify price.”  Turk Telekom is watching opportunities in eastern  Europe 
and the  Middle East , the group CEO said.  The company bought units of Hungary’s Invitel Holding A/S
for about $275 million in 2010 to extend its fiber network from
the Middle East to  Germany . It’s seeking assets “that will have
synergies with Turkey,” Kanafani said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
