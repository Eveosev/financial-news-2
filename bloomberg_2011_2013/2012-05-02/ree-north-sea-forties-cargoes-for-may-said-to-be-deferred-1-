Three North Sea Forties crude cargoes
for loading in May were delayed by one to three days, bringing
total deferrals for this month to eight shipments, according to
three people with knowledge of the export program.  The shipment with parcel number F0512 will load from May
20, one day later than planned, and lot F0513 was also postponed
by one day to May 21, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the information is confidential. Cargo number
F0514 was deferred by three days to load from May 25, they said.  Most of the deferrals were made after a halt at the 200,000
barrel-a-day Buzzard oil field, the biggest contributor to the
Forties blend.  Nexen Inc. (NXY) , operator of the Buzzard deposit,
started pumping from the reserve on April 25 after shutting for
four days because of a fault at the fourth platform.  Forties is one of four grades that make up Dated Brent, the
benchmark grade used to price more than half of the world’s oil.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  Details of deferrals and cancellations of Forties cargoes
for loading in May are as follows and don’t include two lots
that were delayed from April to this month:  To contact the reporter on this story:
