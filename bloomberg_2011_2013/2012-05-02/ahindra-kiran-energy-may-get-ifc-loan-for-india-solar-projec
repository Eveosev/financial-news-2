Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , the biggest
Indian maker of sports-utility vehicles, and its partner Kiran
Energy Solar Power Pvt. may get $26 million from the investment
arm of the  World Bank  to build three electricity plants.  International Finance Corp.’s board is expected to meet on
May 30 to study a proposal to offer the rupee debt to Mahindra
Solar One, a joint venture 26 percent-held by Mahindra and 74
percent by Kiran, a proposal  summary  on IFC’s website shows.  The venture plans to build two 20-megawatt solar plants and
a 10-megawatt project in Rawra village, Rajasthan state, for
$105 million, according to the summary. It already operates a 5-
megawatt plant nearby, also partly IFC funded, with a power
transmission line that would be shared by the proposed projects.  Kiran, with investors including Bessemer Venture Partners,
is based in  Mumbai  and runs 20 megawatts of solar capacity in
Gujarat. Bessemer was an early funder of Skype Technologies SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
