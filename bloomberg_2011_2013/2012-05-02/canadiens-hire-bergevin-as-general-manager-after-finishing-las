Marc Bergevin has been named general
manager of the  Montreal Canadiens  following a year in which the
team with the most National Hockey League titles finished last
in the Eastern Conference.  Bergevin, 46, will be introduced at a news conference this
afternoon, Canadiens owner Geoff Molson said today on the team
website. A Montreal native, Bergevin spent the past seven years
in various roles within the front office of the  Chicago
Blackhawks .  Bergevin replaces Pierre Gauthier, who was fired in March
with five games remaining in the season. The Canadiens finished
31-35-16, the team’s worst record in eight years.  The Canadiens have won a record 23 Stanley Cup
championships since the NHL’s formation in 1917, 10 more than
the next-closest team, the  Toronto Maple Leafs . Montreal’s most
recent title came in 1993, the last time the team reached the
finals.  Bergevin played 20 seasons in the NHL as a defenseman for
eight different teams. In 1,191 career games he had 36 goals,
145 assists and 1,090 penalty minutes.  Following Bergevin’s retirement after the 2003-04 season,
he joined Chicago’s front office. In seven years with the
Blackhawks he served as assistant general manager, director of
player personnel, assistant coach and director of pro scouting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
