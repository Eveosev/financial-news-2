The Pecsi Tudomanyegyetem, Ferenc Gyurcsany’s alma mater, will examine the former prime minister’s
1984 thesis after media reports alleged it was plagiarized, MTI
state news service reported.  The southern Hungarian university has also asked the police
to investigate the disappearance of the thesis from its
archives, MTI said, citing a university official.  The probe comes a month after former President  Pal Schmitt 
resigned when Budapest-based Semmelweis university stripped him
of his doctorate in sports for having plagiarized his thesis 20
years ago. Schmitt was the first head of state to quit before
the end of his term since the country’s transition to democracy
in 1990.  To contact the reporter on this story:
