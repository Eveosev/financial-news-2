OAO Alrosa’s Catoca diamond mine in
 Angola  produced about 550,000 carats a month in the first
quarter, the  Angop  news service reported, citing the director of
the company’s joint venture in the country.  Catoca’s average output in the quarter was little changed
from the previous three months, Jose Ganga Jr. said, according
to the Luanda-based news agency.  Alrosa operates the mine near the northeastern town of
Saurimo. Its partners in the project include state-owned diamond
company Endiama EP and  Brazil ’s Odebrecht SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
