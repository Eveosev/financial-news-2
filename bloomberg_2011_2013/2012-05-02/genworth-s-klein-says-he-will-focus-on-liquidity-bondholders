Martin Klein, who was appointed
yesterday as acting chief executive officer of Genworth
Financial Inc., said he will concentrate on the insurer’s
liquidity after the departure of CEO Michael Fraizer.  “We will be very focused on executing the actions needed
to rebuild value for shareholders as well as bondholders,”
Klein said today in a conference call held by the Richmond,
Virginia-based insurer. “We’ll continue to meet the needs of
our customers while we improve the performance of our
businesses, maintain strong liquidity, and generate and manage
capital.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
