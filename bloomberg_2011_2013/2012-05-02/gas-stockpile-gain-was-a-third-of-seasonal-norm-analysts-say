U.S. natural-gas stockpiles increased
by 30 billion cubic feet last week, 38 percent of the seasonal
average, as weather extremes boosted demand, according to
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Inventories rose by 1.2 percent to 2.578 trillion in the
week ended April 27, based on the median of 17 estimates. The
five-year average increase for the week is 79 billion, according
to the Energy Department, which is scheduled to release its
weekly supply report tomorrow. The estimates ranged from gains
of 20 billion to 35 billion cubic feet.  Hot weather in  Texas  and below-average temperatures in the
Northeast and Midwest boosted demand for the power-plant and
heating fuel last week.  Dallas  saw a high on April 27 of 89
degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius), 10 above normal, according to
the National Weather Service. The low at  Chicago ’s  O’Hare
International Airport  that day was 35 degrees, 8 below normal.  “A lot more gas is being burnt than you’d expect in a
normal year, given the weather demand,” said Jonathan Arfa, an
analyst at Gelber & Associates in Houston. “The low price is
making gas very cheap to burn relative to coal.”  Natural gas futures last week gained 25.9 cents, or 13
percent, to $2.186 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . Gas today fell 5.9 cents, or 2.5
percent, to $2.312 at 1:24 p.m. Prices are down 23 percent this
year after settling at a decade low $1.907 on April 19.  Demand Outlook  Cooling demand across the U.S. was 4.7 percent above normal
during the week ended April 28, according to Weather
Derivatives.  Cooler weather boosted heating demand in the
Northeast to 34 percent above normal and to 7 percent above
normal in north-central states, data from the Belton, Missouri-
based forecaster show.  Temperatures will be normal or lower east of the  Rocky
Mountains  from May 8 through May 15 and above-normal along the
West Coast, according to the  National Weather Service .  A  surplus  of gas narrowed during the week ended April 20 to
55 percent above the five-year average for the week from a six-
year high of 61 percent at the end of March, Energy Department
data show.  Gas production in the lower 48 states fell to 72.32 billion
cubic feet a day in February from a revised 72.74 billion the
prior month, the department’s Energy Information Administration
said in its EIA-914 report on April 30.  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) , the second-largest gas producer in
the U.S. after  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , is “slowly ramping down gas
drilling” and reducing spending at gas plays,  Aubrey McClendon ,
chief executive officer of the company, said in a conference
call with analysts today.  Chesapeake will reduce its gas rig count to 12 within 90
days from 50 at the beginning of 2012, McClendon said.  The number of  rigs drilling  for gas across the U.S. dropped
by 18 last week to 613, the least since April 2002, data from
Baker Hughes Inc. show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
