Balda AG (BAF)  is looking for acquisitions
at its medical unit and has hired an adviser to help it with the
process,  Boersen-Zeitung  reported today, citing an interview
with Chief Executive Officer Dominik Mueser.  The company’s Electronic Products division will probably
report a profit in the fourth quarter of this year, Mueser said,
according to the German newspaper. If the unit’s restructuring
hasn’t succeeded by then, Balda doesn’t rule out divesting the
business, Mueser is cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
