Chinese stocks traded in the U.S.
rose, led by  Renren Inc. (RENN)  and  China Eastern Airlines Corp. (670) , as
the second manufacturing report this week signaled a rebound in
output for the world’s biggest exporter.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. rose 0.2 percent to 104.86 in New
York. Renren, a Chinese social networking website, jumped for a
second day as Facebook Inc. plans to begin marketing its initial
public offering, according to a person familiar with the matter.
 China Eastern  rose after saying it would buy 20  Boeing Co. (BA) 
planes.  The purchasing managers’ index in China, where the economy
grew at the slowest pace in four years last quarter, rose to
49.3 last month, according to data from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics, compared with an initial 49.1 reported on
April 23. A separate index released on May 1 in Beijing by
China’s statistics bureau indicated the quickest growth in a
year, while U.S. factory output climbed at the fastest pace in
10 months, another report showed.  “Industrial production has been better than expected and
U.S. growth has also picked up, which is good for China,”
Gabriel Wallach, who manages $2.5 billion in global assets as
chief investment officer at BNP Paribas Investment Partners in
Boston, said in a phone interview. “Those trends have been
positive” for Internet and consumer stocks, he said.  Wallach’s  Equity World Emerging (FOEQWEI)  fund has gained 16 percent
in 2012 compared to the  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  which has advanced 9.2
percent.  Melco Declines  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL)  dropped after a report
showed revenue for Macau’s gaming industry grew at the slowest
pace in more than two years in April and  Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128) , a unit
of billionaire Steve Wynn’s Las Vegas company, won a land grant
for its second resort in the Chinese city.  April revenue in Macau  rose 22 percent in April  from a year
earlier to 25 billion patacas ($3.1 billion), after rising 24
percent in March, the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau
said yesterday.  “We are seeing a clear deceleration trend,” said  Michael
Turner , an analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading LLC., who
has a sell recommendation. “Growth in Macau is closely tracking
property value. Any time you have a correction in the property
market, it will flow through the credit system and impact the
spending.”  Shares of Melco’s ADRs have more than tripled over the past
two years as gamblers from  China ’s mainland drive up revenue for
casino operators in Macau, the world’s biggest gaming hub and
the only place in the nation where casinos are legal.  Melco declined 2.8 percent to $15.15. Wynn Macau, traded in
Hong Kong, was unchanged yesterday at HK$24.90 ($3.21).  ‘Hope Among Investors’  Renren gained 4.3 percent to $6.60, extending its two-day
advance to 8.2 percent, the most since April 13. Renren is
benefiting from investor speculation that the Beijing-based
social networking site may partner with Facebook in China, said
Echo He, a New York-based analyst who covers Chinese Internet
stocks for Maxim Group LLC.  “There’s hope among some retail investors that Renren will
be acquired or get an investment from Facebook,” He said in a
phone interview. “Many investors trade on Internet names and
Facebook beginning a road show leads them to Renren. People
think of Renren as China’s Facebook.”  Maxim’s He has a sell  rating  on Renren.  China Eastern (CEA) , the nation’s second-biggest carrier, gained
2.7 percent in New York to $16.90 after shares rose 3.1 percent
in Hong Kong. The Shanghai-based company  said  April 30 that it
plans to buy 20 Boeing B777-300ERs for about $5.94 billion.  LDK Declines  LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , the world’s second-largest maker of wafers,
tumbled 7.1 percent to $2.87, its lowest close in New York since
Nov. 21. LDK has dropped 9.7 percent since it reported an
operating margin of minus 126.5 percent and a gross margin of
minus 65.5 percent due to a “significant” drop in prices,
according to the statement released April 30. Margins, a measure
of profitability, were positive a year ago.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., fell 0.1 percent to $38.31.
The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  slid 0.2 percent to 1,402.31 as
data showed companies added fewer jobs than economists projected
and euro-region unemployment rose to a 15-year high.  U.S. companies added 119,000 workers in April, the fewest
in seven months, according to figures from Roseland, New Jersey-
based ADP Employer Services. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 170,000 advance.
Joblessness in the 17-nation euro area increased to 10.9 percent
in March, the highest since April 1997, from 10.8 percent a
month earlier.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  gained 1.8 percent yesterday
to 2,438.44 after being closed for two days because of holidays.
The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies
traded in Hong Kong added 0.6 percent to a six-week high of
11,145.96.  To contact the reporters on this story:
