Citadel Capital SAE (CCAP) , a Cairo-based
private equity firm, headed for the biggest daily loss in more
than a month after the sale of its stake in National Petroleum
Co. Egypt Ltd. was postponed.  The shares of Citadel retreated 3.8 percent, the steepest
drop since March 25, to 3.04 Egyptian pounds, at 1:08 p.m. in
Cairo. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  fell 1 percent.  Canada’s  Sea Dragon Energy Inc. (SDX)  said April 30 it reached a
non-binding agreement with Golden Crescent Investments Ltd., a
unit of the Cairo-based private equity firm, to extend the  date
of its acquisition of Golden’s National Petroleum. The $147.5
million transaction has been delayed until Aug. 8. Golden has
the right to seek an alternative buyer by Aug. 1.  Citadel spokeswoman Ghada Hammouda didn’t answer a call and
a text message to her mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
