Praktiker AG (PRA) , Germany’s third-largest
home-improvement retailer, faces pressure from its largest
shareholders, who want the company to increase revenue at its
Max Bahr home-improvement chain,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing
Isabella de Krassny, a fund manager at Semper Constantia Privat
Bank AG.  De Krassny wants Praktiker to increase revenue at Max Bahr
in the coming three years to more than 55 percent from currently
about 33 percent, Handelsblatt said. Semper Constantia and its
investment vehicle Maseltov Ltd. are Praktiker’s biggest
shareholders.  -- Editor:  Chris Peterson   To contact the reporter on this story:
