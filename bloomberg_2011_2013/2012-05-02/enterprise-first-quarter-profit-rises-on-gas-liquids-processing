Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD) , the
biggest U.S. pipeline partnership, said first-quarter profit
rose as it transported and processed more natural gas liquids.  Net income rose to $656 million, or 73 cents a unit, from
$435 million, or 49 cents, a year earlier, the Houston-based
company said in a statement on Business Wire today. Excluding an
income tax benefit and other one-time items, per-share profit
beat the 57-cent average of 15  analysts’ estimate  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Production of natural gas liquids, or NGL, including
propane and butane, has grown as exploration companies seek more
profitable products while  gas prices  are at 10-year lows.  “In many plays, NGL is the ‘good roommate’ - paying the
rent so gas can live for free, generating little return while
eating Doritos and watching ‘Price is Right,’” Brad Olsen, an
analyst for Houston-based Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co., wrote in
an April 27 note to clients.  Enterprise owns 50,200 miles (80,800 kilometers) of
pipelines. About 40 percent of Enterprise’s  revenue  and 57
percent of its profit last year came from transporting and
processing gas liquids, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The earnings were released before the start of regular
trading on U.S. markets. Enterprise rose 0.2 percent to $51.69
in  New York  yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
