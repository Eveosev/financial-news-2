The  World Bank ’s private-sector
financing arm may provide a $14 million loan to Spain’s  Abengoa
SA (ABG)  for a factory in India to make equipment for solar-thermal
 power plants .  Inabensa Bharat Pvt., a wholly owned unit of the solar
developer, plans to build a plant near Vadodara in western
Gujarat state that will produce steel support structures for
cylindrical parabolic solar collectors and heliostats in solar-
thermal plants, according to a  summary  of the loan proposal on
the International Finance Corp. website.  The facility will have an annual capacity of 25,000 tons
and also produce steel structures for electricity transmission
and distribution projects. It plans to sell its output in India
and neighboring countries, the IFC said.  Solar-thermal technology harnesses sunlight to heat liquids
that produce steam for generators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
