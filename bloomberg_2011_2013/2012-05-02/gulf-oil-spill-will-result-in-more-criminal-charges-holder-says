Additional criminal charges related to
the 2010 Gulf of Mexico  oil spill  are likely, said U.S. Attorney
General Eric Holder.  “We expect there will be others,” Holder said today in
Washington. “I wouldn’t want to put a time frame on when
charges will be brought.”  Holder spoke in response to a reporter’s question at a news
conference about Medicare fraud.  A former  BP Plc (BP/)  engineer, Kurt Mix, was arrested on April
24 on charges of intentionally destroying evidence requested by
the U.S. about the size of the spill.  The charges filed against Mix were the first related to the
blowout and explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that
killed 11 workers and caused the worst offshore oil spill in
U.S. history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
