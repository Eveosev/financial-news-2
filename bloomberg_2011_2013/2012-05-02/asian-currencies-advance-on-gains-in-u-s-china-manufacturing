South Korea ’s won led an advance among
Asian currencies as reports showed a pickup in manufacturing in
the U.S. and  China  yesterday, brightening the outlook for
regional exports to the world’s two biggest economies.  The won closed at a one-month high and Malaysia’s ringgit
reached the strongest level in seven weeks as stocks indexes
across Asia rose. China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index climbed to
a one-year high of 53.3 in April from 53.1 in March, while the
Institute for Supply Management reported U.S. factory output
increased to 54.8, the highest since June. Thailand’s baht ended
a five-day rally after the Bank of Thailand kept borrowing costs
unchanged at its policy meeting today.  The manufacturing data were “very good for the export
outlook for  Asia  and that tends to lift the outlook for Asian
currencies,” said Sean Yokota, a Singapore-based currency
strategist at UBS AG.  The won gained 0.2 percent to 1,127.45 per dollar in Seoul
from April 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
ringgit appreciated to 3.0268 after touching 3.0208, a level
last seen on March 13. Taiwan’s dollar closed little changed at
NT$29.24 after hitting an eight-month high of NT$29.08.  The  MSCI Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares rose 0.5 percent as
stock exchange data showed foreign investors were net buyers of
equities in Indonesia, South Korea,  Philippines , Taiwan, and
Thailand in April. Most Asian markets were closed yesterday for
public holidays.  China PMI  “With the U.S. and Chinese manufacturing data, the overall
atmosphere is favorable for the won,” Lee Yong Hee, a Seoul-
based currency dealer at Industrial Bank of  Korea , said before
today’s release of a separate output index for China. “We see
more exporters selling the dollar than importers buying.”  HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics reported the
purchasing managers’ index of Chinese factory production
increased to 49.3 in April, compared with a preliminary reading
of 49.1 on April 23 and a final 48.3 in March. A level of 50 is
the dividing line between expansion and contraction.  China’s  yuan  gained the most in two weeks before a Sino-U.S.
strategic economic dialogue in Beijing tomorrow that may include
discussions on whether the Chinese currency is undervalued. It
appreciated 0.05 percent to 6.3070 per dollar in Shanghai.  Thai Rates  The baht fell 0.3 percent to 30.84 against the U.S.
currency in Bangkok, versus 30.75 on April 30, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Bank of  Thailand  kept its benchmark
one-day repurchase rate at  3 percent , as predicted by all 18
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Elsewhere, Indonesia’s rupiah dropped 0.1 percent to 9,199
per dollar and the Philippine peso rose 0.1 percent to 42.190.
India’s rupee declined 0.3 percent to 52.89.  To contact the reporters on this story:
