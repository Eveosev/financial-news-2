Spot gasoline on the U.S.  Gulf Coast 
fell to the lowest level against futures in seven weeks after
the Energy Department said regional inventories jumped 2.3
percent last week.  Gasoline supplies  dropped in every U.S. region last week
except for the Gulf Coast, known as Padd 3, where stocks grew by
1.63 million barrels to 71.6 million, the report showed.
 Refinery utilization  in the region climbed 0.3 percentage points
to 84.3 percent in the week ended April 27.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast widened 0.75 cent to 18.63 cents a gallon to futures
traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 4:08 p.m. East
Coast time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
lowest level for the fuel in the Gulf Coast since March 12.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  was starting units at the 135,000-
barrel-a-day Meraux refinery in  Louisiana  after a “power blip”

 San Antonio , said in an e-mail. The incident should have “no
material impact” on production, he said.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  was depressuring a hydrocracker at the
584,000-barrel-a-day Baytown refinery in  Texas  after the unit
“tripped,” a filing with the U.S. National Response Center
showed. The incident should have “minimal impact” on
production, Connie Tilton, an Exxon spokeswoman at the refinery,
said in an e-mail.  New York  The same fuel in New York Harbor weakened 2.75 cents to
8.25 cents a gallon below gasoline futures at 3:58 p.m. East
Coast time.  Unleaded gasoline in the Midwest, or Group 3, was unchanged
at a discount of 14.75 cents a gallon versus futures.  Conventional gasoline to be blended with ethanol, or CBOB,
in  Chicago  fell 1 cent to 3.5 cents a gallon below futures.  BP Plc (BP/) ’s 160,000-barrel-a-day Toledo refinery in  Ohio 
flared sulfur dioxide yesterday after a relief valve lifted on
the EPA wash tower, a notice to the Toledo Division of
Environmental Quality showed.  BP’s 420,000-barrel-a-day Whiting refinery in  Indiana  fixed
a pump malfunction that prevented it from delivering products on
the West Shore pipeline near Chicago, said Kevin Good, a
Houston-based spokesman for  Buckeye Partners LP (BPL) , which operates
the line.  To contact the reporter on this story:
