Norwegian manufacturing expanded less
than estimated in April, dropping to the lowest level since
December, as  Europe ’s debt crisis weighs on orders.  A seasonally adjusted  index  based on responses from
purchasing managers fell to 53.7 in April from a revised 59.3 in
March, Oslo-based Fokus Bank said today. The median estimate of
six economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for the index to fall
to 57. A reading above 50 signals an expansion.  Norway’s central bank in March lowered its  main interest
rate  for a second time since December to shield the economy from
the  European debt crisis  and curb excessive krone gains.  The sub-index measuring orders fell to 56.8 from 63.8 and
the production measure decreased to 55.1 from 59.1, according to
the survey. The employment index dropped to 52.1 from 61.  Norway ’s PMI Index was started by Fokus Bank in 2004 in
cooperation with the Association for Purchasing and Logistics.
Fokus is owned by Danske Bank A/S, Denmark’s biggest lender.  In neighboring  Sweden , the PMI for April was unchanged at
50.2, Stockholm-based Swedbank AB, which compiles the index,
said in an e-mail today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
