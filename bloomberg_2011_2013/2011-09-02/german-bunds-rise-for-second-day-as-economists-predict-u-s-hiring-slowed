German bonds rose, pushing the 10-
year yield to a record low, as U.S. job growth stalled, fueling
demand for the safest assets as signals mount that the world’s
largest economy is headed toward recession.  Italian and Spanish bonds retreated, while Greek two-year
yields soared to a record. U.S. employers added no jobs in
August, the weakest reading since September 2010, after an
85,000 increase a month earlier, the Labor Department reported
today. Italy’s 10-year bonds dropped for a 10th day, a record
streak, amid pessimism over the nation’s ability to implement
fiscal reforms.  “The U.S. jobs data has given another lift to Treasuries
and bunds,” said  John Davies , a fixed-income strategist at
WestLB AG in London. “This exacerbates fears that we’re not
just slowing down in growth, but may be sliding toward
recession. It’s bad news for the peripheral markets, which
remain under pressure.”  Ten-year bund yields dropped 13 basis points to 2.01
percent at 4:31 p.m. in London, after falling to 1.996 percent,
the lowest since at least 1999. The 2.25 percent security
maturing in September 2021 rose 1.18, or 11.80 euros per 1,000-
euro ($1,421) face amount, to 102.115. The two-year note yield
dropped 10 basis points to 0.54 percent after declining to 0.52
percent, the least since June 18, 2010.  Bund Futures  German 10-year bund futures climbed to a record. The
contract expiring in September rose as much as 1.2 percent to
136.97 before settling at 136.74.  Bunds rose yesterday as data showed euro-area manufacturing
shrank more than initially estimated in August.  Europe ’s economy
is cooling as governments enact spending cuts to narrow their
budget deficits, sapping consumers’ willingness to spend.  Ten-year German yields dropped 32 basis points last month
as investors sought the safety of government debt, spooked by
plunging stocks. The safest bonds were also lifted as the
 Federal Reserve  pledged on Aug. 9 to keep borrowing costs near
zero until mid-2013.  Italian 10-year yields climbed 13 basis points to 5.28
percent, the highest level since Aug. 9. The nation’s two-year
note yield added 11 basis points to 3.52 percent.  The 10-year Italian spread over German bunds widened 25
basis points to 327 basis points, the most since Aug. 8, when
the ECB began buying  Italy ’s debt. Costs to insure Italian bonds
using credit-default swaps surged to a record 398 basis points,
according to CMA.  Trichet, Berlusconi  Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  on Aug. 29 agreed to
overhaul the 45 billion-euro austerity plan of Aug. 5, which had
helped persuade the ECB to start buying Italy’s bonds. While the
full impact of the changes remain unclear, Berlusconi dropped a
tax on the highest earners and limited funding cuts to regional
governments.  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said
Italy must confirm its commitment to deficit reduction. European
stocks tumbled, paced by banks.  The Aug. 5 plan is of “extreme importance” and must be
“fully confirmed and substantiated,” Trichet said in an
interview with  Il Sole 24 Ore  published today.  Spain’s 10-year bond yields rose eight basis points to 5.13
percent as a report showed unemployment grew in August, while
the two-year yield jumped four basis points to 3.54 percent.  Registered unemployment in Spain, which has the highest
jobless rate in Europe, expanded for the first time in five
months, the nation’s labor ministry said today. The number of
people signing up for benefits climbed 51,185 to 4.13 million.  ‘Nasty’ Unemployment  “Spanish unemployment was nasty, there’s zero progress on
a second bail out for  Greece  -- the ECB needs to be jumping back
in to the market more aggressively,” Davies said.  Investors demanded more than three percentage points of
extra yield to hold  Spain ’s 10-year bonds instead of their
German counterparts, the first time the spread reached that
level since the ECB started buying Spanish debt almost a month
ago. The spread widened to as much as 3.11 percentage points.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 3 percent, snapping a four-
day rally, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 1.6
percent.  The ECB has restrained Italian and Spanish borrowing costs
by buying bonds in the secondary market over the past three
weeks after contagion from the debt crisis sent both nations’
10-year yields to euro-era records at the start of August.  Greek notes headed for their sixth weekly decline. Two-year
yields soared as much as 436 basis points, or 4.36 percentage
points, to 47.29 percent.  “Investors are taking risk bets off the table, and that’s
pressuring peripheral bonds,” said  Michael Markovic , a senior
fixed-income strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich.
“Markets have priced in sluggish global growth and are
struggling to see what’s coming next.”  German  government bonds  have returned 5.7 percent this
year, while Treasuries gained 7.7 percent, according to indexes
compiled by the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies and Bloomberg. Spanish bonds have returned 4.8 percent
and Italy’s have lost 0.4 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
