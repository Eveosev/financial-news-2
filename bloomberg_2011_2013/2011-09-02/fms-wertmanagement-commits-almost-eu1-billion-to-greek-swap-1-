FMS Wertmanagement, the so-called
bad bank in charge of winding down assets from  Hypo Real Estate 
Holding AG, will participate in a sovereign-debt swap aimed at
reducing Greece’s debt load.  FMS, which is fully owned by the German state, will swap 13
bonds with a nominal volume of 975 million euros ($1.39
billion), it said in a statement today. Those bonds, which have
a maturity date before 2020, qualify for the swap of longer
maturity debt offered by the Greek government, FMS said.  Munich-based FMS is in charge of winding down about 176
billion euros in assets of Hypo Real Estate. The German
commercial property lender almost collapsed during the financial
crisis when the lender’s Dublin-based Depfa Bank Plc unit
couldn’t raise financing in the wake of the bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., which froze credit markets.  FMS holds a total of 8.76 billion euros of Greek loans and
bonds, it said today.  “We expect that this measure will result in a
stabilization,” said Christian Bluhm, the FMS management board
member responsible for credit risks. “This helps to
significantly increase the prospects for full repayment of the
remaining Greek bonds in our portfolio.”  The  Institute of International Finance  said on Aug. 31 it
expects rising bank participation in the debt swap that’s part
of a new rescue plan for  Greece . Forty financial institutions
have explicitly lent their support to the debt exchange, a key
element of the 159 billion-euro rescue program that European
leaders crafted in July, the IIF said at the time.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
