Ghana ’s cedi fell for a fifth day
against the dollar, its longest losing streak in seven months,
as manufacturing companies bought the U.S. currency to import
raw materials.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated as much as 0.1 percent to 1.5290 per dollar before
trading less than 0.1 percent down at 1.5285 per dollar as of
3:04 p.m. in Accra, the capital, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, extending its first weekly drop in three to 0.3
percent.  “The cedi weakened today amid dollar buying by
manufacturing companies,” Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader at
the local unit of Barclays Bank Plc, said in a telephone
interview. “A recovery in corporate demand for dollars this
week, as compared to last week was largely responsible for the
losses witnessed in the cedi this week.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
