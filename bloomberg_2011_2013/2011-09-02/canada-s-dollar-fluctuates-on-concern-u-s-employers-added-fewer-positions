Canada ’s dollar fluctuated between
gains and losses versus the greenback before a government report
forecast to show the  U.S. economy  added fewer jobs in August.  The currency, also known as the loonie, has underperformed
the Australian and New Zealand dollars this week on concern the
U.S., Canada’s largest trading partner, may be headed for
another recession. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. cut its
forecast for the Canadian dollar, which was trading within a
cent of a four-week high.  “It’s more a reflection of the deteriorating outlook for
the U.S. economy,” said  Lee Hardman , a currency strategist at
Bank of Tokyo, by phone from  London , whose firm predicts the
currency will depreciate to C$1.02 per  U.S. dollar  by the end of
the year, compared with an August forecast of 95 cents. “For
our forecast to be right, we need to see harder evidence the
U.S. is heading to recession.”  The Canadian currency was little changed at 97.79 cents per
U.S. dollar at 7:57 a.m. in Toronto, compared with 97.69 cents
yesterday. It rallied two days ago to 97.25 cents, the strongest
level since Aug. 4. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0227.  The loonie was headed for a gain of 0.4 percent this week
in what would be a second consecutive advance after four
straight weeks of decline.  U.S. payrolls rose by 68,000 in August, down from an
increase of 117,000 in July, according to the median forecast of
86 economists in a Bloomberg News survey before today’s Labor
Department report. The  unemployment rate  held at 9.1 percent,
marking 26 out of the last 28 months in which it has been at or
above 9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
