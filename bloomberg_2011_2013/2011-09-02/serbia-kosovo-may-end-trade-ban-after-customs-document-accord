Serbia and  Kosovo  may end a trade
ban after Serb officials said they’ll accept status-neutral
documents for products from Kosovo in an agreement brokered by
the European Union, negotiators said.  Under the compromise, Serbia will recognize stamps on
documents that say “Kosovo Customs” without any state insignia
such as the Kosovo flag or coat-of-arms, Borislav Stefanovic,
Serbia’s chief negotiator, said in a telephone interview. The
head of Kosovo’s negotiating team, Edita Tahiri, said on Radio-
Televizija Srbije  television  that the “breakthrough agreement”
will enable free flow of goods.  The accord was reached in Brussels today where the two
sides met under the EU auspices. Stefanovic said trade may
resume in about a week.  An EU statement said “as a result the mutual trade
embargoes will be lifted. This is an important step in improving
relations in the region and ensuring freedom of movement of
goods in accordance with European values.”  The dispute stemmed from  Serbia ’s refusal to recognize
Kosovo as a state. A former province of Serbia, Kosovo declared
independence in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
