Oil erased its decline in  New York 
after a tropical depression formed in the Gulf of Mexico,
shutting production platforms.  Crude for October delivery was unchanged at $88.93 a barrel
in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange after
earlier falling as much as 31 cents. The contract yesterday
climbed 12 cents to settle at the highest level in four weeks as
the weather system developed.  The tropical depression has shut nearly 6 percent of the
region’s oil output and could approach the southern coast of
Louisiana this weekend, according to the National Hurricane
Center. The system, about 225 miles (360 kilometers) southwest
of the Mississippi River mouth, is traveling northwest at 6
miles per hour and may strengthen into a tropical storm before
reaching  Louisiana ’s coast Sept. 3, the Miami-based center said
in an advisory issued before 8 p.m. East Coast time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
