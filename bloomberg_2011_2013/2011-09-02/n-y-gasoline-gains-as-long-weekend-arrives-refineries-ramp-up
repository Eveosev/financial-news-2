New York  spot gasoline strengthened
to the highest level against futures in almost three years as
the U.S. Labor Day weekend arrived and as  ConocoPhillips (COP) ’s
Bayway refinery in  New Jersey  resumed normal operations.  The 238,000-barrel-a-day plant was shut on Aug. 27 as
Hurricane Irene approached, according to a statement on the
company’s website.  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  has also started a crude unit at
its Philadelphia refinery that was shut Aug. 28 because of
flooding from Irene, according to a person familiar with the
plant’s operations. The Labor Day weekend is the traditional end
of the U.S. summer driving season.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor, rose 0.63 cent to 25.13 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:05 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery slipped
5.28 cents to $3.0849 a gallon.  Issues ranging from flooding to power outages from Irene
also resulted in the shutdown of some pipeline operations.
Colonial Pipeline Co., the largest line linking the U.S. Gulf
Coast to Northeast markets, allocated a shipping cycle on its
gasoline mainline after temporarily shutting some segments.  Separately, Colonial shut and later restarted its mainlines
3 and 4 yesterday, which carry gasoline and distillate fuels
north of Greensboro,  North Carolina , and some smaller lines in
Virginia after a 3.4-magnitude aftershock in Central Virginia,
the company said in an e-mail statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
