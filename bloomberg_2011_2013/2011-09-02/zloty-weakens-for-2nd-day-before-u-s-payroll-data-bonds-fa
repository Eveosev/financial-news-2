The Polish zloty slid the most in
two weeks after a report showed American employers added no jobs
in August, raising concern that the global economy is slowing.  The zloty depreciated 1 percent to 4.1829 per euro as of
5:33 p.m. in Warsaw, the biggest intraday decline since Aug. 18.
It has lost 0.9 percent this week, the third steepest drop after
 Hungary ’s forint and the Czech koruna among more than 20
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The zloty slid
2.7 percent to 3.7463 per Swiss franc. The yield on notes
maturing in April 2016 rose two basis points to 4.98 percent.  U.S. payrolls were unchanged last month, the weakest
reading since September 2010 and worse than the median economist
forecast that called for growth of 68,000, according to Labor
Department data. The zloty depreciated 3.2 percent in August
against the euro, its worst month in more than a year, amid
concern the global economic recovery is faltering.  “After monthly data from the U.S. labor market, the
concerns about the global economic outlook may strengthen,”
Bank Zachodni WBK SA economists led by Maciej Reluga in Warsaw
wrote in a weekly report to clients. “This will limit the
potential for zloty strengthening.”  Commerzbank AG on July 29 reduced its forecast for the
zloty through the end of next year, citing the global economic
slowdown and “risks” related to Swiss franc-denominated loans.
The zloty will strengthen to 4 per euro at the end of 2011, from
3.85 estimated earlier, Thu Lan Nguyen, an analyst at the bank
in  Frankfurt , wrote in a report today.  The zloty slipped for a fourth day against the franc to the
weakest level on a closing basis in three weeks. The total value
of franc-denominated home loans in  Poland  reached 151.8 billion
zloty ($51.9 billion) at the end of June and represented 53
percent of all mortgages outstanding, according to the financial
market regulator’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
