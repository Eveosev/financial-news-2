What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that the
government will cut its forecast for the U.S. harvest later this
month after hot, dry weather damaged plants, Chad Henderson, a
market analyst for Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in
Brookfield, Wisconsin, said in a telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago on bets that dry weather this month in parts of the
Midwest reduced the size of beans in pods, cutting U.S. yield
potential, Henderson said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to
open up 0.25 cent to 0.35 cent a pound, and soybean-meal futures
may open steady to $1 lower for 2,000 pounds of the  animal feed .  -- Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as widespread  drought  across most of the southern
U.S. Great Plains threatens to delay or prevent planting of
winter crops, Henderson said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
