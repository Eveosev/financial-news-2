U.S. Gulf crude premiums
strengthened after the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate’s
discount to Brent widened.  The gap between WTI and Brent October contracts increased
$1.45 to $26.81 a barrel at 1:25 p.m. in  New York . The spread
settled Aug. 19 at a record margin of $26.21.  When Brent increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased 20 cents to
$27.20 over benchmark West Texas Intermediate at 12:10 p.m. in
New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet’s premium was unchanged at $30 a barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added 60 cents to $25.50 while Poseidon strengthened 70
cents to $25.30 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium added 50 cents to $23.50 a
barrel. West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 5 cents to 70 cents
below WTI. Thunder Horse’s premium increased 80 cents to $27.50
above the benchmark.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $10 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$11.25 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
