     Sept. 2 (Bloomberg) -- Novartis AG (NOVN)  sees growth opportunities
for its Alcon eye-care unit in emerging markets and the advanced
implant-lens business, Reuters reported, citing an interview
with Chief Executive Officer Joseph Jimenez.  Alcon should be able to grow more than 5 percent a year in
the long term and will benefit from Novartis’s presence in
Russia, China, India and Brazil, Jimenez was quoted as saying by
Reuters. The company would consider acquisitions between $1
billion and $2 billion to expand Alcon’s offering to mid-priced
products, he said, according to Reuters.  The strength of the Swiss franc is not a “short-term
phenomenon,” and the CEO is taking “a hard look” at the
company’s cost base in  Switzerland , Reuters reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
