The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate debt rose, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed eight
basis points to 724, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 7:30
a.m. in  London . An increase signals worsening perceptions of
 credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was up 2.5 at 176.5 basis points.
The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers increased four basis points to 268.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.9 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
