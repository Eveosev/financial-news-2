The Ghana Stock Exchange, whose
composite index has climbed 14 percent this year, plans to
distribute stock to members before selling shares to the public
by 2013, Managing Director Kofi Yamoah said.  “We would see the exchange listing its own shares on the
market like the Johannesburg and London stock exchanges,” he
said in a phone interview today from Accra, the capital,
declining to provide a specific timeframe. “The long-term plan
is to open ownership to the public.”  Demutualization will make the bourse a profit-seeking
entity for its shareholders, Yamoah said. Shares will first be
offered to brokerage firms, listed companies and associate
members before they are opened to the public, he said.  The 34-member index’s gain this year makes it sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s best-performing gauge together with Botswana and
Zambia’s measures, which have also advanced 14 percent. The
increases compare with a 16 percent drop in the MSCI Frontier
Markets Index over the same period.  The bourse will introduce an exchange-traded fund, linked
to the price of gold, by the end of the year, Yamoah said.  “We want to reposition the market in the eyes of policy
makers, entrepreneurs and multinationals to bring new products
and instruments to trade,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
