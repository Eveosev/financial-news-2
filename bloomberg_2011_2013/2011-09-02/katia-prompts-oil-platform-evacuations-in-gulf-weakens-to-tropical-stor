Tropical Storm Lee strengthened in
the  Gulf of Mexico  as it moved north toward  Louisiana ’s coast,
shutting as much as half the oil production in the Gulf of
Mexico and a third of natural gas output.  Lee is about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south-southeast of
Intracoastal City, Louisiana, heading north-northwest at 7 miles
per hour and “producing heavy rains” over the south of the
state, the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory before
8 a.m. East Coast time. The storm’s maximum sustained winds
strengthened to 60 mph with “some slight” strengthening
possible before it makes landfall, according to the Miami-based
center’s forecast.  “This will be an extensive, slow-moving system, capable of
affecting the same area for days with downpours, stormy seas and
rough surf conditions,” said Alex Sosnowski, an AccuWeather
Inc. meteorologist, on the  State College , Pennsylvania-based
forecaster’s website. “Considering potential for damage, impact
to the  petroleum industry  and commerce in the Gulf Coast region,
the system could be the next billion-dollar disaster.”  Companies including Anadarko Petroleum Corp., BP Plc, Exxon
Mobil Corp. and Noble Corp. evacuated workers from Gulf rigs and
platforms. About 47.6 percent of Gulf oil production and 33
percent of natural gas output has been shut by the storm,
according to the  Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation
and Enforcement .  Gulf Output  The Gulf accounts for 27 percent of U.S. oil output and 6.5
percent of natural gas production. As much as 91 percent of gas
and 98 percent of oil output in the Gulf may be shut in the next
five days, according to  Kinetic Analysis Corp. , a  Silver Spring ,
Maryland-based company that predicts the effects of disasters.  Oil and natural gas producers will be watching wind speeds
and wave heights to determine whether and how long to shut
operations, said Jan Vermeiren, chief executive officer of
Kinetic Analysis. All production affected so far has been the
result of precautionary measures, he said.  “Neither wind nor wave should cause much damage at this
point,” Vermeiren said.  Jim Shugart, executive vice president for sales and
marketing  North America  at ERA Helicopters LLC, said his company
may return workers to rigs and platforms today.  “We’re going to start putting people back out if this
weather doesn’t circle on us,” Shugart said in a telephone
interview from  Lake Charles , Louisiana. “In a situation like
this, you start putting people back out the minute you can.”  Hurricane Gustav  Lee isn’t strong enough to cause any significant damage to
energy assets at this point, said James Williams, an economist
at WTRG Economics, an energy research firm in  London ,  Arkansas .  “We’re not talking about Hurricane Gustav here, moving
pipelines up and down Louisiana like it was spaghetti,”
Williams said in a telephone interview. “This one isn’t a big
story. It’s a wet story.” Gustav struck in 2008.  Ten to 15 inches (25 to 38 centimeters) of rain is expected
to fall over southern Louisiana,  Mississippi  and  Alabama , with
as much as 20 inches in some areas, according to the hurricane
center. The  Florida Panhandle  may see as much as eight inches of
rain through tomorrow, the center said.  The center of Lee is expected to “cross the Louisiana
coast this afternoon or tonight, then slowly cross southern
Louisiana on Sunday,” the hurricane center said.  Heavy Rain  Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour declared a state of
emergency in several counties expected to be hit with heavy rain
and floods as Lee nears.  “Do not underestimate the impact of this system of
tropical weather,” Barbour said in a statement on his website.
“Make preparations now to protect your family and your
property.”  Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal declared a state of
emergency, saying the storm threatens “extremely heavy,
prolonged” rain over the state and may cause flash flooding and
high tides.  A tropical storm warning was posted for the northern  Gulf
coast  from the border of Alabama and Florida westward to Sabine
Pass,  Texas , including  New Orleans .  Ten Louisiana parishes declared states of emergency, and
officials urged voluntary evacuations in parts of Lafourche
Parish and Grand Isle, Jindal told a news conference yesterday.  “Get ready for the wind and get ready for the rain,”
Jindal said. “It’s coming, and it’s going to be here for a
while.”  Katia Progress  New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu extended a state of
emergency he declared earlier this week after a fire broke out
in the eastern part of the city.  In the Atlantic, Katia regained hurricane status after a
brief dip in strength. The storm was 530 miles east of the
northern Leeward Islands, and moving toward the northwest at 10
mph with top winds of 75 mph, the center said  an advisory  before
5 a.m. today.  “Some slow strengthening is possible this weekend,”
according to the center. Katia is the 11th named storm of the
 Atlantic hurricane season  that runs from June through November.  It’s too soon to tell where Katia will go, although
residents of the Bahamas and the U.S. East Coast “should not
let their guard down just yet,” said Kristina Pydynowksi, a
senior AccuWeather meteorologist.  To contact the reporters on this story:
