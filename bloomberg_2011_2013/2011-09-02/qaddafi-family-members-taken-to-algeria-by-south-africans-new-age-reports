Some members of Muammar Qaddafi’s
family were taken to  Algeria  from  Libya  by a team of 35 former
South African special forces operatives who were paid $15,000
each for the operation, Johannesburg’s New Age newspaper said,
citing an unidentified person who was asked to take part in the
mission but declined.  The men were recruited in Johannesburg after interviews at
a hotel, the newspaper said, citing a copy of a letter sent to a
former South African special forces operative inviting him for
an interview.  Algeria said Qaddafi’s wife Safia, a daughter and two sons
arrived in the country on Aug. 29 and were granted exile.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
