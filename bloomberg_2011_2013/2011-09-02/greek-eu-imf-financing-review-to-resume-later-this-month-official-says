European Union and International
Monetary Fund officials conducting a review of  Greece ’s progress
under an international financing plan will return to  Athens  in
10 days’ time, a Greek finance ministry official said.  The first cycle of talks in the review has been completed
and the so-called troika will return in 10 days to continue the
inspection, said the official, who declined to be named. He said
the meetings were conducted in a “very positive” climate and
denied reports the inspection has been suspended due to
disagreements over covering a budget financing gap.  To contact the reporter on this story:
