U.S. consumer bankruptcies fell
11 percent in August compared with the same month last year,
continuing a trend that began as early as January, the  American
Bankruptcy Institute  reported.  Consumers filed 113,432 bankruptcies last month, compared
with 127,028 in August 2010, Alexandria, Virginia-based ABI said
in a statement today.  “Consumer bankruptcies continue to decline over the past
year as households deleverage and  consumer credit  remains
tight,” ABI Executive Director Samuel J. Gerdano said in the
statement.  August filings were slightly lower than the month before,
when 113,470 consumer cases were filed. ABI compiles statistics
on consumer bankruptcies every month from data supplied by the
National Bankruptcy Research Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
