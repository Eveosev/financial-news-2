Cameroon,  Africa ’s fourth-biggest
cocoa producer, plans to spend 175 billion CFA francs ($379
million) on constructing roads over the next 10 years.  The central African nation will build 350 kilometers (217
miles) of roads each year, Francois Felix Ewane, technical
inspector at the Ministry of Public Works, said in an interview
in Yaounde, the capital, today.  Cameroon’s roads, of which 5,000 kilometers or 10 percent
are paved, are degrading as traffic increases an average of 5
percent each year, according to the ministry. Only 6 percent of
roads are said to be in a good state, 21 percent are classified
as normal, while 70 percent are mediocre and 3 percent in a very
poor state, the ministry’s statistics showed.  The routes will be built around the country, including in
the cocoa-producing south, center and east regions. Cameroon
follows  Ivory Coast , Ghana and  Nigeria  as the continent’s top
cocoa growers. It also produces robusta and arabica coffee for
export.  To contact the reporter on this story:
