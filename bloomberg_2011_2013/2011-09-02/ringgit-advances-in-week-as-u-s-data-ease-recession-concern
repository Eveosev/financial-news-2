Malaysia’s ringgit completed its
biggest weekly gain since July, after better-than-expected U.S.
manufacturing and spending data eased concern a recovery in the
world’s largest economy is stalling. Bonds advanced.  The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s factory index
was 50.6 last month, more than the 48.5 forecast by economists
in a Bloomberg survey, data showed yesterday. A reading above 50
signals expansion. A government report earlier in the week
showed  consumer spending  climbed 0.8 percent in July, more than
the 0.5 percent predicted by economists in a Bloomberg poll.
Malaysia shipped 8.4 percent of its exports to the U.S. in the
first half of this year, official figures show.  “The market continues to look at U.S. and European data
for signals and on balance, it’s still not conclusive we are
going to get a global recession,” said Wong Kah Guan, a
currency forwards trader at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala
Lumpur. “Asian central banks may keep policy rates on hold and
not cut so soon,” preserving the yield advantage of regional
assets, he said.  The ringgit rose 0.7 percent this week to 2.9675 per dollar
as of 4:40 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , from 2.9888 on Aug. 26,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It advanced 0.5 percent
today from its Aug. 29 close, the last day of trading before
local financial markets shut for a three-day holiday.  Fund Inflows  Foreign investors boosted their holdings of ringgit-
denominated debt by 1.1 percent in July to 186.5 billion ringgit
($62.8 billion) from June, according to  data  published by the
central bank on its website on Aug. 26. Their holdings of
 government bonds  increased 4.1 percent, the figures showed.  Malaysia’s five-year government bonds rose today, pushing
their yield to the lowest level this year. The  finance ministry 
is scheduled to auction five- and seven-year bonds this month.  The yield on the 4.262 percent notes due September 2016
fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, this week to
3.34 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. The price jumped
0.22, or 2.2 ringgit per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to 104.22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
