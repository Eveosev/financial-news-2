Cattle futures rose the most in
three weeks on speculation that U.S. beef demand will rebound as
grocers replenish supplies after the Labor Day holiday weekend.
Hogs also gained.  Wholesale-beef prices tracked by the government were down
2.5 percent this week, as of midday, a sign that retail buyers
had finished stockpiling meat before Labor Day on Sept. 5, when
outdoor grilling is popular in the U.S., according to Troy Vetterkind, the owner of Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage. Wholesale
beef is up 11 percent from a year ago, and retail prices were at
a record in July, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  “When we come back from the holiday, we’re going to run
into tighter fed-cattle supplies, better beef demand and usage
going into the fall,” Vetterkind said in a telephone interview
from  Chicago . “You can make a case for being friendly the
cattle market.”  Cattle futures for October delivery rose 1.2 cents, or 1.1
percent, to settle at $1.148 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, the biggest gain since Aug. 11. The
commodity, down 0.3 percent for the week, has risen 6 percent
this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement advanced 0.175
cent, or 0.1 percent, to $1.3295 a pound in Chicago.  Hog futures for December settlement rose 1.1 cents, or 1.3
percent, to 83.1 cents on the CME. While the contract slipped
1.7 percent for the week, the fourth straight decline, the price
of the most-active futures are up 4.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
