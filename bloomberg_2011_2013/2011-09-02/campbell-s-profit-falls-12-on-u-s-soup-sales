Campbell Soup Co. (CPB) , the world’s
biggest soup maker, said fourth-quarter profit declined 12
percent after U.S. soup, sauce and beverage sales dropped.  Net income fell 12 percent to $100 million, or 31 cents a
share, in the period ended July 31, from $113 million, or 33
cents, a year earlier, the Camden, New Jersey-based company said
today in a statement. Excluding some items, earnings of 43 cents
topped the 38-cent average of 16 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Denise Morrison, who took over from
Doug Conant last month, plans to introduce new soups after
Campbell products failed to lure as many consumers as expected
during the economic slowdown and struggled to attract younger
customers. The company will debut 27 soup products this fiscal
year, up from three the year before.  “Soup volumes and consumption were softer this quarter,”
Morrison said on a conference call today. “While we expect
further volume declines, we will be competitive.”  Campbell fell 40 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $31.46 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have declined 9.5 percent this year.  The company forecast profit for fiscal 2012, excluding some
items, may fall as much as 7 percent to $2.36, compared with the
average analysts’ estimate of $2.37. In July, it predicted 2012
earnings would decline as much as 6 percent from the year prior.  U.S. soup sales fell 9 percent in the quarter after the
company advertised less and raised prices to help offset food
inflation. Revenue from the global baking and snacking unit
jumped 17 percent, helped by gains from Goldfish snack crackers,
Milano cookies, and the impact of currency swings.  Sales Rise  Campbell, along with other food makers, has increased its
prices on certain items after costs for raw ingredients such as
grain rose. Food  inflation  may be as much as 4 percent in 2011,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  predicted last month.  Fourth-quarter sales increased 5.9 percent to $1.61
billion, as currency translation added 5 percent, Campbell said.
Analysts estimated $1.57 billion on average. Net income included
costs related to cutting jobs, exiting the Russian market and
improving supply-chain efficiency.  The maker of Chunky brand soup has struggled to decrease
sodium levels in its food while preserving taste. In fiscal
2012, Campbell will shift sodium-reduction research spending to
focus on a “broader range of consumer benefits, notably taste
and satiety,” Morrison said in July.  Campbell also makes V8 juice and Prego pasta sauce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
