Canadian natural gas fell as a
tropical storm in the  Gulf of Mexico  is forecast to sap heat
from the U.S. Southwest and temperatures tumble in regions that
consume imported gas.  In Houston, where temperatures recorded by the  National
Weather Service  hit 107 degrees Fahrenheit (39 Celsius) Aug. 29,
a new mark for the date, cooling demand will trail normal by 22
percent for the next week, according to forecaster Weather
Derivatives.  Chicago ’s high will be 69 Fahrenheit on Sept. 5, 10
degrees cooler than normal, said AccuWeather Inc.  “Prices everywhere are being pressured by the storm in the
Gulf which is dropping the extreme temperatures in the
Southwest,” said Carl Neill, an energy consultant with Risk
Management Inc. in Atlanta.  Alberta  gas for October dropped 15.75 cents, or 4.4
percent, to C$3.45 per gigajoule ($3.32 per million British
thermal units) as of 3:15 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX, 
a Canadian Internet market. Gas traded on the exchange is
shipped to users in  Canada  and the U.S., and is priced on
TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Gas for October delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 17.8 cents, or 4.4 percent, to settle at $3.872

TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.7 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.43 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.33 billion cubic feet today, about 48
percent of its capacity of 2.76 billion.  The volume on Spectra Energy’s British Columbia system,
