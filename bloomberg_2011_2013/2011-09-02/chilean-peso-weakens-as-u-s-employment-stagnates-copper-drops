Chile’s peso fell for the first time
in two weeks as U.S. employment stagnation fanned concern the
global economy is slowing and pushed down the price of copper,
the nation’s main export.  The peso weakened 0.1 percent to 460.06 per dollar at 12:59
p.m.  New York  time, from 459.45 yesterday. The currency
appreciated 1.3 percent this week.  U.S. payrolls were unchanged last month, the weakest
reading since September 2010, after an 85,000 gain in July that
was less than initially estimated, Labor Department data showed
today in  Washington .  “The new jobs data that came out was bad,” Hernan
Jimenez, an analyst at  ForexChile , said by phone from Santiago.
“That’s affecting internal demand and could eventually lead to
lower demand for copper.”  Copper fell as much as 1.7 percent in New York.  The central bank paid an average 460.55 pesos per dollar
for $50 million as part of a $12 billion effort to stem the
peso’s appreciation, according to data posted on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
