China’s stocks fell, capping the
benchmark index’s biggest weekly loss in three months, on
speculation the government won’t ease policy measures to cool
inflation even as economic and earnings growth slows.  Huaxia Bank Co. and Industrial Bank Co. led declines for
lenders after Caijing reported the odds the central bank will
lower the reserve requirement ratio for small and medium-sized
banks are small. Jiangxi Copper Co. slid 1.8 percent before a
report that may show the U.S. added fewer jobs in August.  Air
China Ltd. (601111)  dropped to the lowest since December 2009 after the
International Air Transport Association said global airlines
face a “weaker end to the year.”  “The economic growth momentum is weak globally and
investors are hesitant to increase their risk appetites,” said
Wei Wei, an analyst at West China Securities Co. in  Shanghai .
“For China, the problem is still inflation and there won’t be
any easing before prices taper off.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, slid 27.76 points, or 1.1 percent, to
2,528.28 at the 3 p.m. close. It lost 3.2 percent this week, the
most since the period ended May 27, after the central bank
ordered lenders to set aside more reserves against margin
deposits. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  fell 1.1 percent to 2,803.85 today.  The Shanghai gauge has slumped 10 percent this year as the
central bank raised  interest rates  five times and ordered
lenders to set aside more cash as deposit reserves 12 times
since the start of 2010 to contain inflation. It is valued at
11.6 times estimated earnings, matching a record low set on Aug.
22, according to daily data compiled by Bloomberg.  Financials Drop  Huaxia Bank, partly owned by Deutsche Bank AG, slid 2.1
percent to 10.36 yuan. Industrial Bank, part-owned by a unit of
HSBC Holdings Plc, fell 1.6 percent to 13.18 yuan.  Shanghai
Pudong Development Bank (600000)  Co., the Chinese partner of Citigroup
Inc., lost 0.9 percent to 9.29 yuan.  The chance is “quite small” for China’s central bank to
lower the reserve requirement ratio for small and medium-sized
banks, Caijing reported, citing Industrial Bank’s economist  Lu Zhengwei .  China’s financial and industrial stock gauges in the CSI
300 slumped more than 3 percent this week after the central bank
issued an order on Aug. 26 to lenders they will have to include
margin deposits in calculations of their  reserve requirements 
starting Sept. 5. The move is intended to deal with the rapid
growth in banks’ off-balance sheet lending that’s complicating
the central bank’s attempts to control liquidity, according to
 Wang Tao , a Hong Kong-based economist for UBS AG.  Industrials Slide  The industrials gauge slid 4.2 percent this week, the most
among the 10 industry groups, while the financials measure
including banks and developers dropped 3.3 percent. Huaxia Bank
and Bank of Ningbo Co. declined more than 7 percent.  Taiyuan
Heavy Industry Co. (600169)  retreated 6.7 percent. The central bank
action boosted speculation that banks will be more reluctant to
lend to small- and medium-sized manufacturers at a time when
export orders are slumping.  A gauge of export orders in the China Federation of
Logistics and Purchasing’s manufacturing index contracted for
the first time in more than two years, dropping to the lowest
since March 2009. The report was released yesterday. China’s
gross domestic product may expand 8.6 percent this year, less
than an earlier forecast of 8.7 percent, Credit Suisse Group AG
said yesterday, cutting its stock-index targets for 2011.  Developers fell after the Oriental Morning Post reported
Shanghai’s home transaction volumes fell to a six-year low. Poly
Real Estate Group Co., the second-largest developer by market
value, fell 3.4 percent to 10.66 yuan.  China  Vanke Co., the
biggest, slipped 0.5 percent to 8.10 yuan.  Stocks Outlook  China’s stocks will decline further this year as the
central bank is unlikely to ease its policy tightening measures
because of inflation, according to Dorris Chen, head of China
research at BNP Paribas SA. The Shanghai Composite will fall to
the 2,000 level in a worst-case scenario, Chen said in a
Bloomberg Television interview in Shanghai. Consumer prices rose
6.5 percent in July, the fastest pace in three years. The August
inflation figure is due Sept. 9.  China’s top priority is stabilizing prices and the
government doesn’t plan to alter the direction of economic
policies, Premier  Wen Jiabao  wrote in an article in the ruling
Communist Party’s Qiushi magazine this week.  Jiangxi Copper, China’s biggest producer of the metal, lost
1.8 percent to 32.41 yuan. Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group Co.,
the second largest, fell 2.3 percent to 23.06 yuan. Western
Mining Co., China’s fourth-largest maker of zinc concentrate,
dropped 1.9 percent to 13.24 yuan.  Airlines Drop  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 1.2 percent
yesterday, snapping a four-day advance, before a Labor
Department report that may show non-farm payrolls climbed by
68,000 in August after a 117,000 increase in July, according to
the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Air China, the nation’s largest international carrier, slid
3.3 percent to 8.72 yuan. China Southern Airlines Co., the
biggest carrier by fleet size, dropped 3.7 percent to 7.37 yuan.  A 0.4 percent decline in freight traffic in July from a
year earlier indicates the likely trend, the  International Air
Transport Association  said in a statement yesterday.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
