Russian billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov , owner of the New Jersey Nets basketball team, may run
for president in his country next March, RIA Novosti cited him
as saying.  Prokhorov, who has taken over as head of the Pravoye Delo
pro-business party in the run-up to Russia’s December
parliamentary elections, said he might stand for president if
his party wins the second-most votes in the legislative vote,
RIA reported.  “If the party gets second place in the elections, we will
put forward a candidate for the presidency and I don’t rule out
my candidacy,” Prokhorov said according to the news service.  Prokhorov said on Aug. 3 that he has no plans to run for
president next year and is focused on winning parliamentary
seats for his party.  Russia ’s third richest man, with a fortune
of $18 billion according to Forbes, Prokhorov has set a goal of
Pravoye Delo winning 15 percent of the vote nationwide, more
than double the 7 percent required to enter parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
