Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH and
partner Eli Lilly & Co. have decided not to make the new
diabetes treatment Trajenta available to patients in  Germany 
because of a pricing policy the companies said doesn’t reflect
“the positive benefits” of the medicine. They commented in an
e-mailed statement today.  The drugmakers are going ahead with plans to introduce
Trajenta in other European countries after gaining approval “a
few days ago,” they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
