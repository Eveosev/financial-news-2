Russia  is close to granting
extraction tax breaks for heavy  oil deposits  as compensation for
refiners that face a higher burden from an increase in export
duties, Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko said.  Russia won’t grant incentives specifically to companies,
Shmatko told reporters today in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe.  Russia plans to unify export duties on light fuels such as
diesel and raise them on heavy products such as fuel oil, taxing
them both at 65 percent of the crude oil levy starting from Oct.
1. That measure had been held up this year because of complaints
from companies including OAO Bashneft, the producer controlled
by billionaire Vladimir Yevtushenkov’s AFK Sistema, and OAO
 Tatneft (TATN)  that it was punitive.  “We’ll define characteristics for the extracted oil, such
as high viscosity,” Shmatko said. “Tatneft and Bashneft can
benefit within the framework of such incentives.”  The ministry plans to work out the measure in the near
future, Shmatko said. “In general, we’ve agreed on the issue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
