German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  called for changes in European Union treaties to shift
more economic and financial policy powers to Brussels, Bild
Zeitung reported, citing German lawmakers it didn’t name.  A treaty change is needed in response to  Europe ’s debt
crisis, even though this will pose difficult, the newspaper
quoted Schaeuble as saying at a closed meeting of Christian
Democratic lawmakers yesterday. Bild’s report didn’t cite any
more details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
