Soc. Quimica & Minera de Chile SA,
the country’s largest fertilizer producer, fell the most in two
weeks after Deutsche Bank AG removed a recommendation to buy the
stock after valuations became “expensive.”  Soquimich, as the company is known, dropped 1.4 percent to
29,130 pesos at 11:30 a.m. New York time and earlier retreated
as much as 3 percent, the steepest intraday fall since Aug. 19.  The stock trades at a 106 percent premium to its peers on a
price-to-earnings ratio, more than double its historical
premium, analyst Alessandro Baldoni wrote today in a client
note, lowering the firm’s rating to “hold.”  “We do not think further premium is deserved,” he wrote.  The company reported second-quarter profit on Aug. 30 of
$132 million, a 26 percent increase from $105 million a year
earlier, as higher prices pushed up sales.  Soquimich expects potash prices to rise in the second half
of the year, expanding its profit margins for the fertilizer
ingredient, Chief Executive Officer Patricio Contesse said
yesterday in a conference call.  The company probably will produce 1.7 million metric tons
of potash this year and 1.8 million tons next year, Contesse
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
