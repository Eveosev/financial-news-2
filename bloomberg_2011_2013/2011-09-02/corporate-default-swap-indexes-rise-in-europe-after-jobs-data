The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate debt rose after a report showed employment
in the U.S. unexpectedly stagnated in August, adding to signs
the global economic recovery is weakening.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings were 37.5 basis
points higher today at 691.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Payrolls were unchanged last month, the weakest reading
since September 2010, after an 85,000 gain in July that was less
than initially estimated, Labor Department data showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
called for a rise of 65,000.  “Payrolls are always a roll of the dice,” Roger Francis,
an analyst at Mizuho International Plc in London, said before
the report. “The economy is still growing, but not at a pace
that delivers upside for jobs.”  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was eight basis points higher at 164.5
basis points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior
debt of 25 banks and insurers increased 11 basis points to 246
and the subordinated index climbed 16 to 436.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
