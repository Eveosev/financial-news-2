At least 42 people died in  Nigeria ’s
central city of Jos in four days of clashes between Christian
and Muslim ethnic groups, religious leaders said.  Twenty Christians were killed by gunshots and machetes,
according to Abraham Hassan, a spokesman of the Christian
Association of Nigeria, while the corpses of 22 Muslims are in
the city’s central mosque, Sabo Shuaib, spokesman for the
Jama’tul Nasril Islam group, said today by phone.  “The whole metropolis is infested with weapons, Muslims
and Christians are shooting at each other,” Brigadier General
Hassan Umar, commander of the military  task force  in  Jos , said
today by phone. “They’re even shooting at our soldiers.” The
clash was triggered by a sniper attack on a pedestrian, Bashir
Abdullahi, an eyewitness, said in an interview late yesterday.  A group known as Boko Haram, or “Western education is a
sin,” has carried out a series of attacks, including multiple
bomb blasts on Christmas Eve in Jos that killed 80 people, in
its bid to establish Islamic rule in northern Nigeria.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer and most populous nation
of about 150 million people, is roughly split between a mainly
Muslim north and a predominantly Christian south. More than
14,000 people died in ethnic and religious clashes in the West
African nation between 1999 and 2009, according to the Brussels-
based  International Crisis Group .  To contact the reporter on this story:
