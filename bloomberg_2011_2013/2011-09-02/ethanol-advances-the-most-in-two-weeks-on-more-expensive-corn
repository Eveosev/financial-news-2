Ethanol futures rose the most in two
weeks in  Chicago  on concern that hot weather in the U.S. Midwest
hurt corn crops and may lead to higher costs for producing the
biofuel.  Futures snapped a four-day streak of losses a day after
INTL FCStone Inc. said the production of corn, the basis of
U.S.-made ethanol, will fall to a three-year low of 12.35
billion bushels.  “They came out with a bullish corn number,” said Matt Janney, a trader at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in Chicago.
“Ethanol had a lot of follow-through with corn. These guys are
still profitable. Price of corn is going higher, price of
ethanol is going higher.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery climbed 4.9 cents,
or 1.7 percent, to $2.892 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest one-day gain since Aug. 19. Futures are up 22
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf was
unchanged at $2.975 a gallon and in Chicago the fuel fell 2
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.8675, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  jumped 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $2.995
a gallon and on the West Coast, the biofuel added 0.5 cent to
$3.02.  Corn for December delivery increased 21.5 cents, or 2.9
percent, to $7.60 a bushel in Chicago.  The profit from turning a bushel of corn into 2.75 gallons
of ethanol, or the so-called crush margin, was 16 cents today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
