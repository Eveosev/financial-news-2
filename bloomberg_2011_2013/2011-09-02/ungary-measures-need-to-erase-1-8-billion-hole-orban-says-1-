Hungary’s new budget measures, to be
completed next week, will have to address a 350 billion forint
($1.8 billion) hole resulting from slower-than-forecast growth
and value-added tax refunds, Premier  Viktor Orban  said.  The steps will be discussed at a ruling party meeting next
week and the Cabinet will find a solution to keep the shortfall
from exceeding 3 percent of output this year, Orban said at a
press briefing with President Pal Schmitt in Budapest today.  Hungary must close a budget gap of “at least” 100 billion
forint after the government revised its 2011 economic growth to
about 2 percent from 3.1 percent, Orban said Aug. 17. An
additional 250 billion forint of value-added taxes must be
returned by the state to companies after a European Union
ruling, he said today.  “When I say that the 3 percent budget-deficit goal must be
met, I’m not only talking about the 100 billion-forint problem
resulting from the lower level of growth, but also the 250
billion-forint VAT problem,” Orban said.  The measures will include tax increases on alcohol, tobacco
and gambling as well as the delay of some spending items, Orban
said in a TV2 interview yesterday.  Hungary originally targeted a budget shortfall of 2.94
percent of gross domestic product this year, before the
effective nationalization of private pension funds which the
Cabinet had forecast would swing the budget into a surplus. Last
year the government posted a deficit of 4.3 percent, missing its
3.8 percent target. The goal for 2012 is a shortfall of 2.5
percent.  The government used the $16 billion of private pension
assets to lower the state’s debt level this year to 77 percent
of GDP from 81 percent, the highest among the EU’s eastern
members. A new debt reduction will be announced within “days,”
Orban said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
