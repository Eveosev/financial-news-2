Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,  Citigroup
Inc. (C) ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  were sued by the
 Federal Housing Finance Agency  over residential mortgage-backed
securities.  In lawsuits filed today in Manhattan federal court, the
agency, representing Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac , also named as
defendants Nomura Holdings Ltd.,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  Credit
Suisse Group AG. (CSGN)   The FHFA has been demanding refunds from banks for loans
sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that were based on false or
missing information about borrowers and properties. The two
government-backed mortgage finance firms had to be rescued by
taxpayers as defaults on home loans soared toward record levels.  The agency said in today’s filings that  Fannie Mae  and
Freddie Mac bought $6 billion in securities from Bank of
America; $24.8 billion from Merrill Lynch & Co., which Bank 
of America bought; and $3.5 billion from Citigroup.  The FHFA sued UBS AG,  Switzerland ’s biggest bank, in July
over $4.5 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities sold
to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, claiming it misstated the risks
of the investments. The suit seeks unspecified damages.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have operated under U.S.
conservatorship since 2008, when they were seized amid subprime
mortgage losses that pushed them toward insolvency.  Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Citigroup, declined to comment on today’s filing. Kerrie Cohen,
a spokeswoman for Barclays, and Kristin Lemkau, a
spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
