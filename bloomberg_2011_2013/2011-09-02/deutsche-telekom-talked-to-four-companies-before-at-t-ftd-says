Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  spoke with four
other companies before deciding to sell its U.S. business to
AT&T Inc.,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported today, citing a
high-ranking manager it didnâ€™t identify.  Sprint Nextel, Clearwire, private equity or a cable network
provider might be alternatives, the newspaper said.  If Deutsche Telekom were to negotiate with those companies,
it would likely get bids lower than the 27.5 billion euros ($39
billion) from AT&T, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
