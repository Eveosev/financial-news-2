Georgia Commerce Bank, the Atlanta-
based firm that caters to small businesses, purchased two failed
lenders as the tally of U.S. closures this year rose to 70.  Georgia banking officials closed Woodstock-based CreekSide
Bank and Patriot Bank of Georgia in Cumming, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. said today on its  website . The two failures, the
18th and 19th in the state this year, drained the deposit-
insurance fund of $71.7 million.  Banks are closing under stress from commercial real estate
loans, tied to property values that fell about 49 percent from
the October 2007 peak through April, according to Moodyâ€™s
Investors Service. Regulators have shuttered more than 390
lenders since the start of 2008, FDIC data show.  Georgia Commerce  picked up almost $208 million in deposits,
more than $250 million in assets and three branches, the FDIC
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
