The board of the Ghana Stock
Exchange has begun steps to demutualize the exchange, and make
it an entity limited by shares by 2013, Business and Financial
Times reported.  The commercialization of the bourse is expected to maximize
revenue for shareholders and make way for the introduction of
new products, the Accra-based newspaper said, citing Frank Adu,
chairman of the exchangeâ€™s council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
