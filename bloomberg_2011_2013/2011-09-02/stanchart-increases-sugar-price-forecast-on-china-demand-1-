Standard Chartered Bank raised its
average sugar price forecast for this year and 2012, citing
strong demand from  China  and tight global inventories.  Sugar futures traded on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  may
average 27 U.S. cents a pound in 2011 and 29 cents a pound in
2012, up 1 cent per pound from previous forecasts, Standard
Chartered analyst Abah Ofon said in a report.  “China’s widening import needs are providing robust
support to a global market already boosted by dismal 2011-2012
sugar-cane output estimates from  Brazil ,” Ofon said.  Dry weather in China “has affected the sugar-rich Guangxi
region” and may reduce the country’s sugar output to 11.5
million to 12 million tons in 2011-2012, short of its estimated
14 million tons of demand, Ofon said. Guangxi produces about 60
percent of China’s sugar output.  The spread between China’s sugar futures traded on the
Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange and the ICE sugar futures has
widened to a record due to tightness in China’s sugar supply,
Ofon said.  The Chinese government’s accelerated sugar sales from state
reserves, which totaled at least 1.68 million tons in the 2010-
2011 season, are unable to plug the shortfall as sugar
consumption in the nation’s food processing industry “has been
robust,” Ofon said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
