A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk rose after a report showed American employers added no jobs
in August, deepening concern that dwindling global economic
growth could dent corporate balance sheets.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, climbed 5 basis points to a mid-
price of 122.4 basis points as of 4:05 p.m. in  New York ,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  The credit swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, jumped after
Labor Department data showed payrolls were unchanged last month,
the weakest reading since September 2010, signaling U.S.
employers aren’t growing their businesses. The median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey called for a rise of 68,000.  “There is no amount of lipstick that can be put on these
numbers to make them look good,”  Adrian Miller , fixed-income
strategist at Miller Tabak Roberts Securities LLC in New York
said in an e-mail. “The depressed job market and widening
output gap will continue to put pressure on economic growth.”  In  Europe , the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings were 42.7 basis
points higher today at 694.3, according to Markit.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
