Sugar fell to a two-week low on
signs that world supplies will top demand as production climbs
to a record. Coffee also declined, while cocoa gained.  Global sugar output will exceed demand by 4.2 million
metric tons in the season starting in October, the  International
Sugar Organization  said yesterday. World supply will climb to an
all-time high of 172.4 million tons even as output drops in
Brazil, the top global producer, the group said.  “Sugar has massive surpluses coming,”  Shawn Hackett , the
president of Hackett Financial Advisors Inc., said in a
telephone interview from  Boynton Beach , Florida. “It has a
tough fundamental road to get over between now and the end of
the year.”  Raw sugar for October delivery dropped 0.41 cent, or 1.4
percent, to settle at 29.18 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier, the commodity touched 28.85
cents, the lowest since Aug. 19. The sweetener dropped 3.4
percent this week, the biggest decline since Aug. 5.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery fell 1.7
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.8805 a pound on ICE. Before today,
the commodity had risen for eight straight sessions, the longest
rally since November 2004.  Cocoa futures for December delivery rose $23, or 0.7
percent, to $3,098 a ton in  New York .  In  London , refined sugar and robusta coffee slumped, while
cocoa rose.  To contact the reporters on this story:
