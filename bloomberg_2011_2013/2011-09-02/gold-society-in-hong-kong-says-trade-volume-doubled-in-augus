The Chinese Gold & Silver Exchange
Society in  Hong Kong  said the average daily trade volume of gold
doubled to 10 million ounces last month, when prices reached a
record, from earlier this year.  Trading volume on the 100-year-old bourse may expand
another 20 percent should gold prices reach a record later this
year, President Haywood Cheung said in a phone interview from
Hong Kong yesterday.  Gold, which posted a record of $1,913.50 an ounce on Aug.
23, is in the 11th year of a bull market as investors seek to
diversify away from equities and some currencies. The metal is
up 29 percent this year, outperforming global stocks,
commodities, Treasuries and the  U.S. dollar , to which the  Hong
Kong dollar  is pegged.  “There’s been a lot of uncertainties related to foreign
exchange,” Cheung said. “Gold offers a good investment
alternative here, apart from property, as the currency
weakened.”  The society’s yuan-denominated gold contract, which has
been introduced on a trial basis, will officially start in
October, he said. After that, the bourse will look into listing
a yuan-denominated silver contract, he said.  Immediate-delivery gold traded little changed at $1,829.82
an ounce at 12:18 p.m. Hong Kong time, after climbing 12 percent
in August for its best monthly performance since November 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
