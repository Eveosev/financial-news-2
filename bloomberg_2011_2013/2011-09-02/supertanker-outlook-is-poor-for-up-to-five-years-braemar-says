Lower prices for supertankers, which
haul about a fifth of the world’s oil, signal a “poor”
earnings outlook for the fleet for as long as five years,
shipbroker Braemar Shipping Services Plc said.  Earnings from hiring out the vessels fail to cover owners’
operating expenses because too many new ships entered service,
creating an oversupply that depressed rents, London-based
Braemar said in a weekly report late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
