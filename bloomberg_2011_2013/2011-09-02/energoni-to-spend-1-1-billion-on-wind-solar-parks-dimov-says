Energoni AD, the Bulgarian Stock
Exchange’s biggest company by market capitalization, plans to
build wind and solar parks worth 1.5 billion lev ($1.1 billion)
in the next 15 years, Chairman Maxim Dimov said.  The Sofia-based renewable energy project developer plans to
raise 1 billion lev in a secondary share offering aimed “mostly
at international investors,” Dimov, 50, said in a Sofia
interview yesterday. Its shares began trading again on Aug. 12,
following a 15-month suspension, as a dispute over a 2010
capital increase was resolved in July.  Energoni, controlled by Greek investors and Bulgarian
brokerage Mac Cup EAD, has a 10-to-15-year portfolio of wind
projects totaling 2,271 megawatts and solar projects amounting
to 400 megawatts. It got three renewable energy generation
licenses from Bulgarian authorities to build two wind parks with
200-megawatt capacity each and a 120-megawatt solar park.  “ Bulgaria  is a good place for renewable energy production
in terms of sun and wind potential and existing legislation,”
Dimov said. “We expect to sell the additional share issue in a
package to foreign investors in a short term. Preparations for
the share issue will start this year.”  Bulgaria aims to meet its  European Union  target of raising
the share of renewable energy in final consumption to 16 percent
in 2020 from 11 percent in 2010. The target share of electricity
produced by wind and solar parks, hydro- and geothermal  power
plants  is 21 percent by 2020 from 15 percent in 2010, according
to the Energy and Economy Ministry.  Wind Investment  About 450 million euros ($641 million) have been invested
in Bulgarian wind parks by international investors including
 Enel Green Power SpA (EGPW) , a unit of  Italy ’s biggest utility, AES Geo
Energy, a unit of U.S. power utility  AES Corp. (AES) , and a unit of
German wind turbine maker Enercon GmbH, according to the
Bulgarian Wind Energy Association.  Energoni shares traded unchanged at 3.1 lev per share in
Sofia today, bringing its market capitalization to almost 1.7
billion lev. UniCredit Bank Austria AG, a unit of  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,
holds 2 percent of Energoni shares and Swiss-based investment
bank Pictet & Cie holds 1.6 percent. Energoni contracted Evi
Distribution SA in  Switzerland  to work on the projects.  The company will start construction of a 550-million lev
wind park near the village of Dobrin in northern Bulgaria and
the first section of the plant with capacity of 54 megawatts
will be ready in 2012, Dimov said. The full 200-megawatt
capacity will be reached in 2015, he said.  Construction of a 26-megawatt solar park near the city of
Pernik in western Bulgaria will start this year and its full
120-megawatt capacity will be achieved in 2013, Dimov said. The
project is worth 130 million lev, he said.  Construction Permits  Energoni has a permit for a second 200-megawatt wind park
near the capital Sofia, worth also 550 million lev, Dimov said.
He gave no timeframe for its construction.  Bulgaria increased output from renewable energy sources by
67 percent last year to 5,509 gigawatt-hours as new hydropower
plants, wind and solar parks went into operation, according to
the Energy and Economy Ministry. Total wind capacity rose 38
percent to 465 megawatts, while solar projects’ total capacity
was 21.4 megawatts, the ministry said.  Other international companies operating wind and solar
parks in Bulgaria include Mitsubishi Corp. and  South Korea ’s SDN
Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
