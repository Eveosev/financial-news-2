The  Indianapolis Colts  hired former
 Ohio State University  coach  Jim Tressel  as a game-day adviser,
three months after he resigned from the Buckeyes amid an
investigation into rules violations.  Colts coach Jim Caldwell said today that Tressel, 58, will
assist the National Football League team with various tasks,
according to spokesman Avis Roper.  Tressel quit his job at Ohio State after a National
Collegiate Athletic Association investigation revealed that the
coach knew about his playersâ€™ infractions and failed to notify
the NCAA.  In December, quarterback Terrelle Pryor and five Buckeyes
were suspended for selling or trading uniforms and other
memorabilia to the owner of a tattoo parlor. The school vacated
all 12 of its wins in the 2010 season, including a Sugar Bowl
victory, following the NCAA investigation.  Tressel was 94-22 in 10 years at Ohio State. He led the
Buckeyes to their first national championship in 34 years during
the 2002 season and won at least a share of the Big Ten
conference title in each of the last six seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
