U.K. government bonds rose as stock
markets declined and a report showed British construction growth
slowed more than economists predicted last month, supporting
demand for the perceived safety of fixed income.  The advance pushed the 10-year yield down for a second day,
trimming a weekly gain. A gauge of building activity fell to
52.6 from 53.5 in July, Markit Economics Ltd. and the  Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply  said, below the 53.2 median
forecast of nine economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Construction
orders fell 16.3 percent in the second quarter from the previous
three months, the  Office for National Statistics  said today. The
FTSE 100 Index fell 1.1 percent, ending three days of gains.  “The background hasn’t really improved, and we are still
seeing pretty worrying data and worrying signs that some
difficult times remain ahead,” said  John Wraith , a fixed-income
strategist at Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit in
London. “It was always a matter of time until people started to
look for safe havens again.”  The 10-year gilt yield fell three basis points to 2.51
percent as of 10:06 a.m. in  London , after rising to 2.64 percent
yesterday, the highest since Aug. 10. The 3.75 percent security
due September 2020 climbed 0.260 or 2.60 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,619) face amount, to 109.95. Two-year yields were little
changed at 0.57 percent.  Gilts have handed investors a 7.9 percent return in 2011,
compared with 5.7 percent from German debt and 7.7 percent from
U.S. Treasuries, according to the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies.  The pound was little changed at $1.6193 and gained 0.3
percent to 87.90 pence per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
