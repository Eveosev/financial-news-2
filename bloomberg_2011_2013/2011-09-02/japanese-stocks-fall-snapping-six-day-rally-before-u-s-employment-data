Japanese stocks fell, snapping a
six-day rally, ahead of a report forecast to show the U.S. added
fewer jobs in August as the recovery in the world’s largest
economy slows.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics,
slid 4.3 percent.  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , the nation’s
third-largest lender by market value, dropped 2.6 percent after
bank shares dropped in the U.S.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , the country’s
biggest trading company, slid 1.1 percent after commodity prices
declined.  KDDI Corp. (9433) , Japan’s No. 2 mobile-phone operator by
revenue, gained 0.7 percent after its stock rating was raised to
“buy” from “hold” by Deutsche Bank Ag.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 1.2 percent to 8,950.74
as of the 3 p.m. trading close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index
declined 1.1 percent to 769.78. For the week, the Nikkei has
risen 1.7 percent, advancing for a second week, while the Topix
is also up 1.8 percent.  “As people cut their forecasts for the jobs data, it’s
difficult for investors to take a position one way or the
other,” said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Tokyo-based
Nomura Holdings Inc.  Incoming Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda today
picked  Democratic Party  of Japan lawmaker Jun Azumi as finance
minister. Noda, who previously served as finance minister, takes
the reins of a country beset by economic contraction, burdened
by the world’s largest debt and reeling from the March
earthquake and nuclear disaster.  ‘Political Instability’  “It’s pleasing that Noda comes from a finance background
and is showing preparedness to tackle Japan’s burgeoning debt
levels,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion in
equities at Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “But political
instability has been a feature of Japan for some time, and so
it’s prudent to adopt a ‘wait-and-see’ approach to this
change.”  The Topix has fallen 14 percent this year amid concern U.S.
growth is sputtering and Europe’s debt crisis will damage the
banking system, damping demand in two of  Japan ’s biggest export
markets. The decline has cut the price of shares on the index to
0.9 times book value, near the lowest since March 2009.  Stocks also dropped after a report today showed Japanese
companies unexpectedly cut  capital spending  by 8.2 percent in
the second quarter, fanning concern the nation’s recovery from
the March 11 earthquake and tsunami is stalling.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent
today. In  New York , the index dropped 1.2 percent yesterday,
snapping a four-day advance, before a Labor Department report
today that may show non-farm payrolls climbed by 68,000 in
August after a 117,000 increase in July, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Jan Hatzius cut his forecast for
the employment gain to 25,000 from 50,000.  Brian Jones , an
economist at  Societe Generale , lowered his prediction to an
increase of 9,000 from 67,000.  “The U.S. jobs data won’t point to an economic recovery
even if it matches the highest estimate,” said  Kenichi Hirano ,
general manager and strategist at Tachibana Securities Co. in
Tokyo. “Lower-than-expected numbers are unlikely to trigger
further monetary easing immediately due to concerns about side
effects. Whether the numbers go up or down, U.S. stocks are
likely to drop.”  Sony, Toyota  Electric appliance makers, carmakers and banks contributed
the most to the Topix’s drop. Sony slumped 4.3 percent to 1,625
yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker, dropped
1.6 percent to 2,711 yen. Mizuho Financial Group dropped 2.6
percent to 113 yen.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s
largest lender, declined 1.4 percent to 342 yen.  Mitsubishi Corp. slid 1.1 percent to 1,829 yen after the
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials fell 0.6
percent yesterday. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for
six industrial metals including copper and aluminum dropped 1.3
percent.  KDDI advanced 0.7 percent to 577,000 yen after Deutsche Bank
set the 12-month target price for the stock at 650,000 yen. Also,
Tokyo Electric Power Co. is considering selling 200 billion yen
at market value of KDDI shares to the company, Jiji Press
reported on its website.  Tokyo  Electric, the utility at the
center of the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl, fell 0.3
percent to 386 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
