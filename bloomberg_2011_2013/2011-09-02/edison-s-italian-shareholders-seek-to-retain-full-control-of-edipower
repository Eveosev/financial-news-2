Edison SpA (EDN) ’s Italian shareholders
would like to keep 100 percent of its Edipower unit in exchange
for giving Electricite de France SA control over  Italy ’s second
biggest power company, Iren General Manager Andrea Viero said.  The Italians would like to keep all of Edipower and set
aside the possibility of a  put option  on Edison which had
previously been discussed in negotiations with EDF, Viero said
today on the sidelines of a conference in Cernobbio, Italy.  “I don’t think anyone on the Italian side is interested in
the put at this point,” he said. “I doubt, however, that the
French will be interested” in giving all of Edipower up.  A preliminary agreement reached in March between EDF and
Italian shareholders was held up by disagreements among
shareholders on how to split company assets and opposition to a
French takeover from the Italian government. EDF Chief Executive
Officer  Henri Proglio  said July 29 he won’t renegotiate a deal
on Edison until Italian authorities give their approval.  EDF managers and Italian Industry Minister Paolo Romani
will meet on Sept. 5 to discuss a possible deal, Viero said,
adding that “a political solution” was the only way out of the
current impasse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
