Stock mutual funds are having their
worst year since 1998 relative to their benchmarks, as higher
volatility makes it harder to pick stocks, according to  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)   Among 2,806 funds tracked by the brokerage, 47 percent
underperformed their benchmarks by more than 2.5 percentage
points this year, the most since the 55 percent recorded in
1998. Only 13 percent of the funds beat the market by the same
margin. The underperformance accelerated last month, with the
proportion of trailing funds almost doubling from July,
according to JPMorgan data.  U.S. stock price swings widened at the fastest rate since
the 1987 crash in the month through Aug. 23 as investors weighed
stalling economic growth against the prospect of additional
stimulus from the  Federal Reserve . The volatility helped drive
August options volume to a record 550.1 million contracts on
demand for a hedge against equity losses, according to the
Chicago-based Options Industry Council.  “The turbulence of markets in August caused a rapid
deterioration of active manager performance,” Thomas J. Lee,
JPMorgan’s chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in the report
dated yesterday.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index plunged 6.7 percent on Aug.
8, before surging 4.7 percent, dropping 4.4 percent and jumping
4.6 percent in the next three days. The benchmark gauge fell as
much as 2.3 percent today as a government report showing
employment stagnated stoked concern the economy may fall into a
recession.  High-Beta Preference  The trailing funds are likely to increase holdings in
companies that move the most relative to the benchmark, known as
high-beta stocks, to boost performance, Lee said. That
preference may result in a year-end rally, he said.  Since 1995, there had been nine years when more funds
trailed than those that beat from Jan. 1 through Aug. 31. The
market rallied in the last four months of a year in all but
2008, with the  S&P 500  rising 8.5 percent on average, JPMorgan
data showed.  “When active managers trail, there is a tendency for
markets to rise into” the end of the year, Lee wrote.
“Intuitively, when there are more trailing, there will be
logically an attempt to outperform, which should be driven by
risk-taking.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
