JA Mitsui Leasing Ltd. plans to
borrow 20 billion yen ($260 million) this month from a group of
banks led by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., according to three
people with direct knowledge of the matter.  The five-year loan will be priced at 15 basis points more
than the three-month Tokyo interbank offered rate for yen,
according to the people, who declined to be identified because
the information is private. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  Editors: Pavel Alpeyev  To contact the reporters on this story:
