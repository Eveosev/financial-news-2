Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d., the
largest supermarket chain in the Balkans, received a 137.6
million-euro ($196 million) syndicated loan to restructure its
debt.  The unsecured loan is divided into two tranches, one with a
maturity of four years with a bullet repayment and the other a
four-year amortized structure with half-yearly repayments of
principal, the Ljubljana-based retailer said in a  statement  to
the city stock exchange.  The loan was organized by  Austria ’s Erste Bank AG in Vienna
with Slovenia’s Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. acting as an agent.
Other commercial lenders include Abanka Vipa d.d., Banka Celje
d.d., Banka Koper d.d., BAWAG AG,  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , Dezelna Banka
Slovenije d.d., Raiffeisenlandesbank Oberoesterreich AG and VTB
Bank Austria AG.  There will be no increase in the financial indebtedness of
Mercator from this transaction, it said. It’s the second
syndicated loan Mercator took out in this year after a 130
million-euro facility in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
