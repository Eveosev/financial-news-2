Indian stocks rose to a two-week
high, resuming trading after a two-day holiday during which
economic data eased concerns the global recovery is faltering.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , the nationâ€™s biggest mobile operator,
rose after a Daily Monitor news report that its Ugandan unit
plans to stop connecting calls with rival Uganda Telecom Ltd.
over a dispute involving unpaid fees.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) ,
the operator of the largest oil refinery in the world, gained
after BP Plc. completed the purchase of a 30 percent stake in 21
energy assets operated by the Indian company.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose
151.18 or 0.9 percent to 16,827.93, the highest since Aug. 17,
according to preliminary closing prices in Mumbai. The measure
added 6.2 percent this week, ending a fifth-week losing streak
that was the longest since October 2008. Companies on the gauge
trade for 14.1 times estimated earnings, near the lowest level
since April 2009, and down from 21.5 time last March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
