Veronica Campbell-Brown won the
women’s 200-meter gold medal at the  IAAF world athletics
championships , while fellow Jamaican Usain Bolt qualified for
tomorrow’s men’s final.  Two-time Olympic champion Campbell-Brown won in 22.22
seconds in Daegu,  South Korea . Carmelita Jeter of the U.S., who
took the 100 meters ahead of Campbell-Brown earlier in the week,
was second and defending champion Allyson Felix of the U.S.
finished third.  Defending champion and world record holder Bolt won his
200-meter semifinal in 20.31 seconds, the second-fastest time
behind  France ’s Christophe Lemaitre, who ran 20.17 in his heat.  Bolt, a double Olympic sprint champion, was disqualified in
the 100-meters final for a false start six days ago. In today’s
heats, the Jamaican looked around after coming out of the bend
in the lead, slowing down in the final meters of the race.  The U.S. team of Greg Nixon, Bershawn Jackson, Angelo Taylor and LaShawn Merritt won a fourth straight world title in
the men’s 4x400-meter relay in 2:59.31, ahead of  South Africa 
and  Jamaica .  The U.S. was third going into the final turn before Merritt
overtook Jamaica’s Leford Green and South Africa’s L.J. van Zyl
in the final stages.  Oscar Pistorius, a double amputee sprinter, was left out of
the South African team after running the first leg in
yesterday’s qualifying heats. Pistorius, who was born without
fibulas and runs with J-shaped carbon-fiber blades, was replaced
by Shane Victor.  Also on the seventh day of the championships, David Storl
of  Germany  won the men’s shot put with a personal best of 21.78
meters (71 feet), while Dwight Phillips of the U.S. retained his
world title in the men’s long jump with a leap of 8.45 meters.  Vivian Cheruiyot successfully defended her 5,000-meter
title in a time of 14:55.36. The Kenyan is only the second woman
to win both the 5,000 and 10,000 meters in the same
championships. In the women’s javelin, Maria Abakumova won
 Russia ’s fifth gold medal with a championship record of 71.99
meters.  Caster Semenya, the defending 800 meter world champion,
qualified for the finals in 1:58.07, her best time of the
season. Semenya was banned from competing for 11 months because
of questions about her sex after she took the world title in
Berlin two years ago. The South African was cleared to compete
in July 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
