Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski apologized on behalf of people who spray-painted
swastikas and slogans on a monument to Jews murdered during
World War II.  “Even if this was just simple stupidity or an immature
outburst, we should pray that human sensitivity, our Christian
sensitivity, was also expressed in the fact that we are able to
say and repeat with deep respect -- we’re sorry,” Komorowski
said today in Cieszyn,  Poland .  The slogans in green paint included “They were flammable”
and “I’m not sorry about Jedwabne,” a reference to a massacre
in northeastern Poland. Poland’s German occupiers were blamed
for the deaths on July 10, 1941 ,until historians discovered
that about 40 Poles had herded their Jewish neighbors into a
nearby barn and set it alight, killing more than 300 people.  “I don’t think these people represent Polish society, but
the event itself is a challenge for Poland,” Michael Schudrich,
Poland’s chief rabbi, said in a telephone interview today. “The
basic problem to society is not that you have some people
willing to desecrate such a monument, but what the good people
do, how they react.”  A book by Polish-born Princeton professor Jan Tomasz Gross
on the Jedwabne murders, published in 2000, sparked a debate
about Polish participation in the Holocaust. An estimated 3
million Polish Jews were killed during World War II, mostly in
Nazi concentration camps.  “Non-Jewish Poles also suffered horribly under the
Nazis,” said Schudrich. “I’m certain that the vast majority of
Poles are appalled by what’s just happened.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
