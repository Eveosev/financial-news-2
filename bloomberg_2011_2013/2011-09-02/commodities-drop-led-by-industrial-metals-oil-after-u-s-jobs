Commodities slumped, led by declines
in industrial metals and energy after the U.S. jobs report
signaled slower demand for raw materials.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 commodities fell 1.6
percent by 2:12 p.m. in  London . Oil fell 3 percent and copper
declined 1.1 percent.  Payrolls were unchanged last month, the weakest reading
since September 2010, after an 85,000 gain in July that was less
than initially estimated, Labor Department data showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
called for a rise of 65,000.  “The data is negative enough to believe there will be a
very slow recovery, and demand for oil is already weak,” said
 Eugen Weinberg , Frankfurt-based head of commodities research at
Commerzbank AG.  Gold advanced 2.8 percent to $1,881 an ounce and silver
gained 3.2 percent to $42.8887 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
