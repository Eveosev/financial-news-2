Celtic has been reinstated to the
Europa League after the Scottish soccer club’s protest over an
opponent’s use of ineligible players was upheld.  European soccer body  UEFA  ruled Switzerland’s Sion used the
players in two Europa playoff games between the teams, with both
matches now forfeited to Celtic. Sion won the series 3-1 to
qualify for the group stage of Europe’s second-tier club
competition.  “We are pleased by this decision, the approach which has
been taken by UEFA and the fact that UEFA rules and regulations
have been upheld,” the Scottish club said in a  statement  on its
website.  Celtic will take Sion’s place against Atletico Madrid,
Udinese and Renne in the Europa League group stage. Sion has
three days to lodge an appeal once it receives the written
decision, UEFA  said  on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
