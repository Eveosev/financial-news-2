Austria’s Finance Minister Maria Fekter said that while she has the right to nationalize
 Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS)  at the end of the year should
the bank fail to pay the dividend on the 1 billion euros ($1.4
billion) of state aid, her “will” to take over the lender is
“very limited.”  The lender is “working hard to implement its strategy,”
Fekter told reporters in Alpbach, Austria today. “I believe it
is justified to give it the time to restructure.”  Volksbanken, which failed  Europe ’s stress test last month,
isn’t allowed to pay dividends on the state capital if it has a
loss by Austrian Accounting Principles, according to the terms
of the capital. The bank, which hasn’t paid dividends since it
received the bailout in 2009, said last week that it may fail to
pay this year’s coupon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
