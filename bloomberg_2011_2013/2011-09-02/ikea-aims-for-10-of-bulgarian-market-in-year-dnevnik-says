Ikea, the worldâ€™s biggest home-
furnishings retailer, wants to take a 10 percent share of the
Bulgarian market in its first year of operation,  Dnevnik 
reported, citing the company.  Fourlis Holdings SA (FOYRK) , which holds the IKEA franchise for the
region, will open the first store in  Bulgaria  on Sept. 20 close
to the capital Sofia, Dnevnik said. The Bulgarian furniture
market is estimated at between 450 million lev ($328 million)
and 550 million lev a year, according to Dnevnik.  Fourlis plans to open a second store in the Black Sea city
of Varna though the project is at an early stage of development,
Dnevnik said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
