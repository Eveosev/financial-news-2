MVM Zrt.,  Hungary ’s government-owned
power wholesaler, said it will take over and operate the state
telecommunications network as part of its plan to enter the
market.  MVM will also purchase a 49.5 percent stake in Bakonyi
Elektromos Muvek Termelo Zrt., giving MVM full ownership of the
power plant, the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  MVM plans to form a company that will build a link between
natural gas networks in Hungary and Slovakia, the company said.  -- Editors: Tim Farrand, Peter Woodifield  To contact the reporter on this story:
