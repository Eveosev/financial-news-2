Following is the text of the
worldwide semiconductor sales report.  The  Semiconductor Industry Association , representing U.S.
leadership in semiconductor manufacturing and design, today
announced that worldwide sales of semiconductors were $24.9
billion for the month of July 2011, essentially flat from prior
month, but 3.2 percent higher than the same period last year on
a year to date basis. All monthly sales numbers represent a
three-month moving average.  “Although the industry has experienced a slowing in the
rate of growth in recent months amidst global economic
uncertainty, we expect seasonal demand to drive sales growth in
the second half of the year through the holiday season,” said
Brian Toohey, president, Semiconductor Industry Association.  Global economic stagnation will continue to affect the pace
of growth across semiconductor markets. However, the industry is
encouraged by better-than-expected recovery efforts in  Japan .  SOURCE: Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA)  To contact the reporter on this story:
