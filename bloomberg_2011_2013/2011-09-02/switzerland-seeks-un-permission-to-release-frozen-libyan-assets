Switzerland  is seeking permission
from the United Nations Sanctions Committee to release $420
million in frozen Libyan assets to the Libyan people.  The money is controlled by public entities from the North
African country, Swiss Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey said
in a speech in Paris yesterday. Switzerland froze 650 million
Swiss francs ($833 million) of Libyan funds in May and June,
including assets belonging to Muammar Qaddafi and his family.  “Because of the violence committed against its own people,
the Qaddafi regime has lost all claims to the frozen assets and
any right to get the money back,” Calmy-Rey said. “We should
all be driven by a single objective, making sure we bring relief
to the Libyan people who have suffered for too long.”  Switzerland’s embassy in Tripoli will be reopened as soon
as possible, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
