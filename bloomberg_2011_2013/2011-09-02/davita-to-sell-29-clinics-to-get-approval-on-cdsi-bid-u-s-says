DaVita Inc. (DVA)  must sell 29 clinics
that provide dialysis services to get U.S. approval for the
company’s bid to buy CDSI I Holding Co., the Federal Trade
Commission said.  Competition will be preserved in 22 markets with the
divestment, which is part of a proposed settlement, the FTC said
in a statement.  DaVita is the Denver-based provider of outpatient dialysis
services, which are used to treat people with advanced  kidney
disease , according to the FTC. DaVita is seeking to buy for $689
million Nashville, Tennessee-based CDSI, the fifth-largest
provider of such services.  Skip Thurman, a spokesman for DaVita, didn’t immediately
return phone calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
