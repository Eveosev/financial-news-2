The U.K. pound extended gains versus
the dollar after data showed U.S. payrolls remained unchanged in
August, falling short of economist estimates.  Sterling surged 0.4 percent to $1.6246 after the data was
released, before settling 0.3 percent stronger at $1.6230.  Payrolls were unchanged last month, the weakest reading
since September 2010, after an 85,000 gain in July that was less
than initially estimated, Labor Department data showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
called for a rise of 65,000. The jobless rate held at 9.1
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
