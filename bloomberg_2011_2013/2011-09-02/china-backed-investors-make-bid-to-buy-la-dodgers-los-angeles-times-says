Investors partly financed by state-
owned institutions in  China  made a $1.2 billion bid for the Los
Angeles Dodgers baseball team, which filed for bankruptcy in
June, the Los Angeles Times reported yesterday.  The unsolicited cash offer, headed by Los Angeles Marathon
founder William Burke, was made in a letter to Dodgers owner
 Frank McCourt , the Times reported, citing two people whom it did
not name. The offer must be approved by Major League Baseball
and the  bankruptcy court , the newspaper said.  The money to pay for the deal would come from American
investors and “certain state-owned investment institutions of
the People’s Republic of China,” the letter said, according to
the Times.  The bid was made on Burke’s behalf by New York-based Signal
Capital Management, the newspaper said. Burke and a spokesman
for McCourt declined to comment, the Times said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
