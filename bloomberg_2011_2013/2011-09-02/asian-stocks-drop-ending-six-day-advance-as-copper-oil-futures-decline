Asian stocks fell, paring the
biggest weekly gain since March, and U.S. and U.K. index futures
dropped ahead of an American jobs report that may show
unemployment exceeds 9 percent. Copper fell for a second day and
oil declined.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 1.1 percent as of 11:56
a.m. in  Tokyo , the first decline in seven days. Futures on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.6 percent and contracts on
the FTSE 100 Index fell 1.4 percent. Copper in London declined
0.4 percent and oil retreated 0.4 percent to $88.57 a barrel.
Ten-year Treasury note yields were little changed at 2.13
percent.  “The U.S. recovery remains anemic, with lingering concerns
over job creation and house prices,” said  Tim Schroeders , who
helps manage $1 billion in equities at Pengana Capital Ltd. in
Melbourne. “Expectations are relatively low for tonight’s jobs
data.”  Asian stocks have climbed this week after concern the
global economy may slow sent the regional benchmark to its
biggest loss since May 2010 last month. Data today from the U.S.
Labor Department may show that employers added fewer workers in
August and estimates indicate that  Germany ’s government next
week will report factory orders fell for the first time in four
months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
