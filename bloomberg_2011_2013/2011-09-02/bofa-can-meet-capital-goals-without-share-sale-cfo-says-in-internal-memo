Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the biggest
U.S. lender by assets, affirmed the company can meet capital
goals without selling common stock and said it had expected some
of the recent surge in mortgage-related legal actions.  “There are many non-dilutive ways for us to get there,”
Chief Financial Officer  Bruce Thompson  said today, referring to
the firm’s regulatory capital standards. Thompson commented in
an internal memo to employees of the Charlotte, North Carolina-
based lender.  “We’ve made tremendous progress in resolving mortgage-
related legal claims,” Thompson said, adding that the bank is
being sued now because in many cases, the statutes of
limitations have been running out. “Now we have to simply let
the judicial process work.”  Bank of America was the biggest decliner in the KBW Bank
Index today, dropping 7.5 percent to $7.32 as of 2:01 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
