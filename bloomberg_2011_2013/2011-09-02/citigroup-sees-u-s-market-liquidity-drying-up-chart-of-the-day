Investors are demonstrating a
reluctance to trade in U.S. financial markets that’s “unlikely
to improve substantially” any time soon, according to  Mike Lee ,
a Citigroup Inc. analyst.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how Lee reached his conclusion:
by tracking the Citigroup U.S. Market Liquidity Index, derived
from five indicators in the swap and option markets. Within the
past two weeks, the index rose to its highest level since May
2009, when a global financial crisis sparked by falling U.S.
home prices was ending.  “Deteriorating economic conditions and volatile markets
have raised investor fears about a repeat,” Lee, based in New
York, wrote two days ago in a report. That concern has weighed
on liquidity, or the ease of buying and selling, he wrote.  Citigroup’s index, which rises when liquidity shows signs
of drying up and falls when it improves, reached last month’s
peak on Aug. 25. The increase resulted mainly from a surge in
the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as
the VIX, according to the report.  The VIX, calculated from prices for Standard & Poor’s 500
Index options, rose 25 percent in August to 31.62. The monthly
advance was the fourth in a row, marking the longest series of
gains since 2002.  Corporate bonds are represented in the Citigroup gauge by
the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, based on
rates for credit default swaps. Ten-year Treasury bond futures,
interest-rate swaps and rate-swap options are included in the
calculations as well.  To contact the reporter on this story:
