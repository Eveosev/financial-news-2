The cabinet announced by incoming
Japanese Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  today will have a
“neutral” impact on the nation’s bond yields, according to
Koichi Haji, chief economist at NLI Research Institute.  “The fiscal reconstruction policy will continue” under
the new cabinet, Haji said in an interview today. “That will be
neutral for long-term yields. I don’t think the formation of the
cabinet will significantly change the previous trading range.”  Ten-year yields will trade in a range of 0.90 percent to
1.20 percent in the near term, Haji said. Yields were at 1.07
percent today.  Noda named his cabinet today after winning the ruling
 Democratic Party  of Japan’s leadership race on Aug. 29 to
succeed  Naoto Kan . He picked Jun Azumi, formerly the DPJ’s Diet
affairs chief, to succeed him as finance minister.  The appointment of Azumi was a “surprise,” though his
policies will probably be similar to Noda’s, Haji said.  Azumi is also anticipated to play a key role in passing a
third supplementary budget for the current fiscal year and a
budget for next fiscal, because he has strong ties with the
opposition parties, Haji said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
