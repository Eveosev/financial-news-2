The Bovespa index fell the most in
two weeks after a report showed U.S. employment growth stalled
last month, adding to concern that the expansion in Brazil’s
second-biggest trading partner is faltering.  The gauge declined 2.7 percent to 56,531.62 at the close of
trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time. It gained 6 percent this
week, the biggest weekly advance since July 2010. Fifty-nine
stocks dropped on the index, while seven rose. The real weakened
1.2 percent to 1.6397 per  U.S. dollar .  The U.S. Labor Department reported that payrolls were
unchanged last month after an 85,000 gain in July that was less
than initially estimated. The  unemployment rate  held at 9.1
percent.  “It’s not surprising that the market is selling off here
after yesterday’s positive performance and also these U.S. jobs
numbers,” said Leandro Martins, head analyst at Walpires SA, a
Sao Paulo-based brokerage, in a telephone interview. “The
market remains nervous, and volatility continues to be high.”  Brazil’s benchmark equity index rose 2.9 percent yesterday,
after the central bank unexpectedly cut borrowing costs at a
time when inflation is running at a six-year high of 7.1
percent. The bank’s board cut the benchmark Selic rate a half
point to 12 percent after having raised the rate at each of its
past five meetings.  Petrobras, Brookfield  Petroleo Brasileiro SA,  Brazil ’s state-controlled oil
company, fell 3.2 percent to 20.37 reais as crude prices
dropped. Real estate companies plunged as traders reduced bets
for lower borrowing costs in Brazil. Homebuilder Brookfield
Incorporacoes SA slumped 6.8 percent to 6.90 reais.  The yield on the interest rate futures contract due in
January 2013, the most actively-traded in  Sao Paulo  today, rose
18 basis points, or 0.18 percentage point, to 10.69 percent.  Yields on interest-rate futures rose after the unexpected
rate cut this week spurred concern policy makers are abandoning
their fight against price increases too soon and Brazil’s latest
growth figure showed internal demand is still strong, said  Zeina Latif , an economist at RBS Securities Inc. in Sao Paulo.  Brazil’s gross domestic product in the second quarter rose
3.1 percent from a year earlier, the national statistics agency
reported today. The median estimate of 37 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a 3.2 percent increase.  MMX, JBS  MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA, the iron-ore miner controlled
by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , fell 5.1 percent to 8.03
reais after being cut to “neutral’ from ‘buy’ at Bank of
America.  JBS SA (JBSS3) , the world’s biggest beef producer, retreated
3.4 percent to 4.24 reais, as exporters fell on the U.S. jobs
report.  The Bovespa trades at 9.5 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, near the lowest since March 2009, according to weekly
data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares to a ratio of 11.7 for
the Shanghai Composite Index, 5.9 for  Russia ’s Micex and 14.1
for  India ’s Sensex.  Traders moved 7.1 billion reais ($4.3 billion) in stocks in
Sao Paulo today, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares
to a daily average this year of 6.54 billion reais through Aug.
30, according to data from the exchange.  Foreign investors have pulled 659.1 million reais from
 Latin America ’s largest equity market in the year through Aug.
29, according to the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
