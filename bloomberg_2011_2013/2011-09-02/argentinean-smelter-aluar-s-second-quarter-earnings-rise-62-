Aluar Aluminio Argentino SAIC (ALUA) ,
operator of  South America ’s biggest aluminum smelter, said
second-quarter earnings rose 62 percent from the previous
quarter to 761 million pesos ($180 million).  The gain was attributable to increasing commodity prices
and higher margins per ton, the company said in a filing to
securities regulators late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
