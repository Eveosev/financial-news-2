Peru ’s dollar bonds posted their
longest winning streak in 11 months after  Standard & Poor’s 
raised the country’s foreign debt rating for the first time
since 2008.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 4.95 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.64 cent to 123 cents per dollar.  Yields have fallen for eight straight days, the longest
streak since the period ending Sept. 30, 2010, when they also
dropped eight days.  S&P raised Peru to BBB, the second-lowest investment grade,
from BBB- on Aug. 30 and gave the rating a stable outlook.
President  Ollanta Humala , a former army rebel and one-time ally
of Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez , will likely foster growth,
cut public debt and lure investment in the Andean country’s
mineral and gas reserves, the ratings company said.  “A lot of market participants were concerned about the
Humala story, and the fact that S&P increased the rating gives
confidence on that front,” said Kathryn Rooney Vera, an
emerging markets analyst at Bulltick Capital Markets in Miami.
“Peru’s macro fundamentals are extremely strong, and the only
real risk has been on the political front.”  Since winning a June 5 presidential runoff, Humala has
backed away from election pledges to renegotiate the country’s
free trade accord with the U.S and rewrite the constitution to
boost state control of the economy.  The sol was little changed at 2.7280 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.7275 yesterday. The currency appreciated 0.1 percent this
week.  The central bank didn’t buy dollars in the  spot market 
today, it said on its website.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell two basis points to 5.55
percent, taking the weekly decline to 10 basis points, according
to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
