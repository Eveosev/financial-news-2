Coal imports by  India â€™s power
utilities were 91 percent below a state-set target in the first
quarter of the year ending March 2012, India Coal Market Watch
said, citing minister of state for power, K.C. Venugopal.  Imports totaled 12.53 million metric tons, according to the
coal newsletter. Utilities must import 55 million tons for the
fiscal year to avoid shortages, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
