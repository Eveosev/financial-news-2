Tanzania,  East Africa ’s second-
biggest economy, aims to relieve electricity shortages by
promoting geothermal energy as the country looks for sources of
renewable power.  “We are moving toward more environmentally friendly
sources of energy as our demand increases,” Energy and Minerals
Deputy Minister Adam Malima said today in an interview in
Nairobi. “We are looking to the private sector to see if there
is interest in geothermal development.”  Drought has drained Tanzania’s main hydropower dams,
resulting in power rationing amid a 264-megawatt grid deficit,
Energy Minister William Ngeleja said on Feb. 16. Peak power
demand is expected to rise to 1,994 megawatts by 2026, compared
with 727 megawatts in 2005, according to the Geological Survey
of  Tanzania .  Tanzania is situated in the East African Rift System, where
splitting tectonic plates store an estimated 15,000-megawatts of
geothermal potential, according to a report distributed by the
United Nations Environment Program at a geothermal conference in
Nairobi. The country has as much as 650 megawatts of potential
geothermal resources in the Mbeya region, Malima said.  “If we do more work then we will discover more,” Malima
said. “The challenge is the huge investment cost in the
exploratory work.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
