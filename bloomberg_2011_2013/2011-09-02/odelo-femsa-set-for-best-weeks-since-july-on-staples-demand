Grupo Modelo SA and poultry producer
Industrias Bachoco SAB led gains this week among consumer
staples companies as demand increased for stocks that are less
vulnerable to the global economic slowdown.  The maker of Corona beer climbed 0.2 percent to 72.13 pesos
today, extending its weekly gain to 5.9 percent, the biggest
five-day advance since the period ended July 1. Bachoco, the
Celaya, Mexico-based operator of poultry farms, rose 3.4 percent
today and has gained 10 percent in the past five sessions. Coca-
Cola bottlers Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB and Arca
Continental SAB also posted gains on the week.  Labor Department data today showed employment in the U.S.,
the destination for about 80 percent of  Mexico ’s exports,
unexpectedly stagnated in August as employers became less
confident in the strength of the recovery. The jobless rate held
at 9.1 percent. Stocks slumped globally and Treasuries rallied.  “Investors are looking for defensive stocks, and these are
among the most defensive in the market,” said Karla Pena, a
Mexico City-based analyst with Corp. Actinver SAB. “People
won’t stop consuming these types of products.”  Mexico’s benchmark IPC index of 35 stocks fell for the
second day, slipping 1.4 percent to 35,134.43. Thirty-one stocks
fell while four gained.  To contact the reporters on this story:
