Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s
worst-performing currency this year, headed for the first weekly
increase in seven against the dollar as non-governmental groups
received the U.S. currency from their international financiers.  The currency of  East Africa ’s third-biggest economy
appreciated 0.3 percent to 2,812.5 per dollar by 1:33 p.m. in
the capital, Kampala, extending its advance this week to 0.4
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
has lost 18 percent against the dollar this year.  The gain is due to “beginning of the month dollar inflows
to the non-governmental sector,” Benon Okwenje, head of
 currency trading  at Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s local unit, said
by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
