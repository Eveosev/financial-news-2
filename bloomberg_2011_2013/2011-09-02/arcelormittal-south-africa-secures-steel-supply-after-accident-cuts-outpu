ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd. (ACL) , the
continent’s biggest steelmaker, secured 240,000 metric tons of
steel to supply to customers after an accident at its Newcastle
mill cut output.  Some of the steel has been sourced locally, while most will
come from ArcelorMittal mills around the world, the company said
in an e-mailed statement today. “This will go a long way toward
meeting the domestic demand for commercial grade long steel
products such as rebar,” the company said.  A structural failure at its gas cleaning plant in Newcastle
on Aug. 5 is expected to cut output by 400,000 metric tons, the
company said earlier. Prices for long products, which accounted
for nearly a third of the company’s sales last year, will rise
by between 300 rand ($42.43) and 600 rand a ton in October, the
steelmaker said today.  ArcelorMittal (MT)   South Africa  fell 4.1 percent to 59.70 rand
by the 5 p.m. close of Johannesburg trading, the biggest daily
decline since July 27. The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index
closed 1.8 percent lower.  The steelmaker’s Newcastle plant is the biggest producer of
long products in South Africa and serves mainly the mining,
engineering, automotive, building, construction and agricultural
industries, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
