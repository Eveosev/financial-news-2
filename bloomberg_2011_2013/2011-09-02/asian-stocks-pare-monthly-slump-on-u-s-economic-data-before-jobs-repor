Asian stocks rose this week, with a
regional benchmark index paring the biggest monthly slump since
May 2010, as exporters and commodity producers climbed on
optimism the U.S. and Chinese economies are recovering.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes to Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., jumped 4.9 percent in  Hong Kong  after U.S. reports
showing higher factory orders and consumer spending tempered
concern that an economic recovery is faltering. Jiangxi Copper
Co. advanced 10 percent as Chinese manufacturing expanded.
Stocks fell Sept. 2 ahead of a U.S. jobs report that showed
employment growth stagnated in August, paring the MSCI  Asia 
Pacific Index’s greatest weekly gain since March.  “Concern about the health of the  U.S. economy  was near the
top of the laundry list of worries for investors,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage the equivalent of $1.1 billion at
Platypus Asset Management Ltd. in Sydney. “If the data keeps
reinforcing the idea that a new recession is unlikely, markets
could rally strongly this quarter. The latest manufacturing data
confirms that  China ’s economy was never headed for a hard
landing.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 3.2 percent this week to
124.16, extending last week’s 0.7 percent advance. The gauge
tumbled 14 percent in the previous four weeks as equity indexes
in  Australia , Hong Kong and Shanghai entered so-called bear
markets, tumbling at least 20 percent from their peaks. The
stocks rout was fueled by concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is
worsening and after a U.S. credit rating downgrade by  Standard &
Poor’s .  S&P 500 , Stoxx 600  Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at about 12.2
times estimated earnings on average, compared with 11.7 times
for the S&P 500 and 9.7 times for the Stoxx 600.  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average gained 1.7 percent this
week and South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  jumped 5 percent. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index advanced 1 percent in Sydney.  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  surged 3.2 percent. The Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies listed in Hong
Kong climbed 3.5 percent after a report showed the nation’s
manufacturing expanded at a faster pace in August. Chinese
manufacturing increased from a 29-month low, indicating that the
economy is withstanding attempts to cool prices.  China’s government has raised  interest rates  five times
since the start of 2010 and boosted reserve requirements for
banks to help control inflation. Stabilizing prices is the
country’s top priority and the government doesn’t plan to alter
the direction of economic policies, Premier Wen Jiabao said in
an article that appeared Sept. 1 on the website of the Communist
Party’s Qiushi magazine.  Economic Growth  China stock indexes may rise less than earlier estimated
this year, Credit Suisse Group AG analysts wrote in a report
this week, citing slower economic and corporate earnings growth.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index estimate was lowered to
13,000 from 15,000.  Asian stocks climbed this week after reports showed U.S.
 consumer spending  and car sales increased, while business
activity and factory orders expanded at a faster pace than
economists forecast. That bolstered gains after Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said Aug. 26 that the nation’s central
bank has more means to prop up growth if required.  The MSCI Asia Pacific index pared gains on Sept. 2 ahead of
a report that showed the U.S. jobless rate remained at 9.1
percent, and after UBS AG lowered its year-end target for the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index Excluding Japan Index by 13 percent. The
bank said equities remain “broadly out of favor” amid signs
global economic growth is slowing.  U.S. Revenue  Li & Fung, which gets about 65 percent of its revenue in
the U.S., gained 4.9 percent to HK$13.84 in Hong Kong this week.
 Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) , Asia’s largest international
carrier, rose 3.7 percent to HK$15.74.  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , a building materials supplier
that gets almost 68 percent of sales from the U.S., gained 4.9
percent to A$6.03 in Sydney. Honda climbed 2.5 percent to 2,507
yen in  Tokyo , and South Korean exporter Samsung Electronics Co.
jumped 5.9 percent to 769,000 won.  Mining and energy stocks advanced as New York-traded crude
oil climbed 1.3 percent in the week, while the London Metal
Index of prices for six metals, including copper and aluminum,
advanced 0.4 percent.  Rio Tinto Group added 4.2 percent to A$72.05 in Sydney and
 BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company and
Australia’s biggest oil producer, rose 1 percent to A$39.04. In
Hong Kong, Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s No. 1 producer of the
metal, gained 10 percent to HK$21.95 and Chinese oil explorer
 Cnooc Ltd. (883)  surged 7.2 percent to HK$15.44.  Coal Producer  Among other Asian stocks that rose this week, China Shenhua
Energy Co., a unit of the country’s largest coal producer,
advanced 2.7 percent to HK$34.75 after reporting higher profit.
 Shimao Property Holdings Ltd. (813) , a China-based developer, advanced
14 percent to HK$8.55 after first-half net income increased 57
percent from a year earlier.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a maker of industrial robots, gained 2.5
percent to 12,570 yen in Tokyo after JPMorgan Chase & Co, named
the company its “top pick” among Japanese machinery
manufacturers whose earning may benefit from growth in emerging
markets.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , which counts China as its biggest market,
increased 5.1 percent to 2,086 yen after the investment bank
gave it a new “overweight” rating.  Belle International Holdings Ltd. (1880) , China’s largest retailer
of women’s shoes, climbed 5.2 percent to HK$16.22 in Hong Kong
on optimism the mainland’s economy is withstanding anti-
inflation measures after a Chinese manufacturing index climbed
to 50.9 in August from 50.7 in July.  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) , the
nation’s biggest Internet company by revenue, advanced 6.8
percent to HK$187.30.  “The manufacturing data will remove concerns the slowdown
in economic growth will be dramatic,” said  Li Jun , a strategist
at Central China Securities Co. in Shanghai. “The economic
slowdown will be moderate this year and that will provide
support for stocks.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
