Paolo Scaroni,  Eni Spa (ENI) ’s chief
executive officer, said he’s been assured by  Libya ’s National
Transitional Council that Qaddafi-era oil contracts will be
respected, the Wall Street Journal reported.  In an interview with the newspaper, Scaroni said there’s no
evidence of vandalism at Eni’s production facilities in Libya,
though vehicles, pumps and generators have been removed and some
mine-clearance may be necessary.  He said he’s confident the company can get its oil and gas
fields operating soon and Libyan oil production should be back
to its pre-crisis level by the end of next year at the latest,
the Journal reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
