Zambia will probably exceed its tax
collection target of 16 trillion kwacha ($3.2 billion) this year
due to increased revenue from the mining industry, said Wisdom
Nekairo, the commissioner-general of the Zambia Revenue
Authority.  “We will exceed the target by about 1 trillion kwacha,”
Nekairo said in a phone interview today from Lusaka, the
capital. “Mines revenue will account for most of this money,”
he said.  Export revenue for Zambia,  Africa ’s biggest copper
producer, may increase 40 percent to $10.2 billion this year,
according to the central bank. Earnings from copper shipments is
forecast to jump 46 percent to $8.4 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
