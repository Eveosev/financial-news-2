OAO  Tatneft (TATN)  and OAO Bashneft, the
oil producer owned by Russian billionaire Vladimir
Yevtushenkovâ€™s AFK Sistema, may get exemptions from the
extraction tax on high viscosity oil,  Interfax said , citing
Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko yesterday.  The state is considering how to compensate the companies,
which stand to lose when Russia raises the export tax on heavy
refined products such as  fuel oil  in October, Interfax said
citing Shmatko.  To contact the reporter on this story:
