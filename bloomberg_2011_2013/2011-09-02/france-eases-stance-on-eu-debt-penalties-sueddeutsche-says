France  is easing its resistance to
possible penalties for euro-area countries that run excessive
budget deficits,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing a French
proposal submitted to the European Union in Brussels.  France is proposing to let EU countries vote by a simple
majority to impose sanctions, with one vote per government,
rather than a “qualified majority” in which bigger EU
countries have a greater voting share, the Munich, Germany-based
newspaper  reported  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
