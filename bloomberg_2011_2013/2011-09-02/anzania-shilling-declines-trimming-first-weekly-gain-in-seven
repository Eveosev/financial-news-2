Tanzania’s shilling retreated,
paring its first weekly gain in seven against the dollar, as
banks increased demand for the greenback.  The currency of  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy
depreciated 0.1 percent to 1,621.5 per dollar by 12:10 p.m. in
Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital, trimming its increase
this week to 0.1 percent.  “It is interbank trading that’s moving the market, with
more demand for dollars, hence the depreciation of the
shilling,” Zainul Chandoo, head treasurer at Standard Bank
Group Ltd.’s local unit, said by phone today. “But the market
is generally subdued today because companies just came back”
from the Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday, he said.  Tanzania’s shilling has slumped 8.5 percent this year,
making it Africa’s third-worst performer against the dollar
after Uganda and  Kenya ’s currencies. The shilling weakened as
Tanzania’s inflation rate climbed to 13 percent in July, the
fastest pace in 15 months, on higher on higher energy and food
costs, the National Bureau of Statistics said Aug. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
