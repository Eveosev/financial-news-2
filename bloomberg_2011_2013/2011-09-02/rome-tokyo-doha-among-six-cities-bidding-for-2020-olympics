Former hosts Rome and  Tokyo  will be
joined by Doha, Madrid, Istanbul and Baku in Azerbaijan, in
bidding for the 2020 Olympic Summer Games, the  International
Olympic Committee  said.  The IOC will vote on the site of the 2020 Games in  Buenos
Aires  in September 2013, the ruling body said in a statement on
its website.  The 1960 Olympics were held in Rome, with Tokyo serving as
host four years later. Madrid was a finalist for the 2016 Games,
losing out to Rio de Janeiro in 2009.  The Qatar Olympic Committee was given the green light to
bid for the 2020 Olympics in Doha after the IOC executive board
last week approved its proposal to hold the Games between Sept.
20 and Oct. 20. The IOCâ€™s preferred window to host the Summer
Games is between July 15 and Aug. 31.  Qatar won the right to host the 2022 soccer  World Cup  in
December.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
