AFL-CIO President  Richard
Trumka , in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Political
Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend,
said he’s optimistic President Barack Obama will propose a
multitrillion-dollar job-creation program next week.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot

president of the AFL-CIO, who joins us here in the studio.
Thank you so much for being with us on the eve of Labor Day,
Mr. President.  RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AFL-CIO: Al, thanks for
having me on, and happy Labor Day.  HUNT: Well, happy Labor Day to you. You didn’t have a
very happy Labor Day on Friday, when those jobs numbers came
out. No growth at all. This recovery looks like it’s over.  TRUMKA: It really is. It’s starting to fizzle. It’s
what we’ve been saying. You can’t focus on cut, cut, cut and
manufacturing a debt crisis and not do anything to create
jobs or spur the economy and expect this thing to grow.  So we’re disappointed, but the consequences of the
pretty radical political games that have been played up
here, particularly in the  House of Representatives , are
starting to come home to roost right now.  HUNT: Well, it’s going to be joined next week, when the
president is going to address a joint session of Congress
about jobs. We know the AFL-CIO wants a $4 trillion
infrastructure among - program, among other things. Now,
you’re not going to get all that. You know that. But the
president is going to propose something on infrastructure,
something on taxes, something on U.I.  But tell me, what will delineate whether it’s just sort
of business as usual and routine or ambitious? What do you
need to see from him specifically that makes it bold?  TRUMKA: Size, scale and determination.  HUNT: How big?  TRUMKA: Well, it has to be big enough to hit the
problem. And, look, when you said the AFL-CIO wants a $4
trillion program, that’s not me. The American Society of
Civil Engineers say that, on old infrastructure, we have a
$2.2 trillion deficit. On new infrastructure - that’s stuff
to get us into the 21st century - smart grid, the high-speed
rail, we need another $2 trillion. So it has to be something
on the scale to get us at that level.  HUNT: So it has to be, what, at least, say, $2.5
trillion, $3 trillion at least?  TRUMKA: Oh, no. We’re talking about over 10 years.  HUNT: Right.  TRUMKA: So if you’re looking at $400 billion over a
year for a number of years, that gets us in the ballpark.
Because, look, the longer we wait, Al, to correct the
infrastructure that’s decaying right now, the more
difficult, costly, and less competitive as a nation we
become.  HUNT: Just to make sure. Anything less than $4 trillion
would be disappointing to you then?  TRUMKA: Well, we’re talking about over 10 years.  HUNT: Over 10 years, that’s what I mean.  TRUMKA: Yeah, so I said about $400 billion -  HUNT: And that would be disappointing if it’s less than
that?  TRUMKA: Well, we’re looking at that. That’s the program
that needs to be. But that’s not the only thing,
infrastructure. There has to be other components to it. So
you could have a little less here and a little more here.
You need to have five or six components in it. One, you have
to - you have to do infrastructure.  HUNT: Infrastructure.  TRUMKA: And that has to be done. The surface
transportation reauthorization, the FAA, clean water, all of
those things.  HUNT: Any tax? Do you want any tax measures at all?  TRUMKA: Well, there has to be revenue increases down
the road, if you’re -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: But I’m talking about tax - anything, job-
producing tax credits or write-offs now?  TRUMKA: Well, some of those things help around the
edges, but they don’t -  HUNT: But they’re not the big deal?  TRUMKA: They don’t create the - and give you the
economic activity and do a  job creation . Think about this.
You’re not hiring a worker. Somebody says I’ll give you a 2
percent cut on the tax you pay on that worker, you’re
automatically going to hire a bunch of workers. It will
help. It has to be with other things, that’s what I’m
saying. There’s a number of things that have to come
together.  HUNT: You talked earlier about all the hassling over
deficits and cuts. The president’s been right in the middle
of that. Why do you have any confidence he’s going to
deliver now, when he hasn’t all year?  TRUMKA: I think he understands what the real problem is
right now.  HUNT: When did that - when did that happen? When did he
change?  TRUMKA: I think he’s understood that all along. I don’t
think it’s a new revelation. I think he tried. He tried with
the stimulus package. The Republicans wouldn’t go with it on
the size it needed to be. He tried with other things. They
won’t do anything.  Their idea is to cut, cut, cut, cut. And you can’t get
there by cutting. We really do need to create jobs. You want
to eliminate the deficit, Al? Create jobs and the deficit
goes away.  HUNT: President Trumka, you know bargaining. How would
you rate  Barack Obama  as a negotiator?  TRUMKA: I’d say he needs to take another course in
bargaining to help out. All of us can use - to have our -
stand to have our skills increased, including me. That would
include him, too.  HUNT: So you would - you would send him back to school
on bargaining?  TRUMKA: I’d go with him.  (LAUGHTER)  HUNT: Let me ask you about two political predicates.
One is that Obama has dispirited the base, that -
particularly working-class Democrats - with a lack of focus
on jobs and a compelling policy. The other is that, hey,
with  Rick Perry  or Mitt Romney, hey, he’s home-free, that
automatically energizes the Democratic base. Which is closer
to the truth?  TRUMKA: I think some of the things he’s done have
caused a dampening the spirit of the base. But I don’t think
you could take either  Mitt Romney  or Rick Perry for granted.
I would say that you still have to run a campaign. And he
has to do what he needs to do.  Look, American workers, whether they’re union or not
union, are looking for leadership. They don’t want talk.
They don’t want excuses. They don’t want bipartisan crap.
They want somebody that’ll stand up and say, “Here’s the
problem. This is what it’ll take to fix it. And I’m going to
fight for that.”  HUNT: Do you think he’ll - do you think he’ll be bold
next Thursday?  TRUMKA: I do.  HUNT: You do?  TRUMKA: I do.  HUNT: So you’re really optimistic about it?  TRUMKA: I am optimistic about it. I’m hoping that he’ll
be very bold. He’ll stand up for the American worker and
say: This is what needs to be done to fix the problem, and
I’m going to fight for it.  HUNT: You’re setting up a super PAC. Are all the other
unions participating now? How much do you expect to raise?
And are you going to give to other Democratic political
action committees?  (CROSSTALK)  TRUMKA: Here’s what we’re doing. In the past, we’ve
built a structure six months, nine months before the
election. And on Election Day, we dismantled it. Now we’re
going to build a structure that stays in place 12 months a
year, every year. And in between elections, we will continue
to expand and reach out and bring allies and friends into
that.  HUNT: Will you give to other Democratic PACs? Are you
going to just -  TRUMKA: Our - our PAC is going to be used to create the
structure for working people.  HUNT: So that’s where all your money is going to go?  TRUMKA: That’s exactly where it’s going to go.  HUNT: So it’s not going to go into other PACs?  TRUMKA: It’s going to build a PAC for working people -  HUNT: But I’m right. It’s not - you’re not going to be
given other PACs?  TRUMKA: That will speak to union and non-union workers
out there. That’s what it will do.  HUNT: Can you envision next year - I know you’re not
going to support Democrats who haven’t supported labor. Have
you figured out - have you blackballed any specific Democrat
yet? And can you imagine any Republican in a Senate or
governor’s race that you would give to next year?  TRUMKA: Well, look, we don’t - I don’t make those
decisions. Everybody thinks I sit down there and make all
the decisions.  HUNT: But you have some influence.  TRUMKA: Well, I do have some influence, but the
decisions actually get made in the states on the reps in
that state. And so we’ll sit down with our state people, our
rank-and-file, make those decisions, see if they get the
requisite amount of support. Are there Republicans that we
can support? You bet. There’s Republicans in  Ohio  that stood
up with us in the fight against Kasich.  HUNT: State legislators, right?  TRUMKA: We’ll be standing -  (CROSSTALK)  HUNT: But no statewide candidate that you see now for
governor or for senator?  TRUMKA: None jumps to mind.  HUNT: None jumps to mind.  Charlie Cook  says that you’ve
had to devote so many resources to fending off Republican
efforts to emasculate unions in places like Ohio,  Wisconsin ,
 New Jersey , that that’s going to siphon off money for
engagement in congressional and presidential elections.  TRUMKA: Well, it doesn’t help. But here’s what it did
do. It energized our base.  HUNT: Right.  TRUMKA: And after  Rick Scott  attacked us in Wisconsin,
we were going to -  HUNT: Rick Scott in  Florida .  TRUMKA: Sorry -  HUNT:  Scott Walker  in -  TRUMKA: Scott Walker, excuse me, thank you. Scott
Walker - how could I ever confuse those two? Scott Walker
attacked the workers out there. We organized nine new
hospitals. We brought 30,000 new members into working
America. We have 10 unions in there right now that are
organizing. We’re going to come out of that fight a lot
bigger and a lot stronger than we went into it.  HUNT: You like your enemies. Let me ask you this. Labor
is unhappy with the selection of  Charlotte  for the
Democratic convention. It’s a non-union town. In the past,
not the last couple conventions, but in the past, you’ve
been a delegate, I think from  Pennsylvania . Are you going to
be a delegate in Charlotte next year?  TRUMKA: I don’t know.  HUNT: What do you think?  TRUMKA: We’ll have to see. I don’t know the answer to
that yet. If I do, I’ll have to run like everybody else.  HUNT: Right.  TRUMKA: And we’ll see if we do that. We haven’t made a
decision. Some unions will participate. Some won’t.  HUNT: But you’re going to be in Charlotte one way or -
whether you’re a delegate or not?  TRUMKA: I haven’t made that decision yet.  HUNT: You haven’t made your mind up yet?  TRUMKA: No.  HUNT: All right. Well, we’ll be - when you do, will you
tell us?  TRUMKA: Oh, sure. Absolutely.  HUNT: President -  TRUMKA: I’ll send that over to you. “Hey, Al.”  HUNT: President Trumka, very, very happy Labor Day to
you. Thank you for being here.  TRUMKA: Happy Labor Day to you, buddy.  HUNT: Thank you, sir. And when we come back, pressure
mounts on the president’s jobs speech, and the White House
and speaker play tug-of-war for primetime spotlight.
