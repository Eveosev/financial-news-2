Philippine  government bonds  rose,
with 10-year yields dropping to a record low, on speculation
inflation slowed last month. The peso advanced.  Ten-year notes rallied for a fifth day before the
government report on Sept. 6 that will show consumer prices rose
5 percent from a year earlier, compared with an increase of 5.1
percent in July, according to the median forecast of analysts in
a Bloomberg survey. The economy expanded 3.4 percent in the
three months ended June, the least since 2009, official data
showed this week.  “The threat of higher  interest rates  has dissipated,”
said Bunny Bernardo-Recto, vice president at Manila-based
Chinatrust Philippines Commercial Bank Corp. “The market is
expecting a dovish tone from the central bank as fragile global
conditions call for low rates to ensure growth.”  The yield on the 7.375 percent bonds due March 2021 fell
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.64 percent as
of 4:24 p.m., according to Tradition Financial Services. The
rate dropped to 5.62 percent earlier, the lowest level since at
least 1998, when Bloomberg started compiling the data. The yield
fell 13 basis points this week.  The peso gained 0.2 percent today and 0.7 percent this week
to 42.145 per dollar, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It
touched 42.143 today, the strongest since Aug. 4.  Slowing growth will “moderate” inflation, which policy
makers will take into account when they meet next week, Deputy
Governor Diwa Guinigundo said on Aug. 31. The central bank kept
the overnight borrowing rate at 4.5 percent in the last two
meetings and instead asked lenders to set aside more money as
reserves.  The government may revise its growth target for this year,
BusinessWorld reported, citing Economic Planning Secretary
Cayetano Paderanga. Policy makers have forecast the economy,
which expanded 7.6 percent last year, will grow 7 percent to 8
percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
