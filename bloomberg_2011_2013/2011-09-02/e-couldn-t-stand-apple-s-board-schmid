Google Inc. (GOOG)  Chairman Eric Schmidt
said his company’s planned $12.5 billion purchase of smartphone
maker Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. was aimed at acquiring
products, and not merely patents.  “We did it for more than just patents,” Schmidt said in a
conversation with Salesforce.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer
Marc Benioff. “The Motorola team has some amazing products.”  The deal was aimed at helping Mountain View, California-
based Google expand in smartphones in a rivalry with  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ,
maker of the iPhone. The deal brings more than 17,000 patents
Google can use to protect its Android operating system.  Schmidt also praised former Apple CEO  Steve Jobs , who
stepped down last week, and said that he’s “proud” of his
stint as an Apple director.  “It’s certainly the best performance of a CEO in 50
years,” Schmidt said of Jobs. “We’ve all benefited from the
tremendous innovation at Apple. And I say this as a very proud
former board member at Apple.”  Schmidt was on Apple’s board while he was CEO of Google. He
exited in August 2009 as rivalry between the two companies
accelerated. Google’s expansion into computer and mobile-phone
software yielded direct competitors to Apple’s products,
including the iPhone, which was introduced in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
