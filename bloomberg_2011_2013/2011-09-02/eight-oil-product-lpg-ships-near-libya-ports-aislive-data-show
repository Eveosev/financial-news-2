Following is a list of six oil-
product tankers and two liquefied petroleum gas carriers near
Libyan ports, according to ship-tracking data from AISLive Ltd.
compiled by Bloomberg.  Rebels opposing  Muammar Qaddafi  received three to four
cargoes of gasoline a month in June and July, while the now-
ousted national leader got none, according to two traders, a
ship owner, an analyst and a shipbroker surveyed by Bloomberg
during those months.  Libya ’s oil exports have slumped since fighting began in
February. Output plunged to 60,000 barrels a day in July,
compared with 1.7 million barrels in January, according to the
Paris-based  International Energy Agency , which advises 28
developed nations on  energy policy . Libya holds  Africa ’s largest
crude reserves.  DWT denotes vessel capacity measured in deadweight tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
