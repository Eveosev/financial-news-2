(Corrects plant’s capacity in third paragraph. The story
was initially published on Sept. 2.)  Dangote Cement Plc (DANGCEM) ,  Africa ’s biggest
producer of the building material, will start production at its
Ibese plant in southwestern Nigeria this month, Chief Executive
Officer Devakumar Edwin said.  The company will add an additional  production line  at its
Obajana plant in central Nigeria in the fourth quarter, Edwin
said on a conference call from Lagos today.  “By the end of the first quarter of next year, both plants
will be operating at 90 percent of capacity,” Edwin said.
Obajana will have the capacity to produce an additional 5
million metric tons of cement, or twice its current capacity of
5 million tons, while Ibese has a capacity for 6 million tons,
he said.  Dangote Cement is the biggest company by market value on
the  Nigerian Stock Exchange  with a capitalization of 1.61
trillion naira ($10.4 billion). The company expects its total
annual production capacity to rise to 50 million tons in the
next five years, it said on April 13.  The stock was unchanged at 104 naira by the 2:30 p.m. close
