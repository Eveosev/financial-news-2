Copper fell the most in two weeks
after a report showed employment in the U.S. unexpectedly
stagnated last month, fueling concern that a weaker economy may
reduce demand for industrial materials.  The  unemployment rate  remained at 9.1 percent and payrolls
were unchanged, the weakest reading since September 2010, after
a gain of 85,000 jobs in July that was less than initially
estimated, Labor Department data showed today in Washington. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for a rise of
65,000. Hourly earnings and hours worked both declined.  “Copper is going to continue to be under pressure today
based on the U.S. jobs number, which was abysmal by anybody’s
recollection,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated
Brokerage Services in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  Copper futures for December delivery declined 6.45 cents,
or 1.6 percent, to $4.0965 a pound at 9:32 a.m. on the Comex in
 New York . A close at that price would mark the biggest decline
since Aug. 18. On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery
in three months retreated $115, or 1.3 percent, to $9,030 a
metric ton ($4.10 a pound).  Lead, aluminum, zinc, nickel and tin also fell in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
