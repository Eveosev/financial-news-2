Agroton Public Ltd. (AGT) , an agricultural
producer in Ukraine, said first-half profit climbed 22 percent
on higher sales.  Net income climbed to $34.2 million, from $28.1 million a
year earlier, the company, which is based in Luhansk in the
eastern part of Ukraine, said in an e-mailed statement today.  Crop sales revenue more than tripled on higher average
sunflower and wheat selling prices and higher sales volumes of
the crops, Agroton said in the statement.  “We will continue to drive the growth in the second
half,” Chief Executive Officer Iurii Zhuravlov in the
statement.  The company may expand its existing 151,000 hectare land
bank by an additional 50,000 hectares this year, Zhuravlov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
