A contract for Koch Supply & Trading
Co. to hire a supertanker from Copenhagen-based A.P. Moeller-
Maersk A/S for storing crude oil at sea was canceled, according
to Optima Shipbrokers Ltd.  Yesterday’s booking of the Maersk Nautilus at a daily rate
of $16,000 for a period of one to six months was scrapped,
Optima said in a report e-mailed today. Katie Stavinoha,
director of public affairs at Koch, declined to comment when
contacted by telephone.  A supertanker, or very large crude carrier, can hold about
2 million barrels of crude. The Maersk Nautilus has a carrying
capacity of 307,000 deadweight tons, according to Optima.  To contact the reporter on this story:
