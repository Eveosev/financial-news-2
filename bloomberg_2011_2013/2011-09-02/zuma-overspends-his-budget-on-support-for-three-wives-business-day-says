South African President  Jacob Zuma 
overspent the budget allocated to him by a third because of the
costs of supporting his three wives, his children and travel,
Business Day said, citing the presidencyâ€™s annual report.  The presidency spent 89.5 million rand ($12.8 million) on
support for Zuma compared with the 66.8 million rand budgeted
and the 42.9 million rand spent in fiscal 2010, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
