U.K. stocks tumbled the most in two
weeks, led by a selloff in banks and commodity producers, after
a worse-than-forecast U.S. jobs report added to concern that the
country’s economic recovery may be at risk.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  led a selloff in banks, tumbling more than 8
percent as European sovereign default risk climbed to a record.
 Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  and BP Plc led commodity companies lower as metal
and oil prices dropped.  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  slid 3.7 percent after
reporting study results for its best-selling drug.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  dropped 126.62, or 2.3
percent, to 5,292.03 at the 4:30 p.m. close. in London, its
biggest decline since Aug. 18. The FTSE All-Share Index sank 2.2
percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index slid 2.7 percent.  The employment data “badly missed market expectations in
August to show complete stagnation,” said Joshua Raymond, chief
market strategist at  City Index  in  London . “With no jobs
created, it adds yet more pressure on the  Federal Reserve  to re-
ignite the U.S. economic recovery.”  The gauge has still climbed 3.2 percent this week after
last month’s 7.2 percent selloff dragged equities to their
cheapest valuation as a multiple of estimated earnings since
March 2009. Fed minutes earlier this week showed some policy
makers wanted to add to stimulus measures to drive the economy.  Today’s report showed U.S. employment unexpectedly
stagnated in August as employers became less confident in the
strength of the recovery.  Payrolls were unchanged last month after an 85,000 gain in
July that was less than initially estimated. That missed the
median economist forecast of 68,000 in a Bloomberg News survey.
Hourly earnings and hours worked both declined.  U.S. Hourly Earnings  “Equally troubling could be the fact that average working
hours fell which could indicate that companies are trying to
scale back employment costs,” Raymond said. “We will need to
see more evidence of a stagnation and potential contraction in
the U.S. jobs market for the case for a double-dip recession to
strengthen.”  Barclays slumped 8.4 percent to 165.2 pence, halting a
three-day rally.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  slid 7.1 percent to
33.12 pence and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  dropped 5.4
percent to 24.84 pence.  Banks fell as the Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index
of credit-default swaps insuring the debt of 15 governments
surpassed an all-time high, rising to 311 earlier today, after
the U.S. jobs report added to signs that the global economic
recovery is weakening.  Kazakhmys led mining companies lower, sinking 3.4 percent
to 1,040 pence as base metals extended declines.  Xstrata Plc (XTA) 
lost 3.2 percent to 1,018.5 pence and Rio Tinto Group retreated
2.5 percent to 3,674 pence.  BP, Shell Slide  BP fell 3.6 percent to 374.4 pence and Royal Dutch Shell
Plc declined 1.9 percent to 2,036.5 pence as crude oil tumbled
in  New York . Separately, the oil companies began evacuating
workers from platforms and rigs in the Gulf of Mexico as a storm
intensified in the largest U.S. crude-producing region.  AstraZeneca retreated 3.7 percent to 2,809.5 pence after
the drugmaker reported that its Crestor treatment for
cholesterol didn’t reach statistical significance in lowering
arterial plaque as a percentage volume, the study’s main measure
of effectiveness.  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  slipped 2.3 percent to 911
pence, falling for the first time in nine trading days. The U.K.
bourse is holding talks with LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd. to buy the
world’s biggest clearinghouse for swaps.  Randgold Resources Ltd. paced advancing shares on the FTSE
100, rallying 4.3 percent to 6,670 pence as gold prices extended
gains in New York after the U.S. jobs report boosted demand for
the precious metal as a haven.  To contact the reporter on this story:
