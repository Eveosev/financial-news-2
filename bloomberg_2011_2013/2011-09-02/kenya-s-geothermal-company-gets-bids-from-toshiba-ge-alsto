Kenya’s state-owned  Geothermal
Development Co.  said it received bids from 19 companies to
develop eight, 100-megawatt steam-powered electricity plants at
the Bogoria-Silali block in the country’s northwest.  Companies that placed tenders include  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) ,
 Alstom SA (ALO)  based in France,  General Electric Co. (GE)  in the U.S., and
 Toshiba Corp. (6502) , Silas Simiyu, the company’s chief executive
officer, said in an interview in Nairobi today.  The company plans to select a different company to build
each of the eight facilities once investors in the project
including the World Bank gives GDC the go-ahead, he said.  “We want them to compete against each other to get the
plants up,” Simiyu said. Construction of the power plants is
expected to start as early as January and be completed in 2017
at a cost of 291 billion shillings ($3.1 billion), GDC’s chief
geologist John Lagat said on June 27.  Kenya , Africa’s largest geothermal producer, is scaling up
its search for underground steam deposits with a $2.6 billion,
10-year plan to sink 566 wells at the Olkaria, Menengai and
Bogoria-Silali sites. The country has an estimated geothermal
potential of 7,000 megawatts to 10,000 megawatts, according to
GDC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
