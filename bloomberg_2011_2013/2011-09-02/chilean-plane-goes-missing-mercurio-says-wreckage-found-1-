A Chilean plane went missing near
the Juan Fernandez archipelago, Defense Minister Andres Allamand
said in a televised statement.  The plane tried to land twice before contact was lost,
Allamand said. “The scenario we face is particularly adverse,”
he said.  Wreckage has been found in the area, El Mercurio newspaper
 reported , citing local mayor Leopoldo Gonzalez. The missing
plane carried 21 passengers, Mercurio said.  The executive director of TVN, Mauro Valdes, said Chilean
television presenter Felipe Camiroaga was on the missing plane,
according to comments broadcast on Radio Cooperativa.  Felipe Cubillos, who ran a charity dedicated to
reconstruction following  Chile ’s earthquake on Feb. 27 last
year, may also have been on the plane, El Mercurio reported.  The three-island Juan Fernandez archipelago, 420 miles west
of the city of Valparaiso, includes Robinson Crusoe Island.  To contact the reporter on this story:
