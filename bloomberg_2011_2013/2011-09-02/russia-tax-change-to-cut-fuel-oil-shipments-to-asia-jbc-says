Russia’s new export taxes will
“radically” change the country’s crude and refined product
exports, spurring shipments of Urals to  Asia  and discouraging
 fuel oil  flows, JBC Energy GmbH said.  “For Asia, this means that importers of Russian fuel oil
will increasingly have to look elsewhere for product cargoes,”
analysts at the Vienna-based researcher said in a note
distributed today. “Middle Eastern producers may have to deal
with an uptick in arbitrage cargoes of medium-sour crude out of
 Europe .”  Russia’s so-called 60-66 tax structure will be effective
from Oct. 1. The formula was designed to spur investments in oil
production by lowering the crude export tax, using a coefficient
of 60 percent instead of 65 percent, while taxing exports of
refined products at 66 percent of the crude levy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
