Shareholders of  Oceanic Bank
International Plc (OCEANIC) , a Nigerian lender that was bailed out by the
central bank in 2009, will meet on Sept. 27 to decide on a plan
by  Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI)  to acquire it.  Investors will discuss the transfer of 55 billion naira
($355 million) worth of shares to Lome, Togo-based Ecobank
Transnational, the lender that operates in more than 30 African
nations, according to an e-mailed statement from Oceanic.  Shareholders will also decide how much stock will remain in
the hands of current investors in the Lagos-based lender and
approve giving shares worth 290 billion naira to the Asset
Management Corp. of  Nigeria , known as Amcon, in order to bring
shareholders’ funds from negative to zero.  Oceanic Bank was among eight lenders whose chief executives
were fired by the  Central Bank of Nigeria  in 2009 after a
lending crisis threatened to collapse some of the country’s
financial institutions.  The central bank bailed out the lenders with 620 billion
naira and created Amcon to buy non-performing loans of the banks
to enable them to rebuild their balance sheets and resume
lending. It gave the banks a Sept. 30 deadline this year to
recapitalize or face liquidation or nationalization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
