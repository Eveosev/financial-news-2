Chicago Cubs pitcher Carlos Zambrano
won’t play again this season after his 30-day suspension ends
next week, the Major League Baseball team announced.  Zambrano, 30, will be paid and won’t play when he becomes
eligible to return to the team on Sept. 11, the Cubs announced
on their website. The three-time All Star was placed on the
disqualified list and suspended for 30 days without pay after
being ejected in an Aug. 12 loss to  Atlanta Braves .  Zambrano was tossed from the game when he threw a pair of
inside pitches to Chipper Jones after giving up five home runs.
Zambrano cleaned out his locker during the game and told team
personnel that he was retiring, according to ESPN.  A native of  Venezuela , Zambrano has won 125 games in his
11-year career with the Cubs, including a league-high 16 wins in
2006 and a no-hitter on Sept. 14, 2008. He was 9-7 with a 4.82
earned-run average when he was suspended.  Zambrano is due $18 million next season in the final
guaranteed year of his contract, the team said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
