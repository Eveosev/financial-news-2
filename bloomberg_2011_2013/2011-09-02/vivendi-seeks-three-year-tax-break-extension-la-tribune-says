French media group  Vivendi SA (VIV)  has
asked French tax authorities to extend for another three years
a tax treatment that allows it to deduct overseas losses from
its French tax bill,  La Tribune  reported, citing comments from
Finance Director Philippe Capron to analysts.  The so-called “global consolidation benefit,” which is
used by just five companies, was due to expire for the media
group at the end of this year, La Tribune said. Capron said he
hasn’t heard yet from tax authorities about his request to
extend it to 2014, the business daily reported.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
