The Swiss government said all five
ruling-coalition parties support measures taken by the central
bank to weaken the franc and protect the economy.  At a meeting in Bern today, government members and all
party leaders welcomed the  Swiss National Bank ’s measures,
according to an e-mailed  statement . Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann informed participants about the economic
situation, calling the  exchange rate  volatile.  The SNB last month boosted liquidity to the money market
and lowered borrowing costs to zero to fight the currency’s
ascent, which is hurting exports and economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
