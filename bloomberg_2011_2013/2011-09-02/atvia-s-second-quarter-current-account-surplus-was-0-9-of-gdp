Latvia ’s current account, a measure
of money flowing into and out of a country, recorded a surplus
of 0.9 percent of gross domestic product in the second quarter
as exports of goods and services increased.  The surplus totaled 31.8 million lati ($63.9 million) in
the April-June period, the Riga-based central bank said today in
an e-mailed statement. It was 3.6 percent of GDP in 2010.  The Baltic nation’s current account swung from a deficit of
27.1 percent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2006 to a surplus
of 1.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009 as imports collapsed
amid a recession. Latvia’s economy, which contracted 18 percent
in 2009, expanded a preliminary 5.3 percent from a year earlier
in the second quarter, the quickest pace in 3 1/2 years, as
exports and industrial production rose.  “Risks to the external economic outlook have amplified and
testify to a potential deterioration in foreign demand in the
upcoming quarters,” central bank spokesman Martins Gravitis
said in today’s statement. “It cannot be asserted, however,
that the anticipated deterioration in foreign trade fundamentals
would substantially alter the current account balance dynamics,
as global developments are expected to impact it in the opposite
direction as well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
