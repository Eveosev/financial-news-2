The  Swiss franc  extended gains
versus the dollar and euro after a report showed employment in
the U.S. unexpectedly stagnated in August.  The franc appreciated 2.7 percent against the euro to
1.10346 at 1:37 p.m. in London. It strengthened 2.6 percent to
77.46 centimes against the dollar.  U.S. payrolls were unchanged last month, the weakest
reading since September 2010, after an 85,000 gain in July that
was less than initially estimated, Labor Department data showed.
The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for a rise
of 65,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
