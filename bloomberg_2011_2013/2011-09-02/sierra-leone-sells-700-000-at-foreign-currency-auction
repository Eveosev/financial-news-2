Sierra Leone sold $700,000 at a
foreign-currency auction on Aug. 31, less than the $1 million
offered, the Central Bank of Sierra Leone said.  The average rate was 4,409 leones per dollar, the Freetown-
based bank said on its website today. The next auction will be
held on Sept. 7 and the bank will offer $1 million, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
