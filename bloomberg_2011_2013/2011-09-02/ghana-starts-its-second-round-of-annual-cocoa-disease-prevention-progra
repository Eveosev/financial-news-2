Ghana , the world’s second-biggest
cocoa producer, started its campaign to spray chemicals against
diseases and pests that hinder output amid hopes for a harvest
that may reach a second straight record.  The Ghana Cocoa Board will send a second batch of pesticide
and fungicide to farmers this month, after a first round that
began in August, said Tony Fofie, chief executive officer of the
board.  “We started in the first week of August to protect our
crops from black pod and other diseases because our world is hot
and humid,” he said in an interview in Accra, the capital,
yesterday.  The annual program by the board, known as  Cocobod , to
provide spray to farmers in the West African nation helped boost
2010-11 output to a record of more than 1 million metric tons by
Aug. 18. Good weather, fertilizer use and higher prices for
farmers also helped the harvest reach a target that was
initially forecast for the 2012-13 season. Black pod rot is a
fungus that occurs in times of heavy rain and little sunshine.  Ghana, which neighbors the world’s biggest cocoa producer
 Ivory Coast , is aiming for output in the next season of between
1.1 million tons and 1.2 million tons, Kwabena Asante-Poku,
deputy chief executive officer of the board, said Aug. 26. The
harvest is likely to start in October.  Cocoa futures for December delivery gained 0.6 percent, or
11 pounds ($17.82), to 1,956 pounds by 10:17 a.m. on the NYSE
Liffe market in  London .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
