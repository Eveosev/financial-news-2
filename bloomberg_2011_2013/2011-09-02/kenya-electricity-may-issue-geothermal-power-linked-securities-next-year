Kenya  Electricity Generation Co. is
considering issuing asset-backed securities to finance
geothermal exploration, as the country aims to install 4,700
megawatts of steam-driven power over the next two decades.  KenGen, the country’s biggest power producer, may be ready
to offer the bonds linked to geothermal resources as early as
next year should the authorities allow it, Managing Director
Eddy Njoroge said in an interview in Nairobi today.  “We are considering asset-back securities, they would trade
on the  Nairobi Stock Exchange ,” Njoroge said. “We can use steam
as an asset to raise funds for drilling. The idea is in the
development stage, but we could be ready in six months, a year.”  Kenya’s state-run  Geothermal Development Co.  estimates the
extent of its unexploited resources ranges from 7,000 megawatts
to 10,000 megawatts at 14 “high-potential” locations valued at
$30 billion.  Peak demand for electricity in Kenya has grown to 1,200
megawatts this year and is expected to hit 15,000 megawatts by
2030, Njoroge said at a conference today in Nairobi. To meet
growing demand, the country needs to install about 15,000
megawatts, a third of which will probably come from geothermal
energy, over the next 20 years, he said.  Kenya, a nation of 38.4 million people, is  East Africa ’s
biggest economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
