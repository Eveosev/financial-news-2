Hong Kong’s stocks fell for the
first time in five days, paring this week’s gains, ahead of a
report that may show U.S. employment growth has slowed, adding
to concerns the world’s largest economy is deteriorating.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes to Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., slumped 6.7 percent.  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) ,
the Hong-Kong based international carrier, slid 1.8 percent.
 Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothing retailer, tumbled 10 percent
after cutting its profit outlook. Sino Land Co., a property
developer, advanced 0.5 percent after reporting a jump in full-
year profit.  “Expectations are relatively low for tonight’s jobs
data,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion in
equities at Pengana Capital Ltd. in  Melbourne . “The U.S.
recovery remains anemic, with lingering concerns over job
creation and house prices.”  The Hang Seng Index slipped 1.8 percent to 20,212.91 as of
the 4 p.m. close of trading in  Hong Kong . Just four stocks rose
on the 46-member gauge. The measure advanced the past four days,
sending the index to a weekly gain of 3.2 percent, its biggest
increase since the week ended March 25.  The Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index of Chinese companies
listed in Hong Kong slid 2.4 percent to 10,664.45.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.6 percent
today. The index retreated 1.2 percent in  New York  yesterday as
banks fell and investors speculated that the U.S. jobs report
will show the economy continues to struggle.  U.S. Employment  Li & Fung slumped 6.7 percent to HK$13.84. The company’s
investment rating was also lowered to “outperform” from
“buy” at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets. Cathay Pacific, which
counts  North America  as its biggest market for sales, lost 1.8
percent to HK$15.74.  Foxconn International Holdings Ltd. (2038) , which
receives 24 percent of its sales outside of China, lost 0.8
percent to HK$3.92.  Stocks fell before a Labor Department report today that may
show U.S. non-farm payrolls climbed 68,000 after a 117,000
increase in July, according to the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. The  unemployment rate  probably held
at 9.1 percent, marking 26 of the last 28 months in which it has
been at or above 9 percent.  The Hang Seng Index rose for its second consecutive weekly
advance. Shares on the index traded at 10.8 times forecast
earnings, compared with 12 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  Biggest Decline  Esprit, which receives most of its revenue from  Europe ,
tumbled 10 percent to HK$19.64, the biggest decline on the  Hang
Seng index. (HSI)  The clothing retailer said net income for the fiscal
year that ended June 30 will “record a significant decrease.”
Today’s slide in Esprit’s share price extended this year’s drop
to 47 percent, the biggest loss on the Hang Seng index in the
last 12 months.  “This will likely impact fiscal year 2011’s dividend
payout,” Vineet Sharma, a Hong Kong-based analyst at  Barclays
Capital , said in a note to clients today. Esprit’s statement
“could reflect an inability to achieve timely closure for some
loss-making stores,” said Sharma, who downgraded the stock to
“equal weight” from “overweight.”  Commodity producers declined after the price of crude oil
retreated as much as 0.6 percent, down from its highest level in
almost a month, and the London Metal Exchange measure of six
metals slid 1.3 percent yesterday.  Commodity Producers  PetroChina Co., Asia’s largest company by market value,
declined 3.5 percent to HK$9.67.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s No. 1
offshore oil explorer, fell 3.3 percent to HK$15.44, the biggest
drag on the Hang Seng index. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s No. 1
producer of the metal, dropped 3.9 percent to HK$21.95.  Among stocks that gained, Sino Land advanced 0.5 percent to
HK$12.22, the second-biggest support on the Hang Seng index and
the third-steepest rise. The shares earlier rose as much as 5.3
percent. The developer said full-year underlying profit rose 26
percent after it booked more profit from apartment sales.  Of the 323 companies on the Hang Seng Composite Index that
announced semi-annual net income since July 11, 159 reported
positive growth while 70 posted a negative surprise, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index slid 1.7 percent to 20,056.
The HSI Volatility Index climbed 2.2 percent to 30.86,
indicating options traders expect a swing of 8.8 percent in the
Hang Seng Index in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
