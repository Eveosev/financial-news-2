Iron ore  exports from  Australia 
declined about 23 percent for the week ended Sept. 1, with 27
bulk carriers leaving  Port Hedland  and Dampier, according to
vessel tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  The combined capacity of the ships sailing from the ports
fell to 4.57 million deadweight tons, from 5.9 million
deadweight tons and 35 ships for the week ended Aug. 25, data
showed.  Australia is the world’s largest exporter of iron ore,
forecast to ship an estimated 414 million metric tons in 2011,
according to the country’s government forecaster, ABARES. Export
earnings from the steelmaking ingredient topped $56 billion for
the 12 months ended June 30, ABARES estimated.  About 68 per cent of vessels are destined for Chinese
ports. Following are the ships, destinations and arrival date
where the information is available. Drafts are expressed as a
percentage of the maximum sailing depth and are an indication of
cargo size.  To contact the reporter on this story:
