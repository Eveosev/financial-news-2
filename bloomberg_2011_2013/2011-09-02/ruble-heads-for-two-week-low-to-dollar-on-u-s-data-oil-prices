The ruble declined for a second day
against the dollar, closing at its weakest level in three weeks,
as speculation the U.S. economic recovery is faltering hurt
demand for oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner.  Russia’s currency lost 0.5 percent to 29.1350 per dollar as
of 7 p.m. in Moscow, taking its weekly loss to 0.7 percent, the
steepest since Aug. 14. The currency dropped the most in August
since May 2010.  Oil retreated in  New York  as a report showed U.S.
employment unexpectedly stagnated in August, a sign demand for
the commodity may drop in the world’s largest economy. Crude for
October delivery lost as much as 4 percent to $85.42 a barrel.  “Global factors are driving our bearishness --  oil prices 
and global growth, as well as potential shocks to risk
appetite,”  Benoit Anne , head of emerging-markets strategy at
Societe Generale SA in  London , said by e-mail. “There are
short-term risks for the ruble.”  Anne forecasts Russia’s currency will weaken as much as 2.4
percent to 35.5 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro
basket by the end of the year. The ruble fell 0.2 percent to
41.36 per euro today, leaving it down 0.3 percent at 34.6362
against the basket.  Investors increased bets that the ruble will weaken
further, with non-deliverable forwards showing it at 29.4887 per
dollar in three months, compared with 29.2765 yesterday. The
contracts provide a guide to expectations of currency movements
and interest-rate differentials and allow companies to hedge
against currency shifts.  August Declines  The ruble depreciated 4.4 percent against the dollar in
August, the biggest monthly drop since May 2010 and the worst
performance among its three peers in the so-called BRIC group of
emerging-market countries.  Brazil ’s real fell 2.5 percent
against the greenback, India’s rupee slipped 4.1 percent and
 China ’s yuan appreciated 0.9 percent.  Russia’s dollar bonds due 2020 were little changed, leaving
the yield steady at 4.18 percent. The country’s ruble Eurobond
yielded one basis point more than yesterday at 6.917 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
