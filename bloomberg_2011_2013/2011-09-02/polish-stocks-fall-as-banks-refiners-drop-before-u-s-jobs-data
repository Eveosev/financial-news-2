Poland ’s benchmark stock index fell,
poised for the steepest drop in two weeks, as banks and refiners
declined after a report showed U.S. employers added no jobs last
month.  The WIG20 Index sank 2.3 percent to 2,359.28 at 3:08 p.m.
in Warsaw, extending yesterday’s 1.5 percent drop and trimming
this week’s advance to 2 percent. Stocks in  Europe  extended
losses, crude oil slumped and the Swiss franc strengthened as a
report showed that the U.S. jobless rate held at 9.1 percent in
August as American employers became less confident in the
strength of the recovery.  Getin Holding SA (GTN) , the financial-services group controlled
by Polish billionaire Leszek Czarnecki, slumped 4.3 percent to
8.75 zloty, falling for a second day.  Bank Pekao SA (PEO) , majority
owned by UniCredit SpA, slid 4.1 percent to 141 zloty and PKO
Bank Polski SA, the country’s biggest bank, retreated 3.7
percent to 34.05 zloty.  The zloty slumped as much as 4.2 percent against the Swiss
franc, its fourth day of losses, fueling speculation lenders
will face defaults on foreign-currency mortgages. Franc-
denominated mortgages totaled 151.8 billion zloty ($52.1
billion) in June, accounting for almost 53 percent of all home
loans in Poland, according to the country’s financial regulator.  PKN Orlen SA, Poland’s biggest oil company, fell for a
second day, declining 2.2 percent to 38.44 zloty and  Grupa Lotos
SA (LTS) , the second-largest refiner, sank 4.9 percent to 28.73 zloty
as oil dropped after the U.S. data, spurring bets that fuel
consumption in the world’s largest economy will suffer.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , the copper producer with the biggest
European mine output, retreated 2.9 percent to 163.7 zloty,
heading for the lowest close in a week as the price of the metal
extended a decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
