Hire costs of capesize ships that
haul ore will rise 25 percent more as exports from  Brazil 
to  China  drive a rebound that’s doubled rents since Aug. 17,
according to Dahlman Rose & Co., a U.S. investment bank.  Daily costs for the commodity carriers climbed 9 percent to
$23,899 a day, the highest since Dec. 20, according to the
 Baltic Exchange , a London-based provider of shipping costs on 29
dry-bulk routes. Daily rents for the commodity carriers will
“soon” top $30,000 because of stronger volumes of commodities
shipped from Brazil and  Australia ,  Omar Nokta , the bank’s New
York-based shipping analyst, said by e-mail today.  “Over the short-term, firm Asian steel markets should keep
supporting capesize rates,” Nokta said in the e-mail.  Rents for capesize vessels have doubled since Aug. 17 when
Nokta forecast rents would advance to last year’s average
level of $33,000 a day within “several weeks.”  The global  steel industry  is the single most important
influence in dry-bulk shipping, with ore, coking coal and steel
products accounting for 51 percent of seaborne trade, estimated
at 3.56 billion metric tons for 2011, according to DVB Bank SE,
a German transportation lender.  The Baltic Dry Index, a broader measure of commodity
shipping costs, advanced 3.5 percent to 1,740 points, the
highest since Dec. 24.  40% of Capacity  The 1,267 capesize ships comprise 40 percent of capacity
of the dry-bulk fleet of 8,603 bulkers, according to data from
Clarkson Research Services, a unit of the world’s largest
shipbroker.  The fleet faces a glut that’s depressed the index to
average quarterly levels last seen in 2008, after too many
new vessels were ordered when rates boomed, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch said in a report Aug. 1. Demand is unlikely to
catch up with supply until 2014, it said.  Ore shipments on capesize vessels tracked by Clarkson
reached the highest monthly tally for the year in August, data
show. There were 76 vessels booked to ship ore, from 58 in July,
and 71 in June, according to Clarkson.  Rents for panamax ships, the largest to transit the Panama
Canal, rose 0.4 percent to $13,061, according the exchange. Hire
costs for supramax vessels about 25 percent smaller, were
down 0.1 percent at $14,415. Handysize ships, the smallest
tracked by the index, were 0.1 percent lower at $9,945 a day.  Some 70 percent of forecast exports of 1 billion tons of
 iron ore  in 2011 will be shipped from Brazil and Australia,
according to Clarkson. Dry-bulk vessels handle 39 percent of
world trade, according to a July presentation by Genco Shipping
& Trading Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
