RBC Capital Markets  hired Joe Dougherty as a managing director for its loan sales group as the
investment-banking arm of  Royal Bank of Canada (RY)  builds its share
of underwriting bank debt.  He reports to Sean Peters who joined RBC to lead the U.S.
loan sales team, Sanam Alaghband, a New York-based RBC
spokeswoman, said.  Dougherty joins from  Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) , where he was
selling distressed-debt.  RBC combined its new-issue and secondary loan sales team
earlier this year as it seeks to boost its 12th placed ranking
for underwriters of leveraged loans in the U.S. with 2.2 percent
market share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The firm
hired Judith Fishlow Minter in July to co-head its loan capital
markets team with Miguel Roman.  Steven Vames, a Credit Suisse spokesman, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
