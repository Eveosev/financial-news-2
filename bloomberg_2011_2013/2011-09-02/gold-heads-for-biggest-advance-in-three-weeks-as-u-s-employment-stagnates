Gold prices extended gains in  New
York  after a report showed that employment in the U.S.
unexpectedly stagnated in August, boosting demand for the
precious metal as a haven.  Futures for December delivery gained $42.30, or 2.3
percent, to $1,871.40 an ounce at 8:36 a.m. on the Comex. A
close at that price would be the biggest increase since Aug. 10.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
