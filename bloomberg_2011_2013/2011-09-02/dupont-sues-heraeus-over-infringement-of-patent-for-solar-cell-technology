DuPont Co., the largest U.S.
chemical company by market value, sued  Germany ’s Heraeus Holding
GmbH, alleging infringement of a U.S. patent for material used
in building solar cells.  Heraeus, of Hanau, Germany, owes DuPont damages for using
the technology, which includes a conductive paste of silver,
glass and resin, lawyers said in a complaint filed in federal
court in Wilmington, Delaware, today.  The infringement “will continue to cause DuPont
irreparable injury and damage” unless stopped by the court,
according to court papers. The Wilmington-based company also
seeks a  jury trial .  “DuPont invests significant resources and millions of
dollars in research,” said David B. Miller, president of DuPont
Electronics & Communications, in a statement. “We will continue
to take appropriate actions to protect our patent estate.”  “We do not have any information on this case at the
moment. No lawsuit has been officially served,” Martina Rauch,
a Heraeus spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement.  DuPont fell 76 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $47.06 at 11:40
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has
