Entreprise Generale Malta Forrest
said it filed for arbitration with  Democratic Republic  of
Congo’s Gecamines for trying to “illegally appropriate” one of
its copper and cobalt mines. Gecamines denies the charges.  Lubumbashi-based EGMF, owned by the family of mining
magnate George Forrest, said it filed charges on Aug. 24 against
state-owned Gecamines to the Paris-based  International Chamber
of Commerce ’s International Arbitration Court. EGMF said
Gecamines last month forced the sale of a 60 percent stake it
held in  Compagnie Miniere du Sud Katanga .  Gecamines, which owns the other 40 percent of CMSK, made
the purchase request, which was later backed by the Commercial
Tribunal in Lubumbashi, after it was told that Forrest wanted to
buy the same stake from the company his family owns, EGMF said.
EGMF said it never intended to sell its stake.  Gecamines Chief Executive Officer Ahmed Kalej said its
joint-venture agreement gave it the right of first refusal,
which it used when EGMF attempted to sell the stake. The sale
was “legal and binding,” he said in a phone interview from
Lubumbashi today.  EGMF said in an e-mailed statement yesterday that it had
“clearly repeated that it doesn’t want to sell its stake and
that the first refusal was groundless. Despite this, Gecamines
wants to force EGMF to sell it its stake.”  CMSK operates mines north of Lubumbashi that produce 4,000
metric tons of cobalt and 12,000 tons of copper a year,
according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
