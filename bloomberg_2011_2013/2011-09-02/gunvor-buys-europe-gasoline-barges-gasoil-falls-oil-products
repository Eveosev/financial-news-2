BP Plc bought a cargo of gasoil to
be delivered to Castellon in  Spain  at a lower price than
yesterday. Futures contracts of the heating fuel dropped as
 Brent crude  fell.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc sold naphtha to BASF SE at less than
a trade yesterday. Gasoline’s crack, or premium to Brent,
decreased. Fuel oil barges declined.  Light Products  Shell sold 12,500 metric tons of naphtha at $968 a ton for
delivery to Rotterdam from Sept. 12 to Sept. 16, according to a
survey of brokers and traders monitoring the Platts pricing
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. That compares with
a deal yesterday at $986 a ton.  Naphtha’s discount to Brent widened to $4.75 a barrel from
$4.30 yesterday, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a crude
and refined products broker in London.  Ineos Group Holdings Plc flared gases at 7:10 a.m. local
time today at its Cologne chemicals plant in  Germany  as it shut
cracker 4 for maintenance, the company said.  Eurobob gasoline for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded from $1,062 to $1,068 a ton, according
to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin
Board. That compares with yesterday’s trades from $1,054 to
$1,083 a ton. The trades are typically for 1,000 tons or 2,000
tons. Ethanol is added to Eurobob to make finished motor fuel.  Gasoline’s crack expanded to $5.71 a barrel from $5.60
yesterday, according to PVM.  Middle Distillates  BP bought as much as 30,000 tons of gasoil from Litasco,
the trading arm of OAO Lukoil, part of which was priced at a
premium of $7.50 a ton to October gasoil, the Platts survey
showed. That compares with yesterday’s trade at a $10 premium.  Heating oil barges traded three times at a discount of $3 a
ton to September gasoil, the survey showed. That compares with
deals yesterday at a discount of $3.50.  Gasoil for September dropped 1.4 percent to $953 a ton as
of 5:05 p.m. local time on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange.
The more-actively traded October contract fell 1.4 percent to
$950.50 a ton. Front month Brent declined 0.9 percent to $113.30
a barrel.  The narrowing of the backwardation between September and
October gasoil may be attributed to increased supplies,
according to JBC Energy GmbH. The spread is at $2.50 a ton, down
from $6 at the beginning of the week, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. Backwardation refers to later-dated material being
cheaper than near-term delivery.  “We have argued for quite some time that the strongly
backwardated market structure would be short-lived as supplies
increase on the back of comparatively high refinery runs and
material coming in from markets East of Suez,” JBC Energy, a
Vienna-based researcher, said today in a note.  Gasoil’s crack, a measure of refining profitability,
narrowed to $14.31 a barrel from $14.67 yesterday, according to
ICE data.  Diesel barges traded at premiums of $24 and $25 a ton to
September gasoil, according to the survey of Platts. That
compares with a deal yesterday at a $22 premium.  Residues  High-sulfur fuel oil barges traded from $635 to $639 a ton
according to the survey of Platts. That’s lower than yesterday’s
trades from $651 to $653.  The low-sulfur grade traded at $647.50 to $648.50 a ton,
the survey showed. That compares with yesterday’s trades at $662
and $665.  To contact the reporter on this story:
