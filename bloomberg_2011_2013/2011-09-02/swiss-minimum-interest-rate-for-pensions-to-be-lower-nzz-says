A Swiss expert panel proposed to
lower the minimum  interest rate  for retirement savings, Swiss
daily Neue Zuercher Zeitung reported, citing the panel.  The rate should be lowered to 1.5 percent from a current 2
percent, in reaction to the low capital market rates, the
newspaper said.  The panel proposal is based on a formula that takes into
account the average yield on  government bonds , equities and the
real estate markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
