-  Carlyle Group  and the U.K. pension
fund Universities Superannuation Scheme are backing Virgin Money
Ltd.’s bid for Northern Rock Plc, according to a person with
knowledge of the negotiations.  U.S. private-equity company JC Flowers & Co. has submitted
a rival bid for the unit of the U.K. government-owned bank,
which is worth about 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion), said the
person, who declined to be identified as the discussions are
private.  Northern Rock, the first U.K. bank nationalized during the
credit crisis, divided into two parts last year. Most of the
bank’s existing mortgages, including its “Together” loans, are
held by Northern Rock Asset Management.  Spokesmen for Virgin Money, Washington-based Carlyle and
Universities Superannuation Scheme declined to comment. A
Northern Rock spokesman wasn’t immediately available.  Sky News  reported the news earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
