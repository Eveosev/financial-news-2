Stephen Strasburg , the No. 1 pick in
Major League Baseball’s 2009 draft, threw a one-hitter over six
innings in his final rehabilitation game.  The 23-year-old Strasburg is scheduled to pitch for the
 Washington Nationals  against the  Los Angeles Dodgers  on Sept. 6,
a year after he had surgery on a torn ligament in his elbow.  Ticket prices on the secondary market for the Dodgers
series have climbed to an average of $57 from $30 in
anticipation of Strasburg’s return, according to  SeatGeek.com , a
search engine for tickets to sporting events and concerts.  Strasburg, who has been pitching for the Nationals’ farm
clubs since Aug. 7, threw 70 pitches, including 53 strikes, as
the Double-A Harrisburg Senators beat the Portland Sea Dogs 10-0
last night. The right-hander’s fastball was clocked at 99 miles
per hour (159 kph) during the game.  Strasburg, who signed a record $15 million, four-year
contract with the Nationals, had so-called Tommy John surgery to
replace a ligament on Sept. 4, 2010, two weeks after he injured
his pitching arm in a win over Philadelphia.  Strasburg set a major league record with 41 strikeouts in
his first four starts last season and went 5-3 with a 2.92
earned run average and 92 strikeouts in 68 innings.  The Nationals lost 5-2 to the  Atlanta Braves  last night. At
63-72,  Washington  is 25 games behind the National League East-
leading Phillies (87-46) in the five-team division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
