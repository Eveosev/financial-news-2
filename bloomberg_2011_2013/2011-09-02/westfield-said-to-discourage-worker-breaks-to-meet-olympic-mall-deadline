Westfield Group (WDC) , the world’s largest
owner of shopping centers, is asking contractors and employees
to work weekends and discouraging them from taking vacation as
the company tries to open its new mall in east  London  on
schedule, according to two people familiar with the project.  Work will be carried out every day until Westfield
Stratford City is completed on Sept. 13, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the matter is private. As many
as 4,500 people are working on the 1.45 billion-pound ($2.4
billion) development close to the main site for the 2012  Olympic
Games , according to Sydney-based Westfield’s  U.K. website .  “Whilst there are people who are opting to work extended
hours to deliver this iconic development, this is entirely
voluntarily,” Laura Passam, a London-based spokeswoman for
Westfield, said in an e-mailed statement.  Westfield Stratford City will be  Europe ’s largest urban
mall. The 1.9 million square feet (177,000 square meters) of
space in the shopping center will be divided into about 300
outlets, according to Westfield. The development also includes
1.1 million square feet of office space, three hotels, a 17-
screen cinema, apartments and parking for 5,000 cars.  “We have always worked towards an opening date in the
second half of 2011 and the September date was announced last
year,” Passam said.  About 25,000 construction jobs have been created during the
construction of Westfield Stratford City, the Australian
company’s website shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
