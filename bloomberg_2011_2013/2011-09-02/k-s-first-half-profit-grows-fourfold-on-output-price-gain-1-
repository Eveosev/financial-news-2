OAO TMK,  Russia ’s largest pipemaker,
reported a fourfold increase in first-half profit and said it
sees higher sales volumes in the following six months.  Net income attributable to shareholders was $256 million,
up from $69 million a year earlier and exceeding the median
estimate of $204 million in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization grew 50 percent to $625 million and sales rose 38
percent to $3.55 billion, the company said today in a statement.  “TMK confirms the previously given guidance on sales
volumes growth and does not expect a significant deterioration
of financial performance over the second half,” it said.  The company is benefiting from rising demand for steel
pipes from the oil and gas industry in Russia and the U.S. as
fuel prices increase. It is seeking to cut borrowing costs on $4
billion of debt as the company’s earnings prospects improve.  Maintenance at Russian plants and seasonally lower volumes
that may curb profit in the third quarter will be countered by
stronger operations in the following three months, TMK said.  Second-quarter net income rose to $153 million from $69
million a year earlier, TMK said in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
