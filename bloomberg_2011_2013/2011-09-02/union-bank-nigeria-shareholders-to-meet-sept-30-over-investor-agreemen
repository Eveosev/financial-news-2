Union Bank Nigeria Plc (UBN) , a lender
bailed out by the central bank in 2009, said shareholders would
meet on Sept. 30 to approve an agreement between the bank and
its core investor, African Capital Alliance Consortium.  Shareholders will discuss the number of shares to be held
by existing investors in the bank, the Lagos-based lender said
in an e-mailed statement today. They will also be asked to
approve a rights offer that would raise 10 billion naira ($65
million), according to a separate statement published in the
 Guardian newspaper .  Union Bank will ask its investors to approve cutting share
capital to 1.3 billion naira by canceling about 11 billion
shares, according to the e-mailed statement. Shareholders will
be asked to agree to a plan by the Asset Management Corp. of
 Nigeria  to put more funds in Union Bank, taking its assets to
zero, before Union Global, a member of the African Capital
Alliance, injects $500 million.  Union Bank was one of the eight lenders whose chief
executives were fired by the Central Bank of Nigeria in 2009
after a lending crisis threatened to collapse some of the
lenders in  Africa â€™s largest oil producer. The central bank
bailed out some banks with 620 billion naira and created the
 asset management company , known as Amcon, to buy non-performing
loans of the banks. This year, the eight bailed-out lenders were
given a Sept. 30 deadline to recapitalise or face liquidation or
nationalization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
