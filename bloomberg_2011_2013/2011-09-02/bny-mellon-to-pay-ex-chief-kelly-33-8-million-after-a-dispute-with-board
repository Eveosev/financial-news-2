Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) , the
world’s largest custody bank, agreed to pay $33.8 million in
severance and benefits to Robert P. Kelly, who stepped down as
chief executive officer Aug. 31 after a dispute with the board.  Kelly will receive a severance payment of $2 million, a pro
rata bonus with a target value of $4 million, restricted stock
valued at $11.2 million and a supplemental pension annuity
valued at $16.6 million, BNY Mellon said today in a regulatory
filing. The payments will result in a charge of $22 million in
the third quarter for the New York-based bank.  Kelly, 57, left over what the bank described as
“differences in approach to managing the company.” He was
replaced by Gerald L. Hassell, 59, who had been president of New
York-based  BNY Mellon  since 1998.  Kelly earned $19.4 million last year, a 38 percent increase
from 2009. Most of his compensation came in stock-based awards,
according to a March regulatory filing, and he received $1
million in salary.  He became the head of BNY Mellon in July 2007 after Bank of
New York Co. bought Pittsburgh-based rival Mellon Financial
Corp., where he had been the CEO.  BNY Mellon in July reported a 12 percent increase in
second-quarter earnings as acquisitions and market gains lifted
assets and fees from overseeing them. The bank had assets under
custody of $26.3 trillion and $1.3 trillion under management at
the end of June.  The company has declined about 34 percent this year in New
York trading, compared with a drop of 22 percent for the
Standard and Poor’s 500 Financials Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
