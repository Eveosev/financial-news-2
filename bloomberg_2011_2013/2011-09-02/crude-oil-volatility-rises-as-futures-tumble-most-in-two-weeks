Oil options volatility increased as
the underlying futures fell the most in two weeks after a
government report showed employment in the U.S. unexpectedly
stagnated in August.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
October, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 39.7 percent at 3 p.m. in  New York ,
up from 36.5 percent yesterday. Volatility was 43.2 percent a
week ago.  Oil for October delivery tumbled $2.48 or 2.8 percent, to
settle at $85.93 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
It was the biggest one-day decline since Aug. 18. Futures have
fallen 5.4 percent this year and gained 1.3 percent this week.  The most active contract in electronic trading today was
October $75 puts, with 4,991 lots changing hands as of 2:42 p.m.
The options rose 8 cents to 37 cents a barrel. October $80 puts,
the next-most active, gained 19 cents to 77 cents with 2,224
lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Puts outnumbered calls by 61 percent to 39 percent in
electronic trading on the Nymex.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occur the next business day.  October $80 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 6,410 lots changing hands. They edged
down 13 cents to 58 cents a barrel. The next-most active
options, December $110 calls, fell 6 cents to 59 cents a barrel
on volume of 5,229.  Open interest was highest for December $100 calls with
49,220 contracts. Next were December $70 puts with 46,505 and
December $120 calls with 42,488.  To contact the reporter on this story:
