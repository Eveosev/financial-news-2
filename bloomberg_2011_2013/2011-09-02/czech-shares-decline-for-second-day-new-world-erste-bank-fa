The koruna weakened the most in a
year and  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  and phone company Telefonica Czech
Republic AS led stocks lower after a U.S. report showed
employers added no jobs in August.  The Czech currency depreciated as much as 1.1 percent
against the euro, its biggest intraday retreat since July 2010,
and traded 0.9 percent down to 24.387 per euro. The PX gauge of
14 companies slipped 1.5 percent to 1,023.8 at its 4:28 p.m.
close in  Prague , paring this week’s gain to 0.9 percent with the
biggest one-day drop since Aug. 19.  Global stocks slumped and most emerging-market currencies
weakened as reports showing payrolls in the world’s largest
economy stagnated and the jobless rate held at 9.1 percent added
to signs the global recovery is slowing. Austria’s Erste and
Telefonica Czech, with a combined 37 percent weighting in the
index, each fell more than 2.8 percent.  The “employment report shows no hiring, an indication
recession is at hand,”  Julia Coronado , chief economist for the
Americas at BNP Paribas SA in  New York , wrote in a report today.  The Czech currency has retreated 1.3 percent in the past
five days versus the euro, heading for its biggest weekly
depreciation since December 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
