Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,  Brazil ’s
state-controlled oil producer, fell the most in more than two
weeks on concern the government may increase taxes to benefit
states that don’t produce any oil.  Petrobras fell 91 centavos, or 4.3 percent, to 20.13 reais
in Sao Paulo trading at 1:49 p.m. New York time. Earlier, it
lost as much as 4.5 percent, the largest drop since Aug. 18.
Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa stock index fell 2.6 percent.  Brazil’s government is studying increasing a special
participation tax on oil production that may raise revenue by 3
billion reais ($1.85 billion), Valor Economico newspaper
reported today, without saying where it got the information.  “This is a debate that is very negative for Petrobras and
other oil producers,” Monica Araujo, the head of research at
Ativa Corretora, said in a telephone interview from  Rio de
Janeiro . “Non-producing states want a more fair distribution.”  An official at the Energy Ministry’s press office, who
declined to be named because of internal policy, said in a
telephone interview that the ministry is studying a proposal
from Rio de Janeiro Governor Sergio Cabral to increase the tax.
The ministry hasn’t made a decision on the proposal, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
