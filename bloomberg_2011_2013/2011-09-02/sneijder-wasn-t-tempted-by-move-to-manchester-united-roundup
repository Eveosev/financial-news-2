The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable links to the Web.  Sneijder Settled  Inter Milan midfielder  Wesley Sneijder  said he rejected a
move to Manchester United because he feels comfortable in Italy,
the  Daily Mirror  reported.  Sneijder said his wage demands weren’t the reason the
transfer didn’t go ahead, according to the Mirror, adding he
commands 250,000 pounds per week ($405,000 per week).  McClaren May Go  Former England coach  Steve McClaren  may quit Nottingham
Forest after three months because he’s unhappy with what he sees
as a lack of investment on players, the  Daily Mirror  reported.  Forest has released nine players during the offseason, when
it spent as little as 2 million pounds on recruiting new squad
members, the Mirror said.  Hargreaves Sidelined  Owen Hargreaves  has been left out of Manchester City’s
Champions League squad, two days after his move from  Manchester
United , the  Daily Mail  reported.  City coach  Roberto Mancini  believes the midfielder needs
five or six weeks of fitness work before he’s ready to play,
according to the Mail.  Bendtner Vow  Nicklas Bendtner says he won’t return to Arsenal after
being loaned to Sunderland on transfer deadline day,  the Sun 
reported.  Bendtner said he’s upset he didn’t get the chance to prove
himself after recovering from injuries sustained in a car crash
two years ago, according to the Sun.  To contact the reporters on this story:
