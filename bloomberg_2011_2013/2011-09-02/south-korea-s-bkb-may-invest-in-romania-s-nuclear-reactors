BKB Co. Ltd., a South-Korean
company, is interested in investing in  Romania ’s planned two new
nuclear reactors, the  Economy Ministry  said.  BKB sent a letter of intent to Minister Ion Ariton
expressing its “firm interest” in acquiring a stake in
EnergoNuclear SA, the project-company created to handle the
construction of the third and fourth nuclear reactors at
Romania’s Cernavoda plant, according to the ministry’s e-mailed
statement today.  Romania said recently it wants to continue its nuclear
power expansion after leaking radiation at the Fukushima nuclear
plant in  Japan  following a devastating earthquake and tsunami on
March 11 prompted governments such as  Germany  to rethink their
nuclear expansion programs.  A group led by BKB plans to visit Romania “to hold
technical discussions with our specialists in order to
materialize their intentions,” the Bucharest-based ministry
said in the statement.  The government is currently seeking investors for the two
nuclear reactors estimated at 4 billion euros ($5.7 billion),
after CEZ AS,  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA, RWE AG and Iberdrola SA pulled out in
January, citing unclear regulations and doubts about future
power demand. Italy’s Enel SpA and steelmaker ArcelorMittal are
still part of the project.  The east European country plans to lower its majority stake
in the project to 40 percent as it seeks to split the financing
costs with investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
