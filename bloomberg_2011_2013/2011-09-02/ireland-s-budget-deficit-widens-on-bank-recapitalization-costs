Ireland’s budget deficit widened in
eight months through August compared with the same period a year
earlier on payments to recapitalize the country’s banks.  The deficit widened to 20.4 billion euros ($29 billion) so
far this year compared with a shortfall of 12.1 billion euros a
year earlier, the  Finance Ministry  in Dublin said in a statement
today. Excluding bank injections, the deficit fell by about 2
billion euros.  Ireland’s government is pouring about 17 billion euros in
the country’s banks this year, in an effort to draw a line under
the nation’s financial crisis. The European Union said today
Ireland’s financial assistance program is on track, with the
state seeking to close the deficit to 3 percent in 2015 from an
underlying 10 percent this year.  The increase in the deficit to August was due to 3.1
billion euros in payments in the first half of the year relating
to the bailouts of Anglo Irish Bank Corp., Irish Nationwide
Building Society and EBS Ltd. and about 7.5 billion euros in
one-off payments relating to bank recapitalizations in July
after stress tests in March against loan losses.  Sales-tax receipts were 3.3 percent below government
forecasts in the first eight months of the year, while income
tax beat the forecast by 1.6 percent, the ministry said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
