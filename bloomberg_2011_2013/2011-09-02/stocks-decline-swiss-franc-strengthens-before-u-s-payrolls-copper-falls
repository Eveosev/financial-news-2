Stocks in  Europe  and  Asia  declined,
U.S. futures fell and the Swiss franc strengthened before an
American jobs report that may show unemployment exceeded 9
percent. Copper slid for a second day and grains rose.  The MSCI All-Country World Index lost 0.8 percent as of
9:42 a.m. in London. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 1.9 percent

percent. The Swiss franc gained against all 16 of its major
counterparts. Copper and nickel declined more than 0.6 percent,
and corn rose 1.2 percent. Ten-year Treasury note yields were
little changed at 2.13 percent.  The benchmark for global equities fell for a second day,
paring gains from the biggest weekly advance in two months. Data
today from the U.S. Labor Department may show that employers
added fewer workers in August and economists’ estimates indicate
 Germany  will report next week factory orders fell for the first
time in four months. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Societe
Generale SA cut U.S. jobs forecasts yesterday.  “The U.S. recovery remains anemic, with lingering concerns
over  job creation  and house prices,” said  Tim Schroeders , who
helps manage $1 billion in equities at Pengana Capital Ltd. in
 Melbourne . “Expectations are relatively low for tonight’s jobs
data.”  The  S&P 500  slumped 1.2 percent yesterday. The U.S. equity
benchmark is up 2.4 percent in the past four trading days.  ‘Out of Favor’  UBS AG reduced its year-end estimate for the MSCI Asia

remain “broadly out of favor” amid slowing economic growth.
The stock gauge slipped 0.9 percent to 510.81.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, which includes Japan, lost 1.1
percent, falling for the first time in seven days. The gauge is

declined and the  New York  Times reported that the U.S. may sue
banks for misrepresenting the quality of securities backed by
home loans, citing three people briefed on the matter. The franc
advanced 1.2 percent to 1.1207 per euro. The yen rose 0.1
percent to 76.83 per dollar.  “The possibility that banks may be sued over mortgages
appears to be fueling risk aversion,” said Lee Wai Tuck, a
currency strategist at Forecast Pte in  Singapore . “This, in
turn, is causing haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and
the yen to be bought.”  The euro was set for the biggest weekly drop against the
dollar in almost two months. The 17-nation currency slid versus
most of its 16 major counterparts in the past five days before
the  European Central Bank  holds a policy meeting on Sept. 8. It

to $7.675 a bushel.  Oil futures headed for a second weekly gain as a tropical
