China ’s yuan fell for a second day
on concern that the global recovery is faltering, damping the
outlook for exports from the world’s second-largest economy.  Growth in U.S. payrolls slowed in August, according to the
median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey before a
Labor Department report today. The People’s Bank of China set
the currency’s reference rate 0.06 percent weaker at 6.3896 per
dollar. The yuan has advanced 1.2 percent this quarter on
optimism policy makers will tolerate appreciation to curb
inflation that is running at the fastest pace in three years.  “Investor confidence remains weak as the global economic
outlook isn’t that bright,” said Kenix Lai, a senior market
analyst at Bank of East Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. “The yuan’s
weakness is being partly offset by concern about inflation in
China.”  The yuan slipped 0.02 percent to close at 6.3826 per dollar
in  Shanghai  today, paring this week’s gain to 0.07 percent,
according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. The
currency touched 6.3705 on Aug. 30, the strongest level since
the country unified the official and market exchange rates at
the end of 1993.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan was unchanged
today at 6.3545 per dollar. It advanced 0.3 percent this week.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.07 percent to
6.2813, limiting the weekly increase to 0.2 percent. The
contracts were at a 1.6 percent premium to the onshore spot
rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Inflation in the nation is unlikely to have peaked in
August, the China Securities Journal wrote in a front-page
editorial today. Consumer prices rose 6.5 percent from a year
earlier in July, the most in three years, official data showed
last month.  Payrolls in the U.S. expanded by 68,000 after a 117,000
increase in July, according to the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
