U.S. stocks slumped, wiping out the
weekly gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as a government
report showing employment stagnated last month stoked concern
the world’s largest economy may fall into a recession.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) ,  Ford Motor Co. (F)  and  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  slid at
least 3.5 percent, pacing losses among companies most-tied to
economic growth. Financial stocks in the S&P 500 slumped 4
percent, the most within 10 groups, as the Federal Housing
Finance Agency sued lenders over residential mortgage-backed
securities.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  tumbled at
least 5.3 percent.  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  fell 2.1 percent as oil sank.  The S&P 500 declined 2.5 percent to 1,173.97 at 4 p.m. in
New York, dropping 0.2 percent this week. All 10 of its main
industries slid. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  retreated
253.31 points, or 2.2 percent, to 11,240.26 today. The U.S.
stock market will be closed Sept. 5 for a holiday.  “The jobs report was just ugly,” Michael Mullaney, who
helps manage $9.5 billion at Fiduciary Trust in Boston, said in
a telephone interview. “We’ve been watching deceleration of
economic activity on a global basis. Does that increase the odds
of a recession? It’s a coin toss at this point, 50-50. This will
probably push the  Federal Reserve  over the edge.”  The  S&P 500  slid as much as 18 percent from a three-year
high on April 29 amid concern the economy was weakening. The
index fell 5.7 percent in August, for the biggest monthly drop
since May 2010. Stocks trimmed losses at the end of last month
as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in an Aug. 26
speech in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming, that the central bank has tools
to stimulate growth without signaling he will use them.  Jobs Data  Employment in the U.S. stagnated in August and the jobless
rate held at 9.1 percent as American employers became less
confident in the strength of the recovery.  Payrolls were unchanged last month, the weakest reading
since September 2010, after an 85,000 gain in July that was less
than initially estimated, Labor Department data showed. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for a rise of
65,000. Hourly earnings and hours worked both declined. The
August data included a 48,000 drop in information industry jobs,
mostly reflecting striking Verizon Communications Inc. workers.  “Another disappointing report that speaks to a severe
unemployment crisis that, unfortunately, is becoming even more
stubbornly embedded,”  Mohamed A. El-Erian , the chief executive
officer at Pacific Investment Management Co. in  Newport Beach ,
 California , wrote in an e-mail. Pimco is the world’s largest
bond-fund manager. “Along with  Europe ’s dislocations, this
fuels concerns about the global economic outlook and the growing
risk of a recession.”  Most-Tied  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to
the economy slumped 3.5 percent. The Dow Jones Transportation
Average, which is also considered a proxy for economic growth,
decreased 3.4 percent. Caterpillar, the world’s largest
construction and mining-equipment maker, slid 3.6 percent to
$85.38. Ford dropped 4 percent to $10.42. FedEx tumbled 4
percent to $74.90.  The KBW Bank Index fell 4.5 percent as all of its 24 stocks
declined. Bank of America tumbled 8.3 percent to $7.25.
Citigroup dropped 5.3 percent to $28.40.  “If in fact all that cash gets taken away in these
lawsuits, you are crashing the American banking system,”
Richard Bove, an analyst with Rochdale Securities LLC in Lutz,
Florida, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“InBusiness with Margaret Brennan” today. “If you make the
assumption that over the next few years, all of these suits are
going to be put in place and they’re all going to be won, you’re
going to wipe out the American banking industry and you’re going
to wipe out the American economy.”  Commodity Producers  Gauges of energy and raw-material producers in the S&P 500
sank at least 2.4 percent as the S&P GSCI Index of 24
commodities lost 1.3 percent. Chevron dropped 2.1 percent to
$96.41, while  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  slid 3.6 percent to $12.04. Newmont
Mining Corp., the largest U.S. gold producer, added 3.2 percent
to $64.47 after gold jumped amid demand for haven assets.  H&R Block Inc. (HRB)  lost 12 percent to $13.41. The largest U.S.
tax preparer reported first-quarter revenue was $267.6 million,
missing the average analyst estimate of $276.2 million.  Bearish bets against the S&P 500 rose to a nine-month high
as short sellers increased speculation stocks may decline amid
concerns over the strength of global economic growth.  The proportion of S&P 500 shares outstanding sold short on
Aug. 29 rose to 3.03 percent, the most since the end of November
and up from 2.37 percent at the beginning of August, according
to New York-based Data Explorers, which provides research on
short sales and  stock lending .  Three-Year High  Short selling of the gauge reached a three-year high of
5.52 percent in August 2008, before the worst financial crisis
since the 1930s drove the stock index to a 12-year low in March
2009.  Short selling increased in August after S&P downgraded the
U.S. government’s credit rating and yields on Greek debt surged
to record highs. Investors made bearish wagers on equities and
shifted holdings to havens such as Treasuries, which posted the
highest returns since December 2008.  “We’ve had inadequate policy responses to the problem of
too much debt, and that makes people concerned,” Mark Travis,
chief executive officer of Jacksonville Beach, Florida-based
Intrepid Capital Management Inc., said in a telephone interview.
“Investors and advisers are doing more now on the short side to
protect their capital and they’re trying to find alternatives to
flat market returns,” said Travis, who manages $1.3 billion and
uses short selling as an investment strategy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
