Corn rallied after declining the
most in two months yesterday, as forecasts of lower yields in
the U.S., the world’s largest grower, prompted purchases amid
expectations of further price increases.  December-delivery corn gained 1.1 percent to $7.4625 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 11:21 a.m. in  London ,
paring this week’s drop to 2.6 percent. Futures climbed 15
percent last month.  Production of corn, the nation’s largest crop, will total
12.35 billion bushels, down from last month’s estimate of 13.002
billion, INTL FCStone Inc. said yesterday. FCStone joined Morgan
Stanley and the Professional Farmers of America in lowering
yield and production estimates on unfavorable weather in the
U.S.  “You’re probably seeing some people still coming in and
thinking corn’s still not a bad buy at these levels, given the
risks are that we’re seeing some pretty negative estimates on
U.S. corn yields,” said Paul Deane, an economist at Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “Even though it’s pushed lower,
it’s probably justified at these levels.”  About 12.484 billion bushels of corn will be harvested,
less than the 12.914 billion forecast by the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  on Aug. 11, Pro Farmer said on Aug. 26. Morgan
Stanley said Aug. 29 that corn yields may average 149.5 bushels
an acre, compared with the USDA’s estimate of 153 bushels.  “There’s still upside in corn if we see those yield
estimates,” Deane said by phone from  Melbourne . Prices may rise
“significantly above $8 in a month or so” if lower yield
estimates come through, he said.  Extending Gains  Corn and soybeans may extend gains, outperforming other
agricultural commodities, as worsening weather in the U.S. may
hurt crop yields and tighten supplies, according to Mirae Asset
MAPS Global Investments.  Increasing feed-grain demand led by  China  and low
inventories should also push up corn and soybean prices,
according to Kwon Jung Hoon, manager of  South Korea ’s biggest
agriculture-commodity fund, which is run by Mirae Asset MAPS.  Corn, used in food, livestock feed and biofuels, is the
second-best performing commodity in the past year on the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Commodity index.  Corn dropped 3.8 percent yesterday, the biggest decline
since July 1, after the USDA said overseas sales decreased.
Exporters last week sold 957,934 metric tons of corn for
delivery after Sept. 1, down 43 percent from a year earlier, the
department said. Total sales for the new season are 8.7 percent
smaller than a year earlier.  Soybeans for November delivery gained 0.5 percent to
$14.4175 a bushel, set to extend their weekly advance to 1.3
percent. Wheat for December delivery rose 1 percent to $7.69 a
bushel, heading for a weekly decline of 3.5 percent after
falling the most in three weeks yesterday. Milling wheat for
November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris slipped 0.5
percent to 207.75 euros ($296.06) a ton.  The European Union’s weekly wheat export licenses fell to
276,000 tons in the week to Aug. 30 from 326,000 tons a week
earlier, according to the European Commission.  To contact the reporter for this story:
