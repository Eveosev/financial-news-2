South Africa ’s stock index fell the
most in two weeks after U.S. employment unexpectedly stagnated
in August, raising concern that the global economic recovery is
faltering.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share gauge declined 1.8 percent to
30,518.92 by 5 p.m. in Johannesburg, paring the week’s advance
to 3.7 percent.  Payrolls were unchanged last month, the weakest reading
since September 2010, after an 85,000 gain in July that was less
than initially estimated, Labor Department data showed today in
 Washington . The lack of hiring is one reason Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  last week said the central bank still
has tools available to stimulate growth.  “The clawback today has to be seen in the context of the
very strong markets we have seen this week,” Simon Hudson-
Peacock, a portfolio manager at Cadiz Asset Management, said by
telephone from  Cape Town . “Bernanke’s speech kick-started the
recovery and these numbers have just put a dampner on that and
there is a retracement from the positive mood earlier in the
week.”  Emerging-market stocks fell for the first time in six days,
with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index paring this week’s rally to
4.9 percent, the biggest since October 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
