The  National Transportation Safety
Board  is urging regulators to require rollover-prevention
technology on fuel-tanker trucks, following its probe of a fiery
2009 crash in Indianapolis.  The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the
Transportation Departmentâ€™s trucking regulator, should mandate
anti-rollover retrofits for cargo tank trailers that weigh more
than 10,000 pounds, the NTSB said in recommendations sent to the
agency today.  Tankers carrying hazardous materials may be top-heavy and
vulnerable to minor steering errors, the board said in  its
accident report .  Quality Distribution Inc. (QLTY)  and closely held
Groendyke Transport are among the companies that would be
affected by a retrofit.  The safety board, which cannot implement changes, completed
its investigation of the Indianapolis crash in July, concluding
that a rollover that released 9,001 gallons of liquefied
petroleum gas could have been prevented with stability control.  Without regulation, the trucking industry has had little
incentive to pay for the technology, the safety board said.
Because of the long working life of tankers, it may take 50
years for stability control technology to be used throughout
fleets without mandated retrofits, it said.  The October 22, 2009, Indianapolis crash displaced a pier
holding a bridge on Interstate 465, closing an interchange for
several days. The trucker and another driver sustained serious
injuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
