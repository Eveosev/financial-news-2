than a month after car sales unexpectedly fell in  China  and
 Alcoa Inc. (AA)  cut its demand forecast, dimming the outlook for
metals consumption. Copper was little changed.  Aluminum for delivery in three months slid as much as 0.8
percent to $1,993 a metric ton on the  London  Metal Exchange, the
lowest price since Sept. 7. The metal yesterday tumbled 2.2
percent, the most since July 20, as Alcoa, the largest U.S.

a slowdown in China. Copper on the LME dropped as much as 0.7
percent to $8,105 a ton, the lowest since Sept. 26.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold rose for the first time in five days, snapping the
worst losing run in more than two months, on speculation
 Europe ’s debt crisis will boost demand for a protection of
wealth.  Standard & Poor’s cut Spain’s debt rating yesterday to one
grade above junk on mounting economic and political risks in the
region. The U.S. Dollar Index, a gauge against six counterparts,
rose today to the highest level since Sept. 11. Investment

0.4 percent to $1,771.40 an ounce on the Comex in New York.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans advanced, snapping a three-day decline, as a
government report may show that drought damage to crops in the
U.S. is eroding the nation’s supplies to levels below year-
earlier demand for the first time since 1974.  Soybeans for November delivery rose as much as 1.5 percent
to $15.465 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and were at
$15.4025 at 2:25 p.m. in Singapore. Futures are up 28 percent
this year after a U.S. drought cut yields. The U.S. is set to be
the biggest soybean producer after  Brazil  in 2012-2013.  Corn for delivery in December was little changed at $7.3725
a bushel, while wheat for December delivery slipped 0.4 percent
to $8.66 a bushel.  Palm oil advanced for a third day on speculation that its
deepening discount to soybean oil will attract buyers and that
Indonesia and  Malaysia , the biggest producers, will take steps
to support prices.  The contract for December delivery climbed as much as 2.1
percent to 2,508 ringgit ($818) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, and was at 2,495 ringgit at 3:51 p.m. in
Kuala Lumpur. Futures fell on Oct. 2 to the lowest close since
November 2009 as stockpiles climbed and demand eased.  Rubber declined for a second day to the lowest level in
more than one week after Standard & Poor’s cut Spain’s debt
rating, raising concerns over the health of global economy and
demand for the commodity used to make tires.  To contact the reporter on this story:
