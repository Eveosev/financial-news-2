The  Oakland Athletics  rallied for
three runs in the bottom of the ninth inning to defeat the
Detroit Tigers 4-3 and force their American League Division
Series to a decisive fifth game tonight.  The best-of-five Major League Baseball playoff series is
tied 2-2. The fifth game will be in Oakland.  Seth Smith had a two-run double to tie the game and Coco
Crisp won it with a run-scoring single. All the runs came off
Detroit reliever Jose Valverde.  The winner of the series will play either the New York
Yankees or the Baltimore Orioles for a spot in the World Series.  The Yankees defeated the Orioles 3-2 in 12 innings last
night in  New York  to take a 2-1 lead in that series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
