Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s
biggest maker of  wind turbines , fired about 18 percent of its
 Colorado  manufacturing workers at two blade factories this week.  The company didn’t say how many people were affected at the
plants in Brighton and Windsor, in a statement today. Total
manufacturing employment at four Vestas Colorado factories this
year fell to 1,200 people from more than 1,700, including losses
from attrition.  The company has a “significant reduction” in turbine
orders for next year, in part because of a U.S. tax credit
that’s due to expire at the end of this year, Aarhus, Denmark-
based Vestas said in the statement. Electricity produced from
wind, biomass, geothermal and landfill-gas plants currently
receives a credit of 2.2 cents per kilowatt-hour under the
federal Production Tax Credit.  Vestas fired 75 workers earlier this week at its Brighton
plant, after cutting about 30 workers at the same plant on Aug.
21. About 90 workers were affected at a plant in Pueblo,
Colorado, Aug. 13, as the company seeks to cuts its global
workforce about 16 percent this year to 19,000 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
