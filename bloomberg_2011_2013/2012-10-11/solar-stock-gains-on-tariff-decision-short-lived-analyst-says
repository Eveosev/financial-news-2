Solar-stock gains after the U.S.
Commerce Department revised its duties on Chinese imports may be
“short lived” because investors are ignoring looming trade
issues in other countries, an analyst said.  The  Bloomberg Global Large Solar Index (BISOLAR)  of 17 companies that
make solar panels and materials, increased 0.9 percent, the most
in a week.  JinkoSolar Holding Co. (JKS) , a Chinese panel company rose
8.6 percent at the close in  New York , its biggest increase since
Oct. 4.  Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ)  gained 3.4 percent and  First Solar
Inc. (FSLR)  increased 3.2 percent.  The U.S. issued anti-dumping duties of as much as 250
percent on solar products imported from  China  yesterday, after
ruling in May that they sell products below cost.  The stock gains fail to consider a similar trade dispute in
Europe that may also result in tariffs on Chinese imports and
the potential for retaliatory action in China,  Mark Bachman , an
analyst at Avian Securities Inc. in Boston, said in an e-mail
today.  “Both of these could have negative implications to the
supply chain, and could increase manufacturing costs,” Bachman
said.  “The duty structure has been set and remains punitive,”
he said. “It could have been worse, but the situation certainly
did not improve.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
