Softbank Corp. (9984) ,  Japan ’s third-
largest mobile phone company, is in talks to buy control of
 Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  for more than 1.5 trillion yen ($19 billion),
the Nikkei newspaper reported on its website.  Softbank is seeking to buy  two-thirds  of Sprint Nextel’s
shares, the Nikkei reported, without saying where it got the
information. The Nikkei earlier reported the deal would be worth
as much as 2 trillion yen.  Softbank is “checking the facts of the Nikkei report,”
Mariko Osada, a spokeswoman for the Tokyo-based company said by
phone.  The deal would give Softbank a base for entering the U.S.
market with a compatible carrier that uses similar equipment
made by  Sweden ’s Ericsson AB, the Nikkei reported. Softbank, the
fastest-growing Japanese mobile phone provider, on Oct. 2 agreed
to pay 180 billion yen for smaller local rival eAccess Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
