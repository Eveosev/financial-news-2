Several thousand people marched in
 Mali ’s capital, Bamako, in support of military action against
Islamist rebel groups that have seized the north of the country.  Protesters carried placards urging the Malian army to “go
to the frontline,” while others called on the Economic
Community of West African States, a regional body, to send
soldiers.  “We have to save our country from the tragic situation
it’s in,” Ibrahima N’Diaye, a spokesman for Front for the
Republic and Democracy, a civil society group, told reporters in
the capital today.  Malian leaders last month asked Ecowas for troops to help
take back control of the north, which has been occupied by at
least three different groups of Islamist fighters, including a
group linked to al-Qaeda, since May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
