The European Parliament’s Economic
and Monetary Affairs Committee will issue a negative opinion on
the nomination of Luxembourg’s Yves Mersch to the European
Central Bank’s Executive Board, lawmaker Sylvie Goulard said.  “A negative recommendation would be adopted based on the
failure by the Council to respect the demands laid down by the
EP well ahead of the procedure, in a spirit of sincere
cooperation and aiming at respecting a wider diversity of
origins (notably the gender balance),” Goulard said in an e-
mailed statement today. “No judgment would be made on the
competences of the candidate.”  Mersch’s nomination was put in limbo last month when the
committee objected to the lack of female candidates for the post
and postponed a planned hearing. The ECB seat has been empty
since June 1. Mersch, the euro region’s longest serving central
banker, was selected by European finance ministers in July. The
committee will hold a hearing on Mersch’s candidacy on Oct. 22.  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said Oct. 5
that the parliament doesn’t have the legal authority to stop
Mersch’s candidacy. Euro-region leaders will give the final nod.  To contact the reporter on this story:
