The zloty retreated to the lowest
level in a week on concern Polish policy makers may seek weaker
currency to spur exports as economic growth slows.  The currency lost 0.2 percent to 4.1006 per euro as of
12:20 p.m. in Warsaw, depreciating for a third day. The yield on
five-year notes fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 4.12 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The zloty exchange rate of between 4 and 4.5 per euro is
“safe” and gives a “good foundation” for Polish economy,
Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in Helsinki yesterday. There was
no “economic sense” in trying to encourage appreciation,
Deputy Finance Minister Wojciech Kowalczyk told Dziennik Gazeta
Prawna in an interview published today.  “We expect to hear more rhetoric to weaken the zloty,”
 Rafal Benecki , chief economist for  Poland  at ING Groep NV in
Warsaw, wrote in an e-mailed note today. “With more evidence of
worsening economic activity the intensity of verbal
interventions will grow.”  The  International Monetary Fund  this week cut Polish
economic growth forecast to the slowest pace since 2009.
Expansion will slow to 2.4 percent this year and 2.1 percent in
2013, bucking the trend for emerging European economies that are
set to expand at faster pace next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
