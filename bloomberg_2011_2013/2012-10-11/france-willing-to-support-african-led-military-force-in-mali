France would be willing to support
an African-led military force to expel Islamic militants from
 Mali , President  Francois Hollande  said in an interview with
three media organizations today.  “France won’t intervene and there won’t be French troops
on the ground, but we are willing to help an African-led force
materially,” he said in an interview with television channels
France 24 and TV5 Monde and Radio France Internationale on the
eve of an African tour.  France, which this month said it will circulate at the
 United Nations Security Council  a draft resolution for such a
force, wants the “Africans to decide” on any intervention,
Hollande said. He said France wants a UN resolution to enable
such a force to act.  His trip to Africa is in part aimed at ensuring French
companies, including oil producer  Total SA (FP) , play a greater role
on the continent, he said.  “Our economic interests there need to be protected,” he
said, adding that there needs to be “greater transparency in
all extractive industries in Africa.”  Separately, Hollande reiterated that it’s imperative that
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad step down.  “The sooner Bashar leaves, the smoother the transition
will be,” he said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
