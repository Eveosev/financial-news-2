The  National Basketball Association 
plans to build a facility near Beijing that will feature indoor
courts, shopping and dining as it seeks to bolster the sport’s
popularity in the world’s second-biggest economy.  The 12,000 square meter “NBA Center” will be constructed
with Chinese developer Yatai Lanhai Investment Group between
Beijing and the neighboring port city of Tianjin, according to a
statement. It will include an NBA-themed restaurant, an
interactive games area and a store selling team apparel.  Rising incomes in China have made it the world’s biggest
market for products ranging from cars to personal computers. In
addition to NBA apparel and the licensing of games, China’s
domestic basketball league has also become a destination for
former NBA players including Stephon Marbury and Tracy McGrady.  The NBA Center will be a free-standing facility located
within Yatai Lanhai’s 2,300-acre development named New Water
Town, which is designed to accommodate 150,000 residents,
according to the statement. The facility is expected to begin
operations in 2015, the NBA said.  The league, which set up its China unit in 2008, currently
employs more than 100 people in Beijing, Shanghai,  Hong Kong  and
Taipei, according to the NBA. Pre-season games between the  Miami
Heat  and the  Los Angeles Clippers  are being held in Beijing and
Shanghai this week. After those matches, the NBA will have held
13 games in China since 2004.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
