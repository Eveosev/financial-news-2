Oil advanced after the fewest number
of Americans in four years filed first-time applications for
 unemployment benefits  and on concern that tension between Syria
and  Turkey  will disrupt shipments from the  Middle East .  Futures rose 0.9 percent as the Labor Department reported
that claims for  jobless benefits  fell to 339,000 last week, the
lowest level since February 2008. Turkey seized cargo on a
Syrian passenger plane forced to land yesterday. Price gains
eased after the government said that U.S.  supplies climbed  last
week as output rose to a 17-year high.  “The jobless numbers gave the market another push
higher,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The forced landing
of the Syrian plane by Turkey opens a new front in the tensions
between the countries, which is supportive for the market.”  Crude oil for November delivery rose 82 cents to settle at
$92.07 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are
up 7.3 percent from a year earlier.  Brent oil for November settlement increased $1.38, or 1.2
percent, to end the session at $115.71 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European benchmark grade
reached a $23.64-a-barrel premium to West Texas Intermediate oil
traded in  New York , the highest level since Oct. 20, 2011.  Employment Picture  Applications for benefits dropped 30,000 in the week ended
Oct. 6, the  Labor Department  said. Economists forecast 370,000
claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.
One state accounted for most of the plunge in claims, a
department spokesman said as the data were issued to the press.
The breakdown by state will show up in next week’s report.  The U.S. consumed 18.8 million barrels a day of oil in
2011, or 21 percent of the world’s total, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s
Statistical Review of World Energy.  Turkish F-16 jets forced the airplane traveling from Moscow
to Damascus to land after intelligence reports said it was
carrying cargo banned by civil-aviation rules, Foreign Minister
 Ahmet Davutoglu  said yesterday.  “It’s fear about what’s going on in the Middle East that’s
keeping prices here,” said Todd Horwitz, chief strategist at
Adam Mesh Trading Group in  Chicago . “Anytime tension eases, the
oil market gets whacked.”  There have been six days of artillery exchanges across the
border between Turkey and Syria triggered by the deaths of five
Turkish civilians when a mortar shell landed in a frontier
village on Oct. 3.  Ceyhan Pipeline  About 1.2 million barrels of crude a day is shipped from
the Turkish port of Ceyhan, according to consultants Petromatrix
GmbH in Zug,  Switzerland . Ceyhan is the export location for most
of the oil pumped in northern  Iraq , the second-largest producer
in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and for
supplies from  Azerbaijan .  The Kirkuk-Ceyhan line runs through Iraq and southern
Turkey near the Syrian border.  “Oil traders don’t care much about Syria,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New
York. “What they do care about is the pipeline that runs from
northern Iraq to Ceyhan. If that pipeline is in harm’s way,
traders will be paying attention.”  The Middle East pumped 27.7 million barrels of oil a day
last year, about 33 percent of world output, according to BP.  U.S. Stockpiles  Crude supplies rose 1.67 million barrels to 366.4 million
barrels last week, the Energy Department said. The gain left
stockpiles 8.5 percent higher than a year earlier. Inventories
were forecast to increase 1.5 million barrels, according to the
median of 11 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  “The market is fundamentally oversupplied,” Horwitz said.  Output of crude rose 78,000 barrels a day to 6.6 million in
the week ended Oct. 5, the most since May 1995, the report
showed. Imports increased 115,000 barrels a day to 8.22 million.  Gasoline inventories  fell 534,000 barrels to 195.4 million
last week, the lowest level since October 2008, the department
said. Stockpiles of  distillate fuel , a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, tumbled 3.18 million barrels to 120.9
million. Supplies dropped 6 percent over the last four weeks.  “We have a big drop in distillates and you are seeing
distillates lead the market higher,” said  Kyle Cooper , director
of commodities research at IAF Advisors in Houston.  Heating oil for November delivery rose 4.4 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $3.2571 a gallon in New York, the highest settlement
since March 19.  The department published its report a day later than usual
this week because of the Oct. 8 Columbus Day holiday.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 569,739
contracts as of 3:48 p.m. Volume totaled 681,415 contracts
yesterday, 30 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.56 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
