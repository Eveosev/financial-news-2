PPC Ltd. (PPC) ,  South Africa ’s biggest
cement maker, named Ketso Gordhan as chief executive officer to
replace Paul Stuiver.  Gordhan, who worked in President  Jacob Zuma ’s office, takes
over on Jan. 1, the Johannesburg-based company said in a
statement today. Gordhan was the head of private equity at
FirstRand Financial Services Group, PPC said.  PPC is focusing on expanding outside of South Africa to
boost profit as economic growth in the continent’s biggest
economy is set to decelerate to the slowest pace this year since
the 2009 recession, according to the central bank. The
Industrial Development Corp. and PPC agreed to buy about half of
Ethiopia’s Habesha Cement Share Co. in July.  The shares fell 1.1 percent to 27.73 rand at 3:35 p.m. in
Johannesburg, paring their gain this year to 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
