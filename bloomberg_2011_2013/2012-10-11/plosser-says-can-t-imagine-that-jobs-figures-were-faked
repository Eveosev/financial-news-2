Charles Plosser , president of the
 Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia , said he “can’t imagine”
that the September unemployment report was manipulated for
political gain by the Obama administration.  “I can’t imagine that’s the case,” Plosser told reporters
after a speech today in Avondale, Pennsylvania. “The
statisticians and the people that work on this stuff have a lot
of integrity.”  Plosser commented on suggestions by  Jack Welch , the former
chief executive officer of General Electric Co., that an Oct. 5
report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing an unexpected
decline in the jobless rate had been altered.  The report showed the jobless rate fell in September to 7.8
percent, the lowest level since President  Barack Obama  took
office in January 2009, from 8.1 percent in August. The rate was
forecast to rise to 8.2 percent, according to the median
estimate.  Welch, 76, in a Twitter message immediately after the
report, suggested the numbers were phony. “Unbelievable jobs
numbers. . . these Chicago guys will do anything. . . can’t
debate so change numbers,” he wrote. Obama administration
officials denounced Welch’s claims as baseless.  Welch revisited his criticism later in a column in the Wall
Street Journal.  “The coming election is too important to be decided on a
number,” Welch wrote. “Especially when that number seems so
wrong.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
