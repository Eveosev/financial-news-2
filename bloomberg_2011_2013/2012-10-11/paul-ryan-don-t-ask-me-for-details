With the vice presidential debate set for tonight, the Romney-Ryan tax plan will probably get another poke or two. Democratic partisans no doubt hope that  Joe Biden  will succeed where the somnambulant  Barack Obama  failed. Despite the president's drowsy inquisition last week,  Mitt Romney  avoided identifying the elusive Higgs Boson of his fiscal policy: the magic asterisk that will enable Romney to cut tax rates by 20 percent and balance the budget without leaving the U.S. government gutted and filleted on the banks of the Potomac. (Romney not only sidestepped the essential question, he practically denied ever having heard of his tax plan. For an analysis of the missing math, read this  Josh Barro post .) Now it's  Paul Ryan 's turn. When he came to Bloomberg View for an editorial meeting on April 10 (here's  the full transcript ) Ryan made a telling point about the relationship between campaigning and governing: It would be "disingenuous and dishonest" he said, not to explain to voters in a campaign what you intend to do after the election. Ryan was speaking specifically in the context of a lame duck Congress. But his emphasis on an informed electorate was undeniable.Â  "I just don't think that's good governing," he said. Apparently that logic doesn't apply to the need to reveal details of a fundamental fiscal overhaul with huge implications for the size and purpose of government and the nature of the social contract. Steven Rattner , who attended the View meeting, questioned Ryan on what deductions and loopholes would have to be eliminated to make his own budget plan work. (The exchange, which you can find in the transcript, is quite lengthy.) Ryan here shows that when it comes to nailing down the details, he and Romney present a unified wall of Jell-O.
