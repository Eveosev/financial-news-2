American Water Works Co., the
biggest publicly traded water utility in the U.S., said its
Pennsylvania unit today began work replacing more than 10 miles
of aging water pipes in the Pittsburgh area.  Costs of the upgrades and network improvements that will
improve pressure and boost fire protection for residents will be
about $13.4 million, the company said in a statement. Some of
the water mains are more than 100 years old, it said.  American Water is based in Voorhees, N.J., and its
Pennsylvania subsidiary is the largest water utility in that
state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
