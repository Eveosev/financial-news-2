Roger Federer  defeated Stanislas Wawrinka in three sets at the Shanghai Masters to assure the No.
1 spot in the men’s tennis world rankings for a record-extending
300th week.  Federer won 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-0 in the third-round match at
the Qi Zhong Tennis Center. The record 17-time Grand Slam
singles champion fought off a break point at 4-4 in the second
set before winning the tiebreaker, then broke early in the third
to take control of the match.  Federer, the 31-year-old top seed, extends his record of
holding the top spot in the ATP World Tour  Rankings . He also
improves to 12-1 all-time against Wawrinka, his friend and
frequent Swiss Davis Cup teammate, winning all nine meetings on
hard courts.  “I’m happy that I’m able to reach 300,” Federer, who tied
Pete Sampras’s mark of 286 weeks at No. 1 by beating  Andy Murray 
in July’s Wimbledon final, said in a televised interview. “It’s
an amazing number and record for me.”  Federer next plays No. 10 Marin Cilic of Croatia, who beat
Fernando Verdasco 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, in the quarterfinals. Second-
seed Novak Djokovic of Serbia and Murray, the No. 3 seed from
Britain, advanced to the final eight in straight sets.  Djokovic beat Spain’s  Feliciano Lopez  and next meets
Germany’s  Tommy Haas , who defeated No. 6 Janko Tipsarevic of
Serbia. Murray beat Alexandr Dolgopolov of Ukraine to set up a
quarterfinal with Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic, who beat
eight-seeded American  John Isner .  No. 4 Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic beat Sam Querrey
of the U.S. in three sets and will next play No. 5 Jo-Wilfried
Tsonga of France, a 6-2, 7-6 (7-2) winner over Marcos Baghdatis
of Cyprus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
