The National Hockey League and its
players’ union made no progress yesterday toward ending a
lockout that Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said has cost almost
$250 million.  The sides discussed medical, health and safety and
miscellaneous issues in the latest talks about a new collective
bargaining agreement, Daly said.  “We had no discussion of major economic issues,” Daly
told reporters. “That continues to be a disappointment from our
perspective.”  Owners and players are arguing about how to split revenue
and other issues including salary arbitration and the length of
unrestricted free agency.  The decision to cancel the first two weeks of the regular
season means “$250 million is in jeopardy,” Daly said. The
league has “a little bit of time” before deciding whether to
cancel additional games, he said.  It’s not the players who are forcing the cancellation of
regular-season games, said Steve Fehr, special counsel
representing the players’ union.  “Games are canceled because the league chose to continue
the lockout,” he told reporters yesterday.  The league locked out players on Sept. 16, the day after
the collective bargaining agreement expired.  “Our message to the players’ association is we encourage
them to make a proposal,” Daly said. “Any movement is better
than no movement at all, even if we move sideways.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
