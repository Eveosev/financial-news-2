The U.K.’s Petroleum Industry
Association warned that new legislation may add to costs,
threatening the refining industry, which has seen two plant
closures since 2009.  “We calculate that new legislative impacts could add a
further 0.35 pence per liter of costs, leaving close to zero
return on capital employed, which is unsustainable,” the
London-based organization said today in a report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
