The Jacksonville Jaguars will host
the San Francisco 49ers in a National Football League regular-
season game in London in 2013.  The Jaguars announced in August they will play one home
game at Wembley Stadium from 2013 to 2016. Next season’s game
will be played Oct. 27.  “This is a unique and important opportunity for the
Jaguars franchise, as well as for our fans and community,”
owner  Shahid Khan , who took control of the team in January, said
in a  statement . “To share this stage in our first year at
Wembley with a rising power like the 49ers will bring additional
attention and respect to what we’re trying to achieve as a
franchise.”  San Francisco is tied with Arizona for first place in
National Football Conference’s Western Division with a 4-1
record. The Jaguars are 1-4, tied with Tennessee for last in the
American Football Conference’s South Division.  The NFL has played regular-season games at Wembley since
2007. The  St. Louis Rams  will host the  New England Patriots  on
Oct. 28. The Rams in August withdrew from a commitment to play
games in London in 2013 and 2014.  The Jaguars will be playing in London for the first time.
San Francisco beat Denver 24-16 in its previous appearance at
Wembley in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
