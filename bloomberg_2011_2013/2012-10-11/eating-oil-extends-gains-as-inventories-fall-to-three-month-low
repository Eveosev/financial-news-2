Heating oil futures extended gains
after the Energy Department reported distillate supplies fell
more than expected last week to a three-month low.  The government said heating oil and diesel  inventories 
declined 3.18 million barrels to 120.9 million in the week ended
Oct. 5. The median estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for a 1 million-barrel decrease.  Heating oil for November delivery rose 4.75 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $3.2605 a gallon at 11:04 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices were $3.2553 before the reportâ€™s
release at 11 a.m. in Washington.  Gasoline supplies fell 534,000 barrels to 195.4 million in
the seven days ended Oct. 5, according to department data.
Analysts estimated a 250,000-barrel increase, according to the
survey.  November-delivery gasoline rose 0.94 cent, or 0.3 percent,
to $2.9687 a gallon, from $3.962 before the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
