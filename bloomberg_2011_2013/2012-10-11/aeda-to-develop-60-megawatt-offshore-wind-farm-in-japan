Maeda Corp. (1824) , a Japanese civil
engineering company, will develop a 60-megawatt offshore wind
farm in southwestern  Japan .  The project, to be built off the coast of Shimonoseki city
in Yamaguchi prefecture, will use 20 turbines and may cost as
much as 25 billion yen ($320 million), Kozo Domori, a Maeda
spokesman said today by phone.  The wind farm will be built in two stages, with the first
10 turbines starting operation in April 2016 and the remaining
the following year, he said.  The company is seeking investors for the project that is
expected to earn about 3.5 billion yen a year from electricity
sales when completed, Domori said, confirming an earlier report
by the Nikkei newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
