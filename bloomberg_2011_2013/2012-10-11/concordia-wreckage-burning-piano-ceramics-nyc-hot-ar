The cruise ship that capsized off
the Italian coast last January is recalled in a huge
installation at the Gladstone gallery in Chelsea by Swiss artist
Thomas Hirschhorn.  Hirshhorn spent six weeks organizing “Concordia,
Concordia,” which measures 52 feet deep, 33 feet wide and 25
feet high.  It’s as if the floor had tilted 90 degrees, tossing chairs,
sofas, bar stools, life jackets and a floor lamp amid mounds of
stuff that evoke the passengers on a pleasure trip that ended in
death for 32 when the captain got distracted.  A grand piano is attached to a wall, once the floor, while
a replica of Gericault’s “The Raft of the Medusa” hangs limply
from what is now the ceiling.  The scale and detail of this orchestrated chaos inspire
horror and also curiosity at who might wish to live with it.  The gallery declined to reveal the price because the work
has been sold. The show runs through Oct. 20 at 530 W. 21st St.;

destruction in a two-hour video titled “The End of
Civilization.”  A grand piano, symbol it would seem of mankind’s highest
cultural achievements, is shown burning in green, rolling hills
near the border between  England  and  Scotland .  Projected onto screens -- one for the wide shots of the
serene landscape at dusk, another for the close-ups of raging
flames -- the film is exquisitely meditative.  You can walk around the screens (they stand at an angle to
each other in the middle of the gallery; in a corner, a third
screen shows the fire at a different stage), watching the
intensity of light change as the fire consumes the instrument.  Gordon’s auction record for a video is $96,000. The show
runs through Oct. 13 at 522 W. 21st St.; +1-212-741-1717;

somewhat chaotic exhibition of ceramic sculptures and paintings
by Italian artist Alessandro Pessoli at Anton Kern gallery.  Human heads and birds appear throughout the show, painted
on sail-like canvases or as ceramic figures, alluding to Bosch,
the Commedia dell’arte, children’s stories and pirate
adventures. Seductive glazes and colors force you to keep
looking and deciphering.  Prices range from $3,000 to $80,000. The show runs through
Oct. 20 at 532 W. 20th St.; +1-212-367-9663;

Boakye, London-based artist of Ghanaian descent, populates her
paintings with fictional characters, mostly black subjects
looking unsmilingly at the viewer. Ranging from small to large,
the works combine brushy expressionism with smooth areas hiding
the artist’s hand.  The dark palette creates a sense of mystery and depth. In
“Bracken or Moss,” the only bright spots are the whites of the
man’s eyes and a touch of crimson around his neck.  Prices range from $15,000 to $45,000. “All Manner of
Needs” runs through Oct. 13 at 513 W.20th St.; +1-212-645-1701;
