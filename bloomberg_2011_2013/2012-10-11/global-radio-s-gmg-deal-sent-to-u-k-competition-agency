Global Radio Group Ltd.’s completed
acquisition of GMG Radio Holdings Ltd. was sent to the U.K.’s
 Competition Commission  for a detailed probe, Britain’s  Office of
Fair Trading  said today.  “The OFT found that the loss of competition between the
parties in a number of regional and local areas gave rise to
concerns that the merger could result in increased prices for
advertisers,” the antitrust agency said in a statement.  Global Radio, which owns Britain’s Classic FM station,
purchased GMG Radio, which operates several stations across the
U.K. under the Real or Smooth brand, in June. It didn’t disclose
the price it paid to Guardian Media Group.  Maria Miller, the U.K.’s culture secretary, decided earlier
today that the deal shouldn’t be reviewed on media plurality
grounds and should be treated as an ordinary merger, the OFT
said. Her predecessor,  Jeremy Hunt , previously ordered the
agency and media regulator Ofcom to examine whether the deal was
in the public interest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
