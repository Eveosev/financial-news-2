A drop in coffee prices on good
flowering in  Brazil  for the 2013 crop is prompting producers in
the country, the world’s largest grower, to store production and
wait for a price rally, a producer’s association said today.  The Brazilian Coffee Council is also concerned with low
government inventories of the product and is proposing an
auction for as many of 6 million bags of Arabica coffee, the
association known as CNC said today in an e-mail report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
