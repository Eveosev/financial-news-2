Net borrowing  by Spanish banks from
the  European Central Bank  fell in September for the first time
in a year as funding conditions for lenders eased.  Net average ECB borrowing dropped to 378.2 billion euros
($487.1 billion) from 388.7 billion euros in August, the Bank of
Spain said on its website today.  Gross borrowing  was 399.9
billion euros, down from 411.7 billion euros a month earlier.  The July pledge by ECB President  Mario Draghi  to do
“whatever it takes” to defend the euro has helped reduce
borrowing costs and opened the door for banks including  Banco
Santander SA (SAN)  and  Banco Sabadell SA (SAB)  to sell bonds. The net ECB
borrowing figure of 378.2 billion euros compares with 69.3
billion euros a year earlier, a sign of how reliant Spanish
lenders have become on ECB funding.  “Since Draghi’s ‘whatever it takes’ speech, funding
conditions have gotten better for Spain and the other peripheral
nations,” said Tobias Blattner, an economist at Daiwa
International in London. He said it was still too early to read
a firm trend in the improved September numbers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
