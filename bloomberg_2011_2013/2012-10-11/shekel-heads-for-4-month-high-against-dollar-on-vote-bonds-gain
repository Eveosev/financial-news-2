The shekel headed for the highest
level in almost four months against the dollar and bonds rose as
investors shifted their focus to a growing economy as worries
over a military strike on  Iran  diminished.  The shekel strengthened as much as 0.6 percent against the
dollar, before increasing 0.3 percent to 3.8521 at 4:37 p.m.,
poised for the highest settlement since June 19. The currency
climbed as much as 0.4 percent against the euro before trading
0.2 percent lower at 4.9861. The yield on the benchmark bond due
2022 dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
4.18 percent.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Oct. 9 called
elections for early next year, while Bank of Israel Governor
Stanley Fischer said today the economy is on path to grow 3.3
percent this year. The U.S. and its allies have imposed economic
sanctions on Iran to coax the government into abandoning any
plans to develop nuclear weapons.  “The Iran war talk has eased a bit as both the U.S. and
Israeli leaders prepare for elections,” said Rony Gitlin, head
of spot trading at Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd. “The market is
recognizing that along with decent Israeli economic growth,
there is a new sense of relative stability.”  One-year  interest rate swaps,  an indicator of investor
expectations for the benchmark rate in the period, fell one
basis point to 2.14 percent. The Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index, which
measures inflation-linked and fixed-rate corporate bonds, gained
0.5 percent to 274.95, to the highest since Bloomberg started
tracking the data in February 2008  The two-year break-even rate, the yield difference between
the inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government bonds of
similar maturity, widened two basis points to 279. That implies
an average annual inflation rate of 2.79 percent over the
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
