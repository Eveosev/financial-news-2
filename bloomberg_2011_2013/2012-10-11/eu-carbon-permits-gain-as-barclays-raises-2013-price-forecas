European Union carbon permits gained
1.2 percent as Barclays Plc increased its price forecast for the
allowances next year by 13 percent, citing EU plans to delay
auctioning some allowances from 2013.  EU permits for delivery in December rose 9 cents to 7.81
euros ($10.10) a metric ton on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Prices next year in the bloc’s carbon market will
average 8.50 euros a ton, up from a prediction of 7.50 euros
previously,  Trevor Sikorski , an analyst at the bank in London,
said today in a report.  “We maintain our forecast that 700 million tons will be
back-ended but assume that 60 percent of those volumes are taken
out of 2013,” Sikorski said. “We now assume the volumes only
come back in from 2018 onwards.”  The European Commission, the bloc’s regulator, is seeking
to delay some supply of permits to boost carbon prices, which
fell to a record 5.99 euros on April 4. The market had a glut of
950 million permits at the end of 2011, and this surplus is
“growing fast,” Jos Delbeke, Director General for Climate at
the European Commission, said in Brussels on Sept. 26.  United Nations carbon offsets for December advanced 1.7
percent to 1.77 euros a ton on ICE Futures  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
