Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , the maker of
electric cars led by  Elon Musk , received a $10 million grant
from California to buy assembly equipment and add 500 workers to
build a rechargeable sport-utility vehicle in the state.  The California Energy Commission awarded the funds to
reimburse Tesla for machinery purchased to equip its Fremont,
California, factory to produce the battery-powered  Model X 
crossover, Alison apRoberts, a spokeswoman for the agency, said
yesterday. Tesla is investing $50.2 million for the project and
adding the jobs to qualify for the grant that’s funded by
vehicle registration fees, she said.  “Development of Model X is under way and we’re scheduled
to go into production in 2014,” said Christina Ra, spokeswoman
for Palo Alto, California-based Tesla. The company’s Fremont
plant currently has more than 1,500 people producing Model S
sedans, lithium-ion battery packs and electric motors, she said.  Tesla raised about $200 million in a secondary stock
offering last week, and also said it planned to make an early
payment on U.S. Energy Department loans received in 2009 to
develop and build the Model S. Musk, 41, said the company plans
to be “ cash flow  positive” as early as next month, and
profitable by 2013.  The company said Sept. 25 that it plans this year to
deliver about 3,000 units of the Model S, down from an initial
goal of 5,000. The sedan starts at $57,400. Tesla hasn’t
provided pricing or production details for the SUV, which
features distinctive “falcon-wing” doors and is touted by Musk
as faster than Porsche AG’s 911 sports car and roomier than  Audi
AG (NSU) ’s Q7 SUV.  Tesla bought and refurbished the Fremont plant in 2010 that
operated as a joint venture of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and the
predecessor of  General Motors Co. (GM)  until 2009. The factory opened
as a GM plant in the early 1960s.  Tesla fell 0.3 percent to $28.32 at the close in New York.
The  shares  have declined 0.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
