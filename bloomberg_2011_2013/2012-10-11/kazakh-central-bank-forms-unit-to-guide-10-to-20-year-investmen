Kazakhstan’s central bank created a
unit to oversee investments of a 10 to 20-year duration to
diversify and increase returns on its holdings.  JSC National Investment Corporation of the National Bank of
Kazakhstan will invest reserves and National Oil Fund money in
“traditional and alternative assets in international financial
markets,” the Almaty-based bank said in an e-mailed statement
today. Yeszhan Birtanov was named chief executive officer of the
company, according to the statement.  Kazakhstan, the biggest oil producer in central Asia, is
seeking to boost returns on its reserves after its 7.4 trillion
tenge ($49 billion) National Oil Fund reaped 60 billion tenge in
investment profit last year. Assets in the Kazakh National Oil
Fund, which is managed by the central bank, and foreign-exchange
 reserves  amounted to $85.5 billion in September.  “The formation of the corporation is a necessary step in
the current economic reality,” the central bank said in the
statement. “It can be seen as a qualitative modification of the
concept and conduct of international assets management. This
will increase profitability and promote further diversification
of international assets of Kazakhstan.”  -- Editors: Paul Abelsky, Alan Crosby  To contact the reporter on this story:
