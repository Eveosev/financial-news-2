Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) , the second-
largest U.S. natural gas producer, is offering some Oklahoma
drilling leases for sale to help plug a gap between cash flow
and expenses.  Chesapeake is seeking buyers for 28,360 net acres in three
counties west of the Colony Wash field, according to a posting
on Meagher Energy Advisors website today. The asset doesn’t
include any of Chesapeake’s drilling sites in the neighboring
Texas panhandle, site of a June discovery called Hogshooter that
was the biggest gusher in the company’s 23-year history.  Chesapeake climbed 3.6 percent to $20.14 at the close in
 New York .  The acreage for sale has 117 wells already drilled in it,
according to today’s posting. Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake is
selling the asset “because its current drilling budget is not
sufficient to fully develop its leasehold in this area,” the
listing said.  Chesapeake is targeting as much as $14 billion in asset
sales this year and $5 billion in 2013 to cover a funding gap
aggravated by a slump in U.S. gas prices. Chesapeake has used
Meagher’s website to advertise other asset sales this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
