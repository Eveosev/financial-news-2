Wheat rose, capping the longest
rally in seven weeks, after the U.S. Department of Agriculture
lowered its forecast for global stockpiles and said domestic
cattle producers will use more of the grain as livestock feed.  Global stockpiles will be 173 million metric tons on May
31, down from 176.71 million estimated on Sept. 12, the USDA
said today in a report. World production was forecast at 653.05
million tons, down 0.9 percent from last month. About 315
million bushels in the U.S. will be fed to cattle, up from last
month’s estimate of 220 million, the USDA said.  “The wheat crop in  Russia  is down, Canada is down,
 Australia  is down,” Jason Britt, the president of Central
States Commodities Inc., a Kansas City, Missouri-based broker,
said in a telephone interview. “There seems to be a trend.”  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 1.9 percent to
settle at $8.86 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since Sept.
28. The price gained for the fourth straight day, the longest
rally since late August. The grain has climbed 41 percent since
mid-June after a drought scorched the Midwest.  Australian production was forecast at 23 million tons, down
12 percent from September, and Russian output was cut to 38
million tons from 39 million, USDA data show. Canadian farmers
will harvest 26.7 million tons, down from 27 million estimated
last month. The U.S. was expected to be the top exporter this
year, followed by  Canada , Australia and Russia.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
