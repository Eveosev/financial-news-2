New York Times Co. (NYT) , the newspaper
publishing company, rose the most in two months after Barclays
Plc upgraded the stock, citing increasing  revenue  from its
digital paywall and a better cash position.  Times Co.  advanced  3.7 percent to $10.35 at the close in 
New York for the biggest jump since Aug. 8. The shares have 
gained 34 percent this year.  The company is working to increase its digital expertise
and has accelerated a shift to the Internet as print advertising
declines. In the second quarter, digital subscriptions for the
New York Times and International Herald Tribune rose 12 percent
from the prior period. In August, Times Co. named former British
Broadcasting Corp. director Mark Thompson as chief executive
officer to help lead the electronic push.  “The increase in circulation revenues from the company’s
digital paywall is now meaningful enough to offset the decline
in print advertising,” Kannan Venkateshwar, a New York-based
analyst for Barclays, wrote in a note today, where he upgraded
the shares to the equivalent of buy, from equalweight, or
neutral. “It is also adding to its Sunday home delivery
subscriber base now after many years of decline.”  There’s also “increased likelihood of cash return to
equity holders, ” since Times Co. is sitting on “pro forma
cash of $935 million” after generating $650 million from the
sale of non-core assets, he wrote.  Times Co. introduced the digital paywall in March 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
