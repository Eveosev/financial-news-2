Australians have the world’s highest
median worth and the Asia-Pacific topped Europe as the largest
wealth-holding region, according to  Credit Suisse Group AG. (CSGN)   Australians have a median wealth per adult of $193,653, the
Credit Suisse global wealth report showed, the highest of 216
countries surveyed. With plentiful land, sparse population,
natural resources and high home prices,  Australia ’s proportion
of individuals with wealth above $100,000 is the most of any
country and eight times the world average, the report said.  Europe’s sovereign debt-crisis contributed to a $10.9
trillion loss in the value of household assets in that region
during the past year, according to the report.  “These are times of unprecedented economic change, and a
radical reconfiguration of the world’s economic order is taking
shape,” said Francesco de Ferrari, Singapore-based head of
private banking for Asia Pacific at Credit Suisse. “Asia-
Pacific, which makes up two thirds of the world’s middle class
of emerging consumers, remains the key growth engine of the
world economy and global wealth.”  A global economic slowdown has prompted policymakers from
the U.S. to  Europe  and  China  to add to stimulus measures in 2012
to boost growth. In Australia, central bank Governor Glenn
Stevens has been cutting interest rates to revive demand outside
of a resource boom that may peak earlier than previously
forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
