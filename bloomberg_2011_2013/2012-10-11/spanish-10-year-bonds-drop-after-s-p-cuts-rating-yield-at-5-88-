 Standard & Poor’s .  The  10-year bond yield  climbed eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 5.88 percent at 7:31 a.m. London time,
widening the yield difference over similar-maturity benchmark
German bunds to 443 basis points.  Two-year note rates advanced 12 basis points to 3.39
percent. Spain’s rating was lowered two levels to BBB- from
BBB+, New York-based S&P said in a statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
