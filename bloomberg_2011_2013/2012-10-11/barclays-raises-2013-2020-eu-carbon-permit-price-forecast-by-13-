Barclays Plc raised its price
estimate for European Union carbon permits in the third phase of
the bloc’s carbon market by 13 percent, citing plans to delay
auctioning some allowances from next year.  EU permits in the eight years through 2020 will average 9
euros ($11.65) a metric ton, up from an estimate of 8 euros
previously,  Trevor Sikorski , an analyst at the bank in London,
said in a report today.  “We maintain our forecast that 700 million tons will be
back-ended but assume that 60 percent of those volumes are taken
out of 2013,” Sikorski said. “We now assume the volumes only
come back in from 2018 onwards.”  The European Commission, the bloc’s regulator, is seeking
to delay some supply of permits to boost carbon prices, which
fell to a record 5.99 euros on April 4. The market had a glut of
950 million permits at the end of 2011, and this surplus is
“growing fast,”  Jos Delbeke , Director General for Climate at
the European Commission, said in Brussels on Sept. 26.  Prices for EU permits next year will average 8.50 euros, up
from the previous forecast of 7.50 euros, Sikorski said.  “We remain bearish on the fourth quarter and the first
quarter of 2013 but note that a large set-aside could create
demand for the heavy EUA sales profile we expect,” he said.  The EU market will be 1.6 billion tons oversupplied by the
end of 2012 and the glut won’t disappear until 2016, Sikorski
said. The 2012 oversupply reflects a surplus of 614 million EU
permits, and the use of 1 billion United Nations carbon offsets,
according to the report.  UN Offsets  UN offset prices in the third phase of the EU market will
average 1.50 euros, down from the previous forecast of 3.50
euros, Sikorski said.  “The shrinking prospects of future demand suggest that
there is little way back for credits” from the UN’s Clean
Development Mechanism, he said. UN offset prices have fallen 77
percent in the last year.  The EU has a cap on the use of CERs of 1.8 billion in the
13 years through 2020. The UN has issued 1.02 billion credits
since October 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
