Singapore ’s stockpiles of residual
fuels rose to the highest level in three weeks, according to
data from the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore inventories of  residues , a category that includes
fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy residue and excludes bitumen,
increased 9.5 percent to 19.6 million barrels in the week ended
yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore , a unit of the
ministry, said today in an e-mailed statement. Supplies are at
the highest level since Sept. 19.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  such as naphtha, reformate
and gasoline fell 3 percent to 10.1 million barrels. Middle
distillates such as gasoil and kerosene rose 3.2 percent to 9.4
million barrels, the most since Sept. 12.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners, oil companies and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
