Russia requires $600 billion of
investment over the next 20 years to maintain  oil production  at
its current level, according to TNK-BP.  The country faces a challenge to offset the drop in output
from brownfield, or existing, sites by fully developing
greenfield, or new deposits, Jonathan Kollek, senior vice-
president of sales, trading and logistics at TNK-BP, said today
at a conference in Geneva. “However, if this challenge is met
in the right way, Russian companies have the chance to develop
into super oil majors.”  Output in brownfield sites in Western Siberia decreased by
more than 20 million metric tons from its peak level in 2006 to
400,000 barrels a day, Kollek said. Russia has discovered fields
that possess a potential production of 100 million to 150
million tons a year, he said.  Russia’s crude and condensate output climbed to a post-
Soviet record of 10.41 million barrels a day in September,
according to data from the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit on
Oct. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
