Ethiopia’s government will sign a two-
year contract with Huawei Technologies Co. and  ZTE Corp. (000063)  within
weeks, Communication and Information Technology Minister
Debretsion Gebremichael said.  ZTE,  China ’s second-largest maker of phone equipment, said
in May it was bidding with Huawei for a $1.3 billion government
telecommunications contract.  “Both companies will be engaged,” Debretsion said in an
interview in the capital, Addis Ababa, yesterday, without giving 
the size of the contract. “Both will have a share in the market.”  ZTE, about one-third owned by the Chinese government, has
worked with Ethiopia’s state-owned monopoly provider Ethio
Telecom over the past six years to improve phone and Internet
services in  Africa ’s second-most populous nation.  The companies will finance the project that
includes more than doubling the number of mobile-phone users to
40 million by mid-2015, Debretsion said.  “We are not investing; we are inviting companies to come
with their finance,” he said. “That is why we are waiting for
the negotiation.”  Agreements including technical details and how to divide
the work between the companies should be made within two weeks,
Debretsion said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
