The government of  Iran  carried out
as many as 223 executions, of which 82 were done in secret, in
the first five months of this year, a United Nations
investigator said.  Ahmed Shaheed, the UN special rapporteur on the human
rights situation in Iran, said in a report made public today
that at least 141 officially announced executions took place
between January and early June 2012. A further 82 executions
were done in secret in that same period, according to the
report.  Under Iranian law, the death sentence can be applied for
crimes such as alcohol consumption, adultery and drug
trafficking. Two men were sentenced to death in June for
drinking, the report says.  There were 53 executions across the country during one week
in May, according to the report.  “A large number of those sentenced to death were convicted
in the absence of fair trial standards,” Shaheed wrote in the
report.  There have been 3,766 floggings since 2002, with 1,444 in
2009 alone, according to the report. Common charges include
adultery, public disruption such as taking part in “illegal
gatherings” and drug offenses.  Shaheed, who wasn’t allowed to enter Iran to assess the
situation, said his 22-page report is based on 99 interviews of
which 75 were first-hand accounts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
