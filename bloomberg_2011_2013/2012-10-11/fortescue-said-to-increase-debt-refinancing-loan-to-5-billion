loan itâ€™s seeking to refinance debt to $5 billion from $4.5
billion, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction.   The five-year debt will now pay interest at 4.25 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, down from
4.75 percentage points, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the terms are private. The Libor floor also
