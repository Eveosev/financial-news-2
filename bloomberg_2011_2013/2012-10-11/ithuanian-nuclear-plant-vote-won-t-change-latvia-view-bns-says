A Lithuanian referendum this week on
a proposed nuclear-power plant probably won’t change Latvia’s
plans to participate in the project, Latvian Economy Minister
Daniels Pavluts told the  Baltic News Service .  Latvia hasn’t given final approval to participate in the
project because it’s in talks with  Lithuania  and Japan’s  Hitachi
Ltd. (6501) , which will build the plant, on issues including the supply
of resources and nuclear waste, Pavluts told the news service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
