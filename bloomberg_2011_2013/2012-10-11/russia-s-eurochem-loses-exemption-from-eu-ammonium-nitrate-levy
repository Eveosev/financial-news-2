Russia’s EuroChem Group faces a
European Union tariff on ammonium nitrate because the EU
withdrew approval of a minimum-price pledge that the company
made to win an exemption from the levy.  The EU said EuroChem will be subject to the duty of 32.82
euros ($42.48) a metric ton because the company’s acquisition of
a fertilizer production and sales facility in the bloc creates
“a high risk of cross-compensation.” Earlier this year,
EuroChem completed the purchases of a nitrogen-fertilizer
distribution unit from  Germany ’s  K+S AG (SDF)  and of Belgian
fertilizer assets from  BASF SE. (BAS)   “The undertaking accepted from the EuroChem Group becomes
impracticable and therefore should be withdrawn,” the European
Commission, the EU’s trade authority in Brussels, said today in
the  Official Journal . The decision will take effect tomorrow.  The levy on EuroChem is part of EU trade protection against
Russian makers of ammonium nitrate for allegedly selling it in
the 27-nation bloc below cost, a practice known as dumping.
Seeking to help EU producers including BASF, the bloc in July
2008 renewed for five years an anti-dumping duty on Russian
ammonium nitrate of 47.07 euros a ton while lowering the rate
against EuroChem to 32.82 euros a ton and exempting the company
from the levy in return for its price pledge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
