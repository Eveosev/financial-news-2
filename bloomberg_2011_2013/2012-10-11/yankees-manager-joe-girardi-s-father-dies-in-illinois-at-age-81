The father of  New York  Yankees
manager  Joe Girardi  died Oct. 6, according to  Deiters  Funeral
Home & Crematory in  Washington ,  Illinois . He was 81.  Jerry Girardi, of East Peoria, Illinois, had  Alzheimer’s
disease . He is survived by four sons, a daughter and six
grandchildren. His wife, Angela, died in 1984.  “It’s been somewhat difficult,” Joe Girardi said at a
news conference in New York today. “One of the reasons I didn’t
say anything is I knew talking about it might make it even
harder.”  The Yankees said they will observe a moment of silence in
honor of Jerry Girardi before they play the Baltimore Orioles
tonight in Game 4 of the American League Division Series at
Yankee Stadium. A win gives the Yankees a spot in the AL
Championship Series.  Girardi said his father, who took him to Chicago Cubs games
as a child, would always emphasize to him the importance of
“finishing the job at hand,” and that was another reason he
didn’t share news of the death.  “My thought process was, my dad would want me to do
everything we could do to win a  World Series ,” he said. “For
the most part, no one knew. I didn’t want to have to deal with
the team and the team to have to deal with it. I really haven’t
met with them to tell them.”  Burial is scheduled for Oct. 15, which is an off-day in the
ALCS.  “I was going to tell the team if God willing we got into
the next round and I wouldn’t be at the workout on Monday,”
Girardi said. “I didn’t want it out.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
