The  orange  crop in Florida, the
world’s second-biggest grower, will be 5 percent larger
than last season, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said,
as favorable weather aids crops.  The state will produce 154 million boxes in the
harvest that’s just getting under way, up from a revised
146.6 million in the previous season and the biggest in
four years, the USDA said today in its first  estimate  for
the crop. The average forecast of seven analysts and
traders in a Bloomberg News survey was 152.4 million boxes.
A box weighs 90 pounds, or 41 kilograms.  “The trees look great,” Michael Smith, the president
of T&K Futures and Options in Port St. Lucie,  Florida , said
in an e-mail before the report. Anything over 155 million
boxes would need “perfect growing conditions, and that
rarely happens,” he said.  Orange juice futures have tumbled 34 percent this year
amid slowing demand in the U.S. and on expectations for a
bigger crop in Florida. Yesterday, the November contract
fell 0.6 percent to $1.113 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York.  Florida’s yields will average 1.61 gallons per box,
down from 1.63 gallons a year earlier, the USDA said.  The state’s harvest runs into July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
