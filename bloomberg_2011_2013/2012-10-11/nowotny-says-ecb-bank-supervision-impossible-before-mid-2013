European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said it won’t be possible for the
central bank to begin supervising euro-area banks before the
middle of next year.  “Quality comes before speed,” Nowotny, who heads
 Austria ’s central bank, said in  Tokyo  today. “Realistically
that means that on Jan. 1, 2013, the logistical foundations will
be in place. Operationally, it won’t be possible before the
middle of 2013.”  European leaders in June agreed to hand the Frankfurt-based
ECB powers to oversee all euro-area banks as part of a so-called
banking union that would unlock joint recapitalization funds for
the region’s ailing lenders. While leaders set a start date of
Jan. 1, 2013, the ECB is pushing for more time.  Nowotny said the economic outlook for the euro area has
worsened, as reflected in a report published by the
 International Monetary Fund  this week.  “Overall, we see a deterioration of the global economic
outlook,” he said. “Within the euro area, we see a divergence
between south and north. That means, for the ECB as central bank
for the euro area, it won’t be easy to set policy.”  Nowotny also said he sees no need to change ECB interest
rates at the moment, with inflation expected to drop below the
central bank’s 2 percent limit next year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
