Starwood Property Trust (STWD) , founded by
investor  Barry Sternlicht , said it issued loans totaling $107
million on two Blackstone Group LP office buildings as well as a
hotel in Rockville, Maryland, owned by closely held JBG Cos.  Starwood, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, originated a $61
million loan for the two Blackstone buildings in Glendale,
California, which have a total of 419,000 square feet (39,000
square meters), the lender said today in a statement. It also
loaned $46 million to JBG, a  Chevy Chase , Maryland-based real
estate investment manager, for the Hilton Washington,
D.C./Rockville Hotel & Executive Meeting Center.  Starwood executives are “focused on identifying
origination opportunities in attractive markets with strong
sponsors, and believe both of these deals meet these criteria,”
Boyd Fellows, the company’s president, said in the statement.  This year, Starwood has been investing about $500 million a
quarter in whole loans like the ones announced today along with
mezzanine loans, which have higher interest rates, and junior
notes, Fellows said in an e-mail today. The 2012 lending level
is similar to last year’s, he said. The Blackstone and JBG loans
will be kept on Starwood’s balance sheet and are “not intended
to be securitized,” he said, declining to provide additional
details of the financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
