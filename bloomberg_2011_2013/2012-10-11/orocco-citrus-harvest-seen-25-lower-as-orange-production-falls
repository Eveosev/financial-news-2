Morocco ’s citrus harvest probably
slumped 25 percent in 2011-12 as lower rainfall and hot weather
in May and July hurt the orange crop, the country’s Agriculture
Ministry reported.  Rainfall declined 36 percent to 241 millimeters (9.49
inches) in the year compared with normal precipitation of 375
millimeters, the ministry wrote in a  statement  on its website
dated Oct. 8.  The citrus harvest fell to about 1.5 million tons,
according to the ministry, which didn’t provide a year-earlier
figure. Orange production is estimated to have declined 27
percent to 763,000 tons, while output of small citrus fruits
slipped 24 percent to 675,000 tons, it said.  “The decline in citrus production is not unique to
Morocco, it is generalized across the Mediterranean basin and
affects the biggest producer countries,” the ministry wrote.
“This situation will translate into sustained export prices.”  Export availability in the Mediterranean region may slide
15 percent to 20 percent, according to the report.  Morocco accounts for about 10 percent of citrus production
in the Mediterranean region,  data  from the European Fresh
Produce Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
