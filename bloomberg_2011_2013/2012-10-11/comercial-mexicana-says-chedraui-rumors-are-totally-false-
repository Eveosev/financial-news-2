Mexican retailer Controladora
Comercial Mexicana SAB denied a report it’s in talks to sell
itself to rival Grupo Comercial Chedraui SAB, saying “rumors”
of a deal are “totally false.”  “There does not exist nor has there existed any kind of
approach between the two companies,” Comercial Mexicana said in
a statement to the Mexican stock exchange today. Chedraui denied
the talks in a statement earlier today.  Mexico City-based newspaper Excelsior columnist Dario Celis
reported that Chedraui may buy Comercial Mexicana, citing
sources he didn’t name.  To contact the reporter on this story:
