The  European Central Bank  said
historically low policy rates in the euro area have led to
withdrawals from  money market funds .  “As a consequence of historically low policy rates in the
euro area, net returns on short-term financial instruments have
been meager for quite some time,” the Frankfurt-based central
bank said in its monthly report published today. “In such an
environment, money market funds (MMFs), for instance,
experienced withdrawals in recent quarters.”  With the debt crisis pushing the 17-member euro economy to
the brink of recession, the ECB lowered its benchmark rate to a
historic low of 0.75 percent in July and cut its deposit rate to
zero. ECB President  Mario Draghi  said there were no discussions
about further rate cuts at the central bank’s last meeting on
Oct. 4 in Slovenia.  The Governing Council’s decision to cut the  interest rate 
on the ECB’s deposit facility to zero “triggered some concerns
that further declining money-market yields might cause
intensifying pressure on MMFs with potential negative
consequences for banks’ funding situation,” the ECB said in
today’s report. “The banking industry in the euro area already
seems to have anticipated these progressions, for example by
attracting and maintaining retail deposits held by the non-
financial private sector.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
