Boeing Co. (BA)  won an order for 50
narrow-body 737 jets with a $5 billion catalog value as  Alaska
Air Group Inc. (ALK)  refreshes its mainline fleet and caps a round of
purchases by the biggest U.S. carriers.  About two-thirds of the new aircraft will be used to
replace older 737s in the airline’s fleet of 120 Boeing jets,
with the rest to be used for growth, Chief Financial Officer
Brandon Pedersen said today in a telephone interview. Deliveries
begin in 2015.  “The growth really occurs in the second half of the next
decade,” he said. “We have options for deliveries in 2015
through 2024 and those will really be the mechanism we use to
modulate growth up and down. To the extent we see profitable
opportunities and need more airplanes, we’ll exercise those
options and bring those in.”  The purchase announced today by Seattle-based  Alaska 
completes a round of fleet renewal by the largest U.S. airlines
and brings Boeing’s order book for the 737 Max to 858 since the
model went on sale late last year. Boeing has said it expects
about 1,000 orders for the Max by the end of 2012.  Thirty-seven of Alaska Air’s new planes will be 737 Max
variants that the Chicago-based planemaker developed in response
to  Airbus SAS (EAD) ’s upgraded A320neo narrow-body jet. Many of the
Max aircraft probably will fly to Hawaii, where the carrier
already does 20 percent of its flying, Pedersen said.  Fleet Renewal  Earlier this year,  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  agreed
to buy 150 Boeing 737s, following last year’s purchase of 100
Boeing 737s by  Delta Airlines Inc. (DAL)  and  Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) ’s
order for 208 Boeing 737s. AMR Corp.’s American Airlines agreed
to acquire 460 single-aisle jets split between Boeing and Airbus
in July 2011 before seeking bankruptcy protection in November.  The 737 Max variants will have the Leap engine developed by
 CFM International , a partnership of  General Electric Co. (GE)  and
French manufacturer Safran SA. CFM valued the engine order at
$1.2 billion. The power-plant manufacturer has been the sole
supplier for all 737 jets since 1981.  After average discounts, Alaska’s order is worth $2.57
billion, according to consultant Avitas in Chantilly, Virginia.  The 737 Max is 13 percent more fuel-efficient than the
current-generation models of the jet, which translates into $1
million to $1.5 million in annual fuel savings per plane,
Pedersen said.  Jet-fuel prices  have climbed 42 percent to $3.23 a gallon
in the two years through September, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Boeing rose 0.7 percent to $70.83 at the close in  New York ,
and Alaska Air was little changed at $36.56.  To contact the reporter on this story:
