PensionDanmark A/S will invest 800
million euros ($1.03 billion) in a new fund for infrastructure
assets such as water supply and electricity transmission as it
seeks to counter low bond yields.  The fund will also target biomass  power plants  with
investments in  North America  and western Europe in the next
three to four years, Copenhagen-based PensionDanmark said today
in an e-mailed statement.  Pension funds and insurers are seeking alternative
investments after a decline in  interest rates  hurt bond returns
and equity-market volatility increased. Energy assets offer
long-term, steady gains while renewable power generators are
entitled to premium payments. PensionDanmark said Oct. 8 it
bought shares in three U.S. wind farms from EON AG.  The fund will support PensionDanmarkâ€™s goal of investing
1.6 billion euros in infrastructure in the next four to five
years, according to the statement. The venture will be managed
by Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, which plans to raise a
second fund in three to four years, the statement shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
