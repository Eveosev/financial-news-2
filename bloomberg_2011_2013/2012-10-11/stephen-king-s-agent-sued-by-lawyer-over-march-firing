A lawyer who said he represented
Stephen King for more than 30 years sued the author’s agent,
Arthur Greene, for at least $1 million in damages over his
firing.  Jay D. Kramer was fired March 30, shortly after Greene and
his wife met with King, according to the lawsuit filed today in
New York state Supreme Court in  Manhattan . Kramer said he and
Greene had been discussing the splitting of commissions.  Greene, who also acted as King’s accountant, and his wife,
Susan Greene, were “motivated by resentment toward Mr. Kramer”
and “greed,” according to the complaint.  “Defendants’ misrepresentations and other misdeeds and the
resulting improper termination of Mr. Kramer have also damaged
his reputation in the entertainment industry,” a lawyer for
Kramer, David M. Schreier, said in the complaint.  King was the world’s second-highest-earning author in the
past year, grossing about $39 million, trailing only James
Patterson, according to Forbes.com. Greene, in a telephone
interview, said he represents King and that Kramer “worked for
me.” He declined to comment further.  Greene retained Kramer on King’s behalf in 1978, according
to the complaint. Kramer later worked independently of Greene on
publishing agreements and other work, he claimed.  The case is Kramer v. Greene, 653567-2012, New York State
Supreme Court, County of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
