GDF Suez SA (GSZ) , the owner of Electrabel
in  Belgium , plans annual cost savings in Europe approaching 750
million euros ($965 million) in three years,  De Tijd reported ,
citing a note from unions following a meeting with management.  In the European market, energy demand and prices in many
countries lag behind forecasts, the newspaper said. GDF Suez
forecasts the market share of Electrabel will fall to between 40
percent and 50 percent from 60 percent as clients defect,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
