U.S. stock futures extended gains as
fewer Americans than forecast filed first-time claims for
unemployment benefits last week.  Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index futures expiring in December
added 0.5 percent to 1,433.8 at 8:34 a.m. in New York. The
underlying equity gauge yesterday fell to the lowest level in a
month on concern that the global economy is slowing down and
will hurt corporate earnings.  Applications for jobless benefits dropped 30,000 to 339,000
in the week ended Oct. 6, the fewest since February 2008, Labor
Department figures showed today. Economists forecast 370,000
claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.
One state accounted for most of the plunge in claims, a Labor
Department spokesman said as the data were issued to the press.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
