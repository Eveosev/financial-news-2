The Czech central bank may use a
weaker koruna to ease monetary conditions, boost exports and
counter deflation risks, Governor Miroslav Singer said.  In the case of a “real” need, the “easiest” solution
would be a currency intervention, Singer said in an interview
published today in  Hospodarske Noviny . Weakening the koruna
would be a “logical” step in a country, where exports equal 80
percent of economic output, he said.  The Czech central bank cut  interest rates  to a record-low
0.25 percent on Sept. 27 amid an economic recession. Five
central bank board members voted to reduce the benchmark two-
week repurchase rate by a quarter-point. They also discussed
which policy tools may be used to ease conditions more than
would be accomplished by another rate reduction.  “If we had a feeling that there are long-term deflationary
risks, the most obvious way of how to counter them is via
currency weakening,” Singer told Hospodarske Noviny, adding he
was “satisfied” with the last rate cut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
