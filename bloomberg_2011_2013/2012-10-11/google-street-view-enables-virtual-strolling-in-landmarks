Google Inc. (GOOG)  expanded its Street View
maps feature to enhance images of roadways and attractions in
the U.S. and several other countries, stepping up competition
with  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s new navigation tool.  Google updated images for more than 250,000 miles of roads
worldwide and also enhanced virtual strolls through popular
tourist attractions, the  Mountain View , California-based company
said today on a  blog  post.  Apple decided to build its own navigation application with
the latest iPhone software, reflecting a widening rift with
Google, which had provided its Google Maps program since the
device debuted in 2007. Google earlier this month added Street
View to its maps feature for mobile browsers, improving the
service available to iPhone users who don’t have the tool built
into their handsets.  While Apple’s new software adds features such as turn-by-
turn navigation, it is widely faulted for unreliable landmark
searches, routes that get users lost and a lack of public
transit directions.  Apple’s mapping application was released as part of the new
iOS 6 software, which runs the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. Even
as Apple’s maps were criticized, the company sold a record 5
million iPhones during the handset’s debut weekend. Apple also
said that the software with its new mapping feature was being
used on more than 100 million mobile devices.  Google has been building out its online mapping software
since 2005, using cars and satellites to accumulate data that
helps improve its accuracy and reliability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
