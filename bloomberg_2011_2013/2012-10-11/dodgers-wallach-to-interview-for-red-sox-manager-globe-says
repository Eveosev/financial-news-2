Los Angeles Dodgers third-base coach
Tim Wallach may interview for the job of Boston Red Sox manager
next week, the Boston Globe reported.  The Red Sox favor John Farrell, the manager of the Toronto
Blue Jays for the past two years, although there is no word on
whether they have asked for permission to interview him, the
Globe said. Farrell has a 154-170 record and two fourth-place
finishes in Major League Baseball’s American League East.  Wallach, 55, was a three-time Gold Glove winner and five-
time All-Star at third base for the Montreal Expos. He hit .257
with 260 home runs during his MLB career. He has been the
Dodgers’ third-base coach under Don Mattingly since 2011.  The Red Sox fired manager Bobby Valentine Oct. 4, a day
after his only season with the franchise ended with the team’s
worst record in 47 years. Boston finished 69-93, its first
losing season since 1997.  To contact the reporter on this story:
