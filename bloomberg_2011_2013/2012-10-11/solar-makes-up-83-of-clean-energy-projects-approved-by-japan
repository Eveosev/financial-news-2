The Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry in  Japan  approved clean energy projects totaling 1,780
megawatts of capacity, with solar accounting for 83 percent, as
of the end of September under a government incentive program.  Of that, solar projects totaled 1,480 megawatts, followed
by 292 megawatts in wind projects, the ministry said yesterday
on its  web site . Since April, Japan has added 912 megawatts in
capacity in clean energy with solar projects making up 885
megawatts of the total, the ministry said.  Japan introduced tariffs in July to promote investments in
clean energy. The ministry is projecting Japan will add 2,500
megawatts of clean energy by the end of March following the
introduction in July of so-called feed-in tariffs or subsidies,
which require utilities to buy power from renewable energy
providers at premium prices.  Developers of clean energy projects applying for above-
market rates set by the government need to submit project
applications to the ministry and grid connection application to
power utilities.  As some projects take longer to set up, the approved
projects will not necessarily start operations by the end of
this fiscal year ending in March, according to the ministry.  “Several large-scale solar power plants are scheduled to
start operations toward the end of this fiscal year so the non-
residential solar sector is expected to expand,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
