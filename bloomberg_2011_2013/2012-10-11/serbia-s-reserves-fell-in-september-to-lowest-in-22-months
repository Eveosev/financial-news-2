Serbia’s foreign-exchange reserves
slipped to their lowest level since November 2010 as debt
servicing took more than all inflows combined.  Reserves dropped to 9.83 billion euros ($12.7 billion) at
the end of September from 9.9 billion euros in August, as the
Balkan nation repaid 113.8 million euros to foreign creditors,
the Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said in an e-mail today.  Inflows included 46.6 million euros in new mandatory
reserves set aside by commercial lenders, 39.7 million euros
from euro-denominated bonds sold on the local market as well as
18.2 million euros from donations and loans, the central bank
said.  Net reserves, excluding deposits by banks and the money
from the  International Monetary Fund , fell to 5.48 billion euros
from 5.54 billion euros a month earlier.  Total reserves equalled 389 percent of M1 money supply,
down from 419 percent in August. Interbank foreign-currency
trading fell more than 26 percent to 1.22 billion euros from 1.6
billion euros, bringing the nine-month volume to 12.6 billion
euros, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
