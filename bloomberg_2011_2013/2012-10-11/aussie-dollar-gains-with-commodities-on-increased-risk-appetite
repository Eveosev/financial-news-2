The Australian dollar rose against
its U.S. counterpart as global stocks and commodities gained
amid a report showing that American unemployment-benefit
applications fell, spurring risk appetite.  The so-called Aussie climbed against the majority of its 16
most-traded peers as the nation added more jobs than forecast
even as the jobless rate rose to its highest level since 2010.
The  New Zealand dollar  fell versus most of its major
counterparts after a manufacturing gauge contracted for a third
month and consumer confidence fell to a three-month low. It
gained versus the U.S. and Japanese currencies.  “A better-than-expected headline figure was the market’s
key focus, but a jump in the  unemployment rate  is the bigger
takeaway,”  Shaun Osborne , chief currency strategist at Toronto-
Dominion Bank, wrote yesterday in a note to clients. “The
Aussie’s rise on the release does not seem sustainable given the
generally softer labor trend that the report implies.”  The Australian dollar appreciated 0.3 percent to $1.0263
yesterday in  New York  after earlier gaining 0.6 percent, its
biggest increase since Sept. 27. It increased 0.5 percent to
80.38 yen.  New Zealand ’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, rose 0.1 percent
to 81.74 U.S. cents after earlier declining to 81.54 cents. It
gained 0.3 percent to 64.03 yen.  The number of people  employed  in  Australia  rose by 14,500,
the biggest increase since May, after a revised 9,100 drop the
prior month, according to the statistics bureau. The  jobless
rate  climbed to 5.4 percent, the highest since April 2010, with
the 0.3 percentage point rise the biggest since May 2009.  Economic Data  New Zealand’s  manufacturing index  rose to 48.2 from a
revised 47.4 in August, the third month it has remained below
the 50 level signaling the industry is contracting, according to
Bank of New Zealand Ltd. and Business New Zealand. An index of
 consumer confidence  fell to 110.5 this month from 111.9 in
September, ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd. said in another report.  Applications for  U.S. jobless benefits  dropped 30,000 to
339,000 in the week ended Oct. 6, the fewest since February
2008, Labor Department figures showed. Economists forecast
370,000 claims, according to a Bloomberg survey.  The kiwi has strengthened 3.5 percent this year, the
biggest increase among the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The Aussie
has fallen 1.6 percent and the greenback is down 2.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
