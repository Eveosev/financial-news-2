Belarus President  Aleksandr Lukashenko  said political parties may be allowed to gain a
greater role in parliament in the next four years, hinting at
limited reform of a system that offers no representation for
opposition groups.  “I would like this new parliament to start some
modernization of our political system,” Lukashenko said during
the final session of the outgoing parliament today in the
capital, Minsk.  The pro-government  Belaya Rus  umbrella group may be
converted into a centrist party which promotes private property
while denouncing wealth creation at the expense of ordinary
people, Lukashenko said.  The Organization for Security and Cooperation in  Europe 
said last month’s parliamentary elections in Belarus were not
free and fair after candidates aligned with Lukashenko won all
seats. Only five deputies in the former Soviet nation’s newly
elected 110-seat parliament are members of any political party,
and none of them represent the opposition. Russia said OSCE
criticism is “politicized.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
