The following is the text of
 Canada ’s international merchandise trade report for August
from  Statistics Canada .  Canada’s merchandise imports fell 3.1% and exports edged
down 0.1% in August. As a result, Canada’s trade deficit with
the world narrowed from $2.5 billion in July to $1.3 billion in
August.  Imports fell to $38.8 billion as declines occurred in every
sector, except energy products. Volumes, which fell in every
sector, were down 2.2% in August.  Exports amounted to $37.5 billion as a decrease in prices
offset an increase in volumes. The largest decline occurred in
exports of industrial goods and materials, while exports of
energy products increased after six consecutive monthly declines.  Imports from the United States fell 4.3% to $24.2 billion,
while exports rose 1.4% to $27.6 billion. Consequently, Canada’s
trade surplus with the  United States  increased from $2.0 billion
in July to $3.5 billion in August.  Exports to countries other than the United States fell 3.9%
to $9.8 billion, mainly the result of a 19.5% decline in exports
to Japan. Imports from countries other than the United States
declined 1.0% to $14.6 billion. Consequently, Canada’s trade
deficit with countries other than the United States increased
from $4.5 billion in July to $4.8 billion in August.  Imports decline as volumes down in every sector  After four consecutive monthly increases, imports of
industrial goods and materials fell 7.4% to $7.9 billion in
August. Decreases in the value of imports were widespread
throughout this sector. The largest factor was an 11.6% decline
in imports of metals and metal ores, mainly precious metals and
alloys.  Imports of machinery and equipment decreased 3.8% to $10.4
billion, as volumes and prices fell. The decline was led by
other machinery and equipment, down 5.6% to $5.0 billion.  Imports of automotive products declined 3.3% to $6.7
billion in August, as volumes (-1.9%) and prices (-1.4%) fell.
The decrease in the sector was largely the result of lower
imports of motor vehicle parts as well as trucks and other motor
vehicles.  On the strength of crude petroleum, the energy products
sector grew 6.1% to $4.1 billion, and partially offset the
decline in overall imports. Crude petroleum rose 15.4% to $2.6
billion, as a result of higher volumes and prices. Imports of
petroleum and coal products fell 5.5% to $1.2 billion, on lower
volumes.  Industrial goods and materials largest contributor to the
decline in exports  Exports of industrial goods and materials fell 6.1% to $8.8
billion, as decreases were recorded throughout the sector. The
biggest factors were exports of fertilizers and fertilizer
materials (-22.3%) as well as iron ores, concentrates and scrap
(-26.8%) on lower volumes. A 13.3% increase in exports of
precious metals and alloys partially offset the decrease.  Exports of automotive products declined 2.3% to $5.7
billion in August. Motor vehicle parts fell 6.0% to $1.5 billion,
mainly on lower volumes.  Exports of energy products rose 5.5% to $8.6 billion,
halting six consecutive monthly decreases. Exports of crude
petroleum, the main contributor, increased 9.1% to $5.5 billion,
mostly on higher prices. Also, petroleum and coal products rose
10.6%. These gains were partially offset by the fourth
consecutive monthly decline in exports of coal and other
bituminous substances.  Exports of agricultural and fishing products grew 6.5% to
$3.6 billion. The main factor was wheat exports, which rose
57.5% as volumes were up for the first time in four months.  Note to readers  Merchandise trade is one component of Canada’s
international balance of payments (BOP), which also includes
trade in services, investment income, current transfers as well
as capital and financial flows.  International merchandise trade data by country are
available on both a BOP and a customs basis for the United
States,  Japan  and the  United Kingdom . Trade data for all other
individual countries are available on a customs basis only. BOP
data are derived from customs data by making adjustments for
factors such as valuation, coverage, timing and residency. These
adjustments are made to conform to the concepts and definitions
of the Canadian System of National Accounts.  Data in this release are on a BOP basis, seasonally
adjusted and in current dollars. Constant dollars are calculated
using the Laspeyres volume formula.  For more information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal
adjustment and identifying economic trends

eng.htm) .  New aggregation structure  Statistics Canada will introduce the North American Product
Classification System (NAPCS) for merchandise import and export
statistics. The new structure will replace the classification
structures known as the summary import groups (SIG) and the
summary export groups (SEG) and the higher level aggregations
(major groups, subsectors, sectors and sections) that have been
in use for several decades.  This month’s release is the last Canadian international
merchandise trade data release based on the SIG and SEG
classification structure. As of November 8 (September reference
month), Canadian international merchandise trade data releases
will be based on NAPCS.  Revised data based on NAPCS for the reference period of
January 1988 to August 2012 will be disseminated on October 18.  Readers interested in this upcoming change can find more
detailed information on our web page dedicated to classification
( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/subjects-sujets/standard-norme/napcs -
scpan/notice-avis/napcs-scpan-02-eng.htm) consultation and
notification.  Revisions  In general, merchandise trade data are revised on an
ongoing basis for each month of the current year. Current year
revisions are reflected in both the customs and BOP based data.  The previous year’s customs data are revised with the
release of the January and February reference months as well as
on a quarterly basis. The previous two years of customs based
data are revised annually and are released in February with the
December reference month.  The previous year’s BOP based data were revised with the
release of the January, February, March and April 2012 reference
months.  Factors influencing revisions include late receipt of
import and export documentation, incorrect information on
customs forms, replacement of estimates produced for the energy
sector with actual figures, changes in classification of
merchandise based on more current information, and changes to
seasonal adjustment factors.  Revised data are available in the appropriate CANSIM tables,
free of charge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
