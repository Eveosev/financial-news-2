OAO GMK  Norilsk Nickel , the Russian
metals company at the center of a dispute between two
billionaires, tumbled in  New York  to the cheapest level versus
emerging-market mining stocks since 2010 after its conflict with
United Co. Rusal intensified.  The world’s largest producer of nickel and palladium sank
2.2 percent to a one-month low yesterday, the biggest decliner
on the  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded
Russian companies in the U.S. The gauge lost 0.5 percent to the
lowest level in two weeks, as  futures  expiring in December on
the RTS Index in Moscow slipped 0.7 percent to 146,460.  Rusal’s billionaire Chief Executive Officer  Oleg Deripaska 
has been embroiled in a conflict with Norilsk’s billionaire
shareholder  Vladimir Potanin  since 2008. The world’s biggest
aluminum producer owns 25 percent of Norilsk and has objected to
share buybacks by the company, which is supported by Potanin. A
regional court ruled in favor of Rusal on Oct. 9, declaring
Norilsk’s $4.5 billion buyback at the end of 2011 illegal.  “There is nothing positive about any shareholders
conflict,” Yuriy Vlasov, an analyst at JP Morgan Chase & Co.
who has a rating equivalent to sell on Norilsk’s Moscow-listed
shares, said by phone from Moscow yesterday. Rusal’s court
victory spurred the “market’s negative reaction,” he said.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S.-traded
exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, slid 0.9 percent
to $28.68 in New York yesterday. The RTS Volatility Index
advanced 1 percent to 28.68.  ‘Escalation’ of Conflict  Norilsk’s American depositary receipts traded at 7.8 times
estimated earnings yesterday, compared with an average multiple
of 12.9 for companies on the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Materials
Index, the biggest discount since December 2010, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The company’s  shares  traded on
Moscow’s Micex Index fell 1.7 percent to 4,822 rubles, or
$154.79.  “We consider both Norilsk and Rusal’s statements as
escalation of the shareholder conflict,” Valentina Bogomolova,
an analyst at UralSib Financial Corp. in Moscow, who recommends
investors hold Norilsk stock, wrote in a research note dated
yesterday. “Our worst case is for Rusal to win all cases and
Norilsk to have to pay it compensation.”  Norilsk’s board “had no right to approve the buyback” in
September 2011 because the plan wasn’t approved by the
government’s Commission on Foreign Investments, Rusal said in an
Oct. 9 statement. Norilsk spent $9 billion for several buybacks
of its shares and American depositary receipts in 2011 and their
value since then has fallen to $5 billion, according to Rusal.  Alcoa Forecast Cut  Bloomberg’s Russia-US index fell to 97.70, the lowest level
since Sept. 26.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S. aluminum producer,
cut its forecast for global consumption of the metal by 1
percentage point yesterday, citing slowing Chinese demand amid a
faltering global economy.  Platinum futures for January delivery dropped 1 percent to
$1,678.50 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while
palladium futures for December delivery retreated 1.3 percent to
$649.90 an ounce.  Polyus Gold International Ltd. (PGIL) ,  Russia ’s biggest producer
of the metal, fell 1.8 percent to $3.36 in New York, the weakest
since Sept. 10. The company’s stock lost 0.7 percent to 1,023.90
rubles, or $32.87, in Moscow yesterday. In  London , the  shares 
dropped 0.5 percent to 216 pence, or $3.46.  ADRs of  OAO Mechel (MTL) , Russia’s largest producer of
steelmaking coal, retreated 1.6 percent to $6.73 in the U.S.
yesterday, the lowest level since Sept. 6. The company’s Moscow-
traded  stock  fell 1.6 percent to 212.80 rubles, or $6.83.  MegaFon IPO  Rusal declined 2.3 percent to 175.85 rubles in Moscow,
leading declines on the benchmark Micex Index. Rusal lost 1.6
percent to HK$4.37 at 10:49 a.m. in Hong Kong trading.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell less than 0.1 percent.  OAO MegaFon (MFON) , Russia’s second-largest wireless carrier by
customers, sought to reassure investors a day after making an
initial public offering filing that revealed  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)  would no longer be on the share sale.  “Corporate governance is very important to  MegaFon ,”
MegaFon spokesman Petr Lidov said by e-mail yesterday. “We
decided to launch the IPO on October 9 and we are working with
banks that were ready to go ahead with us on that date.”  Oil, which together with natural gas accounted for 50
percent of Russian budget revenue in 2011, decreased 1.2 percent
to $91.25 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices
are down 7.7 percent this year. Brent for November settlement
slid 0.2 percent to $114.33 on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend,
gained 0.2 percent to $112.56 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
