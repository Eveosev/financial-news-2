Henderson Global Investors Ltd., the
London-based manager of $104 billion in assets, plans to develop
Smithfield Market in the  City of London  financial district into
offices, shops and restaurants.  The general and fish markets and other buildings will be
refurbished for use as retail space and eateries and the
historic meat market won’t be affected by the development,
Henderson said in a statement today.  Smithfield is about a third of a mile from the site Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. may develop as its new European headquarters.
The 235,000 square-foot (22,000 square-meter) development may be
valued at 160 million pounds ($257 million) after completion,
Gemma Bradley, a spokeswoman for Henderson, said yesterday.  Most of Smithfield Market’s Victorian perimeter will be
retained and new  office space  will be added in the general
market and in a storage area next to the fish market.  “These buildings have lacked sustainable long-term use,”
Geoff Harris, Henderson’s property development director, said in
today’s statement. “Significant investment is needed to
properly restore them and to deliver the commercial and civic
space that is needed to be able to make the venture a success.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
