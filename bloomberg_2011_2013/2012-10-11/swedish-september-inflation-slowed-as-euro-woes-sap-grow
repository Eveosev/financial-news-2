Swedish  inflation  slowed to the
lowest level in almost three years as the krona strengthened and
 Europe ’s debt woes sapped momentum in the largest Nordic
economy.  Consumer prices rose an annual 0.4 percent in September,
down from 0.7 percent the prior month,  Statistics Sweden  said
today. Inflation was estimated at 0.6 percent in a Bloomberg
survey of 13 economists. Prices rose a monthly 0.4 percent.
 Adjusted for mortgage  costs, prices rose an annual 0.9 percent
and 0.7 percent in the  month .  “Many companies, above all in the manufacturing sector, now
believe that prices will be lower in the period immediately
ahead,” the Riksbank said in a survey of companies published
this month. “Price competition has increased and this is
squeezing the companies’ margins and profitability.”  The krona has strengthened 5.5 percent against the euro
over the past year as investors buy Swedish assets as a haven
from the  European debt crisis . The central bank last month cut
its  main lending rate  for a third time since December to 1.25
percent to boost flagging  growth .  Sweden ’s central bank, which targets an inflation rate of 2
percent, last month also predicted it would keep rates unchanged
until the middle of next year. Economic growth in Sweden, which
sells about half of its output abroad, will slow to 1.5 percent
this year from 3.9 percent in 2011, the Riksbank predicted last
month. Sweden sells about 70 percent of its exports to Europe
where countries are cutting spending to reduce debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
