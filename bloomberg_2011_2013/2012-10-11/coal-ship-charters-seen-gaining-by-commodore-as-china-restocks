Demand strengthened for Panamax
ships hauling coal to Chinese power stations after stockpiles of
the fuel declined, boosting charter rates for the vessels,
according to Commodore Research & Consulting.  Traders booked six Panamaxes today to deliver thermal coal
to  China , more than they arranged throughout last week,  Jeffrey Landsberg , the New York-based president of Commodore, which
advises ship owners, said in an e-mailed report today. Panamaxes
normally carry about 60,000 metric tons of cargo.  Demand gained after stockpiles fell to 5.5 million tons at
the port of Qinhuangdao, below a government target of 7 million
tons, he said. The port of Qinhuangdao handles about 40 percent
of all Chinaâ€™s coastal thermal coal trade, he estimated.
Earnings for Panamaxes rose 7.6 percent to $6,716 a day, the
highest since Aug. 7, according to the London-based Baltic
Exchange today.  An increase in bookings of Capesize ships to haul iron ore
last month is poised to lengthen port delays for the vessels,
which are about twice the size of Panamaxes, Landsberg said. The
carriers are now arriving at  iron ore  loading ports, which is
causing  congestion  to increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
