A Seoul court granted a request by
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  to delay a sales ban imposed on some iPhones and
iPads after an August ruling that the U.S. company infringed on
 Samsung (005930)  Electronics Co.’s patents.  The Seoul Central District Court last month accepted
Apple’s request to stay the  South Korea  sales ban until after
the company’s appeals of the Aug. 24 ruling conclude, Kim Mun
Sung, a spokesman for the court, said by phone today.  The court found in August that Apple and Samsung infringed
on each other’s patents, and ordered the companies to stop
selling some smartphones and tablet computers in South Korea and
pay damages. Apple was ordered to stop selling the iPhone 3GS,
iPhone 4, iPad 1 and iPad 2.  Samsung hadn’t sought to stay a sales ban on some of its
Galaxy products under the Aug. 24 ruling, Kim said. The stay was
reported earlier by Yonhap News.  Steve Park , a Seoul-based spokesman for Apple, declined to
comment. Nam Ki Yung, a Seoul-based spokesman for Samsung, said
the company didn’t immediately have a comment on the court’s
decision and whether it would seek a similar stay.  Apple and Samsung, the two largest smartphone sellers, are
battling over a device market estimated by Bloomberg Industries
to be worth $219 billion last year.  The companies, which also do business with each other, are
locked in patent disputes on four continents. Apple won a jury
verdict in  San Jose , California in August that Samsung copied
the iPhone and iPad, and was awarded more than $1 billion in
damages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
