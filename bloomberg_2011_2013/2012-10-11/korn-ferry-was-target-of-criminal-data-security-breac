Korn/Ferry International (KFY) , the
executive-recruiting firm, said it was the target of a criminal
security breach.  The company worked with  law enforcement  and a digital-risk-
management firm to investigate and contain the breach, it said
today in a statement. The databases that were impacted don’t
typically hold credit cards, Social Security numbers or health
information, and Korn/Ferry said it has no knowledge of any
information that was “compromised.”  The company didn’t say when the attack happened, or when it
was discovered.  “Korn/Ferry is deeply committed to maintaining the
security of its data, and will continue to work diligently
toward achieving this objective,” the Los Angeles-based firm
said in the statement.  The investigation so far shows that the intrusion was a
sophisticated kind of attack called an “advanced persistent
threat,” typical of state-sponsored cybercriminals, the company
said.  Korn/Ferry, which has almost 80 offices in 40 countries,
according to its website, rose 0.3 percent to $14.04 at the
close in  New York . The stock has dropped 18 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
