Sweden  called on operators of
nuclear reactors to take steps to improve plant safety,
Environment Minister Lena Ek said, after environmental activists
entered restricted areas at two atomic facilities.  “This is a very serious situation,” the minister said in
a video posted on the  government’s website  yesterday. Ek met
earlier with the country’s radiation safety authority and with
Vattenfall AB and  EON AG (EOAN) , two of Sweden’s plant operators.  “I have furthermore called for a new meeting in one month,
when I expect an analysis of exactly what happened, what has
been invested, as well as an action plan,” Ek said.  About 60 activists from Greenpeace, the environmental
lobbying group, entered the Forsmark and Ringhals nuclear
plants, the regulator said on Oct. 9 on its website.  Sweden’s nuclear regulator plans to investigate the matter
further, Mats Persson, director general of the radiation safety
authority, said in an e-mailed statement. Vattenfall, EON and
 Fortum Oyj (FUM1V)  will be asked for further information, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
