Two sugar mills in South  Africa  were
forced to suspend production due to the third week of a
truckers’ strike just as the harvest season draws to a close.  TSB Sugar, a wholly owned subsidiary of investment company
 Remgro Ltd. (REM) , said two mills in Mpumalanga province have been
halted, according to an e-mailed statement.  Illovo Sugar Ltd. (ILV) ,
Africa’s biggest producer of the commodity, said cane deliveries
to its mills are affected.  Tongaat Hulett Ltd. (TON) , another
producer, said its mills have also been disrupted by erratic
supplies.  “The strike action has affected inbound deliveries of
sugar cane, resulting in the provisional termination of
production processes at the two mills,” TSB Sugar, based in
Malelane, said today.  About 20,000 drivers started a strike on Sept. 24 to demand
wage increases of at least 10 percent for 2013 and 2014.
Employers want a three-year agreement with a 10 percent increase
for 2013 and pay rises of less than 10 percent for the following
two years, according to the Road Freight Employers Association.  Sugar cane farmers, based mainly in the coastal KwaZulu-
Natal and inland Mpumalanga provinces, have been “extensively
affected,” Tim Murray, chairman of the 31,000-member
 Canegrowers  association, which represents sugar farmers, said by
phone yesterday. “We are still recovering from a drought in
2011,” he said from his farm near New Hanover in KwaZulu-Natal.  Farmers had  16 million metric tons  of cane crushed in 2011
compared with 19.2 million tons in 2009, according to data from
the  South African Sugar Association , an industry supplier. A
crop of 18.2 million tons of cane is expected this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
