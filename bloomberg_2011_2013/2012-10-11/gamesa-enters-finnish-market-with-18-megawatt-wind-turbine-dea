Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA (GAM) ,  Spain ’s
biggest wind-turbine maker, expanded into the Finnish market by
agreeing to supply 18 megawatts of machines to  TuuliWatti Oy .  Gamesa will install four turbines at the Simo wind farm in
northern  Finland , the Zamudio-based manufacturer said today in a
 statement , without disclosing terms. The accord with TuuliWatti,
a venture between Finland’s St1 Oy and S-Group, includes an
option for a further 117 megawatts at four sites.  Finland, while lagging behind neighboring Sweden and Norway
in wind power, approved an incentive program in March 2011 aimed
at raising capacity more than 10-fold by 2020. That’s lured
companies such as Gamesa, which has looked abroad for expansion
after Spain shut off aid for renewable power.  The Simo turbines are due to begin operating late next
year. The wind farm is part of TuuliWatti’s 400 million-euro
($515 million) investment plan, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
