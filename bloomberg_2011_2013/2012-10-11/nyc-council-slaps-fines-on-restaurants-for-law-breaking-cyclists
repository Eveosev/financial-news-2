New York restaurants and messenger
companies will face $100 civil fines if they fail to equip
delivery bicyclists with helmets, lights and reflectors under
laws passed today by the  City Council .  The package of four measures, backed by Mayor  Michael Bloomberg , authorizes the Transportation Department to inspect
businesses and issue fines. Employers also will be required to
ensure that riders attend road-safety classes.  City law already imposes criminal penalties of as much as
$200 in fines and 60 days in jail on businesses that don’t
provide cyclists with safety equipment. Those laws are seldom
enforced by the police department, said Jeff Lynch, chief of
staff for Councilman James Vacca, sponsor of the measures.  “The days of the wild, wild West are now over,” Vacca
said today before the vote.  One of the bills, called Stuart’s Law, is named in memory
of  Stuart C. Gruskin , who was killed in 2009 by a commercial
cyclist riding the wrong way on a one-way street, according to
Vacca’s office.  Since 2007,  New York  has added more than 290 miles (467
kilometers) to the now more than 700-mile-long bike-lane system,
part of the Bloomberg administration’s efforts to tackle two of
the city’s most persistent problems: congested roads and ever-
widening waistlines.  The mayor is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg
News parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
