American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the insurer that counts the U.S. government as its largest
 shareholder , reached a five-year deal to sponsor New Zealand’s
rugby team, the New Zealand Herald reported.  The All Blacks’ shorts and jersey sleeves could have the
logo of New York-based AIG as soon as next month, the Herald
 reported , citing people it didn’t identify. The newspaper said
the deal will be announced later today.  Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche  is reviving a
brand that his predecessor Edward Liddy dismissed as “wounded
and disgraced” in 2009 amid a U.S. bailout that swelled in
value to $182.3 billion and was repaid last month. Benmosche is
scheduled to ring the opening bell at the  New York  Stock
Exchange next week as the insurer shows off a redesigned logo.
AIG reached a deal for the logo to appear on the USA Rugby
team’s jerseys.  “Rugby is one of the fastest-growing sports in the world
and in 2016, will be featured in the summer  Olympic Games ,”
Benmosche said in a statement announcing the USA Rugby
sponsorship. “We look forward to supporting and encouraging
youth involvement and achievement in this dynamic sport.”  Jim Ankner, an AIG spokesman, declined to comment on the
Herald’s report. The New Zealand Rugby Union didn’t respond to
an e-mail seeking comment.  AIG had sponsored  Manchester United , the English soccer
team that has won 19 national championships. Aon Plc, the
world’s largest insurance broker, has its emblem on the jersey
after replacing AIG in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
