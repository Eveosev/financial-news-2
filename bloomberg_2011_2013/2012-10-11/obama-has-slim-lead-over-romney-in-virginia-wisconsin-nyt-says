President  Barack Obama  holds a slim
lead over Republican challenger  Mitt Romney  in Virginia and
Wisconsin, and is tied in Colorado, according to the latest
Quinnipiac University poll, the  New York  Times reported.  Obama maintained his lead over Romney on questions of
trustworthiness and honesty in Virginia and Wisconsin, the poll,
which includes support from the New York Times and CBS News,
showed.  A total of 4,499 adults were interviewed in the three swing
states after the first televised debate between the two men. The
poll showed no sharp movements in support for either man after
the deb ate and release of economic data on Oct. 5.  The president received backing on economic policy although
those questioned increased their perception of Romey’s
leadership skills, the NYT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
