Cantor Fitzgerald LP, the investment
bank planning to add 800 people, hired four employees from
Sterne Agee & Leach Inc. to strengthen its municipal bond unit
in debt capital markets.  Jim Dolan, previously a senior managing director of
municipal bonds at Sterne Agee, will head the municipal
division, New York-based Cantor said today in an e-mailed
statement. John Donovan will be a managing director of trading
and underwriting, and Susan Marron joins as a senior vice
president of sales. Dennis DiCicco will be a vice president of
institutional sales.  Cantor is “confident that their extensive experience and
strong industry relationships will make an immediate and
positive contribution,” Shawn Matthews, chief executive officer
of Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., said in the statement.  Howard Lutnick, chairman and CEO of the parent company, is
pushing ahead with plans to expand in capital markets and grow
outside the U.S. as a decline in trading pressures profit at the
brokerage unit. Moody’s Investors Service cut Cantor’s debt to
junk this month, saying the expansion failed to boost income
enough and compensation costs have been “stubbornly high.”  The downgrade won’t have an impact on Cantor’s hiring
strategy, Matthews said today in a phone interview.  “We’re clearly looking to build our franchise,” he said.
“We’ve always told people that when times are tough -- and the
markets are pretty difficult right now -- we would always make
less money. When times are good, we’ll make more.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
