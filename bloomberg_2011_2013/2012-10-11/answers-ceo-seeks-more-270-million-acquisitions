Answers Corp., which lost a bid to
buy About.com from the  New York Times Co. (NYT)  in August, has other
plans to grow through acquisitions, Chief Executive Officer
David Karandish said.  The question-and-answer website will try for deals similar
in scope to About.com before  IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI)  counterbid and
won, Karandish said in an interview yesterday at Bloomberg’s
headquarters in New York. Answers had offered $270 million for
About.com, a person with knowledge of the matter said at the
time, while IAC had offered $300 million.  “We’re looking at some things of that size,” Karandish
said. He’s looking for companies that will build out content,
expand the user base or provide expertise with direct social
media advertising sales, he said.  Answers now faces stiffer competition from IAC’s Ask.com,
which is combining answers from About.com into its search
results, along with information from Wikipedia, in order to
generate more advertising income. Answers, which also  owns 
ResellerRatings, would have been able to provide deeper context
with content from About.com, Karandish said.  Answers was earlier known as AFCV Holdings LLC, a portfolio
company of private equity firm Summit Partners, which had
 acquired  Answers in 2011 for $127 million and took its name.  The failed attempt to acquire About.com raised St. Louis-
based Answers’ profile, Karandish said. Answers has 180 million
registered users.  “There was a lot of inbound buy and sell interest out of
the process,” Karandish said. “We weren’t very well known. We
were in the chrysalis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
