Pratt & Whitney, building an engine
for Airbus SAS’s A320neo, said orders for the new  geared turbo-
fan  powerplant may double as airlines seek more fuel-efficient
aircraft.  Orders for the engine could “easily” rise to 6,000 from
3,000, President David Hess said in an interview in Nagoya,
 Japan , on Oct. 9. He didn’t give a timeframe.  Pratt intends to eventually improve the engine’s fuel-
efficiency by as much as 30 percent compared with today’s
powerplants, he said. Demand for the A320neo and  Boeing Co. (BA)  737
Max jets surged as carriers seek new planes to curb fuel costs
that have jumped 43 percent in the past two years.  “We’ll keep increasing the efficiency of the engine by
incremental improvements,” Hess said.  The company, a unit of  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) , has won
orders for variations of the new engine from Airbus,  Bombardier
Inc. (BBD/B) , Russia’s Irkut Corp. and  Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp.   Mitsubishi Aircraft, a unit of  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
Ltd. (7011) , may be able to sell 1,500 passenger jets, President Hideo Egawa told reporters at an airshow in Nagoya this week. That
compares with an initial target of 1,000 Mitsubishi Regional Jet
sales over the lifetime of the program.  Pratt can make a profit on the turbo-fan engine with the
current 3,000 orders, Hess said. The V2500 engine, which the
company builds under  IAE International Aero Engines AG  with two
other partners, has sold about 5,000 units, he said.  The A320neo has become the fastest-selling plane in
aviation history as Airbus won more than 1,400 orders for the
jet since it was introduced at the end of 2010. Boeing has more
than 700 orders for its 737 Max.  To contact the reporters on this story:
