The Treasury’s $13 billion sale of
30-year bonds may draw a  yield  of 2.880 percent, according to
the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of eight of the
Federal Reserve’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in August 2042, yielded 2.880
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York
time. The yield at the Sept. 13 long-bond auction was 2.896
percent. The record-low auction yield was 2.580 percent in July.  The September offering’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
2.68, versus with an average of 2.65 at the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 38.7 percent of the bonds at the
September sale, compared with 36.7 percent at the August
auction. The average for the past 10 offerings is 33.2 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 12.4 percent of
the securities at last month’s sale, less than the average 15.1
percent at the past 10 auctions.  Thirty-year bonds have returned 2.5 percent this year,
compared with a 2 percent gain in the broader U.S. Treasuries
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The auction is the last of three Treasury note and bond
offerings this week totaling $66 billion. The U.S. sold $21
billion of  10-year debt  yesterday at a yield of 1.7 percent and
auctioned $32 billion of three-year notes on Sept. 11 at a yield
of 0.346 percent.  The sales will raise $26.7 billion of new cash as maturing
securities held by the public total $39.3 billion, according to
the Treasury.  Primary dealers trade government securities with the
central bank and are obliged to participate in Treasury sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
