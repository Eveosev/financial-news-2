Colombian Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas said he wants to include a capital gains tax on local
retail investors in the stock market as part of tax legislation
currently under debate in Congress.  “As it stands the exemptions are too broad, we don’t need
such a generalized exemption from the capital gains taxes,”
Cardenas said in an interview with Javeriana Radio today.  Cardenas said he will include a tax on profits above 1
billion pesos ($556,500) for local investors and 5 billion pesos
for “professional traders.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
