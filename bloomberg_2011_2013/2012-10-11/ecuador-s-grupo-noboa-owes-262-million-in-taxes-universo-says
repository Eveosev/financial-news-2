Ecuador’s Grupo Noboa SA, the
country’s largest banana exporter, owes $262 million in unpaid
taxes, El Universo reported, citing Carlos Marx Carrasco,
director of the country’s tax agency.  SRI, as the agency is known, audited 156 of the group’s
companies, including Exportadora Bananera Noboa SA, and said 30
were avoiding taxes, the Guayaquil, Ecuador-based  newspaper
 said. The company’s lawyers are seeking to block government
attempts to auction property seized by agency, Universo said.  Telephone calls to Noboa’s press office in Guayaquil today
went unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
