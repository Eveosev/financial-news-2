Shutterstock Inc. (SSTK) , an online
marketplace for digital images, surged in its first trading day
after raising $76.5 million in an initial public offering that
sold above the proposed price range.  The shares, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under
the symbol SSTK,  advanced  27 percent to close at $21.66.
Shutterstock sold 4.5 million shares at $17 apiece, the New
York-based company said today in a statement. The IPO exceeded
the proposed range of $13 to $15, giving the company a market
value of $558.3 million.  Shutterstock, which sells access to a cache of more than 20
million licensed photos, illustrations and videos, is the city’s
first technology IPO since MediaMind Technologies Inc. went
public in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Shutterstock is getting a boost from increased interest in photo
databases since  Carlyle Group LP (CG)  agreed in August to buy photo
archive Getty Images in a deal valued at $3.3 billion.  “It’s hard to imagine that it’s gotten this big,”
Shutterstock Chief Executive Officer Jon Oringer said in an
interview. “I’ve had lots of opportunities to do whatever I
want to do at Shutterstock, and now we have more flexibility to
grow.”  Oringer said he has rebuffed acquisition offers and wants
to retain control of the company, which he founded in 2003 with
30,000 of his own photographs.  Shutterstock sells images to more than 550,000 customers in
more than 150 countries for use on websites as well as for
digital or printed marketing materials. Net income rose 15
percent to $21.9 million last year, while revenue increased 45
percent to $120.3 million.  ‘Good Property’  “Shutterstock is a good property,” Francis Gaskins,
president of IPOdesktop.com in Marina Del Rey,  California , said
in an interview. “They have a large user base, recurring cash
flow and increasing revenue. It really depends on the quarterly
earnings now.”  After the IPO, Oringer will own about 57 percent of
outstanding common stock, while Insight Venture Partners will
hold about a 21 percent stake, according to a regulatory filing.  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , and  Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) 
were the lead underwriters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
