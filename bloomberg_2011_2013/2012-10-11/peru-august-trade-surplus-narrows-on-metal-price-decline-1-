Peru’s trade surplus narrowed in
August as copper, gold and coffee prices declined and imports
rose to a record.  The country had a  trade  surplus of $48 million in August,
compared with a $1.27 billion surplus a year earlier and a
revised $16 million surplus the previous month, the country’s
statistics agency said in an e-mailed report today.  Exports dropped 20 percent to $3.71 billion from the same
month of 2011, the steepest decline this year, the agency said.
Imports rose 9.3 percent to $3.66 billion, led by capital goods
for the mining and energy industry, fuel, televisions and cars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
