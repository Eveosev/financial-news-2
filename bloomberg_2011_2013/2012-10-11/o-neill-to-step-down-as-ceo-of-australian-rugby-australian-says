John O’Neill resigned as chief
executive officer of the Australian Rugby Union, the Australian
newspaper reported, without saying where it got the information.  O’Neill, who has run rugby in  Australia  for 14 of the past
17 years, had planned to retire at the end of next season and is
said to have decided to step down early, the newspaper said.  The Australian Rugby Union said it will hold a news
conference in Sydney at 11 a.m. local time where O’Neill and ARU
Chairman Michael Hawker will be in attendance.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
