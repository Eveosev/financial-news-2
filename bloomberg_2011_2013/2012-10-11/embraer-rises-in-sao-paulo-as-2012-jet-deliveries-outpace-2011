Embraer SA (EMBR3) , the world’s fourth-
largest planemaker, rose to a three-week high after reporting a
5.7 percent increase in jet deliveries this year and a $12.4
billion backlog of orders.  Shares gained 1.4 percent to 14.15 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the highest since Sept. 17. The benchmark
Bovespa index gained 1.2 percent.  This year through September, deliveries totaled 129
aircraft, seven more than during the same period in 2011,
Embraer said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The backlog of
firm orders totaled $12.4 billion on Sept. 30, the Sao Jose dos
Campos, Brazil-based company said.  Embraer probably benefited from about $800 million of
orders, “which is still not enough to stabilize the backlog,
but is significantly better than the second quarter in which
order intake was close to zero,” Banco Santander Brasil SA
analysts including Pedro Balcao Reis wrote in a note to clients.  The Santander analysts expect the company to report revenue
of $1.4 billion in the third quarter,  in line  with last year’s
figures, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Embraer is
scheduled to report quarterly results Oct. 23.  Embraer has fallen 14 percent from this year’s high on
April 19, while the Bovespa slid 5.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
