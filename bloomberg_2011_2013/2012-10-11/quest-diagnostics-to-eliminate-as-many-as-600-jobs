Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX) , the biggest
U.S. operator of medical labs, said it will eliminate as many as
600 management positions as the company restructures into two
business groups.  Trimming the workforce will save about $65 million, the
Madison, New Jersey-based company said in a statement today.
Quest has about 42,000 employees.  One group, dubbed diagnostic information services, “will
include the vast majority of the company’s revenues” and
replace the physician services, hospital services and cancer
diagnostics businesses, Quest said. The unit will be responsible
for developing and delivering tests, information and services.
The diagnostic solutions group will make test kits, as well as
provide insurance and employer testing services, said Gary Samuels, a company spokesman, in a phone interview.  The structural changes are scheduled to take effect by
January, with the positions being eliminated by the end of 2013,
Quest said.  Quest rose less than 1 percent to $63.95 at 10:01 a.m.  New
York  time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
