U.K. 10-year break-even rates
widened the most in almost a month on increased demand for
inflation-linked gilts as the nation sold 1.5 billion pounds
($2.4 billion) of the securities due in 2024.  The pound strengthened for a second day against the dollar.
Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee member  Martin Weale 
said the U.K. could face a triple-dip recession, the  Daily Mail 
reported, citing an interview. A consultation on potential
changes to the formula used to calculate Britain’s retail-price
index has led to market concern about the impact on inflation-
linked gilts, Robert Stheeman, chief executive officer of the
U.K.’s Debt Management Office, said on Sept. 26.  “It was a strong auction,” said  Sam Hill , a fixed-income
strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in London. The result “was a
relief as with the RPI methodology change issue hanging over the
market there was a chance participation could have suffered.”  The U.K.  10-year break-even  rate, a gauge of market
inflation expectations derived from the yield difference between
regular and index-linked bonds, was 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, higher at 2.60 percent as of 4:18 p.m.  London 
time, the biggest increase since Sept. 14. It fell to 2.39
percent on Oct. 3, the lowest level since Aug. 7.  The U.K. sold the 2024 inflation-linked gilts at an average
real yield of minus 0.441 percent. Investors bid for 2.56 times
the securities allotted. The nation has now sold 100.97 billion
pounds of debt since April 1, according to the DMO. That
represents 61.4 percent of its 2012-2013 fiscal year target of
164.4 billion pounds, according to data provided by the DMO.  ‘Sufficient Evidence’  While index-linked government debt is tied to retail
prices, the Bank of England sets its benchmark  interest rate 
based on consumer-price inflation, which has been lower than
retail-price inflation on average for the past two decades. The
independent Consumer Prices Advisory Committee said on Sept. 18
there is “sufficient evidence to consider change” to inflation
calculations and it’s examining “any unjustifiable formula
effect gap” between the two measures.  Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Michael Amey said on
Sept. 26 that Britain’s review of its retail-price index
calculations could threaten the gilt market’s reputation as a
haven for investors.  Conventional gilts declined after Standard & Poor’s
yesterday cut  Spain ’s sovereign-debt rating to one level above
non-investment grade, citing mounting economic and political
risks as the Spanish government considers a second bailout.  Gilt Yield  The 10-year gilt yield was two basis points higher at 1.79
percent. The 1.75 percent bond due September 2022 fell 0.185, or
1.85 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount to 99.67.  Gilts returned 2.9 percent this year through yesterday, as
investors bought the securities as a refuge from  Europe ’s debt
crisis, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bonds gained 3.1 percent and U.S. Treasuries rose 2.1 percent.  Signs of recovery in the U.K. remain elusive,  Bank of
England  policy maker Weale said in an interview with the Daily
Mail, according to the newspaper. An increase in the central
bank’s asset-purchase program, a policy known as quantitative
easing, could push inflation higher, he said.  The Bank of England refrained from boosting its bond-buying
 target  from 375 billion pounds at a policy meeting on Oct. 4.
The central bank last increased its target in July, adding 50
billion pounds to the program, which is scheduled to end in
November. Minutes of the meeting will be released on Oct. 17.  Sterling Gains  Sterling gained 0.1 percent to $1.6028, after dropping to
$1.5977 yesterday, matching the lowest since Sept. 10. The pound
weakened 0.3 percent to 80.67 pence per euro. It gained 0.6
percent in the past two days after reaching 81 pence on Oct. 9,
the weakest level since Sept. 17.  The pound has strengthened 0.3 percent in the past six
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes,
which track 10 developed-market currencies. The euro fell 2.1
percent and the dollar weakened 0.6 percent.  New York-based S&P said in a statement yesterday it lowered
Spain’s credit ranking two levels to BBB- from BBB+. The ratings
company maintained a negative outlook to the nation’s long-term
rating, that it said “reflects our view of the significant
risks to Spain’s economic growth and budgetary performance, and
the lack of a clear direction in euro-zone policy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
