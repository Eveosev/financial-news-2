Japanese  shares  fell, with the
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  dropping to an 11-week low, after the
nation’s machinery orders declined the first time in three
months, renewing concern about global demand.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , Japan’s biggest maker of factory robotics,
fell 2.7 percent.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (5202) , which gets 41 percent
of sales in Europe, slid 1.7 percent after Spain’s debt rating
was cut by Standard & Poor’s. Tokai Rika Co., a parts supplier
to Toyota Motor Corp., plunged 9.6 percent after the world’s
biggest automaker by market value recalled 7.4 million vehicles.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.6 percent to 8,546.78
at 3 p.m. in Tokyo, the lowest close since July 26. The broader
 Topix (TPX)  Index declined 0.4 percent to 713.95, with two stocks
retreating for each that rose. Shares pared losses after
International Monetary Fund Managing Director  Christine Lagarde 
said the global lender will spare no effort to help Greece.  “You can tell from the machine orders that overseas demand
is bad as Japan-China relations worsen and  China’s economy 
slows,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , chief strategist at Toyota Asset
Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of about 1.87
trillion yen ($24 billion). “The situation is pretty bleak and
investors won’t be willing to buy for a while.”  The Topix slid 2 percent this year as a slowdown in the
global economy boosted demand for the yen as a haven and as a
territorial dispute with China saw Japanese production there
disrupted, weighing on earnings. Policy makers in Asia, the U.S.
and Europe have introduced a series of stimulus measures to
support growth.  Machinery Orders  Shares on the Topix trade at about 0.85 times book value,
compared with 2.22 for the  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index and 1.49
times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. A number lower than one
means a company can be bought for less than the value of its
assets.  Stocks dropped after a government report today showed
Japan’s machinery orders fell 3.3 percent in August after rising
4.6 percent in July. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected
a 2.3 percent decline.  Fanuc declined 2.7 percent to 12,120 yen. Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd., a heavy-machinery maker, lost 2 percent to 339
yen.  Tokai Rika plunged 9.6 percent to 905 yen after Toyota
recalled about 7.43 million vehicles for a faulty window switch.
The parts supplier counts Toyota as its largest customer. A
gauge of transportation equipment companies on the Topix slid 1
percent.  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  were little changed today. The index
declined 0.6 percent in New York yesterday at the opening of an
earnings season expected to show that profits and sales of  S&P
500  listed companies fell in unison for the first time in three
years, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Spain Rating  Spain’s debt rating was lowered two levels to BBB- from
BBB+, S&P said yesterday, citing mounting economic and political
risks. The rating company assigned a negative outlook on the
nation’s debt.  Exporters to Europe fell, with Nippon Sheet Glass dropping
1.7 percent to 58 yen.  Makita Corp. (6586) , a maker of power tools that
depends on the region for 42 percent of its sales, lost 0.6
percent to 2,963 yen.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 7.1 percent
to 19.38, indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.6 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Volume on the
Nikkei 225 was 9.7 percent above the 30-day average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
