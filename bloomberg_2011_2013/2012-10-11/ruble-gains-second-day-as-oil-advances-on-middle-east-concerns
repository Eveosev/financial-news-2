The ruble advanced for a second day
as oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner, rose on concern escalating
tensions between Syria and Turkey may disrupt supplies from the
 Middle East .  The ruble gained 0.3 percent to 31.0075 against the dollar
at 7 p.m. in Moscow. The Russian currency slid 0.2 percent
versus the euro to 40.2200, leaving it little changed against
the central bank’s euro-dollar target basket at 35.1531.  Crude oil gained as much as 1.9 percent to $92.94 a barrel
in New York after Turkey seized cargo on a Syrian passenger
plane and unconfirmed media reports said weapons and military
communications gear had been discovered. Oil and gas account for
about 50 percent of Russia’s government revenue. U.S.
applications for jobless benefits dropped 30,000 to 339,000 in
the week ended Oct. 6, the fewest since February 2008, Labor
Department figures showed today.  Climbing  oil prices  “offer strong support to the national
currency,” Alexei Egorov, an analyst with Moscow-based OAO
Nomos Bank, said by e-mail. “With good data from the U.S. on
first-time claims for  unemployment benefits  we should see
further appreciation.”  The ruble lost as much as 0.4 percent earlier after
 Standard & Poor’s  downgrade of Spain’s debt rating. S&P cited
mounting economic and political risks for the downgrade to one
level above junk, as Spain’s government considers requesting a
sovereign bailout.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.5075 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.5835 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell four basis points 187, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
