U.S. stocks pared gains as a slump
in Apple Inc. dragged down technology shares, helping to trim an
earlier market rally after American jobless claims slid to a
four-year low.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent to
1,434.05 at 1:55 p.m. New York time, after climbing as much as
0.8 percent. Apple dropped 1.5 percent, erasing an earlier rally
of as much as 1 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
