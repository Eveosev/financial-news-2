Peru ’s sol weakened for the first
time this month after the central bank stepped up dollar
purchases to offset sales by companies looking for local
currency to meet a tax deadline.  The sol fell 0.1 percent to 2.5870 per  U.S. dollar  at the
close of trading, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.
The central bank said it bought $80 million in the spot market
today and paid an average 2.5870 per dollar, after buying $80
million yesterday.  Policy makers have increased daily purchases from $20
million last week as dollar sales increase before a monthly
period for tax payments begins Oct. 12.  “The central bank will keep intervening as it seeks to
contain the volatility the market may experience during this
period,” said Hedmond Rios, an economist at Celfin Capital in
Santiago.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.57 percent, according to Bloomberg
prices. The bond’s price rose 0.32 cent to 148.25 cents per
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
