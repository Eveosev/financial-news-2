The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars rose for the fourth day to the highest in more
than a week, according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 27 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:13 a.m. in
 London , from minus 25 yesterday according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The cost is the highest since Oct. 1.  The one-year basis swap was 26.5 basis points, or 0.265
percentage point, below Euribor from minus 25.5 yesterday.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another held near the lowest since August 2007. The
difference between Euribor and overnight index swaps, known as
the Euribor-OIS spread, was 12.7 basis points from 12.6
yesterday.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.092
percent yesterday from 0.091 the day before. The  volume  of
overnight lending as measured by the EBF in Brussels fell to
22.6 billion euros ($29 billion) of transactions yesterday, the
lowest since Oct. 3, from 23.7 billion euros the day before.  The Eonia swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing
costs over the next three months, rose to 9.5 basis points from
8.6 yesterday.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the European Central Bank
yesterday, placing 243 billion euros with the Frankfurt-based
central bank from 284 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
