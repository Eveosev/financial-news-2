Taiwan dollar  forwards touched a
one-week low as a cut in Spain’s debt rating by  Standard &
Poor’s  sapped investor appetite for emerging-market assets.
Government bonds rose after South Korea lowered  interest rates .  Spanish credit was reduced two notches to one level above
junk of BBB- from BBB+, S&P said yesterday, citing mounting
economic and political risks and assigning a negative outlook.
The Bank of Korea cut borrowing costs for a second time this
year to 2.75 percent today, a decision predicted by 13 of 16
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  “Spain got downgraded again, but investors aren’t
surprised anymore, so we’re seeing limited market reaction,”
said George Pu, a bond trader at Sinopac Securities Corp. in
Taipei. “ South Korea ’s rate cut shows Asia’s economy is still
in a pretty bad shape and policy makers are taking action to
revive growth.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed at
NT$29.28 against the greenback as of 4:26 p.m. in Taipei and
reached NT$29.342 earlier, the weakest level since Oct. 4,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the spot market, the
Taiwan dollar slipped 0.1 percent to NT$29.43, prices from
Taipei Forex Inc. show.  One-month implied volatility for the island’s currency, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, was
little changed at 3.8 percent.  Taiwan and South Korea’s economies are closely related
because they are both export-oriented and focus on technology
industries such as semiconductor chips and smartphones. The
island’s monetary authority kept its discount rate for 10-day
loans at 1.875 percent in September. The next meeting is
scheduled for December.  Ten-year yields on Taiwan’s  government bonds  due September
2022 fell to 1.135 percent from 1.139 percent yesterday,
according to Gretai Securities Market. Benchmark rates reached
an all-time low of 1.125 percent on July 26.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.387 percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Centre shows.  To contact the reporters on this story:
