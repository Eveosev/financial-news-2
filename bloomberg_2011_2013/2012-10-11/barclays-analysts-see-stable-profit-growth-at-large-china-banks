China â€™s largest  banks  will report
relatively stable profit growth for the third quarter because
they suffered less from interest rate cuts than their smaller
rivals, analysts at Barclays Plc said.  The biggest lenders may post net income growth of 11
percent, compared with 13 percent in the second quarter, Hong
Kong-based analysts led by May Yan wrote in a note published
today. Smaller so-called joint-stock banks may see net income
growth slow more steeply, to 12 percent from 24 percent, the
analysts wrote.  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. , the third-largest by
market value, and  China Merchants Bank Co. (3968)  may outperform with
growth of 15 percent, she wrote.  Net interest margins, which measure lending profitability,
have narrowed at Chinese lenders and credit costs have risen
since the government cut  interest rates  and changed the way
banks price loans and deposits in the third quarter.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
