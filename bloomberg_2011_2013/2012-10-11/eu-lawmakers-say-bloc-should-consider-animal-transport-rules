The European Union should do more to
improve transport conditions for livestock by adopting journey
time limits or supporting more local slaughter facilities, a
European Parliament committee said.  The EU should consider a measure that would bar
transporting live animals on journeys longer than eight hours,
while allowing for “geographical and science-based exceptions
for certain species,” according to a  statement  e-mailed today
by the EU Parliament’s Agriculture and Rural Development
committee. Space allowances and water conditions during
transportation also should be considered, it said.  Enforcement of existing animal welfare legislation and
penalties for rule breakers should be streamlined across member
states, and more on-the-spot inspections should be carried out,
the committee said. Transportation of pigs within the EU rose 70
percent from 2005 to 2009, and about one-third of the journeys
are longer than eight hours, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
