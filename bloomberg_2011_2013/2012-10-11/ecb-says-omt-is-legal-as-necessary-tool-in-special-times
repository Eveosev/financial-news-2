The  European Central Bank  said its
new bond purchasing program is legal under its founding rules as
it helps achieve the primary mandate of ensuring  price stability 
and it will not be used to print money.  Outright Monetary Transactions “are a non-standard, but
necessary, monetary policy instrument in the current exceptional
circumstances in financial markets,” the ECB said in an article
in its monthly report published today examining the legality of
the new plan.  “The use of outright purchases of bonds as a monetary
policy tool is expressly provided for in Article 18.1 of the
Statute” of the European System of Central Banks, the ECB said.  The ECB has come under fire in  Germany , with the Bundesbank
saying the bond plan compromises the central bank’s independence
and comes close to violating a ban on the central bank financing
governments.  The ECB said it will “under no circumstances” allow OMTs
to be used to print money and thereby not breaching Article 123
of its founding treaty, which prohibits the purchase of
 government bonds  in the primary market.  The ECB will only purchase government bonds in the
secondary market, if governments sign up to strict
conditionality. The tool  “will only be used to the extent
necessary to achieve the objective of maintaining price
stability,” it said in today’s report.  Officials have devised “specific operational modalities”
to ensure the OMT does not interfere with the objectives of the
monetary financing prohibition, the ECB said.  “A major concern has been the need to ensure that this
monetary policy instrument could not ultimately weaken fiscal
discipline,” according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
