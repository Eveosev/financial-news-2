Singapore would be a natural setting
for a water derivatives exchange and it’s in country’s interest
to set one up, the  Straits Times  reported, citing carbon-trading
pioneer Richard Sandor.  Singapore could become the first water exchange in the
world, supported by its water services industry expertise and
solid regulations, the Straits Times quoted Sandor as saying.
Having a water exchange would encourage more efficient use of
the resource, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
