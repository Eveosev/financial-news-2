Italian bonds rose for the first
time in four days after investor demand for the nation’s
securities increased at a sale of three-year notes, easing
concern that a Spanish downgrade would deepen the debt crisis.  The advance pushed  10-year yields  down from a two-week
high. Italy sold 3.75 billion euros ($4.8 billion) of its July
2015 securities, the maximum sales target, to yield 2.86
percent. Investors bid for 1.67 times the amount sold, up from
1.49 times at a sale on Sept. 13.  Spain ’s 10-year bonds advanced
even after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the nation’s credit ranking two
levels to BBB- yesterday, and gave it a negative outlook. German
10-year yields reversed gains after touching a one-week low.  “The auctions were pretty good, they issued at the top end
of the range and that had a small positive effect,” said Mohit Kumar, head of European fixed-income strategy at Deutsche Bank
AG in  London . “The market is still waiting for the next step,
which is for Spain to ask for a bailout.”  Italy’s 10-year yield fell nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 5.02 percent at 4:30 p.m. London time. The
5.5 percent bond due November 2022 rose 0.73, or 7.30 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 104.265.  Italy also sold a total of 2.25 billion euros of bonds due
in 2016, 2018 and 2025 to yield 3.42 percent, 4.06 percent and
5.24 percent, respectively. The nation, which is due to pay 18
billion euros in redemptions on Oct. 15, auctioned 11 billion
euros of bills yesterday.  Gross Issuance  Italy’s 10-year yield remains almost 1 percentage point
above its average for the past decade. Still, its sovereign
debt, currently about 120 percent of gross domestic product, is
sustainable at current yields, debt agency head Maria Cannata
said in an interview in  Rome  two days ago. Italy was forced to
revise up its gross issuance for this year by about 20 billion
euros, Cannata said.  Spain’s 10-year yield dropped four basis points to 5.76
percent after earlier climbing to 5.93 percent, the most since
Oct. 1. Two-year note yields also fell four basis points, to
3.23 percent.  S&P’s downgrade of Spain comes after the nation announced a
fifth austerity package in less than a year and published
details about stress tests of its banks. Concern that the nation
would be unable to pay its debts have grown since the government
requested as much as 100 billion euros in European Union aid in
June to shore up its lenders and amid signals that the
government won’t be able to meet its deficit target.  Bailout Decision  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is weighing a second bailout
amid a deepening recession, stalling on a decision about whether
to request  European Central Bank  and EU bond purchases to lower
borrowing costs. He has called for more detail on what would be
demanded of Spain in return for aid.  “There’s some modest selling of Spain but the reaction
will be limited because we have the ECB in the background ready
to act and buy Spanish bonds,” said Marius Daheim, a senior
fixed-income strategist at  Bayerische Landesbank  in Munich.  Spanish 10-year yields have declined about two percentage
points since reaching a euro-era record 7.75 percent on July 25,
the day before ECB President  Mario Draghi  pledged to do
“whatever it takes” to safeguard  Europe ’s monetary union.
Italian 10-year yields have dropped more than 150 basis points
from 6.71 percent on July 25.  Germany ’s 10-year yield climbed two basis points to 1.51
percent after earlier declining as much as five basis points to
1.44 percent, the lowest since Oct. 4.  French 10-year bonds rose for a fourth day, the longest run
of advances since July, with the yield on the securities falling
less than one basis point to 2.19 percent.  French Volatility  Volatility on  Portugal ’s government bonds was the highest
in euro-region markets today, followed by Ireland, according to
measures of 10-year bonds, the spread between two- and 10-year
securities, and credit default swaps.  Yields on Ireland’s bonds maturing in October 2020 fell
three basis points to 4.92 percent, the lowest level since
August 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Belgium ’s 10-year yield fell as much as three basis points
to a record 2.39 percent. The nation canceled an optional
reverse-inquiry auction scheduled for tomorrow, the Belgian Debt
Agency said in a statement today.  German bunds returned 3.1 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities advanced 1.6 percent, while Italian debt earned 16
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
