Euroclear Bank SA, which owns the
world’s largest bond settlement system, wrote to  Russia ’s
markets watchdog seeking clarity on local securities rules
before it starts working in the country,  Vedomosti  said, citing
a letter to the Financial Markets Service.  Euroclear’s lawyers asked for an explanation of regulations
on the status of the securities holder, the confirmation that
rights to a security have been transferred and disclosure
requirements, Vedomosti said, citing the letter.  While Euroclear is technically ready to offer services in
Russia as soon as the nation’s central depository starts work,
the bank needs the explanation to show it’s in line with
international payment and settlement standards, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
