Global regulators revised a list of
too-big-to-fail  banks  earmarked for capital surcharges as part
of an effort to reflect market conditions.  The Financial Stability Board will publish the updated list
next month, Chairman  Mark Carney  told reporters following a
meeting in  Tokyo  that concluded today.  The FSB last year compiled a list of 29 so-called globally
systemic banks that should hold more capital than required by
other international agreements.  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM) ,  BNP Paribas SA (BNP) ,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , and  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA)  were provisionally earmarked to face the top level
of surcharges, set at 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets.  One bank almost certain to drop off the updated list is
 Dexia SA (DEXB) , the Franco-Belgian lender that is being broken up
after losing access to unsecured funding,  Karel Lannoo , chief
executive officer of the Centre for European Policy Studies in
Brussels, said last week.  Carney, who is also governor of the  Bank of Canada , said
that banks have made progress in bolstering their capital
levels, a benchmark of their resilience against insolvency.  The revised list will be based on data from the end of
2011, the FSB said in a statement. It will continue to be
updated annually, it said.  The FSB brings together government officials, regulators
and central bankers from the Group of 20 nations to coordinate
financial rule-making.  To contact the reporters on this story:
