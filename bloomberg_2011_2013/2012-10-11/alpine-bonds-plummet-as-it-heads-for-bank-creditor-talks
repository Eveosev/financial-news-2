Alpine Holding GmbH bonds tumbled
after Profil magazine reported the Austrian builder owned by
 Spain ’s  Fomento de Construcciones & Contratas SA  needs to raise
cash to continue operating.  Alpine’s 100 million euros ($129 million) of notes maturing
May 2017 were quoted at 55 cents on the euro, down from 106
cents Oct. 2, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
Salzburg-based company’s 90 million-euro bond maturing June 2016
traded at 42 cents.  The company is meeting creditor banks for talks tomorrow,
Johannes Gfrerer, a spokesman for Alpine, said by telephone. He

about. Alpine has 660 million euros of bank debt with lenders
including  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , Raiffeisenlandersbank OOe AG,
UniCredit Bank Austria AG, according to the Profil report.  Alpine needs 31 million euros by next week to stay in
business and may have writedowns of as much as 400 million euros
on building projects in south-eastern  Europe , the magazine

“assured,” and that it has the full support of its Madrid-
