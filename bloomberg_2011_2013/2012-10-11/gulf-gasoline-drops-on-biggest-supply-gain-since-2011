Gasoline weakened against New York
futures on the  Gulf Coast  after the region’s fuel supply grew
the most in almost a year.  Gulf gasoline inventories  gained 2 million barrels to 6.94
million in the week ended Oct. 5, the largest increase since
Oct. 28, Energy Department data showed. Supplies  nationwide 
dropped by 534,000 barrels to 195 million.  “The gasoline numbers are strong and go to show that if
anyone is producing or refining products right now, it’s the
Gulf Coast,” Carl Larry, president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions
LLC, said by phone from New York today. “The prices will
continue to go down and could put pressure on gasoline prices at
the pump across the country. Maybe a few cents, not much.”  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline slipped by
3 cents to 3 cents a gallon  over futures  traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 11:54 a.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Prompt delivery trimmed 3.79 cents to $2.9814.  Regular gasoline at the pump averaged $3.813 a gallon in
the U.S., compared with $3.784 a  week ago  and $3.396 a year ago,
according to website data from AAA, the nation’s largest
motoring organization.  Supplies of  distillate products  including heating oil and
 diesel fuel  gained 240,000 barrels to 37.6 million barrels on
the Gulf Coast, the  Department of Energy  reported today.
Nationwide, stocks declined by 3.2 million barrels to 121
million, with the East Coast leading the drop.  ‘High Inventories’  “The overall high inventories on the Gulf are good but
with the distillate levels so low, it’s not going to help ease
tight fuel supplies,” Larry said. “Those pipelines from the
Gulf to the East are going to be full of distillates instead of
gasoline.”  The premium for  ultra-low  sulfur diesel in the  New York 
Harbor slipped 0.12 cent to 11.38 cents over heating oil futures
at 12:08 p.m. The gap for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline was
unchanged at 20.25 cents a barrel versus New York futures.  Gasoline inventories fell 1.03 million barrels to 45.1
million on the East Coast, the lowest level since 2008 and the
region’s fourth consecutive loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
