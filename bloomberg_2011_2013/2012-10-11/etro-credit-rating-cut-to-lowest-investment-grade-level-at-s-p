Metro AG (MEO)  had its long-term  credit
rating  cut to the lowest investment-grade level by  Standard &
Poor’s  Ratings Services after Germany’s biggest retailer reduced
its 2012 profit forecast last week.  The  rating  on Dusseldorf, Germany-based Metro was cut to
BBB- from BBB, Standard & Poor’s said in a statement today. S&P
also lowered the short-term rating one level to A-3.  “The downgrade reflects a continuing trend of lower-than-
expected profitability,” S&P said. “Metro’s global
diversification fails to compensate for operating
underperformance in some of its European markets.”  S&P’s downgrade mirrors that of Moody’s Investors Service,
which on Oct. 9 cut the rating on Metro to Baa3, one level above
junk. Metro, the owner of Media-Markt electronics outlets and
Kaufhof department stores, said last week that earnings before
interest and taxes will decline to about 2 billion euros ($2.6
billion) in 2012 as  Europe ’s debt crisis weighs on sales in the
south and east of the region. It had previously forecast
earnings would be about the same as 2011’s 2.37 billion euros.  Chief Executive Officer Olaf Koch is focusing on the Cash &
Carry wholesale business and the Media-Saturn electronics chain
while cutting investment in Kaufhof and Real grocery outlets,
both of which he has said he may sell.  To contact the reporters on this story:
