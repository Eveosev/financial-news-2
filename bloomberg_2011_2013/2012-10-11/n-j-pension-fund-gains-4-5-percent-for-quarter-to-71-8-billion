New Jersey’s pension-fund assets
grew an estimated 4.5 percent for the first quarter of the
fiscal year, to $71.8 billion, according to a state investment
council report.  Global-growth assets gained 6.1 percent, followed by income
assets, which increased 3 percent. Risk mitigation was the
worst-performing category, gaining 0.3 percent.  New Jersey’s fund managers said they expect higher returns
when assets in the police and firefighters system, which lag
behind the others, are added to the results.  The funds are managed by the state investment division,
which oversees seven benefit pools for more than 780,000 current
and future retirees.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of stocks for the period,
July 1 to Sept. 30, returned 6.4 percent, including reinvested
dividends, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
