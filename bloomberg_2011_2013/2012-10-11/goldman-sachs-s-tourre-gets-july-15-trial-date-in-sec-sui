Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s Fabrice Tourre will go to trial July 15 in the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission’s lawsuit accusing him of misleading
investors in a collateralized debt obligation.  U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in  Manhattan  set the
trial date today at the end of a hearing in which an SEC lawyer
argued that she should reinstate some claims against Tourre that
another judge dismissed earlier in the case.  Last year, U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones threw out some
of the SEC’s claims after Tourre argued that he couldn’t be held
liable under U.S. securities law for transactions that occurred
outside the country.  The SEC argued today that the claims should be reinstated
because of a recent appeals court ruling that applied a broader
definition of “domestic securities transaction” than the one
used by Jones. Tourre’s case was assigned to Forrest last week.  Tourre, 33, who is studying for a Ph.D. in economics at the
 University of Chicago , wasn’t present in the courtroom today.
His lawyer,  Pamela Chepiga , told Forrest that she will check
with her client to make sure there is no conflict between his
exams and the trial date.  The SEC sued Goldman Sachs and Tourre in April 2010. The
New York-based investment bank agreed in July 2010 to pay
$550 million to settle the allegations against it.  The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-03229, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
