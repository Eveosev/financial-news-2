A U.K. regulator told 62 online
retailers that their websites may not comply with the country’s
consumer-protection rules and need to be changed.  The Office Fair Trading said a third of 156 retail websites
it checked “appeared to impose unreasonable restrictions on
customers’ rights to a refund.” Some 60 percent of the sites
told customers to contact them on a Web form instead of
supplying an e-mail address and at least 20 sites added
unexpected charges at check-out, according to a statement from
the agency.  The regulator didn’t name the retailers that it contacted
to raise its concerns. Traders that don’t make changes to comply
with the law risk enforcement action from the agency, it said.  The U.K. online retail market is set to climb in value to
77 billion pounds ($123.4 billion) this year, making it second
only to the U.S., according to a June  report  from the U.K.’s
department for business. The most common restriction cited on
websites was a requirement for the product to be in the original
packaging or in the original condition, which could infringe
shoppers’ rights to inspect or assess the product, the OFT said.  Earlier this week, the OFT said it may take action against
airlines that don’t include debit-card surcharges in their
advertised prices. It is also investigating hotels over deals
that may have limited online discounts for room sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
