A man was found dead today after
plunging to the ground from a walkway next to the Coq d’Argent
restaurant in the  City of London  finance district, police said.  “At 12:41 p.m., City of London police received reports of
a man being seen to fall from a walkway inside No. 1 Poultry,”
the police said in a statement. “He was pronounced dead at the
scene and the City of London police have launched an
investigation into the incident.”  The latest tragedy follows the death of a businesswoman who
fell to her death last month from the garden at the Coq
d’Argent, the rooftop restaurant owned by D&D London Ltd. The
garden has since been closed for the winter.  “It’s another tragic incident,” D&D Chairman and Chief
Executive Des Gunewardena said today in a telephone interview.
“We are investigating it and examining the CCTV but it looks to
us at the moment that the person didn’t enter the restaurant.”  The police gave no more details and didn’t identify the
man.  (Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
