Robert Griffin III may start for the
 Washington Redskins  against the  Minnesota Vikings  in three days
if he continues to show no signs of a concussion following a hit
in his last National Football League game.  The rookie quarterback said he didn’t experience dizziness
or feelings of being off-balance during practice yesterday.  “I haven’t had any symptoms at all,” he told reporters.
“Practice went good. I felt sharp. I feel right today. We’ll
see what happens come Sunday.”  Griffin was hit by Atlanta Falcons linebacker Sean
Witherspoon during a 24-17 loss Oct. 7.  “So far, so good,” Washington coach  Mike Shanahan  told
reporters after he limited Griffin’s practice. “Every day we’ll
monitor him and, if he feels good, we’re gonna go with him.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
