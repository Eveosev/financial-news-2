India ’s 10-year  bonds  advanced,
sending yields toward a two-month low, on speculation the
central bank will step up debt purchases to help counter an
economic slowdown.  The Reserve Bank of India has bought 820 billion rupees
($15.5 billion) of government notes in the fiscal year that
began April 1, compared with 41 billion rupees in the same
period a year earlier, central bank data show. The monetary
authority may buy as much as 1.2 trillion rupees of sovereign
securities in the next six months to offset tightness in cash
conditions, according to Barclays Plc.  “Demand for bonds from the central bank and market
participants in the second half will be greater than combined
supply,” Barclays analysts including Kumar Rachapudi wrote in a
research note yesterday. “This will trigger a rally in bonds in
the coming months.”  The yield on the notes maturing June 2022 fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.15 percent as of 9:32 a.m.
in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The
rate touched 8.14 percent on Oct. 9, the lowest level since Aug.
9.  Barclays predicts the 10-year bond yield will drop to 7.75
percent by Dec. 31 and 7.5 percent by the end of March.  India’s  economy  grew 5.5 percent in the three months ended
June, government data show. Growth was 5.3 percent in the
previous quarter, the least since 2009.  The fixed payment to lock in one-year borrowing costs was
little changed at 7.62 percent in Mumbai, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
