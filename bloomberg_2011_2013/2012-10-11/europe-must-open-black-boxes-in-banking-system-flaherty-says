Canadian Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty  said there are “black boxes” in  Europe ’s banking
system that will need to be uncovered.  While Europe is in better shape than it was a year ago and
has made progress in combating its crisis, some of its banks
still need to shore up their capital levels, Flaherty said.
Countries in the region also need to move ahead with
“structural reforms,” he said.  “There are some black boxes there they need to open,”
Flaherty said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in
 Tokyo , after a meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers. “We
know there is some weakness in some banks but we don’t have much
more information than that.”  European lenders, whose balance sheets swelled during the
credit boom to about three times the region’s gross domestic
product, are being urged by regulators to decrease their
riskiness by shrinking assets and boosting capital. The
 International Monetary Fund  said this week that European banks
may need to cut as much as $4.5 trillion in assets through 2013
if policy makers fall short of pledges to stem the fiscal
crisis.  Flaherty, who is in Tokyo to attend the annual meetings of
the IMF and the  World Bank , said there’s “cautious optimism”
about Europe at this year’s event.  “It’s in a better place now than it was a year ago,”
he said. “Some progress has been made, there’s more to be
done.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
