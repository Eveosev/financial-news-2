Cnooc Ltd. (883) ’s $15.1 billion bid for
Calgary-based  Nexen Inc. (NXY)  should be approved by the Canadian
government, former Bank of Canada Governor David Dodge said.  Speaking to reporters in Ottawa, Dodge said there is every
reason to allow the proposed takeover, and the fact that Cnooc
was willing to pay such a high premium for Nexen shows the
transaction is in Canada’s interest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
