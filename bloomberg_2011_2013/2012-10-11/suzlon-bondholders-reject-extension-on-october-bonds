Bondholders rejected  Suzlon Energy
Ltd. (SUEL) ’s request for a four-month moratorium to repay $220.8
million of debt due today, India’s biggest wind-turbine maker
said in an e-mailed statement.  Suzlon, based in the western Indian city of Pune, sought to
postpone repayment to Feb. 11, the second time it’s sought an
extension this year, as it needed time to raise funds. The
company has $200 million of zero-coupon convertible bonds and
$20.8 million of 7.5% convertible notes  maturing  today.  “We expect that an acceptable solution for all
stakeholders will be arrived at the earliest possible” time,
Chief Financial Officer Kirti Vagadia said in the statement.  The company’s shares, which have declined 11 percent this
year, fell as much as 5.2 percent in Mumbai to 15.70 rupees,
their lowest since Sept. 13. They were trading down 4.2 percent
to 15.85 rupees as of 9:31 a.m.  Suzlon, which has posted losses for three years, is under
pressure to raise cash. A lack of working capital constrained
its ability to complete orders in the quarter that ended June
30, Vagadia said in August after the company reported its
second-biggest quarterly loss since at least 2007.  The company got a 45-day extension to avert default in June
when it redeemed $360 million of convertible notes. The bonds
were repaid on July 27 after Suzlon borrowed $300 million from
banks and sold two Indian wind farms.  A global supply glut has depressed turbine prices by 23
percent from their peak in 2009, while the loss of government
incentives in  India  may cause order deferments in Suzlon’s home
market, according to Batlivala & Karani Securities India Pvt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
