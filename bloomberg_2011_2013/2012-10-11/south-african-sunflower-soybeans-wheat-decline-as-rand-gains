South African sunflower, soybeans
and wheat fell after the rand appreciated for a third day
against the dollar, making imports cheaper.  Sunflowers for December delivery dropped 2.1 percent, the
most for the contract on record, to 5,820 rand ($667) a metric
ton by the close in Johannesburg. Soybeans for delivery in the
same month fell 0.1 percent 5,490 rand a ton, while wheat
declined 0.2 percent to 3,570 rand a ton.  The rand climbed as much as 1.1 percent to 8.6493 against
the dollar today amid signs labor unrest that shut gold and
platinum mines and spread to the  transportation industry  is
easing.  “The currency rate that has gained is affecting crops
today,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at Klerksdorp, South
Africa-based Senwes Ltd., said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
