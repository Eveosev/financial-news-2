The Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority said it fined Guggenheim Securities LLC of  New York 
$800,000 for failing to supervise two collateralized debt
obligation traders who tried to hide a trading loss in 2008.  Alexander Rekeda, the former head of Guggenheim’s CDO Desk,
was suspended for one year and fined $50,000; Timothy Day, who
previously worked as a trader on Guggenheim’s CDO Desk, was
suspended for four months and fined $20,000, Finra said in a
statement.  “The traders deceived their customer and supported their
scheme through the use of inaccurate books and records, all of
which went undetected by the firm,” Brad Bennett, Finra’s chief
of enforcement, said in the statement.  Tripp Kyle, a spokesman for Guggenheim, said the firm has
“cooperated fully” with Finra throughout its investigation and
that the two men no longer work at the firm.  To contact the reporters on this story:
