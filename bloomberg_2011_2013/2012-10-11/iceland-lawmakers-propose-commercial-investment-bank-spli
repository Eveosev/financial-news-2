Icelandic lawmakers are moving ahead
with a motion to require the island’s lenders to split their
businesses into commercial and investment banking.  If approved, Industry Minister Steingrimur J. Sigfusson
will appoint a committee to oversee how to best conduct a
separation to minimize the risks posed to Iceland’s economy,
according to the  motion  posted on parliament’s website.  The committee will be asked to deliver its proposals by
Feb. 1 next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
