Diesel rose in northwest  Europe  as
Total SA purchased a cargo for a fourth day. Jet fuel barges
dropped.  Vitol Group purchased a shipment of naphtha, its 13th this
month. Gasoil advanced on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London, with the fuel’s crack, or premium to  Brent crude ,
climbing to the most this week.  Light Products  Two naphtha cargoes changed hands at $989 a metric ton,
according to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring the
Platts pricing window. That’s $4 less than yesterday’s deal.
Royal Dutch Shell Plc was the other buyer. BP and Koch
Industries Inc. were the sellers, according to the survey.  Naphtha’s  discount  to Brent crude widened to $5.61 a barrel
as of 2:42 p.m. local time, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a crude and products broker in  London . That
compares with $5.29 yesterday.  Barges of gasoline for loading in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp hub traded at $1,087 to $1,100 a ton, a similar survey
of the Argus Bulletin Board showed. That compares with $1,100 to
$1,104 yesterday.  The trades are for Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added
to make the finished fuel. Barges usually trade in lots of 1,000
tons to 2,000 tons.  The fuel’s crack, or premium to Brent, fell to $9.61 a
barrel from $10.36 in the previous session, PVM data showed.  Spain ’s Cia. Espanola de Petroleos SA, or Cepsa, sold a
cargo of gasoline to Trafigura Beheer BV, mostly priced at
$1,118 a ton, the survey of Platts showed. The consignment was
sold for loading at Santa Panagia in  Italy .  Middle Distillates  Total purchased a  diesel cargo  from Gunvor Group Ltd. at a
premium of $52 a ton to November gasoil, for delivery to  Le
Havre  in northern  France , the survey of Platts showed. That’s $1
higher than a trade yesterday to the same port.  BP Plc also bought a cargo, at $59 a ton more than the
gasoil futures contract, for delivery to Wilhelmshaven in
 Germany , it showed.  Diesel  barges  changed hands at $52 to $54 a ton more than
November gasoil, little changed from yesterday, according to the
survey.  Morgan Stanley purchased a barge of  jet fuel  at a premium
of $89 a ton to November gasoil futures, the survey showed. That
compares with a trade at $93 on Oct. 9.  Gasoil for November delivery rose 0.2 percent to $1,009.75
a ton as of 5:01 p.m. London time on the ICE exchange. The
contract for October, which expired at midday, was last at
$1,025.50 a ton.  “At current prices, the upcoming winter will be the most
expensive winter ever for the consumers using heating oil,”
 Olivier Jakob , managing director at Petromatrix GmbH, a
researcher in  Switzerland , said today in a note.  The amount of 0.1 percent sulphur gasoil to be delivered
through ICE this month increased to 318,800 tons, according to
data on Intercontinental Exchange Inc.’s website. That compares
with 190,000 tons in September and 112,000 tons in October 2011.  Barges of heating oil traded at premiums of $10 to $14 a
ton to November futures, the survey showed. Yesterday, a trade
took place at $14.  Gasoil’s crack , or premium to Brent, rose to $20.60 a
barrel versus $20.21 as of 4:30 p.m. yesterday. Brent advanced
0.6 percent to $115.05 a barrel.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  traded at $626 to $629 a ton, in lien
with yesterday, the survey of Platts showed. The low sulfur
grade changed hands at $665 a ton, versus $660 to $665 in the
previous session.  Refineries  Repsol SA shut a fluid catalytic cracker at its La Coruna
refinery in Spain yesterday following a fire. The FCC unit
remains shut and the rest of the refinery is running normally,
the Madrid-based company said today. The refinery has the
capacity to process 120,000 barrels of crude a day and the FCC
unit can handle 68,000 barrels daily, according to data compiled
