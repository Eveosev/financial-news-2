Russiaâ€™s sunflower-seed crop reached
3.9 million metric tons so far in the current season, against 2
million tons a year earlier, SovEcon said.  Harvesting covered 60 percent of the sown area, the Moscow-
based researcher said on its  website  today, citing Agriculture
Ministry figures. Yields averaged 1.41 tons a hectare (2.47
acres), compared with 1.72 tons last year, it said.  The sunflower-seed harvest may approach 7 million tons,
SovEcon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
