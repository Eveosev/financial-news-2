The cotton crop in the U.S.,
the world’s biggest exporter, will be 1 percent bigger than
forecast last month as yields increase, the government
said.  The harvest that began last month will bring in 17.287
million bales, up from 17.11 million projected in
September, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in
a report. The average estimate of eight analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey was 17.18 million. The previous crop
totaled 15.57 million bales, each weighing 480 pounds, or
218 kilograms.  The estimate was increased because there’s “less
abandonment compared with last year” when fields in  Texas ,
the top producing state, were scorched by the worst drought
in at least a century,  Michael Smith , the president of T&K
Futures and Options in  Port St. Lucie ,  Florida , said in an
e-mail before the report. “There has been no serious yield
damage to the crop” from dry weather this year, he said.  Cotton futures have plunged 67 percent from a record
$2.197 a pound in March 2011 as the higher prices eroded
demand and boosted global output. The December contract
closed yesterday at 72.1 cents, up 0.4 percent, on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York .  U.S. growers may export 11.6 million bales in the
marketing year that began Aug. 1, down from 11.71 million
in the previous season, the USDA said. Unsold supplies at
the end of the year will total 5.6 million bales, up 67
percent from 3.35 million last year, according to the
report.  Projected Yields  Yields may reach 795 pounds per acre, up from 786
pounds projected last month and 790 pounds in the previous
year, the USDA said.  World output will reach 116.32 million bales, down 6.3
percent from 124.13 million the previous year, the USDA
said. Last month’s estimate was 114.03 million bales.  Consumption will be 106.87 million bales, up 3.6
percent from 103.17 million last year, the department said.  Global stockpiles on July 31, 2013, may total 79.11
million bales, 3.4 percent more than the 76.52 million
forecast in September, the USDA said.  Estimated inventories in  China , the biggest user of
the fiber, at the end of this marketing year were raised
3.1 percent to 36.61 million bales from September. China
will import 11 million bales in the next season, down 55
percent from 24.53 million last year, the USDA said.  Output in  India , the world’s second-largest exporter,
may reach 25.5 million bales, down 7.3 percent from 27.5
million last year, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
