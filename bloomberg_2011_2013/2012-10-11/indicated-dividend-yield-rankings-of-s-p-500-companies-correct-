(Corrects the payout ratios calculations to annual dividend paid in the
story published on September 30.)  The table below ranks indicated dividend yields
of companies in Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index as of September 30. The yield is
calculated by taking the latest declared dividend, annualized and divided by
the stock price. Payout ratios are calculated based on the latest annual
dividend paid divided by earnings.  The average yield is 2.51 percent. Pitney Bowes Inc offers the highest
yield at 10.85 percent while Precision Castparts Corp provides the lowest at
0.07 percent.  The data is sorted by indicated dividend yield in descending order.
Dividends are paid on a quarterly basis unless noted.
