Siemens AG (SIE)  and  Alstom SA (ALO)  will
compete for a 1 billion-euro ($1.29 billion) Belgian railway
contract to upgrade the country’s rail network with a new safety
system that will prevent trains running a red light, L’Echo
 reported .  SNCB Holding (SNCVP) , Belgium’s state-owned railway, will choose
the successful bidder in June or July 2013 and aim to deploy the
technology across the network by 2022, L’Echo said today, citing
an unidentified spokesman for SNCB’s Infrabel unit. The contract
is part of a 3.85-billion euro program to upgrade Belgium’s rail
system following a 2010 collision between two trains that killed
19 people, L’Echo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
