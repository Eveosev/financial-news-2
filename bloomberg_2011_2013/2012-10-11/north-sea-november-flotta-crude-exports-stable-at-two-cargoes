Exports of North Sea Flotta crude
will be two cargoes of 600,000 barrels each in November,
according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  This compares with two shipments of 650,000 barrels each
for October.  Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM)  operates the field.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
