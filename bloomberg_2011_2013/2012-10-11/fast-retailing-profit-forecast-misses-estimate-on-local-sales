Fast Retailing Co. (9983)  fell the most in
more than a year after forecasting annual profit below analyst
estimates as a slowdown in global economic growth hurt sales of
the retailer’s Uniqlo branded apparel.  The stock dropped as much as 11 percent, the most since
March 15, 2011 on an intra-day basis, before trading 9.6 percent
lower at 16,100 yen at 10:19 a.m. in  Tokyo . The Nikkei 225 stock
average rose 0.3 percent.  The apparel company said businesses in  China ,  South Korea ,
the U.K. and the U.S. missed targets as consumers pulled back.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch cuts its earnings estimates for
the retailer and UBS AG downgraded the stock to ‘sell’ from
‘neutral.’  “Economic weakness could mean slower growth for now,” UBS
said in a note to clients. “In the U.S. and  Europe  brand
awareness is an issue, and its target of halving its losses
could be hard.”  The apparel company yesterday forecast net income of 84.5
billion yen ($1.08 billion) for the year ending August 2013,
below the 87.5 billion yen average  estimate  of 21 analysts
compiled by Bloomberg.  Overseas sales at its Uniqlo outlets rose 63 percent to
153.1 billion yen, missing the retailer’s own target of 157
billion yen. Domestic sales rose to 620 billion yen, lower than
its 621.5 billion yen estimate.  The casual clothing maker, controlled by President  Tadashi
Yanai , has expanded outside Japan to reduce its reliance on its
home market. Fast Retailing said it’s “cautious” about its
China and Hong Kong sales because of slowing global economic
growth. Fourth-quarter earnings in China and South Korea didn’t
meet the company’s target because of the economic slowdown,
Chief Financial Officer Takeshi Okazaki said yesterday.  Net income rose 32 percent to 71.7 billion yen for the last
fiscal year, below the 78.7 billion yen average estimate of 20
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  China Closures  Fast Retailing closed as many as 60 outlets in China
temporarily last month amid violent protests over a territorial
dispute. The diplomatic spat flared up after  Japan ’s government
said it would buy the islands, known as the Diaoyu in China and
the Senkaku in Japanese, from their private Japanese owner.  China claims that it’s owned the islands for centuries,
while Japan argues it took administrative control of them in
1895, lost its claim after World War II and had the islands
returned to it in 1972.  The Yamaguchi, western Japan-based company forecast sales
of 1.06 trillion yen for the current fiscal year, higher than
the 1.05 trillion yen average estimate of 21 analysts compiled
by Bloomberg.  Store Openings  By 2020, Fast Retailing plans to have 1,000 outlets in
Japan, and the same amount in China and the same in  North
America  and Europe combined, Yanai said yesterday. Another 1,000
will be opened in other parts of  Asia  and the company plans to
achieve 5 trillion yen in sales by that year, he said. Its
overseas sales are expected to exceed the domestic market in the
2015 fiscal year, he said in April. Yanai is Japan’s richest man
with an estimated net worth of $11.6 billion, according to the
 Bloomberg Billionaires Index .  To contact the reporters on this story:
