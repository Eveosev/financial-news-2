Navistar International Corp. (NAV) , the
truckmaker trying to end losses, rose as much as 6.3 percent
after investor  Carl Icahn  announced a hostile tender offer for
competitor  Oshkosh Corp. (OSK)   Navistar rose 5.2 percent to $23.14 at 12:14 p.m.  New York 
time after reaching $23.37, the highest intraday price since
Sept. 24. Shares in the Lisle, Illinois-based company dropped 42
percent this year through yesterday.  Icahn said today he plans to start a tender offer of $32.50
for Oshkosh shares, a 21 percent premium over yesterday’s
 closing price . Icahn, who this week agreed with Navistar to add
at least one director to that truckmaker’s board, said he
intends to nominate a slate of Oshkosh directors.  Navistar’s four largest investors hold about  50 percent  of
the shares, including a  14.9 percent  stake held by Icahn, 76.
The billionaire investor publicly disclosed stakes in Navistar
and Oshkosh last year, prompting speculation that he would push
the two companies to merge or combine their defense businesses.  Icahn’s agreement this week with Navistar averted a proxy
fight the investor had threatened. Icahn has pressured
Navistar’s new management, led by former  Textron Inc. (TXT)  Chief
Executive Officer Lewis Campbell, after the company had a net
loss of $241 million for the first three quarters of its fiscal
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
