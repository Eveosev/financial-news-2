Power for delivery tomorrow in
 Poland  slid on increased supply as cross-border exports to
neighboring countries were set to halt for most of tomorrow.  Day-ahead power lost 5.9 percent to 182.04 zloty ($57.55)
as Poland was forecast to halt flows abroad at all times
tomorrow except for 490 megawatts at 7 a.m., 5 p.m. and 10 p.m.
Warsaw time to the  Czech Republic , Slovakia and  Germany . That’s
compared with as much as 1,595 megawatts at 7 a.m. today, data
from grid manager  PSE Operator  SA show.  A 460-megawatt facility at the Lagisza plant owned by
 Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE)  halted yesterday and will be offline
for five days, the company said.  A 200-megawatt unit at ZE PAK SA’s Patnow power plant will
be halted until Oct. 26 due to an unspecified malfunction, data
from PSE Operator showed.  Next-day contracts on the Czech and Slovak markets settled
10 percent lower at 46.01 euros ($59.50) a megawatt-hour in a
daily auction. Electricity for the next day in  Hungary  decreased
13 percent to 46.54 euros a megawatt-hour, according to the
countries’ market operators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
