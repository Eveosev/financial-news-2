Former Bank of  England  policy maker
DeAnne Julius said Paul Tucker may be the “safest” choice to
succeed Mervyn King as governor because he is well known to the
people making the appointment.  “If I were still on Court, or on a board of that sort,
usually the internal candidate is the safest because you know
that person well,” Julius said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television in London today. The Court is the Bank of England’s
governing body.  Asked if Tucker was justifiably the favorite for the
governorship, Julius said “probably,” adding that the other
candidates for the role are “perfectly credible.” She declined
to say if Tucker would be her choice.  The deadline for applications for the Bank of England
governorship closed earlier this week. Chancellor of the
Exchequer George Osborne will announce a successor to King, who
steps down in June, by the end of the year. Julius said she
didn’t apply as the new, eight-year term would have required too
great a commitment.  “I have quite a good life at the moment,” she said. “To
sign up for an eight-year stint of essentially a 24/7 job with
that kind of pressure is something you have to really want to
do, and be committed to do, to apply.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
