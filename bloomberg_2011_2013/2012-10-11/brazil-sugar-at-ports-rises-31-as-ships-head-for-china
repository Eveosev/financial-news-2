The amount of sugar waiting to be
loaded onto ships in top producer  Brazil  jumped 31 percent over
the past week, with vessels heading to  China ,  Malaysia  and
India, according to Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda.  About 2.17 million metric tons of the sweetener awaited
loading at the ports of Recife, Maceio, Paranagua and Santos,
the country’s biggest, data e-mailed yesterday from the Recife,
Brazil-based Williams Brasil showed. That compared with 1.66
million tons a week earlier, according to the shipping agency.  Ships headed to China are set to take about 11 percent, or
245,000 tons, of all the sugar waiting at the ports, the data
showed. Vessels bound to Malaysia will take 218,000 tons and
shipments scheduled for India, the world’s second-biggest
producer and largest consumer, totaled 199,000 tons.  India  is importing for its refining business and
potentially for domestic consumption after dry weather cut
output. Sugar production there will be 23.5 million tons in the
2012-13 season started this month, down 2.7 million tons from a
year earlier, Paris-based trading company Sucres et Denrees SA
said in a quarterly report e-mailed yesterday.  “Imports of raw sugar for the domestic markets are now
close to break-even despite the 10 percent import duty,” Sucres
et Denrees said in the report. “Sustained flows of raw sugar
should take place between center south Brazil and India over the
fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013.”  Raw sugar for March delivery dropped 1.9 percent to 20.85
cents a pound by 5:55 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
