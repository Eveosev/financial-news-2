Coffee production in  Vietnam , the
world’s biggest grower of the robusta variety used by  Nestle SA (NESN) 
in instant drinks, is poised to decline from a record as dry
weather cuts yields, bolstering prices.  The harvest may drop 9.4 percent to 1.45 million metric
tons in the season that started Oct. 1 from an all-time high of
1.6 million tons in 2011-2012, according to the median of eight
trader and shipper estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That’s less
than the 26 million bags (1.56 million tons) estimated by
Volcafe Ltd. A bag weighs 132 pounds.  Robusta rallied 16 percent in  London  this year on rising
demand from roasters after arabica beans, favored for specialty
drinks such as those made by  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , soared to a 14-
year high. A smaller harvest in Vietnam may help sustain the
rally, potentially raising costs for Nestle, the world’s biggest
food company. Consumption of robusta will grow at a faster rate
than arabica, Luigi Lavazza SpA said last month.  “There wasn’t much rain this year, so there wasn’t enough
water for the trees to develop and for the beans to grow,” said
Mai Ky Van, a deputy director at October Coffee-Cocoa One Member
Ltd. in Dak Lak province, Vietnam’s biggest growing region.
“Coffee output in my area may fall about 20 percent.”  Krong Pak district, where October Coffee-Cocoa is based, is
among the largest coffee-growing areas in  Dak Lak . Rainfall was
23 percent less than normal in the first nine months of this
year, according to the Meteorology and Hydrology Department. The
district received 756.1 millimeters from the start of the year
to Sept. 30, less than the 986.2 millimeters average, it said.  Early Harvest  “From the end of June, there was less rain, and when it
came to July and August, the rainfall amount was much smaller
than previous years,” said Nguyen Dai Nguong, head of Dak Lak’s
 meteorology  department.  The prolonged dry period hampered growth of beans and
caused some pest attacks and diseases that led to fruits
dropping, said Tran Kinh Doanh, who has been growing coffee for
more than 20 years. Doanh, also a coffee middleman in  Buon Ma
Thuot , expects a 20 percent drop in output in his area.  The harvest this year may start 10 to 15 days earlier than
usual in Dak Lak, Doanh said. October Coffee-Cocoa started
picking beans selectively on Oct. 7, a fortnight earlier than
usual, and the main harvest will be in mid-November to early
December, according to Van, the deputy director.  The crop may decline 15 percent to 20 percent in 2012-2013
as output typically drops after a  bumper crop , Do Ha Nam, deputy
chairman of the Vietnam Coffee & Cocoa Association, said Aug.
24. An increase in aging plantations and possible rain storms
during harvest may hurt the crop, he said.  Ensuring Demand  Vietnam needs to harvest at least 26 million bags in the
marketing season starting this month to ensure supplies of the
variety will meet demand, according to Volcafe, the coffee unit
of commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd. Robusta will
account for 46 percent of consumption in 2012-2013, up from 44
percent in 2011-2012, it said.  Robusta for delivery in November rose 0.3 percent to $2,104
a ton today on NYSE Liffe. Arabica for December delivery fell
0.4 percent to $1.628 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .
Robusta’s discount to arabica has shrunk to about 68 cents a
pound, from 145 cents at the end of 2011.  Vietnam shipped 75,000 tons in September, according to
preliminary data from the General Statistics Office in Hanoi,
bringing  exports  in the first nine months to an estimated 1.34
million tons, up 35 percent from a year earlier. Shipments in
the year ended September are estimated at a record 1.6 million
tons, according to the GSO.  Robusta is harvested mainly in  Asia  and parts of  Africa ,
while arabica is grown in  Latin America .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
