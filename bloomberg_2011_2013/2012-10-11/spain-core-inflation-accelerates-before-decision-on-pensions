A sales tax increase in  Spain  stoked
a rise in  core inflation  in September, complicating efforts to
plug the euro area’s third-biggest budget  deficit .  The  underlying inflation  rate, which excludes energy and
fresh food prices, rose for the first time in three months,
increasing to 2.1 percent from 1.4 percent in August, the
National Statistics Institute in Madrid said today. That
compares with a 1.7 percent median forecast of five estimates in
a Bloomberg survey. Prices rose 0.9 percent from August.  A three percentage point increase in value-added tax came
into effect Sept. 1, adding pressure on indebted households
suffering from the highest  unemployment rate  in the European
Union. The country is the most difficult market in  Europe  for
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Spain-based Seat brand, Paul Sevin, vice
president for sales and marketing said last month.  Headline inflation, based on European Union calculations,
matched an initial estimate of 3.5 percent on Sept. 28. That was
the most in 17 months and compared with a rate of 2.7 percent in
August.  Deputy Economy Minister Fernando Jimenez Latorre last week
said he expects consumer prices to slow in coming months as
energy will have a smaller impact. The government is waiting for
November data to take a decision on pension payments after
increasing them by 1 percent in January.  Under Spanish law, if annual inflation in November exceeds
that rate, the government must make up the difference, a move
that could lead the nation to miss its budget goals, the Bank of
Spain said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
