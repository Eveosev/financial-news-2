Lietuvos Energija AB will start
operating a new 455-megawatt combined cycle gas turbine at the
Lietuvos Elektrine power plant at the end of October, the  Baltic
News Service  reported, citing Lithuania’s state-owned power
company.  The unit, built by  Iberdrola SA (IBE)  of Spain and Lithuanian
partners at a cost of more than 1 billion litai ($373 million),
will operate intermittently and at low capacity until summer,
when demand is expected to rise, the newswire said, citing the
company.  The turbine can supply as much as a quarter of Lithuania’s
electricity needs, BNS said, without citing a source.  To contact the reporter on this story:
