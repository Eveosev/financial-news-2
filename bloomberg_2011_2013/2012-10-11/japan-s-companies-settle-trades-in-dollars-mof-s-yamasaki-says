Japanese companies with businesses
overseas are settling trades in dollars to curb costs as the yen
strengthens, said Tatsuo Yamasaki, director general of the
international bureau at  Japan ’s Ministry of Finance.  Government attempts to internationalize the yen have lapsed
as domestic companies continue to deal in dollars, Yamasaki said
at a seminar at an International Monetary Fund event in  Tokyo 
today. The yen is used to settle 40 percent of export trades,
and 23 percent for imports, he said.  Yamasaki said Japanese banks’ growing presence in global
finance after the financial crisis is a step towards
internationalizing the yen.  Japan will continue talks with the Chinese government to
strengthen cooperation in financial markets as the two nations
are in “a mutually beneficial relationship,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
