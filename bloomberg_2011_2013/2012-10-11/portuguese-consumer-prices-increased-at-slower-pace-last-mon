Portugal ’s  consumer price index  rose
in September from a year earlier at a slower pace than recorded
in August.  Consumer prices, using a harmonized European Union measure,
climbed 2.9 percent from a year earlier, less than the 3.2
percent increase in August, the Lisbon-based National Statistics
Institute said today in an e-mailed statement. Prices rose 0.4
percent from August.  Using the statistics institute’s own methods, consumer
prices in Portugal also rose 2.9 percent in September from a
year earlier and climbed 0.6 percent from August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
