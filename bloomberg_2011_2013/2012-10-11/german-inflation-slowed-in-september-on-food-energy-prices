Germany ’s inflation rate fell in
September as food and energy price pressures eased.  Inflation, calculated using a harmonized European Union
method, slowed to 2.1 percent from 2.2 percent in August, the
Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today, confirming a
Sept. 26 estimate. In the month, consumer prices were unchanged.  The European Central Bank forecasts that euro-area
inflation will slow to below its 2 percent limit next year.  Germany’s non-harmonized inflation rate fell to 2 percent
in September from 2.1 percent in August, the statistics office
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
