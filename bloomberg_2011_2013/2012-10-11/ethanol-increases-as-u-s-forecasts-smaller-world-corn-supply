Ethanol climbed the most in almost
two weeks, rising with corn after the government forecast a
decline in world inventories because of the U.S. drought.  The biofuel rose to a one-month high as corn soared after
the Agriculture Department predicted worldwide inventories on
Oct. 1 will be 117.27 million metric tons, down from 123.95
million predicted a month ago, amid the worst U.S. drought in
more than a half century. U.S. ethanol is made from corn.  “The gains were tied 100 percent to corn,” said Jerrod Kitt, director of research at Linn Group in  Chicago .  Denatured ethanol for November delivery increased 7 cents,
or 2.9 percent, to $2.467 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price has risen 12 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol gained 4 cents to $2.55 a
gallon in  New York , 6.5 cents to $2.455 in Chicago, 5 cents to
$2.515 on the  Gulf Coast  and 3 cents to $2.59 on the West Coast.  Corn for December delivery climbed 36.5 cents to $7.7325 a
bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  Crude oil for November delivery increased 82 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $92.07 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Gasoline for November delivery declined 0.37 cent to
$2.9556 a gallon in New York. The contract covers reformulated
gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to
filling stations.
