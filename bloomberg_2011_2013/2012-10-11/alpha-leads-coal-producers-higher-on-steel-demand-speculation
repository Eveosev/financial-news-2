Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) , the
second-largest U.S. coal producer, jumped the most in a month
and its competitors rallied amid speculation metallurgical-coal
prices may rise after the cost of Chinese rebar rebounded.  Alpha  soared  13 percent to $8.28 at 2:13 p.m. in New York,
after earlier climbing 17 percent, the most intraday since Sept.
7. Arch Coal Inc. gained as much as 15 percent, the most
intraday since July 27, while  Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) ,  Consol
Energy Inc. (CNX)  and  Walter Energy Inc. (WLT)  also increased.  Chinese prices for rebar, which is used to reinforce
concrete, have rebounded and pulled up prices for  iron ore , said
David Beard, a New Orleans-based analyst for Iberia Capital
Partners LLC. That may lead to higher demand for metallurgical
coal, which is used to make steel, he said.  “We know the sector is abysmal,” Beard said in a
telephone interview. “You’ve seen enough production cuts in
coal that you could easily see a scenario where if demand
doesn’t drop, we could see a slight shortage.”  Alpha, based in Bristol, Virginia, is among producers
cutting output this year after coal prices dropped. Alpha said
last month it will close eight mines, eliminating 1,200 jobs and
reducing output in its biggest production cut since a boom in
shale-gas output began driving down fuel prices.  Peabody is the largest U.S. coal miner by output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
