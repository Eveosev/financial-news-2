A Greek exit from the euro area would
be “a controlled event for the rest of Europe,” said Hamid
Biglari,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  vice-chairman in charge of emerging
markets.  “The  European Central Bank  has done much to limit the risk
of contagion,” Biglari said in an interview with Bloomberg HT
television in Istanbul today.  Greece’s political leaders held a fifth day of talks to
carve out a government. The standoff has reignited European
concerns over Greece’s ability to hold to terms of its two
bailouts negotiated since May 2010 and sparked concerns about
the country leaving the euro.  Greece’s withdrawal from the euro would be “very bad for
its banking system and economy,” Biglari said. The situation is
“uncertain, with many possible outcomes and too many
variables,” he added.  The effect on Citigroup of  Greece ’s exit “wouldn’t be that
large,” Biglari said. “We at Citi have negligible exposure to
the periphery.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
