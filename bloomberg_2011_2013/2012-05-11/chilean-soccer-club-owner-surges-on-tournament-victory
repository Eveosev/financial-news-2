Azul Azul SA (AZUL) , the owner of the
Universidad de Chile soccer team, rose the most in six months
after moving through to the next stage of the Libertadores
regional soccer tournament.  The  stock  jumped 34 percent to 1,927.8 pesos, the steepest
increase since Oct. 21. Chile’s Ipsa index fell 0.2 percent.  The team beat Deportivo Quito 6-0 in the return leg of a
fixture last night, eliminating the Ecuadorean team that won 4-1
in a first tie. Universidad de Chile will progress to play
 Paraguay ’s Libertad in the quarterfinal of  South America ’s top
soccer club tournament.  Junior Fernandes, who scored two goals in yesterday’s
match, may be sold for at least $5 million to a European side,
Santiago-based newspaper La Tercera reported, without saying
