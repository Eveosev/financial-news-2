Poland  sold 25 billion yen (313
million) of five-year Samurai bonds in its second offering to
individual investors in  Japan .  The bond maturing in May 2017 was priced to yield 1.49
percent or 100 basis points above mid-swaps, the  Finance
Ministry  said in a statement on its website today. It planned to
sell the notes with yield between 1.3 percent and 1.7 percent,
according to a May 1 filing.  “The bond launched today is the first retail-targeted
transaction of a foreign issuer on the Japanese market in
2012,” the ministry said in the statement. It’s also “the
second retail bond issued by the Republic of Poland on the
Japanese market.”  The European Union’s largest eastern economy debuted on the
Japanese retail  bond market  in July, when it sold 25 billion yen
of four-year bonds. The debt was priced to yield 1.25 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Samurai bonds are yen-denominated debt sold in Japan by
overseas borrowers. Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co. managed
this and last year’s sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
