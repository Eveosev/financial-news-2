U.S. stocks erased gains as JPMorgan
Chase & Co.’s $2 billion trading loss weighed on banks and a
drop in oil prices dragged down energy companies, snuffing out
an advance triggered by an increase in  consumer confidence .  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.1 percent to
1,359.28 at 1:28 p.m. after gaining as much as 0.6 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
