OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s largest producer
of metallurgical coal, said it lent money to billionaire
Chairman Igor Zyuzin, and that he funds have since been repaid.  The largest loan amount was $135.7 million in June 2010,
Moscow-based Mechel said in a regulatory filing today. No loans
to Zyuzin are outstanding, it said.  Zyuzin acquired Brazilian steelmaker Usina Siderurgica do
Para Ltda in 2010.  “In September 2010, the controlling shareholder acquired
Usina Siderurgica do Para Ltda, or Usipar, a steel company
located in  Brazil ,” Mechel said in the filing. Mechel purchased
$72 million of  pig iron  from Usipar and sold $61 million of coke
and other raw materials to Usipar last year, it said.  Mechel didn’t lend any funds to Zyuzin’s companies for the
purpose of buying the Brazilian steelmaker, the company’s press-
service said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
