Colombia ’s peso headed for its first
weekly drop in almost a month as prices fell for oil, the
country’s biggest export, and Greece’s struggle to form a
government damped demand for the South American nation’s higher-
yielding assets.  “There is concern about  Europe , and that hits Colombia,”
said William Florez, an analyst at Helm Bank SA’s brokerage unit
in Bogota. “It leads to sensitivity and a flight to safer
assets.”  The peso was little changed at 1,763.40 per  U.S. dollar  at
9:40 a.m. in Bogota and has fallen 0.3 percent this week in its
first five-day drop since April 13. The currency has rallied 9.9
percent this year, making it the best performer among all of the
world’s counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  Oil fell after  China  reported that industrial production
grew at the slowest pace since 2009. Crude for June delivery
declined 0.3 percent to $96.78 a barrel in New York.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 7.11 percent, according to the central bank. The price
increased 0.044 centavo to 123.056 centavos per peso.  The peso touched a four-week low of 1,782.63 per dollar on
May 9 as Greece’s political leaders tried to carve out a
government after inconclusive elections. Spain took control of a
lender this week in its fourth attempt in three years to
convince investors the nation’s banking system is solid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
