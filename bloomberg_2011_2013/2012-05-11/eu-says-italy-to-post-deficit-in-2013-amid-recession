Italy will slowly emerge from its
fourth recession since 2001 and miss its goal of a balanced
budget next year, the European Commission said.  Italy’s gross domestic product will fall 1.4 percent this
year before increasing 0.4 percent in 2013, the Brussels-based
commission said in a report today. The  budget deficit  will be 2
percent of GDP in 2012 and 1.1 percent next year, it said.  The euro region’s third-biggest economy is “is set to
continue to contract in the first half of 2012, as spending and
investment plans of consumers and firms are held back by poor
labor-market prospects and still-high uncertainty in financial
markets,” the commission said.  Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s government last month delayed
its balanced-budget goal by one year until 2014 amid a deepening
recession. The deficit of 0.1 percent previously estimated for
2013 won’t be reached until 2014, the Cabinet said in its three-
year economic plan.  Italy’s debt will peak at 123.5 percent of GDP this year
and fall to 121.8 percent in 2013, helped by an increasing
primary surplus, according to today’s report. Those forecasts
compare with a debt at 123.4 percent this year and 121.5 percent
next estimated by the government last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
