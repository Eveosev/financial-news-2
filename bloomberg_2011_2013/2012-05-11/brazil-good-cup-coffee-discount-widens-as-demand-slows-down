Buyers of good cup-quality coffee
from Brazil, the world’s largest producer of the commodity, are
getting a bigger discount for their beans amid slower demand,
according to Volcafe, a unit of ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.  Good-cup beans for June and July shipment were trading at a
discount of 18 cents a pound to prices on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York , data from the trader show. That compares with a 15-
cent discount last week.  “Differentials have softened a little, but there is very
little interest for nearby,” the Winterthur, Switzerland-based
trader said in a report e-mailed today. A differential is a
discount or premium for physical coffee relative to futures
prices.  In the Brazilian market, producers released “decent
volumes,” according to Volcafe.  Arabica coffee for July delivery dropped 0.3 percent to
$1.7815 a pound by 10:58 a.m. on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
