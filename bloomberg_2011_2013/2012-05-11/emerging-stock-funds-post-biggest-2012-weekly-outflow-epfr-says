Emerging-market stock funds had their
biggest weekly outflows in 2012 as the prospect of a deeper
recession in  Europe  prompted $1.11 billion of sales for the five
days ended May 9, according to EPFR Global.  Net investment into developing-nation  equity  funds has
totaled $22.72 billion in 2012, compared with outflows of $12.07
billion for the same period in 2011, according to a report e-
mailed today by the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based data
provider.  So-called Global Emerging-Market funds, or GEM funds,
recorded net outflows for the week of $598 million, the data
show, after recording net inflows of $371 million in the prior
week. India-dedicated equity funds recorded the biggest
redemptions among Asian country fund groups, posting net
outflows of $110 million while China funds posted a net outflow
of $35 million,  Cameron Brandt , EPFR director of research, said
by e-mail today.  Latin American funds saw a net outflow of $187 million
while Russia equity funds recorded their biggest redemptions
since December as net outflows totaled $188 million. Asian funds
excluding  Japan  recorded a net outflow of $75 million.  The average emerging-market equity portfolio declined 4.48
percent for the week, cutting the 2012 advance to 7.68 percent,
Brandt said.  Emerging-market bond fund inflows reached an eight-week
high of $1.05 billion, Brandt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
