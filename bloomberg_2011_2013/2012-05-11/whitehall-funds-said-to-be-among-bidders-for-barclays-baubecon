Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s Whitehall
real-estate funds and  GSW Immobilien AG (GIB)  made an offer for
Barclays Plc’s Baubecon GmbH residential landlord unit, two
people with knowledge of the matter said.  Deutsche Wohnen AG (DWNI)  is also among the companies that have
bid for Baubecon, according to the people, who declined to be
identified because the auction is private. Baubecon, owner of
21,000 homes in German cities including Berlin and Magdeburg, is
valued at 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion), according to
Barclays’ 2011 annual report.  Barclays took over Baubecon when borrowers Prelios SpA and
Deutsche Bank AG’s RREEF Real Estate refused to provide the
company with more money. Prelios and RREEF bought Baubecon for
1.67 billion euros ($2.2 billion) in 2007. Barclays provided a
1.3 billion-euro loan for the acquisition.  Roland Leithaeuser, a spokesman for Goldman, GSW spokesman
Nikolaus von Raggamby and Deutsche Wohnen spokeswoman Manuela
Damianakis declined to comment. Marc Hazelton, a spokesman for
London-based Barclays, also declined to comment.  Financial Times Deutschland reported the bids on May 9.  Whitehall is a Goldman Sachs-managed fund that invests in
real estate for Goldman and its clients. GSW is based Berlin and
Deutsche Wohnen is based in  Frankfurt .  To contact the reporter on this story:
