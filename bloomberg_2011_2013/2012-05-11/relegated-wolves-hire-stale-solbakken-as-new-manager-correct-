Wolverhampton Wanderers hired Stale
Solbakken as their new manager, the relegated Premier League
club said on its website.  Solbakken, 44, was fired by Cologne, which was relegated
from the German Bundesliga last week, on April 13 after less
than a year in charge. The Norwegian previously coached FC
Copenhagen, winning five league titles in six seasons, and will
take over Wolves on July 1, the club said.  Solbakken will replace Terry Connor, who was named interim
manager when  Mick McCarthy  was fired in February. Connor will
coach the season finale against Wigan in two days.  Wolves are last in the Premier League with 25 points and
will drop to the second-tier Championship next season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
