Jean-Michel Basquiat’s 1981 painting
of a skeletal, Christ-like figure sold for $16.3 million at
Phillips de Pury’s contemporary-art auction last night, setting
a record for the late Neo-expressionist painter.  The auction house estimated a price between $8 million and
$12 million for the 6-by-4-foot canvas, which was consigned by
collector  Robert Lehrman . It attracted three telephone bidders
but no one in the midtown Manhattan sales room where lots of
seats were empty.  The painting, one of 11 in the sale guaranteed to sell, was
the top lot of an auction that totaled $86.9 million, within the
expected range of $75.9 million to $110.7 million. Of the 44
lots, nine failed to sell, including pieces by  Gerhard Richter ,
 Cy Twombly  and  Richard Prince .  “Things that are desirable and iconic sell very well,”
said Simone Battisti, who recently joined the  Gladstone Gallery 
in New York and Brussels as associate director. “Others
don’t.”  Owned by the Russian retailer Mercury Group, the  Phillips 
sale was the last of five evening auctions that produced
records, including a $120 million Munch and an $87 million
Rothko.  Two of Phillips’s three auction records were achieved in
the last few minutes.  A vibrant 10-by-6.5-foot painting by Dana Schutz titled
“Death Comes to Us All” (2003) sold for $482,500, surpassing
its high estimate and the Brooklyn artist’s previous auction
record of $288,000, set in May 2007.  ‘Dana Was a Star’  The work depicts a semi-human form with a beak nose holding
a cigarette in its hand and standing in the middle of a road.  “Dana was a star from the first time we saw her work,”
said Miami-based collector  Mera Rubell , exiting the room after
the sale. “We bought from her first show.”  How much did she pay?  “I don’t remember: $5,000? $10,000?” she said. She didn’t
buy the record-setting work.  Seth Price’s 2009 brown polystyrene panel with ropes sold
for $92,500, topping the estimate of $50,000 to $70,000 and
establishing a record for the artist.  Willem de Kooning’s 1975 painting “Untitled VI” sold for
$12.4 million, within the expected range of $10 million to $15
million. The guaranteed lot last sold at auction for $1.4
million at  Sotheby’s (BID)  in May 2000.  Christopher Wool’s 1998 aluminum panel with floral pattern
fetched $722,500, or about 25 times the amount paid by the
consigner for the work at Christie’s in May 2001.  ‘Emergency Nurse’  The seller of Claes Oldenburg’s humorous sculpture
“Popsicle, Hamburger, Price” (1961-1962) was not so lucky. It
went for $458,500, a 27 percent decline from the seller’s
purchase price of $632,000 at Christie’s in 2006.  When Prince’s 2004 canvas “Emergency Nurse” came on the
block with a presale estimate of $3 million to $5 million,
auctioneer Simon de Pury tried humor after the work failed to
elicit a single bid.  “It can come in very handy, the emergency nurse,” he
implored.  The audience wasn’t convinced.  “Passed,” de Pury said and hit the gavel on the unsold
lot.  Muse highlights include  Jeremy Gerard  on theater and  Lewis
Lapham  on books.  To contact the reporter of this story:
