Emirates Integrated
Telecommunications Co. (DU) , known as Du, is looking at entering
foreign markets such as  Saudi Arabia , the National reported,
citing Chief Executive Officer Osman Sultan.  The company would enter foreign markets as a mobile virtual
network operator, piggybacking on other operatorsâ€™ networks to
sell services to households, rather than build its own
infrastructure outside the United Arab Emirates, the newspaper
cited Sultan as saying. Saudi Arabia plans to issue three
licenses for such operators, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
