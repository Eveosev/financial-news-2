Bulgaria  and  Greece  plan to complete
the construction of a 200-million euro ($258 million) pipeline
connecting their natural gas grids by 2015, said Elio Ruggeri,
chief executive officer of IGI Poseidon SA.  The 180-kilometer (112-mile) link will run from Komotini in
Greece to Stara Zagora in Bulgaria and will be open to ship gas
from the Caspian, the Mediterranean, or from a liquefied natural
gas terminal in Turkey, Ruggeri said in an interview in the
capital Sofia today. Its initial annual carrying capacity will
be 3 billion to 5 billion cubic meters.  Bulgaria imports all of its gas from  Russia  and plans to
diversify supplies. A 24 million-euro interconnecting pipeline
with Romania’s grid will be completed in 2013. Similar pipelines
with Turkey and Serbia are being developed, according to the
Energy Ministry.  “We are now completing our engineering activities and
obtaining permits both in Greece and Bulgaria with the aim of
reaching an  investment decision  by the end of 2012 or beginning
2013,” Ruggeri said. “This will ensure that the pipeline will
be in operation either by the end of 2014 or beginning of
2015.”  IGI Poseidon SA is a venture between Greece’s natural-gas
supplier Depa and  Edison SpA (EDN) , which has an agreement with the
Bulgarian Energy Holding EAD to develop the pipe.  The group has been in contact with the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and other lenders “to structure
a financing plan” Ruggeri said, adding that “prospects are
optimistic.” A construction contractor will be selected in
2013, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
