Ethanol futures plunged to the lowest
level in almost five months as corn and gasoline dropped.  Prices fell for a third day following a U.S. Agriculture
Department forecast that the 2012 corn crop would rise 20
percent to a record 14.79 million bushels, easing ethanol
production costs, and as gasoline declined on concern that the
 European debt crisis  might curtail fuel demand.  One bushel of corn makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol,
which is blended with gasoline to stretch supply and meet
federal mandates. The weakness in corn and “euro zone
pessimism” pressured prices, SCB & Associates of  Chicago  said
in an e-mailed report today.  Denatured ethanol for June delivery dropped 1.1 cents, or
0.5 percent, to settle at $2.108 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the lowest price since Dec. 16. Ethanol has fallen 4.3
percent this year.  In spot market trading, ethanol in  New York  declined 1 cent
to $2.17 a gallon and in Chicago the additive decreased 1 cent
to $2.10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast slid 1 cent to $2.295 a gallon
and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel fell 0.5 cent to $2.17.  Corn for July delivery plunged 6.5 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $5.81 a bushel in Chicago.  Gasoline for June delivery slipped 0.94 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $3.0008 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
