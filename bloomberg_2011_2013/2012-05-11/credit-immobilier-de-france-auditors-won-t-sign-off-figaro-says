Credit Immobilier de France’s 
auditors won’t sign off on the 2011 accounts because Moody’s
Investors Service has said it may cut the real-estate lender’s
credit rating by four levels,  Le Figaro  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The auditors say they can’t attest to Credit Immobilier’s
“operating continuity,” the newspaper reported today. The firm
doesn’t collect deposits, and instead borrows money in financial
markets to lend for home loans, Le Figaro reported.  Credit Immobilier had profit of about 78 million euros
($101 million) last year, equal to the level of 2010, the
newspaper reported, citing a person close to the situation.
Nothing changed at Credit Immobilier between Dec. 27, when
Moody’s confirmed the company’s rating, and Feb. 16, when it
said may lower the rating, the newspaper reported, quoting the
unidentified person.  The situation may prompt the  Finance Ministry  to seek a way
reinforce Credit Immobilier, because its model of financing in
the markets is too fragile, the daily said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
