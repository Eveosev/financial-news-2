Japanese  stocks  fell for a third day,
capping a six-week loss, as China’s inflation and factory output
data added to signs of an economic slowdown, dimming the
earnings outlook for exporters.  Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. (6305) , which relies on China
for 17 percent of its sales, lost 1.1 percent. Sony Corp. fell
to its lowest in more than 31 years after the electronics maker
forecast profit that lagged estimates.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc. (8306) ,  Japan ’s biggest lender, paced declines among banks
after  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  reported a $2 billion trading loss.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 0.6 percent to 8,953.31
at the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo  after swinging between gains and
losses at least seven times. The measure lost 4.6 percent this
week as part of the longest streak of weekly losses since July
2008. The broader Topix Index fell 0.9 percent to 758.38, with
more than seven stocks dropping for each that rose.  “The market is struggling to digest negative factors
coming in one after another,” said Koichi Kurose, chief
economist in Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd., Japan’s fifth-largest
lender by market value. “ China’s economy  doesn’t look good,
judging from reports. There are strong expectations for quick
monetary easing, but they can’t loosen regulations on real
estate.”  The Nikkei 225 has retreated 13 percent from this year’s
high on March 27 amid concern resistance to austerity measures
will worsen  Europe ’s debt crisis and that China will refrain
from further easing to spur growth.  China Inflation, Output  Stocks fell after China’s consumer prices rose 3.4 percent
in April from a year earlier after a 3.6 percent gain in March,
the government reported today. China’s industrial output rose
9.3 percent in April from a year earlier while retail sales
gained 14.1 percent, with both figures missing analyst estimates,
the government also reported today.  Hitachi Construction fell 1.1 percent to 1,554 yen. Taiyo
Yuden Co., a maker of electronic components that gets 27 percent
of its revenue, in  China , dropped 2.2 percent to 757 yen.  Weaker earnings forecasts also drove down shares, with Sony
slumping 6.4 percent to 1,136 yen, the lowest close since August
1980. The company said it expects 30 billion yen ($376 million)
in net income in the year started April 1, its first profit in
five years. The projection fell short of the 61.4 billion-yen
estimate of 18 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.8 percent
today after JPMorgan, the biggest  U.S. bank  by assets, said it
had a $2 billion trading loss as positions in credit securities
proved riskier than expected. The index gained 0.3 percent
yesterday on a report that unemployment claims last week fell to
their lowest in a month, easing concern the U.S. labor market is
faltering.  Banks Slide  Lenders were the biggest drag on the Topix today.
Mitsubishi UFJ slid 1.7 percent to 351 yen.  Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-biggest lender by market
value, dropped 2 percent to 2,355 yen.  Stocks earlier rose after the mandate to form a Greek
government passed to  Evangelos Venizelos , the socialist Pasok
leader, who is pressing for a unity coalition. The political
standoff has reignited concern that  Greece  will fail to meet
bailout terms and force an exit from the monetary union.  “Greece is unlikely to choose to exit the euro or reject a
bailout,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , chief strategist at Toyota
Asset Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of about
$23.8 billion. “Japanese companies have reported conservative
but solid earnings and remain on the path toward higher profits.
The more selling we see due to risk aversion, the more we
realize stocks are cheap.”  Nikon Jumps  Among advancing shares, Nikon Corp. jumped 8.6 percent to
2,474 yen. The camera maker forecast full-year net income of 65
billion yen, beating analysts’ estimates of 62.7 billion yen.  Stocks on the Topix are  valued  at 0.92 times book value,
compared with 2.15 for the S&P 500 and 1.38 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. A value less than one means investors can buy
companies for less than the value of their assets.  Trading volume on the Nikkei 225 was 11 percent above
the 30-day average. The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  gained 3.8
percent to 22.71, indicating traders expect a swing of 6.5
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
