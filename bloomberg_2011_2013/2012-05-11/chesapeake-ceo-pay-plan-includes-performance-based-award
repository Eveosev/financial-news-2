Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  will
introduce performance-based awards as part of Chief Executive
Officer Aubrey McClendon pay plan for 2012, after cutting his
2011 compensation by 15 percent.  The variable performance-based annual awards were approved
by the board in December, the Oklahoma City-based company said
in a proxy statement today for its June 8 annual shareholder
meeting. Chesapeake altered its CEO pay plan after holders of 42
percent of its stock last year voted against the company’s
executive compensation plan and its largest shareholders said
McClendon’s pay had been “too high,” according to the proxy.  McClendon made $17.9 million last year compared with $21
million the year before. The board announced on May 1 it will
bring in an independent chairman, stripping McClendon of the
role after Reuters reported he used personal stakes in company-
operated wells as collateral on millions of dollars in loans.  “The past month has been a challenging time for our
company,” McClendon and Pete Miller, Chesapeake’s lead
independent director, wrote in a letter to shareholders in the
filing. “We would like to take this opportunity to emphasize
the board’s continued commitment to serving the interests of our
shareholders and improving corporate governance.”  Chesapeake  fell  2.9 percent to $16.69 at 9:47 a.m. in  New
York . The shares have declined 25 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
