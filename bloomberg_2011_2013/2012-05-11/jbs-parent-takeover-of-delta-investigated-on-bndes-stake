Brazilian prosecutors started an
investigation into  JBS SA’s (JBSS3)  parent’s takeover of Delta
Construcoes SA, a construction company at the center of alleged
corruption in government contracts, because state-run
development bank BNDES owns 31 percent of the meatpacker.  Prosecutor Nivio de Freitas Silva Filho on May 9 asked the
federal prosecutor’s office to start the investigation, the
agency said in an e-mailed statement. J&F Participacoes SA, the
parent of the world’s largest beef producer, agreed to take over
Delta this month.  Delta, a contractor in President Dilma Rousseff’s flagship
housing program and 2014 World Cup projects, is suspected of
fraud and bribery to win public work bids, Deputy Mauricio
Quintela Lessa, a member of a congressional inquiry into the
accusations, said in a telephone interview from Brasilia. The
Rio de Janeiro-based company referred questions to J&F when
contacted by Bloomberg News.  Any suggestion of government involvement in the deal to
take over Delta is unfounded and the BNDES’s stake in JBS
doesn’t make it a shareholder of the meatpacker’s parent, J&F
said in a statement. The agreement to take control of Delta is
related exclusively to J&F, BNDES said in a separate statement.  Until last month, before the allegations emerged, Delta
owned 30 percent of the license to overhaul the Maracana stadium
in Rio for the global  soccer tournament .  To contact the reporter on this story:
