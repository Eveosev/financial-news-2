Asia ’s naphtha crack spread shrank to
the narrowest in more than five months, signaling reduced profit
for refiners. Vitol Group sold fuel-oil cargoes for a fourth day
in Singapore, the region’s largest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  The premium of Japan  naphtha  to London-traded Brent crude
futures fell to $68.90 a metric ton at 5:02 p.m. Singapore time
from $70.69 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
This crack spread, a measure of processing profit, is the
narrowest since Dec. 6. It is down 27 percent so far this week.  Vitol bought two 50,000-barrel cargoes of 92-RON gasoline
in Singapore, according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders
who monitored transactions on the Platts window. It purchased
one shipment for May 31 to June 4 loading from Royal Dutch Shell
Plc at $120 a barrel and paid $120.50 a barrel to Mercuria
Energy Ltd. to load from May 26 to May 30.  Fuel Oil  Vitol sold two 20,000-ton cargoes of 380-centistoke  fuel
oil  to BP Plc at $666 a ton for June 6-10 loading, according to
the Bloomberg survey. The Swiss trader sold a similar shipment
to Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd. at $667 a ton for June 1 to
5 loading. It has sold at least 180,000 tons in Singapore since
May 8.  Fuel oil was at a  discount  of $4.76 a barrel to Asian
benchmark Dubai crude at 2:06 p.m. Singapore time, according to
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The difference is
set to widen the most since the week ended March 9, indicating
bigger losses for refiners turning oil into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade fell 75 cents to $8.50 a ton, PVM said. That’s the
narrowest  viscosity spread  since Nov. 3, meaning bunker, or
marine fuel, has outpaced gains for higher-quality fuel oil.  Middle Distillates  PetroChina Co. sold 210,000 barrels of  gasoil , or diesel,
with 10 parts-per-million of sulfur from BP for May 27 to May 31
loading, according to the Bloomberg survey. The cargo changed
hands at $3.10 a barrel over benchmark quotes. Shell bought
150,000 barrels of the same grade, also known as ultra-low-
sulfur diesel, from ConocoPhillips at a $3 premium.  Trafigura Beheer BV purchased two gasoil cargoes with 0.5
percent sulfur for May 26 to May 30 loading, the survey showed.
The company paid 20 cents a barrel below benchmark quotes to a
unit of SK Innovation Co. for 150,000 barrels and 20 cents below
May prices to Glencore International Plc for 250,000 barrels.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude was at $16.40 a barrel at
2:06 p.m.  Singapore  time, PVM data showed. This  crack spread  has
narrowed 2.8 percent this week and is poised for a second weekly
decline.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after rising to
75 cents a barrel, PVM said. This  regrade  is up 50 percent from
last week, showing it has been more profitable to make  aviation
fuel  over diesel.  BP sold 100,000 barrels of  jet fuel  to Hin Leong Trading
Pte for May 26 to May 30 loading, according to the survey. The
cargo changed hands at 30 cents a barrel below benchmark quotes.  Refinery News  Honam Petrochemical Corp. completed the expansion of its
Yeochun naphtha plant, boosting annual capacity to 1 million
tons from 750,000 tons, according to a company statement. The
company becomes the biggest ethylene maker in  South Korea .  JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp. plans to announce details of
an additional refining capacity cut in the second half of fiscal
year 2012 that will end March 2013, said Mitsunori Takahagi, the
president of parent company JX Holdings Inc. The refiner will
shut 200,000 barrels a day of capacity by March 2014, adding to
400,000 barrels a day it reduced previously.  Chinese refiners cut oil processing in April to 9.03
million barrels a day, the slowest rate since October, according
to Bloomberg calculations from a statement by the National
Bureau of Statistics. The 36.96 million tons processed is 0.3
percent less than a year earlier.  Tenders  Trafigura bought 55,000 tons of 95-RON gasoline from Essar
Oil Ltd. for June loading from Vadinar, according to three
traders who declined to be identified because the information is
confidential. The Amsterdam-based trader received a discount of
about 90 cents a barrel to Singapore prices.  Litasco SA bought 40,000 tons of gasoil with 0.5 percent
sulfur from Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd. for June
loading from New Mangalore, said two traders who asked not to be
identified because the information is confidential. The unit of
OAO Lukoil paid a premium of $1.50 to $2 a barrel to Middle East
prices.  BP bought 36,000 tons of  jet fuel  from Mangalore Refinery
for June loading, according to two traders who declined to be
identified because the information is confidential. The Indian
refiner gave a discount of 50 cents to $1 a barrel to Singapore
prices.  Mangalore Refinery offered to sell 35,000 tons of naphtha
cargo for June loading, the company said in a document e-mailed
to potential buyers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
