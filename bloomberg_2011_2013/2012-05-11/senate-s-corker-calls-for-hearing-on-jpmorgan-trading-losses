JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s trading losses
are drawing congressional scrutiny, as a U.S. senator called for
a hearing on the firm’s $2 billion in trading losses.  U.S. Senator Bob Corker, a senior Republican on the Banking
Committee, asked the panel’s chairman today to hold a hearing on
the “events surrounding” the losses “as expeditiously as
possible.”  “Clearly the losses posted by JPMorgan are significant,
and as policy makers we should understand in detail what
transpired,” Corker, a Tennessee Republican, said in a letter
to Senator Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat and the panel’s
chairman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
