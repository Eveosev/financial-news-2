Spain ’s underlying inflation rate in
April fell to the lowest since October 2010 after the economy
entered its second  recession  since 2009 amid the implementation
of the deepest budget cuts in over three decades.  Core consumer prices , which exclude energy and fresh food,
rose 1.1 percent from a year earlier, compared with 1.2 percent
in March, the National Statistics Institute in Madrid said
today. The figure was in line with a median forecast by four
analysts. Headline inflation, based on European Union
calculations, was 2 percent, matching an initial estimate on
April 27.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s government, in power since
December, aims to cut the euro area’s third-largest budget
deficit by 3.2 percentage points of gross domestic product this
year even as it forecasts an economic contraction of 1.7
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
