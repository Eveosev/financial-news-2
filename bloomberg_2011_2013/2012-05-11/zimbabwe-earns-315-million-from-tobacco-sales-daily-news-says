Zimbabwe ’s farmers earned $315
million from 83.6 million kilograms (184.3 million pounds) of
tobacco since sales began in February, the Daily News said,
citing the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board.  Tobacco volumes rose 15 percent, while the price rose 58
percent compared with the same period last year, after floods
damaged the crop in  Brazil , the world’s biggest exporter of the
leaf, according to the report.  Zimbabwe may lower its target crop to below 131 million
kilograms because of erratic rainfall, the Harare-based Daily
News said on its website.  Editor:  To contact the reporter on this story:
