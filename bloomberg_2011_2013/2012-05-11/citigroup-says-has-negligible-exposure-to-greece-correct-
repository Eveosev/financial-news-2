The effect on  Citigroup Inc. (C)  of
Greece’s exit from the eurozone “wouldn’t be that large,” said
 Alberto Verme , chairman for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  “We at Citi have negligible exposure to the periphery,”
Verme said in an interview with Bloomberg HT television in
Istanbul today. “We are following the situation very closely to
make sure it won’t have a negative impact on Citi. It is a very
uncertain situation with many possible outcomes and too many
variables.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
