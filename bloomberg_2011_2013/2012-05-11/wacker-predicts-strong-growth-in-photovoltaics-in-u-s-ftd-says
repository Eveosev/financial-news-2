Wacker Chemie AG (WCH)  expects “strong”
growth in the photovoltaic market in the U.S. in 2012 and coming
years,  Financial Times Deutschland  said, citing an interview
with Konrad Bachhuber, head of Wacker’s U.S. business.  Wacker is investing $1.8 billion in a new polysilicon
factory in  Tennessee  to meet growing demand, Bachhuber told the
newspaper. Polysilicon prices have fallen after newcomers joined
the market in the past years, the German newspaper said. Several
dozen producers have exited the market and others have cut
production “drastically,” Bachhuber said, according to FTD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
