Novozymes A/S (NZYMB)  Chief Executive Officer
Steen Riisgaard said growth in demand for enzymes used in
household detergents will help the company meet a target for
increasing sales by 4 percent to 8 percent this year.  Biofuel production fell short of predictions in the first
quarter, curbing sales of the enzymes needed to break down the
crops used in the process. Enzyme-use in detergents, food
products and animal nutrition is advancing and demand will
compensate for any shortfall in biofuel, Riisgaard said in an
interview in London yesterday.  “I’ve been in the business 32 years and I’ve yet to see a
year when everything goes exactly as planned,” Riisgaard said.
Depending on the economic conditions, Novozymes’s sales growth
will likely be around the middle of the target range, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
