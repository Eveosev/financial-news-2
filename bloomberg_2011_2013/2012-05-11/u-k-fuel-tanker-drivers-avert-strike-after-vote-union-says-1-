Fuel-tanker drivers in the U.K. have
averted  strike action  that threatened to leave gasoline stations
dry by voting to accept the offer from employers, according to
Unite, the country’s largest labor union.  Members of the union working for seven major oil
distribution firms, voted by 51 percent in favor of proposals
including the introduction of an industrywide accreditation
covering health safety and training, Unite said today in a
statement on its website.  About 2,000 drivers delivering gasoline and diesel to 90
percent of the nation’s 8,700 filling stations would have been
involved in industrial action after they voted in March to
strike and the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service,
or Acas, was called in to mediate.  The government was prepared to use the army to ensure
deliveries to forecourts. About 1,400 military drivers were
trained in the event of a strike, the Department of Energy and
Climate Change said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
