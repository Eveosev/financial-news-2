Grohe Holding GmbH, a maker of
bathroom fixtures, has asked for European and U.S. lenders to
commit to its 300 million-euro ($397 million) loan by 5 p.m.
 London  and New York-time today respectively, according to a
person with direct knowledge of the deal.  The first-lien  term loan , which will be denominated in
euros and dollars, is being arranged by Credit Suisse Group AG,
Deutsche Bank AG and Morgan Stanley and proceeds will be used to
refinance 300 million euros of outstanding 2014 floating-rate
bonds, said the person, who declined to be identified as the
terms are private.  The company may pay interest at 550 basis points more than
euro interbank offered rate for the loan, with a 1.25 percent
floor on the benchmark lending rate, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The deal may be priced at 98.5 cents on the euro,
reducing the proceeds for Grohe and boosting the yield to
investors. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Lenders attended bank meetings in London on May 2 and in
 New York  on May 4, said the person. The deadline for commitments
was originally May 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
