Chinese stocks  fell to a two-week
low, led by developers after Soufun Holdings Ltd., a real estate
website owner, said the nation may continue property curbs this
year.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  lost 0.3 percent to 2,404.31
as of the city’s 11:30 a.m. break. Five stocks declined for
every four that rose in the gauge, which was poised for its
lowest close since April 27. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  dropped 0.3
percent to 2,649.14.  Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048) , the nation’s
second-largest publicly traded developer, dropped 1.3 percent.
SAIC Motor Corp. led declines among consumer companies.  Benchmark indexes declined even after government data
showed growth in  China ’s  consumer prices  slowed to 3.4 percent
in April from 3.6 percent the previous month. Inflation stayed
below the government’s 4 percent annual goal for a third month.
The  Shanghai  Composite has climbed 9.3 percent this year on
expectations the government will relax monetary policies and
take more measures to bolster equities.  “Though inflation eased, investors had wanted it to fall
even more, so stocks remained lower,” said Cao Xuefeng, an
analyst at Huaxi Securities Co. in Chengdu. “The Chinese
economy will stabilize in the second quarter and third quarter,
so that will boost stocks if you hold on long enough.”  The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-
traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, fell 0.3 percent to 98.39,
the weakest close since Jan. 24 in  New York  yesterday.  Liquidity Tools  About 8.2 billion shares changed hands in the Shanghai
Composite yesterday, 3 percent higher than the daily average
this year. Thirty-day  volatility  in the gauge was at 17.2 today.
Stocks in the gauge are valued at 10.3 times estimated earnings,
compared with a record low of 8.9 times on Jan. 6, according to
weekly  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  The inflation data came after the People’s Bank of China
said in its first-quarter monetary policy report that it’s
concerned about upside risk in prices. Overall price gains have
remained in a downward trend but are unstable, according to the
report. The central bank said it will use a combination of
liquidity tools including bank reserve-ratio changes to adjust
cash in the banking system, according to the report.  “The central bank will probably cut the reserve ratio
requirement this weekend or the latest by next weekend,” Chen Liqiu, a strategist at Jianghai Securities Co. in Shanghai, said
by phone today. “The requirement is still a bit high and it
appears that inflation could ease further in the next two
months.”  The central bank has cut reserve ratios once this year
after boosting them and  interest rates  in 2010 and 2011 to tame
inflation. Borrowing costs have not been reduced since 2008.
 China’s economy  grew at the slowest pace since the second
quarter of 2009 in the first three months of this year, as the
European debt crisis and sluggish U.S. recovery crimped demand
for the world’s largest exporting nation.  Investor Confidence  Figures on industrial production, fixed-asset investment,
retail sales and new  yuan  lending are due at 1:30 p.m.  A 51 percent majority of finance professionals in a
quarterly Bloomberg Global Poll said they are confident in the
policies of President  Hu Jintao . The share was the same as in
January, unaffected by the aftermath of former Chongqing
Communist Party head  Bo Xilai ’s March ouster, which clouded the
outlook for this year’s once-in-a-decade leadership change.  China’s economy will either improve or remain stable this
year, according to 68 percent of respondents, with the share
anticipating a deterioration falling to 30 percent, the lowest
level since the question was first included in the poll in
September.  Lower Revenue  Poly Real dropped 1.3 percent to 12.62 yuan.  Gemdale Corp. (600383) 
retreated 1.1 percent to 6.42 yuan. Over 60 percent home buyers,
developers and experts think the home price won’t fall to a
“reasonable” level this year, Soufun Holdings Ltd. said
yesterday in an e-mailed report.  51job Inc., a Shanghai-based recruiting service provider,
sank 8.3 percent in New York, the most since Sept. 30, to
$51.30.  Second-quarter (JOBS)  sales will be between $57.2 million and
$59.5 million in the second quarter, compared with revenue of
$60.5 million in the first three months of this year, the
company said in a statement after markets closed on May 9.  7 Days Group Holdings Ltd. (SVN) , a budget hotel operator based
in  Guangzhou , China, fell 5.7 percent to $10.88, the lowest
close since July 2010. Sales will climb to as much as 640
million yuan ($101 million) in the three month ending in June
from 546 million yuan in the previous quarter, the company said
on May 9. The median  forecast  of seven analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for an increase to 647 million yuan.  Average revenue per share for Chinese companies in the
Bloomberg China-US gauge may decline to $10.10, the lowest level
since the second quarter of 2010, from $11.70 in the first three
months of this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Of the 23 companies on the China-US index that have
reported quarterly earnings since April 1, 10 fell short of
analysts’ predictions, from  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (YZC) , China’s
fourth-largest producer, and  China Telecom Corp. (CHA) , the nation’s
biggest fixed-line carrier, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  -- Editors: Darren Boey, Richard Frost  To contact the reporter on this story:
