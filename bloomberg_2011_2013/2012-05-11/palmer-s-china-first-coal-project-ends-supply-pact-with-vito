Australian mine developer  Clive Palmer  said his planned $8 billion China First  coal  project
terminated a supply contract with energy trading company Vitol
Group, denying a report by the Sydney Morning Herald.  The newspaper’s claim that Geneva-based Vitol had canceled
the $40 billion supply contract was misleading and false, Palmer
said today in an e-mailed statement. A separate $60 billion
supply contract with China Power International Holding Ltd.
remains in place, he said.  Palmer’s companies China First Pty and Waratah Coal Pty.
are proposing to develop the project in Queensland state’s
Galilee basin to export the fuel to Asia. Last month, he said he
plans to build a 21st-century replica of the Titanic and sail it
from  England  to  New York  accompanied by the Chinese navy by the
end of 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
