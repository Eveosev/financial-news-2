Oil options volatility was little
changed as the underlying futures traded in a range of about $3
this week.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 26.98 percent at 2:45 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , up from 26.9 percent yesterday.
Volatility, which was below 21 percent two weeks ago, rose to
28.17 percent May 8 after prices dropped $9 over five sessions.  “We’ve found a new intraday range here for now, unless
something breaks down further for  Europe ,” said Fred Rigolini,
vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York . “We need
some big news. As long as we stay above $95 and below $100,
you’re going to see volatility slowly come in if this persists
for another week or so.  Crude oil for June delivery fell 95 cents, or 1 percent, to
settle at $96.13 a barrel on the Nymex. Futures this week traded
between an intraday high of $98.24 and a low of $95.17.  Futures dropped today as  China ’s industrial growth slowed
in April and  Greece  struggled to form a new government,
increasing concern it would leave the euro.  The most-active oil options in electronic trading today
were June $100 calls, which fell 21 cents to 13 cents a barrel
at 2:53 p.m. with 3,346 lots trading. June $90 puts were the
second-most active options with 2,875 lots changing hands as
they rose 3 cents to 9 cents.  Calls Trading  Calls accounted for 53 percent of electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  “There was no real scrambling to buy puts,” Rigolini
said. “September $75 puts was an active one today and somebody
was buying a bunch of June $90 puts.”  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bullish bets accounted for 55 percent of the 145,228 trades
in the previous session. June $102 calls were the most actively
traded, with 7,520 lots changing hands. They fell 4 cents to 11
cents a barrel. The next-most active options, June $95 puts,
declined 22 cents to 66 cents on volume of 6,560.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 39,851
contracts. Next were December $70 puts with 36,441 lots and
December $150 calls with 36,036.  To contact the reporters on this story:
