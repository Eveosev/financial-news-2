The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the close of trading.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  dropped 0.2 percent to 15,017.55, while the
 Colcap Index (COLCAP)  decreased 0.2 percent to 1,775.80.  Bancolombia SA (BCOLO)   slumped 2.5 percent to 28,700
pesos. Colombia’s biggest lender fell for a second day after
reporting consolidated first-quarter net income of 445.6 billion
pesos ($252.5 million), trailing the 448.3 billion pesos average
forecast of four analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Profit rose 27
percent from a year earlier.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE)  , which operates
Colombia’s largest oil field, gained 0.9 percent to 49,800
pesos, rebounding from a 1.4 percent drop yesterday after it
reported first-quarter earnings.  In a note to clients today, BTG Pactual analysts led by
Gustavo Gattass called the quarterly results “not so good at
first glance, but solid in the details.”  What appeared at first as “a weak operational result” was
driven by a higher inventory buildup than expected, the analysts
wrote. “Adjusting for these delayed sales volumes, we’d see an
operational performance that exceeded our expectations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
