India ’s rupee halted a five-week
decline as the central bank took steps to boost the supply of
dollars and stem  Asia ’s worst exchange-rate loss this quarter.  The  Reserve Bank  of India yesterday cut the amount of
overseas income companies can hold in foreign currency to 50
percent from 100 percent,  forcing  them to convert earnings. On
May 4, the monetary authority raised  interest rates  on non-rupee
deposits by as much as 300 basis points and freed up borrowing
costs on foreign-exchange loans to exporters.  “The easier norms for capital inflows, particularly
deposits and foreign borrowings, by the RBI” will help improve
dollar supply, Tushar Poddar and Vishal Vaibhaw, analysts in
Mumbai at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., wrote in a report today.
“Overall, we have taken a sanguine view of limited rupee
depreciation.”  The rupee was little changed this week at 53.4850 per
dollar as of 9:37 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency, which has lost 4.9 percent this
quarter, declined 0.2 percent today.  The rupee’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 11.66 percent.  Six-month onshore currency forwards were trading at 55.08 a
dollar, compared with 55.05 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 55.29 from 55.25. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
