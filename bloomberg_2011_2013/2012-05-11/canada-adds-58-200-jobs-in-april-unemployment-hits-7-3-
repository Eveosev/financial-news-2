Canadian  employment  rose almost six
times faster than economists forecast in April, led by private-
sector and full-time positions, creating the largest two-month
increase in more than 30 years and leading investors to raise
bets on higher  interest rates .  Employment rose by 58,200 following a March jump of 82,300
that was the biggest since September 2008, Statistics Canada
said today in Ottawa. The  labor force  grew by 72,500, lifting
the  jobless rate  to 7.3 percent from 7.2 percent. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a 10,000 gain in jobs and
7.3 percent unemployment, according to the median forecasts.  Canada’s recovery may prompt central bank Governor Mark Carney to raise borrowing costs this year, leading the Group of
10 nations,  according to   Toronto-Dominion Bank. (TD)  The  Bank of
Canada  said last month higher interest rates may be needed
because of faster-than-expected growth, while a report yesterday
showed a fifth straight  trade surplus .  “It’s the strongest vote of confidence you can get,” said
 John Clinkard , economist at Deutsche Bank AG in Toronto, in a
telephone interview. Companies are “catching up” after
delaying hiring earlier in the recovery, he said.  Canada’s dollar appreciated 0.6 percent to 99.63 cents per
 U.S. dollar  at 10:08 a.m. in Toronto. Earlier it weakened as
much as 0.3 percent. Bonds fell, with the yield on the 2-year
government benchmark rising nine basis points to 1.33 percent.  Investor Bets  Investors increased bets the Bank of Canada will raise its
 key interest rate  from 1 percent later this year after the jobs
report. Trading in overnight index swaps show about a 42 percent
chance the rate will be 1.25 percent after the bank’s Sept. 5
meeting, up from 36 percent yesterday. Today’s data also show
about a 45 percent chance the rate will be unchanged in
September.  Private companies added 85,800 workers in April while
public-sector employment fell by 19,200,  Statistics Canada  said.
Full-time employment increased 43,900 in April following March’s
70,000 rise. Part-time positions climbed by 14,300, Statistics
Canada said.  The  construction industry  posted the largest increase with
24,600 new jobs. Manufacturing added 23,800 positions and
education rose by 16,800.  Ikea Group said May 8 it has started expanding a Montreal
furniture store to make it the biggest in  North America .  Natural resources employment grew by 11,000 in April,
leading all industries with a year-over-year increase of 12.5
percent, Statistics Canada said.  Quebec Gains  Quebec added 23,300 jobs to lead all provinces, the report
shows, followed by 19,700 in British Columbia and 10,700 in
Alberta. Ontario saw a loss of 7,700 in the month.  The 140,500 increase in employment in March and April was
the largest two-month gain since January and February 1981, when
143,300 jobs were created, according to Statistics Canada.  The job surge follows a May 8 report that housing starts
rose 14 percent last month to the highest since September 2007.
Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  has said he’s balancing
signs of domestic strength against the risk that global risks
such as  Europe ’s debt crisis will erode demand.  Canada’s  gross domestic product  unexpectedly shrank 0.2
percent in February on mining shutdowns and the first drop in
manufacturing in six months, Statistics Canada said April 30.  ‘Set the Stage’  “Today’s data combined with a robust housing starts report
for April set the stage for stronger growth in the second
quarter,” said  Dawn Desjardins , assistant chief economist at
Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto. “On the domestic front,
activity indicators are sturdy enough for the Bank of Canada to
lean to reducing monetary policy stimulus.” She predicts a
fourth-quarter rate increase.  Average hourly  earnings  of permanent employees rose 2.4
percent in April from a year earlier, slower than the prior
reading of 2.5 percent. Both figures exceed the 2 percent
inflation target set by the Bank of  Canada , which says the wage
measure is a key indicator of inflation pressure.  Workers classified as employees by Statistics Canada rose
by 66,600 while the self-employed decreased by 8,400 in April.  Public administration work fell by 32,400 positions in
April, Statistics Canada said, and retailing and wholesaling
jobs fell by 18,400.  Finance Minister Jim Flaherty’s March 29 budget showed
plans for 19,200 federal government job cuts, or 4.8 percent of
the total, to help eliminate a  budget deficit . About 7,200 of
those reductions will come through attrition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
