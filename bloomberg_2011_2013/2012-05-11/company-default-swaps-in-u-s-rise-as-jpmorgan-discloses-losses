A gauge of corporate credit risk rose
to the highest level in more than three months after  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  reported a $2 billion dollar trading loss.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, added 2 basis points to a mid-price of 106.1
basis points at 8:44 a.m. in New York, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg.  The swaps index climbed as JPMorgan’s Chief Executive
Officer  Jamie Dimon  said an “egregious” failure on its
synthetic credit securities led to losses in its chief
investment office. The positions may cost an additional $1
billion this quarter or next, he told analysts yesterday.  The credit-default swaps measure, which typically rises as
investor confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, last
closed at a higher level on Jan 19 at 108.1 basis points. The
contracts pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet
its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis
point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
