Azerbaijan’s sovereign-credit grade
outlook was cut by  Fitch Ratings  because the Caspian Sea nation
raised spending as oil output declined.  Fitch lowered its outlook to stable from positive,
reaffirming its BBB- rating, the lowest investment grade and on
a par with Iceland, Latvia and Croatia. Moody’s Investors
Service and  Standard & Poor’s  have both assigned Azerbaijan
their minimum investment ratings.  “The general government increased spending by more than
expected in 2011 and oil production fell unexpectedly sharply,”
Charles Seville, director of Fitch’s sovereign team, said today
in an e-mailed statement from  London . “At the same time, the
agency recognizes that the sovereign balance sheet continues to
strengthen, and that the general government is running
substantial surpluses.”  Azerbaijan is the former  Soviet Union ’s third-largest oil
producer, with foreign companies such as BP Plc among investors
in its  energy industry . Output decreased to 45.6 million tons
last year from 51 million tons in 2010.  While production stabilized in the first quarter from the
previous three months, it won’t recover to its 2010 peak of 1
million barrels a day before 2014, Fitch said. Output is more
volatile than in other oil-producing nations with similar credit
grades such as Russia and Kazakhstan, both rated BBB, it added.  A political shock, either domestic or external, may put
downward pressure on Azerbaijan’s ratings, Fitch said, adding
that “extra-parliamentary opposition to the government,
although minor, has been on an upswing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
