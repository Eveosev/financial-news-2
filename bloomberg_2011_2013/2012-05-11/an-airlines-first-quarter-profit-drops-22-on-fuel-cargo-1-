Lan Airlines SA (LAN) ,  Latin America ’s
largest carrier by market value, reported a 22 percent drop in
first-quarter profit as fuel costs rose and growth in cargo
operations slowed.  Net income fell to $76.1 million from $97.2 million a year
earlier, the Santiago-based company said in an e-mailed
statement after the close of trading. The average estimate of
four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News was $73.9 million.  “Results this quarter were impacted by a 14.7 percent
increase in fuel prices and a more challenging environment in
the cargo business, as well as by the ongoing development of LAN
 Colombia ’s operations,” the company said.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization slumped 13 percent to $218 million. Sales rose 13
percent and operating expenses jumped 18 percent. Results
include a one-time cost of $14.3 million related to a collective
bargaining process with some unions, Lan said.  Passenger capacity probably will expand 12 percent to 14
percent this year, mainly driven by the net delivery of 13
aircraft, Lan said in the statement. Cargo capacity growth is
forecast at 3 percent to 5 percent, it said.  “The reduction in cargo capacity expansion reflects a more
challenging demand and competitive environment in the global
cargo markets,” Lan said.  Lan expects to complete its $3.7 billion acquisition of
Brazilian carrier  Tam SA (TAMM4)  on June 15 following a public purchase
offer that began yesterday, Lan said in a separate statement
today.  Lan shares closed little changed at 13,238 pesos in
Santiago trading today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
