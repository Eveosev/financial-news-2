ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. On NYSE Liffe in London,
cocoa futures for July delivery fell as much as 1.4 percent.  Also on ICE, raw-sugar futures for July delivery slid 0.3

second day. Gasoil dropped, while the spread between first and
second-month contracts narrowed on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London.  Falling demand for oil products in Europe and the U.S. will
probably lead to more refineries closing and the cancellation of
existing projects even as new entrants buy shuttered sites, the
 International Energy Agency  said today.  Gasoline barges for loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp
traded at $1,013 to $1,022 a metric ton, according to a survey

of 28,000 tons changed hands.  Gasoline fell for a second day on speculation that China’s

will curtail global fuel demand.  Gasoline for June delivery fell 2.09 cents, or 0.7 percent,
