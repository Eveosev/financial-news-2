Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas
President  Richard Fisher  said  Texas  banks are more profitable
than their counterparts in other states and suggested that a
benchmark for financial distress known as the Texas ratio be
renamed the Georgia ratio for the state with the most troubled
banks.  “Just as we have outpaced others in  job creation , our
banking industry has outperformed the nation,” Fisher said
today in remarks prepared for the Texas Bankers Association
meeting in Fort Worth. “But what’s most notable is that this
marks the fifth consecutive year that Texas banks have done
better than their counterparts nationwide in terms of
profitability.”  Texas banks have had higher profit, lower loan losses and
few institutions near failure since the 2008 financial crisis,
Fisher said. The Dallas Fed on May 1 laid out a plan calling for
new limits on taxpayer aid to failing financial firms, including
the removal of chief executives and the voiding of bonus
contracts.  Fewer than 1 percent of Texas banks have a Texas ratio
exceeding 100 percent, compared with 4.6 percent nationwide and
24 percent in Georgia, Fisher said. The ratio compares
delinquent loans and real estate to tangible bank capital and
the allowance for loan losses.  Fisher, 63, didn’t comment on the  U.S. economy  or monetary
policy in his prepared remarks. He has been president of the
Dallas Fed since 2005. His district includes Texas, northern
Louisiana and southern  New Mexico .  To contact the reporters on this story:
