Gulf Coast gasoline rose versus
futures as  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  shut a hydrocracker at its Beaumont
refinery in Texas.  The unit was closed after a recycle compressor tripped at
the plant, according to a filing late yesterday with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality.  The discount for regular, 87-octane gasoline in the Gulf
Coast narrowed 0.62 cent to 17.13 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:09 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell
0.52 cent to $2.8275 a gallon.  Planned maintenance is under way at the Phillips 66
refinery in Borger, Texas,  Rich Johnson , a Houston-based
spokesman for the company, said in an e-mailed statement.  The same fuel in Chicago strengthened 6 cents to a discount
of 3 cents versus futures. It is the highest level since May 1.  Citgo Petroleum Corp. released sulfur dioxide to a flare
after a mechanical failure at its refinery in Lemont, Illinois,
according to a filing with the National Response Center. The
release at 7:30 p.m. local time yesterday wasn’t secured, the
filing showed.  The plant had a release of an unknown amount of natural gas
and propane from a flare after a “power blip,” according to a
center filing on May 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
