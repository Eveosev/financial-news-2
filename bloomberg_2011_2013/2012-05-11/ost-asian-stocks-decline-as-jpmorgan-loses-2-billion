with the regional index capping its worst week in almost six
months, as JPMorgan Chase & Co. revealed a $2 billion trading
loss and  China ’s industrial output grew at a slower pace, while
Indian factory production fell.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. , the world’s
biggest lender by market value, dropped 1.4 percent in Hong Kong.

coming in one after another,” said Koichi Kurose, chief
economist in Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd., Japan’s fifth-largest
lender by market value. “ China’s economy  doesn’t look good,
judging from reports. There are strong expectations for quick
monetary easing, but they can’t loosen regulations on real
estate.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  declined 0.9 percent to 118.59
as of 5:50 p.m. in Tokyo, with more than three shares falling
for each that rose. The measure is heading for 4.4 percent drop

political changes and instability in Greece threaten to derail
austerity plans and worsen  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index slid 0.2 percent. South

also known, dropped 1.4 percent to HK$4.89 in  Hong Kong .  China

output at the nation’s factories unexpectedly contracted in
March amid weaker domestic demand and exports.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.4
percent today as JPMorgan revealed a $2 billion trading loss on
credit securities. The index rose 0.3 percent yesterday as
weekly U.S. jobless claims fell to a month low, showing
continued recovery in the labor market.  “Clearly JPMorgan got it wrong,” said  Shane Oliver ,
Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP Capital
Investors Ltd., which has almost $100 billion under management.
“I suspect it’s probably a one-off, but it comes during a week
where we’ve seen risk off in a big way.”  Sony, Yamada Denki  Sony sank 6.4 percent to 1,135 yen in Tokyo, the lowest
close since August 1980. The company said profit this fiscal

through yesterday, compared with an 8 percent gain by the  S&P
500  and a 2.7 percent advance by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
