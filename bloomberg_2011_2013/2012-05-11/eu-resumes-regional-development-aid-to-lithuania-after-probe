The European Commission resumed
regional development aid to Lithuania after the  Finance Ministry 
provided additional information about the use and distribution
of the cohesion funds.  The commission had suspended 163 million euros ($211
million) in aid in February after reviewing a report by the
Lithuanian state auditor, which required additional explanation
on the distribution of the funds, the Finance Ministry in the
capital, Vilnius, said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
