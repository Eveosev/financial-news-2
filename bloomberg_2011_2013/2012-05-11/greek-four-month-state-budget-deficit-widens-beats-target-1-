Greece ’s state budget deficit in the
first four months of 2012 beat a target set out under the
country’s loan accords with the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund .  The shortfall, which excludes spending by state-owned
institutions and companies, was 9.1 billion euros ($11.8
billion) compared with a target of 11 billion euros, according
to an e-mailed statement from the Athens-based  Finance Ministry .
The January-through-April deficit in 2011 was 7.4 billion euros,
the ministry said.  Greece’s political party leaders are in a fifth day of
talks to form a government after inconclusive May 6 elections
gave no party a parliamentary majority. Under the terms of its
second bailout in March, Greece must detail savings of 11
billion euros next month.  The primary deficit in the first four months narrowed to
1.68 billion euros from 3.56 billion euros a year earlier.
Ordinary budget revenue was 14.7 billion euros, compared with a
target of 15 billion euros, while ordinary spending was 24.3
billion euros compared with a target of 25.8 billion euros, the
ministry said.  Greece’s general budget gap will widen to 8.4 percent of
gross domestic product in 2013 from a projected 7.3 percent this
year if a new government doesn’t pass additional spending cuts
of 3.8 percent of GDP in the coming months, the European
Commission said in a report today.  The central government’s cash deficit narrowed to 3.1
billion euros in the first four months from 6.8 billion euros in
the same period in 2011, the  Bank of Greece  said in a separate
statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
