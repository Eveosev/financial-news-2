Switzerland  said it’s still in
discussions with the U.S. to resolve a tax-evasion probe after a
Zurich-based newspaper reported that some Swiss banks rejected
proposals to help fund to a settlement.  “Discussions over a comprehensive solution with the U.S.
are ongoing,” Mario Tuor, a spokesman for State Secretariat for
International Financial Matters in the Swiss capital Bern, said
today in a phone interview.  Switzerland and the U.S. began talks last year to resolve a
Department of Justice investigation of 11 Swiss financial firms
suspected of helping Americans hide money from the  Internal
Revenue Service .  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , the second-biggest
Swiss bank, set aside 295 million Swiss francs ($318 million)
for U.S. tax matters while  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER)  and HSBC
Holdings Plc’s Swiss private bank have also said they may pay a
fine to resolve the issue.  Swiss banks can’t agree on the terms of a settlement with
the U.S.,  Tages-Anzeiger  reported earlier today, without saying
where it got the information.  Thomas Sutter, a spokesman for the Basel-based Swiss
Bankers Association, declined to comment on whether member-firms
have objected to paying a penalty to the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
