The European Commission raised its
 economic-growth  forecast for  Poland  to 2.7 percent, the fastest
in the European Union, citing domestic demand and public
spending on the Euro 2012 soccer championship.  The estimate was increased from a February outlook of 2.5
percent, the EU’s executive arm in Brussels said in a statement
today. The EU’s largest eastern member’s economy may slow to 2.6
percent growth in 2013, it said.  The EU’s forecast is above the 2.5 percent prediction by
Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s government for 2012. Poland is
weathering the recession predicted for the 17-nation euro
region, its biggest trading partner, driven by domestic demand
and public investment in preparations for the Euro 2012 soccer
championship.  “Domestic demand is projected to remain the main driver of
growth, but the focus is expected to continue to shift from
consumption to investment,” the commission said. “Companies
are set to benefit from the  currency depreciation  and use their
profits to renew their machinery in preparation for an expected
upturn in the cycle.”  The zloty weakened 0.4 percent to 4.2431 per euro at 11:31
a.m. in Warsaw, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Narrowing Deficit  The commission estimates the Polish government will narrow
the  budget deficit  to 3 percent of gross domestic product this
year from 5.1 percent in 2011, suggesting the country will meet
this year’s deadline set by the EU to narrow the shortfall
within the bloc’s limit. Failing to do so would have cost the
country access to development grants that helped the country
avoid recession in 2009.  “In 2012, despite a considerably slower GDP growth, the
deficit is expected to decrease to 3 percent of GDP on the back
of the 2011 package of structural consolidation measures,” the
European Commission said in its report.  For next year, “the headline deficit is expected to fall
to 2.5 percent on the back of slowing but still relatively
robust GDP growth and further sharp decrease in public
investment,” it said.  Debt may fall to 55 percent of GDP from 56.3 percent in
2011, the report said.  The commission also raised Slovakia’s  growth  forecast to
1.8 percent this year from a previous estimate of 1.1 percent.
It kept the 2013 forecast unchanged at 2.9 percent.  “While the sizable increase in manufacturing production
underpinned a sustained increase in export market shares in
2011, the outlook for 2012 appears less rosy,” for Slovakia,
the commission said. “With four-fifths of the total exports
directed towards the single European market, where activity
remains subdued, exports are expected to grow below their long-
term trend in 2012.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
