The European Union will give Cameroon
48 million euros ($62 million) to increase production of bananas
in the central African nation, said Raul Mateus Paula, head of
the EU delegation in the country.  The grant is meant to help Cameroon improve the quality of
the fruit and export more to the EU after the signing of an
economic partnership agreement in 2009, he told reporters in
Yaounde, the capital, yesterday.  Cameroon is  Africa ’s fourth-biggest cocoa producer and is
Central Africa’s biggest coffee grower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
