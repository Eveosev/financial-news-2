Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM) ,  East Africa ’s biggest
mobile-phone company, declined for the first time in three days
on concern sales growth will slow.  Safaricom shares  fell 1.5 percent to 3.40 shillings by the
close in Nairobi. Sales in the year to March 2013 will rise by
low- to mid-single digits, Chief Financial Officer John
Tombleson told investors in Nairobi yesterday. Sales increased
13 percent to 107 billion shillings, the company said while
reporting its 12-month results through March.  “The guidance was not convincing enough so investors are
starting to have second thoughts,” Eric Musau, a research
analyst at Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in
a phone interview today.  The stock jumped 3 percent yesterday, the most in more than
two months after the company reported a net income of 12.6
billion shillings ($150.6 million). The average estimate of five
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit of 10.4 billion
shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
