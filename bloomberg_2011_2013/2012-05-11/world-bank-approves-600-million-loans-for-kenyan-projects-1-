The  World Bank  approved $600 million
of loans to finance two infrastructure projects in  Kenya , east
Africa’s biggest economy.  An interest-free loan of $300 million will be provided for
the Water and Sanitation Services Improvement Project, the
Washington-based lender said in an e-mailed statement today. A
further $300 million will be loaned to help fund the Nairobi
Metropolitan Services Improvement Project, it said.  “Kenya is one of the most water-scarce countries in the
world, with a majority of its citizens unable to access clean
water at an affordable price,” said Johannes Zutt, the bank’s
country director for Kenya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
