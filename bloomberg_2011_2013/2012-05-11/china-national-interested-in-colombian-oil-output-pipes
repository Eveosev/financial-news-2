China  National Petroleum Corp.
officials met with the Colombian government to discuss possible
investment in oil exploration and production as well as a
pipeline project.  The meeting in Shanghai today included talks about a
pipeline that would link Venezuela to Colombia’s Pacific coast,
Colombia’s Mines and Energy Ministry said in an e-mail.  Colombian President  Juan Manuel Santos  visited China this
week to announce the start of talks for a trade agreement to
increase exports from his nation. Colombia is South America’s
largest coal producer and its third-largest oil supplier after
Brazil and Venezuela.  China, the world’s largest energy consumer, has expanded
investment in Colombia as it buys more oil, coal and copper from
across  Latin America  to supply its demand for energy and raw
materials. Sinochem Group said earlier today it will cooperate
on a Colombian pipeline project with China  Development Bank  and
 Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , Colombia’s state-run oil company.  China also is interested in supplies of higher-priced
metallurgical coal, used to process steel, and may accelerate
development of mines producing coltan, used in mobile phones,
according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
