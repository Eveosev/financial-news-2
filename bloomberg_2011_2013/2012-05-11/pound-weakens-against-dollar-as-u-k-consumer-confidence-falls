The pound fell to three-week low
against the dollar after an industry report showed U.K.  consumer
confidence  dropped last month as the economy slipped into a
double-dip recession.  Sterling slid for the first time in six days versus the
euro as signs the economic outlook is worsening raised the
prospect Governor  Mervyn King  will hint at resuming bond
purchases, or quantitative easing, when the central bank
releases its Inflation Report next week. Ten-year gilts
advanced, completing a third weekly gain.  “The QE carrot is still dangling in front of the market
should we get any more weak data,” said Kit Juckes, head of
foreign-exchange research at Societe Generale SA in  London .
“We’ve made a step-adjustment down in sterling being the pick
of non-euro currencies to put money in.”  The pound dropped 0.4 percent to $1.6080 at 4:48 p.m.
London time after falling to $1.6062, the lowest since April 20.
It fell 0.4 percent this week. Sterling weakened 0.4 percent to
80.44 pence per euro, after rising to 79.97 pence, the strongest
since November 2008.  Nationwide Building Society  said its index of consumer
sentiment worsened to 44 from 53 in March. A gauge of Britons’
outlook for the economy fell to 60 in April from 73 in March,
the Swindon-based company said. A measure of whether it’s a good
time to make a  major purchase  declined to 75 from 86.  The surveys were conducted before a government report on
April 25 showed the U.K. economy shrank for a second quarter in
the three months through March.  ‘Not Off the Table’  The Monetary Policy Committee left its bond-purchase
program at 325 billion pounds yesterday amid concern inflation
is quickening. Unlike the last time it halted quantitative
easing in February 2010, it didn’t issue a statement.  “The suspicion is that more QE may not have happened, but
it’s not off the table by any stretch of the imagination,”
Juckes said. “The economy is still weak. We’ll see more when we
see the Inflation Report” on May 16, he said.  Sterling has appreciated 4.4 percent in the past three
months, the best performer of the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
gained 2.1 percent, and the euro dropped 0.2 percent.  The  10-year gilt  yield fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.96 percent after falling to a record
1.881 percent on May 9. The 4 percent bond due March 2022 rose
0.22, or 2.20 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 118.1. The
yield has declined three basis points this week.  Bill Sale  The Debt Management Office sold 1.5 billion pounds of six-
month bills at an average yield of 0.4256 percent. Investors bid
for 2.97 times the amount allotted, up from a so-called bid-to-
cover ratio of 2.45 on May 4. The office also sold one- and
three-month securities.  Gilts have handed investors a loss of 0.4 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. U.S.
Treasuries gained 0.6 percent and German bunds returned 2.2
percent, the indexes show.  King may leave the door open to add more stimulus as a
flare-up in  Europe ’s debt crisis and government spending cuts
threaten to keep Britain’s recovery at bay, according to
economists at Deutsche Bank AG and BNP Paribas SA.  “They’ll have no choice but to revise down their growth
projections” in the Inflation Report, said  George Buckley , an
economist at Deutsche Bank in London. “They have a dilemma of
high inflation and very weak growth, but you definitely can’t
rule more QE out.”  David Tinsley , an economist at BNP Paribas in London, said
the Inflation Report will present a “fairly dovish assessment”
of the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
